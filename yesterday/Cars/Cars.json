    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-kia-ev4-revealed-choice-hatch-or-saloon-bodystyles",
    "description": "Latest entrant to Kia's range of bespoke EVs fills the gap between the EV3 hatchback and EV5 crossover Kia has revealed the production design for its Volkswagen ID 3-rivalling EV4, ahead of a launch later this year. Little changed from the concept shown in 2023, the EV4 arrives to fill the gap between the EV3 hatchback and the EV5 SUV that's due to launch in Europe soon. It will be sold primarily as a five-door hatch in Europe, where it will be a natural rival to the ID 3 as well as the Hyundai Kona Electric, Renault Mégane E-Tech and the Mini Aceman. The four-door fastback, designed mainly for other global markets, looks to keep the same wheelbase but add a more rakish rear end, and with it some extra boot capacity. The brand hasn't given any specifications for the EV4 yet, but it will share its E-GMP platform with Kia's other bespoke EVs, and thus be offered with a choice of either 58kWh or 81kWh batteries and either front- or four-wheel drive. It should tout a maximum range of more than 350 miles, but is likely to stick with 400V charging for top-up speeds of up to 128kW - as with the EV3 and EV5.  All Kia EVs are destined to receive hot GT versions, so a 4WD range-topper with power and pace to match the Tesla Model 3 Performance is expected down the line. Details of the interior remain under wraps, but the EV4 concept revealed in 2023 gives a good idea of what to expect, with a sleek, minimalist dashboard topped by a wraparound digital display, a step-through front cabin and a focus on upmarket textiles throughout. The EV4 will be fully detailed on 27 February at Kia's annual EV Day showcase, where it will also reveal a concept for the EV2, a sub-four-metre electric hatchback that will take on the Volkswagen ID 2 and Renault 5 next year, with a start price of around £25,000.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/bmw-vision-driving-experience-radical-quad-motor-test-mule",
    "description": "Vision Driving Experience is test mule for Neue Klasse models The Vision Driving Experience is a test mule for the brand's next-gen vehicle dynamics technology BMW has revealed the radical Vision Driving Experience, a quad-motor high-performance text vehicle fitted with five fans designed to suck it to the ground that is being used to hone the advanced technology that will power its next-generation of Neue Klasse electric vehicles – including the forthcoming M3 EV. While the powertrain layout, featuring four high-power motors mounted on each axle of the vehicle, has clear parallels to plans for the next-generation M3, BMW insists the Vision Driving Experience serves a wider purpose as a rolling test rig – and the lack of sporty bodywork elements marks it out from spy shots of the first electric car from the Munich firm’s performance division. Because the focus is on vehicle development, BMW has not given a power output for the machine. The focus of the Vision Driving Experience is to be a high-performance machine that can be used to push development of the ‘Heart of Joy’, the new black box computer system that will combine the drivetrain and driving dynamics systems in all future Neue Klasse EV models. That system will first be seen in the next-generation iX3 that is set to be revealed later this year, and on the next-gen 3 Series saloon that will follow soon afterwards. Frank Weber, BMW’s development boss, said that the Heart of Joy system “enables us to take driving pleasure not just to the next level, but another one beyond that,” adding that the system would offer “efficient dynamics squared”. Autocar was given access to the Vision Driving Experience for a ride in the car, and to talk to the engineers who have developed it. First ride: inside the BMW Vision Driving Experience, and how it will develop a computer chip \"The engineers won’t even tell me how much power this has,” says development driver Jens Klingmann, as he casually hurls the BMW Vision Driving Experience into a corner fast enough for the tyres to howl in protest. “But it’s a lot.” Given that my insides are still churning from the hit of acceleration at the start, he didn’t really need to say that last bit. The Vision Driving Experience is, indeed, a lot. It’s a lot of car, with a lot of motors, a lot of fans (we will get to those) and a lot of performance. And it has a lot of significance for the ongoing development of BMW’s next-generation Neue Klasse EVs, which will start to arrive this year. This isn’t just your average prototype, then. But at heart that’s basically what it is: a quad-motor, high-power EV test mule styled on the next-gen 3 Series saloon, which has been pounding around various test facilities during recent months. Four motors and a ridiculous power output? That sounds quite a lot like the forthcoming first electric M3, doesn’t it? Except BMW insists the Vision Driving Experience (let’s call it the VDE for short) isn’t a test mule for the next M3. Instead, the firm describes it as a one-off test rig on wheels, a moving laboratory used to hone technology being developed for all future Neue Klasse models in an extreme environment. The development work being done with it is as relevant to the next single-motor, entry-level iX3 SUV as it will be to whatever M division’s engineers concoct for their electric offerings. Perhaps because of the development work for which it has been created, until now the VDE has been cloaked in secrecy – and we’re not just talking about its camouflage wrap. But the fact that BMW recently strapped me (thankfully tightly) into the passenger seat for a short – but very fast – ride shows that Munich now wants to showcase exactly why it has been created. Although Klingmann’s inability (or perhaps refusal) to share its power output indicates that the veil of secrecy isn’t fully lifted. What BMW has confirmed is that the VDE is powered by four electric motors – one for each wheel – and can produce peak torque of 13,269lb ft. And no, that’s not a typo. There isn’t an ofofficial power output, but given its ridiculous torque output, you can probably guess it’s pretty high. BMW hasn’t given any performance stats, either, but after my ride in it, I would say the 0-62mph time can be described as ‘brisk’. Beyond the four motors, the other thing we have been told about are those fans. Five of them, in fact. BMW calls them impellers, and they serve to literally suck the car to the ground. Each fan requires 50kW of energy to run, but combined they add around 1000kg of downforce without creating any drag, in turn allowing Klingmann to push even harder in corners. All of that torque and downforce is really there to develop one small but very significant black box full of computer chips and loaded with software. That would be BMW’s new Heart of Joy, the unusually named hardware and software stack that will unify the computer systems that run the powertrain and driving dynamics systems on future EVs into a single unit. It’s the first time BMW has unified those systems, and the firm claims the system has been developed entirely in-house. “The Heart of Joy will run all the key driving functions of the car,” says BMW driving dynamics expert Christian Thalmeier. “But to develop those, we need to push the technology. Even production cars with only one electric motor will gain advantages from the work we’re doing on a car with four motors.” It might seem like overkill to build a superpowerful, fan-laden development hack just to test a computer processing unit, but the idea is that if the Heart of Joy can handle anything the VDE can throw at it in the real world, it can handle pretty much anything. So how does it work? Traditionally, the powertrain and driving dynamics systems have been separate units. The powertrain system takes the inputs from your foot on the accelerator and sends that as a request to the powertrain, whether a combustion engine or a single or pair of electric motors. Meanwhile, a separate driving dynamics unit receives inputs from the steering wheel and brakes, along with any other data the car’s sensors might get from the external environment. Those two systems run in parallel, so there’s a small but potentially significant lag when they need to send data to each other, and there are limitations on how closely they can operate together. The Heart of Joy unites those systems into a single unit that receives all those inputs in the same place, processes them simultaneously and then sends the information to up to four motors along with the brakes, steering and so on. BMW says it allows for communication that’s up to 10 times faster than that used on cars that were on sale in 2021. That’s a big boost when trying to precisely modulate power and braking to best fit the conditions. But there are other benefits too. On most current EVs, friction braking is controlled by the driving dynamics unit while regeneration through the motors is the responsibility of the powertrain system. That’s why you can sometimes feel an imbalance if you’re slowing using the regen and then need to apply the brakes. “When recuperation is only done by the powertrain, you can’t use the whole potential of it,” says Thalmeier. “You need the driving dynamics system to work out how to enlarge the recuperation.” He cites the example of a rearbiased car – yes, future BMW EVs will still be rear-driven or rear-biased – cornering at speed. “ When there’s a load change, you can only put a certain amount of longitudinal force on the tyres before the car becomes unstable,” he says. “So to keep the car balanced, you have to take away either lateral or longitudinal force. Because you’re cornering and you can’t remove the lateral force, you have to reduce the recuperation to keep the car stable. But that’s not what we want: we want to add stability by recuperation. “Now, though, we’re so quick at taking data from the sensors on the car about yaw rate, lateral and longitudinal acceleration and how stable the car is that we can change things. If it’s still stable, we can do a bit of recuperation, and when it gets unstable, it will be quickly reduced.” There’s another benefit: the Heart of Joy can take your braking inputs and work out the most efficient way of stopping the car, which in most cases will be via the motor. That increases the use of regen, which BMW claims makes the car up to 25% more efficient. Not a huge amount but a useful gain, given that the aim is for most drivers to not know whether it’s the brakes or the motor slowing their machine. The Heart of Joy won’t just help when you’re slowing down your BMW, though: it will help you go faster. Again, a combustion car has a single power source, so systems such as variable four-wheel drive or torque vectoring have to go through various mechanical systems to divide up that power. But the new system can take power from one, two, three or four motors and continuously adjust where it’s sent to, keeping the car better balanced and more stable. Besides simply adding raw power, Thalmeier says adding motors will make a big difference to future Neue Klasse models. “We’re influencing the driving dynamics,” he adds. “If you think of three electric motors with one on the front axle and two on the rear, you can help steer with the rear axle by making one wheel faster and the other slower. \"So you can make the car agile purely through running the electric motors at different speeds. Any existing actuator or rear-wheel steering system isn’t as quick as our new electric motors will be.” Which brings us back to the passenger seat of the VDE, with Klingmann laughing as he jams the throttle and sends the machine down the straight of the BMW Spartanburg Performance Centre test track at something approaching warp speed. It’s actually surprisingly comfortable inside, with comfy sports seats and a working version of BMW’s new iDrive system on the dashboard. Even in its test hacks, Munich does premium well. But can you feel the Heart of Joy at work? Being honest, no, not really, but that’s in part because on a cold day in South Carolina tyre grip is limited and Klingmann confesses the road-legal rubber is the limiting factor. But as my innards slowly settle once I’ve escaped the passenger seat, the performance of the Vision Driving Experience – and the systems underpinning it – is clear. The closest comparison I can make is with a passenger ride in an electric rallycross supercar. Impressive, then. And it certainly whets the appetite for the potential of a quad-motor electric M3. Why five impeller fans are needed to make the car suck The BMW Vision Driving Experience’s five impeller fans are the car’s undoubted party piece, as demonstrated when its engineers fired them up for a demonstration when it was back in the garage. For a comparison of how loud they are, imagine standing underneath the wing of an Airbus A380 when the pilot presses the start button. Essentially, they serve to stick the car to the ground, adding grip without creating aerodynamic downforce. But could they ever reach production? “You won’t see anything like this in a production car,” says Thalmeier. “It’s just too expensive. They are just for the system on this car. If you have a lot of downforce and then you add a lot of torque, it makes it very hard to accelerate. What we’re interested in with this car is how to deal with the acceleration in the software. “It’s purely a development tool. It’s not even a driving dynamics tool; it’s just another thing that makes it faster for us to develop functions.”",

    "description": "In the build-up to the Rizta’s launch, Ather had released some very bold advertisements showcasing how big the scooter’s seat would be, featuring a prominent Indian professional wrestler. Naturally, I initially took all of that with a grain of salt, but now that I’ve actually used the Rizta extensively with a pillion aboard, I can confirm this is a really spacious and comfortable seat. Pillions of all shapes and sizes have sat behind me, and even the taller and heftier ones were comfortable. The backrest (standard on the Z variants) also goes some way in keeping the passenger comfortable. The well-padded seat is one of the most spacious units around, backrest keeps the pillion comfy. With just the rider aboard, the Rizta’s ride can feel a little stiff, although it’s never uncomfortable. However, when you’re carrying a passenger, this setup pays dividends and shields you from all but the worst bumps Mumbai has to offer. That said, the Rizta’s suspension is a bit of a double-edged sword, but we’ll come to the bad bits later on. As anyone who has ever ridden with a pillion will tell you, if your vehicle has a less-than-ideal throttle response, it’s going to be unpleasant, especially in stop-and-go traffic, where you need to give minute inputs almost constantly. What I absolutely love about the Rizta is its crisp and direct throttle response, which allows you to modulate the throttle very precisely in stop-and-go traffic without causing any unwanted herky-jerkiness. Accelerator response feels well-tuned in both modes, is precise and direct. What isn’t nice in our pothole-littered city, though, is the stiff front fork. It thuds over every single bump, and the big ones, especially, make their presence felt with a rather rude jolt to the rider’s hands. The 450X-derived front fork is too stiff, which hampers overall comfort over bumps. Another problem is that when you’re making a lock-to-lock U-turn, the Rizta’s handlebar fouls your knees. On a scooter with so much space in most other regards, the lack of it in this area stands out like a sore thumb. Ather has repurposed a lot of what was on the sporty 450 here, which is why these downsides have also transferred over to the Rizta. Lock-to-lock U-turns require taller riders to move their knees out of the way. But in the grand scheme of things, these are two issues I can look past, given how light the Rizta is on my pocket and, otherwise, how well it handles the daily grind in general. And since the Rizta and the 450 are quite closely related under their distinctly different skins, there are also some strong points – like the crisp handling – that I’m thoroughly enjoying.

    "description": "Few products have had as tumultuous a journey from concept to reality as the Simple One. Shown first in 2021 with a promise to go on sale in 2022, it eventually went on sale in mid-2023. Fast forward to 2025, and after 1,817 units sold (as per VAHAN data), Simple Energy has updated the One. Simple One updates for 2025 The main update is that it now has a claimed 248km IDC range, up from the original 212km. It has the same 5kWh battery capacity as before, and the company says this increase has been achieved via some electronic trickery and a more efficient drivetrain.  There was no way to test those numbers in our limited time with it, but what I can tell you is that in 45km of mixed riding in all four modes (Eco, Ride, Dash and Sonic), the battery dropped from full to 76 percent SOC. Simple One design, performance This was my first time seeing a Simple One in the flesh, and I thought it was a smashing-looking thing, even if its sharp and angular design is somewhat similar to the Ather 450’s. Quality, too, is at a pleasantly high level, and there are no flimsy plastics or uneven panel gaps. At 30 litres, the One doesn’t have the biggest boot in the segment, but its shape allows you to fit an ECE-certified full-face helmet inside comfortably.   And once you swing your leg over it, you’ll discover the One has the go to match the show. With 8.5kW and 72Nm of torque on tap, acceleration in any mode is peppy, and even in the lowest mode, it can climb flyovers without slowing down. Achieving and maintaining the claimed 105kph top speed is effortless in Dash and Sonic. However, acceleration from a standstill doesn’t feel as spirited as in the Warp mode on an Ather 450. Simple One areas of improvement The problem is that in both of the top two modes, the scooter surges forward for a second or two even once the accelerator is closed, which can put you in trouble, considering the strong performance. We reported this issue when we first rode the prototype in 2022, and it’s disappointing that it hasn’t been resolved. Simple says it is aware of it and is working on a solution, but I think this should have been ironed out before customer deliveries began.   While the scooter’s sporty design language may lead you to believe that it will be stiffly sprung, the suspension setup is rather plush, and the One is one of the more comfortable electric scooters I’ve experienced. However, at 136kg, its weight isn’t something that you can shake off, and what only compounds matters further is the tall (for a scooter) 796mm seat height.  Simple One price, verdict Currently, Simple Energy has only 10 showrooms operational. The company says it plans to scale up to 150 showrooms by March 2026 and bring in a generation two product (the one we rode was termed ‘version 1.5’) to bolster its portfolio. Ultimately, all of that is in the future, and Simple still has much to prove. Until Simple Energy scales up its dealer network and builds a good after-sales reputation, the Rs 1.66 lakh One and its more affordable sibling, the Rs 1.45 lakh Dot One, will remain niche offerings.    All prices ex-showroom, Bengaluru Also See: Simple Energy One prototype review: A simple answer?",

    "description": "The Maruti Swift has always been known for its efficiency, and the latest iteration, featuring a new three-cylinder Z-series petrol engine, continues this legacy. In real-world tests, it delivers an impressive 14kpl in the city and 19kpl on highways. To further enhance fuel savings, Maruti has introduced a compressed natural gas (CNG) variant, priced between Rs 8.20 lakh and Rs 9.20 lakh. This CNG version is available only in mid-level trims and comes at a premium of approximately Rs 90,000 over the petrol variant. Maruti Swift S-CNG design Our test Swift S-CNG is based on the ZXI trim, which is one step below the top-spec ZXI+. This means it lacks features like front fog lamps and dual-tone alloy wheels, instead sporting silver- finished 15-inch alloys. A noticeable addition is the CNG filler cap on the right rear fender that, unfortunately, looks like an aftermarket job, which it isn’t. However, the overall design remains youthful and retains the fourth-generation Swift’s signature curves and silhouette. Maruti Swift S-CNG interior Inside, the Swift maintains its minimalist, all-black cabin layout. While it is functional and user- friendly, certain omissions, such as the absence of cruise control buttons on the steering wheel, are evident. The monochrome multi-information display (MID) looks quite basic, but an interesting addition is the dual fuel gauge – one for petrol and another for CNG. Seat comfort The 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system, though nice to use, appears small within its oversized bezel. Seat comfort is good, ergonomics are spot on, and the rear seats offer adequate space for two adults. However, practicality takes a hit due to the 55-litre CNG cylinder occupying most of the boot, leaving just enough room for a soft cabin bag. The visible CNG cylinder mounting and lack of boot cladding don’t make for a pleasing sight. Additionally, the CNG variant does not include a spare tyre. Dual fuel gauge – one for petrol and one for CNG – is a nice addition. Equipment list While on that topic, the Swift S-CNG has a decent list of features. These include automatic LED headlamps, a rear wiper and washer, a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system with six speakers, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, automatic climate control, rear AC vents, a wireless charger, and crucial safety features such as an electronic stability program (ESP), six airbags, and hill-start assist. However, it lacks fog lamps and a rear-view camera. Maruti Swift S-CNG performance and efficiency By default, it switches on in petrol mode, and later switches to CNG automatically. By default, the Swift S-CNG starts on petrol, and once the engine reaches optimal temperatures, it automatically switches to CNG with an audible mechanical ‘clang’. We’re happy to report that despite being nearly 70 kilograms heavier than its petrol counterpart and 12hp and 10Nm down on power and torque, respectively, the Swift does its urban duties very competently. This 1.2-litre three-cylinder Z-Series engine’s clear focus on drivability and crisp throttle responses (even in CNG mode) ensures that most owners will find no reason to complain. And while it doesn’t warrant constant gear shifts to get a move on, owners are likely to appreciate its light clutch and buttery-smooth 5-speed manual transmission, which not only removes the stress from driving but makes for a pleasurable driving experience. 0-100kph time Maruti Suzuki Swift CNG: performanceSpeedCNG modePetrol mode0-20kph1.23s1.55s0-40kph3.22s3.05s0-60kph6.26s5.57s0-80kph9.77s8.51s0-100kph15.54s13.03s20-80kph (in 3rd gear)14.75s13.22s40-100kph (in 4th gear)21.5s9.26s Performance tests show the Swift S-CNG accelerates from 0-100kph in 15.5 seconds, which is 1.5 seconds slower than the petrol variant. In rolling acceleration tests, too, it was slower than its petrol-only counterpart, taking 1.5 seconds more in the 20-80kph third-gear sprint and 3.3 seconds more in the 40-100kph fourth-gear test. In our real world tests, the Swift S-CNG's overall fuel efficiency is identical to its claimed range. More importantly, the Swift S-CNG excels in fuel efficiency. In CNG mode, it returned 24.35 km/kg in city conditions and an impressive 31.38 km/kg on the highway, averaging 27.85 km/kg, which is close to the claimed figures. Maruti Swift S-CNG ride and handling Even in its CNG avatar, the Swift remains a fun to drive car. The rear suspension is slightly stiffer than the petrol variant to accommodate the additional weight of the CNG cylinder. The ride remains comfortable within city limits, but at highway speeds, sharper movements can be felt inside the cabin. The steering is light and effortless, with a natural returnability after turns. On the whole, the Swift S-CNG remains just as fun and enjoyable to drive as it is expected to be. Maruti Swift S-CNG verdict The Swift S-CNG’s dearth of luggage space and a missing spare tyre make it less practical for long highway journeys. Buyers looking for the absolute top-spec variant with all features may also find it lacking. However, its user-friendly nature, smooth driving experience, and outstanding fuel efficiency make it an excellent economical choice for city commutes.

    "description": "Sandy brown, misty gold, light beige. That’s how people described the Q8’s new Sakhir Gold paint shade. The colour proved to be a big talking point in the time the car was with me. Most loved it, often saying it was nice, different and eye-catching. Indeed, in a world of greys and silvers, the Q8’s Sakhir Gold – muted as it is – catches your eye. I have to hand it to Audi here because, in the month that I’ve had it, there have been so many who have come up and asked me about the car, most starting with the colour, of course. As is the norm, the touchscreens are a pain to use, but the media knob is a saviour. Then, it’s the insides they like. The fit and finish are good, and the dark brown seats in our car lend the cabin a nice, rich look. There was high praise from a Defender owner, too; however, he was quick to notice the lack of certain equipment, such as ventilated or massage seats and a powered steering wheel adjust. These are odd misses for an otherwise well-specced car that has soft-close doors, a Bang \u0026 Olufsen sound system, four-zone climate control, a panoramic sunroof, and sliding rear seats. There are also the twin touchscreens, which I am not a fan of. Oddly enough, they started flickering on two separate occasions when answering calls on the car’s native operating system. It has not shown up since. Another oddity with the system is the radio tuner. The UI is not intuitive at all, and there’s no way to see the frequency during a scan. As a result, it’s easier to use voice commands to select a frequency. Tuning the radio is frustrating – controls are buried deep, and there’s no frequency readout. While there’s no third row, the second row slides back and forth, allowing us to fit a large-framed map flat on the boot floor. The rear seats split 40:20:40 (instead of 60:40), so I could carry a long, flat-packed Ikea bookcase despite four of us in the car. Delivering party supplies for one of my wife’s events was also easy enough, and the Q8 swallowed about 40 or so backpacks and all the party supplies. We also took the car to Goa for a short vacation – this time without our kids – so we had less to carry, and the 605-litre boot was more than enough for our two suitcases and laptop bags. The boot lid does taper, but at 605 litres, it can manage a lot. The drive to Goa proved to be redemption for the Q8’s 3.0-litre V6 turbo-petrol engine. It makes 340hp and 500Nm, and power is channelled to all four wheels via Audi’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system. I remember describing the performance as ‘more than adequate’ when I first reviewed the car in South Africa, but South Mumbai is another story. It feels very lethargic in constant start-stop traffic, and that, along with its size, makes it feel ponderous. A dedicated slot keeps the key fob safe and handy, and it feels nice to use. Getting out onto open roads then was a relief and a reminder of how nice the engine can be. Pop the car into Dynamic mode, and it’s sprightly enough. Overtaking is easy, and with the engine kept in a lower gear (higher revs), there isn’t that pause for a kickdown every time you need to get by. Even when you extend the engine, refinement is good, and you get a nice, sporty note. The trip to Goa was also redemption – only relatively speaking – for the TFSI engine’s drinking habits. Getting it past 5kpl in town is a challenge, and I managed it only once. Out on the two highway runs, though, we managed 9.3kpl (Mumbai to Goa) and 10.1kpl (Goa to Mumbai), measured tankful to tankful. You have to bear in mind that while these figures are poor in absolute terms, they are par for the course for petrol SUVs in this class. The glove box is small and not cooled, so no chilled drinks on long drives. It has been a busy first month for the Q8 in our fleet: lots of in-city running carrying cargo of various shapes and sizes, and a trip to Goa, too. What’s next? I’m sure it’s going to be a trip to Mahabaleshwar with Hormazd soon. Stay tuned for that ‘Maha’ test.

To this point, we were all silently asking ourselves what we’d gotten ourselves into. It had been two days and when we took our helmets off, I could see it on Greg’s face and in Mike’s blank stare. I could hear it in my team’s whispering of doubts back in NH. Here’s what I learned most from traveling 10,000 miles into the American West over 37 days: I didn’t really know what I was doing. After packing away our sleeping bags, we rolled through an unfamiliar town and found just the spot to shape what I would come to know most about this trip.…",

    "description": "DS Penske’s Max Guenther and Nissan’s Oliver Rowland emerged as the big winners of the Jeddah E-Prix. Formula E headed to a brand new venue for Rounds 3 and 4, racing at a shortened 3km layout of the Jeddah Corniche Circuit, which also hosts F1. Round 3 also saw the debut of Formula E’s new Pit Boost fast charging stop, which resulted in two very different races over the weekend. Indian team Mahindra Racing leaves Jeddah with a strong point haul, completing both races in the top 10. Guenther won Round 3, ahead of Rowland and Barnard Rowland won Round 4, ahead of Barnard and Hughes Mahindra sixth in the standings Pit Boost debuts at Jeddah After several delays, Formula E’s new Pit Boost finally made its race debut at the first Jeddah E-Prix. All drivers were required to pit for a 10 percent battery recharge via a 600kW fast charger, with the whole pit stop lasting a little over 30 seconds. Combined with the existing Attack Mode (which gives drivers a brief power boost and unlocks all-wheel drive), this added yet another strategic element. As expected, Pit Boost did shake up the field, with early leader Guenther falling down the order, while Mahindra’s two drivers – Nyck de Vries and Edoardo Mortara – leap-frogged their nearest rivals. “I think it’s exciting; it makes the races a little bit more like Gen2. So, less peloton-style racing; the race is much quicker; people are not as incentivised to just slow down and make sure they bank enough energy to be flat at the end,” said de Vries. “I think it was positive. There is a lot still to learn in terms of timing and the way you exit out of the pitlane. On our side, did have the quickest (pit stop) on the grid, but I [was released] into P2 and basically spent eight laps alone, which hurt my energy a little bit.” Guenther wins Jeddah E-Prix, Round 3 Starting from pole position, Guenther fell back after Pit Boost and the first round of Attack Mode. Rowland took the lead; however, he did have less usable energy than Guenther. This set the stage for a last-lap duel, with Guenther reeling Rowland in. The DS Penske driver pulled off a move at the final chicane, as Rowland struggled to hold on with whatever little energy he had left. McLaren’s Taylor Barnard crossed the line in third place to complete the podium. “It wasn’t an easy race, but we fought back to take the victory. And we did it in style – with pole position, the win, and the fastest lap. That makes me really proud,” rejoiced Guenther. Rowland wins Jeddah E-Prix, Round 4 For the second race, 20-year-old Barnard made history as Formula E’s youngest-ever polesitter. He held on to the lead for a bit, but ultimately the race was a masterclass from Rowland. The Nissan driver carefully calculated his Attack Mode deployment and managed the gap to those behind him, all while also conserving more energy than his rivals. He crossed the line to take victory with a hefty margin of 5.844 sec. With his key championship rivals Guenther and Antonio Felix da Costa out of the race, Rowland further extended his lead in the standings. “At times it was getting a bit aggressive in the pack, so I chose those moments to get to the front and stay out of trouble. Our strategy with Attack Mode was perfect, and it ensured I was able to extend a gap at the front for a smooth finish,” he said. Barnard fought off a late attack from Maserati’s Jake Hughes to finish second and make it a double podium finish over the weekend. With this, he also jumps to second place in the championship, 17 points behind Rowland. Mahindra continues points-scoring run Mahindra further cemented its return to being a consistent points scorer, collecting a total of 19 points at Jeddah. Both de Vries and Mortara finished in the top 10 in the first race. De Vries took the chequered flag in a strong P4, 1.4 sec behind race winner Guenther. Mortara had to start from the back of the grid after encountering a technical issue in qualifying. But he made up for it in the race, gaining 15 places to finish P7. The second Jeddah E-Prix was a lot tougher for Mahindra. Despite having a strong starting position of P5 on the grid, Mortara was held up at the Turn 4 hairpin with two other competitors making contact. This dropped him to the tail end, but he recovered to finish P10 and score an additional point for the team. De Vries crossed the line P13. \"If we put the entire weekend in perspective, it's another sure sign that we have made some steps forward in performance, and everybody was satisfied to score a big haul of points for the team on Friday,” said Mahindra Racing CEO and Team Principal Frederic Bertrand. “Saturday was not exactly the race that we wanted. Edo was unfortunate to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and that compromised his entire evening, and with Nyck, we need to analyse and take the learnings from tonight.” The Indian team currently stands sixth in the teams’ championship, just two points behind Maserati. After a lengthy eight-week break, the 2025 Formula E season will resume with the Miami E-Prix on April 12.

    "title": "Evolution of an Icon: The MZR 240z",
    "link": "",
    "description": "﻿ The Datsun 240Z was never the problem. It was the solution. The answer to a world where European sports cars carried steep price tags and Japanese cars were still thought of as nothing more than basic transportation. For years, Japanese cars in America were what students drove to class, what families bought when they were new, when money was tight, or what commuters relied on when fuel prices spiked. They were appliances, used for economy, and durability. It’s easy to look back on them now as more than products of their time. But they weren’t. They filled parking lots at office buildings and grocery stores, racked up hundreds of thousands of miles on city roads, and lived out their lives as forgettable hand-me-downs, passed from one generation to the next until they rusted into the ground. They were not the cars enthusiasts dreamed about, not the machines people pinned on their walls or took out on Sunday after church for a little exercise. Today we love the quirky, endearing nature of the classic Japanese econobox, but back then? It was a tool.  The Z was one of the cars that changed everything. It was Japan’s bold declaration, a machine shaped by the same relentless craftsmanship and discipline that defined the country’s post-war industrial rise. It embodied the Japanese philosophy of kaizen, continuous improvement.  The Z was beautiful, with the long nose of a Ferrari, and an inline-six that, despite its modest origins (and with some SU carburetors installed), could sing when you need it to. In 1970, it was fast enough, with a chassis that felt nimble, eager, and alive in a way most Americans had never experienced in something that did not wear a European badge. It was still affordable, but it was no longer just transportation. It was undeniably a sports car. But time does not stand still. Roads get wider. And for better or worse, cars get faster, stop better, turn sharper, and expectations shift. The Z’s magic is still there, but modern traffic, modern brakes, and modern speed put it in a different context. It still thrives on momentum and chassis respect. But, time marches on. The engineers at Nissan did not create the perfect Z, they created the best one they could for the money, theirs, and yours. So, as is often the case as we make engine noises in our garage over winter, pontificating on what we can modify, and how things could be better. The question is not whether the Z is still great as it was, it is how much better could it be? For Rahail Tariq, the Z had been lurking in his subconscious, a shape that had stuck with him from flipping through magazine pages. When he finally got his first 240Z, his first classic car, it was white, with black sills and a set of 260Z wheels that he did not even know were incorrect at the time. He bought it online in 2005, not as an expert but as someone drawn to its presence, and it’s silhouette. That car, with all its patina and imperfections, was the seed that eventually grew into MZR Roadsports.   Rahail’s connection to cars ran deeper than just his own discoveries. His father, a technician in the 1970s, was always bringing home interesting machinery, M5s, Mini Coopers, Daimlers, even an E-Type Jaguar. Growing up around those cars, seeing the way his father worked on them, improved them, and understood them, gave him an appreciation for cars as something alive, something that could always be made better. The Z was just the first car where Rahail realized that he was the one who would have to push it forward. In the UK, where classic Japanese sports cars did not have the same deep-rooted restoration culture as Porsches or E-Types, Rahail found himself frustrated. Nobody was building the Z the way he envisioned it. No one was taking it to its logical next step, not just restoring but refining, improving. That search led him to Martin Ryland, a Datsun expert who eventually became his collaborator and helped shape the vision of MZR. Restomods are sometimes frowned upon, seen as tampering with an icon, but consider this. Given the opportunity, is it possible Nissan would have never left the Z as it was? If the company had continued refining it with an unlimited budget, what would it have looked like? A lighter chassis, a more rigid structure, and an engine with sharper response and a little more urgency. That is exactly what MZR is doing, finishing what the original engineers, given enough time, could have done, maybe even would have done, but did not. Their Evolution models, built with bespoke carbon-fiber bodywork, are not just about chasing numbers. Yes, the RB 3.4L DOHC straight-six delivers over 300 horsepower, and yes, the six-speed manual brings precision to every shift, but the real magic is in how it all comes together. It is a 240Z honed and distilled, shaped by the same kaizen philosophy that defined its creation, an ongoing pursuit of refinement, balance, and purpose. The 240Z never needed saving, it was never the problem after all. But it deserved to be honored, not just looked at through the lens of nostalgia. It was built to be driven, and MZR has made sure that it still begs to be. Continue...",

    "description": "It’s akin to landing a dream job you lied through your teeth to get. You walk in on day one, staring down a pile of responsibilities you aren’t remotely qualified for. The job? Managing a car with a 1.5-liter turbo engine running around 2 bar of boost mounted where the groceries used to go. No airbag, no abs, no training wheels. Just figure it out before you get fired or, in this case, sent backward through a guardrail. Your new boss, (who ignores OSHA and HR) the Renault R5 Maxi Turbo, expects results.  Juan Carlos Fernandez knows what it’s like to start from nothing. In 1963, his family fled Cuba with an infant Juan in tow, leaving behind their home, their belongings, everything they had ever known. They landed in Puerto Rico with no roadmap, just the need to survive. His parents worked tirelessly to rebuild, instilling in him the kind of work ethic that doesn’t ask for shortcuts. By the time he was a teenager, cars had his full attention. His cousins were in the auto business, and he scraped together whatever he could to buy his first car, a $200 project. One car turned into two. Two turned into three. The hustle never stopped. If he needed more money, he worked harder. Decades later, that drive turned into Ferco Motors, the dealership he owns today.  A friend once told him the R5 was “so ugly it’s beautiful,” but to Juan, it was just beautiful. It had character, presence, and the kind of raw, unfiltered driving experience that modern cars have lost. It wasn’t built for straight-line speed or effortless performance, it was built to be driven hard, to demand something from the driver. And that’s exactly what drew him to it. The R5 is a product of Renault’s obsession with Group B, the golden era of rally racing where manufacturers built the most extreme machines they could get away with. The FIA required manufacturers to build a limited number of road-going versions to compete, and Renault’s answer was to take their humble economy hatch and reimagine it into something wild. At risk of boiling things down, and for the sake of brevity we’ll just say the engine was moved to the back, the body was widened, and the power was turned up The result was the R5 Turbo. That car made its competition debut in 1980 at the Tour de Corse, a rally known for its tight, twisting tarmac stages. French driver Jean Ragnotti piloted the car and, despite being up against much more developed machines, showed its potential. The real breakthrough came the following year when Ragnotti drove the R5 Turbo to an outright victory at the 1981 Monte Carlo Rally. It was undoubtedly good, but... was more possible?       Enter the R5 Maxi Turbo, the ultimate version, the final boss. It was built to compete with the Audi Quattro and the Peugeot 205 T16. Definitely a tough crowd. Renault brought in Bozian Racing, a French motorsport engineering firm known for squeezing every last drop of performance out of small-displacement engines. In this case they pulled 350 horsepower out of Renaults 1.5L engine. They made the car stiffer, and increased the work aerodynamics were doing.  It had some success in competition, and proved its mettle on tarmac, but as all-wheel-drive rivals took over, its time on the dirt and in the spotlight, faded.  Juan’s R5 wasn’t perfect when he bought it. It had been sitting, neglected, and the first drive was a disappointment. No boost, a failing clutch, just a reminder that even the greats need work, and time spares no one, and no thing. But with the right expertise, the right people, and a lot of effort, it came back to life, a worthy tribute to the Group B legend.  Juan Carlos Fernandez didn’t get here by taking the easy way. He came from nothing, worked for everything, and never asked for a shortcut. The R5 doesn’t give one either. It just wants you to show up for work. Continue...",
