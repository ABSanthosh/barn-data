    "description": "When the Harley-Davidson Pan America first broke cover, we knew it would shake up the adventure bike market. What we didn’t expect, was that it would become a regular fixture on the custom motorcycle scene. The Dutch workshop Powerbrick was one of the first to show the Pan America’s potential, by turning it into an unapologetic streetfighter with razor-sharp styling. That bike sent our servers into overdrive, earning it the top spot on our annual Top 10 list. But, as shop boss Tim Somers explained at the time, it was never meant to be a one-off. Powerbrick’s first Pan America kicked off the development of a range of plug-and-play parts, under their CNCPT Moto label. After much refinement, those parts are now ready to go—so Tim and his crew have built a pair of jaw-dropping Pan Americas to showcase them.…",

    "description": "I was less than enthusiastic when Harley-Davidson finally released the Street 500, one of their two newest middleweight models meant to break into the beginner and intermediate markets. I was hoping they might divert a little more radically from their signature cruiser look, but the Street 500 felt like a less inspired, smaller-displacement, fuel-injected, liquid-cooled vanilla version of an 883 to me. Then, as if Harley had tuned into my gripes, I learned of their plans to bring flat track racing to the masses with intentions of adding the event to the X Games and using the new Street 750 as the platform. At the same time, The Speed Merchant dropped us a line from California to say they were building a tracker-inspired Harley Street 500 to be unveiled at Born Free 6.…",

    "description": "The Reise name is quite nascent in the Indian biking community. Initially known for their tyres, particularly off-road-centric ones, the brand later forayed into the motorcycle gear space by retailing products from other manufacturers. Now, Reise has launched their own line, and when they offered to provide us with jackets for review, I was particularly pleased to get my hands on the Reise PineAir jacket. After using it for over three months, here’s what I’ve gathered. The front pockets are waterproof and keep items safe during unexpected showers. At a glance, it’s a smart-looking jacket, no doubt. The beige colour certainly has its own appeal in a world dominated by darker riding gear. It features Velcro adjustments on the arms and back to ensure a snug fit. The front pockets, mind you, are waterproof, and after being caught in a few unexpected showers, I can personally vouch for that claim. The PineAir comes with a comprehensive protection package, by which I mean it features CE Level 2-certified armour for the elbows, shoulders, back and chest. A low-speed fall on a broken concrete road gave me the chance to ‘test’ the elbow armour. I’m happy to report that the armour absorbed all the impact, leaving my hand injury-free, save for a minor bruise from the armour. Could’ve been worse. The jacket material did pick up a few abrasions in the accident, but it was a worthy sacrifice, and the jacket is still perfectly usable.  Frequently touched areas are prone to collecting dirt on this beige colour jacket.  Now, we’re based in Mumbai, and this year, temperatures consistently hovered around the 35-degC mark (felt more like 40 due to the humidity). I must say, at a standstill, the heat does build up significantly; traffic stops made me feel like a potato wrapped in aluminium foil roasting over an open fire. However, once I got moving, the airflow improved considerably. Of course, the Reise PineAir is primarily a touring jacket, and that shows on the highway, where the ventilation works best, something the swarming traffic of Mumbai isn’t quite representative of. On the topic of it being a touring jacket, there is a bit of heft to it, and its 2.2kg weight does become cumbersome during city runs.  Cordura enhances protection along with the CE Level 2-certified armour. Remember that beautiful sand colour I liked so much? Well, over time, I also learned that it’s quite prone to collecting dirt, especially on frequently touched areas like the pockets, wrist cuffs and collar. While a wash does clean it up, it’s something to keep in mind, as it can leave a visible mark without much effort, but fortunately, there is also a stealthy black colour available.   The PineAir offers solid protection, ample storage and stylish looks, and at a price of Rs 10,000, this is a good alternative to other Indian-made jackets at a similar price.

    "description": "Hero MotoCorp has recently faced turbulence in its sales numbers and market share. Part of the problem is that its overarching success lies in the 100-110cc commuter bike category, which has seen a declining trend in recent years. The other part is that none of its more recent, premium products – except for the Xtreme 125R – have set the sales charts on fire. The company is seeking to replicate that sort of success in the premium 125cc scooter segment as well, and the all-new Destini 125 is its first tool at chipping into that space. So, can this revamped Destini 125 help Hero on its journey towards a more premium identity? Hero Destini 125 design and features - 7/10 Has the basics covered but is lacking in some crucial areas The Destini 125 has a typical family scooter look (for the most part), with pleasing lines and a safe design. This holds true when you see the scooter from the front, but as your eyes snake their way to the back, you’ll notice that Hero has gone down an unconventional route when it comes to the tail-lamp and rear indicators. The tail-lamp is shaped like the letter H – an increasingly common signature across Hero products – and the turn signals are stacked on top of it. While there is no functional problem, this is a polarising design choice in a segment dominated by inoffensive designs.  Hero Destini 125 key specificationsHero Destini 125Kerb Weight115kgSeat Height770mmGround Clearance162mmFuel Tank capacity5.3 litresWheelbase1302mm A concealed fuel filler cap is an improvement, but the space to get your fingers around the cap is a little tight. Fit and finish is one area where Hero still has some ways to go. The indicator and horn buttons feel quite plasticky, the cover for the USB charging port feels flimsy, and the fuel filler lid’s panel doesn’t sit flush on the left side. Speaking of the fuel filler, the empty space around the lid is a little tight for those with larger hands, and tightening the cap once you’ve refuelled takes a little dexterity.  Lack of a brake lock clasp is a crucial miss on a gearless scooter; parking on a slope will necessitate some caution. It also misses out on a brake lock clasp, which is a must-have on a gearless scooter. The mirrors, while well-shaped, have rather short stalks, which means a quarter of your rear view is obstructed by your elbow. Another area where the Destini lags behind its rivals is storage capacity. While it has the basics covered, with a luggage hook on the front apron and a spacious cubby that can fit a 1-litre water bottle, its 19-litre underseat storage area is quite small. This is especially true in comparison to the TVS Jupiter models, which offer class-leading levels of boot space in the ICE scooter game.  A boot light is a nice feature to have, but the 19-litre underseat storage area is one of the smallest in this class. That’s not to say it’s devoid of features, and in addition to a side-stand cutoff, auto-cancelling indicators, a boot light, and a USB charger, you also have the option to pair your smartphone with the display. Once paired, you can receive turn-by-turn navigation prompts, as well as call and SMS alerts. While all of this is nice to have, the display has its oddities. For instance, the odometer and clock are hard to tell apart at a quick glance, and, on a sunny day, even at full brightness, the smaller digits on the screen are hard to make out. The digital LCD screen has some good features like turn-by-turn navigation, although it could be a little brighter. Hero Destini 125 ride and handling - 8/10 Overall comfort levels are quite high; it is a predictable handler One area where the Destini is a rather accomplished machine is in its ride comfort. The generously padded seat, spacious ergonomics, and plush suspension setup work together to make the Destini one of the most comfortable scooters around. We recently tested the newest Suzuki Access and TVS Jupiter 110, so with that fresh in our minds, we can report back that the suspension and seat comfort on the Destini feel superior to those of the aforementioned scooters.   Hero Destini 125 underpinningsHero Destini 125Suspension (F/R)Telescopic fork / MonoshockBrakes (F/R)Disc / DrumTyres (F/R)90/90-12 / 100/80-12 The suspension absorbs most of what comes in the way very well and is among the best in this segment. With 12-inch wheels at both ends, the Destini is a sure-footed machine even at higher speeds, and the larger rear wheel also helps to some extent when going over bigger bumps. Being a family scooter, the Destini makes no pretences of being an energetic handler, and it prioritises stability over flickability.  Stopping performance is commensurate with rivals and the CBS works well, but the brakes are devoid of feel. As with other offerings in the class, the Destini gets combi-brakes, and while there is sufficient stopping power to be had, the brakes felt devoid of feel and always necessitated a firm pull when coming to a halt. Hero Destini 125 performance and fuel economy - 7/10 Fuel efficiency and performance are commendable, but refinement could improve At the first ride event last year, Hero told us that while the latest Destini uses the same engine block as the previous-gen model, the company had gone to great lengths to improve refinement, mileage, and reliability over a longer duration. While it has succeeded in some areas, there’s still some work to be done.  Hero Destini 125 performanceAcceleration0-40kph3.8s0-80kph16.07sRoll-on acceleration20-50kph4.97s30-70kph10.86s50-80kph10.62sBraking 60-0kph (in metres)18.53m We’ll begin with the positives. The Destini’s motor is quite punchy, and if you want to make a quick overtake in city traffic, a small to moderate throttle opening will get the job done. If your commute includes fast, flowing roads – like in Indian metro cities – the Destini can hold a 70kph cruise as well.  The 124.6cc engine is decently punchy and rather efficient, but its refinement levels could be better. Fuel economy is a big factor when purchasing a vehicle like this, and the Destini ticks that box nicely. In our tests, the scooter managed to deliver 58kpl (overall), which is quite close to Hero’s claim of 60kpl. A couple of factors are at play here. First, the engine’s punchy nature means you don’t need to wring its neck when making progress, thereby reducing wide-open throttle openings and aiding fuel economy. Second, Hero’s i3s start/stop tech cuts the engine off when you’re idling at a stoplight and helps save fuel.  With its wide and generously padded seat, plush suspension setup and neutral ergos, the Destini is one of the most comfortable scooters in its class. While the i3s system undoubtedly aids fuel efficiency, its execution has left us wanting. The procedure to restart the engine is to keep either brake lever pressed and hold the accelerator open until the engine turns over. All of this takes about 2-3 seconds, which may not sound like a lot, but after experiencing Suzuki and Yamaha’s seamless start/stop systems, Hero’s i3s feels slow-witted and cumbersome in impatient big-city traffic. Then there is also the fact that the Destini’s engine is considerably behind our refinement benchmark – the Suzuki Access – with a mild buzz felt at the handlebar and floorboard at various speeds.  Mirrors are well-shaped and smooth throughout, but the stalks are a little short; elbow obstructs the rear view. What was a more troubling issue was that our scooter’s engine started making a metallic rattling sound a few days into its 2-week stint with us. This occurrence would present itself when accelerating with a wide-open throttle from a standstill or from speeds under 20kph, and it would continue for a few seconds. This noise didn’t affect the performance of the scooter at all, but it was disconcerting nonetheless, especially on a vehicle that had barely crossed the 8,000km mark. We have reached out to Hero and will update the web version of this story once we discover what the issue was. Hero Destini 125 price and verdict - 7/10 It is now a better scooter, but still some distance away from the best in class In our time with it, we’ve discovered that the Destini 125 has strengths and weaknesses that are common across most Hero products. It is exceptionally comfortable, rather frugal, and backed by the company’s extensive retail sales network. At the same time, weaknesses such as fit and finish that leaves you wanting, and a lacklustre engine sour this package, especially now that the 125cc scooter class has some seriously impressive competitors.  The i3s start-stop system could be quicker in its operation. Ranging between Rs 81,850 and Rs 91,700 (ex-showroom, Delhi), it is priced on par with its rivals and doesn’t have the upper hand there either. Comfort and frugality are two big factors people look for in a scooter, and the Destini has those areas covered, but its shortcomings are enough to prevent it from rising to the top of the class.

    "description": "The Skoda Slavia, in its Monte Carlo trim, has really been turning heads. Not because it’s new, but I guess in a jam full of SUVs, a sedan wearing bright red is quite the attention-grabber. Walking up to it makes me happy the moment I see it parked there, knowing that the 1.5 TSI engine will be a delight to drive. Oh, and on a side note, I just realised ‘jam’ would be an apt collective noun for a group of cars. The storage space under the front armrest is nice and deep. So far, I’ve used the Slavia only within the city, but with summer vacations on and traffic appreciably lighter, I’ve actually been able to enjoy clear roads, steady cruising, and decent fuel efficiency, too. I’ve managed an overall figure of about 8.5kpl over this past month – not bad for a petrol automatic in Mumbai, and I haven’t been driving with efficiency in mind. You can only have a dial display of the speedo or tacho, not both together. Rather, it’s been tempting to enjoy the 150hp and 250Nm of torque, which makes it responsive off the line and also allows you to take advantage of empty stretches of tarmac. It’s amazing how quickly you’ll be nudging the 70kph speed limit around town. Beyond outright speed, though, it’s the crisp nature of its power delivery that you will enjoy every time you dab the throttle, so don’t think of this as something you can only enjoy out on highways. Have to say, though, at very low speeds, it sometimes trips up between 1st and 2nd gear, typical of so many DSGs. Indented shelf cubby neatly creates two separate handy storage spaces. Another bit that annoys me – even though it’s a far smaller issue – is the instrument display. It’s customisable and has dials, but you can only call up a speedo or a tacho dial, not both at the same time. And while I’m on about stuff I don’t like, let’s talk air conditioning. The VW Group’s India 2.0 cars were known to have subpar ACs, and while this one is just about holding up against the summer, every now and then, you will need to tweak the temperature or fan speed, and those touch controls are fiddly to use. The indentation does help, but it’s hard to get a precise change in temperature or fan speed, and you need to look down to confirm just how much has changed. Console slot should have been deeper to easily store the key fob. Such a contrast to the steering-mounted audio controls. The track selection buttons fall into hand easily, and the volume scroll wheel is simply a delight to use: quick, easy, and with a nice tactile feel as well. It’s a familiar Skoda, and it’s nice to see these on the India 2.0 cars too. Speaking of familiar Skoda traits, there’s a ‘simply clever’ bit I really like and put to use every day; the centre console cubby has an indented shelf design that creates two spaces within and neatly holds my phone on the wireless charging mat and my wallet in the space ahead. And while I’m on about storage, the boot is pretty handy, too, at 521 litres. That’s around what some SUVs offer. So, if plans materialise, I’ll be off to Goa soon, and after a raft of SUVs, I think it’s this sedan I’ll take this time around.

    "description": "The compact SUV segment continues to grow, and the latest entrant in this tightly contested space is the Skoda Kylaq. It offers everything we liked about the Skoda Kushaq in a smaller and more affordable package, so the question is: how does it stack up against the winner of our last compact SUV comparison, the Mahindra XUV 3XO? Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO exterior design and engineering Kylaq looks proportionate and mature, while the 3XO is distinctive. Let’s start with the way they look. Both models measure just under 4m in length, but the Kylaq looks more proportionate. The wide signature front grille, split headlamps and chunky bumper work well to give the Skoda a good presence. Around the side, the 17-inch alloys, chunky cladding and roof rails add some flavour, while the faux scuff plate at the back gives it an outdoorsy look. However, the small square tail-lights make it appear more like a hatchback rather than a crossover. XUV 3XO styling may not appeal to everyone In comparison, the 3XO’s tail looks abruptly cut off, as it’s based on the 4m+ Ssangyong Tivoli. Like newer Mahindras, the 3XO has a polarising design, to say the least. Vertically oriented headlights, C-shaped daytime running lamps and a sharply cut bumper lend the 3XO its distinctive face. Like the Skoda, the Mahindra also gets 17-inch rims, body cladding and roof rails to further its SUV look. The rear is characterised by a full-width LED light bar and a chunky bumper.

The XUV also has the advantage of 201mm ground clearance; the Kylaq’s is 189mm. However, the Skoda does have an edge when it comes to boot space, measuring 360 litres up to the parcel shelf, while the Mahindra has a 295-litre capacity. Both can also be expanded further thanks to split-folding rear seats, though the Skoda has a deeper boot. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO interior space and comfort Kylaq interior is built tough, but all-black scheme detract from sense of space All-black theme with green trim gives Kylaq cabin a sporty vibe; quality is solid. These two also take a different approach on the inside. The Kylaq, as expected, closely resembles the Kushaq, with shared elements like the high-quality, 2-spoke steering wheel, digital instrument cluster and touch-based panel for climate control. However, Skoda has added some flash value by giving it olive green inserts on the dashboard, door panels and centre console, along with a light-textured fascia. Overall, the design is clean and uncluttered and has a solid build, which is only furthered by the reassuring ‘thud’ you get when closing the doors. It has a dual-tone theme, but the black upholstery can make you feel hemmed in, especially when compared to the XUV. It has a practical interior, too, with large doorbins, plenty of cubbies, and some typically Skoda ‘Simply Clever’ touches like the phone slots on the front seatbacks, a ticket holder on the windshield, and more. Headroom and kneeroom are decent, but it’s only wide enough for two. The Kylaq’s front seats are better in this company, given that they offer better support and feature electric adjustment and ventilation. But in terms of the backseat, it falls behind the Mahindra. It has an adequate amount of legroom and headroom for average-sized adults, but the narrow cabin and the seat contouring mean it is best suited for two passengers. Rear occupants get their own AC vents, Type-C charging ports, adjustable headrests and a centre armrest with cupholders. XUV 3XO cabin feels airier and more premium Looks and feels more premium, thanks to soft-touch materials and light upholstery. In comparison, the XUV 3XO’s interior looks and feels more upmarket. The light-coloured upholstery uplifts the space, as does the panoramic sunroof, but the ivory seats will be challenging to keep clean. Top-spec versions get a soft-touch finish on the dash; there’s a generous use of gloss black, and elements like the steering wheel, window switches and light/wiper stalks feel top-notch. It’s also nice that the XUV gets physical buttons and knobs for the dual-zone climate control. Like the Kylaq, the 3XO has plenty of storage spaces in the cabin, with large doorbins, a good-sized cooled glove box, and more. XUV 3XO's rear seat has more room and can comfortably fit three adults. You’ll appreciate the view you get out of the cabin from the XUV, and the bonnet flares give you the feeling that you’re driving an SUV. The front seats, even though they’re well-cushioned, aren’t as accommodating as the Kylaq’s, and you’ll also miss that you don’t get electric adjustment or ventilation. But it’s at the rear where the Mahindra has the most evident advantage. Owing to its width, three adults can sit comfortably in the XUV, and the long wheelbase means that legroom is plenty, too. If anything, accommodating the mechanism for the sunroof has eaten into headroom, but that’ll only be an issue for those taller than 6 feet. Amenities at the back include AC vents, a centre armrest with cupholders, a 12V port and a USB Type-C charger.

Commendably, both the Kylaq and XUV 3XO have a 5-star BNCAP rating. However, they both have features unique to them as well. Kylaq one-ups XUV 3XO with powered and ventilated front seats Ventilated front seats unique to the Kylaq. The Kylaq’s front seats have ventilation and power adjustment, which the XUV lacks, and we found the output from the Skoda’s 4-speaker and 2-tweeter audio system to be more consistent. The Skoda makes do with smaller 10-inch and 8-inch screens for the infotainment and cluster, respectively. However, its screen features a newer UI compared to its stablemates, and on the whole, this system is slick and has good graphics. XUV 3XO gets Level 2 ADAS, 360-degree camera, rear disc brakes, and more 3XO’s panoramic sunroof will be a big draw. Coming to the XUV 3XO, the AX7 L featured here gets a larger panoramic sunroof, larger 10.25-inch screens, an electronic parking brake, a 360-degree camera, more connected tech, a 7-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, rear disc brakes, and Level 2 ADAS (blind-spot monitor, autonomous emergency braking, lane-keep assist, and more) over the Kylaq’s range-topping Prestige variant. The ADAS features work well on a clearly marked road and can be switched off completely, too, should you want to. I found the blind-spot monitor, which appears in the instrument cluster, to be particularly useful.

The Kylaq has a smaller 1.0-litre unit that puts out 115hp and 178Nm, while the 3XO’s larger 1.2-litre motor produces 131hp and 230Nm. Both versions tested were paired with the same Aisin-sourced 6-speed torque converter automatic gearbox. 131hp 1.2L mill feels strong throughout rev range. Given the difference in output, the Mahindra is naturally quicker in a sprint to 100kph, completing it in 11.05sec to the Kylaq’s 11.69sec. The Skoda claws back in the 20-80kph run, posting an identical time of 6.38sec, but it is marginally slower in the 40-100kph run. Skoda 1.0 TSI feels stronger than expected 115hp 1.0 TSI engine punches above its weight. The Kylaq’s engine is slightly slower to respond at low speeds, and that’s something you’ll have to get used to in city driving. But then on, power delivery becomes smooth and progress easy. The TSI engine punches above its weight and feels significantly stronger than its cubic capacity would have you believe. And that’s most evident in the mid-range. What helps make the most of the mid-range are the paddle shifters, which add to the engagement. And even in fully automatic mode, the gearbox does its job rather smoothly. In isolation, the Kylaq’s engine is refined, but it is the noisier unit in comparison. XUV 3XO feels punchier at low speeds The XUV 3XO has a significant power and torque advantage, and you feel as much from the get-go. Drive modes also help fine-tune the experience. Just as you start out, you’ll feel that the XUV 3XO is more responsive at low speeds. However, you have to be mindful – at least in city driving conditions – that it’s better in Zip mode, where power delivery is the smoothest. If you’re in Zap or Zoom mode, you will find that the engine bunches up its power quite early in the rev range. And you don’t want that when you’re in very tight moving conditions. Modes alter response and steering weight. Of course, when the road opens up, you’d want to switch to Zap or Zoom mode, which will have the engine breathe freer and feel different in its power delivery. While the Kylaq’s engine is the strongest in the mid-range, the XUV’s mill feels strong throughout. So, right from low revs, it’s more alert and responsive, and even in the mid-range, there is a constant and steady stream of power. You don’t have to work the engine to get the best out of it. Paddle shifters add to the Kylaq's drive experience. The 3XO is quick and fun, but you will miss paddle shifters. Gear shifts via the lever are responsive enough, though. What’s remarkable is the Mahindra engine’s refinement. Even when revved hard, it doesn’t thrum like you’d expect a 3-cylinder unit to. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO fuel efficiency XUV 3XO was more frugal in our testing Kylaq returned a better mileage on the highway, while the XUV 3XO sipped less fuel in the city. Coming to the important topic of fuel efficiency, we put the two cars through our test loops in Mumbai city as well as on the highway. And it’s the XUV that delivered a higher figure of 9.9kpl in town. The SUV’s auto stop/start keeps the engine off for longer durations, which could have helped the economy. The Kylaq managed 8.7kpl in the city, but it did edge past on the highway, delivering 13.3kpl to the XUV 3XO’s 13kpl figure. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO fuel efficiencyFuel efficiencyKylaqXUV 3XOCity (kpl)8.709.89Highway (kpl)13.3613.01 Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO ride comfort and handling Kylaq corners better, but XUV 3XO feels more stable at high speeds Around the bends, the Kylaq feels more engaging. The Kylaq doesn’t get steering modes like the XUV 3XO, and in general, it has a lighter steering wheel, but it’s nice and smooth, and you can have great fun in the corners. You also get the feeling that this chassis could actually take on a larger, more powerful engine, maybe the 1.5 TSI for a Kylaq RS? When cruising on the highway, the Kylaq drives like a bigger car, but over undulations, there is more up-and-down movement than you get in the 3XO. And if you talk specifically in comparison to the 3XO’s ride comfort, the Kylaq is more absorbent at lower speeds, and over bumps and potholes, you’ll sense that there’s a bit more wheel travel as well. XUV 3XO's driving modes noticeably affect steering feel. The XUV 3XO, too, feels fun to drive on a twisty road. Notably, its drive modes also change steering weight progressively. You get a good feeling of control at the steering wheel, but the standout element is the grip that you experience around corners. So, you can carry a lot of speed with a great deal of confidence. At higher speeds, the 3XO feels poised and composed, and you can attribute that to the relatively flatter ride than the Kylaq. On the flip side, the low-speed ride is a bit firmer than the Skoda, but not to the extent of being a dealbreaker. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO price and verdict Both compact SUVs trade blows on the price front They're close in terms of driving experience, but the Mahindra feels like a more complete package. In terms of pricing, the Skoda Kylaq and Mahindra XUV 3XO are about at par for comparable trim levels. The fully loaded XUV 3XO AX7 L featured here is pricey at Rs 15.79 lakh (ex-showroom, Mumbai). But forgo the ADAS, 360-degree camera and electric parking brake, and you can get the AX7, whose Rs 13.99 lakh price tag is identical to that of the top-spec Kylaq Prestige AT. Talking about like-priced variants, there is a bit of give and take in features, but they’re still close. The duo is also close in terms of driving experience, the 3XO being marginally faster, while the Kylaq is more entertaining in its handling and slightly more absorbent in its ride quality. Where the 3XO moves ahead is in its plusher interior, more refined engine and more room for passengers. The advantage in fuel economy also tips the scales in favour of the Mahindra. Keen drivers will enjoy both models, no doubt, but it’s the XUV 3XO that eventually makes you feel like you’ve got more for your money.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/626bhp-range-rover-sport-sv-permanently-added-line",
    "description": "Super-SUV is offered in either 'standard' SV form or more hardcore - and quicker - SV Black edition The Range Rover Sport SV has been made a permanent member of JLR's model line-up. The super-SUV arrived in 2024 and was sold in limited numbers as part of Edition One and Edition Two batches. JLR has now added two variants to the Range Rover Sport line-up: a standard SV and a more hardcore SV Black edition. Both are powered by a BMW-derived 4.4-litre twin-turbocharged petrol V8, putting out 626bhp and 553 lb ft of torque. In the standard SV, this is good for a 0-60mph time of just 3.8sec and all the way to a limited top speed of 165mph.  The Black cuts the sprint time by 0.2sec and can continue to 180mph. That extra acceleration is down to the Black's use of carbonfibre throughout, such as the bonnet. Underneath, both versions get the same 6D Dynamics suspension technology that made its debut on the limited-run model and is now featured on the Land Rover Defender Octa. It works to improve handling and performance by effectively eliminating body roll. Both SV variants wear 23in alloy wheels and, unlike previously, can now be kitted with an array of optional extras. As per its name, the Black is painted in Narvik Black and all elements, from the brake calipers to the SV badges, are finished in Narvik Gloss Black. Inside, Ebony Windsor leather is joined by more black detailing. The SV is available to buy now, priced from £139,995. The £154,975 Black will be made available to order later this year.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/ferrari-amalfi-new-name-and-power-boost-redesigned-roma",
    "description": "Entry-level Ferrari gets 631bhp, fresh styling and brings 'accessible' pace. The new 631bhp Ferrari Amalfi has been unveiled as the firm’s new entry-level model, with more power, overhauled styling and revamped aerodynamics compared with its Roma predecessor. Its underpinnings are shared with the Roma, but Ferrari says it is an all-new model, with nearly every panel changed and the front-mounted 4.0-litre twin-turbocharged V8 extensively reworked. That reworking means the Amalfi is a more powerful proposition than the car it replaces, with an output of 631bhp – an increase of 19bhp. Torque remains at 561lb ft, and power is delivered via the same eight-speed dual-clutch transmission for a 0-62mph time of 3.3sec, 0.1sec quicker than the Roma. While those increases in power and speed seem modest, Ferrari has instead concentrated on making the engine more responsive when operating in higher gears, especially third and fourth. This is most apparent in its 0-124mph time, which now takes 9.0sec – cut by 0.6sec. Key to this increased responsiveness is a 1.3kg-lighter camshaft, which also allows for a higher engine revolution speed, the fitment of the 12Cillindri’s Bosch-made ECU, which optimises engine performance, and new ducts in the headlights to send more air to the turbochargers while also reducing drag. Yet while it possesses more power, one of the entry-level Ferrari’s key focus areas was accessibility, according to product development chief Gianmaria Fulgenzi. As a result, the Amalfi is one of the most “drivable” Ferrari’s ever made, which is important because 50% of Roma buyers had never driven a Ferrari before, according to Fulgenzi. “We wanted to create a car that was for new-to-Ferrari owners, perhaps experiencing a Ferrari for the first time,” he said. “It had to be easy to drive, not too intimidating, even with more than 600bhp. This car is designed to be accessible to everyone while still offering experienced drivers the ability to use its full potential, whether on mountain roads or highways.” To meet the accessibility brief, work was done to make the Amalfi “more predictable”. New underbody lips and a redesigned active rear wing both work to better manage air flow. With the wing in its most extreme of three positions, it adds an extra 110kg of downforce compared with the Roma. The Amalfi also has a brake-by-wire system that replaces the mechanical braking components with a computer-controlled setup that in turn translates pedal pressure into the appropriate braking force. This, said Fulgenzi, makes the car more usable “in any weather condition” and is a “huge improvement” compared with the Roma. “With this system the driver can have the same braking feeling and distance in every situation,” he added. “It is more predictable.” The changes make the Amalfi quiet, stable and safer when driven in its comfort-focused modes but also “a very high-performing car” when pushed. “We wanted to have a car that everyone can use daily,” said Fulgenzi. “When you are with your family, you want a car that is completely safe. When you are alone, you can [change the settings] to improve your engagement.” The mechanical changes are extensive, but the design refresh is more evolution than revolution. Chief designer Flavio Manzoni said the aim was to keep the Roma’s design, “but give it a modern touch”, with a focus on simplicity and purity. Ferrari says every exterior panel – bar the glasshouse – is new, and it is at the front where most of the styling changes have been made. Gone is the Roma’s sleek, pointed nose and grille, now replaced by a new design that is similar to that of the larger Purosangue SUV. “It was important for us to give a new identity to this car, which is consistent with the identity of the new Ferraris, without repeating the same elements,” said Manzoni. “But there should be a certain family feeling across the range.” In the cabin a new centre console, referred to by Ferrari as the interior “bridge”, is milled from a solid block of aluminium. It is joined by a new 10.25in central infotainment screen, which sits alongside the 15.6in digital instrument cluster and the 8.8in passenger screen. One of the biggest changes compared with the Roma is the reintroduction of physical steering wheel controls. This includes the start/stop button, which was requested by owners. Asked why the Italian car maker changed the name from Roma to Amalfi , despite it still looking similar enough that customers may refer to it as “the new Roma”, marketing boss Enrico Galliera compared it to art. “When you buy a painting, the name should be new. It deserves a new name,” he said. Deliveries of the new Ferrari Amalfi will begin in left-hand-drive markets at the start of next year, followed by right-hand-drive models soon after. Prices in Italy start at €240,000 (£204,700). The Roma Spider will stay on sale alongside the Amalfi , with a drop-top version of the new sports car expected to arrive in a few years’ time.",

Prices start at just Rs 59,490 for the base Go variant if bought on the BaaS plan and go up to Rs 1.10 lakh for the Plus model if purchased with the batteries.  Vida VX2 offered with BaaS option on both variants Go and Plus have 92km and 142km claimed range, respectively Hero claims running cost of just Rs 0.96/km for the Vida VX2 Vida VX2 price, battery and range details Vida VX2 BaaS details Hero offers the Vida VX2 in two variants - Go (2.2kWh battery) and Plus (3.4kWh battery). The claimed IDC range is 92km and 142km, for both variants respectively. The Vida VX2 can also be purchased on a Battery as a Subscription (Baas) model wherein you pay for everything on the scooter except the batteries, which you lease.  Hero claims running costs of just Rs 0.96/km for the VX2 models and if you have purchased it via the BaaS plan and the battery’s performance falls below 70 percent, the company will replace it free of charge.  The Vida VX2 looks different to the earlier V2 and has more of a family-centric design with smooth, flowing lines. It has a near-flat single-piece seat, pillion backrest and a handlebar shroud, which differentiates it from the V2. The headlight, tail light and indicators are shared between the V2 and the VX2. The VX2 also comes with an accessory plastic frunk on the front apron. Plus variant has a few more features, larger battery than Go The Go variant with the 2.2kWh battery has a spacious 33.2 litre boot - the 27.2 litre underseat storage capacity of the Plus is a little smaller, considering it needs to accommodate two batteries instead of just one on the Go. With the supplied 580W charger, the Go variant's battery can be charged fully in 3hr53min, while the Plus takes 5hr39min. Both also have fast-charging capabilities and can be charged from 0-80 percent and 0-100 percent by one of the charges in 1 hour and 2 hours, respectively.  Both models run on 12-inch wheels at both ends and appear to share most of their underpinnings. The VX2’s Go variant comes with a front drum brake because a teaser shared by the company in the buildup to its launch showed a scooter with that. The VX2 Go has a 70kph claimed top speed, whereas the Plus can go a little higher at 80kph.  Another area of differentiation between the Go and the Plus is that the former comes with a 4.3-inch LCD display whereas the latter comes with a 4.3-inch TFT dash. Both come with a suit of connectivity features and a physical key. The Go has 2 riding modes - Eco and Ride - whereas the Plus comes with a Sport mode in addition to these two.  Vida VX2 price and colours The Vida VX2 is available in seven colours - blue, black, yellow, red, white, grey and orange - with the latter two only available on the Plus variant. The Go variant is priced at Rs 59,490 (with BaaS) and Rs 99,490 (without it), while the Plus commands Rs 64,990 (with BaaS) and Rs 1.10 lakh (without it).  All prices ex-showroom, Delhi Also See: Ather Rizta S 3.7kWh launched at Rs 1.38 lakh TVS iQube 3.1 launched at Rs 1.10 lakh",

    "description": "The Delhi government has officially levied restrictions on the supply of fuel to vehicles that it classifies under \"end of life\" status. Starting today, July 1, sale of fuel for petrol vehicles over 15 years of age and diesel vehicles over 10 years of age will be refused in Delhi, and owners caught offending will have their vehicles impounded on the spot. Cameras and alarms will detect end of life vehicles in Delhi fuel stations Enforcement teams deployed at some fuel stations to monitor incoming vehicles Delhi fuel ban for old vehicles explained AI-powered cameras and hooter systems installed at fuel stations At nearly 350 fuel stations across Delhi-NCR, the government has installed automatic number plate reader (ANPR) cameras to detect any end-of-life vehicles that may pull in to refuel. These ANPR cameras are claimed to leverage AI, and work in conjunction with an automated hooter system that sounds an alarm if the cameras read a number plate belonging to an end-of-life vehicle. Offending vehicles to be impounded right away Staff members at fuel stations have been instructed to refuse sale of fuel to end-of-life vehicles, and teams of transport and police department officials were also deployed at some South Delhi fuel stations earlier today to keep an eye out for the same. Should any of these vehicles be caught by the ANPR cameras or enforcement teams, they will be denied fuel and immediately impounded. Following the infamous 2018 Supreme Court ruling that banned plying of petrol vehicles older than 15 years and diesel vehicles older than 10 years in Delhi as part of a concerted effort with the NGT to combat air pollution, this new restriction on fuel sales will make it even more difficult to own an older car or bike in the national capital.
