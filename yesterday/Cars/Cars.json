    "description": "Want to know more about Google’s popular smartphone mirroring service? Take a look at our complete guide Modern life is about having all the information you need at your fingertips, and driving is no different.  While modern infotainment systems largely cover a lot of bases in this respect, they're not quite as connected to your mobile phone as you might like.  That’s why so many drivers use smartphone mirroring systems, such as Android Auto.  An alternative to Apple CarPlay for those with a Google-based phone from makers such as Google, Samsung and Sony, Android Auto gives quick and easy access to a host of applications to keep you connected.  As car makers develop increasingly convoluted infotainment systems, it's even got to the point where many drivers prefer mirroring services like Android Auto over the standard operating system (OS) fitted to their cars. It's no surprise that around 150 million cars worldwide now have Android Auto installed. But what exactly is Android Auto, what services does it offer, and how can you access it? We've put together this comprehensive guide with all the information you need to know.  What is Android Auto? Android Auto is a car-based driving companion created by Google to bring all the convenience of your phone directly to your car’s dashboard. It was initially introduced to improve safety while driving, but there’s a lot you can do with it. It’s a service that lets you connect your Android phone to the car's infotainment system to display sat-nav apps, legally take phone calls, reply to messages and play audio.  These functions are accessed via large icons on your car's infotainment screen and through voice commands. Google says it intends the software to reduce your levels of distraction as much as possible, so the icons should be easy to reach when you're driving.  Android Auto is accessible, too. It’s free of charge for one, and it streamlines your car’s interface with hands-free voice commands, large, easy-to-read icons and integration with some of the mobile world’s most popular apps, including Google Maps, Waze and Spotify.  Android Auto in 2025 It looks like Android Auto will gain several updates in 2025, with the first major update already rolling out to some vehicles and devices.  One of the biggest upgrades will come to the user interface, bringing stronger integration of your vehicle's own systems. For instance, you will be able to control the radio directly through Android Auto, instead of swapping back to your vehicle's own infotainment system. Android Auto will also add some new apps for improved media playback, such as video streaming via programs such as YouTube, Netflix and TikTok, while web browsing will also be implemented.  We're not quite sure when these updates will be fully implemented, but expect them to begin rolling out later this year.  How to connect to Android Auto If you have an Android phone (one developed by a company such as Samsung, OnePlus, Huawei, Nokia, Sony or Google), Android Auto will come pre-installed on your phone if it's operating on Android 10 or above. It’s also free to install on the Google Play Store.  There are two ways of doing this: via USB connection or wirelessly. Firstly, ensure your car is compatible with Android Auto. You can consult Android's guide to every car compatible with the system here.  Using USB If you're using a USB connection, make sure your phone is in range of your mobile data network and plug the USB into your car's port and your phone. The port can be either a USB-A (rectangular) or a USB-C (oval) connector. Instructions will then appear on your car's infotainment screen; follow those steps to continue. You don’t need a Bluetooth connection if you’re using this method. Wireless Some newer cars offer a wireless Android Auto connection too, through Bluetooth or a wi-fi connection. In these, you should go into the infotainment system to set up your phone connection. Once you’ve got them paired up, both your car and your phone will ask if you want to allow permission to use Android Auto. Select yes, and away you go. If you're unsure of your car’s method of connection, have a quick look at the car's manual. Is my phone compatible? There are a few caveats to this one but stick with us. To connect your phone to Android Auto using a USB cable, it has to be running on Android 8 or higher and have an active data plan. If you want to connect it wirelessly to the infotainment system and you have an Android phone that isn't made by Samsung or Google, make sure it’s running on Android 11 or later.  Samsung or Google phones can use Android 10 or later, while Samsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8+ and Note 8 models work with Android 9 or later. Remember that all phones require an active data plan and 5GHz wi-fi support. Most phones have the latter, but if you're experiencing connection issues, it may be down to this. What are the main features of Android Auto? From navigation to music, Android Auto has a host of accessible features. You can make phone calls using your infotainment system, have messages read out to you and even look for chargers for your electric car.  Several companies have developed apps that are compatible with Android Auto. See our list of our favourite Android Auto apps below:  Amazon Music - An alternative to Spotify for your favourite tunes. Audible - Amazon’s app for audiobook playback. Facebook Messenger - Reply to messages sent to your Facebook account through voice-to-text. Google Maps - Google’s own navigation app. ZapMap - Locate an EV charging station quickly using this app, which lists chargers by maximum charging speed. It also tells you if they’re in use or out of order.  Spotify - A popular music and podcast app. WhatsApp - You're able to hear messages you’ve been sent and send messages, or place and receive phone calls, via voice control. Waze - A third-party navigation app with several useful features, such as incident reporting, police car warnings and more. How much does Android Auto cost? Android Auto is free to use and the app is free to download to your phone. However, you may be subject to some data charges if they’re not already included on your mobile phone plan.  Some manufacturers include Android Auto on higher trim levels only, or as an optional extra on entry-level models; but it’s becoming increasingly common for brands to include it as standard, along with Apple CarPlay.  Pros of Android Auto There are several benefits to using Android Auto - and it’s often down to the software that comes with your car.  In fact, many drivers believe Android Auto’s Google Maps integration is more intuitive, accurate and useful than pre-installed sat-nav systems. Google often updates Android Auto, with the latest round adding artificial intelligence (AI) that can summarise messages, read them out to you and reply on your behalf. It’s very handy to have all of your favourite apps at your fingertips when you’re on the move, and voice integration in apps like WhatsApp are useful for staying in contact with your friends and family during long journeys.  Android Auto’s wide selection of apps is also a plus, meaning you can stick to your preferred music or podcast app of choice.  And, if we’re honest, it often looks better than many of the infotainment software systems from some car brands today. Cons of Android Auto While Android Auto might seem like the ideal solution for most phone users, it’s not for everybody.  The ultimate negative of the system is that it can only be used with an Android phone, so it’s not accessible to every driver.  You also need to keep an eye on your data usage with Android Auto, as apps such as Spotify, Amazon Music, or Audible can sap your data allowance if you’re not set to a specific offline mode.  Plus, if you don’t have the right cable or your car can’t offer wireless connectivity, you might not be able to connect to Android Auto at all. If you’re not a fan of touchscreens, you might want to avoid Android Auto, too, as most functions are controlled via your car’s infotainment system.",

    "description": "The R4 is back after a 30-year hiatus as a no-nonsense and practical electric crossover Renault reckons the new Renault 4 is a thorough reinvention that retains all the versatility of the old model. And in some respects the french manufacturer is right. This new car is versatile. It’s longer than the new Renault 5 it shares a platform with and has more occupant room. Boot space - at 420 litres - is 100 litres larger than that car and it’s larger than most of its rivals too, plus it has an underfloor compartment for the cables. Good bit of ground clearance too.Yet. In some respects, this new R4 is a world away from the old model in terms of versatility. The old R4 sold more than 8 million units, was made in 18 countries and earned the nickname of ‘blue jeans car’ because of its ubiquitousness.It is a car that gave a good deal of the world personal mobility, much like the Mini or Fiat 500. It is a car with a simple range of robust four-cylinders that can survive 30,000 miles without a service and easily nudge past the 500,000-mile mark. If you go to North Africa it is still one of the most common cars on the road.Whereas the new car will only be built in France - with a lot of its parts also being assembled there too. And while there are plans to sell in Europe, South America and Japan the lack of electric infrastructure hinders its sales elsewhere in the world. So it’s pretty different from the original.",

Others look complete, until you scrutinize them and discover a lack of wiring—or the infamous ‘Bluetooth brakes.’ Richard ‘Mule’ Pollock operates on another level. This pristine Harley Sportster street tracker is ready to shine at a show or tear up the streets. But Mule still has a laundry list of mods that he plans to throw at it. The bike started as a humble 1997-model Harley-Davidson XL883 Sportster. The order came from a customer in New York, while the donor bike came from a friend of Mule’s over in Connecticut. The brief was simple enough—build a signature Mule street tracker with all the trimmings.…",

    "description": "When you’re late to the game, the best way to make an entry is with innovation. That’s exactly what Alpinestars did when they got into the motorcycle helmet market with the SM10 about six years ago. Having recently moved to this helmet after retiring my Leat GPX 5.5 (another innovative product), there’s a lot of out-of-the-box thinking that I’ve appreciated. The M10's snap-fit peak mechanism is convenient. For starters, I love the way the peak fit flush with the shell. The safety advantage is that the smooth interface leaves no edges or fasteners to catch on the ground in the fall, but the big benefit to me is the unique snap-fit fastening mechanism. There are no screws involved, and you can just pull the peak off or snap it back into place, which is a huge convenience if you regularly travel with the helmet. The downside of this design is that the peak position is not adjustable. The M10's liner has speaker cutouts. Other nice touches include speaker pockets and a three-way adjustable headband that can slightly adjust the angle at which the helmet sits on your head. There are grooves in the inner EPS liner for you to neatly route a drinks tube from a hydration bladder. Astars has also extended the EPS liner down below the cutout of the outer shell in the collarbone area. This is to reduce the chance of common injuries when the helmet hits the collarbone in a crash. Like many off-road helmets, this one also uses a variation of the MIPS (Multi-Directional Impact Protection System) technology. This enables a small amount of rotational slip between the outer shell and the inner liner, which is supposed to reduce the chances of concussion and other brain/neck injuries. The shell is constructed in a tri-composite material that uses carbon fibre, carbon composite and aramid fibres. Weighing in at 1,180gm, this would have been considered in the middle ground a few years ago, but it is now quite light with today’s stricter safety standards.   There are a huge number of vents all over the helmet (I counted 28!), and as you’d expect, the airflow is superb. The vision port is also very large, which means you should be able to fit a big pair of goggles without any issues. The comfort padding is fully removable and washable, and it uses an interesting fastening system, where you first align the buttons and then slide them into place. It works well once you figure it out. The M10's liner has exceptional ventilation. With a head circumference of 56.5cm, I’m in the no man’s land between sizes S and M. I went with the S that I usually use with other brands, but I find it a bit too tight. Astars has 5mm thinner accessory cheek pads that I’m keen to try, but I suspect it might have been smarter to go for the M size (which uses a larger shell) and then opt for the 5mm thicker accessory cheek pads if necessary. Just another reminder of why you must always try before you buy. Priced between USD 650 and USD 800, this helmet is on par with the competition from top rival brands. The M10 ships with a spare peak and a bag that’s spacious enough to hold a pair of goggles and even a jersey and pants set without the armour. While the helmet does feel very well-made, there is still a small margin to be gained in terms of ultimate quality and plushness when compared to something like an Arai. But in pure performance terms, this helmet is superb, and it can justify its price.

    "description": "Tata Motors has dropped the first teaser of the upcoming Altroz facelift ahead of its price announcement on May 22. The premium hatchback has been periodically updated with new powertrain options and new features, but it hasn’t received a cosmetic makeover since it went on sale in January 2020. An updated design aside, there will also be new features on the inside, but the Altroz is expected to remain mechanically unchanged. Altroz facelift gets new bumpers and lighting signatures Will have a larger touchscreen, 360-degree camera Expected to remain mechanically unchanged Tata Altroz facelift: what to expect? New fascia, larger touchscreen on the inside  The teaser video hints at a significantly revised fascia for the facelift – the split arrangement has been retained for the headlamps, but these are now full LED units and it comes with a new brow-like LED daytime running lamp signature as well. The bumper has been updated with new vertical recesses for the fog lamp housing, and there's a new design for the grille as well. At the rear, the Altroz gets new LED tail lamps with a T motif, and it is connected by an LED light bar. The rear bumper looks much sportier with a dual-tone finish, and it also gets new flush-fitting door handles that are illuminated. There's also a new EV-esque design for the alloy wheels, and new colour options are expected, too.  Tata hasn’t given us a glimpse of the interior yet, but we expect a revised dashboard with new soft-touch materials along with new colour options for the upholstery. The larger 10.25-inch touchscreen will be made available across more variants; currently it is only available with the Racer variant. It will also get a new digital instrument cluster and 360-degree camera. Tata Altroz facelift powertrain options Five powertrain options expected to be carried forward  The Altroz is currently on sale with as many as five powertrain options – the range starts with an 88hp, 1.2-litre petrol that’s offered with a 5-speed manual and 6-speed dual-clutch auto gearbox; a 73.5hp factory-fit CNG version, and a 90hp, 1.5-litre diesel engine option are also available. The CNG and diesel-powered Altroz come with a 5-speed manual only. Meanwhile, the top-spec Altroz Racer shares its 120hp, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual transmission with the Tata Nexon. All five powertrain options are expected to be retained. Crucially, the Altroz will continue to be the sole hatchback in the country to be sold with a diesel engine. Altroz update arriving amidst dwindling sales for hatchbacks  Upon launch, the updated Altroz will continue to rival the Maruti Suzuki Baleno, Toyota Glanza and the Hyundai i20. The premium hatchback segment has been steadily losing ground to compact SUVs, with Altroz currently averaging monthly sales of about 2,000 units – down from its peak of about 5,000 units in FY2021-22. The upcoming facelift could be an impetus to sales. Also See: Volkswagen Golf GTi bookings open on May 5 Mahindra Thar Convertible Top variants discontinued",

    "description": "Royal Enfield has opened online rider registrations for the 2025 edition of its Continental GT Cup. This year the hunt for budding racers has been extended to eight cities, up from four last year. Zonal selection rounds will be held in Chennai, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Guwahati, Delhi-NCR, Pune and Bengaluru.  Two distinct series– Pro-Am and Twin Power Trophy A valid driving license is the only eligibility criteria 2025 Royal Enfield Continental GT Cup dates Selected riders will be using race-specced RE Continental GT650 Through the eight zonal rounds, Royal Enfield will select 64 amateur and 50 pro riders who will make it to the final selection round. This will be held at Coimbatore’s Kari Motor Speedway from July 3–6, 2025. 24 of the fastest riders from each category (amateur and pro) will earn a place on the final grid. This year’s series will also run as part of the JK Tyre National Racing Championship from August to november 2025. Royal Enfield started the Continental GT Cup in 2021 to make track racing more accessible to both newcomers and experienced riders. Those who make it to the grid will race on GT-R650 motorcycles, built to identical specifications to put rider skill at the forefront. 2025 Royal Enfield Continental GT Cup registrations Selection to be held at eight venues The Royal Enfield GT Cup provides an opportunity to Royal Enfield owners to race on track as well. The only criteria is a valid driving license. The participants can register in either professional or amateur category based on their skill-set and eligibility.  At each location, the short-listed riders will get access to a track for two days. Day 1 will consist of training with expert riders from the Royal Enfield Track School and the Day 2 will be reserved for selections based on lap times of each rider.  Royal Enfield will continue with its Pro-Am format that essentially gives the amateur riders a chance to compete with the professional ones. Also returning is the Twin-Power Trophy. In this series, each pro rider will be paired with an amateur rider to form a team, giving rookies an opportunity to learn from the professional racers. 2025 RE Continental GT Cup selection roundsCityVenueDateGuwahatiWarisa Estate, SonapurMay 10 to May 11NoidaFormula 11 TrackMay 17 to May 18AhmedabadIndikartingMay 24 to May 25MumbaiFortune Karting Raceway HakoneMay 31 to June 1PuneKartdrome June 7 to June 8HyderabadChicane Circuit June 14 to June 15BangaloreMeco KartopiaJune 21 to June 22ChennaiECR Speedway Race TrackJune 28 to June 29 Also see: 2025 Spanish MotoGP: Alex Marquez takes maiden win as Marc crashes out",

As we saw in our last installment, the angular late Sixties look of the Eldorado (lauded by almost everyone) was replaced with a curved and bloated shape which grew in all dimensions over its predecessor. Today we take a look at the lavish interior accommodations of the 1971 model and talk about cost cutting.",
