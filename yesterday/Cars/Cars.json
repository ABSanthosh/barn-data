    "description": "Can the average person spot an original from a replica, asks Prior In a car park sits the oldest Porsche in the UK, just the 32nd ever made, worth the best part of £2.7 million. It’s a creamy yellow 356, from 1950, back when Porsches were still made in Gmünd, Austria. It has a brilliantly detailed history, has never been restored, would make a terrific bookend to a billionaire’s expansive Porsche collection and could easily be entered into those concours events where they value ultimate originality. No question, it’s one of the most important cars in the history of the world’s greatest sports car maker. “That’s a nice car,” a dog walker says as she passes by. “Did you build it yourself?” Ouch. Imagine. This car’s custodian is very gracious about the enquiry, and perhaps it’s an understandable one: there are many 356 replicas around, easily based on Volkswagen Beetles, because the 356 itself used many Beetle parts. And besides, it’s a graceful shape, so you can see why people would want one. But given that more than 75,000 356s were made, there are probably more originals than there are replicas. Now imagine being the owner of an original Ford GT40 or AC/Shelby Cobra. Original ones are vastly outnumbered by those that aren’t the real thing, whether they’re ‘faithful’ reproductions or not. Particularly when it comes to Cobras. This isn’t a new phenomenon: there are so, so very many Cobras that aren’t Cobras in the world, self-built or otherwise. Have been for decades. When I was a lad, I had a classic car magazine that included a drive feature of an original 427 Cobra, in which the writer records a bloke from some nearby scaffolding shouting an enquiry about whether “it has a Jag engine”, having assumed the exquisite aluminium-bodied car wasn’t the real deal. It’s against this backdrop, plus ongoing acrimony with Shelby in the US – which makes cars actually badged as Cobras, having licensed the name from Ford – that AC Cars, as featured in news and first drives, has decided it’s time to get out of that game of making Cobras, even though they’re actually Cobras and are shaped like Cobras. In the form of the Ace Classic and Ace Bristol Classic, plus the exciting and promising new Cobra GT Roadster, the company has decided it’s time to do something different. It’s possible for companies to fight a corner, of course. Caterham once forced Westfield to change the shape of its Seven replica, JLR even sued a Swedish individual who built a Jaguar C-Type replica in his garage (the Magnussons won on appeal, but the court recognised the design’s copyright in cases where people were seeking commercial gain from it), Moke is frequently tied up in it and woe betide you if you make a fake Mercedes-Benz 300 SL, given that those have been sent to the crusher before. AC has concluded that if you’re fed up with people joining you, you should instead beat them. The Ace is a lovely and distinctive shape and the Cobra GT Roadster wilfully moves the game forward, both from an engineering and a design perspective. “It had to be visually different,” AC engineering chief Jon Peeke-Vout told me at the Bognor Regis factory last week. “It’s a modern car but it’s got the DNA of an AC,” company chairman Alan Lubinsky said down the phone later. It’s a novel idea and not unlike that of Ford, which, to my knowledge, never really bothered itself about the dozens of different GT40-lookalike manufacturers that have sprung up over the years. Instead, it created a new GT, and then another one, and then took it racing, looking ahead, rather than backwards. As a template for where to take a legend, that’s not a bad one to follow.",

    "description": "These five home-made heroes show why the UK remains a key volume car maker It’s all bad news these days, isn’t it? Or it certainly feels like it if you dare to pay attention to global politics. Step away from the doom-mongering, though and you’ll find good news aplenty when it comes to UK automotive manufacturing. And much of that hinges on the eclectic crew of cars assembled here. These cars play a key role in the success of the UK automotive industry – an industry that was responsible for a turnover of £93 billion in 2023, up from £78bn in 2022, according to the SMMT. In fact, only food production tops the automotive industry for economic value in the UK’s manufacturing sector. So let’s take a closer look at the cars that drive that industry and the ongoing success stories that we should be proud of. Mini Mini is a good place to start. Nosing into the car park above the British Motor Museum at Gaydon, our Mini Cooper S – all smooth-surfaced and aquamarine – is an instant hit. Not only is the colour pretty remarkable, but the car also has an instant draw to it. From the chunky yet dinky proportions to the wide-eyed gaze and the certain promise that it’s going to be as fun to drive as it is to look at, the Mini’s hold on car buyers isn’t hard to fathom. Nor is it difficult to work out why that hold has been constant since BMW first revealed the ‘new’Mini back in 1997 as a concept car at the Frankfurt show. Would people really be willing to pay a premium for a small but ‘posh’ car? Aren’t small cars purely for the budget realms? Well, yes, people would and, no, small cars are not. And boy, did Mini prove that. Still is, in fact. As I whizz (the Mini definitely whizzes in a distinctive fashion) around the Warwickshire countryside, the burbling 2.0-litre turbo petrol engine boosting us along and the quick steering giving that characteristic darty, urgent response, it’s easy to see why the Mini has been such a lasting success story. There really is nothing else like a Mini. From the colours and personalisation to the plush interior finish, the immediacy of the driving style and the sheer desirability of it, BMW was onto a winning formula from the off. And it’s had the good sense to stick to that formula for all of the four generations of this modern classic since its showroom debut in 2001. Naturally, the Mini has had to evolve along the way and it was something of a pioneer with electrification after BMW introduced  the battery-powered Mini E as a limited-production vehicle in 2010, before launching the rather more polished and effective Mini Electric in 2020. Our Mini Cooper S is here because it is built in Cowley, but give it a year or so and the all-new electric Mini Cooper E and SE will join it at the Oxfordshire plant – which celebrated its 110th anniversary as a production facility last year and was responsible for more than 20% of the UK’s vehicle manufacturing output in 2023. For some context, that’s nearly 185,000 cars, which happens because Cowley can produce up to 1000 cars per day – one every 67 seconds. This model has dominated the small, premium car class since it arrived in 2001, and its enduring appeal is testament to the Mini’s consistent design brilliance – all of which is, of course, directly responsible for the ongoing success story at Cowley. And talking of ongoing success stories… Range Rover Evoque Let’s turn to another British brand represented here next. We’re all about patriotism right now, after all. Our Range Rover Evoque sits adorned in gentle, rose-gold accents and exudes a sense of ‘want one’ that few cars costing twice as much could lay claim to. Even though this is the ‘baby’ Range Rover, it’s still got a surplus of swagger and premium lustre, much of which is, of course, down to that design. Ever since the original Evoque arrived in 2011, it has proven that prestige appeal can translate very well indeed to a more affordable, compact SUV. In many ways, in fact, it did a similar thing to that class of car as the Mini did to the small car segment: prove that there was an army of buyers out there who were happy to pay – and pay well – for a compact yet premium product. You will see plenty of Land Rovers and Range Rovers around Gaydon, of course, with this being the company’s headquarters. But I bet you still notice every one of them. I know that I do. And I know that, pointing our plug-in hybrid Evoque P300e at the countryside and enjoying the wafty silence of the electric running, there is smug factor to spare despite this being the entry-level Range Rover.  There is something unique about the way any Range Rover drives and that’s all the more impressive these days, given how competitive the class is. But between the driving position, the oily smoothness of the steering and the long-legged ride comfort as it eases around Warwickshire’s motorways and B-roads, there’s no doubting that the Range Rover Evoque is a class act. Interestingly, it also occurs to me that it is, in a cold, clinical sense, ultimately a rival to the Nissan Qashqai that we have also gathered here. Yet it’s not really, is it? True, the Qashqai is more premium than ever, and actually a delight to drive – more on that in a moment. But the Evoque, even though it sits in the same mid-sized SUV sector, feels like a completely different prospect. It’s that weirdly intangible essence of Land Rovers; you could sit blindfolded in a Jaguar or Land Rover and you’d know what it was. I doubt it’s being bought by the same people as the Qashqai either, and it’s a credit to both cars that they have so successfully captured the hearts and ongoing PCP finance obligations of their respective audiences. A quick note on the manufacturing stuff too: JLR, of course, has production plants at both Halewood and Solihull. The Castle Bromwich facility was, sadly, closed in May this year, but output from all three of JLR’s sites in 2023 was an impressive 238,422 cars. There are also plans under way for new electric models, with a battery-powered Range Rover due soon, and a four-door electric Jaguar following not long after, so this is not a company that’s standing still. And it remains a brand – and an array of products – that the UK can and should be very proud of. Nissan Qashqai We’ve already mentioned the Qashqai, but before we talk about why this rather lovely e-Power test car proves to be such a hit, let’s put Nissan’s success and manufacturing productivity into context. Poster child of the crossover era, the Qashqai and its equally genre-defining sibling, the Nissan Juke, are both straight out of the Sunderland plant. You thought BMW’s Cowley figures were impressive? Nissan’s Sunderland plant produced 325,218 vehicles in 2023 – nearly 88,000 more vehicles than were churned out at Cowley. During that year, the Nissan Leaf was also in production alongside the Juke and Qashqai, but that came to an end earlier this year to allow Nissan to tool up for the start of production of its forthcoming new electric cars. They really are a phenomenon, Nissan’s crossovers. We motoring hacks might roll our eyes at the rash of SUV-ish cars that have appeared in the wake of Nissan’s decades-long mic drop – which started when the original Qashqai arrived in 2006. But as I sit in the rather lovely Alcantara-clad cabin and whir smoothly around courtesy of the clever e-Power drivetrain that arrived with the third-generation Qashqai in 2021, it’s not hard to see why it’s such a perennial favourite. It’s solid, comfortable, dependable, efficient and a completely known quantity. Yet the Qashqai has never felt boring and beige, which is its real magic. This powertrain is also a great example of Nissan’s ingenuity when it comes to how it’s evolved to cater to the masses over the years. With power streaming directly from the electric motor, the set-up gives the eerily delightful, uninterrupted progress of an EV with all the convenience of petrol power and low emissions. The car also handles with impressive control, keeping its body from leaning too much and giving an enviable sense of composure whether you’re winding through a torturous urban school run or threading down open countryside as I am. It is one of those cars that just feels instantly friendly and intuitive. Between that and an interior that now feels genuinely very classy as well as solidly built and roomy, you can see why this is a default option in the family SUV world. It’s absolutely no surprise, then, that both the Qashqai and the Juke were among the top five best-selling cars in the UK last year – the Qashqai being at number one, with 42,704 sales. It’s great news all round really as Sunderland’s prosperity looks set to continue, even as it gears up to introduce its new EV line-up. Toyota Corolla Is there anything more delightfully common sense than a Toyota Corolla? I’m not sure. The Vauxhall Combo Life that we’ve got here may give it a run for its money on the humble-but-useful front, but in the scheme of cars rather than van-based goodness, the Corolla is a pillar of honest, reliable value. You want a car that will work, won’t cost a fortune to run and will accommodate all your stuff? Buy a Corolla. But in truth, that may be doing the Corolla a disservice these days. If you haven’t driven one, find an excuse to, because they’re surprisingly wieldy and even – dare I say it – fun. The 1.8-litre hybrid powertrain in our test car is the one that most people will go for, over the 2.0-litre option that’s also offered, because it’s the more affordable and more efficient engine in the line-up. The 1.8 set-up also thrums along nicely and the steering is surprisingly enjoyable – pleasantly weighted, responsive without being nervous, and allowing you to make good use of the grip. Basically, this is a well-sorted car. One that’s weirdly satisfying to fling about as you can make full use of all its potential, and because nobody expects to be harried by a Corolla. It’s not just about the warranty (10 years if you keep it serviced with Toyota) and sensibleness. It’s comfy and decent to drive too. Even the police force want them, with 20 constabularies across the UK now running Corollas on their fleets. So maybe we should actually start worrying about being harried by Corollas… So stop sniggering about Ubers and remember that the Corolla is a legend. A global phenomenon of straightforward mainstream goodness. And one that’s made right here at Toyota’s Burnaston plant, which produced 121,871 units in 2023, including the Corolla hatch and Touring Sports, with Toyota’s engine plant in Deeside also adding to the Japanese brand’s productivity in the UK.  But if even the Corolla Touring Sports isn’t useful enough for you, how about our next British-made delight? Vauxhall Combo Life Electric So, to the final bastion of sensibleness in our celebration of UK manufacturing. The Vauxhall Combo Life Electric is produced at Stellantis’s Ellesmere Port plant together with other variants of the electric ‘EK9’ compact van from Vauxhall, Peugeot, Citroën and Fiat Pro. It’s 62 years since Ellesmere Port began production of the Vauxhall Viva and in recent years it has received a £100 million investment to turn it into a manufacturer of electric vans and – with the Combo Life – passenger vehicles.  In fact, the Combo Life Electric and other passenger variants of Stellantis’s compact electric van series are set to go into full mainstream production from this week (starting on 14 October). Production numbers at Ellesmere Port are currently still low. With the transition being made last year, only 4308 vehicles were produced in 2023, although that’s inching up in 2024. Let’s not forget Luton too, where Stellantis still manufactures ICE versions of its medium van, including the Vauxhall Vivaro. Passenger versions of these are in the works for the near future at the Luton facility, although there’s no confirmed date yet for when they will begin. The space, though… Every time I get reacquainted with van-based family cars, I wonder why anyone who values practicality as a priority thinks that an SUV is the answer. A van is the answer. A van is the answer to most things in life, in fact. And the Combo Life has that tidy, soft-edged utilitarianism of a van that was always designed to carry people as well as stuff. There’s a vast boot, cushy seats, sensible dashboard, plenty of light and surprisingly smart material finishes. Even in our brief acquaintance, this feels like one of those sensible cars that will only become more charming and lovable as the miles and years tick by, in the way of well-worn slippers and favourite armchairs. So there you have it: a buffet of British-made wonders, ranging from the resoundingly sensible to the truly aspirational, and everything in between. It’s really not just the sheer volume of UK vehicle production that we should be proud of, but also the fact that these are world-class cars in their own right",

    "description": "It’s hard not to get carried away when riding on mountain roads in Southern California. Maybe it's the crisp, cool high-altitude air that tricks you into feeling relaxed, even when the speeds are anything but. We certainly got carried away in the twisties during our first ride aboard the new Royal Enfield Bear 650, and it wasn’t entirely to do with that cool mountain air. Confused? Understandable. After all, why should a scrambler-ised version of the already hefty and not very sharp Interceptor be egging us on in the corners? Well, as it turns out, the Bear is much more than just a scrambler-ised Interceptor. Royal Enfield Bear 650: design, features Sure, many of the changes have been made with the intent of making the Bear better suited to off-roading. You’ve now got an upside-down fork (in place of the Interceptor’s conventional unit) offering more travel – up from 110mm to 130mm. It’s a similar story at the rear, too; the Bear sticks with a twin shock setup, but travel has grown from 88mm to 115mm. As a result, seat height and ground clearance have also increased, and now stand at 830mm and 184mm, respectively. But to accommodate the new suspension components and adapt the bike to its more off-road-focused role, Royal Enfield has had to strengthen the frame in multiple areas. It’s the same basic frame as the Interceptor, but it has now been braced in various areas to add strength and stiffness, and the sub-frame has been revised as well. The end result is a chassis that feels noticeably stiffer than the Interceptor’s. Attacking corners hard, the Bear does feels hinged in the middle, and the sort of mid-corner bumps that would have the Interceptor wobbling and wallowing all over the place are simply shrugged off. There’s great feedback and you really have the confidence to keep carrying more speed into a corner, and leaning further and further, despite the more off-road centric 19in/17in wheel on offer. This is also, in no small part, down to the excellent new tyres wrapped around those wheels – you’re unlikely to have heard of the MRF Nylorex tyres before and that’s because they’re a new dual-purpose model that have been developed specifically for this motorcycle. Despite the blocky pattern, the grip, profile and predictably on the road were superb, and there were no complaints when on tarmac. Part of the Bear’s playfulness in the twisties can also be attributed to the suspension setup. The front fork strikes a nice balance between comfort and performance, but the shocks feel rather firm and unforgiving. This was the case across riders of different weights, even at the minimum preload setting. On the largely excellent Californian tarmac, it wasn’t a deal-breaker, but the firm edge could be felt, and rough patches translated to my backside without sufficient mitigation. How this setup fares on the less than perfect roads back home is something we’ll have to find out in due course. Royal Enfield Bear 650: performance, ergonomics Many of the numbers are bigger with the new Bear, and while most of that is good, one big number that’s got some people a little apprehensive is the seat height. Yes, 830mm is definitely on the taller side – I’m not very tall, only 5’8”, which means I can’t flat-foot both feet. That said, it isn’t unmanageable either, and with a little bit of forward planning, you can comfortably pick either one side to flat-foot. It also helps that the footpegs are now a little further forward, so they don’t foul your shins as much. The other change to the riding position is the handlebar, which is wider and a little further away from you. The wider part is nice, it gives you more leverage over the bike, which I like. The further away part, I’m not such a fan of – it’s a bit more of a forward reach than I’d like, and if you’re short like me, then this could become a point of fatigue over long rides. On the upside, this is now a lighter motorcycle than the model it’s based on. Moving to this new 2-into-1 exhaust setup has helped shed a bunch of weight, though some of that has been added back through the suspension and the frame strengthening. Nevertheless, it is still 2kg lighter than the Interceptor. However, at 216kg, still a fairly hefty motorcycle. You only really feel this at low speeds and when paddling about, and once you’re on the move, the Bear masks its weight rather well. The new exhaust has done more than just trimming the weight – it’s also allowed RE to squeeze out some more torque from the motor; it now produces 56.5Nm vs the 52Nm we’ve seen from it so far. So the engine feels a little more punchy now, while still remaining the pleasant, fairly refined, characterful motor that we’ve fallen in love with over the last 6 years. The new exhaust has slightly changed the sound, though. It exits a little closer to you and doesn’t run quite as far back as the twin-pipe designs, which is one of the factors at play. Overall, it’s a little more braap-y and raspy, as opposed to the more sweet-sounding twin pipe 650s. I think this suits the character of the Bear rather well. Royal Enfield Bear 650: off-road performance Now, we come to the big question of off-road performance. We didn’t have a great deal of opportunity to ride the Bear off-road – we only got a short spin up and down a fairly simple gravel track. But the feeling is that this is definitely more of a soft-roader than a hardcore off-roader. The suspension can absorb some hits, up to a point, and these new tyres seem to work well off-road. The rear ABS can also be turned off. So yes, you can have some fun off-road. But the weight makes its presence felt, and the ergos are halfway between on-road and off-road, so this is not a bike you’d want to push very hard when the tarmac runs out. But you won’t have to turn around either. Turning off that rear ABS is done through a fully-digital TFT display –  this is the first Royal Enfield 650 to get one, and it’s the same unit you’ll find on the Himalayan. Which means, you also get features like Bluetooth connectivity and Google Maps integration. It’s also the first RE 650 to get full-LED lighting. The only other noteworthy feature is a USB charging port, but as is the case with all REs now, there is a comprehensive list of accessories that covers the usual suspects, like touring mirrors and a touring seat, as well as more scrambler-specific items like a sump guard and a headlight grille. Royal Enfield Bear 650: Verdict The final piece of the puzzle is the price – and starting at Rs 3.39 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) and going up to Rs 3.59 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), the Bear sits between the Interceptor and GT on one end and the Shotgun and Super Meteor on the other. Having ridden it around California, it feels like the most versatile and competent RE 650 today. It can cruise, it can tour, it can commute, you can corner pretty hard – it’s a great road bike – and it’s got some off-road ability as well. But how much of a pain the firm suspension setup will be back home in India is something we’ll only be able to tell you a little further down the road. Test rides and deliveries begin on November 10, so it shouldn’t be too long before we find out. Also See: Royal Enfield Bear 650 video review",

    "description": "When Bryan Fuller learned that BMW had secretly sent prototype 1,800 cc engines to a handful of custom builders ahead of the BMW R18’s release, he went straight into imagination mode. The founder of Fuller Moto couldn’t get the big boxer out of his mind—so when he was finally approached to build a custom R18, you’d better believe he was on board. The original BMW R18 concept bike was heavily inspired by the BMW R5—a bike that Bryan has been lucky enough to study closely. But when the R18 finally hit the market, it had grown considerably in size. Once you get the mammoth power cruiser off the line, the weight magically disappears and it’s a total hoot to ride. Nevertheless, the the fact that it has a reverse gear speaks volumes.…",

    "description": "Exactly 25 years ago, in September 1999, Autocar India started its innings with the new Ford Ikon on the cover. A world exclusive, the story showcased Ford’s new sedan for India, powered by the powerful and responsive 1.6-litre Rocam engine. The car was a delight to drive, the engine was super responsive, and this set the tone for the future of Ford in India. The even bigger story, though, was that this was Ford’s first new car after the Mahindra-Ford JV had been dissolved. Fast forward 25 years and Ford India is set to make a comeback after its planned Mahindra alliance was aborted. Talk about history repeating itself. And the Ford that is likely to go on sale first is the 2024 Everest. Previously known as the Endeavour in India, Ford’s new Everest is an SUV that is much missed here. A more sophisticated rival to Toyota’s Fortuner, Ford’s big SUV always rode better, drove better and was more luxurious and comfortable inside.   The plan Now, with the closest place we could get our hands on Ford’s Everest being Nepal, and Ford almost certain to retain the Everest name in India (for the first time), we just had to try and drive the Everest up to where we could see Mt Everest. You can catch a glimpse of the famous mountain from the top of a hill not too far from Kathmandu, called Nagarkot. Getting to Nagarkot, however, involves a long ascent where you climb almost a kilometre, and once up, there’s no guarantee we’ll be able to see Sagarmatha or ‘head of the sky’ as Mt Everest is called in Nepali. The mountain is around 110km away and appears as a small peak between two closer (so ‘taller’ looking) peaks. And that’s not it; with monsoon clouds bouncing off the high Himalayas and collecting at their base at this time of  year, we’ll need a gap in the high clouds to see it.  View from Nagarkot, 2,175m, in pictogram above. (SOURCE: Google Maps)   Familiar but different Nepal initially feels very familiar. There are plenty of Tatas, Mahindras and Marutis present and the drivers in Nepal seem to have graduated from the same driving schools as drivers in India. Bikes slip though every gap, drivers here practice the same ‘cut, thrust and parry’ and not even monks practice defensive driving.  20-inch wheels and ‘tough’ alloys hit the spot. Coming face to face with the new Everest at the Go Ford dealership gives me some succour. It looks even more imposing and larger. And around the side, it gives me the impression of being larger than even the Endeavour we had in India. Marginally longer and built on a 40mm longer wheelbase, the real reason it looks bigger, however, is that this big body-on-frame SUV is now even more block like. The nose is wider and more square and the ‘C’-shaped LEDs that frame the headlight clusters accentuate the width. The flat bonnet is also full of cuts and creases, the chrome bars that flank the Ford logo give the bluff cowl a modern look and what also adds muscle are the mildly flared fenders. In profile, the big 20-inch wheels help give this big SUV a solid, planted look, and I really like the ‘tough’ two-tone design of the alloys. The bi-turbo badge below the fender tells us this diesel has two turbos placed in series. Go back further and the widened rear fenders help give the Everest a nice wide stance from the rear as well. The cabin isn’t too tall, it’s nicely tucked in from the lower body and what really catches my eye are the clear tail-lights that light up bright red. I even like the manner in which the word Everest has been boldly emblazoned across the rear.  Everest iconography shifted here from the spare. in India as well.   Endeavour, expidition It’s afternoon by the time we leave Kathmandu. The traffic hasn’t gotten any better and slipping this massive supertanker into the stream of traffic proves to be tricky. The arterial roads we initially traverse are narrow and full of parked vehicles, so I really have to inch forward carefully. Visibility from the driver’s seat is good, and the light and very accurate steering makes it easy to place the Everest; important in a vehicle of this bulk. The steering doesn’t quite seem to have the heft of the earlier Endeavour, but the Everest’s steering is quicker at low speeds. That, along with the relative lack of effort to twirl it, sort of makes this bulky SUV feel a bit easier to manage.  As we leave the confines of the city and get onto faster roads, I notice that the ride is very comfortable. It isn’t just the bump absorption, that SUVs like this one normally ace it’s also the refinement, the flat ride and the relative lack of secondary movement associated with a body-on-frame SUV like this. Ride isn’t pillow soft, but the manner in which the Everest absorbs a section of bad road – silently, smoothly and without any hint of heave-ho – makes it both comfortable to sit in and effortless to drive. I just don’t need to slow down unless the holes are particularly large and deep. And the Everest also feels very stable at speed. It even feels more planted the faster you go; Ford’s big boy really does give you plenty of confidence to press on. The climb Once we turn off for Nagarkot, we transition onto some wide ghat roads that sweep around in a nice flow. Leading us ever upwards, the wide sweepers are well paved for the most part. Since there’s practically no traffic, I can really enjoy the drive up. The big takeaway here is that the Everest feels light on its feet and ever ready to change direction.  And it isn’t just the quick steering, it’s a combination of factors. One key contributor has to be Ford’s superb body control and poise. Almost always comfortable in a corner, it feels well balanced and ever willing to alter its line. This is a clear step up on the last-gen Endeavour sold in our market and the confidence it delivers from behind the wheel means you always feel relaxed and enjoy going quicker. Wish the brakes had more bite though. The only time you ‘feel’ the weight of the Everest is when you have to get relatively hard on the brakes. More initial bite and better pedal feel needed here for sure.   Bi-turbo engine gives the Everest an X factor. Half way through our one kilometre or so climb, we run into what feels like a mini cloudburst. Rivulets of water stream down the ghats and we have to clamber over some small rocks that have run down along with the water and silt. The Everest just takes everything in its stride, casually hopping over everything.  As we carry on our way up the mountain, now looking down on the weather below, what I also realise is that the bi-turbo engine contributes significantly to the Everest’s  effortless nature. Incidentally, the engine’s still made in India, and it’s smooth, refined and always on the boil. Refinement, in fact, is so good, it feels like a new generation of engine. And what I especially like is how quickly it responds to a tap on the throttle. With 210hp and 500Nm of torque, it clearly can deliver the goods at higher engine speeds. And here, too, there is no hesitation. There are no flat spots and no surges over practically the entire rev range. And that’s despite the engine being driven by a pair of turbos in sequence; something that’s difficult to do. Not sure how seamlessly this engine will transition from its current EU IV state of tune to our BS VI equivalent, though. 2.0 diesel is made in India; is smooth, seamless and makes 210hp and 500Nm of torque. Even the 10-speed automatic gearbox feels more responsive and intuitive. It still shifts up too early when you lift off the throttle to cruise and only comes a gear down, instead of two, when you tap the throttle. Still, the gearbox works better with this bi-turbo engine as the small turbo spins easily providing sufficient boost at low engine speeds. What irks is that there are no paddles on the steering wheel, only fiddly plus and minus buttons on the gear lever; odd on an otherwise well-specified SUV. What’s cool, however, is how the electrically driven gear selector returns on its own to P if you open the door or even switch the car off in D; remember to try it.   You can shift gears manually using these buttons.   Looking out, looking in We only reach the top of Nagarkot at sundown. Our weather app says there should be a small window the next morning, especially when it comes to medium clouds, and that’s just what we are hoping for. The next morning, though, it all seems pointless – we are enveloped in cloud. So we begin to shoot the exterior; details, highlights and some bits inside the cabin that are well lit. Then, just as we are about to give up hope, a sliver of light opens out, with the gap getting larger every minute. Soon, we can see many peaks close to us and some of the high Himalayas in the distance. We quickly look in the direction of the Everest using our GPS and train our cameras on the dark peak; it’s often the one with the least snow on it because of the high winds. But now, the clouds are back – in batches – drawing a veil of white over the range on and off. Clouds bubbling up from below as the earth heats up. More gaps open later and we see what we think is the Everest. Drive modes and off-road settings are easily accessible from here; no need to fiddle with screen. But the clouds cover it again, and with nothing to do but wait, I decide to take a closer look at the cabin. There’s loads to like here and my attention is initially drawn to how it feels like there’s a bit more space inside. This Everest feels wider and there appears to be more driver space. This version also gets powered and cooled front seats that are big and comfortable even on long drives.  What I am drawn to next is the 12-inch Tesla-like screen with its portrait orientation and sharp details. Apple CarPlay works nicely here and what’s neat is that you can scale up Apple CarPlay at the touch of a button. The screen runs Ford’s Sync 4A software and what’s also Tesla-like here is that you get a digital sketchpad; for when you are waiting and the kids are bored. It’s only software, so why not. You also get a 360-degree camera and, as earlier, a valet mode. Cool graphics work with off-road modes. The Everest also gets a full suite of ADAS functions, with pre-collision assist and automatic emergency braking. The version we are driving has 4X2, 4X4 and 4-low modes, accessible via a dial. In addition, you can select various off-road modes: tow (which is new), slippery, mud and ruts, and sand. Do this and the display even pops up and tells you how the four-wheel-drive system is being optimised with locking diffs, à la Range Rover. The touchscreen has fan and temperature controls, but there is also a set of physical air-con control knobs and buttons. Twin gloveboxes, but plastic quality isn’t great. Narrow door pockets apart, storage and stowage are also decent. The square elbow box is huge, the twin gloveboxes manage a good amount of room between them and there are full-sized cup holders and a tray to keep knick knacks below the central console. The black on black dash, however, looks more utilitarian than upmarket, and plastic quality in and around the central console is only ordinary. Ford will certainly need a more upmarket version of the Everest for the Indian market. And while the digital instrument panel proffers up some great graphics, the ‘digital’ tachometer and small temperature, fuel and oil pressure gauges on the instrument panel need to be more legible. Come on Ford, this is easy. Space in the second row of the Everest is also improved. Legroom and even headroom are more than sufficient, and as the cabin is wider, there seems to be more space in general. The seat is set a bit low, so the seating position is a bit knees-up. You can, however, slide the second-row bench forwards or back and the backrest can be reclined as well. You also get a blower control in the back as well as a regular plug point, so you can charge or power even laptops. Even more space at rear, but seat is low. There’s also a bit more room in the third row, especially after optimising and adjusting the space used for the first and second row. Getting in isn’t easy, but once you are in, short journeys are sort of manageable.  What the Everest also gets, even three rows up, is a fair amount of boot space. You can stack around four pieces of hand baggage in the back or even two big bags. The third row seats can be folded electrically (up and down) for more space. Third row now gets a bit more space but small seats are still only for short drives or children.   Up where it belongs Ford’s new Everest is a full-size SUV that ticks almost every single checkbox. And it is a long list. Big, bold, spacious, comfortable and well-equipped, the new Everest is a large-sized body-on-frame SUV that delivers a solid build, real off-road ability and is practical. It is also refined, sophisticated, easy, effortless and enjoyable to drive. It drives so well, in fact, that it feels like it’s built on a monocoque chassis.  Then there’s the bi-turbo diesel, which is smooth, punchy and responsive. You do miss having paddle shifters, and Ford needs to look at a more upmarket version of the Everest, with a higher quality dash (in particular). But, be in no doubt Ford, when you eventually decide to make a return, this is the SUV to do it with.  FORD’S COMEBACK When will Ford return to India? This is a question that is difficult to answer. What we can tell you, however, is that Ford has held on to its plant in Chennai and is currently working on a plan to make a comeback. And from what we hear, the Everest is part of that plan. Ford is likely to assemble the car here in India, just as it did earlier, and it is also likely to use the Sanand-made diesel engine. There’s even a bi-turbo 3.0 V6 diesel that makes 250hp and 600Nm of torque if Ford wants to get the Everest in as an import, and that sure will get the attention of SUV lovers.

    "description": "The new Renault Duster has been finally spotted on Indian soil almost a year after its global debut. Expected to go on sale in the second half of 2025, the new Duster will be pitted against segment heavyweights like the Hyundai Creta, Kia Seltos, Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara and Toyota Hyryder, among others. Duster will be the first of four SUVs to launch in India It will sit on the modular CMF-B platform The engine line-up will be petrol-only Renault Duster line-up to have four SUVs in total Renault’s alliance partner, Nissan, will also have its own version of the Duster, which will have cosmetic differences and Nissan styling cues to maintain its unique brand identity. Last year, the brands confirmed the India launch of these models, which will also be exported. At that time, Renault had previewed the Duster via teaser.  The teaser had confirmed that the Duster for India will have some styling differences from the one sold abroad, with the front grille having a large Renault logo instead of Renault lettering as seen on models sold overseas. On the other hand, the yet-to-be-revealed Nissan SUV will come with L-shaped connected LED daytime running lamps with a light bar running across the nose. Additionally, there are plans to introduce the seven-seat versions of these SUVs in future, starting with the already-revealed Renault Bigster. These models will rival the likes of the other three-row midsize SUVs, including the Hyundai Alcazar, MG Hector Plus, Tata Safari and Mahindra XUV700. The three-row iterations of the two SUVs will likely have some distinctive styling elements and a slightly longer wheelbase but might carry over the same powertrain(s). All four SUVs will sit on the Renault-Nissan alliance CMF-B platform, which will be tweaked for markets like India. The SUV will be heavily localised right from the start in order to achieve competitive pricing. In order to achieve greater economies of scale, these SUVs will also be exported to multiple overseas markets. Renault Nissan SUVs to have petrol engines only These SUVs will likely have the 1.3-litre HR13 turbo-petrol engine, which churns out 156hp. In India, this unit was also seen in the previous-gen Nissan Kicks and the Mercedes A-Class sedan. The Duster line-up could also have a 1.0-litre turbo-petrol mill from the Kiger and Magnite, with power bumped up slightly. Additionally, there are talks of a 1.5-litre naturally aspirated petrol for entry-level variants.  All four SUVs will be petrol-only, and there are no plans to bring back the popular K9K diesel engine that powered the previous Duster and Terrano in India. New Renault Duster, Nissan SUV India launch timeline Renault and Nissan’s Creta rivals will be launched first, followed by their 7-seater versions. Renault and Nissan have together confirmed that both SUVs will be introduced in close succession, and this new product introduction will kick off by late 2025 in India.

    "description": "Bentley will unveil its first electric vehicle, an urban SUV, by 2026. This model will be one of the 10 EV and plug-in hybrid models to be launched by Bentley in the next decade. It will be one of 10 EV and plug-in hybrid models to be launched in the space of a decade. New Bentley SUV to sit below Bentayga Will share PPE architecture with other VW group SUVs Will be under five meters long Bentley electric SUV: what does the teaser show? Along with a preview sketch hinting at the car’s roofline, Bentley has described the vehicle, which it will reveal in 2026 and launch the following year, as “the world’s first true luxury urban SUV”, adding that it will create an “entirely new segment”. The model will be designed, developed and produced at Bentley’s Crewe factory. This confirms our sister publication Autocar UK’s earlier reports that the new EV will be a “segment-straddling crossover”. It will also be less than five metres long, making it Bentley's smallest vehicle to date. The new luxury electric SUV would effectively be positioned below the Bentayga. This new SUV will sit on the Volkswagen Group’s PPE bespoke electric platform, which has been co-developed by Audi and Porsche and is used on the Audi Q6 e-tron and Porsche Macan Electric. This could hint at the broad size and performance of the Bentley EV. However, speaking to Autocar UK, new Bentley boss Frank-Steffen Walliser said  – who previously worked at Porsche – it would be “completely wrong” for Bentley to develop a model that was “anything like” one that the Stuttgart-based firm would produce.  The PPE platform allows for a range of layouts, including single- and twin-motor options, the latter offering all-wheel drive. It can also accept a range of battery sizes and motor types, while its 800V architecture enables ultra-fast charging. Bentley design chief Robin Page has already said the new model will retain many of the firm’s historic design cues while featuring a new front-end design to reflect the lack of a combustion engine. Extensive offerings from Bentley’s Mulliner customisation division are also likely to be key to making the model a true luxury car. Notably, the decision to produce an ‘urban SUV’ distances Bentley’s first EV from new electric rivals such as the Rolls-Royce Spectre coupe.

    "link": "",
    "description": "Photography by: Zach Brehl (@zachbrehl) 1986 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole (QV) Location: Toronto, Ontario Country of original delivery: Canada Chassis/VIN: GLA12978 Mileage: 25,334 kms (15,742 miles) Certification : Polo Storico Certification Price: Call for Price     The Car | The 1st nut-and-bolt restoration undertaken by Lamborghini As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer this highly storied, two-owner, factory-restored, US-specification 1986 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole. Believed to be the first nut-and-bolt restoration project ever undertaken by Lamborghini, years before the creation of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015, this Countach LP5000 QV represents a unique chapter in Lamborghini history. This 1986 Countach Quattrovalvole, finished in Rosso over Champagne with a Brown dashboard, was originally delivered on April 17, 1986, to a dealership called Autolynn in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. It was equipped with fuel injection to comply with North American emissions regulations and featured USA-specific bumpers. In the summer of 1988, the car was owned by a real estate agent who, after an afternoon drive, parked it in his driveway. Later that day, smoke began to emanate from the engine bay, ultimately igniting a fire that damaged the engine, body panels, and interior, scorching the seats and causing significant smoke damage. Deemed a write-off by the insurance company due to the scarcity and cost of replacement parts, the car seemed destined for obscurity—until the current custodian, a Canadian collector with a deep passion for the Countach, entered the picture. The search for parts was arduous. “I called every Lamborghini dealer in North America, faxed lists, and made countless calls, only to be told that parts were unavailable or would take months to arrive,” the owner recounted. “The factory had shifted focus to the new Diablo, making Countach components nearly impossible to find.” Then, an unexpected call came from a Toronto lawyer representing Lamborghini. The company, aware of his search through multiple inquiries across North America, wanted to inspect the salvaged parts. By 1989, he shipped the car to Milan. Lamborghini’s sales manager, Ubaldo Sgarzi, responded within a week of the car's arrival, confirming receipt and outlining plans to prepare an estimate for the restoration. With the production line for the Countach already dismantled, many parts had to be handmade or specially ordered from original suppliers. The extensive project took two and a half years and cost over USD $240,000— $30,000 more than the price of a new Diablo at the time. “The documentation is immense,” says the owner. Invoices, receipts, and correspondence attest to what was essentially a full rebuild. This restoration stands as a landmark: the first comprehensive restoration carried out by Lamborghini itself, years before the establishment of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015.   Continue...",

Somehow, the leaf wraps its desiccated body around the windshield wiper arm. I can smell its dry, brittle scent. The smell of autumn. I suddenly had a thought. “Was that the last auto event for the season?” Rewind back 7 hours. Let's go back to the beginning. The event in mention is the annual 28 Liberty car show, hosted by Carpark in the financial district of Manhattan. Like many other Carpark events, organizers Rob Blackman, Jeffrey Einhorn, and Liz Gilchrist create a show that is as much a celebration of the cars as it is a gathering of people. In Jeff’s own words, ‘a three-dimensional event’. With food, wine, cars, and even a marching brass band, there aren’t many events that have the same milieu.
