    "description": "This 1957 Porsche 356A Carrera is a GS “de Luxe” coupe that was completed on January 15, 1957, before being sold new by Competition Motors in Hollywood, California. The car is said to have been purchased in California in 1975 by its then-19-year-old owner, whose 45-year stewardship included a refurbishment in the 1980s and a 2010 mechanical refresh that included the installation of a replacement 1.5-liter Type 547/1 four-cam flat-four. In 2020, the car underwent an additional refurbishment that included a repaint in the original shade of silver and a re-trim of the interior in red leatherette. Additional features include a roller-bearing crankshaft, dry-sump lubrication, twin Solex carburetors, a four-speed manual transaxle, four-wheel drum brakes, Koni shock absorbers, 15” chrome wheels, and a Blaupunkt push-button radio. Following award-winning appearances at both the 2023 Amelia and 2023 Hilton Head Concours d’Elegances, the car was listed on BaT in October 2024 before being purchased by the current owner. This Carrera GS is now offered on dealer consignment in California with a copy of its Kardex, a Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, a Reutter Certificate of Production, invoices from engine and transaxle work, awards, and a clean Montana title in the owner's name.",

    "description": "Ever since it came out in 2022, the Hunter 350 has been a runaway success for Royal Enfield. And it's not hard to see why - it's a stylish, well built and reasonably affordable entry point into one of the most aspirational brands in our market. But that's not to say it was a perfect machine and it did have one significant flaw. Recently, Royal Enfield updated the Hunter with changes that kept customer feedback in mind. So, are the Hunter’s drawbacks a thing of the past now?  Royal Enfield Hunter 350 suspension and ride comfort - 8/10 New shocks offer noticeable improvement in ride comfort What was perhaps the biggest problem on the Hunter (and a number of recent Royal Enfield launches) - the stiff rear suspension. For 2025, the company has replaced the earlier model’s linear springs with these progressive units you see here. And in a word, the effect they've had on the ride quality is landmark!  New progressive springs have transformed the Hunter's ride quality. Whether you're going over big potholes that have started appearing now that the monsoon is here or you're tackling high frequency recurring bumps like thickly painted rumble strips, this rear suspension keeps you reasonably comfortable. Do bear in mind, it's not suddenly become as thoroughly plush as a Classic 350 but the ride comfort on the Hunter is no longer the dealbreaker it once was.  The Hunter's ride quality is no longer the dealbreaker it once was. Even when you’re just sitting on a static bike, you can feel the suspension sagging a little, unlike the previous model. And when you’re tackling uneven patchwork, big potholes, jarring concrete and the myriad of road imperfections that Mumbai’s road infrastructure is littered with, you’re no longer wincing in pain while getting tossed out of the seat like on the older bike. The good news for existing Hunter owners is that you can retrofit these new shocks to an older bike and have this same level of comfort.   Royal Enfield Hunter 350 clutch effort - 9/10 New slip/assist clutch greatly reduces clutch effort, helpful in city traffic Another pain point on the earlier Hunter was its heavy clutch pull, especially inside staccato big city traffic. Royal Enfield has remedied this problem by giving the latest model a slip/assist clutch which has greatly reduced the effort needed to pull in the clutch lever. While it is much lighter (thankfully!) it still has a decent amount of feel. This is especially important because the new riders this bike is aimed at can be deterred by a heavy clutch pull. Slip/assist clutch greatly reduces effort needed to pull the clutch lever, helpful in long traffic jams. And another little cherry atop this cake is that this lighter clutch action will soon be common across RE’s 350cc lineup as they will all be updated with this same slip/assist clutch in the coming months.  More good news is that just like the new suspension units, you can also retrofit this slip/assist clutch to existing Royal Enfield 350cc models. It might not be cheap to do so, but if you spend a lot of time stuck in traffic, your left forearm will thank you for it.  Royal Enfield Hunter 350 ride and handling - 8/10 It's wonderfully agile yet never feels unstable  Aside from these two changes, the Hunter is mostly the same as it's always been although there are a few small updates that we’ll talk about further down. This is an accessible and fun machine, and even more so now with our few earlier complaints being addressed.  The Hunter is an agile machine but isn't overly reactive. The best way to describe the Hunter’s demeanour is to say that it is an agile yet surefooted and confidence inspiring machine but not an overly eager one. And that's okay because this is meant to be a relaxed roadster at the end of the day.  Royal Enfield Hunter 350 seating comfort - 9/10 Despite its small size, it is roomy for taller riders While it is a compact machine, it's not cramped even for larger riders although with a pillion onboard, it can get a little tight. The company tells us that the handlebar is now a little closer to the rider than before and the seat foam’s density has been reworked, although seat height remains the same at 790mm. The reason behind making these changes has been to improve rider comfort over longer stints in the saddle. Truth be told, the difference is minimal and it's something most riders aren’t likely to notice.  Despite its diminutive size, the Hunter can seat taller riders comfortably. And while it's not aimed at doing long stints in the saddle, you can take the Hunter on longer trips without too much hassle.One change that's sure to help on our unpredictable roads, especially when riding two up or with luggage is the added ground clearance (now up by 10mm to a total of 160mm) Royal Enfield has liberated by rerouting the exhaust piping.  Seat foam density is now revised for added comfort. Royal Enfield Hunter 350 engine sound and refinement - 9/10 Characterful, smooth and torquey, the RE 350cc motor is an absolute peach  One very compelling reason you'd want to take the Hunter on longer rides is that charming engine. It's torquey, smooth, characterful and has a lovely exhaust note to accompany you on your getaways. It remains unchanged with the same 20hp and 27Nm as before. While those numbers aren't spectacular, its the way the torque is delivered, the gentle thump at low speeds and how the motor is absolutely calm at 80-90kph with just a slight pulse through the touch points that makes you want to take the longer route to your destination.  The Hunter's exhaust note also sounds remarkably different to the other 350s and has more of a fast-paced beat to suit its demeanour than its more relaxed siblings.  Royal Enfield Hunter 350 headlight performance - 7/10 New LED headlight looks good but its performance is rather average The final change on the Hunter 350 is the LED headlight and this is the same unit that has come from the shared RE parts bin. The previous model’s halogen setup worked well at lighting up a dark road and this new LED headlight provides rather average illumination in comparison to it. That being said, from a purely visual standpoint, the LED suits the modern look of the Hunter more than the earlier bulb headlight. LED headlight looks good but illumination is adequate and is the same as almost every other RE. Royal Enfield Hunter 350 price and verdict - 9/10 Lot of changes for a small increase in price, its a properly compelling option now Summing up, the Hunter 350 is now a really sorted machine and the best part is that Royal Enfield has only increased the price by Rs 7,000 for the mid and top variants, while keeping the starting price the same as it was before. As before, the difference between the mid and top versions is only in the colour schemes. Meanwhile, the base bike has simpler switchgear, wire spoked wheels with tubed tyres and single-channel ABS owing to the rear drum brake. The Hunter is a stylish and well-built machine. With this update, most of the Hunter’s flaws have been ironed out and it's encouraging to see a big company like Royal Enfield address customer feedback so comprehensively. As it stands today, the Hunter is one of the most compelling options in its class and it will surely become an even bigger success for Royal Enfield.  Also See: 2025 Royal Enfield Hunter 350 video review",

    "description": "Ten well-heeled customers will take delivery of the world's ultimate track day car, with its screaming V12 Aston Martin has launched the Valkyrie LM as a screaming V12-engined, Le Mans-spec track toy that could be the world's ultimate automotive plaything.   Unlike the Valkyrie AMR Pro, a track-only version of the Valkyrie road car, the Valkyrie LM is based on Aston's LMH hypercar that will race at La Sarthe this weekend. That means it draws 697bhp from the same 6.5-litre Cosworth V12 and drives the rear wheels through a seven-speed semi-automatic sequential gearbox. But Aston Martin has made a number of modifications to tailor the Valkyrie LM to track day use, starting with making the V12 compatible with readily available fuel. It has also removed the ballast and FIA-regulation electronic systems, along with the racer's torque sensors.  Otherwise, though, this is a top-class Le Mans car that can be run around a track of its owner's choosing. It still has a carbonfibre race seat with six-point harness, a fire suppression system and bespoke track tyres from Pirelli. Adam Carter, Aston Martin’s head of endurance motorsport, said: “It is important to emphasise that the Valkyrie LM is close to identical to the race car that is currently competing in WEC and IMSA, with only a few minor deviations to ensure it is a non-homologated variant and is accessible for customers to experience and enjoy. \"Valkyrie LM represents the most authentic hypercar track experience that is now available.” Similarly to Ferrari's original XX track car programme, Aston Martin will store and transport the cars as part of a support programme for owners that aims to offer the \"ultimate top-flight motorsport experience\". Included as part of that, the company will also supply a team of engineers to set up the car and maintain it during the track days. It will also provide professional driver coaches and simulator sessions to ensure customers can \"explore the limits of a machine designed to operate in excess of 200mph on the fast, flat-out kinks of the most famous race track in the world\". Owners will be able to drive their cars for the first time at an \"exclusive handover event\" in the second quarter of 2026, before being invited to track days at Formula 1-standard circuits later in the year.",

    "description": "The renamed compact executive car's line-up expands with a new E-hybrid PHEV powertrain You can now buy a new Audi A5 Avant, and that’s neither a typo nor the promise of some sort of coupé-based shooting brake.Audi briefly decided to shake up its model-naming structure so that all the odd-numbered cars had combustion engines while all the even-numbered cars had batteries and electric motors. But after the move proved generally confusing, it has already ditched that approach – although it won't rename models already released, so some oddities remain.This means that, after being known as the 80 for 25 years and the A4 for 20 years, Audi’s compact executive saloon/estate now prefers to be known as the A5 – and, as per tradition, there’s a faster Audi S5 version, which we've reviewed separately.There's also a new plug-in hybrid powertrain, which will carry the new E-hybrid label. Audi says the branding is designed to make the new PHEVs “recognisable at first glance”. We're not fully sure it does, but it's definitely a welcome step forward compared with the whole odd/even thing and Audi's previous model-numbering system that was so loosely related to power output that it rivalled Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariff equation for befuddling opaqueness.",

    "description": "Hyundai is set to bolster the upper end of its Indian product line-up with the launch of the Palisade SUV in 2028, Autocar India can exclusively confirm. Much like the Hyundai Bayon compact SUV, the Palisade is yet another global model that the Korean carmaker plans to introduce in India by 2030 as part of an aggressive 26 product launch onslaught. Where the Bayon will compete with the Maruti Suzuki Fronx, though, the Palisade will slot in as Hyundai’s flagship model for India. Hyundai Palisade to launch in India with 2.5-litre petrol-hybrid powertrain The SUV gets a boxy and unique design with slatted headlights and tail-lamps Cabin gets dual-screen setup, 14-speaker Bose sound system, panoramic sunroof, etc Hyundai Palisade hybrid powertrain details 1,015km claimed driving range The Palisade debuts Hyundai’s next-gen hybrid powertrain, which will be offered with either a 2.5-litre 4-cylinder turbo-petrol or 1.6-litre 4-cylinder turbo-petrol engine. Owing to the Palisade’s size, the SUV utilises the former setup and ekes out a combined output of 334hp and 460Nm, with a maximum fuel efficiency of 14.1kpl and total driving range of 1,015km (claimed figures). Compared to a standalone 2.5-litre petrol engine, Hyundai claims that the Palisade’s hybrid setup delivers uplifts of 45 percent in efficiency, 19 percent in power, and 9 percent in peak torque. It’s worth noting that Hyundai also sells the Palisade with a 290hp, 353Nm, 3.5-litre petrol V6 in overseas markets, but we expect it to come solely with the hybrid powertrain in India. A 6-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive layout are standard on the Palisade hybrid, but Hyundai offers all-wheel drive as an option too. The SUV also gets three drive modes - Eco, Sport, and My Drive - and three terrain modes -  Mud, Snow, Sand. Hybrid setup enhances ride quality and handling Additionally, the Palisade’s hybrid powertrain brings improvements in vehicle dynamics. It enables an electrically-controlled ride comfort system dubbed ‘e-Comfort Drive’, which can reduce vertical movement when the Palisade goes over a speedbreaker and keeps body motion in check during acceleration. Handling is aided via the ‘e-Dynamic Drive’ system, which encompasses three features named e-DTVC (brakes and electric motor apply torque vectoring in steering direction while cornering to reduce understeer), e-EHA (motor maximises grip during sudden steering input to reduce skidding), and e-Handling (torque is dynamically adjusted while cornering to improve traction and stability). Hyundai Palisade exterior design Distinctive and squared-off styling echoes Range Rover The latest-gen Palisade first broke cover in December 2024, and much like prior iterations, it’s a large SUV with imposing design flourishes - albeit with boxier Range Rover-esque proportions this time. Notable styling elements on the new Palisade include a vertically-slatted arrangement for the LED headlights and tail-lamps, wide grille, 21-inch 15-spoke alloy wheels, and silver finish for the body cladding, D-pillars, and roof rails. Hyundai Palisade interior and features Three-row layout, second row captain seats also available Inside, the Palisade comes with a three-row layout that can accommodate up to eight occupants, but for buyers looking to maximise comfort in the middle, Hyundai optionally offers reclinable second-row captain seats with deployable footrests. The dashboard is dominated by a dual-screen setup comprising a 12.3-inch infotainment system and 12.3-inch digital driver’s display, with a three-spoke steering wheel in front of the latter. Fingerprint sensor in centre console can start the engine There are lots of physical controls on the Palisade’s centre console for the media system and HVAC functions, and moving further down reveals a large armrest, sizable storage space, and a wireless charging slot. Interestingly, the Palisade also gets a fingerprint sensor on the centre console that can start the engine and enable valet mode, among other functions. Other goodies included with the Palisade are a rear parking camera cleaning system, digital key, 360-degree camera, panoramic sunroof, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, powered seats with heating and cooling, 14-speaker Bose sound system, vehicle-to-load (V2L) functionality, ADAS suite, built-in dashcam, and more. Hyundai Palisade price in India May fall in the Rs 40-50 lakh range thanks to localisation Once it arrives in India, the Palisade could be priced in the Rs 50 lakh (ex-showroom) ballpark, as we understand that Hyundai is looking to localise the SUV here and export it to other markets. The current US prices for the Palisade start at $36,800 - approximately Rs 31.60 lakh - which lends further credence to the expected price point.

Upcoming Hyundai Bayon to utilise brand-new 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine Hyundai will build the engine in India; it will be hybrid-ready and stronger than 1.0 turbo The Bayon may offer both the 1.2-litre and 1.0-litre turbo-petrol powertrains Hyundai Bayon engine and gearbox New Hyundai 1.2-litre engine to slot in between carmaker's current turbo motors Earlier today, we broke the news of Hyundai developing a new locally-built 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine for the Indian market, which will slot in between the Korean carmaker’s current 1.0-litre turbo-petrol (used in the Venue and i20) and the 1.5-litre turbo-petrol (used in the Creta, Verna, and Alcazar) units. This 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine will offer greater torque and drivability than the 1.0-litre unit (120hp, 172Nm), whilst being more compact and fuel-efficient than the 1.5-litre motor (160hp, 253Nm). It’s also being engineered to be hybrid-ready, and so will likely be crucial to Hyundai’s future hybrid powertrains. As it stands, the transmission options for the 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine could include a dual-clutch automatic or an e-CVT, depending upon the use case. Bayon could get both 1.2-litre and 1.0-litre turbo-petrol engines According to our sources, the new engine is expected to power the 2026-bound Hyundai Bayon, as well as future iterations of the i20, Venue, and other models that fall in the Rs 15-20 lakh price bracket. Hyundai is gearing up to launch the next-gen Venue in October 2025, so it remains to be seen if the 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine debuts with the compact SUV. The Bayon is available with the 1.0-litre turbo-petrol engine with a 6-speed manual and 7-speed DCT in overseas markets, so these powertrains may be offered in the India-spec version as well. Hyundai Bayon exterior design Sleek and futuristic styling Up front, the Bayon’s styling closely resembles that of the Verna, thanks to a split-headlight setup comprising an LED strip on the bonnet and angular main units underneath. There’s also a wide honeycomb-patterned air dam, with silver trim and black plastic cladding that wraps all around the body. Over to the side, the Bayon gets 17-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels and several cuts and creases, and at the rear, the compact SUV has a blacked-out section housing rakish boomerang-shaped tail-lamps connected by an LED strip, with indicators, black cladding, and silver trim on the bumper. Hyundai Bayon interior and features 10.25-inch infotainment screen, Bose sound system, and more The Bayon’s all-black cabin shares a lot of components with Hyundai models, such as the familiar four-spoke steering wheel, 10.25-inch infotainment touchscreen, 10.25-inch digital driver’s display, HVAC control panel, etc. Other creature comforts include wireless charging, connected car tech, over-the-air (OTA) updates, fast-charging USB Type-C ports, ambient lighting, ADAS, an 8-speaker Bose sound system, and more. The Bayon also gets a 411-litre boot. Also see: Hyundai India's 26 product launch onslaught by 2030 decoded New Hyundai Verna SX+ trim launched at Rs 13.79 lakh",

If modern café racers are more your thing, we have a Honda CB550 from The Netherlands and a Ducati SportClassic from Australia to sate that appetite. 2026 KTM 450 Rally Replica The biggest news from KTM’s camp recently was the massive cash injection from its long-standing partner, Bajaj, that brought it back from the brink of bankruptcy. But despite the rollercoaster that the embattled Austrian marque has been on, it hasn’t skipped a beat with new product releases. KTM’s newest release is good news for privateer rally racers; the 2026 KTM 450 Rally Replica is here, and it’s as desirable as ever. For the uninitiated, the KTM 450 Rally Replica is the physical embodiment of the brand’s slogan, ‘Ready to Race.’…",

    "description": "Taking on someone else’s motorcycle project is a gamble. Low prices can lull you into a false sense of security, especially when you’re motivated and capable—two qualities that Gas \u0026 Oil Bespoke Motorcycles have in abundance. Polished, high-end custom motorcycles are Gas \u0026 Oil’s usual fare, so this fantastically filthy Honda XL500 flat tracker is a little left field for them. It was originally delivered to their Prague workshop in numerous boxes, but because it was an XL500 and the price was right, shop boss Matěj Sysel bought it. As soon as the basket case was spread out on the workshop floor, the team experienced the more painful side of buying an unfinished project; numerous parts were broken or missing. With this realization, the excitement of a new project waned, and the Honda XL500 was mothballed until they could decide what to do with it.…",

    "description": "The Land Rover Defender Octa made landfall in India last month with a starting price of Rs 2.59 crore (ex-showroom), while the limited-run ‘Edition One’ is tagged at Rs 2.79 crore. It is not just the most powerful and extreme Defender ever built but also the most expensive. In fact, it costs a hefty Rs 1.07 crore more than the Defender V8, previously the priciest variant at Rs 1.52 crore. But make no mistake: this isn’t just another cosmetic special or a new trim line with a catchy name. The Octa has been thoroughly re-engineered from the ground up. The familiar supercharged 5.0-litre V8 has been swapped for the BMW-sourced 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 paired with mild-hybrid tech, which has also been used by Range Rover. It produces a colossal 635hp and a maximum 800Nm of torque – figures that place it squarely in the realm of high-performance SUVs. Land Rover claims it will accelerate from 0 to 100kph in just 4 seconds. We’ve driven the Octa in the wilds of South Africa, but how does it fare in the ‘wilds’ of India? This is a very different kind of jungle. One where deep potholes can swallow a wheel, monsoon-induced craters appear overnight thanks to shoddy roadwork, and unmarked speed breakers can launch you skyward. Axle-twisting ruts left behind by overloaded trucks and the unpredictability of two-wheelers weaving through traffic only add to the madness. 2025 Defender Octa exterior design and engineering In conditions like these, what you need most is ground clearance, and the Octa has that in abundance. With a towering 323mm of clearance in its highest setting, this brute can crawl over almost anything. A class-leading water-wading depth of 1 metre means you won’t think twice about driving through a flooded Mumbai street in peak monsoon. No road is too tough for the Octa, thanks to its immense ground clearance. Height is the Octa’s most dramatic dimension. It stands 28mm taller and 68mm wider than a standard Defender 110, its bulging arches stretched to accommodate serious rubber. In South Africa, we tested it with aggressive off-road tyres; our India-spec test vehicle, however, had equally chunky BF Goodrich Trail-Terrain rubber. These 275/60 R20 tyres form a strong line of defence against bad roads, with ultra-tall sidewalls and tough construction that shrugs off sharp edges and potholes. This is the Defender dialled up to eleven. The Octa gets a unique grille, reinforced bumpers, a solid metal bash plate and four exhaust pipes poking out the rear. Even the traditional Land Rover badge gives way to a geometric Octa logo – a nod to the octahedron, the shape of a diamond and a symbol of strength. The Edition One, finished in a stunning Faroe Green and loaded with every optional extra, is for those who want true exclusivity. Naturally, that sort of statement doesn’t come cheap – Rs 2.79 crore, to be exact. 2025 Defender Octa interior space and comfort Octa-specific 14-way adjustable seats hug you for a secure ride. When you want to enter the cabin, that added height does have a drawback. Even with the air suspension dropped to its lowest setting, the cabin is still a climb. The grab handle on the dashboard, rather than the A-pillar, doesn’t offer ideal leverage either. But once you’re inside, the commanding driving position and panoramic visibility make you feel like you own the road. The high-set rear seat is comfortable, but getting in and out is tricky. Access to the rear seat is a bit easier thanks to a well-placed handle, but elderly passengers – or anyone in a saree – will still struggle with the ingress and egress. The back seat is high-set, generously cushioned and very comfortable, with good space even for three abreast. Open the side-hinged tailgate, spare wheel and all, and there’s a generous luggage area that completes the Octa’s family credentials. Generous storage space with rubberised surfaces for added practicality.   2025 Defender Octa features and safety kit Infotainment system brims with performance stats and real-time data. Inside, the Octa retains the Defender’s signature blend of ruggedness and refinement – but with a sporty twist. The 14-way adjustable front sport seats are upholstered in a mix of leather and Ultra fabric, a tough, lightweight, weather-resistant material that shrugs off heat, sweat, dust and monsoon muck. So, yes, you can climb in soaking wet with a muddy dog and not worry. But let’s be honest; in India, most Octa owners won’t stray far from the tarmac or risk dirtying their designer loafers. Exclusive Edition One features carbon-fibre trim for a touch of luxury. The Khaki-Ebony theme in the Edition One, contrasted with carbon-fibre accents and unique upholstery patterns, sets it apart from the standard Defender cabin. Octa-specific touches include new display graphics, performance menus and a dedicated ‘Octa’ mode button on the steering wheel. In Octa mode, the gearshift paddles light up, adding a sporty touch. Tech-wise, the Octa runs the latest generation of JLR’s infotainment system – slick, intuitive and enriched with drive-specific features. Crucially, Land Rover hasn’t sacrificed usability for form. Important controls, like those for the HVAC system, are still managed via physical dials and buttons, not buried in menus. 2025 Defender Octa performance and refinement Defender Octa Edition One performance as testedAcceleration (kph)Time (seconds)0-200.880-401.730-602.580-803.610-1004.750-1206.2620-80 (in kickdown)3.0240-100 (in kickdown)3.31 Driving something that costs north of Rs 3 crore through Mumbai’s chaotic traffic should be nerve-racking, but the Defender Octa flips that script. Its sheer presence parts traffic like Moses did the Red Sea. Smaller vehicles keep their distance, and that, in itself, reduces stress. You sit high, with excellent all-round visibility, and with 750Nm of torque at your command, overtakes are effortless (the maximum torque is 800Nm in the Dynamic launch mode). The Octa rides beautifully over Mumbai’s patchy roads – firm but never harsh. Unlike traditional ladder-frame off-roaders like the G-Wagen or Wrangler, the Octa doesn’t toss you around or feel unwieldy. On the newly opened AtalSetu, Mumbai’s 22-km trans-harbour sea link, the Octa finally stretches its legs. Floor the throttle, and the 4.4-litre V8 responds with a refined snarl piped through the quad exhausts. It’s not as loud or dramatic as the outgoing supercharged V8 or AMG’s thunderous G63, but it is potent. BMW-sourced 4.4-litre V8 churns out 635hp and 800Nm of torque. We timed a 0-100kph sprint in 4.7 seconds, slightly off the claimed time but still blisteringly quick for a 2.5-tonne SUV. What’s more impressive is how flat and composed the Octa feels at speed. There’s little roll or pitch, and the body control is astonishing for something this tall. 2025 Defender Octa ride comfort and handling On the sinuous Lonavala Ghat section of the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, the Octa corners with confidence; the quick and accurate steering lets you change direction confidently. However, you do feel the mass and height when quickly transitioning through a series of corners, and the tall all-terrain tyres blunt the steering response. The thing is that the Octa goads you to push it hard, to drive fast, and at high speeds, you might spot potholes too late. But instead of swerving to avoid them, the Octa, without flinching, can just drive through them as if they don’t exist. The Octa’s real ace is its trick new suspension. Called 6D Dynamics, this advanced setup uses hydraulically linked dampers in place of traditional anti-roll bars, allowing it to control pitch and roll in real time. The Octa is a long-distance champion, effortlessly covering miles, no matter the surface. On Indian roads, it’s a revelation. Over rough patches, potholes and speed breakers, the Octa doesn’t bounce, lurch or feel unsettled like a typical tall SUV. It isn’t as plush as a Range Rover, which cocoons you from the outside world, but it strikes a near-perfect balance between feedback and comfort. You feel the road beneath you – but you don’t suffer it. We peel off the highway past Lonavala, heading towards Nanoli. This is rural Maharashtra, where the roads are narrow, the tarmac is patchy, and life slows down. Well, not quite. The Octa seems to thrive in these backwaters. You sit high, steering around goats, cyclists and the occasional overambitious biker, and that sense of control never fades. On these narrow roads, it is common to drop the inside two wheels off the road and onto the earthen shoulders to give way to oncoming traffic. In the Octa, you can do that without slowing down. Nothing – absolutely nothing – catches the Octa out. If anything, the Octa makes rural motoring feel almost luxurious. We reach the still-under-construction Nanoli Speedway. It’s a mud-laced ribbon of what will soon be a world-class racetrack. But for now, it’s a gravel racetrack, a loose surface for some high-speed antics. This is the time to switch to Octa mode and switch off the traction control. The Octa is shockingly easy to drift and slide like a rally car. The sense of control and the confidence you get flicking this massive SUV around the 3km dirt track make you feel like a Dakar champion. You finish the session not sweaty and tired but with the cooled seats on and your favourite music playing. 2025 Defender Octa price and verdict Unsurprisingly, Land Rover is gunning squarely for the Mercedes-AMG G 63 with the Rs 2.59 crore-2.79 crore Octa. The G 63, with its powerful and glorious-sounding V8, might still have more street cred and an irresistible charm that has won it a legion of fans, but it’s nowhere near as capable or rounded a car as the Octa, which does practically everything better. Other performance SUVs, such as the Porsche Cayenne or Lamborghini Urus, exist, but they’re far more road-biased and can’t take a serious bashing – especially with their low-profile tyres. That’s why the Octa stands in a league of its own: equally at ease navigating the chaotic sprawl of Mumbai, drifting sideways down a gravel road, tackling remote Ladakhi tracks, or wading through a metre-deep river. Yes, it’s super expensive, but for those who can afford it, the Octa is luxury with a wild streak – built not just to survive India’s roads but to dominate them.

    "description": "This feels familiar. This time last year, I was right here, at the CoASTT high-performance centre, sweltering heat searing my skin, with the keys to a 911 in my hands. I was giddy with excitement then, and I am once again now. The difference is that last year, I had for company what I consider the pinnacle of modern 911 engineering, the mighty GT3 RS, and as the Porsche nerds among you know, that version comes near the end of the car’s mid-life cycle. So now the model range has been reset, and we’ve gone from the top of the pecking order back down to the bottom with this 992.2 Carrera. Porsche 911 Carrera exterior design and engineering Only aficionados will spot the wider LEDs that mark out the 992.2. Don’t let the dramatic wing fool you – this isn’t a GT3 but rather a Rs 11 lakh aero kit option.In fact, in classic Porsche fashion, there are a lot of options you can add to your Carrera (this car has Rs 67 lakh worth) to help make it look, feel and perform better. But I’m here to tell you that, even if you don’t, through the power of immaculate engineering, you will still be in possession of one of the finest sports cars on the planet. DRLs, indicators moved into headlamp, so bumper is free for aero, cooling. One of the most underappreciated facets of a 911, I find, is how easy it is for anyone to just get in and go fast. Stepping in, it immediately feels welcoming and familiar. But even if you’ve never driven one before, the great forward visibility, thin A-pillars, visual markers in the form of the raised fenders, a driving position that’s not overly aggressive, a slim-rimmed steering wheel, and an uncluttered dashboard ease you in. Porsche 911 Carrera interior and features Like all modern cars, it too has succumbed to screens; the 10.9-inch touchscreen returns, and behind the steering wheel, the wonderful central analogue tachometer has met its inevitable demise, replaced by a full-digital screen. But even here, Porsche has to be applauded for keeping both screens simple, legible and free of distraction. Sacrilege! Iconic five dials go full digital but remain easy to read. The PCM (Porsche Communication Management; how German) 6.0 interface is one of the cleanest and least complicated while still being packed with features. And though they’ve gone digital, the dials still look like ‘dials’, albeit with a number of configurations, ranging from the classic 911 5-dial setup to a full map display. You can even reorient the tacho to have the redline at the top of the circle. Tactile, twist-to-start knob replaced by boring starter button. There are now no rear seats by default, but they can be optioned for no cost. However, a change I’m less enthused about is the switch from the twist-to-start ignition knob to a regular start/stop button; a small but annoying blow to driver involvement. Porsche 911 Carrera performance and refinement Porsche 911 Carrera specsLength/width/height 4582mm/1852mm/1302mm Wheelbase 2450mmEngineFlat-six, 2981cc, twin-turbo petrol Power 394hp at 7,500rpm Torque 450Nm at 2,000-5,000rpm Gearbox8-speed dual-clutch auto Kerb weight 1520kg 0-100kph 3.9 seconds (claimed)Economy 9.6kpl (WLTP) While on the topic, does choosing the ‘lowly’ Carrera rob you of even more driver involvement? The twin-turbo 3.0-litre flat-six certainly doesn’t disappoint. 394hp and 450Nm might sound meek in absolute sports car terms, but trust me when I say they’re more than plenty. Even out on the race track, where all but the fastest cars can feel slow, it never feels lacking. 911 hallmarks remain: great visibility, pointy front end, perfect driving position. Maybe it’s the tremendous sound from the optional sports exhaust, the instantaneous responses, or the ceaseless thrust you get all the way to 7,500rpm. It’s not the goosebump-inducing 4.0-litre naturally aspirated screamer you find in the GT3s, but it doesn’t fall far behind. You could even argue that its more accessible power makes it better for everyday use. Incidentally, compared to the old 992.1 Carrera, they didn’t just pump up the boost pressure and call it a day. It’s got different turbos, borrowed from the outgoing 911 GTS, and new intercoolers out of the Turbo S. Porsche 911 Carrera ride and handling Fantastic as the engine is, I’d argue that what truly makes a 911 is the chassis, and I’m happy to report that it is, as ever, impeccable. A downside is you can’t specify any handling-enhancing options on a Carrera, as you can on higher 911s. Adaptive dampers are standard, but not on the options menu are PDCC (active roll stabilisation), PCCB (carbon-ceramic brakes) or, most disappointingly, rear-wheel steering. Balanced as it is, a firm prod will swing its heavy rear around like a pendulum. So, it’s a testament to how solid the core setup is that it doesn’t suffer for this. 60 years of honing has turned an inherently unbalanced weight distribution into a deftly balanced one. It’s slightly pendulous, not overwhelmingly so, with the rear-engine layout helping the back of the car be a little livelier around corners. The steering has heft and is supremely communicative.  As ever, no engine weight at the front means the steering remains uncorrupted. It’s sharp, it’s got heft, and it is full of micro-communications fed directly to your palms. The car’s limits are high but also clearly spelled out, so as I approach them on the fast right-hander that is C1, I know almost instinctively how far down the throttle travel my foot has to be to induce some oversteer without overcooking it. You gotta love track time! Porsche 911 Carrera price and verdict Really, there’s nothing entry-level about the new Porsche 911 Carrera then. Certainly not its Rs 2.11 crore starting price (ex-showroom); that was how much a previous-gen Turbo cost when it was new. And, of course, once you start rummaging through the options list, the sky is the limit. The base Carrera offers 85 percent of the 911 experience.   Though we didn’t drive it on the road much, you already know what to expect there. The nose-lift kit is an essential option to tick. The ride quality is firm but compliant – stay away from the larger wheel size if that’s a concern. The front boot is more spacious than its 135 litres would suggest. But the simple fact that it’s got me grinning as wide as I was last year with the GT3 RS – and without pulverising me along the way – speaks volumes. It tells me that the humble Carrera is 85 percent of the way there, and moving up the range is an exercise in diminishing returns. That’s not to say you won’t get more out of a Turbo S or a GT3 or even a GTS t-hybrid; but rather that you can’t go wrong with any 911.
