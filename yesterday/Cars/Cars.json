    "description": "This 1963 Shelby Cobra is one of 126 Mark I examples produced and is said to have arrived in Los Angeles in the spring of 1963 before being invoiced to Coventry Motors of Walnut Creek, California, that June. Chassis 2095 was purchased from its first known owner in Oregon in 1972 by another Oregon owner before undergoing two color changes, the installation of a newer dual-carb engine, and the addition of fender flares and wider wheels over the ensuing decade. The car was purchased in 1981 by a steward who retained it for 20 years before it was sold in 2003 to a Florida owner who subsequently commissioned a refurbishment by marque specialist Mike McCluskey in California that included the removal of the fender flares. It was reportedly driven in various tours before being purchased by another owner in 2018 and then being sold to a Qatari collection in 2020. It was purchased by its current owner and relocated to Van Nuys, California, in 2024. Finished in black, the car is powered by a 289ci Ford V8 that is topped by twin Carter four-barrel carburetors and is mated to a four-speed manual transmission. Additional features include transverse leaf-spring suspension, worm-and-roller steering, four-wheel disc brakes, bright 15” wire wheels, a hood scoop, dual rear-exit exhaust with chrome tips, red leather upholstery, and a black convertible top with matching side curtains. This Cobra 289 is recorded in the 2019 SAAC registry and is now offered by the seller on behalf of its current owner with a tool kit and a clean California title.",

    "description": "Lexus changes hybrid tack in pursuit of driver appeal for its large SUV Car marques like Lexus haven’t typically been around long enough to have been involved in the conception of many current vehicle types – but, with the Lexus RX luxury SUV, Toyota’s premium brand does claim to have been something of a pioneer.When the first-generation Lexus RX was launched in 1998, what would become known as the luxury SUV market really only had ladder frame cars within it: the P38A Range Rover, the Mercedes M-Class and, in North America, the Lincoln Navigator. With its monocoque chassis and choice of either front- or four-wheel drive, however, the RX demonstrated how much bulk could be saved by adopting a more car-like construction. Later, in 2005, the RX also brought hybrid power to the class. In both senses, it has been one of the luxury SUV’s greater modernising influences.And now entering its fifth model generation, the RX is branching out. The V6 petrol engines that powered the car previously have been discarded, and new and more efficient four-cylinder units brought in. More interesting still, though, are the arrival of two all-new RX derivatives to sit alongside the familiar ‘self-charging’ petrol hybrid. The RX 450h+ plug-in hybrid is the one most will have seen coming, Lexus adopting and refining powertrain technology from the likes of the Toyota RAV4 PHEV.But the RX 500h is a Lexus like none we have seen before. It mates a turbocharged petrol engine with a six-speed automatic gearbox, discarding the CVT-style power splitter transmission that both Toyota and Lexus hybrids have always used, and adds a new torque-vectoring electric rear axle too.The RX 500h represents the first time that any Toyota or Lexus hybrid has prioritised either performance or driver engagement over outright efficiency, or sought to foster a deeper connection between driver and car.Range at a glanceLexus has slimmed and simplified its usual derivative structure for this new RX. Buyers first choose from regular 350h hybrid, 450h+ plug-in hybrid and range-topping 500h hybrid powertrains, each offering four-wheel drive.They can then opt for regular or Takumi trim with the lesser hybrids, or F Sport or Takumi in the 500h. A Premium Plus package is a de facto trim level on the 350h and 450h+.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/from-the-archive/story-behind-clay-modelling-and-why-its-still-used-today",
    "description": "Clay models have been shaping how cars look since the 1930s, as we discovered on a visit to Austin In an age when nearly everything we do relies on digital technology, clay models are still crucial for car designers. The reason is simply that while computer-aided design now leads to amazingly realistic 3D imagery, a physical manifestation of designers’ drawings is easier for them to visualise and evaluate. Clay modelling was introduced to the car industry way back in the 1930s by influential General Motors styling chief Harley Earl. Until then, car design had been a much more difficult and time-consuming affair of wood and metal. Clay modelling took on an even more important role as cars moved from body-on-frame to monocoque construction, as Autocar’s then technical editor Montague Tombs and technical artist Max Millar discovered on a 1945 visit to Longbridge, where the ‘back-room boys’ were hard at work on Austin’s first post-war models. “It is so easy for anyone to sit down and sketch out a ravishing two-seater sports car with an indefinite wheelbase and guesswork accommodation for human beings. \"But it requires real genius to lay out a practical four-seater saloon on a 7ft wheelbase and still contrive to make the result look universally attractive to the human eye,” wrote Tombs. He described the creative portion of the circa-four-year process, from the board asking for a new design to the first car leaving the factory. “The body designer (BD) starts by preparing a number of bold rough sketches, illustrating various styles and modes, from the orthodox with improvements to the futuristic. These sketches are considered by the management, and one or two will be selected for further development. Then the BD makes a first set of scale drawings, showing side, plan and end views. From this he develops his first scale drawings. “Actual modelling is the next step. Models to the same scale as the drawings are worked out in Plasticine and the curves denoted by the flat views are translated into surfaces which can be viewed from all angles. Enjoy full access to the complete Autocar archive at the magazineshop.com It is only in this way that the main proportions can be seen and balanced, and that the high lights can be seen and, if scattered, brought into continuity by a deft touch here and there. “Probably the BD will make half a dozen models for one design, with slight differences between them, in search for the happiest combinations. And he must not for one instant relax his attention to the irreducible dimensions of seating capacity, and of mechanism also, that lie beneath the surfaces. “And all the time the BD is working he has to bear in mind the possibilities of producing in sheet steel the curves he is outlining. “For a good many reasons connected with visibility and accessibility, the narrowing down of the heavy mass of a saloon body to a fine front, whilst not forgetting that the motoring world is still a trifle ‘radiator-conscious’, causes the treatment of the front end to become one of the most difficult parts of the design. For that reason, the front end of the model is often made detachable, and a series of different front ends can be applied. “When at last the BD has satisfied himself, the steel-pressing expert has given his blessing and the body-engineering chiefs have approved the main details, the sample models are submitted to the directors. \"Possibly every point they have in mind is not completely met and further modelling is necessary. In the end, a model is selected for development to the next stages. “A preliminary set of full-size scale drawings is prepared, from which a full-size ‘mock-up’ model will be made. It is made of timber, in blocks so put together that parts can be removed or reshaped. “When the mock-up has been gone over with a fine-tooth comb by everyone concerned, the heavy guns come into action. “The pressed-steel engineer takes a survey of all the panels, wings and other oddments, decides which can be made in a single pressing, which can be divided and where joined. “From this point, evolution goes over to the body drawing office, where complete sets of production drawings are made of every detail, large or small, for the whole job.” It’s amazing, really, that while everything in the car industry has changed a lot over the past 80 years, design is, in essence, as it ever was.",

We’re suckers for ultra-clean custom bikes that match timeless aesthetics to modern performance. It’s an art form that Filippo Barbacane is well versed in—as evidenced by this tastefully modded Moto Guzzi California. Filippo runs Officine Rossopuro on Italy’s Adriatic coast. Although the workshop doesn’t only work on Moto Guzzi restomods, the Italian V-twins do form the bulk of their output. So Filippo knows Moto Guzzi’s back catalog well—and, like any good Guzzista, the man has his favorites. “The idea came from the desire to create a sports cruiser based on a Moto Guzzi,” he says of this project. “The California was born as a cruiser, but it has always amazed me because of its rideability compared to other cruisers.…",

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-reviews/2025-ktm-390-adventure-review-second-times-the-charm-434691#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Bike+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "Five years after the launch of the original 390 Adventure, there’s a brand new one in town, and this time around, KTM have got it right. The new 390 ADV makes up for its predecessor's adventure-related shortcomings, and it manages to do so thanks to the all-new platform that debuted in the Gen 3 Duke. Everything that benefited the Duke does so here as well, including the side-slung monoshock and repositioned airbox, which have helped bring the seat height down from 855mm on the previous ADV to a more palatable 830mm. KTM 390 Adventure changes for 2025 But it's not just a lower seat height that takes the new 390 ADV a big step forward, because this bike now has more suspension travel (up from 170/177mm to 200/205mm), and it also has much more ground clearance (200-237mm). In fact, the design of the new 399cc engine also contributes to the ground clearance, thanks to a higher positioning for the crankshaft compared with the old 373cc motor. So, in many ways, the new-gen 399cc platform shines brightest when it comes to the ADV and its Enduro/SMC siblings. With 46hp and 39Nm, the motor makes the same numbers as the 390 Duke, but it gets a bigger 46-teeth rear sprocket (up by three teeth), which compensates for the added weight and the larger wheels. What truly stands out is the engine’s duality. It’s punchy and exciting at high revs when you want it and results in this being the only bike in the segment that manages a sub-6 second 0-100kph time in our tests. But more importantly, it’s also calm and relaxed at lower speeds, which makes it easy to live with on a day-to-day basis. Curved radiator on the 390 Adventure. There are three riding modes – Rain, Street, and Off-Road – which adjust throttle response, ABS and traction control settings. Off-road mode is the most reactive of the three, but it's also usable enough even in the city. One common concern with single-cylinder engines is vibration and the KTM suffers from it as well. While the buzz is very well controlled in the handlebars, it gets quite pronounced in the footpegs, especially at city speeds. However, out on the highway, the vibrations don’t get overwhelming and this bike can hold 120kph or even higher with an ease and composure that its rivals don’t quite match.  The bi-directional shifter is not flawless and sometimes feels a bit clunky, but it adds to the fun factor of this motorcycle. The underbelly exhaust provides a typical KTM soundtrack: a brappy, exciting sound at high revs and a clattery, unremarkable note at gentle speeds – something to be expected from a high-strung single-cylinder engine. As for the exhaust design, an upswept unit would have certainly looked more appropriate but KTM says there are no concerns with water wading and have tested the bike in water crossings 400mm deep. KTM 390 Adventure ergonomics, seat comfort The 830mm seat height is still on the tall end for the average 5’6” rider, but the lower weight and weight balance on this bike make it easier than its immediate rival to manage. The rider ergonomics are also an improvement over the old bike with better placed footpegs. The position is especially improved when it comes to standing up off-road, with more real estate on the bike to grip with your lower body. A slightly taller bar would have been nice for off-road work, but the overall set up works as is. The opposite holds true for the tall, non-adjustable windscreen – it works well at highway speeds but blocks so much air that the rider will wish for more cooling breeze when riding inside the city in the summer heat. The 390 Adventure has ergos that are more conducive to off-road riding now. When it comes to handling, the 390 Adventure feels light and nimble, especially when compared to the Himalayan which weighs a full 14 kilos more. This is a tall bike, but it feels relatively agile and easier to manage in city conditions. A reasonably light clutch and well-controlled engine heat dissipation add to its usability in the city. The seat itself, while not immediately uncomfortable, is on the firm side, and I found myself feeling sore in about an hour’s time. A more plush accessory seat would be nice, but as of now KTM has only three accessories on offer – a more comprehensive front mudguard, a centre stand and a headlamp guard. KTM 390 Adventure off-road performance  The new 390 Adventure shines brightest when it ventures off the beaten path. With a combination of relatively low weight, a balanced feel, and impressive suspension travel, this bike is more than capable in a variety of off-road conditions. The 21-inch front wheel, combined with the confidence-inspiring chassis, allows the 390 to tackle rocky, loose terrains with ease. The ground clearance also encourages you to clamber over large rocks and mounds with the knowledge that the bike also has an aluminium bash plate. All this leads to a bike that encourages you to ride out into unknown terrain, and that’s a very nice thing for an adventure motorcycle. The new 390 ADV is very capable off-road. Things start to become an issue when you push the bike hard, especially over big jumps. At this point, the suspension blows through its stroke and bottoms out. Thankfully, the fork is adjustable for compression and rebound while the rear gets preload and rebound adjustability. I kept adding compression damping till all 30 clicks were in on the fork, at which point the KTM was a lot more compliant off-road, but more skilled riders who intend to push this bike hard off-road will probably want to look at aftermarket options for changing the suspension’s spring weights and/or the damping rates. But despite coming close to the limits of the stock suspension, it's clear that this chassis manages to offer a light and friendly feel, but it is also up for quite a high level of off-road riding. I believe it manages this balance better than any similar rival on sale in India at the moment. KTM 390 Adventure on-road handling On-road handling-wise, the same attributes that appealed off-road makes the difference. The light and agile nature extends to the way the motorcycle corners, and it's a similar story of ease meeting confidence. Direction changes don’t take much effort and the bike is happy to lean quite far over without the footpegs scraping. On the road, the bike feels light and agile, with quick direction changes. Suspension comfort and its ability to absorb rough roads is quite good, but not as good as the Himalayan 450. The Apollo Tramplr tyres are a good fit for the motorcycle in terms of their road grip and ability to handle some off-road riding, but they get quite loud as the speeds rise. As for braking, the move to an axial front brake caliper may seem like a downgrade, but the performance suits the bike well. Initial bite is dull, which is nice off-road, but the braking force ramps up well when you give the lever a harder squeeze. The braking performance on- and off-road is also bolstered by the intuitive ABS system, but for that we must move to the next topic – features. 2025 390 ADV uses an axial caliper but braking performance is still very good. KTM 390 Adventure features, design  The 390 is a very well-specced motorcycle. Its 5-inch TFT looks familiar but has excellent graphics and is controlled via the chunky switchgear on the left. The rear ABS and traction control can both be turned off very easily and the bike remembers your settings and keeps them that way, even after turning it off. Then there’s the aforementioned quick shifter as well as the segment-first cruise control that works quite well. TFT dash is well-laid out, intuitive and feature-rich. This is also the first Indian KTM to offer spoked wheels that support tubeless tyres. These wheels have a patented design that uses a rubber seal to make things air-tight. I imagine there must be some life span to this rubber component, and we’ve asked Bajaj to let us know about this. New design language inspired by KTM's Dakar Rally bikes. The new design theme inspired by the Dakar rally bikes is another improvement in my opinion, and while I still wouldn't call it a classically beautiful bike, it has a new found sense of purpose that I quite like. KTM has also switched to a new material for the bodywork that they say is similar to what's used on the international dirt bikes and is capable of taking much more abuse. The plastic is also pigmented, rather than stickered (including the graphics) which means that if it does get scratched, it will reveal the same colour underneath. KTM 390 Adventure price and verdict The new 390 Adventure offers a great balance of performance, capability, equipment and ease of use. That being said, it also commands a rather steep Rs 3.67 lakh, ex-showroom, and for those who find this to be too much of a leap over the Himalayan 450, the lower-spec 390 Adventure X may be more appealing. Either way, this bike is a huge leap forward for the 390 Adventure nameplate, and in many ways it's what we’d hoped that the original bike would be.  Also See: 2025 KTM 390 Adventure video review",

    "description": "Twenty-five years ago, the first-generation Octavia introduced the Czech brand Skoda to India, and since then, every generation of the car has been on sale here. However, Skoda India pulled the plug on what was the fourth-generation model in early 2023; the good news is it’s coming back this year. What better way to celebrate Skoda India’s 25th anniversary than with the relaunch of the car that started it all? The facelifted fourth-gen model will arrive in the sporty RS guise but will do so as completely built units (read pricey), costing around Rs 50 lakh. So, will it be worth it? To get an idea, we drove the Octavia in Croatia at a racetrack and on the road. Skoda Octavia RS engine and performance Upgraded 2.0-litre TSI engine makes 265hp and 370Nm E888 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine now makes 20hp more at 265hp. While the regular Octavia has a bevy of engine options –petrols, diesels, CNG and hybrids – the RS makes do with the familiar E888 2.0-litre TSI petrol engine, which, for the fourth generation, has new piston skirts and tweaks to the crankshaft and crankcase. And in the RS, its power is up by 20hp to 265hp, while the peak torque is 370Nm. 0-100kph in a claimed 6.4s Given its sporty pretensions, Skoda had an Octavia for us at the Automotodrom Grobnik in Rijeka. It’s a small circuit but perfect for a car like this; an F1 track would make the car feel awfully slow. A few convoy laps were all we had, but straight off, the quick acceleration was apparent and impressive. Skoda claims a 0 to 100kph time of 6.4 seconds, which is plenty fast for a family sedan. Put your foot down, and power comes in eagerly, and you pull away smartly. The gearbox is quick, with the 7-speed DSG unit also capable of being influenced by steering-mounted paddles, which felt small; given the RS guise, I would have preferred larger ones. Keeping up with the lead car driven by an ex-Skoda rally champ wasn’t a problem – but only because he wasn’t pushing it at all. Still, we managed to cross the 200kph mark on the straight and rather easily, too, not surprising given that it had plenty more to give with its 250kph electronically limited top speed. Cruising and overtaking on public roads is effortless Linear power delivery makes highway cruising and overtaking a breeze. Out on public roads, the engine does a great job at daily driver duty, and high-speed expressway cruising was effortless, as was overtaking slower-moving traffic. What’s nice is that power delivery is linear, and for everyday overtaking, you don’t have to wait on the box to drop a gear or two unless you’re in a big hurry and prod further with the throttle. Skoda Octavia RS ride and handling Ride quality is good; Normal and Sport modes work best Octavias have always handled well; they are typically European with a solid, planted ride, and the new fourth-generation RS is the same. On the racetrack, despite a few crests and uneven sections, it tracked well, and only while braking really hard over a crest did I feel the car was a little unsettled. Even high-speed motorway cruising was a steady and calm affair. The expansion joints and undulations, which seemed to be the nature of the roads around us, didn’t upset the car. Ride quality, too, felt good, and I found that the Normal and Sport modes worked the best. The Comfort mode brought in some float over the smooth but undulating roads; it would be best for slow, rough sections of tarmac. Only on bad roads would one have to use the Comfort ride setting.   Body rolls during cornering As for handling, there’s enough grip in corners, but push really hard, and typical of its front-drive setup, it will understeer. The steering has a good amount of weight to it, but it’s not very communicative, especially when viewed through the car’s sporty lens. However, my only issue with the car was the lean around corners. On the track, even in Sport mode, I expected this because of the higher speeds and tighter-than-usual turns, but going up a mountain section, too, this felt more than it should have. Given that the RS has dynamic dampers, I would have liked a tighter body control in Sport mode. Skoda Octavia RS exterior design and platform RS-specific changes make Octavia look sportier The current-generation Octavia was launched in 2019 and is underpinned by the Volkswagen Group’s MQB Evo platform. The car returning to India is that model’s facelift unveiled early last year. The facelift gets the requisite styling updates, but the changes go deeper with a refreshed interior, some new tech and a bump-up in engine power in the RS version. Neat boot lip spoiler finished in black accentuates sporty appeal. On the outside, the car gets a sharper stylistic treatment, even more so in the RS version. The headlights cut prominently into the bumper, and that effect is accentuated by the jagged DRL signature. The bumper has chiselled edges on the outside and pointy, triangular, blacked-out sections that house inlets that channel air around the front wheels. Being the RS version, the grille and lower air intake area are blacked out, with the grille carrying the RS badge. 19-inch alloys don't look too sporty 19-inch aero-optimised alloys don't suit the sporty pretensions. The 19-inch alloys are aero-optimised, and while the company says they reduce drag, they take away some of the sporty look with the large closed-off area. In profile, the Octavia wears the sedan look well, though the boot lid is actually a lift-back design – a hallmark of all Octavias. At the rear, there’s a neat little boot-lip spoiler, and, like the headlights, the tail-lamps have a sharp lighting signature. The bumper’s lower edge has a sporty, blacked-out treatment, with twin exhaust pipes at each side. Skoda Octavia RS interior, features and comfort  13-inch touchscreen is new While the insides of the facelifted Octavia are largely the same, the big change is a new 13-inch touchscreen that’s crisp and responsive to touch. Some controls, such as the engine start-stop, are contained in the screen; thankfully, some functions, like drive-mode selection and HVAC, are via the buttons below. The RS has sports seats that look really cool with their black upholstery and contrasting red elements in the fabric and stitching. All-black cabin with contrasting red stictching looks sporty, and has ample space. Skoda's Simply Clever features are noteworthy The comfort is good, and for my smaller frame, the deep bolstering felt just right. The dashboard is also an all-black affair, covered in neoprene and with red stitching. The three-spoke steering wheel has the RS logo at the bottom and familiar scroll wheels that feel nice to use. Given that this is a Skoda, there are quite a few of the brand’s signature ‘Simply Clever’ features, such as a phone holder that fits inside the cup holders, and my favourite: a small microfibre duster to wipe the touchscreen, stored securely inside the centre console. Octy's cabin is spacious with ample headroom As expected, the cabin is spacious; at both front and rear, there’s considerable headroom, but note that our car didn’t have a sunroof. The legroom, too, is very good, and I had more than sufficient space for my 5-foot 8-inch frame. So, even if you choose to be chauffeur-driven, you’ll be happy here. Front sport seats offer excellent support.   Skoda Octavia RS price, launch and verdict Octavia RS price expected to be around Rs 50 lakh (ex-showroom) As with its predecessors, the new Skoda Octavia RS will be priced higher than its regular sibling, which Skoda is working hard at getting to India after the RS launch. But as these will come as CBUs, expect higher sticker prices – we hear that’s around Rs 50 lakh for the RS. Interestingly, Skoda tells us that instead of importing a fixed number of cars, it will go by customer orders. While that translates into a waiting period of four to five months, it also means that customers can specify a variant and features based on what’s available in the UK. CBU status will mean a price tag around Rs 50 lakh (ex-showroom) for the Octy RS. Customers who sign up can thus expect some level of a personalised RS and, of course, a well-rounded sedan. A more lively handling character would be nice, but that aside, the new Skoda Octavia RS is one gem of a car. It can pull off daily driver duties and transform into a sporty, energetic car with ease. It’s comfy, with plenty of space inside, and the brand has plenty of street cred, too. So it really can be all the car you’ll ever want.

    "description": "The Maruti Alto K10 now comes with 6 airbags, which is standard across the range. With this update, the prices of the Alto K10 have increased by up to Rs 16,000, depending on the variant. Maruti has also changed the names of the Alto K10’s variants, removing the (O) suffix across the range. However, there are no mechanical updates – the 67hp, 1.0-litre petrol engine that’s E20-fuel-compatible, with its manual and AMT options, continues, as does the factory-fitted CNG version.  Maruti Alto K10 prices have increased by Rs 6,000-16,000 Standard safety kit includes 6 airbags, ESP, ABS, EBD Maruti claims 46 lakh Altos have been sold in India Maruti Alto K10 price, ex-showroom, India (in Rs, lakh)VariantNew priceOld priceDifferenceStandard4.234.090.14LXI5.004.940.06VXI5.315.150.16VXI+5.605.500.10VXI AMT5.815.650.16LXI CNG5.905.840.06VXI+ AMT6.106.000.10VXI CNG6.216.050.16 Maruti Alto K10 prices in 2025 Alto K10 VXI variants see the highest price hike Just like it did with the Celerio and Brezza after updating them with 6 airbags, Maruti has raised the prices of the Alto K10, though not to the same degree.

    "description": "The Nissan Magnite will get a new CNG version by April this year, which will come as a dealer-level accessory kit, said a source. This comes shortly after its sister car, the Renault Kiger, received a dealer-level CNG kit, along with the Kwid and Triber. Magnite CNG to be offered with 1.0 NA petrol-MT The CNG kit will be a dealer-level accessory fitment Expect a premium similar to the Kiger CNG Nissan Magnite CNG: what to expect? CNG kit to have a 1-year dealer warranty Our sources have stated that only the 1.0-litre naturally aspirated petrol engine with the manual gearbox will be offered with the CNG kit, echoing the Renault Kiger CNG. The CNG version of the Magnite is expected to return 18-22km per kg. However, detailed specifications, including power and torque outputs with the CNG kit, are not yet available. The Magnite CNG will have the same warranty that Nissan provides as standard for the regular SUV – 3 years or 1,00,000 km, whichever comes first. Additionally, the dealer will provide a 1-year warranty for the CNG kit. The dealers will also ensure RC is updated to reflect the conversion. The CNG kit for the Renault Kiger costs an additional Rs 79,500 over the trim it’s based on, and a similar premium is expected for the Magnite CNG. The CNG kits will be supplied to dealers by the Uno Minda Group. It remains to be seen if the CNG kit will be offered across the line-up or only on select trims. We've reached out to Nissan for an official comment, but the company hasn't responded yet. Growing CNG popularity in India Maruti leads with a 71.60 percent market share As per retail sales data sourced from the Vahan portal, a total of 7,15,213 CNG-powered passenger vehicles were sold in India in the last calendar year by the four carmakers in this segment, marking a strong 35 percent year-on-year increase. Maruti Suzuki, with a 15-model strong CNG portfolio, has a vice-like grip over the segment with a 71.60 percent market share. Tata Motors and Hyundai follow with 16.13 percent and 10.04 percent, respectively, while Toyota has a market share of 2.21 percent. Given its growing popularity, Honda and Renault have recently joined the bandwagon with dealer-level CNG kits, and Nissan will soon follow suit. The CNG kit on the Magnite could further attract additional buyers to the compact SUV.

Strip a 911 down to its studs, load it up with more power than anyone will ever use, tweak the suspension until it stops feeling a bit bitey, and then call it an improvement. It isn’t. It is just progress for the sake of it, and progress does not always move things forward. Lab Eleven is not interested in better for the sake of automotive performance theater. They are interested in better for the sake of driving. Pino La Rosa and his daughter Milena run their shop in Milan the way you would expect from people who actually care about these cars. Every Lab Eleven build starts with an accident free 993 and gets stripped down. What happens next depends on the car and the owner, but the process is always the same. Make it sharper, stronger, and more usable without killing what makes it a 911. \"We are not here to make a completely different car, we are here to make the best possible version of the car that already exists.\" That means no unnecessary gimmicks. No touchscreens, no pointless tech, no desperate attempts to make an air cooled car feel like something that rolled off a production line yesterday.  \"You should still feel the road, still hear the engine, still know what the car is doing beneath you.\"  The engines are rebuilt in three stages. A 3.6, a 3.8, or a 4.0 liter pushing anywhere from 300 to 400 horsepower. It is more than stock but not excessive, just enough to make the car feel alive. This may turn things into a bit of a handful for the rear engined uninitiated, but never more than one. Some panels are swapped for aluminum or carbon fiber, but only when it improves balance and durability. There are no qualifying laps that reward weight savings, and Colin Chapman is not breathing down your neck as you roll out of your garage. The goal is not to shave grams off a control arm or hub. It is about balance. Inside, they stick to materials that belong, wool fabrics, houndstooth, and leather that looks and feels right. Somewhere along the way, the restomod scene evolved into a competition to build the most expensive cars and coffee accessory. Machines that flick their blinkers a few times before arriving at an asphalt prison, only to be tucked back into a temperature controlled garage, polished with an overpriced orbital, and plugged into a twelve volt battery tender, the automotive equivalent of life support. Lab Eleven builds cars that need to be driven. Lab Eleven cars belong on alpine passes, winding back roads, and long stretches of open road where dirt and rock chips are part of the experience. A Porsche was never meant to be perfect. It was meant to be driven, to wear in, to collect the marks of use that prove it is alive, and when the time comes, you pass it on, imperfections and all.

    "link": "",
    "description": "Another car bought sight unseen, another “gotta own this one someday” box checked. It also ticked the “probably definitely won’t break down” box, a critical facet for this purchase. The job? Scout the ’22 Overcrest Rally: 10 days, 8-10 hours a day, and thousands of miles, all in one state. Idaho. The 1979 300TD was rough but rust-free, and as my grandfather would say with a touch of irony, “a smooth runner with a straight body.” Despite its quirks, the W123’s legendary reliability and patience testing pace made it the perfect scout vehicle for the rally.   Most of the state is seen from a 72 mile jaunt across i90. A stretch easily defeated by those that would often rather be “there” than wherever “here” was. In about one episode of a podcast it's over and everyone is on to Spokane, Seattle, Portland, or some far off distant easterly place where pizza and bagels are made just right. No one hops off to venture inland to try some finger steaks or french fries from potatoes pulled out of the ground a few hours earlier. There are no grandma's huckleberry pies on the interstate either. But Idaho's uniqueness goes beyond just the food, it has roads. Some of the best one's you'll ever get the pleasure to find. Idaho proudly wears the Sawtooth Mountains at its heart. At the state’s beltline lies Boise, the capital city that initially wasn’t even on our radar. It lay too far below the squiggly tarmac and unknown mud and gravel of the forest roads. Before heading up there, the car needed a few things. It was the crest of summer, and the air conditioning didn’t work. We needed to install the European headlights that came with the car or we couldn’t bear our own existence. It didn’t have a roof rack, which seemed like a shame, and Jasin, the co-driver, a quiet, sharp, and witty man, wanted a bicycle in case we got stranded somewhere. “Dude, We are not going to need a bicycle. This thing is the most reliable vehicle ever made” “We might.” “We won’t…” Despite the w123 being the most reliable vehicle ever made, we ended up looking for a bike. After a bunch of “is it availables” we still ended up just going to a Pocatello pawn shop. We now had a bike (and cooler for Dews) on our roof rack. The air-conditioning swallowed up some cans of r134, and with some hotwiring of the compressor, we had ac. There was no power with it on, but we had it. 77hp with it off, and probably 65 with it at full chat. The vacuum system controlling the HVAC in the car was shot and screwdrivers were shoved through the vents to hold the blower flap open. It was the only way to get air flow. The fact that each one was essentially a guaranteed death by being impaled in an accident wasn’t lost on us, but aircon is aircon, the bastion and oil gilded holy grail of any old shitbox. If you’ve got it, you’re a king, and we had it. Us kings, royal purveyors and surveyors of the almighty road trip. May all without it bow before our superiority, piety, and condescension.  Far up into the mountains, we were met with snow. It was somewhere between \"no problem\" and \"big problem\" in depth, located a two-hour drive from where we’d started, and just 100 yards from the summit. The other side of the summit, and our route out, was right there. You could have hurled a stone and hit dirt on the other side. It was the answer to all of the “do we really want to drive 2 hours backwards?” considerations. The easy answer to this was no. No we did not. This route was supposed to be on the rally, which meant we’d have to drive back the other side just to check it out. The 30-40 yards of snow that swept across the mud was dense, and slushy, the last vestige of a long winter at 9000 feet. Making it through would save half a day of driving. The bike loomed. “What do you think?” “Not great.” “Not great… yeah.” “Should we make a run at it?” “Sure, why not.” Why not was that it was a really bad idea. At that altitude that car, even with the AC off was gutless. Maybe 50 hp. When it was new. 270k miles ago. The gearshift dropped into low and the old OM617 wheezed without spinning the tires in the mud towards the snow. There was no climax, no “ope, he might make it.” It was beached with just a few yards to go. The bike loomed again. Hours passed and after the digging with the top tray of a toolbox got tiresome the conversation got closer and closer to riding back down the mountain. In the middle of the debate a truck rounded the bend. After a chat the driver realized he wouldn't make it through either, but he did have a tow strap. Kings saved by mere mortals, a story for all time.  “Told you we wouldn’t need the bike.” On the way out, some sort of celestial car karma kicked in and the right front caliper seized. The roads were slick with rain and the car was not doing well downhill.  A call out to social media didn’t help and we were forced into heading to Boise to hit up a junkyard. There, the two wrench trick and some elbow grease yanked a caliper off an old w114 250C. It was pure luck the car was there and we knew it. This was the land of Bumpside Ford’s, not the land of vintage German tanks.  On the way out the door of the yard we spotted another w123 parked right next to ours. A turbo diesel sedan with a lot of miles. This thing had been around the block, a million times. It was well worn. The US headlights were in rough shape with one side missing the bezel, and the other side about to be.  The caliper got chucked in the backseat for later We knew exactly what we had to do. Working fast, we yanked the Euro-spec H4s out of their boxes, uninstalled the very nice US-spec lights, and swapped them out. Just as we finished, the owner of the million-block W123 walked up. As is often the case the man looked a bit like his car. He’d seen a few things and his weathered skin and thin wild hair spoke of it.   “Love your car sir.” “Thanks a lot.” “Hey so we noticed you maybe needed some headlights.” “Yep, thats why I was here, but no luck.” “I tell you what, take these.” “What do you want for them?” “Nothing.” The man thanked us, took the headlights graciously, hopped in his car, and clattered away. It's possible we got stuck and that caliper got seized for a reason.  Incredible roads were in abundance. Warm Lake Road, a monument to loneliness, curling up and up eternally, forcing us to shove snow in the engine compartment to keep going. White bird grade. A high bedrock set of switchbacks set in the hills below Grangeville. Both were empty. No one ever came, and it was ours for every mile. These roads are not in your backyard, and it takes significant effort to get out that far past the border of what people consider nowhere, but it's worth it, when you find out they’re all yours.    Continue...",
