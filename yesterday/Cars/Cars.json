    "description": "This 1958 Mercedes-Benz 300SL is one of 1,858 roadsters built during a six-year production run and was delivered new on October 16, 1958, in Reykjavik, Iceland, as one of 324 examples manufactured for the model year. Chassis 8500280 is said to have been refurbished in Germany in the early 1990s before being relocated to France, and later Italy, where it was purchased by the current owner in 2011. Further refurbishment work was carried out in the early 2010s and involved bodywork, a repaint in white, a refresh of the interior in red leather, and the installation of a black convertible top. Power comes from a fuel-injected 3.0L inline-six paired with a four-speed manual gearbox, and features include dry-sump lubrication, body-color 15\" steel wheels, hydraulic drum brakes, and four-wheel independent suspension with a low-pivot rear axle. This W198 was brought to Monaco in 2023 and is now offered there on dealer consignment with a copy of its factory delivery note, partial service records, and Monégasque registration.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/new-aston-martin-vantage-vs-ferrari-roma-and-911-turbo",
    "description": "Porsche is comparatively subtle, unlike its front-engined V8 companions The Vantage is back with a bang – does it now dominate a class of grand touring superstars? The Ferrari nearly fails to materialise. With the official press car out of action, locating a good, representative Roma is proving to be a proper head-scratcher, something we can’t understand. Since 2020 the model has been the ‘affordable’ departure point into Ferrari-land and sells steadily in the UK. It’s not like we’re sniffing about for a 166 MM. But then, with days to go, a solid lead surfaces, followed by a friendly phone call, and an arrangement is made to borrow the rather beautiful junior Ferrari GT before you: Abu Dhabi Blue, low miles, factory-correct Michelins. The group test of the year can now commence. The Roma simply had to be here. For those in the business of building super-coupés with not only prodigious long-range chops but also the potential for both B-road mirth and 200mph, should the opportunity ever present itself on an empty autobahn, it is the product to beat. It’s arguably the most complete Ferrari of modern times, even if it has never been as celebrated as its V12-engined older sibling, the 812 Superfast. However, the Roma may finally now have met its match. It comes in the form of the latest Aston Martin Vantage, a car whose recent stylistic nip and tuck belies an upwards recalibration of its positioning. Today our would-be Ferrari slayer is a 656bhp silver sledgehammer with gold wheels and green innards, yet somehow VN59 AML is making it all hang together aesthetically, as perhaps only an Aston Martin can. In fact, regardless of the finishing order, the Brit has already won the game of spiking your pulse from 10 yards out. The power-crazed new Vantage does indeed look superb: rippling muscle, tight proportions and fabulous details, even if the blinding chrome exhaust outlets are tacked on. When we stop for a lunchtime sarnie, the people of Kimbolton will gravitate to it, only afterwards noticing the blade form of the Italian car. They will ignore the Porsche Turbo, but that has always been the appeal of a machine that thrums softly while carrying a Californian redwood on its back. The 911 is, in point-to-point pace, a demon. It is also the most practical car of the trio and the most economical, and when it comes to prosaic but meaningful elements such as infotainment and visibility, neither glamorous rival can lay a glove on it. As a 911, the handling will have polish to match the Aston’s fake exhaust tips. It may not get the Kimboltonians swooning, but in this sort of contest, against more aristocratic opposition, Porsche’s 911 Turbo is often a cold-blooded killer. There’s nothing cold-blooded about the Vantage, and it certainly does not in any sense thrum softly. Approach it, peel the door away on its upward-angled trajectory from the devastating contours of the midriff panelling, which sits fully half a foot inwards of the cartoon rear haunches, and enter. Boy, what a difference a heavy update makes. With no changes to the old car’s body-in-white, the pillbox view forward remains to be savoured, but the fussy switchgear, the awkward centre console and the ancient Mercedes-sourced electronics haven’t survived. There’s now an elegance the spacious Porsche can’t capture, no matter how much houndstooth and ‘cognac’ leather the £5k Heritage Design Pack levels at its granite-solid interior. The Aston’s environment will also, as today unfolds, make the economically packaged Roma feel fussy and baroque. In Gaydon they still haven’t quite nailed ‘fit’, but the atmosphere is ebullient GT sophistication. It begs for day-long drives. Foot on brake and hit the Babybel-sized start button, about which spins a rotary for drive modes. Then nada. It’s a quirk of Astons that the electronics often need a moment to process the life-giving command – and it’s usually just as you’re reaching for a follow-up prod that the starter motor drumrolls from inside that clenched fist of a snout, then boom. It’s quite the introduction to the most powerful V8 yet fitted to a street-legal Aston and the AMG DNA is right there in the gargling bassiness of the idle. So, the somewhat new Vantage: stiffer, wider and, holy moly, more powerful than before. It also looks the business and, in a Germanic way, sounds it. But the standout news from a dynamics perspective is not the uplift from 503bhp to 656bhp or the clever Bilstein dampers. It’s the contact patch: Three. Two. Five. Take a moment to process the width of the Aston’s Countach-like rear Michelin Pilot Sports. Is this a hint that the prevailing philosophy for the Vantage is now one of containment not release? For context, the 911 wears 315-sections, the Ferrari dances on filigree 285s. The Roma also has less metal between its axles than the Aston, yet with 611bhp from 3.9 litres of blown V8 (a revvy flat-plane; the Aston’s is a cross-plane for maximum torque-wallop), barely any less oomph. On paper it’s feistier. One thing you soon warm to as those early miles flow under the Vantage’s forged 21in wheels and your relationship with it evolves is how polite this monster can be. Some colleagues consider the ride a tad brittle at low speeds, but to me this is just the Aston’s sense of intent, forgivable because it never spills into discomfort. The suspension takes up speed bumps cleanly and the car rarely if ever crashes through potholes. You may not love the resolute body movements and hefty steering that are a tangible legacy of ex-CEO Tobias Moers, but this shouldn’t be confused with incivility. That said, on its smaller wheels the Ferrari is more silken when trundling (another dynamic bellwether?). It is in general less keen to assert immediately how serious it can be. It’s the garden party guest making affable chit-chat, draped over a wicker armchair, Sobranie in hand, while the Aston, preferring more physical interactions, is busy instigating a game of British bulldog. Mind you, on start-up the Roma is even shoutier than the Vantage, its brusque idle tauter, fizzier. Meanwhile, the Turbo looks on, bemused. As it happens, the Aston’s gait pacifies with speed. With load the dampers find an easy rhythm on most roads, leaving you to relax into a driving position that is second only to the Porsche’s but within a cabin that is considerably more snug and romantic. I’ll say now that the footwell in the Roma is short and the footrest absurdly close. If cruising you’re forced to adopt the recumbent pose of David Gandy – one leg straight, the other bent. It is not the dream for taller drivers. Which car is the better distance companion? The Ferrari’s firm, slim seats are well cupped and seem to plumb you directly into the monocoque, but the Aston’s are more relaxing. The Vantage underlines its slim victory in the matter of grand touring with superior material lavishness. Its leather is as soft as can be and its rifled rotary controls are a joy to swivel. Underneath it all a seething reservoir of 590lb ft makes swift progress seem almost involuntary. The Turbo lacks true long-distance charm on account of its firm back axle, needed to cradle 3.7 litres of flat six and, in the case of our £181k Turbo S, the almighty 641bhp it is ever-prepared to release. On the motorway the breathy roar of the Pirellis drowns out the exhaust and almost all else. You find yourself incrementally ramping up the volume on the excellent Bose system to the point where, were an F-15 Eagle to swoop down and fly directly overhead in tandem, you may not hear it. If an F-15 could catch you, that is. The Turbo is nevertheless a fine place to start when it comes to the ‘proper’ driving part of this test. It is the constant, the control, the palate cleanser. One run along the B660 is all it takes to remind you why Porsche, now an SUV maker, is still celebrated as perhaps the world’s finest purveyor of serious performance cars. You can’t help but marvel at how a colossally blown flat six can be so responsive, seemingly unsullied by turbo-typical woolliness. There are no wrinkles in the calibration of the controls: throttle, brake and steering responses are robust but exact. And so linear. They complement one another seamlessly and in a manner that is all the more astonishing when you consider the Turbo S has the added complexity of front driveshafts and rear-axle steering. The Ferrari and Aston Martin have neither, yet their drivers need longer to gel with either car. They also lack the Turbo’s seat-of-pants feel, which is akin to a reassuring embrace in the Wild West of 600bhp-plus GTs. So you begin to get stuck into the 911 with some relish. The process starts by rotating the drive mode selector, nestled against the airbag cover, from Normal to Sport Plus. This brings the powertrain to the boil, but you must then dial the dampers back into their relaxed state via the dash-mounted toggle: anything else is too firm on British country roads. In any case, so genetically nailed down is this frog-eyed assassin that you need to allow every last ounce of verve to escape in the form of body movements. Such is the Porsche’s immense transparency and your faith in its predictability that you also have no qualms peeling back the ESP – not entirely off, but halfway. And now the 911 Turbo S is ready to blow your mind. And it does, finding total traction and unrelenting thrust in such improbable places that you spend half the time holding on, waiting for the nose to rise up off the road. It never happens, the car instead remaining contained, precise and freakishly absorptive – and, yes, still a little bemused by your efforts. Herein lies the conceptual blindspot of the 911 Turbo: driven at seven-tenths, it has spellbinding accuracy and purity. It is richly rewarding simply to be at the controls, but it is unremittingly locked down. Then, driven at a mad-eyed nine-tenths, you’re subjected to stupefying forces that should not exist in the context of an urbane super-sports model with CarPlay and Isofix.  In these moments the Turbo starts to exhibit a sublimely mischievous dynamism otherwise kept well hidden. You can see the problem, though: at the crucial eight-tenths point the Turbo is peculiarly inexpressive. There’s no question that the Porsche is the quickest car here, but if the aim of group tests is to learn what one car can reveal about another, its presence amounts to more than a predictable conclusion regarding outright pace. After driving the Turbo you notice that the Vantage’s steering is rather uncommunicative – oddly so, given that Aston Martin has gone to the trouble of removing the steering-column damper for the new car. The Ferrari’s brake pedal is also damnably sensitive, to the extent that you never truly acclimatise to its snatchy proclivities. In an otherwise delicate machine, this has to count as a glaring error. The torque-bomb V8 of the Aston also lacks top-end frivolity and mechanical intricacy compared with the Porsche’s outwardly demure but actually quite expressive motor. Meanwhile, the nasal F154 V8 in the Ferrari gets sweeter as you extend it. Dare you feed it those revs? In the sprint to 62mph the Roma is not in the same race as a 911 Turbo, so why does the process of opening the throttle feel even more heart-stoppingly exciting? There are several factors at play. For a start the Ferrari has one of the longest and most deliciously sprung accelerator pedals in existence – it’s a Maranello calling card that is particularly evident here. Combined with the roiling, intensifying exertions of that waspish engine, the sensation of momentum amassing at an increasing rate is magnificent. After alighting the Roma’s high-sided cockpit from a B-road blast, you will of course also have flicked the manettino dial to Race, for the crisper shifts. Another result of this is that you will have loosened the traction control a touch, and it is the sense of barely contained explosivity that makes the Roma’s delivery so memorable. In the Turbo, and to some extent too the generously tyred Aston, you simply bury the throttle and blast forth. It gets samey. The Ferrari, meanwhile, dares you to have its slim, drilled aluminium pedal kiss the bulkhead as the rear axle squats and the tyres surf past the point of total traction. No two corner exits are the same. Allow heavy-footed greed into the process and the Roma gets frisky. In the Aston, you’ll most likely get away with it; the 911 simply vanishes. As an unexpectedly sun-soaked afternoon rolls on, it becomes apparent that security – not just in the sense of straight-line traction but also in broader handling terms – is the defining quality of this test. The Turbo makes a virtue of security, but the Aston and the Ferrari take more nuanced approaches – approaches foreign to one another. Vantage first. This car operates on something of a two-dimensional plane: the suspension’s job is to keep the dreamboat body level. Simple as. Do that and the vast contact patch is preserved, allowing maximum powertrain-uncorking. Slot the dampers into either of the upper two of three levels of firmness and, barring some heave in extreme circumstances, it’s a job done well, to the extent that the grippy Aston often feels barely slower than the 911. This is, to put it lightly, crazy.  One’s ability to confidently tuck into the car’s reserves of power and torque, smug in the knowledge that the electric limited-slip diff, the tyres and the body control have got your back, paves the way for the Aston’s next trick: outrageous throttle-adjustability. The steering has a steady accuracy about it that means darting into bends comes easily enough, and when it’s time to re-enlist the services of that smouldering, volcanic powertrain, the Vantage will play around in a manner so good-natured it is at times unrecognisable from the old car. The new car thus has two distinct personalities: it is mostly a sure-footed, monolithic GT, but it also has the ability to get neatly out of shape on demand. However, this feels like a bolt-on feature; there isn’t much blending between the two states. The Aston also flirts with feeling a tad overwrought. But overall, for a small car with a giant heart, boy, this thing is cohesive. And so damned quick. There’s no point today when I don’t revel in letting it rip through the lower gears, letting its nose cleave assuredly into bends, then zipping out the other side. Yet certain elements hinder it, and they are elements quickly and indelibly exposed by the five-year-old Fandango. The Roma’s handling is three-dimensional. The car is beautifully damped and loves to duck and weave. It does so with such free-spirited zeal you would swear the 100kg deficit in kerb weight it has to the Aston Martin must be double that. In its deft vertical control there’s a lack of inertia you would expect to find in a little Toyota GR86, not a 611bhp four-seat Ferrari. And yes, the brake pedal is a bastard, but the throttle is a beauty and so is the steering wheel. In contrast with the Aston, the rim has an almost ornate slenderness to it and the action is swift but stops well short of feral-ness. A superbly gratuitous paddle-shift action too. It is the sequence of events set in motion by the steering wheel that takes your breath away as surely as a fully lit Turbo S forces air from your lungs. The Roma skims along B-roads carefree, then HALO-drops into bends with laugh-out-loud poise, exploiting a set-up that permits more dive and roll than the Aston (by now you will have pushed the damper-taming ‘Bumpy Road’ button). I had a suspicion that tip-in on the Aston was dogged by momentary front-axle push, and the Roma gleefully confirms it. The Ferrari doesn’t so much ‘corner’ in set-piece style as seamlessly transition its course with a sequence of fingertip commands. And a juicy slither of yaw, if you like. It’s unadulterated flow. Both cars have transaxle layouts and perfect weight distributions but present contrasting interpretations of their pedigree format. Popping the long bonnets is also revealing: the Aston motor is nicely sat back, while the Roma’s is not only sunk deeper but also tucked half-beneath the dash. Then there are those contact patches. Here, well, it’s different religions. What the Vantage wears at the front are a close match to the Roma’s rears. The Roma is a freer creature; the Vantage, so careful to control its mass and deliver its power, locks it all down. So less is more, right? Apparently. The fastest car here finishes last, even if the 911’s only true shortfall is rolling refinement. In every other sense it nails its brief, which is to be an almost miraculously quick point-to-point street fighter you would happily commute in. I should point out that if this test had instead involved a 296 GTB and a McLaren Artura, the Porsche would as happily have got stuck into the mid-engined cars. Next, the Aston. The most powerful and cartoonishly imposing car here is an honourable second. It is the finest outright grand tourer of the three, and owners will adore not only its ability to put power down but also its theatre, usability and sense of unconquerableness. Which leaves the Ferrari. The slowest, oldest car. But also the lightest, the most exuberant and the one that best understands what can make an old-school GT addictively sweet to drive. In truth it’s a bit of a shock just how good the scalpel-sharp Roma remains. All three of these machines are wildly good, of course. But the svelte Italian? So close to perfection it hurts. 1st. Ferrari Roma  Ferrari knocked it out of the park with the Roma. It’s affable and prodigiously talented, with an almost mid-engined fizz about it. Usable too. The GT car as an art form? 2nd. Aston Martin Vantage Indefatigable motor sits ahead of a newly superb cabin. The finest mile-crusher here and joyfully spirited but trails the Roma as a finessed driver’s car. Oh so easy to love. 3rd. Porsche 911 Turbo S Porsche’s exhibition of speed and control is the quickest car here and ridiculously easy to live with. Brilliant but necessarily aloof at times, and it cruises noisily.",

    "description": "Many would call Fiat's city car a 'Five Hundred' rather than a 'Cinquecento', but that logic doesn't always apply... How will you say 12Cilindri, as in the new Ferrari, if you’re an English speaker? Will you opt for ‘Twelve Cylinders’ or will you give it the full ‘Dodici Cilindri’, perhaps touching your forefingers to your thumbs and chucking in a Dolmio Family accent as you go? I ask because I have a colleague or two who say they will not call the new car the Dodici Cilindri. They think it will make them sound like the sort of person who says Paree instead of plain old Paris (insufferably pretentious, in other words).  I thought that was reasonable until I remembered they say Ferrari Roma and not Ferrari Rome, and that they don’t translate Quattroporte (four door) or Testarossa (red head) to English either. So what gives? I’ve said Dodici Cilindri a few times out loud and I rather fear it does make me sound pretentious, a bit like saying Porsch-er, which I’m afraid I also do. Yet I feel no embarrassment saying Maserati Granturismo, nor did I with Fiats Cinquecento (500) or Seicento (600). Although for some of the 500 models, like the new ones, I do instead say Five Hundred. And it’s possible that the potential problem lies in numbers: the mix in the 12Cilindri’s name of both numerals and letters. If it were numerals only, I’d do the translation: like we do Five Hundred, or Nine Eleven rather than Neun Elf (Porsche). Yet if it were spelled out, as it is with Europa (Lotus) or Torino (Ford), I would say it in its natural form.  There’s almost enough evidence there to make a solid call for the style guide. Almost, but not quite: because the Ferrari 250 Europa is surely a Two Fifty Europa, and what is a 458 Italia if not a Four Five Eight Italia? Alas, I don’t think there’s a definitive precedent. So I’m going to give Dodici Cilindri the full Captain Alberto Bertorelli treatment, and you can think what you like.",

    "description": "Have you noticed how photographers often favor the right-hand side of a motorcycle? Sometimes it’s because the bike’s side stand has it leaning over to the left, making it awkward to capture a good angle. Other times, it’s because the right-hand side is simply more visually appealing than the left. That’s not the case with this 1970s Harley Shovelhead, which features a burly open primary, a bespoke oil tank, a hand-shifter, and a handmade exhaust system—all on the left side. It’s the work of the Japanese custom bike builder Masumi Tsuchino, who operates out of Iruma in the Saitama Prefecture, just northwest of Tokyo. Tsuchino-san qualified as a mechanic out of school, then cut his teeth at a Toyota dealership.…",

    "description": "Hero’s Xpulse 200 4V has been updated, and it’s offered in two variants: Standard and Pro. As the name suggests, the Pro is essentially the erstwhile Rally Edition, and it’s the more extreme version of an already capable off-road motorcycle. It is also available with a set of optional Maxxisknobbies that you see on our test bike. Hero has given the Xpulse 200 4V Pro some new features this year, and I took this motorcycle out in its natural habitat to find out what it’s like. You now also get three switchable ABS modes. Hero has made some noticeable changes to the 2024 Xpulse range, which includes new reinforced knuckle guards, new switchgear, revised footpeg position, a new projector LED headlamp, a USB charging socket and ABS modes. The all-new headlamp is significantly brighter and incorporates an all-new Daytime Running Lamp design, making the Xpulse appear slightly more upmarket. New switchgear feels better to use. Unique to the Xpulse Pro is a new rally-styled windshield that is 60mm taller than before. The rally visor deflects wind well on the road. All in all, the new changes are a welcome addition and will improve the overall usability of this motorcycle. As before, the Pro variant towers over everything else on the road and stands tall while looking purposeful. Its size is deceptive, and many onlookers assume it is a motorcycle with a much larger capacity. An efficient motor that could use some more power. The Xpulse continues to be powered by a 199cc, oil-cooled motor that produces 19hp at 8,500rpm and 17.35Nm at 6,500rpm. What has improved is that with its OBD2 update, the engine now needs to be serviced every 6,000km instead of the 3,000km. Due to its easy power delivery, this motor continues to perform adequately, and is a boon to use for inexperienced off-road riders. At 161kg, the Pro variant is only 2kg heavier than its standard counterpart, which isn’t too bad given all the added hardware. Allows upto 25 clicks of rebound damping adjustment While the knobby tyres provided excellent grip, the engine lacked the power to overcome it. So sliding this motorcycle was not as easy as it is on ADVs that sit in a higher segment. What helps its case is that you will never find yourself running out of grip, and the Xpulse Pro keeps its cool even when climbing up sections with loose surfaces. While I still wish for more power, I have also come to enjoy its underpowered and calm nature on such tricky trails. Maxxistyres cost Rs 16,000 extra. The Xpulse Pro is a challenge to ride on the tarmac if you choose the Maxxistyres – they are road legal, but are also zero-compromise knobbies built for off-road. Grip itself is fine, but the tyres feel scary when the bike is leaned over and they also make a loud, constant droning noise. The tyres also get unsettled over road irregularities and expansion joints can change the bike’s course at any given moment. On the normal Ceats, the bike would be much nicer, but you’ll still need to live with the very tall seat height – we’ll get back to that. Fork compression damping can be easily adjusted. However, when they hit the dirt, these tyres come into their elements and provide an incredible amount of grip. Compression and rebound damping can be dialled in on the adjustable fork, and the owner’s manual has multiple setting recommendations for various riding situations and these settings are a good starting point from where you can tweak the set-up to your liking. My biggest challenge was the 891mm seat height, which can take getting used to and initially be a little daunting. Mind you, this is with the stock seat and going for the optional rally style bench seat will take that number above 920mm. The Xpulse 200 4V Pro compels you to find your nearest trail. The added height makes the motorcycle feel sluggish and more top-heavy, and this is where the humble engine’s limits become more apparent. However, in time, I’ve gradually gotten more comfortable with its size, and wrestling it off-road has become easier as you go. What has helped is the new footpeg positioning along with the handlebar risers that allow riders to get a better grip and find a more suitable position while standing. Tall ride height towers you over everything else on the road. Hero’s Xpulse 200 4V is a competent machine, and the Pro variant makes it even more unstoppable. That being said, it takes a certain skill level to get the most out of this bike. The suspension is best suited for high-speed off-roading. Shorter, or lesser skilled riders might be better off with the standard Xpulse for slower-speed trails. Either way, the updated features do a great job of uplifting the overall experience. The Xpulse 200 4V Pro is in its element out in the mud. It is worth noting that all of the above-mentioned additions have come at a mild price bump of Rs 3,000, which sounds like a sweet deal. All in all, the Xpulse 200 4V Pro is an excellent alternative to the standard variant and costs Rs 8,000 more, which, given its credentials, sounds too good to be true. The Pro variant is an easy recommendation for anyone skilled enough to dive deeper into the off-road genre of motorcycling. Also see: 2024 Yezdi Adventure review: Incremental changes",

    "description": "Viaterra’s Holeshot Pro is a sporty glove that offers a hybrid between race looks, good protection and street-friendly comfort. From a distance, these look a lot like a sporty, track-oriented glove, especially if you go for one of the coloured versions, like the blue ones here. But take a closer look and you’ll see that a significant portion uses a mesh construction for better breathability. The top of the thumb and the first three fingers are all mesh, with some soft rubber protectors. The pinky finger gets a leather panel sewn onto the mesh to protect against abrasion, as this is a common impact area in a crash. The top of the glove around the knuckle area is all leather, and there’s another patch of leather above the wrist as well. The entire palm is leather and there’s a high-grip panel below the fingers. All the leather used is perforated for better breathability. Carbon fibre protector for the ulna is nice at this price point. Protection levels aren’t as high as those of a full-gauntlet race glove, but they’re good nevertheless. You’ll get Knox scaphoid armour for the palms, as well as some armour for the ulna bone on the outside of your wrist. For street gloves, this is more than sufficient, but you won’t find things like a bridged pinky finger or externally stitched seams here, although Viaterra offers those in its top Grid 3 full-gauntlet glove. The Holeshot Pro gloves have touchscreen-sensitive leather patches on the thumb and index finger. The tops of the fingers also get reflective elements to improve nighttime visibility. The wrist closure is secured by a single velcro strap, and they’re easy to get on and off. The overall fit is on the snug side, especially in the knuckle region. The gloves break in over time, but the fit is sporty; if you want something more relaxed, you’ll want to look elsewhere. I like the balance of sportiness and usability the Holsehot Pro packs in for life in the city, and the price is worth what you’re getting.

    "description": "Exactly 25 years ago, in September 1999, Autocar India started its innings with the new Ford Ikon on the cover. A world exclusive, the story showcased Ford’s new sedan for India, powered by the powerful and responsive 1.6-litre Rocam engine. The car was a delight to drive, the engine was super responsive, and this set the tone for the future of Ford in India. The even bigger story, though, was that this was Ford’s first new car after the Mahindra-Ford JV had been dissolved. Fast forward 25 years and Ford India is set to make a comeback after its planned Mahindra alliance was aborted. Talk about history repeating itself. And the Ford that is likely to go on sale first is the 2024 Everest. Previously known as the Endeavour in India, Ford’s new Everest is an SUV that is much missed here. A more sophisticated rival to Toyota’s Fortuner, Ford’s big SUV always rode better, drove better and was more luxurious and comfortable inside.   The plan Now, with the closest place we could get our hands on Ford’s Everest being Nepal, and Ford almost certain to retain the Everest name in India (for the first time), we just had to try and drive the Everest up to where we could see Mt Everest. You can catch a glimpse of the famous mountain from the top of a hill not too far from Kathmandu, called Nagarkot. Getting to Nagarkot, however, involves a long ascent where you climb almost a kilometre, and once up, there’s no guarantee we’ll be able to see Sagarmatha or ‘head of the sky’ as Mt Everest is called in Nepali. The mountain is around 110km away and appears as a small peak between two closer (so ‘taller’ looking) peaks. And that’s not it; with monsoon clouds bouncing off the high Himalayas and collecting at their base at this time of  year, we’ll need a gap in the high clouds to see it.  View from Nagarkot, 2,175m, in pictogram above. (SOURCE: Google Maps)   Familiar but different Nepal initially feels very familiar. There are plenty of Tatas, Mahindras and Marutis present and the drivers in Nepal seem to have graduated from the same driving schools as drivers in India. Bikes slip though every gap, drivers here practice the same ‘cut, thrust and parry’ and not even monks practice defensive driving.  20-inch wheels and ‘tough’ alloys hit the spot. Coming face to face with the new Everest at the Go Ford dealership gives me some succour. It looks even more imposing and larger. And around the side, it gives me the impression of being larger than even the Endeavour we had in India. Marginally longer and built on a 40mm longer wheelbase, the real reason it looks bigger, however, is that this big body-on-frame SUV is now even more block like. The nose is wider and more square and the ‘C’-shaped LEDs that frame the headlight clusters accentuate the width. The flat bonnet is also full of cuts and creases, the chrome bars that flank the Ford logo give the bluff cowl a modern look and what also adds muscle are the mildly flared fenders. In profile, the big 20-inch wheels help give this big SUV a solid, planted look, and I really like the ‘tough’ two-tone design of the alloys. The bi-turbo badge below the fender tells us this diesel has two turbos placed in series. Go back further and the widened rear fenders help give the Everest a nice wide stance from the rear as well. The cabin isn’t too tall, it’s nicely tucked in from the lower body and what really catches my eye are the clear tail-lights that light up bright red. I even like the manner in which the word Everest has been boldly emblazoned across the rear.  It will be called the Everest Everest iconography shifted here from spare. in India as well.   Endeavour, expidition It’s afternoon by the time we leave Kathmandu. The traffic hasn’t gotten any better and slipping this massive supertanker into the stream of traffic proves to be tricky. The arterial roads we initially traverse are narrow and full of parked vehicles, so I really have to inch forward carefully. Visibility from the driver’s seat is good, and the light and very accurate steering makes it easy to place the Everest; important in a vehicle of this bulk. The steering doesn’t quite seem to have the heft of the earlier Endeavour, but the Everest’s steering is quicker at low speeds. That, along with the relative lack of effort to twirl it, sort of makes this bulky SUV feel a bit easier to manage.  As we leave the confines of the city and get onto faster roads, I notice that the ride is very comfortable. It isn’t just the bump absorption, that SUVs like this one normally ace it’s also the refinement, the flat ride and the relative lack of secondary movement associated with a body-on-frame SUV like this. Ride isn’t pillow soft, but the manner in which the Everest absorbs a section of bad road – silently, smoothly and without any hint of heave-ho – makes it both comfortable to sit in and effortless to drive. I just don’t need to slow down unless the holes are particularly large and deep. And the Everest also feels very stable at speed. It even feels more planted the faster you go; Ford’s big boy really does give you plenty of confidence to press on. The climb Once we turn off for Nagarkot, we transition onto some wide ghat roads that sweep around in a nice flow. Leading us ever upwards, the wide sweepers are well paved for the most part. Since there’s practically no traffic, I can really enjoy the drive up. The big takeaway here is that the Everest feels light on its feet and ever ready to change direction.  And it isn’t just the quick steering, it’s a combination of factors. One key contributor has to be Ford’s superb body control and poise. Almost always comfortable in a corner, it feels well balanced and ever willing to alter its line. This is a clear step up on the last-gen Endeavour sold in our market and the confidence it delivers from behind the wheel means you always feel relaxed and enjoy going quicker. Wish the brakes had more bite though. The only time you ‘feel’ the weight of the Everest is when you have to get relatively hard on the brakes. More initial bite and better pedal feel needed here for sure.   Bi-turbo engine gives the Everest an X factor. Half way through our one kilometre or so climb, we run into what feels like a mini cloudburst. Rivulets of water stream down the ghats and we have to clamber over some small rocks that have run down along with the water and silt. The Everest just takes everything in its stride, casually hopping over everything.  As we carry on our way up the mountain, now looking down on the weather below, what I also realise is that the bi-turbo engine contributes significantly to the Everest’s  effortless nature. Incidentally, the engine’s still made in India, and it’s smooth, refined and always on the boil. Refinement, in fact, is so good, it feels like a new generation of engine. And what I especially like is how quickly it responds to a tap on the throttle. With 210hp and 500Nm of torque, it clearly can deliver the goods at higher engine speeds. And here, too, there is no hesitation. There are no flat spots and no surges over practically the entire rev range. And that’s despite the engine being driven by a pair of turbos in sequence; something that’s difficult to do. Not sure how seamlessly this engine will transition from its current EU IV state of tune to our BS VI equivalent, though. 2.0 diesel is made in India; is smooth, seamless and makes 210hp and 500Nm of torque. Even the 10-speed automatic gearbox feels more responsive and intuitive. It still shifts up too early when you lift off the throttle to cruise and only comes a gear down, instead of two, when you tap the throttle. Still, the gearbox works better with this bi-turbo engine as the small turbo spins easily providing sufficient boost at low engine speeds. What irks is that there are no paddles on the steering wheel, only fiddly plus and minus buttons on the gear lever; odd on an otherwise well-specified SUV. What’s cool, however, is how the electrically driven gear selector returns on its own to P if you open the door or even switch the car off in D; remember to try it.   You can shift gears manually using these buttons.   Looking out, looking in We only reach the top of Nagarkot at sundown. Our weather app says there should be a small window the next morning, especially when it comes to medium clouds, and that’s just what we are hoping for. The next morning, though, it all seems pointless – we are enveloped in cloud. So we begin to shoot the exterior; details, highlights and some bits inside the cabin that are well lit. Then, just as we are about to give up hope, a sliver of light opens out, with the gap getting larger every minute. Soon, we can see many peaks close to us and some of the high Himalayas in the distance. We quickly look in the direction of the Everest using our GPS and train our cameras on the dark peak; it’s often the one with the least snow on it because of the high winds. But now, the clouds are back – in batches – drawing a veil of white over the range on and off. Clouds bubbling up from below as the earth heats up. More gaps open later and we see what we think is the Everest. Drive modes and off-road settings are easily accessible from here; no need to fiddle with screen. But the clouds cover it again, and with nothing to do but wait, I decide to take a closer look at the cabin. There’s loads to like here and my attention is initially drawn to how it feels like there’s a bit more space inside. This Everest feels wider and there appears to be more driver space. This version also gets powered and cooled front seats that are big and comfortable even on long drives.  What I am drawn to next is the 12-inch Tesla-like screen with its portrait orientation and sharp details. Apple CarPlay works nicely here and what’s neat is that you can scale up Apple CarPlay at the touch of a button. The screen runs Ford’s Sync 4A software and what’s also Tesla-like here is that you get a digital sketchpad; for when you are waiting and the kids are bored. It’s only software, so why not. You also get a 360-degree camera and, as earlier, a valet mode. Cool graphics work with off-road modes. The Everest also gets a full suite of ADAS functions, with pre-collision assist and automatic emergency braking. The version we are driving has 4X2, 4X4 and 4-low modes, accessible via a dial. In addition, you can select various off-road modes: tow (which is new), slippery, mud and ruts, and sand. Do this and the display even pops up and tells you how the four-wheel-drive system is being optimised with locking diffs, à la Range Rover. The touchscreen has fan and temperature controls, but there is also a set of physical air-con control knobs and buttons. Twin gloveboxes, but plastic quality isn’t great. Narrow door pockets apart, storage and stowage are also decent. The square elbow box is huge, the twin gloveboxes manage a good amount of room between them and there are full-sized cup holders and a tray to keep knick knacks below the central console. The black on black dash, however, looks more utilitarian than upmarket, and plastic quality in and around the central console is only ordinary. Ford will certainly need a more upmarket version of the Everest for the Indian market. And while the digital instrument panel proffers up some great graphics, the ‘digital’ tachometer and small temperature, fuel and oil pressure gauges on the instrument panel need to be more legible. Come on Ford, this is easy. Space in the second row of the Everest is also improved. Legroom and even headroom are more than sufficient, and as the cabin is wider, there seems to be more space in general. The seat is set a bit low, so the seating position is a bit knees-up. You can, however, slide the second-row bench forwards or back and the backrest can be reclined as well. You also get a blower control in the back as well as a regular plug point, so you can charge or power even laptops. Even more space at rear, but seat is low. There’s also a bit more room in the third row, especially after optimising and adjusting the space used for the first and second row. Getting in isn’t easy, but once you are in, short journeys are sort of manageable.  What the Everest also gets, even three rows up, is a fair amount of boot space. You can stack around four pieces of hand baggage in the back or even two big bags. The third row seats can be folded electrically (up and down) for more space. Third row now gets a bit more space but small seats are still only for short drives or children.   Up where it belongs Ford’s new Everest is a full-size SUV that ticks almost every single checkbox. And it is a long list. Big, bold, spacious, comfortable and well-equipped, the new Everest is a large-sized body-on-frame SUV that delivers a solid build, real off-road ability and is practical. It is also refined, sophisticated, easy, effortless and enjoyable to drive. It drives so well, in fact, that it feels like it’s built on a monocoque chassis.  Then there’s the bi-turbo diesel, which is smooth, punchy and responsive. You do miss having paddle shifters, and Ford needs to look at a more upmarket version of the Everest, with a higher quality dash (in particular); paddle shifters would make for a welcome addition, too. But, be in no doubt Ford, when you eventually decide to make a return, this is the SUV to do it with.  FORD’S COMEBACK When will Ford return to India? This is a question that is difficult to answer. What we can tell you, however, is that Ford has held on to its plant in Chennai and is currently working on a plan to make a comeback. And from what we hear, the Everest is part of that plan. Ford is likely to assemble the car here in India, just as it did earlier, and it is also likely to use the Sanand-made diesel engine. There’s even a bi-turbo 3.0 V6 diesel that makes 250hp and 600Nm of torque if Ford wants to get the Everest in as an import, and that sure will get the attention of SUV lovers.

    "description": "It was one of those perfect drives, a rare window of relative emptiness on India’s busiest highway. A mid-morning dash to the BU Bhandari showroom for the launch of the Mercedes-AMG GLC 43 was the easiest Mumbai-Pune trip I’ve done in a long time. Making the drive particularly relaxing was the new addition to Autocar India’s fleet, the all-electric Mercedes EQE SUV, which got its first highway outing. It took just two hours and six minutes in the ultra-smooth (and quick) EQE SUV to go from the Autocar HQ to the BU Bhandari Showroom on the Pune bypass. That’s less than what many office folks take to get home on a typical working day in Mumbai. It does help that the AtalSetu has brought our office closer to the edge of Mumbai, and a 10:15am departure was a sweet spot (or time). The early-morning highway rush was over, the toll plazas had no long queues, and even the Lonavala Ghat, which is choked most of the day (and night) on Google Maps, was surprisingly ‘blue’. Traffic flowed without holdups, even on the steepest sections where trucks otherwise block all lanes while trying to ‘overtake’ at a crawl. Strong and smooth powertrain effortlessly gobbles miles. The Atal Setu is always a great place to try out the ADAS system on any car. The wide and perfectly marked lanes and the gentle curves on this 21km sea bridge were perfect for checking out the EQE SUV’s ‘Level 2’ ADAS capability. That meant letting the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), which I have set at 99kph (just below the 100kph speed limit), and the Lane Keep Assist do the work while I sat back and relaxed with just a light hand on the wheel, enjoying the harbour’s breathtaking views. The Lane Keep Assist worked brilliantly, keeping the big Merc centred nicely in the fast lane. When changing lanes, I was impressed with how the ACC reacted smoothly. When you signal and shift into the overtaking lane, the ACC provides strong and linear acceleration without abrupt power surges to match the new lane’s speed. Active Brake Assist activates at the slightest hint of an obstacle. While the ADAS in the Mercedes EQE SUV is highly advanced, it has some limitations, especially when dealing with erratic drivers who slice across lanes like it’s a normal thing to do. If some idiot abruptly cuts into your lane from a sharp angle, the ADAS can struggle to react promptly. This is not the case with just the EQE SUV – no ADAS is fully capable of handling such unpredictable events, which is a reminder of why the tech can only assist and not replace the driver. Mercedes’ Active Brake Assist, while a great safety feature on paper, can become a nuisance – and even a potential hazard – in Mumbai’s chaotic traffic. Designed for controlled environments, it doesn’t quite account for the unpredictability of pedestrians darting across roads or scooters weaving through tight gaps. The system often triggers unnecessarily, slamming on the brakes at the slightest hint of an obstacle. In such congested conditions, this overly sensitive response can be more dangerous than helpful. These fierce and abrupt stops are hugely unnerving for the passengers and could catch a driver behind you off guard, increasing the risk of rear-end collisions. It’s best to switch the Brake Assist off, which you have to do every time you start the car. The monsoons have made mincemeat of the Nhava Sheva road, which connects the Atal Setu to the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, and on such surfaces, the EQE SUV is out of its comfort zone. To be honest, it doesn’t quite live up to its SUV credentials and isn’t comfortable dropping in and out of potholes like its IC engine brethren. That’s because the softly sprung EQE SUV uses up its suspension travel quite easily, and deep ruts and craters crash through. In fact, it’s best to use ‘Sport’ drive mode as the default setting. The suspension feels overtly soft in Comfort and Normal modes, which is fine when you are crawling in rush hour, but up the pace a bit on even a slightly smooth road, and you’ll find the EQE SUV tends to wallow and feel floaty. In Sport mode, the suspension tightens nicely to give a more settled ride, which is what you want on the highway. Wallows at speed because of soft suspension. Two areas where the EQE SUV stands out are performance and range, and both are interlinked because, with great range, you can enjoy the performance without keeping an eye on the SOC meter. Plant your foot down, and this big and heavy SUV lunges forward with an intensity that can take you aback but in a very pleasing way. The EQE SUV gathers with velvet smoothness, and before you know it, you’ve sailed past the speed limit. On the Mumbai-Pune expressway, which is now infested with speed cameras, it is hard not to get a speeding ticket. To stay out of trouble, I limit my indulgence to short jabs of the accelerator pedal just to enjoy all the 408hp and 858Nm of torque that puts most IC engine SUVs to shame. I averaged 66kph on the 140km drive to BU Bhandari, which is pretty good if you consider that this included slow, non-expressway sections. Not that the expressway raises your average speed dramatically because with so many cameras staring at you, I’m forced to show a lot of restraint! With 332km range left, I didn’t need to use the Pune Mercedes dealers’ on-site 180kW fast charger, but it’s good to know that it’s there and that the dealership is happy to let non-Merc owners plug in as well. Located just off the Pune bypass, it’s an incredibly convenient place for EVs on a long-distance trip to Mahabaleshwar or beyond to quickly top up their batteries. Phenomenal range eliminates range anxiety. The return journey was equally uneventful. Using the regen down the Lonavala Ghat, I could extend the range even further, which, on this round trip, I calculated to be 504km. That is a truly impressive figure, considering how hard I was driving the EQE SUV. In fact, there was enough charge left in the battery (36 percent) for me to make another trip to Pune! The other area where the EQE SUV shines is refinement. The EQE SUV is not just quiet; it’s like being inside a luxury vault on wheels. The adaptive air suspension noiselessly glides over any surface, and then there’s the acoustic insulation, which Mercedes has absolutely nailed. Road, tyre and wind noises, even the electric motor’s faint whir, are gone. The cabin is like a calm oasis, and that’s what makes the EQE SUV special. It is luxury in its most serene form.

    "description": "Following an action-packed festive season with several special edition launches, November is going to be equally exciting, with four new launches and unveils lined up this month, including two new very important Marutis, a new Skoda SUV and a sporty Mercedes sedan. Let’s take a closer look at what to expect from each. Maruti Suzuki eVX November 4 First showcased in concept guise at the 2023 Auto Expo, Maruti Suzuki will globally unveil the production version of the eVX electric SUV on November 4 in Milan, Italy. This underscores the eVX’s importance as a global product for parent company Suzuki, as a significant portion of the production of the made-in-India EVs, has been marked for export to Europe and Japan. Indian audiences will have to wait until the Bharat Mobility Global Expo 2025 to see the production-spec eVX in the flesh. This will be Maruti’s first born-electric vehicle that will also spawn a Toyota derivative. The eVX will get a 60kWh battery which is said to give it a range of up to 500km, and it will also come with an AWD system. The price announcement is slated for March 2025. Skoda Kylaq November 6 Skoda will unveil the Kylaq on November 6 in production form, which will be the company’s first attempt at the sub-compact SUV segment, and it will be based on the MQB-A0-IN platform that also underpins its larger sibling, the Kushaq. However, to slip under the 4-metre length, the Kylaq will have a shorter wheelbase as compared to the Kushaq. Skoda says it will be the first model to bring the new ‘Modern Solid’ design language to India but it isn’t likely to stray too far away from the Kushaq, to maintain a family look; the interior, too, is expected to be largely carried over. The Kylaq will be powered by the familiar 1.0-litre TSI turbo-petrol engine that will come with 6-speed MT and AT gearboxes. The price announcement will be due by early-2025. Maruti Suzuki Dzire November 11   Following Maruti’s first EV will be the launch of one of its core volume generators in India, the all-new Dzire. Although it will be based on the new-generation Swift, recent Dzire spy shots gave us a completely uncamouflaged look at the compact sedan, and at least visually, it looks far removed from its hatchback sibling. The new Dzire boasts a much sharper and mature design and is even likely to include a segment-first electric sunroof. The interior and most of the equipment, however, is expected to be carried over, unchanged. The new Dzire will be offered with the same 1.2-litre, three-cylinder Z Series petrol engine as the Swift, which makes 82hp and 112Nm. It will also get a petrol-CNG option. Mercedes-AMG C63 S E Performance November 12 Mercedes-Benz will launch the new AMG C 63 on November 12. The AMG C 63 drops the V8 for a new plug-in hybrid setup that combines a 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbo-petrol engine along with a rear-mounted electric motor. The engine on its own puts out 475hp, while the electric motor produces 203hp, taking the total output to 680hp. It gets a 9-speed multi-clutch automatic gearbox with all-wheel drive. The C 63 also gets four-wheel steering, and thanks to the 6.1kWh battery pack, can travel on electric power alone for 13km. It also looks sportier than the regular C-Class with the AMG grille and redesigned front bumper with active cooling flaps. The interior, too, will carry AMG-specific touches, like a new steering wheel and new upholstery.

    "description": "We recently reported that Mercedes-Benz had slightly rejigged the variant and equipment configuration on the new-gen E-Class, offering the Superscreen only on the top-spec AMG line trim with E 450 4Matic variant. The company has, however, now clarified that the Superscreen continues to be available as standard on all variants of the E-Class - the E 200, E 220d and E 450 4Matic.  The ‘Superscreen’ setup comprises a 12.3-inch free-standing digital instrument cluster, a 14.4-inch touchscreen infotainment system and a 12.3-inch passenger touchscreen. The official statement from Mercedes-Benz India said,  \"We want to clarify, Mercedes-Benz during the initial production, manufactured a limited 72 units of the LWB E-Class without the Superscreen, some of which were also used for the certification purpose, owing to an initial shortage of Superscreen. These limited units are since sold by our Franchise Partners. Mercedes-Benz however, will continue retailing the LWB E-Class in the current E 200, E 220d variants and the upcoming E 450 variant, with the MBUX Superscreen as a standard configuration.\" The E 200 and E 220d variants come in the Avantgarde spec, while the range-topping E 450 4Matic is available in the AMG Line trim. The two trims were largely differentiated on the cosmetic front with different looking bumpers and wheels. Also See: New Mercedes E-Class review: Has the best gotten better?",

The event in mention is the annual 28 Liberty car show, hosted by Carpark in the financial district of Manhattan. Like many other Carpark events, organizers Rob Blackman, Jeffrey Einhorn, and Liz Gilchrist create a show that is as much a celebration of the cars as it is a gathering of people.
