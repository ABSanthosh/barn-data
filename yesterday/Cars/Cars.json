    "description": "At heart, this is a Lotus Seven – just one with 666bhp per tonne and Le Mans-grade materials tech You descend into the cockpit of the Donkervoort F22 to find Sabelt harnesses but also, if specified, heated seats. At just 750kg wet, it is light enough to belong in the super-lightweight clique, yet the contact patch is almost to Ferrari 430 Scuderia spec. Then there is the power-to-weight ratio, which is a satanic 666bhp per tonne, though engineers on the project insist the car is capable of rewarding those of a more saintly disposition (or simply unable to take it by the carbon scruff).They also say it’s fit for touring, with real ride quality, yet there’s little doubt this car would munch anything the sensible side of a McLaren 750S were you to unsheathe one at a track day, as many owners will do.The Dutch are refreshingly no-bullshit and we know from experience that this attitude translates into the product at Donkervoort, whose Lelystad factory is noteworthy for being built on reclaimed land and sits 3m below sea level.In the 45 years since Joop ‘The Professor’ Donkervoort secured his country’s rights to the Lotus 7 and launched the S7, the company has mastered the cigar-tube-on-wheels format and taken it to ever more riotous levels, but always with method behind the madness in the form of pedigree engineering. In 2020, Matt Prior discovered as much when he drove the D8 GTO, the model that makes way for the wilder F22. It was “blindingly quick” and “thoroughly sorted” but also on another level to anything by Caterham in terms of weekend-away ability. The catch? An eye-widening price.On the way here, quite naturally, I was preoccupied with the driving element. That power-to-weight ratio borders on the macabre and rain was forecast. However, once on the factory floor, the balance shifts. Passing through the double doors that connect Donkervoort’s showroom to the workshop behind, you begin to understand how Augustus Gloop may have felt when he found himself backstage at the Chocolate Factory: transfixed.Machine polishers whirr, blue blasts emanate from the brazing bench where the F22’s thin-gauge tubular frame is made, and colour is everywhere: Audi’s red-headed engines, gold AP Racing calipers ready to install, colour-coded diffuser vanes and coil springs, and the flawless paint jobs of cars in build, with no two alike. One is done up in the colour scheme of Ayrton Senna’s helmet, another in Gulf livery. It sounds like over-egging the pudding somewhat but, honestly, both Donks look sensationally good.It’s enough to make you overlook the most important colour of all: grey. Or rather, the charcoal hue of carbonfibre. And not typical carbonfibre, which is laid up in strips then baked in an autoclave, though they have one of those too. This is the cutting-edge bit of the F22, because Donkervoort has spent 10 years developing what it calls Ex-Core – an ultra-strong composite made by filling shells of carbon with foam that expands when heated inside a mould. The foam solidies, giving the part immense resistance to deformity but incredible lightness.The Ex-Core hub is hidden away at the back of the workshop proper and isn’t only tasked with making F22 bits. It’s a charming quirk of the Donkervoort operation that in one corner of this tiny factory they might be restoring an S8T from 1985, while at the other end the Ex-Core team are constructing aero elements for overnight shipping and fitment to, for example, Toyota’s GR010 LMH.Other clients include at least one Formula 1 team, which remains unnamed, but as the project grows, expect Ex-Core to crop up in all sorts of applications, not just automotive.",

    "description": "Munich’s 50-year-old executive car icon goes boldly into the electric age Before we delve into the various strengths and weaknesses of the BMW i5, let’s rewind.After all, executive saloons have over previous decades gained a reputation for conservatism that, while hard to shake, is now entirely unjustified.Twenty-five years ago, company car buyers wanted efficient diesel engines in packages priced and equipped just so. They didn’t want expensive powertrain technology. They didn’t even want riskier shades of paint.At the time, BMW played to that brief spectacularly well. But now the executive car market has changed out of sight, under the pressure of CO2-based tax regimes.And how the BMW 5 Series has changed along with it. The eighth generation of this mid-sized four-door is taking another bold step into the future. Incorporating updated versions of the mild- and plug-in hybrid powertrains of its predecessor, but casting out their diesel engines entirely, it is the first 5 Series to be offered as an all-electric model.The zero-emissions i5 – the subject of this test – will be available in both saloon and Touring guises, and with a choice of single- or dual-motor powertrains.Two years ago, Autocar had never road tested a fully electric BMW saloon, but now the i5 becomes the third, following the BMW i4 and BMW i7, with the likes of the iX, iX3 and iX1 already playing in their own niches. It has been a rapid expansion into the zero-emissions world for the brand. But what does it mean for the longest-lived BMW showroom model of them all?The range at a glanceModelsPowerFrom520i M Sport205bhp£50,755530e M Sport295bhp£59,455i5 eDrive40 M Sport335bhp£74,105550e xDrive M Sport483bhp£76,605i5 M60 xDrive593bhp£97,745Shorn of its predecessors’ diesel engines, the eighth-generation 5 Series range consists of two plug-in hybrids, two electric i5s and the entry-level 520i mild-hybrid petrol.There are three de facto trims for UK buyers: M Sport, M Sport Pro and M Performance (as represented by the range-topping i5 M60). The last two are distinguished by exterior styling elements (illuminated grille etc) and gain extra interior kit.In 2024, BMW also launched the i5 Touring, which is available in exactly the same specifications as its saloon counterpart, albeit with a small premium to pay.",

    "description": "The Packtalk Pro sits above the Packtalk Edge, which I have been using nonstop across three different helmets for the last three years, come rain or shine. The Pro uses the same form factor with its clever magnetic mounting system, and it also continues with the same intuitive button layout. I’ve been thoroughly impressed with the Edge, which continues to work perfectly well, but Big Bad Bikes sent us this latest unit to see what’s new. There are essentially three significant updates you get here, two of which are enabled by the incorporation of a new chip. The first of these is a new crash-detection system. I’m glad to report that I haven’t tested this fully, but the theory is that it detects when you have had a fall and then calls a pre-selected number if you don’t disable the prompt within 30 seconds. You do need to have your phone’s location data running full-time for this to work, and that does take a toll on battery life. The second new feature is that the device switches off if you leave it lying stationary for a while. As someone who constantly forgets to turn the communicator off, I appreciate this smart feature. It also switches back on when you move the helmet, although this can be manually overridden. Finally, there’s the move to new 45mm JBL speakers, which aren’t a massive improvement over the already very good 40mm speakers in the Edge but do get noticeably louder. The rest is the same as before, including excellent noise cancelling, voice recognition and long battery life with a convenient quick charging capability. However, the Pro does come in a new black colour, which I think looks better than the grey Edge. Larger 45mm speakers are noticeably louder. At Rs 43,999, the Pro costs about Rs 6,000 more than the Edge, which is a reasonable increase when you think that just the 45mm speakers alone cost Rs 11,000 when purchased as an extra. At the same time, while the Pro’s added features are nice to have, I wouldn’t call them absolute necessities. Whichever one of these two admittedly expensive devices you end up picking, you will have what I rate as the best Bluetooth communicator out there.

    "description": "Spending an extended period with the Audi Q3 Sportback helped me explore its true character – a car that effortlessly blends luxury, sportiness and everyday usability. The journey has been a delightful one, filled with scenic drives, moments of pure driving pleasure, and a few quirks that add personality to the ownership experience. Whether it’s cruising on smooth highways or taking detours down lesser-known inner roads, the Q3 Sportback has proven to be a capable and stylish companion. For someone like me, who constantly seeks out beautiful and less-travelled roads, the Audi Q3 Sportback feels like the perfect partner. One of my favourite drives has been the route from Mumbai to Nashik. While most travellers stick to the straightforward National Highway 3, I find joy in exploring alternate paths that weave through the serene landscapes of the Sahyadri mountain ranges of the Western Ghats. It’s versatile enough to explore uncharted territory while keeping its occupants comfy. On one such adventure, I veered off NH-3 near Kasara and took a quieter road connecting to the Trimbakeshwar highway. The Audi Q3 Sportback handled the varied terrain with ease, delivering a smooth and composed ride. Whether it was cruising on flat stretches or navigating twists and turns through scenic hills, the Q3 Sportback maintained a perfect balance of comfort and control. I must say I really like the way the Q3 Sportback looks. One of the most striking bits about it is its Turbo Blue exterior, which grabs attention wherever it goes. The sleek, coupé profile, accentuated by aluminium inserts, gives the car a sporty and premium look. Though the sloping roofline does contribute to its striking design, it comes at the cost of rear-seat headroom. Knurled knobs for the air-con and volume control have a tactile feel. The cabin exudes a futuristic vibe thanks to its sharp dashboard design and high-quality materials. One of my favourite elements is the manual air-conditioning controls, with knurled knobs that operate with a satisfying click. It’s a small but thoughtful touch that enhances the tactile experience of the driver’s seat. The 530-litre boot capacity, which matches that of the regular Q3, offers ample storage space. Whether it’s luggage for a weekend getaway or daily errands, the boot has always been sufficient. The rear seat is fairly comfortable; taller passengers might find it a bit cramped in the back, but it’s not a deal-breaker for someone like me, who spends most of the time behind the wheel. Under the hood, the Q3 Sportback is powered by a 2.0-litre TFSI engine that perfectly complements its sporty demeanour. The engine’s versatility is one of its highlights – it’s equally at ease cruising at low speeds as it is revving up to its 6,000rpm redline for a spirited drive. The silky-smooth performance ensures a stress-free drive during long-distance trips, while the engine’s eagerness adds a fun factor when the road opens up. The 2.0 TFSI engine is very refined; it loves to be revved to the redline, especially in manual mode. The suspension setup deserves special mention, too. While it leans slightly more towards comfort, it doesn’t compromise on handling. This dual character makes the Q3 Sportback a pleasure to drive across different types of roads. It absorbs bumps well on uneven stretches while offering stability and confidence when cornering. While my overall experience has been positive, a few minor issues popped up during the long-term stint. One notable instance was when the key fob battery ran low, triggering a warning message on the instrument cluster. Fortunately, replacing the battery was a simple task that only required popping the key open with a screwdriver. Small quirks like these are part and parcel of long-term ownership, but they didn’t detract from the overall enjoyment of driving the Q3 Sportback. The reversing camera is not very sharp and doesn’t offer a 360-degree view. Living with the Audi Q3 Sportback has been an enjoyable and rewarding experience. It’s a car that excels in multiple areas, offering a great mix of luxury, practicality and driving pleasure. Whether it’s the excitement of exploring lesser-known routes or the convenience of urban commuting, the Q3 Sportback handles it all with poise. Its stylish design, comfortable interior and capable engine make it a compelling choice for anyone looking for a premium compact SUV with a sporty edge. As I look back on my time with the Q3 Sportback, I can confidently say it has been a reliable and fun companion. Now that this long-termer has been handed back, Audi has been kind enough to replace it with its bigger sibling, the Q8. More exploration coming soon!

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mercedes-maybach-s-680-night-series-review-night-in-shining-armour-434699#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Car+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "When it comes to luxury cars, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class has long been a benchmark, offering a level of refinement that is hard to beat. The new Mercedes-Maybach S 680 Night Series takes that opulence to another level, combining elevated luxury with distinctive dark accents and the power of a V12 engine. Mercedes-Maybach S 680 Night Series exterior Dual-tone Onyx Black and Mojave Silver paint 20-inch alloy wheels The Night Series offers exclusive exterior dual-tone paint combinations. While the Maybach S 680 shares much with its lesser S-Class counterparts, the Night Series edition adds a host of unique design features. These include unique paint shades, like the striking dual-tone Onyx Black and Mojave Silver pairing. Subtle touches, such as rose gold accents in the headlamps and dark chrome elements in the grille, further add to its exclusivity. The 20-inch wheels, whose seven spokes are surrounded by dozens of Maybach logos, also complement the car’s visually commanding presence. Mercedes-Maybach S 680 Night Series interior Aluminium strips run on the dash 31-speaker Burmester sound system Step inside, and the S 680 Night Series instantly envelops you in a world of luxury. The dashboard boasts a herringbone wood pattern, with subtle aluminium strips running through it. A central console area, finished in glossy piano black, features the Maybach logo embossed in a classy, understated manner. The attention to detail continues with a wood-and-leather steering wheel and quilted leather seats; black is the only upholstery colour in the Night Series. The back of the front seats feature the same intricate pattern as the central console. The herringbone wood grain with aluminium accents looks sophisticated. Every element in the cabin has been carefully designed, from the Night Series branding on the door sills to the plush, high-pile carpets. Ambient lights flash lane change alerts When it comes to features, the S 680 Night Series offers a laundry list of cutting-edge technologies aimed at both comfort and safety. One standout feature is the ambient lighting, which not only looks stunning but is also functional. The system is actively integrated with the car’s lane-change warning system: if there’s something in your blind spot, the lights flash as a reminder to check your rearview mirror before changing lanes. The 3D instrument cluster adds a modern touch to the traditional dashboard, providing a floating effect. And on top of that, you have everything from a panoramic sunroof to a 31-speaker Burmester sound system, massage and ventilated seats, rear seat entertainment screens, wireless chargers at the front and rear, and just about everything you can think of. Mercedes-Maybach S 680 Night Series engine and performance 0-100kph takes 4.5 seconds Silky smooth V12 engine is the highlight in this variant. The moment you close the doors and start the engine, the S 680 demonstrates its refinement. One of the most noticeable aspects of the car is the silence inside the cabin. It’s as though the outside world fades away as you’re cocooned in a bubble of tranquility. Strong power delivery for a 2.3-tonne car While this may seem like a car built for comfort, it’s far from just that. The S 680 is equipped with a 6.0-litre V12 engine, producing 612 horsepower and an astonishing 900Nm of torque. When you punch your foot down on the pedal, the power delivery is strong. To put it into perspective, this 2.3-tonne car does 0-100kph in just 4.5 seconds. However, the power is delivered in a progressive manner, where acceleration and gear shifts are all delivered smoothly. Nothing ever feels aggressive, staying true to its focus on comfort and luxury. Mercedes-Maybach S 680 Night Series acceleration timesSpeed (from rest)Time (in seconds)20kph0.8640kph1.5760kph2.4180kph3.44100kph4.69120kph6140kph7.58 Individual mode customises suspension, steering and performance The S 680 makes high-speed cruising effortless. At triple-digit speeds, the car feels entirely composed, eating up miles without breaking a sweat. This smoothness is further enhanced by its adaptable driving modes. The Maybach mode prioritises comfort, ensuring a pillowy-soft ride, while the Sport mode injects a bit more responsiveness into the car when you need it. For those who like to fine-tune every aspect of their driving experience, the Individual mode allows you to customise the suspension, steering, and performance to suit your exact preferences. Rear-axle steering is great Handling is another area where the S 680 excels. Despite its large size, the rear-axle steering system allows you to manoeuvre the car like a much smaller vehicle, making U-turns and tight spaces a breeze. The steering itself is well-calibrated, providing a light, responsive feel for city driving while offering more weight and confidence when cruising on the highway. Mercedes-Maybach S 680 Night Series comfort and ride 180mm extra legroom than standard S-Class First-class levels of luxury; long wheelbase lets you recline fully, with enough room to stretch your legs. Though the S 680 comes with a V12 under its hood, it’s clear that the rear seat is the real star of the show. This extra-long-wheelbase version offers an additional 180mm of legroom, creating an expansive space that’s as comfortable as it is stylish. The Night Series comes with the First Class Suite package, which means rear passengers can enjoy fully reclining seats at the touch of a button, complete with a leg rest that unfolds to provide private jet-level relaxation. Fridge keeps beverages chilled The back seat features large screens for entertainment, a tablet for controlling various features, a wireless charging pad, sun shades and a full suite of massage functions. If that’s not enough, there’s even a fridge to keep your champagne cool, with two champagne flutes waiting to serve. Ultra-soft pillows add to the plush experience, making long trips feel like a retreat. Refrigerator eats into the boot space but is removable. With the car in Maybach mode, the ride is incredibly smooth, absorbing most imperfections on the road. However, larger potholes or deep ruts can still cause a noticeable thud, reminding you that even the finest of cars can’t beat our roads. Mercedes-Maybach S 680 Night Series price and verdict S 680 priced at Rs 3.48 crore; Night Series pricier by Rs 40 lakh The Maybach S680 Night Series isn’t just a car; it’s an experience. From the sophisticated design and cutting-edge technology to the extremely refined comfort and smooth, strong performance, this flagship sedan represents the pinnacle of automotive luxury. Of course, such indulgence doesn’t come cheap. With a price tag of Rs 3.48 crore (and another Rs 40 lakh for the Night Series package), the S 680 is truly a car for those who demand nothing but the best. But, as they say, all good things come at a price - and in the case of the Mercedes-Maybach S 680 Night Series, it’s a price worth paying.

    "description": "The Volkswagen Tiguan R Line India launch has been officially confirmed for the second quarter of 2025, alongside the Golf GTi. The R Line is the range-topping version of the latest-gen Tiguan that was revealed globally back in 2023. It is expected to arrive here as a full import, which means pricing will be on the premium side. Tiguan R Line India launch confirmed for early Q2 2025 R Line variant gets sporty exterior and interior cosmetic elements Engine specs, technical details yet to be officially confirmed Volkswagen Tiguan R Line exterior and interior Gets illuminated LED light strips and sporty bumpers  As the range-topper of the Tiguan line-up, the R Line variants get sportier front and rear bumpers, a rear spoiler and side panels in R Line design spec. Additionally, it also gets full-width horizontal LED light strips at the front and rear, and larger 19-inch alloy wheels. Customers overseas also have the option of speccing the car in a Black Style package, but it remains to be seen if Volkswagen offers it in India. On the inside, the Tiguan R Line variants come equipped with sports seats and an ambient lighting package with three light zones and 30 colour options. As standard, the Tiguan R Line comes equipped with a 10.3-inch digital instrument display and a 12.9-inch central infotainment screen. The dashboard has a clean and upmarket look, and the infotainment systems use the latest version of VW’s MIB4 software platform that can receive over-the-air updates. Left-hand drive model used for representation only. In terms of dimensions, the Tiguan R Line measures 4,539mm long, 1,639mm tall (without roof rails) and is 1,842mm wide – 30mm longer with a similar width as the previous-gen SUV on sale here. Its wheelbase, at 2,680mm, also remains the same as before. Volkswagen Tiguan R Line platform and powertrain India-spec powertrain yet to be confirmed  The new Tiguan is based on the MQB Evo platform, and is available with a range of mild-hybrid, plug-in hybrid, petrol and diesel engine options internationally. In the UK, the range starts with a 150hp, 1.5-litre mild-hybrid petrol engine. Then there’s a 204hp, 1.5-litre plug-in hybrid, a 265hp, 2.0-litre petrol and a 150hp, 2.0-litre diesel engine – the latter two also getting 4Motion all-wheel drive systems. All engines come mated to either a 6-speed or a 7-speed DCT. Volkswagen India hasn’t confirmed which of these will be brough to India, but the higher-spec 2.0-litre petrol engine can be expected in keeping with the premium billing of the SUV. For reference, the existing Tiguan in India is available with a 190hp, 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine with all-wheel drive and a 7-speed DCT. The Tiguan is priced at Rs 38.17 lakh (ex-showroom, India), but expect a significant mark up in price for the next-generation SUV that’s arriving in a higher-spec.

    "title": "The Perfect Elixir: Lab Eleven",
    "link": "",
    "description": "﻿ \"If a car sits too long, it starts to die.\" That is the ethos at Lab Eleven. No over-polished baubles. No overbuilt tech experiments masquerading as classics. Just 911s built to be used, built to last, and built to keep showing up for its only job, to be driven. The restomod world has a habit of missing the point. Somewhere between the bespoke interiors and the carbon fiber everything, a lot of builders lost track of why people love these cars in the first place. The formula has gotten predictable. Strip a 911 down to its studs, load it up with more power than anyone will ever use, tweak the suspension until it stops feeling a bit bitey, and then call it an improvement. It isn’t. It is just progress for the sake of it, and progress does not always move things forward. Lab Eleven is not interested in better for the sake of automotive performance theater. They are interested in better for the sake of driving. Pino La Rosa and his daughter Milena run their shop in Milan the way you would expect from people who actually care about these cars. Every Lab Eleven build starts with an accident free 993 and gets stripped down. What happens next depends on the car and the owner, but the process is always the same. Make it sharper, stronger, and more usable without killing what makes it a 911. \"We are not here to make a completely different car, we are here to make the best possible version of the car that already exists.\" That means no unnecessary gimmicks. No touchscreens, no pointless tech, no desperate attempts to make an air cooled car feel like something that rolled off a production line yesterday.  \"You should still feel the road, still hear the engine, still know what the car is doing beneath you.\"  The engines are rebuilt in three stages. A 3.6, a 3.8, or a 4.0 liter pushing anywhere from 300 to 400 horsepower. It is more than stock but not excessive, just enough to make the car feel alive. This may turn things into a bit of a handful for the rear engined uninitiated, but never more than one. Some panels are swapped for aluminum or carbon fiber, but only when it improves balance and durability. There are no qualifying laps that reward weight savings, and Colin Chapman is not breathing down your neck as you roll out of your garage. The goal is not to shave grams off a control arm or hub. It is about balance. Inside, they stick to materials that belong, wool fabrics, houndstooth, and leather that looks and feels right. Somewhere along the way, the restomod scene evolved into a competition to build the most expensive cars and coffee accessory. Machines that flick their blinkers a few times before arriving at an asphalt prison, only to be tucked back into a temperature controlled garage, polished with an overpriced orbital, and plugged into a twelve volt battery tender, the automotive equivalent of life support. Lab Eleven builds cars that need to be driven. Lab Eleven cars belong on alpine passes, winding back roads, and long stretches of open road where dirt and rock chips are part of the experience. A Porsche was never meant to be perfect. It was meant to be driven, to wear in, to collect the marks of use that prove it is alive, and when the time comes, you pass it on, imperfections and all.

    "title": "How (Not) to Rally Scout in the Unkillable Mercedes W123",
    "link": "",
    "description": "Another car bought sight unseen, another “gotta own this one someday” box checked. It also ticked the “probably definitely won’t break down” box, a critical facet for this purchase. The job? Scout the ’22 Overcrest Rally: 10 days, 8-10 hours a day, and thousands of miles, all in one state. Idaho. The 1979 300TD was rough but rust-free, and as my grandfather would say with a touch of irony, “a smooth runner with a straight body.” Despite its quirks, the W123’s legendary reliability and patience testing pace made it the perfect scout vehicle for the rally.   Most of the state is seen from a 72 mile jaunt across i90. A stretch easily defeated by those that would often rather be “there” than wherever “here” was. In about one episode of a podcast it's over and everyone is on to Spokane, Seattle, Portland, or some far off distant easterly place where pizza and bagels are made just right. No one hops off to venture inland to try some finger steaks or french fries from potatoes pulled out of the ground a few hours earlier. There are no grandma's huckleberry pies on the interstate either. But Idaho's uniqueness goes beyond just the food, it has roads. Some of the best one's you'll ever get the pleasure to find. Idaho proudly wears the Sawtooth Mountains at its heart. At the state’s beltline lies Boise, the capital city that initially wasn’t even on our radar. It lay too far below the squiggly tarmac and unknown mud and gravel of the forest roads. Before heading up there, the car needed a few things. It was the crest of summer, and the air conditioning didn’t work. We needed to install the European headlights that came with the car or we couldn’t bear our own existence. It didn’t have a roof rack, which seemed like a shame, and Jasin, the co-driver, a quiet, sharp, and witty man, wanted a bicycle in case we got stranded somewhere. “Dude, We are not going to need a bicycle. This thing is the most reliable vehicle ever made” “We might.” “We won’t…” Despite the w123 being the most reliable vehicle ever made, we ended up looking for a bike. After a bunch of “is it availables” we still ended up just going to a Pocatello pawn shop. We now had a bike (and cooler for Dews) on our roof rack. The air-conditioning swallowed up some cans of r134, and with some hotwiring of the compressor, we had ac. There was no power with it on, but we had it. 77hp with it off, and probably 65 with it at full chat. The vacuum system controlling the HVAC in the car was shot and screwdrivers were shoved through the vents to hold the blower flap open. It was the only way to get air flow. The fact that each one was essentially a guaranteed death by being impaled in an accident wasn’t lost on us, but aircon is aircon, the bastion and oil gilded holy grail of any old shitbox. If you’ve got it, you’re a king, and we had it. Us kings, royal purveyors and surveyors of the almighty road trip. May all without it bow before our superiority, piety, and condescension.  Far up into the mountains, we were met with snow. It was somewhere between \"no problem\" and \"big problem\" in depth, located a two-hour drive from where we’d started, and just 100 yards from the summit. The other side of the summit, and our route out, was right there. You could have hurled a stone and hit dirt on the other side. It was the answer to all of the “do we really want to drive 2 hours backwards?” considerations. The easy answer to this was no. No we did not. This route was supposed to be on the rally, which meant we’d have to drive back the other side just to check it out. The 30-40 yards of snow that swept across the mud was dense, and slushy, the last vestige of a long winter at 9000 feet. Making it through would save half a day of driving. The bike loomed. “What do you think?” “Not great.” “Not great… yeah.” “Should we make a run at it?” “Sure, why not.” Why not was that it was a really bad idea. At that altitude that car, even with the AC off was gutless. Maybe 50 hp. When it was new. 270k miles ago. The gearshift dropped into low and the old OM617 wheezed without spinning the tires in the mud towards the snow. There was no climax, no “ope, he might make it.” It was beached with just a few yards to go. The bike loomed again. Hours passed and after the digging with the top tray of a toolbox got tiresome the conversation got closer and closer to riding back down the mountain. In the middle of the debate a truck rounded the bend. After a chat the driver realized he wouldn't make it through either, but he did have a tow strap. Kings saved by mere mortals, a story for all time.  “Told you we wouldn’t need the bike.” On the way out, some sort of celestial car karma kicked in and the right front caliper seized. The roads were slick with rain and the car was not doing well downhill.  A call out to social media didn’t help and we were forced into heading to Boise to hit up a junkyard. There, the two wrench trick and some elbow grease yanked a caliper off an old w114 250C. It was pure luck the car was there and we knew it. This was the land of Bumpside Ford’s, not the land of vintage German tanks.  On the way out the door of the yard we spotted another w123 parked right next to ours. A turbo diesel sedan with a lot of miles. This thing had been around the block, a million times. It was well worn. The US headlights were in rough shape with one side missing the bezel, and the other side about to be.  The caliper got chucked in the backseat for later We knew exactly what we had to do. Working fast, we yanked the Euro-spec H4s out of their boxes, uninstalled the very nice US-spec lights, and swapped them out. Just as we finished, the owner of the million-block W123 walked up. As is often the case the man looked a bit like his car. He’d seen a few things and his weathered skin and thin wild hair spoke of it.   “Love your car sir.” “Thanks a lot.” “Hey so we noticed you maybe needed some headlights.” “Yep, thats why I was here, but no luck.” “I tell you what, take these.” “What do you want for them?” “Nothing.” The man thanked us, took the headlights graciously, hopped in his car, and clattered away. It's possible we got stuck and that caliper got seized for a reason.  Incredible roads were in abundance. Warm Lake Road, a monument to loneliness, curling up and up eternally, forcing us to shove snow in the engine compartment to keep going. White bird grade. A high bedrock set of switchbacks set in the hills below Grangeville. Both were empty. No one ever came, and it was ours for every mile. These roads are not in your backyard, and it takes significant effort to get out that far past the border of what people consider nowhere, but it's worth it, when you find out they’re all yours.    Continue...",

    "description": "This 1955 Austin-Healey 100S is one of 50 examples of the production alloy-bodied sports racer built in 1955 and was delivered new to the US through Royston Distributors in Philadelphia. Chassis AHS-3802 was campaigned in 1955 and 1956 by its first owners John and Evelyn Mull, the latter of which published a 1958 account of women in racing entitled Women in Sports Car Competition. The car was sold to its next owner in 1957 before being acquired by a Navy Commander, who brought it with him to New Zealand upon his reassignment in 1958. It remained in the country and was raced until the late 1970s before being relocated in 1981 to Australia, where it is said to have spent time on display in a museum before being entered in various vintage events through the late 1990s. The roadster was returned to the US in 2000 upon the current owner's acquisition and underwent a multi-year refurbishment by Fourintune Garages of Cedarburg, Wisconsin, in the early 2000s that involved a repaint replicating its factory white and blue paint scheme as well as a later rebuild of the 2.7-liter inline-four, which features an aluminum-alloy cylinder head. The car is further equipped with a four-speed manual transmission, Dunlop four-wheel disc brakes, and 15\" painted wire wheels as well as a Perspex windscreen ahead of vented-back bucket seats trimmed in dark blue upholstery. It received FIVA certification in 2002 prior to being driven in the 2002, 2005, and 2006 runnings of the Mille Miglia Storica in Italy and has since competed in various vintage events in the US including the Colorado Grand, Texas 1000, Copperstate 1000, and California Mille road rallies. This 100S is now offered on dealer consignment with owner's manual, an ownership chronology, service records, spare parts, and a clean California title.",

    "description": "This 2000 Ferrari 550 Maranello is a European-market example that was imported to the US and federalized in 2001, and it was acquired by the selling dealer after it was listed on BaT in September 2022 and relocated to Canada. Powered by a 5.5-liter V12 paired with a six-speed manual transaxle, it is finished in Rosso Corsa over black leather upholstery. The car is equipped with a limited-slip differential, a gated shifter, 18″ five-spoke wheels, a Tubi Style exhaust system, and Scuderia Ferrari fender shields as well as power-adjustable Daytona-style seats, automatic climate control, and a Blaupunkt Bremen stereo. A timing-belt service and fluid changes are said to have been carried out in preparation for the sale, and the odometer shows 16k miles. Previously listed by the selling dealer on BaT in April 2024, this 550 Maranello is offered again in Canada with manufacturer’s literature and accessories, service records, car and interior covers, spare parts, a clean US Carfax report, and British Columbia registration.",
