    "description": "This 1959 Lancia Appia GTE Zagato was distributed new through Max Hoffman in New York before being purchased by the former owner, Anatoly Arutunoff, in the early 1970s and driven in the inaugural Copperstate 1000, the Mitty, the Monterey Historics, and other events across the US. Chassis 2533 was sold by Mr. Arutunoff on BaT in September 2021 and brought to Canada, where it was acquired by the seller in 2023. Subsequent work involved re-trimming the seats in leather along with performing an engine tune-up, fitting a custom exhaust system, and dry ice cleaning the underside. The car features aluminum Zagato bodywork finished in white over a white and blue interior and is powered by a 1.1-liter V4 fitted with a single Weber carburetor and a four-into-one header. Shifting is through a four-speed manual transmission, and further details include covered headlights, a sliding-pillar front suspension, and 15\" steel wheels along with a wood-rimmed Nardi steering wheel and Veglia instrumentation. Previously listed on BaT in November 2024, this Appia GTE Zagato is offered again in Canada with a FIVA identity card, catalogs and vehicle literature, records dating back to the 1970s, spare and removed parts, and Alberta registration in the seller's name.",

    "description": "I love using my Suzuki Access to bop around the city. It’s comfortable, practical, frugal and zippy. So much so that I haven’t ever found myself wanting another commuter. That was until the Ather Rizta entered our long-term fleet. Ever since it arrived, my Access hasn’t seen much action, and in the month that I’ve spent with the Rizta, I’ve covered more than 500km. Two things that have made a positive impression on me in these early days are its enormous boot and intuitive regenerative braking. Its 34-litre boot is deep enough to fit in a lot of stuff, along with the big charger. The 34-litre boot here isn’t the biggest in the e-scooter game, but it’s almost double the size of the one on my Access (and most other ICE scooters). I’ve managed to fit in my fully packed Kriega sling bag and the bulky charger supplied with the Rizta, with room to spare. This is also the only e-scooter (besides the River Indie) that can accommodate an ECE-certified full-face helmet, which I think deserves praise. Unlocking the boot always needs two hands, which is frustrating on a daily basis. The trouble is that when I need to open the boot, it doesn’t unlock with just the twist of the key. I need to press down on the seat exactly where the locking mechanism is located with the key in the unlock position to get it to release every single time. This isn’t a big negative, but it is one of those things that gets mildly irritating with time. Another positive here is Ather’s Magic Twist feature, wherein the regen progressively slows you down when you twist the throttle backwards. This has proved to be quite a treat in Mumbai’s typically staccato traffic. At speeds below 40kph, with a bit of planning, I didn’t have to use the brakes and relied solely on the regen to stop.   Ather’s Magic Twist is intuitive and works beautifully well in city traffic. But there is a problem here. Locking the rear wheel up is all too easy when you’re coming to a halt hurriedly. Part of that blame must be attributed to Mumbai’s atrociously slippery concrete roads, but Magic Twist and the rear brake working in tandem seem to enhance this tendency. This has forced me to actively pay attention to how much pressure I apply on the brake lever. Either that, or I avoid using the regenerative braking when coming to a halt quickly, using only the brakes. Barring these irritants, it has been smooth sailing with the Rizta, and I’m looking forward to adding more digits to the odo reading. Strong regen, along with rear brake usage, can cause the rear wheel to lock up easily. Nevertheless, the biggest advantage of any EV has to be the beautifully low running cost. Per my usage, I spend around Rs 1,000 on fuel every month with my Access, but using the Rizta, that number drops to roughly just Rs 120! Also See: TVS iQube S long-term review, 2,200km report",

    "description": "BMW Group names a new director for Mini UK and Ireland Welcome to Movers and Shakers, a new Autocar Business feature covering the latest job moves from across the automotive industry. This page will be updated regularly with all the biggest transfers, promotions and departures in the sector, covering everything you need to know. Name: David Beattie Company: Mini UK and Ireland Role: Director David Beattie has been named the new director for Mini UK and Ireland, replacing Federico Izzo, who has been promoted to lead the brand's European operations. Beattie has worked for the BMW Group UK since 2005 and most recently led its used car sales operation. Names: Sjoerd Knipping, Pablo Martinez Masip Company: Kia Europe Roles: Chief operating officer (Knipping), vice-president of product and marketing (Martinez Masip) Kia Europe has appointed a new chief operating officer and vice-president of product and marketing. Sjoerd Knipping (above, left), the new COO, has been promoted from his previous role as vice-president of product and marketing. He has spent more than 25 years working in the European automotive industry, having held several senior roles at Kia and Ford. Replacing Knipping as the vice-president of product and marketing is Pablo Martinez Masip (above, right), who has been Kia's global VP for customer experience since 2021. \"Going forward, our strong team supported by these executives will continue to move our bold transformation process to be a sustainable mobility solutions provider with a focus on our people and our customers,\" said Marc Hedrich, president and CEO of Kia Europe. Name: Christian Meunier Company: Nissan Role: Chairperson of the management committee for the Americas Former CEO of Jeep Christian Meunier has been named the new chairman of Nissan's management committee in the Americas. He will report directly to Nissan's new chief performance officer, Guillaume Cartier, who was appointed to right the ship after the firm's operating profits dropped by 90% during the first half of its 2024 financial year. Challenges facing Meunier include the threat of a 25% tariff on its cars exported into the US from Mexico, as well as a profitability slide that was in part caused by liberal discounting in the region. He spent 17 years with Nissan (between 2002 and 2019) before taking the top job at Jeep. He left the American manufacturer in October 2023 to \"take a long break to focus on personal interests\", according to an official Stellantis statement. Name: Damien O'Sullivan Company: VW Group UK Role: Managing director Volkswagen Group UK has named Damien O'Sullivan as its new managing director, with Alex Smith leaving after six years at the helm.  O'Sullivan will take the top job in Milton Keynes on 1 December, having run Audi in Ireland for the past three years. Prior to that, he spent time in various positions within the VW Group in China and Taiwan, having joined the company's sales division in 2009. Smith, who has been with the VW Group UK for nearly 15 years, is leaving the company \"at his own request\", according to an official statement.  His tenure as VW Group UK MD has coincided with one of the most turbulent and disruptive periods in automotive history, but he leaves the company in a strong position ahead of a transformative few years in which each of its brands are planning to launch crucial new models to the UK market. \"I’m very proud of everything the team and the networks have achieved in a period which has included Brexit, a pandemic, a supply crisis and the introduction of mass-market electromobility,\" said Smith.  \"With Volkswagen the UK’s number one passenger car brand, Audi at number two and both Skoda and Seat/Cupra achieving record market shares so far this year, as well as Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles in number two position in the van market, it feels like the right time to hand over to Damien to continue building on Volkswagen Group’s market leading performance in the UK.\" Name: Xavier Martinet Company: Hyundai Europe Role: President and CEO Dacia marketing chief Xavier Martinet will become the next president and CEO of Hyundai Europe. Martinet replaces Michael Cole, who is retiring at the end of this year after four years in the top job. Cole, who has been with the Hyundai Motor Group since 2009, said: “After more than 40 years in the automotive industry, it is now time to return to the UK to be with my family and to enjoy life beyond work. “I have been incredibly fortunate to enjoy a career in such a dynamic industry and over the last 15 years to work at Hyundai Motor Group, the best and most progressive automotive organisation in the world. “I am proud to have worked with a great team in Europe, who l know will ensure that Hyundai continues its exciting growth trajectory.” Name: Christophe Georges  Company: Bentley  Role: Board member for sales and marketing Bentley has promoted sales and marketing director Christophe Georges to a seat on its executive board.  Georges joined Bentley in 1998 and has held several key positions since, including two stints as its president and CEO for the Americas region.  “I am relishing the prospect of continuing to work closely with my colleagues to provide fresh momentum and direction as we grow our brand, our audience base and our entire sales and marketing operations,” said Georges. Bentley CEO Frank-Steffen Walliser added that Georges is “perfectly placed to realise our brand and sales ambitions”.  Name: James Crichton Company: Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Role: Regional director for the Middle East and Africa James Crichton has been named Rolls-Royce’s next regional director for the “hugely important” Middle East and Africa region.  Crichton has held a number of senior positions at the luxury car maker since 2010 and has worked as the general manager of its global sales operations for the past six years. Julian Jenkins, Rolls-Royce’s director of sales and brand, said: “I am delighted to welcome James Crichton to his new role as regional director Middle East and Africa. “James has more than 14 years of experience with Rolls-Royce Motor Cars and has held several leading positions in the company during this time. “This latest move to Dubai reunites him with the regional office he was asked to establish in 2011. “Middle East and Africa is a hugely important region for our business, and I wish James continued success in his role leading the excellent team which serves the region.” Name: Maria Grazia Davino Company: BYD Role: Regional managing director for Germany, Switzerland, Poland, Austria and the Czech Republic Maria Grazia Davino has been announced as the new regional managing director for BYD in Germany, Switzerland, Poland, Austria and the Czech Republic. The news comes days after she stepped down as managing director of Stellantis UK – a position she held since July 2023. Stella Li, executive vice-president of BYD, said: “We are thrilled to welcome Maria Grazia to our team. Her extensive experience and visionary leadership will be pivotal as we continue to grow and innovate in the European automotive landscape.” Name: Eurig Druce Company: Stellantis UK Role: Managing director Eurig Druce has been named the next managing director of Stellantis UK, replacing Maria Grazia Davino. Druce has worked in what is now Stellantis since 2001, having started as an apprentice with Peugeot UK in 2001. He spent three years heading Citroën’s British arm between 2020 and 2023 before serving as sales chief for Stellantis UK. He was named Peugeot UK boss in July 2024 and will continue in that role until his replacement is found. Jean-Philippe Imparato, who was recently named Stellantis’s new chief operating officer for the Enlarged Europe region, said: “I am delighted to be able to appoint Eurig Druce to this position. His proven track record in the country will provide continuity of our strategy in this important market.”",

    "description": "Honda has infused fresh life into the Amaze, its compact sedan, with a significant update. As Honda’s current bestseller in India, the Amaze carries high expectations, especially following the lackluster performance of the Elevate and the decline in sales of the City. This third-generation Amaze arrives just in time to face off against the all-new Maruti Dzire, which not only boasts an updated powertrain and features but also wears a coveted five-star Global NCAP safety rating. While the Amaze now looks sharper inside and out, it retains its predecessor's powertrain. To bolster its safety credentials, Honda has equipped the Amaze with a camera-based ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) suite, instead of relying on external crash test certifications. Front styling resembles the Elevate with its upright grille and chrome treatment. With prices ranging from Rs 8 lakh to Rs 10.90 lakh (ex-showroom), the new Amaze is priced above the Dzire (Rs 6.79-10.14 lakh). Interestingly, Honda will continue selling the second-generation Amaze in lower-spec petrol-manual variants to cater to budget-conscious buyers. Also, while there’s no factory-fitted CNG version, customers can opt for a dealer-installed CNG kit for an additional Rs 1 lakh, covered under Honda’s warranty. It looks like a barely shrunken City from the rear. Styling updates align the new Amaze with Honda’s latest design language. The upright grille and chrome detailing give the front a resemblance to the Elevate, while the rear looks like a barely shrunken City. The side profile remains unmistakably Amaze, but new elements like door-mounted mirrors and wider 185/60 R15 tyres with diamond-cut alloys add freshness. The overall dimensions are similar to the second-gen model, but the width has grown by 38mm, improving road presence. New Honda Amaze interiors The Amaze adopts a minimalist dashboard layout, echoing the Elevate's design, but without premium touches like soft materials or faux wood accents. The 8-inch touchscreen, though functional, feels small by modern standards. However, the beige-black cabin colour scheme does elevate its appeal to some extent.  The dashboard is identical to the Elevate, but it lacks the faux wood panel and soft touch bits. The beige-black interior theme adds brightness, and Honda’s hallmark ergonomics shine through with well-placed storage spaces and excellent visibility. Also carried forward from the Elevate are its superbly executed part-analogue, part-digital instrument cluster, as well as the neat, buttoned climate control console. Thigh support is inadequate at the front; the centre armrest is sorely missed. The front seats lack sufficient thigh support, and the absence of an armrest is likely to hamper driver comfort on long drives. The rear seat offers good support and a comfy backrest angle, but the narrow cabin width makes accommodating three adults a challenge. Taller passengers will also find headroom limited. On the upside, the Amaze now features rear air-conditioning vents, three rear headrests, three-point seatbelts, and class-leading 416 litres of boot space. New Honda Amaze ADAS, features The talking point of this new-gen Amaze is its camera-based ADAS suite, which includes lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, autonomous emergency braking, and blind-spot monitor, among others. The lane-keep assist function activates only once the vehicle speed crosses 72kph, and it works seamlessly when both lanes are clearly marked. The rear seat is supportive and comfy; headroom is in short supply for taller passengers. Adaptive cruise control works well in stop-go conditions, too; however, in the manual version, gear shifts will deactivate cruise control. The blind-spot monitor displays a video feed of the left side of the vehicle on the screen upon using the indicator or activating this feature manually. While it is very useful, it takes up the whole touchscreen display, and while using maps, particularly, this can be a bit inconvenient. Lane-keeping assist works seamlessly on a clearly marked road. Additional equipment includes six airbags, wireless charging, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, rain-sensing wipers, and auto LED headlamps. However, missing features like a sunroof and a 360-degree camera are likely to give the Maruti Dzire an edge. Also, while there are a couple of USB Type-A ports in the front as well as 12V power sockets in the front and rear, there isn't a single USB Type-C port to speak of. New Honda Amaze performance A familiar 1.2-litre petrol engine continues to power the Amaze. This is a very rev-happy engine, with its power flowing only higher up the rev range. It builds pace only beyond 2000rpm, and from thereon, you can feel prominent tugs in power along the rev band, with a particularly strong pull beyond 4500rpm, almost all the way until 6700rpm. But there’s simply no getting away from its weak responses below 2000rpm.  The CVT (auto) masks this engine's weak bottom end very well; gets Sport mode, and paddle shifters too. To counter this and improve drivability, Honda has shortened the first and second gear ratios of the 5-speed manual gearbox. Despite this, it warrants constant downshifts in slow-moving traffic, on steep slopes, and also while trying to drive off from speed breakers. The third gear is quite tall too, which, coupled with the naturally aspirated petrol's weak midrange, does warrant a downshift to second for quick highway overtakes. Thankfully, this gearbox is smooth and has short throws, and even its clutch pedal feels light and effortless.  Soft suspension results in a fair bit of body roll around corners. Its CVT (continuously variable transmission) automatic complements this engine well and masks its weakness by keeping it in its optimum power band at all times. But with a heavy foot, this belt-and-pulley transmission will portray the typical ‘rubber band effect’, wherein the engine revs rise without a corresponding effect on the vehicle’s speed. It also gets a Sport mode, which keeps the transmission in a lower ratio, thereby extracting the most performance out of this engine. Its paddle shifters are nice and reactive and particularly useful when there’s a need for engine braking.  Cabin sound insulation could have been a bit better though, and engine, road, and ambient noises filters through a fair bit. New Honda Amaze ride and handling The soft suspension compresses a fair bit under full load, so you'll need to cross speed breakers with caution, despite its 172mm ground clearance. The Amaze’s suspension setup leans towards comfort, soaking up smaller bumps with ease but struggling over sharper potholes. Ground clearance has improved slightly to 172mm, but a fully loaded car can cause the rear suspension to compress significantly, requiring caution over large speed breakers. Wider tyres enhance grip, but body roll remains pronounced due to the soft setup. Steering is well-weighted and consistent, and a tight turning radius (4.9m on top variants; 4.7m for the base variant with 175/65 R14 tyres) makes city driving effortless. New Honda Amaze verdict The third-generation Amaze builds on its predecessor’s strengths with updated styling, better safety tech (ADAS), and improved practicality. Its CVT variant stands out as the smoothest automatic in its class, effectively masking the engine’s weaknesses. However, the absence of certain features like a sunroof and the higher pricing could deter some buyers. While it doesn’t feel as compelling as the mighty Dzire, the Amaze remains a solid choice for those seeking a well-rounded compact sedan and is likely to remain Honda’s bestseller in India.

When we arrived at bike night this summer to the typical rows of two-wheeled steeds, it was our friend Wookie’s 1972 Chevy K/5 Blazer taking up space that got our attention first. A topless 4×4 wrapped in iconic ’70s lines all hugging a 350 V8 struck us as the perfect idea: a summertime, beach-going, drive-in date movie-taker/baby-maker and backwoods overlander all in one. Of course, our friend had an even better idea that particular night, adding one more dimension to the Blazer by ditching the bench seat and dropping the gate for a little extra space. Now he had a two-door convertible SUV pickup, perfect for hauling a complementary ’70s enduro in canary yellow.…",

Among them were our friends Marc Holstein and Christine Gabler; a formidable German photography duo with a deep love for Japan and her culture. With an invite to the much quieter setup day, Marc and Christine captured the show’s most intriguing machines in vivid detail, before returning the next day to document the colorful whirlwind that is the Mooneyes show.

    "description": "The Kia Syros will debut in India later this week and add to Kia's compact SUV line-up. The Syros (codenamed: AY) is more premium than the Sonet – which has a similar sub-4-metre footprint – and will come with new features. Prices are expected to be announced in January when the compact SUV's showcased at the Bharat Mobility Expo. Kia Syros will have more rear-seat space and features than Sonet Deliveries are expected to begin by late January Syros to get an EV variant at a later stage Kia Syros exterior design Visually, the most distinctive element about the Syros is its tallboy, boxy design that’s intended to open up more room inside. It gets a clamshell bonnet that houses a 2D Kia logo, under which sit vertically stacked LED headlights and Daytime Running Lamps. There’s generous use of black cladding across over the wheel arches and bumpers. The alloy wheel design is also new and could measure up to 17 inches on top variants. Teasers reveal a break in the window line at the B-pillar, which seems inspired by the Skoda Yeti. It also gets a sharp, distinctive kink for the rear quarter glass, flush fitting door handles and L-shaped high-mounted tail-lights. Kia Syros interior and features Kia says the Syros will offer a “lounge-like” experience on the inside, with “futuristic features and an innovative seating layout”. Kia also stated that rear seat space will not only surpass the Sonet's but also the bigger Seltos. Further, it will include reclining rear seats, a feature that's currently exclusive to the Hyundai Venue in this segment. The infotainment system is expected to be a 10.25-inch unit in the top trims, and it will also likely have a full-digital instrument cluster. Teasers have also previewed a new two-spoke steering wheel with buttons to control the infotainment system and terrain modes (Mud, Snow/Wet and Sand), front parking sensors, wireless charger, USB-C ports, panoramic sunroof and an ADAS suite as well. Kia Syros: engines, expected price The Syros will be powered by Kia's familiar 120hp, 172Nm 1.0-litre turbo-petrol and 116hp, 250Nm 1.5-litre diesel engines with their respective manual and automatic gearboxes. However, the naturally aspirated 1.2-litre petrol mill that's offered in entry-level Sonet variants will not be offered in the Syros in keeping with its more premium positioning. Being slotted above the Sonet, whose turbo-petrol variants range between Rs 9.63 lakh and Rs 14.91 lakh (ex-showroom), we expect the Syros to debut at around Rs 10 lakh and max out at over Rs 15 lakh. This may lead to overlapping with some variants of the Seltos. Also See: Maruti Grand Vitara sales cross 2.5 lakh units since launch Tata Nexon EV, Curvv EV purchased this month get free charging",

    "description": "South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Group recently revealed that it has collaborated with Google to deliver next-gen navigation and infotainment experiences in its new vehicles. Additionally, sister brands Kia and Genesis will also benefit from the partnership, with drivers getting access to information about 250 million locations globally. Google makes over 100 million updates to Maps each day Partnership seeks to enhance the Group’s software edge Development of software-defined vehicles (SDVs) to be sped up Notably, the announcement came before Hyundai’s shift to the Android Automotive Operating System (AAOS) for infotainment duties in 2026. Google OS designed for cars differs from Android Auto, as the latter just mirrors a phone’s screen on the infotainment system. This shift, part of the collaboration, will help Hyundai secure an innovative edge in the software-defined vehicle (SDV) technology space. AAOS-run infotainment systems are currently used in Honda, Renault, Ford and Volvo cars. Chang Song, president and head of Hyundai Motor Group’s Advanced Vehicle Platform (AVP) Division said, “Hyundai Motor Group is developing technologies in the field of SDV and mobility to provide customer-centered values. Our partnership with Google will serve as an opportunity for us to broaden our coverage of technology in the mobility market and providing greater values to customers.” Instead of directly applying Google Maps service to its cars, Hyundai aims to increase navigation accuracy by blending Maps’ Platform Places API (Application Programming Interface) and providing the latest data about locations, including business hours, contact information, ratings, reviews and more, reported a South Korean news outlet. Speaking on the collaboration, Jorgen Behrens, vice president and general manager of Google Maps Automotive said, “Every day, we make over 100 million updates in Google Maps to help people find fresh and comprehensive information about where to go and how to get there. By integrating our extensive database of places into Hyundai Motor Group vehicles through the Places API, we’re empowering drivers with the knowledge they need to navigate confidently, and we look forward to working with Hyundai Motor Group to bring more innovation to the fleet in the future.” Also See: Hyundai India to have 50 fast charging stations by end of the year Maharashtra enforces high-security plates for pre-2019 vehicles",
