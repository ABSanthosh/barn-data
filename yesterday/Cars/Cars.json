    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/business-corporate/stla-career-what-legacy-will-carlos-tavares-leave",
    "description": "Tavares (left) took over as CEO of PSA (Peugeot-Citroën) in 2014 Stellantis chief steps down after a storied career steering the car world's biggest firms The guy who did the extraordinary and stitched together 14 disparate car brands into a single company has announced his resignation. Stellantis is facing its first major financial wobble since it was created in 2021 through the merger of PSA Peugeot-Citroën and FCA Fiat Chrysler but, even so, it’s hard to imagine the company without Carlos Tavares. He had already decided to retire in early 2026, a decision made “after listening carefully to my wife and my kids”, but has already handed in his resignation and will leave the company with immediate effect. The search continues for the successor to run a company that Tavares himself essentially created. Ever since the Portuguese executive took over as CEO of PSA Peugeot-Citroën in 2014, Tavares has played an outsize role in the global automotive industry. This was the executive who made running a global car company look almost easy and he delighted industry watchers by keeping up a running commentary as he applied his own spartan management style to whatever mess he found. “The bad news is there is red ink everywhere. The good news is that it's obvious why,” Tavares said on his first public appearance as CEO of PSA, while sat next to the man ultimately responsible for the financial mess: Philippe Varin. Tavares worked by cutting costs to expose the underlying profitability. “Treat company money as if your own” was the underlying motto to employees, as heating and air-con dials were turned low or even off throughout the expanding empire. Tavares was applying lessons absorbed while working at Renault-Nissan as right-hand man to Carlos Ghosn, 'Le Cost Cutter' himself.  His exit from Renault-Nissan was classic Tavares: he made it known publicly he wanted to be CEO. That was either going to result in an internal succession process to take Ghosn’s job or what actually happened: antagonise his boss to the point where he was forced out. But it also advertised Tavares’s ambitions to the world, hedging an otherwise risky bet.  Ghosn and Tavares both had an obsession with cost control but differed in their management approach. “Carlos Tavares prefers to let people compete; Carlos Ghosn had more control,” said one executive who worked with both men. The executive spoke under condition of anonymity. If Tavares learned his craft under Ghosn, in creating Stellantis he was fulfilling the dream of another industry titan – the former FCA boss Sergio Marchionne. It was Marchionne who warned in his 2015 treatise ‘Confessions of a Capital Junkie’ that car makers had to consolidate to have any hope of controlling spiralling development costs. In 2017 Tavares moved on Vauxhall-Opel, relieving General Motors of seemingly insurmountable financial problems and then rapidly returning the business to profit. The enlarged PSA was now Europe’s number two car maker.  Emboldened, Tavares then oversaw the merger with FCA that created the 14-brand behemoth and promised combined annual savings of €3.7 billion (£3bn) from building multiple models that shared platforms and even factories. Today, the results are visible in their purest form in the Jeep Avenger, Alfa Romeo Junior and Fiat 600, three small cars on the same platform built in a former Fiat plant in Tychy, Poland. That all three look so dissimilar is a testament to Tavares’s skill in separating brands. “Carlos is a product guy in a way that Ghosn wasn’t,” said Andy Palmer, who worked alongside Tavares at Nissan. The cost-cutting, the synergies and the relentless focus on plant efficiency resulted in big profits: €16.7bn in 2022, rising to €18.6bn in 2023.  But the pressures of balancing the demands of multiple brands and three legacy centres in the US, France and Italy, all while overseeing a legislation-led transition to EVs, has piled the pressure onto Tavares. The worst hit to his leadership abilities came from the company’s abrupt warning in late September that it would ship 200,000 fewer vehicles than planned in the second half of the year into the North American market, a company cash cow thanks to the Jeep and Ram brands. This was “self-inflicted”, Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said in a note to investors. Tavares blamed the slump in sales on a “poor US marketing plan” for the second quarter. He’s less willing to take the hit for upheaval in Europe, where the company is struggling to sell EVs at a low enough cost to both appeal to the buyer and maintain healthy profit margins for Stellantis. “We have had a very harsh regulation imposed on us. The mess has not been created by the car makers, at least not by Stellantis,” Tavares said at Paris. His solution was to enact what some are describing as the “night of the long knives”, which resulted in the departure of the US head, the company CFO and the head of the European region. Some are not convinced that’s enough. “We expect investors to strongly question how the abrupt leadership changes will translate into tangible steps to put the company back on track,” Roeska said. Who will take over? From the outside, Renault Group CEO and rival turnaround king Luca de Meo is top of the pile of potentials. From within, the newly promoted Jean-Philippe Imparato, the former Alfa Romeo CEO who becomes the new head of Europe, is a strong candidate, as is Maxime Picat, a former European head who’s now the company lead on purchasing and supply chain.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/why-i-love-renault-scenic-more-any-ferrari-or-lamborghini",
    "description": "My love of cars wasn't sparked by a Lamborghini, but a humble Renault I’m sure that most of us who love cars happen to have developed that fondness because of one particular car in the family and one core memory hinged around it. I reckon that it usually stems from pretty early – those moments between learning to walk and writing your name – and it very often turns out to be quite mundane, at least on reflection. For me that would be the Renault Scenic. Ours was a Mk1 facelift (or Phase Two, in Renault speak). I couldn’t tell you which engine it had nor what year it joined the family, but I can tell you it was finished in maroon red and had colour-matched plastics. Quelle beauté. My mum bought it at some point in 2002 or 2003, wanting something bigger than our Skoda Fabia for when my younger brother came along. I wasn’t bothered by any such practicalities, of course. All that really mattered to me, as a two-ish-year-old, was that it was an interesting colour and had fold-out tables in the back. I’m fairly certain I was sold on it when my parents bought a portable DVD player and a copy of Monsters, Inc and plonked it in front of me. Some of my earliest memories are of watching various Pixar flicks as we drove overnight to some backwater caravan park for a holiday, trying to watch through the glare of amber street lights outside. I’m sure my mum and dad enjoyed the (relative) silence they’d have got as a result, too. When all I really knew of cars was that they went brum-brum, those flimsy fold-out airline tables were an absolute game-changer. Fantastic as the new Scenic might be – I’m sure it’s wonderful, having heard many positive things from colleagues – it doesn’t have the flat-pack activity tray/dining area and is therefore dead to me.  I’m not normally one to be offended by the re-use of old names on completely new products: I couldn’t really care less about Fords Capri and Puma becoming chunky SUVs. But a Scenic without tables? That one stings a little. Sadly, my family’s time with the Scenic came to an abrupt end one morning in 2005 when, for reasons never explained, the engine fell out. I always thought it had gone in dramatic fashion on the M25, but no, its fate was rather less interesting. It just happened to give up one night, parked outside our flat. After some argument, Renault bought the car back and gave us a handsome deal on a 1.2-litre Clio fresh off their demo fleet. It lasted my mum 13 years and 40,000 miles, but it was no Scenic. Bring it back again – and do it properly this time, please, Mr de Meo.",

    "description": "Someone wise recently told me: “A watch tells more than time.” Essentially, this means your watch is an extension of yourself, and different watches fit different people's personas. That saying is actually quite fitting for this bike – the gorgeous Royal Enfield Goan Classic 350. It isn't too different from the Classic 350, but it's targeted at a rather different rider – someone who wants to be unique but doesn't want the compromises that come with this style of bike. RE Goan Classic 350: Design, changes to Classic Design is one of the foremost ways the Goan Classic differs from the standard Classic. Starting at the front, you've got these very retro-looking whitewall tyres, which are found only on a microscopic amount of bikes available on sale today. While the tyres have a retro look, a welcome surprise is that the Goan Classic runs cross-spoke laced wheels, which permit tubeless tyres. The tyres are CEAT’s new Zoom Classic rubber, developed specifically for the Goan Classic. While the front wheel is a 19-incher, like the bike it is based on, the rear wheel is a 16-incher in proper bobber fashion. Then, the Goan Classic trades the Classic's handlebar for tall ape-hanger bars that put your arms almost straight and in line with your shoulders. It also has more forward-set pegs from the Meteor 350, and together, these changes put you in a properly relaxed riding position. The Goan Classic is also the only RE 350 to get the metal switch cubes from the larger 650s. Even the exhaust muffler is new and has a bit of a raspy note to it. You also have a cantilevered rider's seat, which is just 750mm off the ground, making it the second-lowest seat on any Royal Enfield today, after the Super Meteor 650. But my favourite design element is this articulated rear fender that moves with the wheel. The logos and badging on this bike also align with the retro custom aesthetic and add that little bit of extra pizzazz to its design. The Goan Classic’s colour palette is very funky and out there, and those who like to make a statement with their bikes will like the paint options. There are four colours to choose from, but my favourite has to be the Trip Teal (nice naming, RE!). RE Goan Classic 350: Ride and handling, comfort So, how do all these changes affect the riding experience? The short answer is, not much. The Goan Classic feels very similar to the Classic 350, which is a very pleasant feeling, with the only difference being how you're seated. The tall ape hangers work rather well when you're riding, and there's no strain on your arms or shoulders. After a brief accustomization period, I found my rhythm, and I suspect it will be the same for most others. The only small caveat here is that while making a tight U-turn, you need to plan your movements correctly and be a little more mindful of the tall bars. And because of how you're seated on the bike, you'll also bear the brunt of bad roads a little more than the Classic. That said, the Goan Classic is nowhere as uncomfortable as its competitors from Classic Legends. Honestly, aside from the different riding positions, the rest of the riding experience is pretty much identical to the Classic 350. This means it's the same relaxed, comfortable, and smooth yet torquey bike we've come to know and loved over the years. RE Goan Classic: Verdict All in all, the Goan Classic 350 feels like a cut above the rest of the 350s in terms of fit and finish, quality, and uniqueness. This will also be reflected in its price, as it is the most expensive 350cc Royal Enfield. Prices start at Rs 2.35 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) and go up to Rs 2.38 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), making it Rs 5,000 - Rs 8,000 more expensive than the top Emerald Chrome Classic 350. With the Goan Classic, you're getting a very unique-looking thing with proven fundamentals, a custom bike straight from RE. So, if you're one of the few people who use their watch not just to tell the time but to make a statement, I think the Goan Classic will be right up your alley.

    "description": "Everything just has to be some form of SUV these days, right? And you know what – that’s just fine. If you want a sedan with lifted suspension, a curvy roof and a punchier engine, do it! It’s adding more sport to your life. If you want a lifted hatchback with boxy sides and a bit of cladding, go for it – it gives you greater utility. That’s S and U covered. However, if you’re an alumnus of the Old School – the type who believes that an SUV must have four-wheel drive, high ground clearance and tough underpinnings, that it must be able to climb mountains, ford streams and have ancestors that fought in actual wars – there are only a handful of SUVs on the planet that would fit the bill. And after years of trying, we finally have three of them together on the same loose clump of mud. They all pay homage to their legendary ancestors, some more directly than others. The Jeep Wrangler, Land Rover Defender and Mercedes G-Class are not rivals in the truest sense of the word. How could they be, with prices of Rs 72 lakh, Rs 1 crore, and Rs 2.5 crore, respectively? What they are, though, are the modern descendants of three of the most iconic 4x4s in history and are themselves pretty iconic in their own right. So, while we will compare how they perform on and off the road and what creature comforts each of them provides, we’re also going to see what makes each of them unique. Defender vs G Class vs Wrangler off-roading  What better place for these three to start proving themselves than in the rough? Though each is good enough to be a benchmark for mud plugging, as proven in our Off-Road Day group test a couple of months ago, each also goes about it very differently. To this end, the Wrangler is the most focused on the task at hand; particularly in Rubicon guise, it is the most outright capable off-roader in the bunch. A lot of that is down to its standard mud-terrain (M/T) tyres that sink their sipes into the loosest of surfaces to pull the Jeep out of places lesser SUVs would need a winch for. Then there are the disconnecting sway bars that turn it from a rhino to a rock crab, giving it articulation that no stock SUV on the planet can match. There is some electronic assistance, too, including the ability to choose your hill descent speed, but the Wrangler experience is a largely mechanical and analogue one. As you’ll see later, you pay the price for this on the road, but to buy purely as an off-roader, the Rubicon is the way to go. Rubicon’s tenacious grip and articulation are second to none. (R) Tactile and colourful off-road controls gamify the experience. At the very opposite extreme is the Defender, which almost feels too nice to take off-road. It’s the furthest removed from its utilitarian forebear, ditching the tough ladder-frame chassis and rigid suspension for a monocoque and air springs. Instead of levers and knobs, you engage the hardware with light taps of a button or via the touchscreen. The locking diffs, ride height and traction control are managed by computer and drive modes, and such a level of autonomy in off-roading can be daunting at first. Once you get used to it, it’s remarkably capable, though perhaps not to the unstoppable level the Wrangler is. The electronics can often take a moment to figure things out, but once the algorithm deploys, it takes the effort out of off-roading. It truly is plush through the mush, though for off-roading enthusiasts, it could be a bit anticlimactic. Defender has serious hardware but all controlled by software. Sometimes, it takes a moment to read the surface but soon gets you out of trouble. There’s nothing anticlimactic about the G-Wagen, which is an occasion on four wheels. There’s a weighty, mechanical invincibility to the way it off-roads that sets it apart from the others. Having the most powerful engine here – a 3.0-litre diesel with 700Nm – certainly helps, and you get the sense it can just muscle its way out of a tricky situation. You rarely have to lock any more than the centre differential – done via the now-iconic three switches on the dash – but if you lock all three, it will twist the very Earth beneath you. It can feel a bit top-heavy (and heavy in general) through some hairier obstacles, but chances are you will give up a lot sooner than it will. G-Wagen takes a ‘pummel everything into submission’ approach. And once all three diffs are locked, nothing can stop it. Defender vs G Class vs Wrangler on-road manners  Let’s face it, though. Any of these cars will be used more on the tarmac than off it, but even if you’re buying one of these to only go off-roading, you still have to get to the mud via the road. And while they’re all pretty incredible in the muck, out on the road, it’s a different story. It takes a certain amount of commitment to choose a Wrangler and even more so to choose the Rubicon, which, despite its best efforts at modernity in 2024, feels the most compromised on the road. At any given time, there are at least three different rattles in the cabin, the footwell is tiny with no dead pedal, and wind (and sometimes water) enters via gaps in the bodywork. And all that’s before you get to the M/T tyres and rigid-axle suspension, which together make for a less-than-pleasant on-road experience. Tyre roar is ever present, getting worse the faster you go, and the ride quality is lumpy at best and crashy at worst. That aside, you’ll have little to complain about when it comes to the powertrain, which, though a little boomy, feels strong enough for this car. Another big surprise is the steering, which feels light and affords the Jeep impressive manoeuvrability. While all three are incredible in the muck, they will be used more on the tarmac than off it.  It’s not a surprise that the Defender is the best-behaved on the road. Its platform, after all, is based on the previous Range Rover’s, and with cushy adaptive air suspension, it rides like a dream. It’s also worth pointing out that it gives you the most choice – three body lengths, six seating configurations and five engines. This 300hp, 2.0-litre petrol is the smallest, though it doesn’t feel inadequate; you can also have a diesel or even a 635hp V8, with a corresponding increase in price, of course. It’s the best handling, too, with progressive steering and decent body control, especially if you put it in its Dynamic mode. It’s no sports SUV, but its monocoque setup makes it far more agreeable going fast around corners than the other two. Once again, the G-Wagen falls neatly between the other two. Yet, it is a force to be reckoned with, stronger than either of them. Though it has a ladder-frame chassis, it’s not as fidgety as the Wrangler but also nowhere as smooth as the Defender (or any other Mercedes SUV, for that matter). It doesn’t so much ride over bumps and potholes as it forces them to bend to its will. The seating position feels the tallest and most upright, perfect for lording over lesser vehicles. Its straight-six diesel is surprisingly smooth and easily the strongest, and yes, there’s the 585hp V8 AMG should you want more poke still. There are drive modes to unlock a bit more responsiveness, though they make little difference to the ride. No, it’s not a handler, though it has to be said it feels very stable at high speeds, almost as much as the air-sprung Defender. Defender vs G Class vs Wrangler design, interior and features To a layperson, the G-Wagen may as well be the same one that debuted in the late 1970s; such is its devotion to its original look. The truth is, this is an all-new generation that debuted in 2018, which, though still quite traditional under the skin, has seen the benefit of some modern tech. This includes Mercedes’ dual-screen infotainment system, although not the newest MBUX software and not even a touchscreen – these will come with a facelift next year. Quality and craftsmanship, however, are where you feel your money’s been spent, with lashings of contrast-stitched leather, metallic trim and carbon-fibre inserts – though I suspect some of these are optional extras; go figure. The Adventure Edition does add a bit of visual drama with mud flaps, a roof rack and a ladder, but even without this, the G has a uniquely towering presence. No shortage of bling, and quality is excellent. Retains an old-school feel. But, rear-seat comfort is not up to big luxury SUV standards. The other two aren’t far behind, mind you, and the Defender, especially – with its different body styles and exterior specifications – likes to let everyone know you’ve arrived. Yes, it looks a little like the original, but modern renditions of the original’s signature motifs – round headlamps, small tail-lamps and the roof-mounted ‘safari windows’ – are nice retro callbacks. On the inside, quality might be a little shy of the Mercedes, especially some of the plasticky switchgear, but it’s still ‘luxury-car’ good. And like on the outside, it does a modern interpretation of the classic cabin and offers loads of practical storage. It’s big on tech, too, with the latest Pivi Pro touchscreen being particularly slick to use, but they’ve helpfully kept some physical buttons in to make things easier to operate in the rough. The most practical, comfy and well-thought-out interior – front seat or back. Tech feels the most modern, and features list is long. Despite debuting a slick new 12.3-inch touchscreen, the Jeep has plenty of physical controls, too. In fact, it has a fun, almost toy-like dashboard layout that makes the other two look staid in comparison. There are lashings of red trim, fun iconography and plenty of Easter eggs littered around the cabin, and it suits its ‘off-road plaything’ personality well. Quality is still rather good, actually, and there’s even ADAS and a nice sound system, despite the fact that the doors and roof can be removed entirely. As a result, yes, they don’t shut (or shut the world out) in the same way the sophisticated Defender or vault-like G-Class do, but it’s all part of this SUV’s recreational nature. Quality and features impressive in an interior that can be stripped apart and hosed down. Rear seat low, firm and basic, to say the least. They all have large boots that can easily swallow up a couple of drinks coolers and weekend bags, with the Defender 110 getting an optional pair of small third-row jump seats that fold away. Of course, you can opt for the 90 or 130 versions if you want a more compact SUV or more seating space, respectively. Speaking of, the Defender’s second-row seats are the best, with the most space and the best comfort. The Mercedes feels comfy enough but too upright, while the Jeep seat feels low to the ground with not enough padding or support. Defender vs G Class vs Wrangler verdict They’re not rivals, so we don’t have to pick a winner, right? Well, yes and no. While their prices aim them at different buyers, there could be some overlap – perhaps if you could afford them all. They are united by their all-conquering abilities off-road, and each has a presence and desirability that would make anyone proud to park them in their driveway. But, since each has carved out its own rut, let’s see which one’s best at what. The Jeep makes some compromises to comfort in its quest to be the ultimate off-roader, and though there is a more user-friendly ‘Unlimited’ version, if you’re getting a Wrangler, it’s really the tough-as-nails Rubicon that you want. Thanks to local assembly, it comes at a (relatively) reasonable price, and for that, you get the greatest stock 4x4 in the world! How about that? If you feel an SUV should be able to ford streams, climb rocks and fight wars, these are the SUVs for you. The Gentleman’s Express that is the Land Rover Defender is more concerned that your tea doesn’t spill as you’re cresting that rock face. It’s determined to make off-roading as comfy and effortless as possible, and to that end, it feels more like it was designed to save you from a sticky situation rather than go out in pursuit of one, as the Wrangler might. Moreover, it’s the best one for the road, which, let’s face it, is where any of these cars will spend most of their time. If we’re talking strictly in superlatives, the G-Wagen is the one to go for. It does off-road well, on-road well enough, and absolutely kills it in the desirability stakes. Without forgetting its tough roots, it has managed to feel sufficiently plush on the inside, too. No wonder it’s the subject of so many rap songs. But we’d be remiss not to call out that inflated price, which, only a few years ago, was a full Rs 1 crore less! Inflation is one thing, but this feels like a cynical ‘but hey, if there are willing customers, why not!’ On balance, then, it’s the Defender that gets our vote. It does everything extremely well and nothing too badly, and best of all, it gives you so many options to make it your own. And all this at a relatively reasonable price that’s bang at the heart of the big luxury SUV market, and you can see why it’s JLR’s bestselling product in India by far.

    "description": "Lamborghini will not follow Aston Martin and Bentley in delaying its EV plans. However, the Italian supercar brand will keep selling its existing three hybrid models for as long as possible. Lanzador EV will be an addition to Lamborghini line-up Lamborghini still has “enough” time to rethink on EV debut Lamborghini’s current global line-up is fully electrified  Lamborghini confident on its EV strategy In an exclusive interview with our sister publication Autocar UK, boss Stephan Winkelmann said he was confident that the firm’s previously outlined electrification strategy was “the right one” because when it comes to launching EVs, “it’s not about innovation, it’s about coming at the right time”. “When we decided to do the first step of our strategy, to have all the line-up new and hybridised, this was a big effort for the company,” he said. “For the last four years, we have worked very hard on this, and now we see that this was – you never know, but – the right decision. Therefore, we think that to be very focused on a step-by-step approach on [electrification] was the right decision.” Winkelmann said that because Lamborghini’s first EV – developed from the segment-bending Lanzador concept of last year – is an all-new model rather than a replacement for any current car. There is less risk of it impacting the company’s sales volumes, and it could even increase them. “We have enough time to decide if we need to accelerate or delay the introduction of the electric cars,” he said. “So far, we are not thinking about delaying anything. We said we want to have our first electric car by the end of this decade, and this is something which we will continue to foster, because we said it has to be an additional car - a fourth model.” Nonetheless, Winkelmann acknowledged that the curve of EV uptake is not “as steep as forecasted” and said this is “even more” true for the super-sports car segment in which Lamborghini operates, so the company’s strategy to “stay hybrid as long as possible is really the right one”. Supercar makers backtracking on EV plans  Winkelmann’s comments come after other low-volume car makers – including Aston Martin, Bentley and Ineos – pushed back their debut EVs in light of low demand for electric cars. Lotus, too, has backtracked on plans to go all-electric and will launch a new range of range-extender hybrids. Porsche is looking to extend the lifecycle of its current combustion cars in response to low EV uptake in the premium segment. Lamborghini line-up fully hybridised for immediate future  Following the debut of the Hurácan-replacing Temerario with a new electrified V8 engine, Lamborghini’s three existing model lines are now fully hybridised. And Winkelmann said the company won’t reverse its decision to go all-electrified, even if synthetic fuel proves a viable means of cleanly powering combustion engines in the future. “I don’t think that battery technology is going to step out of our cars because, at the end of the day, it is something which helps the performance, not inhibits performance,” he said. “And battery technology will evolve, and if we stay hybrid, this is going to help the performance of the cars even more.” The performance benefits of electrification are clearly helping Lamborghini’s customers to make the jump to hybrid power. The Revuelto, with its battery-assisted V12 engine, is sold out “well into 2026”, and the new Urus SE plug-in hybrid SUV is spoken for through to the end of 2025. Notably, while the Temerario is down two cylinders on its predecessor, it has a larger engine than its V6-engined rivals, the Ferrari 296, McLaren Artura and Maserati MC20, and Winkelmann suggested that size advantage plus the attractive aural bonus of a 10,000rpm redline will be a significant selling point for Lamborghini’s new entry-level model. “We cannot do the things for just one year; it has to last over a decade, mainly. And, therefore, it’s very important that our engineers are clever enough to put together the thresholds of what the outer world is giving you with the desire of our clients.” Also See: Aston Martin Vantage Roadster, Vanquish India launch in 2025 Toyota Celica return confirmed by vice president",

    "description": "Kia India is all set to reveal the Syros, its all-new compact SUV on December 19. Ahead of its global debut, we can confirm that the Syros will go on sale in January with not one but two engine options.  Syros will come with a 1.0-liter turbo petrol engine 1.5-liter diesel will also be sold alongside Deliveries likely to start by late January 2025 Syros to be fifth Kia model with a diesel engine While most carmakers are shying away from introducing new diesel-powered models, Kia India seems to be bucking the trend by launching its fifth product in India with the diesel engine. The Syros will come with the tried and tested 1.5-litre diesel engine that powers many Kia and Hyundai models in the country. This engine delivers 115hp and 250Nm of torque and sees duty in the Sonet, Venue, Seltos, Carens, Creta and the Alcazar in our market. As for gearbox options, the Syros diesel will come with a six-speed manual and a six-speed torque convertor automatic just like the one seen on the Sonet.  Syros will also come with a 1.0 turbo petrol The Syros will also come with a 1.0-liter turbo petrol unit good for 120 hp and 172Nm. It will come with a manual as well as a 7-speed DCT automatic gearbox. However, the Syros will not get the naturally aspirated 1.2-litre petrol engine that's available on the Sonet. This may result in a relatively high starting price, but that's also in keeping with the Syros' more premium positioning over the Sonet.  Syros launch and delivery timeline The Kia Syros will see a global debut on December 19. Sources tell us that a price announcement could take place in January, likely at the Bharat Mobility Show where the SUV will be shown for the first time to the general public. Expect Kia to start delivering the Syros to customers by late January or early February next year.

Major OEMs have turned to it, and other shows, in recent years—punting their wares to a captive audience to prove just how customizable their bikes are. The standard at Mooneyes is sky-high—so if you’re going to show up, you’d better come in hot. Royal Enfield has the right idea.

    "description": "Car shows are undeniably fun for anyone with a deep love for cars, but for regular attendees like myself, they can sometimes feel repetitive. Perhaps it’s the lack of innovation, the predictable formats, or the often unfinished projects on display.

    "description": "To keep a car running, change its oil every 3000 miles,” says 76-year-old Richard. His advice is nothing new, especially for anybody who owns an old Volkswagen, and he has applied this saying to his 1983 Volkswagen Beetle, which has served him for over 20 years. Some 20 years ago, Richard got a call from a friend saying that there was a Beetle for sale not too far away from him. He decided to take a look, and the moment he saw the Bug, he instantly fell in love with it. Continue...",

    "description": "Photography by: Johnathan Rothman (@thejohnrothman) 1956 Jaguar XK140 Convertible Raced in period by Briggs Cunningham and Denise McLuggage Location: California, USA Country of original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: S818207 Mileage: 76,025 miles Colour: Red Original colour of delivery: Carmine Red Price: Call for Price The car As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer a unique collector-grade Jaguar. The Jaguar XK140 represented the epitome of front-mounted 6-cylinder Jaguars in the mid-1950s. This particular example is without a doubt the most storied one in the United States of America, as it was raced and campaigned by two of the most prolific personalities in the American racing world. The car was first campaigned by renowned Briss Cunningham, who was indisputably one of the most pivotal figures in postwar sports car racing, making a profound impact as a driver, team owner, and constructor. Briggs then proceeded to donate his XK140 to Denise McLuggage, an American auto racing driver, journalist, author and photographer. She pioneered gender equality in motorsports and journalism in the U.S., and was among the very first women taking part in professional automotive racing. Her racing achievements included winning the grand touring category at Sebring in a Ferrari 250 GT in 1961, and a class win in the Monte Carlo Rally in a Ford Falcon in 1964. She also participated in the Nürburgring 1000 km sports car race. This car's past is in fact so fascinating that it recently enabled it to earn a very coveted spot in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (MSHFA), where it resided in 2022 alongside other giants of the racing world. What's perhaps even more remarkable, is that the car presents in unaltered condition. It's been kept 'as-is' by its 4 owners (Briggs Cunningham, Denise McLuggage, and 2 other owners, including the present one), and is showing a splendid amount of patina. Everything about this car is original and has remained untouched over the last 58 years - the chassis, body panels, engine, transmission, suspension, wheels, seats, dashboard materials, and more, are all original. And, magically, 58 years later, it still elegantly runs and drives. Continue...",
