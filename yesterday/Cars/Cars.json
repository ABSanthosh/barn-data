    "description": "The Tesla Model Y has been the best-selling electric car for several years, and the company has now updated it with fresh styling, an upgraded interior and more comfortable suspension. Is it still the electric car to buy?   Shall we talk about you-know-who? Actually, let’s not. Whatever you think of the company’s figurehead, the Tesla Model Y is an influential car that has topped a bunch of best-seller lists over the past few years. When such a significant car gets a major update, we’re curious what it’s like, and we assume you are too. The Model Y has been around since 2021 (2020 in the US). It getting facelifted after five years could almost make you believe that Tesla is a normal car company. The car’s had various updates to its battery and specification in smaller model year updates, but this is the one that you can actually see. The headline news of the Model Y ‘Juniper’ are the styling changes and some comfort upgrades. Let's take a look in the video above:",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/sketching-300mph-aero-secrets-hennessey-venom-f5",
    "description": "Hennessey Venom F5 is aiming to reach a top speed of 310mph-plus Designer of one of the world's fastest cars explains how designs can bend the laws of physics Ever wondered why so many supercars claim a ‘217mph-plus’ top speed? The McLaren P1, LaFerrari and Lamborghini Revuelto are just a trio of heavy-hitting examples. An easy, clean conversion to a mite under 350kph is one possible reason. Another explanation, however, is aerodynamics. “There’s an exponential increase in difficulty and complexity beyond 220mph,” says Nathan Malinick, Hennessey’s director of design. “Most hypercars can do that no problem, but 250mph and above remains very, very difficult. You have to know what you’re doing.” His most dramatic work so far is the Hennessey Venom F5, its target to be the fastest production car in the world. Its theoretical 310mph-plus top speed (itself a neat 500kph) will outstrip Bugatti and Koenigsegg should it come to fruition, but Malinick is only too familiar with the soaring aerodynamic challenges as you try to surpass the triple-ton – at which point you’re covering a mile every 12 seconds and pushing tyre technology to its very margins. Handily, his CV includes work in the aerospace industry. “We are a comparatively small company and we have to be extremely efficient. If our target was closer to 200mph then the requirements would be totally different. That’s still fast, but it’s nothing like 300, which is getting more into the aerospace side of things versus automotive,” he says. “There is quite a bit of crossover. From an aesthetic and philosophical standpoint, the F5’s interior is relatable to some of the cockpits that I was working on in my previous role. Simplicity drives a lot of what we do; on the exterior, it drove things in maybe unusual ways. One instance would be a lack of active aerodynamics, because we didn’t want to have an aspect of the car that would be susceptible to a failure at such high speeds. “You’re not going to see the flicks and blades of an F1 car on an F-35 or F-22 jet. Likewise, you’re not going to see them on our car because they contradict its purpose of top speed.” Supercars mostly sell on glamour, so how easy is it for Malinick to ensure his team’s designs are beautiful enough to be coveted by the collectors with the requisite millions to buy one? “We’re lucky to have creative engineers who recognise the value of design and want to support it, because ultimately people buy with their eyes,” he says. “The kind of people we’re talking to already have one of everything. Our car needs to pull on their heartstrings. “Our design and engineering teams work hand in hand. It’s not like we progress a design element and then say: ‘Hey engineering, take a look and see what you think.’ Feedback is in real time. We might need to stop and take something into CFD [computational fluid dynamics], or rapid-prototype something in the wind tunnel to ensure there’s no time lost. “The engineers are helpful in saying ‘this area of the car is not as significant, so do whatever you want here’. But sometimes our design will be dictated by function. Some of that is neat: a purely engineering-driven detail underneath the car that you’re not going to see unless it’s jacked up on a lift.” Despite its lofty goals and Malinick’s aerospace past, the Venom F5 can still thank pencil and paper for its design. “I do a ton of sketching,” admits Malinick. “It’s my favourite part of the process. I probably have thousands and thousands of sketches, whether it’s F5 or what we’re moving onto next.” It’s bait I can’t resist taking: what is coming next? He says: “If the F5 is all about performance, the next car is about driving interaction. It’s not going to be as powerful; it doesn’t need to be. \"The feedback we’ve had from customers and dealers has been really strong. It’s very much the antithesis to the digital age of cars we find ourselves in.” Does that mean it’s a manual? “If the customers come back and say ‘we want a DCT’, okay, that’s fine,” he says. “But as of now, I’d say it’s analogue to the nth degree.” Which suggests it will be free of the Venom’s turbocharging. “We’re still determining that,” says Malinick, “but we’re leaning towards something free of forced induction for the purity of it all. \"We want something very, very high-revving.” Sounds like a noble target to us.",

    "description": "Some motorcycle manufacturers have dipped their toes in the custom scene, but few have dived in head first like Royal Enfield. The Indian marque has made motorcycle customization a core component of its marketing strategy. That’s a bone-dry way of saying they sponsor events, fund custom builds all over the world, and then tell people about them. I’ve been watching Royal Enfield’s Custom and Motorsport department grow for the past few years and wanted a piece of the action. My magazine, Sideburn, has a long history with the brand. We built a custom Bullet back in 2012 when Royal Enfield was at the very beginning of their explosion in popularity and selling roughly one million fewer bikes per year than they currently do.…",

But when I think back on the projects that gave me the greatest satisfaction, most hail from the days when the experience mattered more than the final result. To stay grounded, it’s important to let loose every once in a while and do something just for kicks.

    "description": "As India’s off-road riding community grows, so does the need for purpose-built but cost-effective machines. KTM’s 390 Enduro R and Kawasaki’s KLX230 offer two vastly different interpretations of what an accessible, dirt-focused bike should be. While there’s a huge gap in their performance, their price tag is where they are quite close. Both claim to be proper off-roaders, but which one truly fits the brief? KTM 390 Enduro R vs Kawasaki KLX230: Design and features Both motorcycles are designed to go off-road but take a different approach The 390 Enduro R may appear like a stripped-down 390 Adventure at first glance, but look closer, and you can appreciate KTM’s effort to keep its design unique. Based on the 390 Adventure platform, it gets a larger 18-inch rear wheel, a smaller 9-litre fuel tank, less bodywork, and off-road oriented tyres. The plastic tank and black panels look a tad budget and don’t seem like they’d age too well. The 4.2-inch TFT on the KTM is packed with information but doesn't get a fuel gauge While the dirty white panels give this motorcycle a proper “enduro” aesthetic, the premature discolouration is a bit concerning. That said, the rest of the motorcycle feels solidly built. The switchgear quality is good and feels tactile. The tiny TFT display looks premium, and it shows most of what you’d want to see, except for a fuel gauge, which would’ve been handy while exploring remote trails. The KLX230's monotone LCD is quite basic and misses out on a gear position indicator. In contrast, the Kawasaki KLX230 feels solid and has durable plastics and a no-nonsense design. Discolouration seems to be a common theme, and the KLX230’s dual-tone seat gets dirty fairly easily. It gets an LCD with basic information and a simple layout. While it includes a fuel gauge, it skips a rev counter and gear position indicator – features you will miss but can learn to live without. The switchgear feels budget and a tad rudimentary. It’s also worth mentioning that parts like the mirrors, indicators and levers, which are likely to get damaged off-road, cost significantly more for the KLX as it is a CKD import. KTM 390 Enduro R vs Kawasaki KLX230: Ergonomics Both bikes are ergonomically compromised in their own way. At 860mm, the KTM’s seat height is tall but not extreme, and riders around 5’7” should be able to get the balls of their feet down. The Enduro R has a nicer seat and is the better option if you ever need to ferry a pillion. Standing up on the Enduro R feels more natural, and over time, you’ll prefer riding it on your feet. The Enduro R also offers decent mounting points for luggage, and it will definitely be the better option if you intend to cover bigger distances to get to interesting locations. A noticeable flaw is the engine guard that will bump your knees, nudging you to stand. The KTM is better suited for standing up and riding. The KLX230 has a similarly upright posture, but its ergonomics feel a bit too forward-set while standing, especially for taller riders who will want a higher handlebar. On paper, it has a taller 880mm perch, but once seated on it, the suspension sags enough that even riders around 5’7” can touch down easier than the KTM. However, the narrow and firm standard seat quickly becomes uncomfortable on the road. The 390 Enduo R also has slightly better seating ergonomics The more unusual challenge is getting the KLX230 off its stand – a task that needs to be done with the suspension unloaded, as the rear shock doesn’t allow the side-stand to retract when loaded. There are no built-in mounting points for luggage, but Kawasaki sells an accessory carrier. KTM 390 Enduro R vs Kawasaki KLX230: Performance and efficiency The 390 Enduro R outclases the KLX230 by a long shot in terms of performance This is where the two bikes couldn’t be more different. The Enduro R borrows its 399cc liquid-cooled engine from the other 390s and puts out the same 46hp and 39Nm – more than double the KLX’s peak output. However, on technical trails, this performance can be a bit much. Its motor doesn’t have much of a bottom end and then easily spins up the rear when the revs build. That said, the engine is decently tractable and rides well on the road with the same highway cruising performance as its Adventure siblings. Despite the tame nature, the 390 Enduro R is still a hoot on dirt. The engine may feel slightly tame for seasoned riders used to KTM’s raw nature, but that makes it surprisingly beginner-friendly. The Enduro R can cruise at triple-digit speeds all day and doesn’t feel out of place in traffic either. With its 9-litre tank, the KTM can achieve about 200km on a full tank in the real world. What makes the KTM even more manageable are its electronics – switchable ABS, a very effective off-road traction control, two riding modes, and a bi-directional quickshifter, all make life easier. Given the huge difference on paper, you’d expect the KLX230 to struggle, but it keeps up remarkably well off-road. It uses a simpler, smaller engine and there’s no sudden surge, but it has great bottom and mid-range. In fact, we definitely preferred this engine for off-road riding. Naturally, on road, the KTM easily leaves the Kawasaki behind, and anything above 90kph feels laboured; you also need to plan your overtakes. The lack of power allows the KLX230 to feel more stable and predictable off-road. Surprisingly, when ridden at higher speeds on- and off-road, there was only a 4kpl difference between the Kawasaki and the KTM. This is largely due to the KLX’s smaller engine that needs to work harder, and we often found that it needed filling sooner than the KTM. The KLX has no electronic aids apart from switchable ABS, but truth be told, it doesn’t need any. KTM 390 Enduro R vs Kawasaki KLX230: Ride and handling The KLX230 has much better off-road handling than the 390 Enduro R. The KTM gets adjustable suspension, but the India-spec bike gets reduced suspension travel compared to the export model, and we also found that the damping control can be improved. Ridden over the same rocky trails, the KTM is more bouncy and fights the same surfaces that the KLX glides over, which makes it tougher to manage. Reducing the compression damping to make it more compliant only results in a tendency to bottom out over jumps, so we elected to deal with the bounciness instead. The 390 Enduro R strikes a much better balance between road and off-road handling In tighter off-road sections, its 37kg weight disadvantage over the KLX also becomes noticeable and demands more from the rider. While the suspension lacks the plushness of the Kawasaki off-road, it shines on the tarmac. The Enduro R resists diving under braking, doesn’t squat under acceleration, and can be hustled in corners like a road bike despite its dual-purpose tyres. Thanks to the light weight, the KLX230 loves big jumps The KLX230’s suspension componentry is more basic, but despite that, it is far more capable off-road and soaks up imperfections with ease, giving riders more confidence to explore. It boasts 265mm of ground clearance, but that drops considerably with rider weight. The KLX is also more forgiving of rider mistakes, but push it, and it begins to show its limits, which is a reminder that neither of these bikes can be used for a very high level of off-road riding. On the road, the KLX’s dirt orientation is evident in the excessive front-end dive under braking. Yet, in our braking tests, the KLX was nearly on par with the KTM, thanks to its significantly lighter weight. The KLX230 corners surprisingly well The KLX changes direction easily, and it feels very light and nimble. However, its on-road handling is a bit vague and takes some getting used to. The MRF tyres are not bad, but the Mitas E-07s on the KTM are noticeably better. KTM 390 Enduro R vs Kawasaki KLX230: Verdict The KTM offers great value for just an additional Rs 6,000 At Rs 3.30 lakh, the simpler KLX’s value proposition feels a bit lopsided. It lacks features, and its highway manners aren’t comparable to the KTM’s. Kawasaki is reportedly working on a localised version, which could improve the price equation significantly, but that’s still some time away. Given the minimal price delta between the two, the 390 Enduro R makesa great case for itself. Still, the KLX230 is a charming little trail bike, and we enjoyed riding it off-road a lot more than the KTM. It’s unintimidating, lightweight, and promises to be reliable – the kind of machine that lets you explore and make mistakes without punishing you. As a second or third bike, it’s an excellent option. But as a one-bike solution? Only if you’re a true off-road maniac. For an additional Rs 7,000 over the KLX230, the 390 Enduro R offers higher performance, sophisticated electronics, and versatility. It’s more physically demanding off-road, but with enough skill and commitment, it will go where the KLX can while simultaneously being a more accomplished road bike. Its biggest shortcoming is its suspension, but KTM will bring in the international-spec longer-travel variant soon, albeit at a higher cost. For the small price delta between the two bikes, KTM’s 390 Enduro R makes a much stronger case for itself and is the better contender for a single-bike garage.

    "description": "Kush Maini converted pole position into a spectacular win in the F2 Monaco GP Sprint Race. This makes him the first Indian to taste victory at the iconic street track. Maini wins, 3.705 seconds ahead of Mini Secures first win with new team Dams Lights to flag win for Maini at Monaco Moves up to P13 in F2 championship Maini qualified P10 for the Feature Race, handing him pole position for the reverse-grid Sprint Race. After a clean getaway, he spent the majority of the race under pressure from fellow Alpine Academy racer Gabriele Mini behind him. He got some breathing room when the Safety Car was brought out on Lap 12 (to recover Joshua Duerksen’s car). Maini then aced the restart and pulled away enough to escape the DRS range from Mini. “I was struggling a bit with front locking, and one of my brakes fell asleep, so it was just not about going for the quickest lap this race, but about being consistent, and not making mistakes, and just controlling the race, which I feel we did,” Maini explained. He went on to take his second F2 sprint win, 3.705 seconds ahead of Mini. This is also his first win with his new team, Dams, and after a difficult start to the season, this comes at a crucial time to boost Maini’s confidence. “Obviously, this is the Sprint Race; we all want to win the Feature, but it’s still a win in Monaco. As a young kid from India, playing F1 on a PlayStation, I never thought I’d be here and winning in the second tier. So, really grateful, grateful to the team as well,” said Maini. “We’ve had a very rocky start, with a lot of things going wrong. Some things were in our control, some things not, but our season starts today, and there’s still a long way to go for us, so this is a positive note to take forward.” The win moves Maini up to P13 in the championship – 54 points behind the leader, Alexander Dunne. 2025 F2 Monaco Sprint Race results 2025 F2 Monaco Sprint Race resultsPosDriverTeam1Kush MainiDams 2Gabriele MiniPrema Racing3Luke BrowningHitech TGR4Jak CrawfordDams5Richard VerschoorMP Motorsport6Sebastian MontoyoaPrema Racing7Leonardo FornaroliInvicta Racing8Arvid LindbladCampos Racing9Alexander DunneRodin Motorsport10Ritomo MiyataART Grand Prix11Roman StanekInvicta Racing12Oliver GoetheMP Motorsport13Max EstersenTrident 14Amaury CordeelRodin Motorsport15Dino BeganovicHitech TGR16Sami MeguetounifTrident17Victor MartinsART Grand Prix18Rafael VillagomezVan Amersfoort Racing Also see: 2025 F1 Monaco GP schedule, India timings Kush Maini confirmed as Alpine F1 test and reserve driver",

    "description": "Mini India has announced a new scheme to pass on the benefits of any reduction in the Cooper S’ price to customers. It is called the Price Protection Assurance and is only valid on the Mini Cooper S, which is produced at the brand’s plant in Oxford, United Kingdom, and imported as a CBU.  The price protection programme can be availed at any Mini India dealer Mini Cooper S ex-showroom price range is Rs Rs 44.90 lakh-55.90 lakh India-UK FTA could result in a price reduction; hence the scheme Mini Cooper S Price Protection Assurance programme explained Cooper S buyers will receive benefits of any price reduction until 180 days after purchase Under the programme, the Mini 3-Door Cooper S buyers will receive benefits of any price cut until 180 days after the purchase. The programme is only available for a limited period and can be availed at any authorised Mini India dealership. The Mini Cooper S’ starting price is Rs 44.90 lakh, and it is available with the Classic Pack (Rs 50.45 lakh), Favoured Pack (Rs 53.40 lakh) and JCW Pack (Rs 55.90 lakh).   Speaking about the scheme, Vikram Pawah, president and CEO of BMW Group India, said, “Mini has always stood for innovation and a bold character. With the price protection assurance programme for Mini 3-Door Cooper S, we are staying a step ahead and ensuring that customers are able to receive the full benefit of any major price reductions resulting from anticipated duty cuts. They can buy their favourite Mini today and do not have to wait longer to make the purchase decision.” Do note that Mini’s press release adds that the all-electric Mini Countryman is not covered under the offer as it is built at the BMW Group plant in Leipzig, Germany.  Mini Cooper S price could reduce in the coming days India-UK free trade agreement could benefit Cooper S buyers As we’ve reported, some UK-made models being imported to India could see a price reduction with the recently signed India-UK free trade agreement (FTA). As per the pact, India will reduce tariffs on “high-end cars” imported from the UK from 100 percent to just 10 percent. However, both governments still need to clarify several details, and that has led to buyers being unsure of making their purchase. British brands in India, like Mini and JLR, are seeing fewer enquiries as customers are waiting to see exactly what it means for them. The Mini Cooper S price protection programme should help ease some of those uncertainties.

    "description": "Two years ago, we pit the petrol-automatic versions of the Hyundai Exter and Tata Punch against each other. Then, the Exter had the upper hand thanks to its smoother and more refined powertrain. Today, we revisit this rivalry, but with a twist: both sub-compact SUVs are here in their CNG avatars. While they share several traits, like a dual-cylinder CNG setup, a claimed efficiency of 27km/kg and premium features, including a sunroof, this time, the spotlight is on their real-world efficiency. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG interior and ergonomics  Let’s begin with the Punch. It’s easy to understand why this Tata is among the country’s bestselling cars. The basics are done right – its high-riding stance, wide-opening doors and easy ingress make it especially friendly for elderly passengers. The high seating position offers a commanding view of the road, and the visible bonnet edges further help drivers feel in control. The driving experience is enhanced by light steering, gear shifts that are easy to execute (though not as precise as the Exter’s) and a clutch that doesn’t require much effort. Further, individual front armrests enhance long-distance driving comfort, and a surprisingly impressive audio system adds to its appeal. There’s a lot that the Hyundai Exter CNG and the Tata Punch CNG have in common. Switching over to the Hyundai, it’s clear why it continues to earn praise for its user-friendliness. Every control, from the gearbox to the steering, feels lighter and more polished – just right for urban use. While its seating position isn’t as high as the Punch’s, outward visibility remains excellent, thanks partly to its lower window line. The fit, finish and overall cabin quality are marginally better than the Tata, but the dark, monotone theme doesn’t feel as inviting, and the seats leave a bit to be desired. They feel a little too compact and don’t offer the same level of support as the Punch’s. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG engine and performance  The Punch’s engine performance has never been its strong point, and in its CNG avatar, it feels even more sluggish. While it can keep pace with urban traffic, it begins to struggle when asked for more. The Punch’s real strength lies in its composure at highway speeds; it feels stable and reassuring, which is something it does noticeably better than the Exter. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG specsTata Punch icng Accomplished + sHyundai Exter hy-cng duo SX TechL/W/H3827/1742/1615mm 3815/1710/1631mmWheelbase 2445mm 2450mmBoot capacity 210 litres NAEngine 3cyl, 1199cc Petrol + CNG 4cyl, 1197cc Petrol + CNGPower 73.5hp at 6000rpm 69hp at 6000rpmTorque 103Nm at 3250rpm 95.2Nm at 4000rpmKerb weight 1181kg 1093kg On the move, the Exter feels extremely refined. The 4-cylinder engine is quieter and more eager to rev, and its overall smoothness is hard to ignore. Thanks to shorter gearing and smart engine calibration, you rarely need to shift gears. It pulls cleanly from as low as 1,000rpm, making it ideal for stop-and-go traffic. In our acceleration tests, the Exter Hy-CNG Duo sprinted from 0 to 100kph in 14.85 seconds, a full 3 seconds quicker than the Punch iCNG. Moreover, the Exter is significantly quicker than the Tata when accelerating from 20 to 80kph in the third gear and 40 to 100kph in the fourth. The Exter’s shorter gearing improves drivability but hampers highway efficiency to an extent. On the highway, though, the Exter doesn’t feel as composed as the Punch. There is noticeably more vertical movement over undulations. Also, its engine spins 300rpm higher than the Punch’s, at 3,300rpm, while cruising at 100kph in the top gear. This also explains why its highway efficiency is slightly lower at 30.3km/kg in our test, while the Punch iCNG’s is 31km/kg. However, the Hyundai returned 22.8km/kg in the city because of its better drivability, much higher than Tata’s 20.7km/kg. Both cars delivered an impressive overall average, close to their claimed 27km/kg figure.

We first ran both cars until their CNG tanks were completely empty. After that, we refilled approximately 2 kg of gas in each vehicle and drove them around in real-world conditions within the city until they ran out of CNG. Then, we repeated the procedure and ran them on the highway. Since filling the exact same quantity of gas in each car is nearly impossible, we’ve calculated their efficiency based on the actual distance covered divided by the gas quantity. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG features and safety  For the record, the Tata Punch featured here is the Adventure + mid variant, whereas the Hyundai Exter is in its top-end SX trim. That said, to keep this comparison fair, we’re evaluating both cars based on their respective top-spec versions. Interestingly, Tata offers a broader spread of variants with the Punch iCNG. Its entry-level trims are more affordable than Hyundai’s CNG offerings, though its higher trims are pricier than the Exter. Punch iCNG gets a spare tyre, while the Exter only gets a tyre repair kit. When it comes to features, the Punch iCNG impresses with additions like cruise control and a large 10.25-inch touchscreen, which the Hyundai misses. But the Exter hits back with key safety features such as six airbags, a tyre-pressure monitoring system, hill-start assist and electrically folding mirrors, all of which are absent in the Punch.

That said, the Punch’s boot feels a bit more usable, especially if both cars’ parcel shelves are removed. Moreover, Tata provides a full-size spare tyre, while the Exter makes do with just a tyre repair kit. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG verdict  To sum things up, the Tata Punch iCNG is a compelling option for buyers looking for an economical, compact and practical highway cruiser. Its tough build, elevated seating and great audio system add plenty of appeal. Where it falls short is in outright performance and the absence of key safety features like hill-start assist, tyre-pressure monitoring and additional airbags. The Hyundai Exter, on the other hand, is the smoother, more refined and easier-to-drive option in the city. It delivers better fuel efficiency, offers more safety features, and still manages to undercut the Punch on price – despite packing in more equipment overall. It may not lead the sales charts just yet, but it’s the Exter that feels like the better-rounded product, and for that reason, it’s the winner in this comparison.
