    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/brexit-beater-how-import-classic-car-europe",
    "description": "Brexit has made importing a car harder work but not impossible. John Evans meets a new Twingo owner to find out how it’s done In July 1993, Autocar put its money where its heart was and bought a first-generation Renault Twingo. Because the cute new city car wasn’t on sale in the UK, we had to buy a left-hand-drive example in its native France (price: £6500) and import it. Months of living with it justified our faith in the Twingo. Everyone on the team loved its styling, packaging, refinement and driving manners. Soon more of these quirky cars began appearing on UK roads. Now, 31 years later, another Mk1 Twingo, coincidentally also a 1993-reg model painted in Vert Coriandre, has arrived in Britain. It has done 80,000 miles but is in good condition. Explaining his reasons for buying and importing it, Nick Bailey says: “I’ve always been captivated by the first-generation Renault Twingo. While studying in France in 1993, I promised myself that one day I’d have one.” Unfortunately, at this point our old friend Brexit must enter the story. Prior to the UK’s departure from the EU, importing a car from Europe was fairly straightforward, but since 31 January 2020, it has been a bit more complicated.  Most people will go first to the UK government website’s page that explains how to import a car. A key requirement is that you must inform HMRC within 14 days of receiving it, using something called the Nova (Notification of Vehicle Arrivals) service. This also calculates how much VAT and duty is owed on the car. The rules concerning VAT are, at first glance, quite simple, with cars older than 30 years, no longer in production and unmodified attracting a 5% tax on their purchase price and younger cars a 20% tax. However, there’s also VAT to pay on shipping and on the import duty. The website says that importers can call HMRC to find out what they owe in taxes, but in October 2022 it stopped offering that service, and now someone wishing to import a car must employ an import agent to liaise with it. Usually for around £120, the agent will complete the relevant Nova sections and submit the evidence (original registration certificate, vehicle purchase and shipping invoices) that HMRC requires to calculate what is owed. On receipt of payment, HMRC will issue a C384 ‘application for release’ form enabling the importer to proceed to the next step: registering the car. Those less than 10 years old require a European Certificate of Conformity and a certificate of GB conversion IVA (Individual Vehicle Approval) confirming that the headlights and rear foglight, for example, are legal. Cars older than 10 years will have their lights checked during the MOT test. A speedometer that reads in MPH isn’t a legal requirement on cars older than 10 years. Cars more than 40 years old don’t require an MOT certificate, but importers recommend they have one to establish that they’re safe and to speed up the registration process. If the DVLA has any concerns about an older car with no MOT, it will have it inspected. Back to Nick. Early Twingos are increasingly sought-after in France, and on leboncoin.fr, France’s answer to eBay, Nick found his 1993 car priced at £3500. Deal done, his next job was to insure it. Insuring a foreign-registered car is usually no easy task for a Brit but, being fluent in French, Nick managed to negotiate a 30-day policy that insured him to drive not only in France but also to his home in the UK. Meanwhile, the import agent he used took care of the car’s import and registration applications. Including 5% VAT, the first registration fee of £55, £300 road tax and the agent’s fees, Nick paid a total of £1400 to have the car cleared for UK use.  Another enthusiast tempted by the prospect of buying a rare car abroad for a lower price than they would have to pay in the UK is Jeff Ruggles. He recently bought a 1977 Mk1 Ford Fiesta 1.1 S for £2100, also advertised on leboncoin.fr. To avoid insurance problems, he had a France-based friend buy and insure the car, who then sold it to him. Because insurance in France is on the car, rather than the driver, Jeff was able to drive the Fiesta to the exit port before, once in the UK, trailering it home. “The going rate for a UK car is around £5000, so I’m happy,” he says. “Because I already have an [Italian-made] Innocenti Mini, the Fiesta being left-hand drive is no problem to me.” The DVLA couldn’t tell Autocar how many used cars are imported from Europe and registered in the UK, but one agent, My Car Import, says it imports up to eight per week. “The low 5% VAT on older cars is no discouragement to enthusiasts seeking a rare vehicle in good condition,” says Will Smith, a director of the company. “Our transporter is out every week collecting cars.” Reunited with his now UK-registered Twingo, Nick Bailey is looking forward to getting to know the little car. One thing he won’t be doing is restoring it: “I’m doing a little bit of tidying up. Otherwise, I’m going to leave it dans son jus.”",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motorsport-f1/johnny-herbert-f1-drivers-use-guidelines-get-advantage",
    "description": "Grand prix and Le Mans winner Johnny Herbert talks about his career being an F1 steward and that crash The British Grand Prix, 1995, into the closing stages. For once, the cards have fallen in Johnny Herbert’s favour.  Damon Hill has bungled a pass on Michael Schumacher, leaving both the Williams and Benetton in the Silverstone gravel. David Coulthard in the other Williams had been a pest and got past, but a pit-lane speeding penalty has now knocked him back. Herbert leads. After everything, the operations, the setbacks, the endless physio, the constant pain… It’s been seven years since he mangled both feet and nearly lost one in that damned accident.  Now here he is, about to win his home grand prix. But as usual, he’s distracted by the sheer effort of simply driving. “I was literally screaming in the car,” Herbert recalls today.  The toe that “got chopped off and stitched back on” was causing agony from the constant shift from throttle to brake, brake to throttle.  “I thought: I have to find a way to get around this. I cannot carry on. I could do left-foot braking, but braking is all in your ankles – and neither of mine move. In those laps at Silverstone I learned I could do one lap left-foot braking, two laps with the right foot, then another with the left.  That relieved the pain.”  Through the tips of his toes Instead of feeling the pedal through the tips of his toes and moderating pressure through his ankle like racing drivers normally do, Herbert had to rely on sensations through his knees and hips… Unnatural, but when you don’t have a choice, needs must.  The pain has never left him. He lives with it still today. At 60, “I’m lucky I’m not in a wheelchair,” he says. ‘Lucky’ is a word Herbert uses often. Given the state of his feet, that might seem strange. But from his perspective, it’s amazing he had a racing career at all.  Between 1989 and 2000, he started 160 grands prix – for Benetton (two spells), Tyrrell, Lotus, Ligier, Sauber, Stewart and Jaguar – winning three of them.  Then there was the heroic Le Mans win with the banshee Mazda 787B in 1991 that left him so exhausted with dehydration that he collapsed and missed the podium.  After Formula 1, he was second at Le Mans in three consecutive years (Audi, Bentley, Audi) and only retired from racing in 2012. So, lucky? Yes, okay. But he knows all too well – and so does anyone who saw him on racing’s nursery slopes, before that cursed day at Brands Hatch in the summer of 1988 – it could have been so much more.  Imagine Johnny Herbert with two good feet. Today, he loves heading back to where it started, trailering and spannering his own kart to run in open sessions at tracks such as Shenington.  Being a driving steward Dropped from Sky’s F1 coverage two years ago, he could simply fall back on his hard earned elder statesman status, but instead puts himself up for abuse on social media as one of F1’s regular driver stewards at grands prix.  Why? “I enjoy it,” he says. “The ins and outs, the little games played by teams and drivers.” He’s learned to live with the trolls. That’s just as well because he has recently made headlines.  He was the driver steward at the Mexican and Brazilian GPs, where we all saw the worst and best of Max Verstappen.  Herbert and his steward colleagues handed out a pair of 10-second penalties to the Dutchman in Mexico for driving Lando Norris off the track. It was the right call – but when Herbert was later critical of Verstappen’s driving, the champion spoke of British media “bias”, and dad Jos – whom Herbert replaced at Benetton at the end of 1994 – waded in on “a conflict of interest”.  We won’t repeat some of the abuse Herbert received here. He firmly answers the criticism, pointing out he never speaks publicly when the FIA shirt is on his back. “On my weekdays, I’m still Johnny Herbert with an opinion and that’s never going to change,” he says in answer to Verstappen Sr’s charge.  “Should I be told to be quiet, as Jos has said? Well… no. He has his opinions, but he’s the father of the world champion. Should he [voice] an opinion about the team his son is driving for? Well, he can. He does. Is it right? I understand he only wants the best for his son.  “My opinion is only based on what I know as a racing driver. Then again, some say I only won three grands prix; what do I know? Everyone else out there, ex-drivers and otherwise, have an opinion. Why can’t I? Because I’m a steward, I’m not allowed to speak? But I don’t speak at the race weekend. I speak about it after I’ve finished my professional job, when my life carries on as normal.”  As for bias, he also has a point to make. On penalties handed down for racing incidents, the stewards follow strict guidelines laid out by the drivers themselves. “This is the thing: I don’t bring my 1990s self into the room and say ‘back in the day it was like this’,” says Herbert. “That doesn’t happen. I have to adjust to the modern day. You have all the rules and the guidelines and that is what you go by.” The problem, he says, is drivers are not only driving to the guidelines: they are also playing to them.  How Verstappen edged Norris off track at Turn 12 in Austin is a prime example. On the inside line, the Red Bull was ahead at the apex and therefore, according to the agreed rules, he did nothing wrong. So no penalty was applied.  “F1 drivers have so much awareness and mental capacity to know exactly what’s going on, and when extra rules get thrown into the mix, they use the guidelines to get an advantage,” says Herbert.  “This whole apex thing: the race is just to get to the apex first.” As for abusing track limits, Herbert admits it was less of a problem in his day when you had “kerb, grass, gravel”, or even “kerb, grass, catch-fencing” instead of acres of run-off.  Since this interview, the drivers met at the Qatar GP to discuss tweaks to the guidelines in response to the questions raised by recent incidents. There’s irony in the Verstappen spat, given how much and how often Herbert has expressed his admiration for the Dutchman, whom he classes along with Lewis Hamilton in the “super-human” racing driver bracket.  In fact, he’s deeply impressed by most of today’s generation. “F1 drivers have evolved. They are more complete than any from my era, including Michael Schumacher, because there are more tools for them to be perfect,” says Herbert.  “Max is unbelievably near perfect. Lando will improve: we haven’t seen the best of him either. It’s been a good season for him to learn about the games when you come up against the very best. It’s a really good time.”  Herbert draws a line from the greats of the past to those of today: from Stewart and Lauda, to those he raced against – Senna, Prost, his old team-mates Häkkinen and Schumacher – to Hamilton and Verstappen.  What he doesn’t say, but we can, is he could have been among them without that F3000 crash at Brands Hatch in 1988. I was there that day, just turned 14. I’d seen him win the Formula Ford Festival against the odds at Brands in ’85 and watched him blitz the ’87 British F3 championship. Many of us in the crowd felt sure he was a nailed-on future F1 world champion. Then it all went quiet. I’ve never felt so depressed leaving a race circuit. Life-changing Long before the internet, it was only the next day we learned he was still alive. “My life changed so dramatically,” he says. “When I was lying in hospital, I didn’t think so. Mentally, I felt the same. But the physical side had changed.” The two feet-on impacts, one with a concrete bridge parapet on the left, the other into a steel barrier on the right, disintegrated the front of his Reynard.  “The left foot nearly got taken off and the other one, it hammered my heel,” he says. “My heel is actually around the side where my ankle should be.” His recall of what powers he lost triggers a cold shiver.  “Back in those days, it was a stick shift, three pedals, heel-and-toe. It was all very easy, very natural before. I never even thought about it. I never looked at any distance boards, dark patches on the circuit or grass to visualise where I was going to brake or turn in. I just did it. It just happened. After the crash, that mental side was still there, but the physical side didn’t allow me to do it. I had to find ways of overcoming the problem. Sadly, now I had to have braking points, and braking points are not the fastest way, by a long shot.”  Yet barely eight months after that crash, Herbert somehow made his F1 debut, for Benetton at the Brazilian GP in Rio. Team chief Peter Collins kept his iron-clad faith that Herbert was the real deal, and no injury – even one that left him struggling to walk – would stop him.  “Just because the diamond has been scratched, it doesn’t mean it’s not a diamond,” said Collins, who later gave an eternally grateful Herbert another F1 lifeline at Lotus. In Rio in 1989, at a circuit that masked Herbert’s struggles with hard braking, he somehow finished fourth, just 10.5sec behind Nigel Mansell’s winning Ferrari.  It’s one of F1’s greatest debuts, especially in the context of what he was dealing with. But Flavio Briatore, who joined Benetton that year, never believed Herbert was fit enough to race.  After struggles at other tracks, he was dropped mid-season. His admiration for Briatore remains well under control all these years later, especially after the second spell at Benetton, when he claims the team treated him as second-rate compared with team-mate Schumacher.  The British GP win and another inherited at Monza are some consolation, but little more than that. “The other thing I struggled with was throttle modulation, because again I didn’t have the feel,” he says.  “Again, instead of through my toes, it was through my knee and my hip. It was never smooth enough, always a bit jerky and on and off, which disturbed the car. The only time I had it back to what I vaguely remember before was one race: Malaysia, 1999. That was the only one and I don’t know why. It frustrates the damn hell out of me, but it happened that weekend.”  By then, he’d just claimed his third and final GP win, after an intuitive wet-weather drive at the Nürburgring for Stewart GP. One more year  at the team rebranded as Jaguar in 2000 and F1 was done with Herbert – from a cockpit’s perspective, at least.  “All those little ingredients made it way more difficult,” he says, “but I can sit back in my chair now and say, considering the state of my feet, I gave it a good go. It wasn’t what I wanted or what I had before. But I still achieved a lot, considering I don’t have any ankle joints.”  He chuckles as he recalls sitting with his wife Becky at home, when she might stretch out her legs and wiggle her toes. “I say to her: ‘You’re doing that on purpose, aren’t you?!’ A very simple thing I can’t do.”  Glass half empty or half full? Herbert is inclined towards the latter, perhaps because the former might drive him insane. “No one today would touch me with a bargepole!” he says of his post-injury self.  “I found a way but it was never perfect. The three wins I got: they weren’t perfect. But I’m glad I was able to find the strength and not give up. There were frustrating times. I was never going to be a world champion, but I was there or thereabouts.  “Was that good enough for me? No. That’s not what my dream was. That’s not where I was in 1988. I was on such a high that I could beat anybody, anywhere, any track, any car. That left me after Brands Hatch, 1988. It never, ever came back.”",

But some jackets can play a handful of roles well, offering enough versatility to earn a spot in your gear closet. The Icon Slabtown is one such piece. Named after the district in Portland, Oregon, USA where Icon Motosports is based, the Slabtown jacket is pitched as a three-season street riding jacket. It’s not waterproof, nor is it designed for extremely hot days. But for anything from chilly to warm weather, it works a treat. Aesthetically, the Slabtown is all business, featuring a slightly subdued take on the urban brawler styling that Icon is famous for. It’s cut with Icon’s ‘sport’ fit, which means it’s boxy rather than tailored, with generous hook-and-loop waist adjusters and pre-curved sleeves.…",

    "description": "Photography by: Johnathan Rothman (@thejohnrothman) 1956 Jaguar XK140 Convertible Raced in period by Briggs Cunningham and Denise McLuggage Location: California, USA Country of original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: S818207 Mileage: 76,025 miles Colour: Red Original colour of delivery: Carmine Red Price: Call for Price The car As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer a unique collector-grade Jaguar. The Jaguar XK140 represented the epitome of front-mounted 6-cylinder Jaguars in the mid-1950s. This particular example is without a doubt the most storied one in the United States of America, as it was raced and campaigned by two of the most prolific personalities in the American racing world. The car was first campaigned by renowned Briss Cunningham, who was indisputably one of the most pivotal figures in postwar sports car racing, making a profound impact as a driver, team owner, and constructor. Briggs then proceeded to donate his XK140 to Denise McLuggage, an American auto racing driver, journalist, author and photographer. She pioneered gender equality in motorsports and journalism in the U.S., and was among the very first women taking part in professional automotive racing. Her racing achievements included winning the grand touring category at Sebring in a Ferrari 250 GT in 1961, and a class win in the Monte Carlo Rally in a Ford Falcon in 1964. She also participated in the Nürburgring 1000 km sports car race. This car's past is in fact so fascinating that it recently enabled it to earn a very coveted spot in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (MSHFA), where it resided in 2022 alongside other giants of the racing world. What's perhaps even more remarkable, is that the car presents in unaltered condition. It's been kept 'as-is' by its 4 owners (Briggs Cunningham, Denise McLuggage, and 2 other owners, including the present one), and is showing a splendid amount of patina. Everything about this car is original and has remained untouched over the last 58 years - the chassis, body panels, engine, transmission, suspension, wheels, seats, dashboard materials, and more, are all original. And, magically, 58 years later, it still elegantly runs and drives. Continue...",

    "description": "Someone wise recently told me: “A watch tells more than time.” Essentially, this means your watch is an extension of yourself, and different watches fit different people's personas. That saying is actually quite fitting for this bike – the gorgeous Royal Enfield Goan Classic 350. It isn't too different from the Classic 350, but it's targeted at a rather different rider – someone who wants to be unique but doesn't want the compromises that come with this style of bike. RE Goan Classic 350: Design, changes to Classic Design is one of the foremost ways the Goan Classic differs from the standard Classic. Starting at the front, you've got these very retro-looking whitewall tyres, which are found only on a microscopic amount of bikes available on sale today. While the tyres have a retro look, a welcome surprise is that the Goan Classic runs cross-spoke laced wheels, which permit tubeless tyres. The tyres are CEAT’s new Zoom Classic rubber, developed specifically for the Goan Classic. While the front wheel is a 19-incher, like the bike it is based on, the rear wheel is a 16-incher in proper bobber fashion. Then, the Goan Classic trades the Classic's handlebar for tall ape-hanger bars that put your arms almost straight and in line with your shoulders. It also has more forward-set pegs from the Meteor 350, and together, these changes put you in a properly relaxed riding position. The Goan Classic is also the only RE 350 to get the metal switch cubes from the larger 650s. Even the exhaust muffler is new and has a bit of a raspy note to it. You also have a cantilevered rider's seat, which is just 750mm off the ground, making it the second-lowest seat on any Royal Enfield today, after the Super Meteor 650. But my favourite design element is this articulated rear fender that moves with the wheel. The logos and badging on this bike also align with the retro custom aesthetic and add that little bit of extra pizzazz to its design. The Goan Classic’s colour palette is very funky and out there, and those who like to make a statement with their bikes will like the paint options. There are four colours to choose from, but my favourite has to be the Trip Teal (nice naming, RE!). RE Goan Classic 350: Ride and handling, comfort So, how do all these changes affect the riding experience? The short answer is, not much. The Goan Classic feels very similar to the Classic 350, which is a very pleasant feeling, with the only difference being how you're seated. The tall ape hangers work rather well when you're riding, and there's no strain on your arms or shoulders. After a brief accustomization period, I found my rhythm, and I suspect it will be the same for most others. The only small caveat here is that while making a tight U-turn, you need to plan your movements correctly and be a little more mindful of the tall bars. And because of how you're seated on the bike, you'll also bear the brunt of bad roads a little more than the Classic. That said, the Goan Classic is nowhere as uncomfortable as its competitors from Classic Legends. Honestly, aside from the different riding positions, the rest of the riding experience is pretty much identical to the Classic 350. This means it's the same relaxed, comfortable, and smooth yet torquey bike we've come to know and loved over the years. RE Goan Classic: Verdict All in all, the Goan Classic 350 feels like a cut above the rest of the 350s in terms of fit and finish, quality, and uniqueness. This will also be reflected in its price, as it is the most expensive 350cc Royal Enfield. Prices start at Rs 2.35 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) and go up to Rs 2.38 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), making it Rs 5,000 - Rs 8,000 more expensive than the top Emerald Chrome Classic 350. With the Goan Classic, you're getting a very unique-looking thing with proven fundamentals, a custom bike straight from RE. So, if you're one of the few people who use their watch not just to tell the time but to make a statement, I think the Goan Classic will be right up your alley.

    "description": "First things first. The Audi A6 e-tron Sportback you see here is not an all-electric replacement for the ICE A6 we’re all familiar with. In fact, the two models have little in common. You see, under Audi’s new naming system, electric vehicles will have even numbers in the name with ‘e-tron’ as a suffix (Q4 e-tron, Q6 e-tron, Q8 e-tron) while ICE models will run odd numbers. The next-gen A6 will become the ‘A7’, the A4 has already given way to a new ‘A5’, and so on. This A6 e-tron is the second Audi model after the Q6 e-tron to be built on the PPE or Premium Platform Electric co-developed with Porsche. Advancements in the motors, battery and architecture promise enhanced efficiency, faster charging and superior performance. The A6 e-tron has been unveiled in Avant or estate form – that’s sadly not headed here – and this Sportback body style coming to India in 2025. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback design The A6 e-tron looks substantial because it is. It’s about the same size as the A6 petrol we are familiar with, but there’s more mass to the design, something most noticeable at the sides. A black applique low down on the doors, there to also indicate the position of the battery, helps break the bulk. The fastback tail gives the A6 e-tron Sportback its eye-catching shape and to me, it looks best from the rear three-quarter angle. There’s a lovely flow from roof to high-deck boot and the full-width lighting is really slick. A glowing rear logo is a first for an Audi and the digital OLED tail-lamps almost have a language of their own – eight selectable patterns and the ability to display warning graphics to communicate hazards to vehicles behind. With split headlamps, a semi-concealed grille, and a black ‘mask’ on the bumper to hide the air dams and ADAS hardware, frontal styling is a dramatic departure from the Audi template. The LED DRLs positioned up top get eight selectable patterns and this is a cool touch. A fact of note is that the A6 e-tron Sportback is the most aerodynamic Audi ever, and this bodes well for range. But, and this is just me, I’m not a fan of this newfangled organic styling. I like my Audis angular. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback interior and features Inside, you’ll see the latest from Audi and that’s a good thing. The basic layout is similar to what we’ve seen on the Q6 e-tron, which means it’s a cutting-edge interior and also a screen-rich one. There’s a curved display that comprises 11.9-inch digital dials and a 14.5-inch centre touchscreen, aside from which is an optional 10.9-inch passenger screen. And that’s not all. Versions with Virtual Mirrors (camera pods that replace the wing mirrors) also add screens near the A-pillars. And lest I forget, there’s also a head-up display with augmented reality! The latest-gen digital dials are a huge upgrade from Audi’s Virtual Cockpit instruments we’ve seen for nearly a decade. It’s got crisp graphics, nice colours, and plenty of info, though what’s missed is the option to go in-depth into EV stats. I did find myself relying more on the head-up display while driving, though. There’s superb detail and the augmented reality indications for ADAS and navigation that overlay warnings and symbols onto the driving environment are fantastic. Interior is premium and trio of screens give it a techy look. The centre touchscreen is, again, slick and responsive but the menus can feel intimidating at first glance. Shortcuts and widgets do help personalise the screen for ease of use, but packing in climate control settings on the screen is not ideal. The passenger screen is a good way to keep your front passenger entertained while you’re doing the hard work of driving a very nice and very soothing electric car. What’s nice is that the screen is not visible from the driver’s point of view on the go. Along with the closely related Q6 e-tron, the A6 e-tron marks a return to form for Audi in terms of quality. Everything you see and touch feels really high-end. The gloss look to the screens looks rich and goes well with the piano black on the centre console. Also really nicely done are the touch-sensitive controls on the steering that are better executed than what we’ve seen on the latest lot of Mercedes cars. There’s a capacitive touch panel on the door, too, for the lights. Augmented reality overlay on HUD is brilliant. Front seat comfort is good, helped in part by the option for ventilation, heating and massage. A leather-free interior is optional and I have to say the fabric upholstery on the seats and dashboard is tastefully done. Of the other elements, there’s ambient lighting that subtly adds some colour to the cabin and flashes warnings such as for safe exits. The A6 is also available with the option of a full-glass roof that can go from transparent to opaque at the touch of a button. There’s also the option of an 830-watt Bang \u0026 Olufsen sound system. Four of the 20 speakers are integrated into the front headrest for a more personalised sound right near your ears. Soft-close doors are part of the package, too. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback rear seat and luggage capacity The rear seat experience isn’t quite as nice as the one up front. Kneeroom is decent but not exceptional for what is a large car with a long wheelbase, and headroom is just adequate for tall passengers. The backrest recline could be more relaxed, too, but the biggest spoiler is the knees-up seating position which is a recurring complaint on electric cars that position their battery pack under the floor. Oddly enough, Audi mitigated the problem on the e-tron GT with clever ‘foot garages’ or cutouts in the battery. The A6 e-tron uses a fully flat battery pack. Kneeroom is good but knees-up seating position is a spoiler. Luggage capacity seems a lot larger than the 502 litres mentioned on the spec page. And should the need arise, you can fold down the rear seats to free up up to 1,330 litres of room. There’s no provision for a spare tyre, at least in this European-spec model. The tailgate is powered, and handily, Audi has added a light guide for the gesture control so you know precisely where to ‘kick’ to activate the opening or closing function. There’s a small 27-litre frunk, and uniquely, it can also be opened with a swipe on the bonnet. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback battery, motor and range On to the heart of the matter. The Audi A6 e-tron Sportback uses a lithium-ion battery pack with a nickel-manganese-cobalt chemistry. Battery options include 83kWh and 100kWh capacities. The larger of the two is available with rear motor as well as dual-motor, all-wheel-drive layouts. The version most likely headed to India is the Audi A6 e-tron Sportback Performance that uses a 100kWh battery that powers a single rear permanent magnet synchronous motor. Power is rated at 367hp with up to 380hp on call with launch control. Peak torque is 565Nm. The headline number for this version, however, is range – 756 kilometres on the WLTP cycle. What’s more, the 800V architecture allows DC charging at up to 270kW, which means a 10-80 percent charge in just 21 minutes. We are still some time away before 270KW chargers become commonplace in India, so the standard 11kW AC charging and optional 22kW AC charging capabilities are of greater relevance. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback performance and handling A drive around the breathtakingly gorgeous island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands gave an indication of what to expect. The Performance version might be the long-range variant of the A6 e-tron, well, range, but it’s no slow coach. 0-100kph takes 5.4 seconds and the top speed is capped at 210kph. Of course, this being an EV, it’s fast, it’s responsive, and overtaking doesn’t require much thinking. But what’s different about the A6 is that it’s not one of those EVs that slams you back onto your seat. Its build of power is nice and gradual and the general feeling is of an easygoing and chilled-out car that wants to do luxury better than all other things. The general feeling is of an easy-going and chilled-out car that wants to do luxury well. You feel as much when toggling between the drive modes, too. There are Comfort, Efficiency, Dynamic and Balanced modes, and each impacts the throttle responses, steering and damping. Even in the sportiest of the driving modes, the A6 still feels very relaxed and gentle around the curves. Sure, there is nicer weight around the steering and the suspension does firm up, but if you want an agile sporty car, you should probably be looking at the RS e-tron GT in Audi’s line-up. Don’t get me wrong, because the A6 drives with confidence and is fun to drive when you’re in the mood. It’s just that it masks its speed eerily well. Refinement is spectacular and there’s only a bit of wind noise from the wing mirrors at speeds upwards of 100kph. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback ride comfort and braking Quick as the A6 is, it’s just as happy to slow down. The A6 e-tron packs in regen braking and you can control the levels of regen using the paddle shifters. There’s also a ‘B’ mode which brings in one-pedal driving. It feels very natural and was my go-to setting for the drive on the hills of Tenerife. The interesting thing is that Audi’s system marries the motor braking with the actual friction brakes, so they work together to give a stronger effect of regen braking. What’s really nice is that you can’t sense that handover from regen braking to friction braking or when they’re working together. The regen braking supplements the slippery shape, energy-dense battery and high-efficiency motor to deliver fantastic range. Refinement is spectacular and allows the A6 e-tron to mask high speeds eerily well. The A6 e-tron Sportback is really good on ride comfort, too. Steel springs are standard but higher-spec versions like our test car get air suspension. Unfortunately (or fortunately) there weren’t any India-spec potholes to test on our drive route in Tenerife. Even so, the 21-inch tyres dismissed any uneven surfaces with the air suspension doing a great job of keeping body movements in check. Ride height lowers by 20mm in efficiency mode for best aero but owners in India will probably use the lift mode more than any other suspension function. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback price and verdict The Audi A6 e-tron will follow the Q6 e-tron electric SUV and will likely launch in India in the second half of 2025. The A6 e-tron Sportback has an eye-catching shape and is high-tech inside, though it’s a vehicle to buy for the front seat experience rather than the one at the back. Refinement and range are highlights and even the middle-rung Performance version gets you all the power that you can really use. We expect prices to be in the region of Rs 1 crore, ex-showroom, which will be competitive for this size and class of electric car. The A6 e-tron Sportback represents the shape of things to come from Audi, and it sure does impress.

    "description": "Newly-elected FMSCI (Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India) President Arindam Ghosh has revealed plans to bring Cross Car racing to India, calling it “the future of motorsport” not just in the country, but globally. While the project is still in the early stages, Ghosh told Autocar India that “work is already underway, and the demo and test cars will be ready by January [2025]. But it has to be planned properly”. FMSCI sees potential in Cross Car races held in stadiums Small off-road buggies an affordable way to access motorsport What is cross car racing? Globally, Cross Car racing has been the first step in motorsport for several World Rally Championship and Rallycross racers. Essentially, Cross Car is to multi-surface racing what karting is to circuit racing. Usually held on autocross, dirt oval or rallycross tracks, these races feature small off-road buggies powered by motorcycle engines. Crucially, these buggies are easy to maintain and present an affordable way for people to access off-road motorsport. This makes it an ideal format for young racers to develop their skills. But this isn’t just limited to budding racers. Back in 2022, the FIA (the governing body for international motorsport) added Cross Car racing as part of its Motorsport Games roster. Currently there are three categories, headlined by the Senior category for drivers over 16 years of age and featuring 600cc-800cc rear-wheel drive cross cars. Next up is the Junior category for drivers aged 13-15, racing 690cc twin-cylinder two-wheel drive cars. And the latest addition is the Mini category for drivers aged eight to 12, racing identical FIA-supplied non-gearbox two-wheel drive mini cross cars. Focus on stadium sports For Ghosh, what makes Cross Car racing ideal for India is the fact that it can be held in stadiums, much like what we’ve seen recently with the Indian Supercross Racing League. This brings the racing to the people in cities, without all the complexities involved in setting up a circuits. Stadium stands also make it far easier for those in attendance to follow all the action. The FMSCI isn’t just focusing on Cross Car racing, though. Ghosh also stressed the need to set a proper training academy to “build our drivers first”. Tyre manufacturers remain key pillars of the motorsport community in India today and the two major national racing championships are currently run by JK Tyre and MRF Tyres. Ghosh has proposed unifying the two to attract larger crowds to races. “In our time at Sholavaram, we used to have at least 20,000-30,000 people coming to see on an open field. Now where is that?” he said. “JK Tyre has their own championship, MRF has their own championship. Somehow we have to try and bridge that gap and bring at least one championship or event where all of these unified series can run as per specifications and regulations.” Also see: Arindam Ghosh is new FMSCI president",

    "description": "Carmakers across the board have announced end-of-the-year discounts. Like the bevy of SUVs with massive benefits on offer, brands are also offering significant benefits on their range of hatchbacks, compact sedans and MPVs during the last moth of 2024. Here's how much you could save.  Disclaimer: Discounts vary from city to city and are subject to the availability of stock. Please check with your local dealer for exact figures. Maruti discounts in December 2024 Benefits of up to Rs 75,000 Maruti Suzuki continues to have the lion's share in the Indian hatchback market. The brand has half a dozen hatchbacks starting with the entry-level Alto K10, and going up to the Baleno at the higher end. The list of hatches on discount also includes the popular S-Presso, Wagon R, Celerio and the Swift. All these models have discounts to the tune of Rs 25,000 at the lower end, though the Baleno has nearly Rs 75,000 off at the moment. Even the latest-gen Swift, which was launched earlier this year, is available with discounts of around Rs 50,000. Other than the Swift, Ignis and Baleno, all of Maruti's hatchbacks are powered by a 67hp, 1.0-litre petrol engine with manual and automatic gearbox options. The larger hatchbacks get a 1.2-litre engine; the Swift has the new 82hp Z Series unit, while the select variants of the Wagon R, the Baleno and the Ignis continue with the older 90hp K Series one.  As far as sedans go, while Maruti launched the all-new Dzire just last month, unsold stock of the previous-gen compact sedan – with the older 90hp 1.2-litre petrol engine – is available with benefits in the range of Rs 20,000-50,000, depending on inventory. The Ciaz mid-size sedan is still chugging along, and is available with discounts of around Rs 50,000. Maruti's answer to the Honda City is powered by a 103hp, 1.5-litre petrol engine that gets manual and automatic gearbox options. The Eeco, which is Maruti’s entry level MPV, is also available with year-end benefits of around Rs 20,000. The utility van comes with an 81hp, 1.2-litre petrol engine and a manual gearbox opnly, though CNG variants are also on offer. There are no discounts on the Ertiga at most locations, however, the premium XL6, which shares its 103hp, 1.5-litre petrol engine with the Ciaz and Ertiga, gets benefits of around Rs 40,000. Renault discounts in December 2024 Benefits of up to Rs 85,000 Renault India entry-level product, the Kwid, takes on the likes of the Alto K10 and the S-Presso. Discounts ranging from Rs 45,000 to Rs 65,000 are available on the Kwid, which is available with a sole 68hp, 1.0-litre petrol engine. The Triber compact MPV, which gets a 72hp 1.0-litre petrol engine, is an affordable alternative to the Ertiga. It gets discounts and benefits to the tune of Rs 50,000 to Rs 85,000 at most locations.   Hyundai discounts in December 2024 Benefits of up to Rs 1 lakh Hyundai’s entry-level hatchback the Nios gets discounts of around 65,000 at most outlets. The Grand i10 Nios is powered by an 83hp, 1.2-litre petrol engine, and Hyundai has also recently introduced the dual-cylinder CNG version of the hatchback. The Aura compact sedan, which takes on the Dzire and the Amaze, gets discounts of around Rs 25,000 this month. The Tata Tigor rival shares its powertrain with the Nios. The Verna sedan, which comes with a 115hp, 1.5-litre petrol engine and a 160hp, 1.5-litre turbo-petrol engine, on the other hand gets higher benefits to the tune of Rs 75,000, or even close to Rs 1 lakh depending on inventory. Toyota discounts in December 2024 Benefits of up to Rs 1 lakh Toyota is offering discounts of around Rs 75,000 on the Glanza, which is essentially the badge-engineered version of the Maruti Baleno. While there are no major benefits on the Ertiga-based Rumion MPV or the Innova Hycross, Toyota's Innova Crysta has discounts of around Rs 1 lakh at some outlets. The Crysta comes with a sole 150hp, 2.4-litre diesel engine that is paired with a manual gearbox.  Honda discounts in December 2024 Benefits of up to Rs 1.2 lakh The outgoing Amaze is still available in decent numbers at most outlets. Discounts of up to Rs 1.2 lakh are being offered across the board on the entry-level Honda sedan, which comes with a 90hp, 1.2-litre petrol engine, paired to either a manual or CVT auto.  The popular City mid-size sedan gets total discounts and benefits worth Rs 1.14 lakh. The Hyundai Verna rival comes with a 121hp, 1.5-litre petrol engine that has CVT auto and manual gearbox options. The City e:HEV, which sports the 126hp petrol-hybrid powertrain, gets benefits of up to Rs 90,000 this month. Skoda-Volkswagen discounts in December 2024 Benefits of up to Rs 1.5 lakh The Volkswagen Group’s India 2.0 sedans, the VW Virtus and the Skoda Slavia, are available with attractive benefits of more than Rs 1.5 lakh for 115hp, 1.0-litre models, which get manual and automatic gearbox options. The more expensive 150hp, 1.5-litre variants on both sedans have discounts of around Rs 70,000 during December. Tata discounts in December 2024 Benefits of up to Rs 2 lakh Tata Motors' hatchback line-up starts with the Tiago, which has discounts of around Rs 85,000 for the MY2024 line-up. Unsold MY2023 models have discounts of almost Rs 2 lakh, depending on inventory at dealerships. The Tiago comes with a 1.2-litre engine that produces 86hp on petrol and 73.4hp on CNG. In either case, 5-speed manual and AMT options are on offer. The Altroz takes on the i20 and Baleno in our market and is available with discounts of around Rs 65,000 for MY2024 models. Similar to the Tiago, unsold MY2023 cars get huge benefits, going up to a whopping Rs 2 lakh. While the 1.2-litre engine is shared with the Tiago, it makes 2hp more on petrol, and a nearly identical 73.5hp on CNG. A dual-clutch auto is on offer with the petrol engine. The Altroz is the only premium hatchback that is currently ofered with a diesel engine – it's a 90hp, 1.5-litre unit that is paired with a manual gearbox as standard. The performance-focused Altroz Racer has a more powerful 120hp, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol mill that's shared with the Nexon compact SUV.     The Tigor compact sedan is the oldest model in the segment, which is one of the reasons why it is available with significant discounts. MY2023 variants get discounts over Rs 1.5 lakh, though MY2024 models get around the same benefits as the Tiago, with which the compact sedan shares its powertain.  Also see: New car launches, unveils in December Buying a used Hyundai i20 N Line: what to look out for Maruti Dzire ZXi trims get over 50 percent of total bookings",
