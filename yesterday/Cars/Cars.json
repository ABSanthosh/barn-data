    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/listen-dacia-ceo-previews-brands-next-steps-after-bigster",
    "description": "\"Affordable mobility is our job\" says Denis Le Vot as the firm embarks on its next chapter Dacia CEO Denis le Vot is the latest guest on the special Autocar Meets series on the My Week in Cars podcast feed. Speaking to Autocar editor Mark Tisshaw, le Vot outlines what he thinks is behind the brand's continued growth, the imminent launch of the new Dacia Bigster and its significance for the brand, why small cars need to have a future to ensure mobility remains affordable to all, and teases a new five-year model plan that will be announced later this year. Le Vot continued the chat off mic - the podcast was recorded in the back of a Bigster on a drive through central London on the eve of its UK launch - and he goes into further detail below. New model plans Dacia will reveal a new five-year plan later this year. Among the new models set to be confirmed are an electric Dacia Sandero (due 2027/2028), additional C-segment models to sit alongside the Bigster, and a new entry-level electric car to replace the Spring. Le Vot said the overarching theme of the plan will be a focus on Dacia coming back to \"affordable mobility or very affordable mobility\", plus electrification of the range. The Sandero electric car will have a technical and design freeze at the end of the year, and le Vot is happy to push this as long as possible to ensure the model is able to benefit from cost reductions and technology breakthroughs in electric car technology. \"We will come after the battle\" on costs, he said. \"The later you are, the better you choose.\" On the Spring replacement, le Vot said this would be engineered in China and use parts sourced from China, but be built in Europe, unlike the current model. It will be larger than the current Spring but won't cost much more, with a target price of €18,000. At the other end of the range, Dacia has no plans to offer a model larger than the Bigster but it would be joined by additional body styles in the C-segment. Rivals copying its approach Dacia is unique in its engineering approach in the industry, setting the cost of its components, cars and projects first and then creating them to that cost, rather than designing the car and components first and sourcing them after, which can lead to a lack of cost control. Dacia said it was able to carry on doing this as, unlike other car groups and companies, it did not need to leverage components and platforms across multiple models with different positioning and market positioning, which always ends up with unnecessary weight and components engineered into a car. \"We could take a Renault Australe and try and make it simpler to make a Dacia Bigster, but you would have all the spec still. We don't have an 'A' brand, and try and then make that car into a 'B' brand. \"If you look at the Jogger against its rivals, they are all 250kg heavier as they are carrying that higher spec. This has a cost.  \"We're not rooted by a minimum spec. We come from the bottom up, and add the minimum technology we need. Rivals come from the top down as they have to platform share.\" Bigster market research The Bigster breaks new ground for Dacia in going into the C-segment for the first time. As part of its development, Dacia researchers went to Germany to speak to 400 owners of German SUVs to find out what they considered to be 'essential' technology for a model in the family SUV segment. That's what has led to the likes of a powered tailgate, a powered driver's seat and dual-zone air conditioning being offered on a Dacia for the first time. \"We wanted to make sure that buyers here didn't feel like they had downgraded, to get the right level of essential kit. We really talked to people, and played a game of to buy or not to buy based on different kit. It was hard to guess! \"We did a bit in the UK too but the 'codes' between German and British buyers are very similar. The proportion of buyers from Germany versus France is much higher than with our other models.\" The Bigster has had the most successful pre-sales period in Dacia history and more than four in five had never had a Dacia before. More than 90% of buyers have gone for the top trim level, too. \"We need to make sure people 'cross the road' to come and check out Dacia. We have offered a €25,000 Bigster but most have bought a €30,000 one. They're happy and we're happy.\" Market positioning Dacia has more than doubled its sales over the last seven years from around 300,000 to almost 700,000 in 2024, and the brand enjoys strong loyalty with more than two thirds of buyers staying with the brand. The average tenure of a Dacia buyer is almost eight years, which on the sales numbers makes around one third of Dacia buyers each year being those who have bought from the brand before. The other two thirds are \"people who say cars have become too expensive\" and typically are from people coming from \"upstairs\" in the industry and other brands. Yet the brand has been evolving with a new look, logo and styling, and adding equipment as the market matures and evolves.  \"We were cheap before but the curve of what is essential is changing. Maybe we were below the curve before, now we've stuck more things on it. There is no arrogance in the product. We used to be low cost only but now we offer higher trims with all you need.\"",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/bmw-speedtop-revealed-striking-%C2%A3430000-shooting-brake",
    "description": "Shark-nose front end combines with raked roofline and ducktail rear to create low-slung GT M8 Competition-based concept is set for production as intentional contrast to mainstream BMWs BMW has morphed the M8 Competition into a two-seat shooting brake for a special limited-run concept called Speedtop. Unveiled at the Villa d’Este concours, the wagon has been given a complete design overhaul compared with the car on which it is based, and it is set to be built in a small batch “for collectors and enthusiasts”.  Each example is expected to cost as much as £430,000. The Speedtop is closely related to the Skytop that was unveiled at the same event last year. BMW is positioning the new concept as a modern interpretation of the traditional shooting brake – a format it has revisited several times over the years, with production cars such as the Z3 M Coupé and Z4 Coupé, as well as 2023’s Z4-based Touring Coupé concept. “The BMW Concept Speedtop forms an intentional counterpoint to our current [production] models,” said BMW Group design chief Adrian van Hooydonk. Production numbers, although not confirmed, are expected to match the Skytop’s 50-unit run. Prototypes of that car – which is already sold out – have been spotted testing at the Nürburgring in Germany. BMW has told Autocar that both it and the upcoming Speedtop will be engineered to the same standards as its regular production models.",

    "description": "Like its predecessor, the KTM 390 Adventure X undercuts its higher-spec counterpart and aims to deliver 90 percent of the experience at a much more affordable rate. For 2025, this motorcycle is all-new from the ground up, featuring more performance, better features and improved handling for just Rs 11,000 more than the outgoing model. The 390 Adventure X misses out on cruise control.   KTM 390 Adventure X design and quality (7/10) High resolution TFT adds to the appeal of this motorcycle What impressed me was the bright headlight that offers commendable illumination, and it might just be the best in class for now. I’m also happy to see that KTM has equipped this bike with the new TFT and ditched the monotone LCD from the older ‘X’ model. This new screen is vibrant and clear, giving the bike a premium feel. Switchgear quality is also solid, aside from the missing rocker switch for cruise control. The seating posture on the 390 Adventure is upright and commanding   KTM 390 Adventure X riding position and comfort (8/10) The X has the same ergonomics as the 390 Adventure, with a slightly lower seat height Apart from a slightly shorter seat height, the X is identical to the regular 390 Adventure. The posture is upright and commanding yet comfortable. However, the large windscreen isn’t adjustable, so you’re robbed of some of that sweet cooling airflow in this scorching heat at city speeds. Also, the seat remains quite firm, leading to saddle soreness after about an hour or two, which isn’t ideal for long-distance touring. While those shortcomings are worth noting, they’re far from being dealbreakers. The X corners surprsingly well and feels quite planted   KTM 390 Adventure X performance and refinement (8/10) In our tests, the 390 Adventure X managed a 0-100kph time of just 6.04s While this motorcycle packs the same motor as the standard 390 Adventure, it feels a lot more tame and approachable. This is because the X runs on what’s essentially the equivalent of Road Mode on the standard 390 Adventure. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it does make the bike feel rather mellow and un-KTM-like in its performance.  That said, performance is about the same as the standard 390 ADV, and this is the quickest bike in this segment. Despite the alloy wheels, the X can manage mild trails   Another surprise win? Less tyre noise. It was something I noticed on the standard bike, but here, it’s noticeably quieter. One letdown, though, is the quickshifter that requires a fair bit of force to engage and was mostly unusable on our test bike. That said, the X’s light clutch makes shifting manually easy and enjoyable. Moving on to braking, the X performs nearly on par with its counterpart despite missing out on sintered brake pads. Our braking tests showed nearly identical numbers between the two bikes, although the feel at the lever isn’t as good as the standard ADV. Seat height and weight are slightly down by 5mm and 1kg, respectively, which, while not massive, are both changes in the right direction. Unlike the 390 Adventure, the X uses organic brake pads that perform nearly on par   KTM 390 Adventure X ride comfort and handling (8/10) The X's non-adjustable suspension performs better than the higher spec adjustable suspension Despite running non-adjustable suspension and alloy wheels, the X still manages to feel pretty capable off-road. With the same 200mm/205mm wheel travel at both ends, it’ll do nearly all of what the full-spec 390 Adventure can, just with reduced confidence and feedback from the smaller front wheel. In fact, for on-road comfort, both Rishaad and I found ourselves preferring the non-adjustable setup on the X since it felt less fussy and a little more absorptive of poor road surfaces. Graphics and interface make the TFT feel upmarket.   KTM 390 Adventure X features and safety (8/10) Missing list of features aren't dealbreakers in any way The ‘X’ misses out on features like cruise control, riding modes, cornering ABS, adjustable brake and clutch levers, tubeless spoke wheels and an adjustable front fork. Cruise control was the only feature I truly missed and would’ve appreciated. Yes, it makes highway miles easier, but given the cost savings, I can live without it. The 390 Adventure X is considerably more affordable than the standard 390 Adventure.   KTM 390 Adventure X price and verdict (9/10) The ‘X’ costs Rs 77,000 less than the 390 Adventure Given the price difference, the 390 Adventure X makes a very strong case for itself. It delivers almost everything you’d want from the 390 Adventure platform at a pocket-friendly rate. For those skilled enough to push this platform to its limits, KTM still offers the fully specced 390 Adventure and even the Enduro R for hardcore off-road enthusiasts. But if you’re hunting for an affordable, lightweight ADV that punches well above its price tag, the 2025 KTM 390 Adventure X delivers. And if you’re not exactly ‘Ready to Race’, Royal Enfield’s Himalayan costs about the same and offers more all-around usability and comfort, although it feels much bigger and heavier.

    "description": "Two years ago, we pit the petrol-automatic versions of the Hyundai Exter and Tata Punch against each other. Then, the Exter had the upper hand thanks to its smoother and more refined powertrain. Today, we revisit this rivalry, but with a twist: both sub-compact SUVs are here in their CNG avatars. While they share several traits, like a dual-cylinder CNG setup, a claimed efficiency of 27km/kg and premium features, including a sunroof, this time, the spotlight is on their real-world efficiency. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG interior and ergonomics  Let’s begin with the Punch. It’s easy to understand why this Tata is among the country’s bestselling cars. The basics are done right – its high-riding stance, wide-opening doors and easy ingress make it especially friendly for elderly passengers. The high seating position offers a commanding view of the road, and the visible bonnet edges further help drivers feel in control. The driving experience is enhanced by light steering, gear shifts that are easy to execute (though not as precise as the Exter’s) and a clutch that doesn’t require much effort. Further, individual front armrests enhance long-distance driving comfort, and a surprisingly impressive audio system adds to its appeal. There’s a lot that the Hyundai Exter CNG and the Tata Punch CNG have in common. Switching over to the Hyundai, it’s clear why it continues to earn praise for its user-friendliness. Every control, from the gearbox to the steering, feels lighter and more polished – just right for urban use. While its seating position isn’t as high as the Punch’s, outward visibility remains excellent, thanks partly to its lower window line. The fit, finish and overall cabin quality are marginally better than the Tata, but the dark, monotone theme doesn’t feel as inviting, and the seats leave a bit to be desired. They feel a little too compact and don’t offer the same level of support as the Punch’s. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG engine and performance  The Punch’s engine performance has never been its strong point, and in its CNG avatar, it feels even more sluggish. While it can keep pace with urban traffic, it begins to struggle when asked for more. The Punch’s real strength lies in its composure at highway speeds; it feels stable and reassuring, which is something it does noticeably better than the Exter. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG specsTata Punch icng Accomplished + sHyundai Exter hy-cng duo SX TechL/W/H3827/1742/1615mm 3815/1710/1631mmWheelbase 2445mm 2450mmBoot capacity 210 litres NAEngine 3cyl, 1199cc Petrol + CNG 4cyl, 1197cc Petrol + CNGPower 73.5hp at 6000rpm 69hp at 6000rpmTorque 103Nm at 3250rpm 95.2Nm at 4000rpmKerb weight 1181kg 1093kg On the move, the Exter feels extremely refined. The 4-cylinder engine is quieter and more eager to rev, and its overall smoothness is hard to ignore. Thanks to shorter gearing and smart engine calibration, you rarely need to shift gears. It pulls cleanly from as low as 1,000rpm, making it ideal for stop-and-go traffic. In our acceleration tests, the Exter Hy-CNG Duo sprinted from 0 to 100kph in 14.85 seconds, a full 3 seconds quicker than the Punch iCNG. Moreover, the Exter is significantly quicker than the Tata when accelerating from 20 to 80kph in the third gear and 40 to 100kph in the fourth. The Exter’s shorter gearing improves drivability but hampers highway efficiency to an extent. On the highway, though, the Exter doesn’t feel as composed as the Punch. There is noticeably more vertical movement over undulations. Also, its engine spins 300rpm higher than the Punch’s, at 3,300rpm, while cruising at 100kph in the top gear. This also explains why its highway efficiency is slightly lower at 30.3km/kg in our test, while the Punch iCNG’s is 31km/kg. However, the Hyundai returned 22.8km/kg in the city because of its better drivability, much higher than Tata’s 20.7km/kg. Both cars delivered an impressive overall average, close to their claimed 27km/kg figure.

We first ran both cars until their CNG tanks were completely empty. After that, we refilled approximately 2 kg of gas in each vehicle and drove them around in real-world conditions within the city until they ran out of CNG. Then, we repeated the procedure and ran them on the highway. Since filling the exact same quantity of gas in each car is nearly impossible, we’ve calculated their efficiency based on the actual distance covered divided by the gas quantity. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG features and safety  For the record, the Tata Punch featured here is the Adventure + mid variant, whereas the Hyundai Exter is in its top-end SX trim. That said, to keep this comparison fair, we’re evaluating both cars based on their respective top-spec versions. Interestingly, Tata offers a broader spread of variants with the Punch iCNG. Its entry-level trims are more affordable than Hyundai’s CNG offerings, though its higher trims are pricier than the Exter. Punch iCNG gets a spare tyre, while the Exter only gets a tyre repair kit. When it comes to features, the Punch iCNG impresses with additions like cruise control and a large 10.25-inch touchscreen, which the Hyundai misses. But the Exter hits back with key safety features such as six airbags, a tyre-pressure monitoring system, hill-start assist and electrically folding mirrors, all of which are absent in the Punch.

That said, the Punch’s boot feels a bit more usable, especially if both cars’ parcel shelves are removed. Moreover, Tata provides a full-size spare tyre, while the Exter makes do with just a tyre repair kit. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG verdict  To sum things up, the Tata Punch iCNG is a compelling option for buyers looking for an economical, compact and practical highway cruiser. Its tough build, elevated seating and great audio system add plenty of appeal. Where it falls short is in outright performance and the absence of key safety features like hill-start assist, tyre-pressure monitoring and additional airbags. The Hyundai Exter, on the other hand, is the smoother, more refined and easier-to-drive option in the city. It delivers better fuel efficiency, offers more safety features, and still manages to undercut the Punch on price – despite packing in more equipment overall. It may not lead the sales charts just yet, but it’s the Exter that feels like the better-rounded product, and for that reason, it’s the winner in this comparison.

    "description": "Mini India has announced a new scheme to pass on the benefits of any reduction in the Cooper S’ price to customers. It is called the Price Protection Assurance and is only valid on the Mini Cooper S, which is produced at the brand’s plant in Oxford, United Kingdom, and imported as a CBU.  The price protection programme can be availed at any Mini India dealer Mini Cooper S ex-showroom price range is Rs Rs 44.90 lakh-55.90 lakh India-UK FTA could result in a price reduction; hence the scheme Mini Cooper S Price Protection Assurance programme explained Cooper S buyers will receive benefits of any price reduction until 180 days after purchase Under the programme, the Mini 3-Door Cooper S buyers will receive benefits of any price cut until 180 days after the purchase. The programme is only available for a limited period and can be availed at any authorised Mini India dealership. The Mini Cooper S’ starting price is Rs 44.90 lakh, and it is available with the Classic Pack (Rs 50.45 lakh), Favoured Pack (Rs 53.40 lakh) and JCW Pack (Rs 55.90 lakh).   Speaking about the scheme, Vikram Pawah, president and CEO of BMW Group India, said, “Mini has always stood for innovation and a bold character. With the price protection assurance programme for Mini 3-Door Cooper S, we are staying a step ahead and ensuring that customers are able to receive the full benefit of any major price reductions resulting from anticipated duty cuts. They can buy their favourite Mini today and do not have to wait longer to make the purchase decision.” Do note that Mini’s press release adds that the all-electric Mini Countryman is not covered under the offer as it is built at the BMW Group plant in Leipzig, Germany.  Mini Cooper S price could reduce in the coming days India-UK free trade agreement could benefit Cooper S buyers As we’ve reported, some UK-made models being imported to India could see a price reduction with the recently signed India-UK free trade agreement (FTA). As per the pact, India will reduce tariffs on “high-end cars” imported from the UK from 100 percent to just 10 percent. However, both governments still need to clarify several details, and that has led to buyers being unsure of making their purchase. British brands in India, like Mini and JLR, are seeing fewer enquiries as customers are waiting to see exactly what it means for them. The Mini Cooper S price protection programme should help ease some of those uncertainties.

    "description": "“Something really big is coming” and “It’s 3.9 meters long” were the only clues that Dirk Oehlerking of Kingston Custom gave us about his latest project. We knew that he had a Royal Enfield Shotgun 650 on the bench after winning last year’s Malle Mile Custom Build Challenge, and we’re well familiar with his work. So that was all the data we needed to fuel our speculation. Kingston Custom’s Royal Enfield Shotgun 650 has just broken cover, and it’s even wilder than we imagined. Best described as an art deco streamliner, it puts the German artisan’s talent on full display. Dirk runs the Kingston workshop out of a former forge in Gelsenkirchen, Germany—the perfect setting for the sort of hands-on metalwork that he relishes.…",

    "link": "https://www.bikeexif.com/yamaha-xsr900-retro-sportbike",
    "description": "The 90s sportbike revival is in full swing, and custom builders like Marc Bell are setting the pace. A full-time metal fabricator with an unwavering love for retro sportbikes, Marc has built some of the best late-80s and early-90s restomods we’ve seen under the HAXCH Moto banner. If it’s got perfectly proportioned bodywork, a lust-worthy livery, and buckets of retro charm, chances are it’s a HAXCH creation. Marc typically uses period-correct donors, but his latest project breaks the mold. This time, he’s taken a modern machine—a 2023 Yamaha XSR900—and turned it into a snarling, full-fairing homage to the golden age of sportbikes. Dubbed the HAXCH Moto Yamaha XZR900 Thunderbolt, this XSR isn’t a replica of any one classic Yamaha. Instead, it’s an amalgamation of elements from several of Marc’s favorite models, rolled into one.…",
