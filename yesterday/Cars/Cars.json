    "description": "This 1987 Porsche 911 Turbo coupe is a US-market example that was optioned with slantnose bodywork as part of Porsche’s Sonderwunsch (Special Wishes) program and was reportedly the first M505-equipped example delivered in the US. Used as a press car, it was displayed at multiple events in 1987 including the Indianapolis Toys for Grown Ups Expo, the 5th Annual Atlanta International Auto Show, and the Greater New York International Auto Show before being featured on the cover of the June 1987 issue of Automobile Magazine. It was purchased from Langeland Porsche of Indianapolis in August 1987, and it spent time in Connecticut, Florida, and California before being exported to Belgium in 2015 and to Malta in 2021. Finished in Diamond Blue Metallic over burgundy leather upholstery, the car is powered by a turbocharged 3.3-liter flat-six mated to a four-speed manual transaxle with a limited-slip differential. Equipment consists of a sunroof, a tea tray rear spoiler, power-adjustable front seats, air conditioning, and Alpine audio equipment. This 911 Turbo flachbau has 55k miles and is now offered with the owner’s manual, warranty booklet, and window sticker as well as service records, a Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, correspondence from Porsche Cars North America, a copy of Automobile Magazine, service records, and Malta registration.",

    "description": "If you're in the market for a super-saloon, should you be going Italian? You jammy sod. Those three words flashed up on my phone from a friend barely five minutes after I posted an image to Instagram. Out of context, this would perhaps seem weird. But the picture in question was of this sumptuous Etna Red Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio. My friend is a big Alfa Romeo fan – and he says it how it is. And I guess that some of you may have thoughts similar to my friend's. And you’re right because the £78,195 Giulia QV is quite the car: 513bhp and rear-wheel drive but with seating for five and a good-sized boot. I am conscious about coming across as smug in these reports, though, so I’ll be borrowing a bit of humility from my favourite American billionaire. I’m a big admirer of Warren Buffett. The 94-year-old is at the time of writing the world’s sixth-richest person and CEO of a huge multinational conglomerate called Berkshire Hathaway. He doesn’t seem the type of person you’d particularly like to go to dinner with – until you read his letters to his shareholders. He’s wonderfully dry, funny, and self-effacing. In the 1980s Buffett bought a private jet and named it ‘The Indefensible’ in a letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, who had essentially paid for it. I feel similar here: I promise to enjoy and drive the Alfa as if you were doing it yourself. Anyway, the reason we’re running one in the first place is that Alfa’s sports car-baiting saloon has had an update. It receives a 10bhp boost, a straightforward mechanical limited-slip diff (rather than an e-diff), matrix LED lights, a new grille mesh, and new digital dials. Ostensibly, I’m going to see if that has made a difference and how it fits in a marketplace that is moving so quickly. But I’m also going to answer a few questions. The first being: do the Italians do it better? At this stage, I have yet to put mega-miles on the car. But it is very different from the offerings from AMG, RS, and M. For a start, it is nothing short of beautifully set up for our broken Great British roads. I love the way you can set the driving mode to ‘angry’ with a twist of a dial, then immediately set the dampers to soft with a button on the same dial. Both ergonomically sensible and a satisfying thing to do. I can’t quite believe I’m writing this, but I also need to answer the question of ‘is the Giulia QV actually quite good value?’ News has just come through that the new Audi SQ5 will cost £75,000. The Audi is a bit more practical, of course, but its V6 is 150bhp down on the Alfa’s and it is a much less exciting and less exotic prospect. Then we have the expense of fairly mundane EVs, on which I won’t waste column inches here. The final and perhaps most intriguing subject of investigation is the engine. In my short time with the Alfa I have already fielded numerous questions from very knowledgeable industry people about the engine’s origins. Alfa’s engineers have described the all-aluminium unit as being ‘inspired’ by Ferrari’s 3.9-litre twin-turbo V8: both motors share a 90deg bank angle, cylinder bore and stroke measurements and a turbocharger supplier. There’s also Maserati’s Nettuno V6. I’ve experienced it a fair bit in our MC20 long-termer, and I think they feel and sound pretty different. But there’s no denying that both also share that 90deg bank angle and the same 8000rpm limit. Just how closely related are they? But that’s all food for future reports. How am I getting on with the Quad so far? Brilliantly, thank you. I’ll write more about the delightful way it drives later; in the meantime, I have been dealing with a few quite Italian quirks. That new digital display behind the steering wheel is configurable and can change depending on which driving mode you’re in. I like the option that’s modelled on classic Alfa dials: it is truly fantastic. Like a classic Alfa, but it’s all reliable, works consistently and can tell you important things, such as the fuel economy. Except there’s one enormous quirk. The ‘miles to empty gauge’ in the bottom left corner ticks down with a very satisfying animation. It’s great to watch but is almost useless: it theatrically tells you the miles to empty is changing, but of course cars have different ways of calculating this. It goes up as well as down; and it’s not like it diligently ticks down mile by mile, or every five miles. It seemingly spits out random numbers at will, with no rhyme or reason why or when. The infotainment is a bit naff, too. Yes, reader, I am a millennial. And, yes, I am complaining about the touchscreen in my 513bhp Italian super-saloon. The screen itself is fine – at 8.8in it’s a good deal smaller than the Germans’. But I really don’t care that much. The graphics are also a bit behind the Germans in terms of cleanliness, and the UX (user experience if you’re wondering) is behind the curve. Again, no biggie for me. But what has annoyed me so far is the lack of wireless Apple CarPlay. It’s a minor foible, but the whole plugging in, taking it out, making the wire and phone fit in the box situated in the armrest is a tad annoying. Maybe it will irritate me less over time. Update 2 Road test editor Matt Saunders wrote a brilliant piece about Polestar's head of chassis development, Joakim Rydholm, in which he made a point about not allowing national stereotypes to get in the way of fair judgement. Anyway, my Alfa Romeo has broken down a bit. With the benefit of hindsight, I think this tale begins in Wales. I had just crossed over the border when an unwanted bong nudged my attention. \"Check Airbag \" and \"SOS Call Error\" messages hung around like turds in a pool, but after around 10 minutes the warnings disappeared and I was left alone with my thoughts, the Alfa's V6 and the sheep. To be perfectly honest, when I got back to London, I forgot about the warning bongs and promptly went on holiday. I lent the car to my colleague Jack Warrick and he had the same issues. He then lent it to Classic \u0026 Sports Car's Aaron McKay, who had some real issues. He needed some wheels to get him to his grandad's 80th birthday bash over in Wales, and while it whisked him along the M4 fine, getting home wasn't so easy. On the Saturday, a burst of well-known warning lights and bongs alerted him to some mysterious malady. It was still upset on the Sunday morning when some unknown turmoil had managed to drain the battery and sound the alarm. Aaron couldn't get a response from jump leads on the boot-mounted battery. The local mechanic managed to find the positive terminal under the bonnet, but even he needed an extra battery to boost his Ford Transit to get the Alfa to turn over  Good news: the Alfa lived. Bad news: it was stuck in limp home mode, with only around 150bhp. Aaron battled through, and once the car was back into England, it cleared its error codes and allowed normal driving again. My theory? The Alfa hates Wales. Perhaps it's a huge rugby fan and wanted to hammer home the 24-21 win for Italy that resulted in Wales first Six Nations wooden spoon in 21 years. Perhaps it's just bad luck. Or perhaps you actually can let a touch of national stereotypes cloud your judgements on cars. Update 3  I bet you own, or have owned, a classic car. Or a weekend car. Or something along those lines. I certainly have. An NA MX-5. Eventually life got in the way and I got rid of it when in one year it accrued a measly 200 miles.   As I approach my mid-thirties, I seemingly have even less time to enjoy cars. But a few weeks ago something marvelous happened. Plans that had been in the diary for months disappeared. Whoosh. Just gone. A whole Saturday deleted with just a day’s notice.  In my mind’s to-do list there is a post-it note fluttering around, its adhesive quality slowly being lost over the two years since I moved into my flat and placed it there. It reads “find a good driving road near me”. And today, I am finally gripping that day-glow yellow square between my thumb and forefinger and putting it in the bin. Of my mind. But I couldn’t just get into the Etna Red Quad, thumb the big starter switch, twist the drive selector to Dynamic and press the soft suspension button that is nestled between said twister. No, I, like any Millenial, had to consult Google first. I point blank refuse to tackle any task, no matter how small, inconsequential or seemingly easy before Googling it. Eventually after wading through AI drivel, I stumbled across a very old post that mentioned some specific parts of Essex, close-ish to where I live, so I headed there. It was a crisp, clear, brown-hued Autumn day and the Alfa really felt alive once I got it out of the 30mph zones. When I got to some A and B roads, with the engine warmed up and exhaust valves open and growling, I really began to feel where the Quad is at its best. It’s all pretty mechanical and visceral too; not dissimilar from a classic if you can get the lane assist and stop-start bypassed in your mind. The Autumn leaves and mud elicited a few scrabbles for traction, a true hallmark of going for a drive in my eyes, and the Quad’s steering ebbed and flowed, tightened and loosened up so naturally I felt as comfortable ringing its neck as if I was driving something much less powerful and spiky. It would be remiss of me to not mention the state of the UK roads here. Turning right at a countryside T junction allowed me to test the Alfa’s quick steering. Two and a quarter turns between locks gives me enough manoeuvrability to pick a course, avoiding the worst of the massive holes I encountered. And at speed, the Alfa, with the soft spring button engaged, is masterful here, almost skipping over these defects. My colleague Matt Saunders, as ever, was correct when he wrote “On a good smooth surface the Giulia is fine in its firmest mode, while on broken surfaces it’s ideally planted in its softer mode.” In the UK of course,  a good smooth surface is increasingly hard to find.Fittingly, on the way home a chap in a Black Quad flashed his lights at me and waved, and I returned the favour. Like a classic car owner. But unlike with a classic, I don’t need to store the Alfa in a garage. I still haven’t quite found a brilliant driving route near me. Which means that post-it note remains flapping around in my mind, but I guess it also gives me another excuse to go out and find a great driving road. The addendum to this is that since this brilliant drive things have not been so rosy for the Alfa. The Monday after the cancelled Saturday I drove it into our Twickenham office so that I could lend it to my learned colleague Kris Culmer. Being in standstill traffic on the North Circular pre 0700 was pretty hard to stomach, but not much could bring my spirits down after the weekend I’d had. Until a message from Kris arrived that evening. The Alfa had broken down within 2 miles of the office. A parking brake fault, complete with a new error message. Oh Alfa. Final update  Right, then, strap in: we have a lot to get through here. I'll address the question of whether I'd have a QV over something more German shortly. First I just wanted to offer a brief chronology of the car's time at Autocar. It arrived. It was summer. The sun was shining and the V6 was singing. Life was good. Before long, deputy road test editor Richard Lane needed the car to be in Wales for a feature that also involved an Alpine A110 and a Maserati MC20 and I obliged happily. The drive west to Wales was magnificent - especially when I dipped off the motorway and onto the A5. The direct, tight steering and supple suspension made mincemeat of the topography. But almost as soon as I entered Wales, I got the first warning lights. Yes, plural. I got distracted by the scenery, and the next time I looked down the warning lights had gone. I drove home, without issue. Shortly after, I lent the Quadrifoglio to staff writer Jack Warrick for two weeks while I was on holiday. Jack became miffed with the fuel economy and handed the keys to colleague Aaron McKay, who works on Autocar's sibling publication Classic \u0026 Sports Car. During Aaron's time with the car, he drove it to Wales, where it again began misbehaving. They were the same issues I'd experienced. Except... Aaron returned to it one night to discover it had a completely flat battery. D'oh. But it was nothing an AA van couldn't fix. Aaron drove the car from Wales to London and deposited it on our carpark's naughty step. All the while, it transpired that the Alfa's plates had been cloned and some wrong un had been milling around Shoreditch, London, in a pre-facelift Giulia Quadrifoglio collecting parking fines and accruing congestion charge tickets. I returned from a relaxing trip away to find all these problems, but even if it eroded my holiday calm I couldn't be cross at the Alfa. Not least because the hard reset had got rid of the various warning lights. Fast forward a month or so and the Alfa had been acting impeccably, so I lent it to chief sub editor Kris Culmer. But it developed a handbrake fault immediately. That was just a week or so before but was due to go back to Alfa. But this is Alfa ownership. It was never going to be like having a Toyota Corolla. And I truly love it for that. The Quadrifoglio is a supremely special thing. We're in a bit of a last hurrah for the combustion engine and I just know that classic car magazines in 30 years will have special editions dedicated to this car, with pages specifically on the engine. The ride has a fluency that no other super-saloon matches, and after more than 2500 miles this was the thing that for me simply never wore off. A good chunk of those miles were completed on the motorway, and if you discount the mpg, it was extremely good at that. After every long journey, I couldn't help getting out, looking at the car's mean 19in alloys, low ride height and carbon fibre spoiler and just thinking: it should not be this comfortable; it shouldn't be this easy for a 191mph car to do what it just did. Sure, the fuel economy (23.5mpg test average) is hard to overlook. And truth be told, it was a bit of a pain for me. But frankly, the typical Giulia Quadrifoglio owner will be better off than I am, and a typical Alfa Romeo owner would realistically be willing to make allowances anyway. The Alfa isn't exactly the rational choice, when BMW M3s and Mercedes-AMG C63s are still brilliant while being a bit more reliable and cheaper to run. But I'll put it this way. How often do you see an M or AMG being driven poorly? Or see an M or AMG with ghastly modifications? Or see an M or AMG owner and just think: \"I wouldn't like to go round theirs for dinner because they will serve something unpalatable and have crap wine?\" Whereas with a Quadrifoglio owner, I just don't think those things. So then. The Quad. I had very high expectations and it was as brilliant, as thrilling and as perilous as I thought the experience might be. Only, slightly more comfortable and slightly more expensive.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/radical-renault-5-turbo-3e-get-public-debut-summer",
    "description": "Yellow, black and white livery clearly takes inspiration from the rally car driven by Jean Ragnotti Renault CEO confirms hyper-hatchback's debut is imminent and \"much more\" than 150 units will be built Renault will reveal its wild Turbo 3E hyper-hatchback in the coming months before starting production of \"much more\" than 150 units next year - and there could be more hardcore performance models in the firm's future. Developed in collaboration with Alpine, the outlandish 3E is the electric reincarnation of the original Renault 5 Turbo. It is loosely based on today's retro Renault 5 supermini but with bespoke bodywork, its own platform and a pair of in-wheel motors pumping out more than 500bhp.  It is far removed in its conception from any Renault model past or present, but CEO Fabrice Cambolive told Autocar that it \"was a kind of logical consequence when you look at the design of the R5, which already takes some elements from the old Turbo\". He also said it plays an important role as an expansion of the Renault 5 range: \"For me, it was very important to be able to have as extensive as possible coverage in terms of customer needs for R5 - beginning with a very interesting price bracket but opening the adoption of this car to people who want extreme sensations. \"When you have such a car which is such fun to drive, why not push the boundaries?\"  He hailed the 3E's ability to \"drift permanently\" and carry \"much more speed\" as headline attributes but said these \"extreme conditions\" were developed with a keen eye on efficiency, so as to ensure the hyper-hatch retained a usable range.  \"That's why the idea of having engines on wheels was very interesting for us,\" he said, referring to the 3E's in-wheel EV motors, a technology that is widely touted as bringing dramatic advantages in packaging, efficiency and power delivery compared with conventional 'e-axles'.  Renault will prove the potential of this technology when the 3E makes its dynamic debut, Cambolive said, without naming a date or venue. The original 3E concept was driven in anger for the first time at the 2023 Goodwood Festival of Speed, and sibling brand Alpine hosted the global debut of the R5-based A290 hot hatch there last year - but the company hasn't confirmed its attendance at the 2025 event.  He also wouldn't give specifics on the 3E's pricing but said \"we will have a fair price linked, of course, with the power of the car\" and it will be far below the £200,000-plus commanded by sibling brand Alpine's similarly extreme A110 R Ultime track car. However, Cambolive did say Renault will build \"much more\" than 150 units and has been encouraged by early reaction to the car.  \"A lot of people who know the price already are ready to invest because they think this kind of car will never lose value,\" he said, highlighting the collector status that has been achieved by the original Turbo. \"If you browse the R5 Turbo 1, you have prices that are quite significant…\" Original Turbos are vanishingly rare and prices for the best examples currently push well past £150,000.  \"I don't think the price will be a barrier,\" said Cambolive. \"As long as it's fair, as long as the car delivers the power, the efficiency, the technology, the innovation and a very high-quality dimension, I think we'll find our public – especially a public which remembers the ultra-sporty aspects of Renault in the past.\" The decision not to revive the dormant Renault Sport moniker used by previous Renault hot hatches is because \"we are focusing a lot on product\", Cambolive said, \"and speaking about Renault Sport without any products is not essential\".  He did suggest, however, that there could be more performance models in the pipeline for Renault after this. \"I prefer to speak about Turbo 3E, and after that to see what we can do on top of that if Turbo 3E is a success,\" he said. \"Let's build our 'sportivity' step by step.\" Renault product boss Bruno Vanel recently promised the 5 Turbo 3E will deliver an “outstanding driving sensation, something completely unexpected” that is “agile like nothing else” as a result of its innovative drivetrain. The two in-wheel motors enable more precise control of each wheel and the wheels can effectively “do what they want”, said Vanel. In-wheel technology – which, Autocar understands, has been supplied by British specialist Protean Electric – removes the need for an electronic differential or the type of simulated ‘manual’ gearshift used on the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N. The 0-62mph time will be less than 3.5sec, and Vanel described the performance as “breathtaking”.  The electric hot hatch will have a bespoke carbon-composite body. Renault has yet to confirm the car’s dimensions but its proportions are significantly different from those of the standard 5 on which it is loosely based. Only the windscreen angle is shared between the two. A longer dash-to-axle ratio in particular reveals that the production car will follow the concept in using a bespoke architecture. The two-seat concept used a tubular chassis with a roll-cage in the rear. Its extreme bodywork is created with aerodynamic efficiency and cooling in mind, including a vast rear spoiler and diffuser, flared wheel arches, and side air intakes to cool the motors. One of the key features of the concept version was its three drift modes for different levels of playfulness, including the ability to do doughnuts. The concept also used a manual handbrake and, given how important that is to the ethos of the project, it’s something Renault would want to retain for production. Sandeep Bhambra, Renault’s head of advanced design, said the brief from Renault Group CEO Luca de Meo was to “make me a little beast”. Bhambra said the “intention had always been to make it” for production after the positive reaction garnered by the concept that previewed it in 2022.",

    "description": "With sub-4-metre SUVs accounting for 60 percent of total passenger vehicle sales in India, every manufacturer is vying for a share of that market. Skoda is the latest to join the segment with the Kylaq, aiming to make a strong impact. The brand has generated significant buzz over the past year through its marketing tactics, including a naming contest and periodic teasers. We even had the chance to test a camouflaged pre-production model on a race track. However, the real highlight is its aggressive introductory price of Rs 7.89 lakh, announced ahead of the full range pricing. But the question remains: Can the Kylaq take on well-established rivals? Skoda Kylaq design Takes design cues from Skoda's latest EVs. The Kylaq incorporates Skoda’s latest design language, first seen in the company’s international EVs. It sports a split headlamp setup with sleek daytime running lamps integrated into the signature blacked-out Skoda grille. The higher placement of the grille and a flatter bonnet lend it a bold SUV-like stance, distinguishing it from the Kushaq. Rugged elements such as a matte black panel around the air dam and a silver faux skid plate further enhance its persona. The stylish 17-inch alloy wheels are well-proportioned, while faux roof rails add character to the otherwise minimalist side profile. The rear, though packed with design elements like a chiselled tailgate, black applique with ‘Skoda’ lettering and chunky plastic cladding, features tail-lamps that appear relatively small. The roof rails add character but are not meant to carry weight. Built on the MQB A0 IN platform, the Kylaq manages to remain under four metres without looking like a forced compromise. Despite a shorter wheelbase than the Kushaq (reduced by 85mm to 2,566mm), it is 23mm wider and 7mm taller. Impressively, it boasts the second-largest wheelbase in the segment and a ground clearance of 189mm, reinforcing its SUV credentials. Impressively, the Kylaq has been awarded a solid 5 stars by BNCAP in crash tests. Skoda Kylaq interior While the exterior differentiates itself, the interior closely resembles the Kushaq – offering a clean, uncluttered design and a solid build. The reassuring ‘thud’ of the doors remains intact, as do elements like the digital instrument cluster, two-spoke steering wheel, and climate control console. However, Skoda has introduced ‘olive green’ inserts on the dashboard, door panels and centre console, along with a light-textured fascia to add uniqueness. Octagonal surrounds on the air vents further distinguish it from its stablemates. Olive green inserts and new-design AC vents help differentiate the Kylaq’s interior from the Kushaq. A light grey theme brightens its cabin ambience, and even though the plastics are hard, these feel high-quality and long-lasting. However, the Kushaq’s cabin tends to develop creaks and squeaks, so we’ll have to wait and see whether the same happens in the Kylaq. The front seats are powered and ventilated and quite comfortable. With the wheelbase being shorter than the Kushaq’s, the rear legroom is understandably tighter. However, on the whole, it is par for the course. Some might find the backrest a tad too upright, and because of the cup-like seat contouring, this area is best for two adults only. Front seat comfort is a highlight of the Kylaq. The upright backrest angle enhances boot space, which Skoda advertises to be 446 litres up to the roof; the usable boot space is just 360 litres up to the rear parcel shelf only. Below the boot floor sits a spare tyre, but unlike its premium stable mates, there is no subwoofer placed here. Rear legroom is average by segment standards; contoured seatbacks make it best for just two. While on that topic, the top-spec Kylaq is equipped with auto LED headlamps, 17-inch alloys, a sunroof, powered and ventilated front seats, a wireless charger and a digital instrument cluster, to name a few. The touchscreen gets updated software, which includes a new coloured theme. Wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay continue to be offered, and while the speakers aren’t branded per se, the sound quality is respectable. Some rivals go a step further by offering rear disc brakes, ADAS, a 360-degree camera and a panoramic sunroof. Only the top-spec Kylaq Prestige variant gets the sunroof.   Skoda Kylaq performance The Kylaq is powered by a 999cc 3-cylinder turbo-petrol engine – the same as in the Kushaq and Slavia. In a smaller package, its performance feels livelier, though turbo lag is noticeable below 2,000rpm. Once past this point, power delivery is strong, and the engine revs quite freely, too. Our preliminary tests indicate a 0-100kph sprint in 11 seconds for the manual variant, while the automatic takes 11.9 seconds. Kushaq's 115hp engine feels livelier in the lighter Kylaq. The 6-speed manual gearbox is not the smoothest, requiring effort to slot gears and featuring a heavy clutch. The 6-speed automatic gearbox is likely to be the choice for a majority of urban dwellers, and the good news is that it is smooth for the most part and works well with this engine. The engine idling speed is still high to prevent it from stalling. However, it doesn’t leap forward from a standstill as aggressively as the Kushaq. Throttle responses feel a bit lazy, and to extract the best out of this engine, the automatic gets a ‘Sport’ mode for more zing. There are paddle shifters, as well as a Tiptronic mode for manual control over the transmission. But the downshifts aren’t very quick, and the transition from third to second or second to first gear can get jerky. Downshifts when using the paddle shifters aren’t all that quick. The Kylaq’s refinement leaves scope for improvement. The engine is prominently audible all throughout, and you will feel vibrations across the cabin, which indicates that insulation isn’t as generous as its premium siblings. Skoda Kylaq ride and handling The Kylaq’s stiff chassis and suspension setup make it feel nimble and engaging to drive. Despite its 189mm ground clearance, body roll is well controlled, and grip levels are excellent. The steering is light and precise – great for city driving, though driving enthusiasts may desire more feedback. However, the stiffness results in a rather unsettled ride quality, especially at city speeds, where it occasionally feels jarring. On the braking front, stopping power is strong and confidence-inspiring, even without rear disc brakes. Skoda Kylaq verdict The Kylaq is an engaging drive. While the Kylaq doesn’t break new ground in any particular area, it delivers where it matters – engaging driving dynamics, solid build quality and a well-equipped feature list. However, its refinement levels, rear seat comfort and ride quality leave room for improvement. The aggressive entry price is a strong hook, but the prices of its top variants are close to those of its better-equipped rivals. Despite this, the Kylaq’s nimble handling and Skoda’s reputation for safety and durability make it an appealing alternative for those seeking a fun-to-drive, compact SUV.   The Kylaq may be late to the party, but it has made a statement. In summary, the Kylaq delivers a Kushaq-like experience at a relatively more affordable price, and that makes it worthy of your consideration.

    "description": "Ease of use. Practicality. Comfort. Fuel efficiency. These are some of the main driving forces that drive a scooterist’s purchase. The all-new Jupiter 110 made a strong case for itself when we sampled it for the first time at TVS’ test track a few months ago. While it undoubtedly left us impressed, the pertinent question is: how does it tackle the chaotic, staccato grind of a bustling city like Mumbai? Since the Jupiter 110 now uses the same main frame as the 125, it inherits some of its bigger sibling’s inherent trump cards, like the 33-litre boot (the largest on any Indian ICE scooter) and the handy (pun intended) apron-mounted fuel filler. Apron-mounted fuel filler is very convenient, but fuel can splash back. Both of these are highly appreciable features for a scooter – something no rival can match. As for the design, this is easily the most youthful 110cc family scooter out there, and the vibrant matte blue colour helps things further. 33-litre boot is one of the biggest USPs of the TVS Jupiter models. TVS has also given the Jupiter a first-in-class feature, an ISG (Integrated Starter Generator) that enables a very small performance boost (0.6Nm, to be precise) that can be used for a few seconds, about two times every minute before the system needs to recharge. LCD dash shows you a lot, but the empty space around it is an eyesore. On this top Disc SmartXonnect variant, there’s also a new Bluetooth-compatible LCD display (available only on the top two variants) with turn-by-turn navigation and other standard-issue features, such as average FE, two trip meters, a clock, and the like. Bluetooth connectivity brings in call and navigation alerts. Our only gripe here is that this is a tightly packed vertical display housed inside a horizontal surround, leaving a lot of black plastic on the sides, which we think can be used to show more info.   That minor gripe fades into the background once you thumb the starter, and the Jupiter silently comes to life. To ride, we believe it is one of the most impressive all-rounders in the entire sub-150cc scooter game today. And we’ll explain why. The Jupiter is a relaxed commuting partner. The lane that leads to our office is notorious for its cavalcade of potholes, uneven patchwork, and gutter covers, all waiting to wreak havoc on your back as well as the vehicle’s suspension. Happily, the Jupiter dealt with this stretch without much fuss, thanks to its well-judged suspension setup and contoured seat, both of which kept us comfortable. Suspension is well-judged, winged preload adjuster is very convenient. 110cc scooters aren’t meant to be the last word in handling, but the Jupiter is reassuringly planted and nimble, attributes that lend nicely to its overarching role as a family’s urban runabout. At 106kg, the Jupiter’s weight is more than manageable for most riders, and it is one of the easiest scooters to prop up on the centre stand.   A sleeved-down version of the Jupiter 125’s motor is on duty here, and this 113cc mill is rated for 8hp and 9.8Nm (0.6Nm of that comes from the ISG). It is a surprisingly peppy motor and makes this the quickest 110 we’ve tested yet – only 0.8 seconds slower than the Jupiter 125 in the 0-80kph sprint. This is one of the easiest scooters to prop up on the centre stand. While the iGo assist is very subtle in its execution, it must be adding to the performance, and we’d like to ride a base Jupiter without the system back-to-back to see how much of a difference it really makes. Braking is reassuringly strong on this top variant with the front disc, and the CBS works well enough. The front disc is exclusive to the top variant and the bite is good. Despite the zippy performance, the Jupiter 110 is also pleasantly frugal, and we managed to get near-identical efficiency figures on both the highway (57.30kpl) and in the city (56.93kpl). Some of the credit goes to the start/stop system, which kills the engine after a few seconds of idling, thus saving fuel at long signals or in traffic jams. The iGo assist will probably be helping here, too. While this engine is both fuel-efficient and refined, it doesn’t quite match the smoothness of Japanese scooters – although our scooter has barely done 700km, and this may smoothen out after a service. The new engine is both peppy and frugal but could be a little smoother. What we didn’t like was TVS’ start/stop tech, which could be quicker on its feet, too. It requires you to hold either brake lever and twist the accelerator to bring the engine to life once you want to get going. However, if you twist the throttle wide open for a quick traffic light getaway, the engine sputters and dies, sometimes refusing to start without pressing the starter button. To combat this, you need to let go of the throttle once the motor is on for a brief moment, and then twist the accelerator. While it does help with fuel efficiency, some of us preferred keeping the system off.   The previous Jupiter 110 was already a sorted package and with this model, TVS has polished its bestseller further. With its combination of exceptional practicality, appealing style, great fuel efficiency and nifty tech, it’s hard not to see why this new one has already become a common sight on our roads. It is the most well-rounded package among 110cc scooters. While certain features could be more refined in their execution, the scooter itself is, without question, impressive. You could always buy the base variant if things like start-stop and a fancy display are not important. The one thing we’d like to see is the front disc brake being made available on the lower variants. However, given that no other 110cc rival offers this feature on a lower variant, it’s not something we can complain about too much. The issue is that the top model is quite pricey – even more so than purchasing a mid-spec Jupiter 125 with a front disc. However, until the Jupiter 125 gets a similar update, we can see plenty of people going for the top-spec 110 just for the way it looks.",

    "description": "It has been a few months since you last read a Himalayan report, and I must take some of the blame. Between a prolonged period of illness and some intense travel, the bike hasn’t received the attention it should have. On top of this, it ended up being with RE for a couple of months when I sent it in to address some issues, and I didn’t push for it to be returned sooner. TFT is easy to read and legible even under harsh sunlight. The first of those issues was that the usually fiddly toggle switch for the display stopped working entirely and had to be replaced. I also wanted the company to permanently address the problem with the bike pulling to the right when the handlebar was released – something I’ve written about in the previous report. As I understand it, the second issue had something to do with rectifying various torque settings on bolts that connect the engine to the frame. The bike returned with working switchgear and the right-leaning problem almost entirely sorted out – it’s still marginally noticeable but no longer to a troubling extent. Switching modes on the Himalayan can be a task, given how often it’s denied. As soon as the Himalayan was back, I realised why I enjoyed it so much in the first place. Its big size, incredible suspension, and fantastic overall comfort are a class apart. But since this bike deserved some good running after such a long downtime, I gave it to Gavin for his ride down to IBW, and what you’ll read from hereon is his account. Our Himalayan is equipped with the optional touring seat, which was a boon on my nearly 1,200km ride to Goa and back. It was firm yet supportive and kept saddle soreness at bay for the majority of my journey. Thanks to its abundant mounting points, strapping a tail bag on is a piece of cake. A little more wind protection would have been nice, though. The carrier and grab rail make for perfect mounting points for all your luggage. My issues with the Himalayan are mostly nothing new. Despite being replaced, the switchgear is sometimes unresponsive. While this motor performs well, the high-speed vibrations can render your palms numb on long rides. The one quality issue is that the right mirror keeps coming loose, and its threads have now been damaged, meaning a new one will have to be purchased. Finally, the headlight offers adequate illumination, but most owners are better off getting auxiliary lights. The right mirror keeps coming loose, and the threading is now damaged.   Despite these shortcomings, the Himalayan is an excellent motorcycle with a handful of minor gripes. While I was fortunate not to have any punctures, the fear of one always looms over me. Thankfully, we will soon be getting a set of tubeless wheels installed. Before we end, our bike has developed the typical Himalayan loose steering cone set, and that’s something we’ll address in the next report.

    "description": "Ducati has teased the new Panigale V4 via its social media accounts. The caption reads “Gen 7, enroute”, suggesting an imminent launch in India. New Panigale V4 gets redesigned fairing with reworked aero Loses the signature single-sided swingarm Ducati Panigale V4: what’s new for 2025? Powering the motorcycle is a 1,103cc Desmosedici Stradale V4 engine, which is now Euro5+ certified. Compared to the outgoing model, it delivers 216hp at 13,500rpm – just a 0.5hp increase but at 500rpm higher. The peak torque is down by 2.7Nm to 120.9Nm and is delivered 1,750rpm later than the outgoing model at 11,250rpm. Suspension duties are managed by Öhlins, featuring the smart EC 3.0 electronic units. Ducati claims it has refined the rear monoshock to shed 600 grams of weight. The bike rides on the new Pirelli Diablo Supercorsa V4 tyres; the sizes remain at 120/70-ZR17 and 200/60-ZR17. This supersport is the first motorcycle in the world to feature the new Brembo Hypure monobloc calipers. The earlier model used Stylema calipers for braking.  The Ducati Panigale V4 for 2025 has received substantial updates in the form of design and internal reworking, marking the biggest change since the model debuted in 2018. The headlights are sleeker, and the refreshed tail-light has two U-shaped LED strips. The aerodynamics have also been reworked. There’s a redesigned fairing, and the winglets have been repositioned while providing the same amount of downforce as before. After a long hiatus, Ducati has equipped the Panigale V4 with a conventional double-sided swingarm. The last Ducati flagship supersport to get this type of swingarm was the iconic 916. The new swingarm-rear wheel assembly is 2.7 kg lighter, and the bike now features 37 percent less lateral stiffness, improving overall handling. In typical Ducati fashion, its flagship is loaded with electronic rider aids. The 2025 Panigale V4 debuts a new feature called Race eCBS, which essentially manages the rear load without the need to tap the rear brake – all thanks to a system that monitors the bike’s lean angle, throttle position and intervening when required. Additionally, the bike has power modes, traction control, launch control, wheelie control, riding modes, a bi-directional quickshifter and ABS. Each of these electronic aids offers extensive customisation via a new 6.9-inch TFT display.  The Ducati Panigale V4’s chief rival is the BMW S 1000 RR, which was also recently updated and launched at the 2025 edition of the Bharat Mobility Global Expo. The outgoing Ducati Panigale V4 commands Rs 27.72 lakh for the base model and Rs 33.48 lakh for the up-spec S variant, but we expect an increase in prices.

    "description": "Alpina has taken the wraps off its most powerful model, the B8 GT based on the BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe. The B8 GT comes with an uprated version of the 4.4-litre V8 engine and will likely be Alpina’s last model as a standalone tuner as the company becomes a part of BMW as per a 2022 agreement. Alpina B8 GT gets 634hp and 850Nm of torque Its claimed 0-100kph time is 3.3 seconds Production will be limited to 99 units Powering the B8 GT is BMW’s 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 petrol engine that makes 634hp at 5,500-6,500rpm and 850Nm of peak torque at 3,500-5,000rpm. Interestingly, the output figure is 1hp less than the M5 CS, and the B8 GT is just 0.4 seconds slower to sprint from 0-100kph than BMW’s sporty four-door sedan. Alpina also claims a 0-200kph time of 10.5 seconds and a top speed of 330kph. The tuning brand has tweaked the ZF-sourced 8-speed automatic gearbox to handle the extra torque. Alpina says the B8 GT production is capped at 99 units, and only 20 will get a dual-tone paint scheme that combines a blue or green finish with a contrasting black. All units will sport a subtle carbon fibre body kit, including a more prominent rear diffuser, forged 21-inch alloy wheels, bespoke Pirelli P Zero tyres, special badges, a leather and wood interior and a metal insert in the cup holder bearing founder Burkard Bovensiepen’s signature.

    "link": "https://www.bikeexif.com/2025-indian-sport-chief-rt",
    "description": "When the Indian Sport Chief debuted two years ago, it showed that the American motorcycle company had its finger on the pulse of the performance cruiser custom scene. Dripping with Californian club-style details, it wore the sort of parts that riders of that ilk would add to their bikes anyway; tall risers, wide bars, a small fairing, and upgraded shocks. Now Indian is pushing that concept further with the Indian Sport Chief RT. New for 2025, the Sport Chief RT takes everything good about the Sport Chief, and cranks it up with just enough extra parts to make it a skosh more versatile. It’s a short list, with the changes mainly focused on adding storage and a passenger. While the ‘regular’ Sport Chief wears a solo seat, the new Sport Chief RT has pillion pegs and a generously padded two-up seat that looks like it was plucked straight from the Saddlemen catalog.…",

    "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJDrjdXmFeI Dave will be the first one to tell you his ’67 Shelby GT350 isn’t period correct. But when it comes to ticking the boxes of what truly matters, concours rules don’t even make the list. This car is more than a restoration; it’s the embodiment of perseverance, sacrifice, and a vision he held onto for decades. As a teenager, Dave watched the GT350 roll past his gas station, driven by a Vietnam veteran who had bought it brand new. To Dave, it wasn’t just a car; it was a rolling symbol of freedom and individuality. He knew, deep down, it would be his someday. That day came in 1973 when, after a few changes of ownership, he finally made the dream a reality. As it inevitably tends to do, life came by and happened. Marriage, family, and the responsibilities of adulthood meant the GT350 got pushed off to the back of his mind. Still, Dave never let go of the vision he had when he disassembled the car in 1976. Thirty years later, with his family’s support, he finally turned his attention back to the car, not to build a concours queen but to create something deeply personal.  “This car is not necessarily period correct.” Dave says, “It's not a concours car, but it's a hell of a machine because I built it the way I want it.” It took two years of bodywork, engine rebuilds, and assembly. He meticulously archived every bolt and part, documenting every detail as he blended authentic elements with personal touches to craft a machine that fulfills the longing he felt all those years ago watching it cruise by the station. Plenty of people want a factory-spec restoration, a polished time capsule built to live on manicured grass instead of asphalt. Instead Dave built something that embodies everything he values most: hard work, sacrifice, family, and the passion to see something through, no matter how long it takes. It’s not correct by concours standards, but it’s real by every measure that counts. For Dave, that’s all it ever needed to be. Continue...",

    "description": "The attraction to automobiles does not always pertain entirely to a physical quality. Sure, a car’s design, or its smell, or its sound can be part of that attraction, but a bigger part lies within something more abstract. If there was ever anyone who could relate to such an emotion, it would be Rob Simon. His steed of choice has been, and always will be, the legendary BMW E30 M3. In the automotive space, the legendary Bavarian warrior needs no introduction or backstory. It has long been heralded as one of the most exceptional machines ever sculpted by mankind, offering a pure driving experience unmarred by unnecessary aids or features. Despite a near-death experience in his red E30 M3, Rob always lusted for another one. It wasn’t just the behind-the-wheel time he longed for but the deeper, unspoken connection it wove between him, his father, and his brother, all of which had E30 M30s of their own. That chance would thankfully arise once more, but not in the way he would expect. Tune in to the Petrolicious YouTube channel and relive Rob Simon’s BMW E30 M3 tale alongside us. Maybe bring some tissues along for the ride, too. Continue...",
