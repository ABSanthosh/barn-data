Whether it’s because of a growing family or because of financial troubles, having to part with a car you’ve poured blood, sweat, and tears into is a heartbreaking moment. Daniel can relate to that feeling all too well. Back in the 1990s, when he was 13 years old, Daniel and his family would drive by a field in Reno every week where a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro Sport Coupe wearing many coats of aging paint sat next to a shed surrounded by weeds.

Sure, a car’s design, or its smell, or its sound can be part of that attraction, but a bigger part lies within something more abstract. If there was ever anyone who could relate to such an emotion, it would be Rob Simon. His steed of choice has been, and always will be, the legendary BMW E30 M3. In the automotive space, the legendary Bavarian warrior needs no introduction or backstory. It has long been heralded as one of the most exceptional machines ever sculpted by mankind, offering a pure driving experience unmarred by unnecessary aids or features. Despite a near-death experience in his red E30 M3, Rob always lusted for another one. It wasn’t just the behind-the-wheel time he longed for but the deeper, unspoken connection it wove between him, his father, and his brother, all of which had E30 M3s of their own. That chance would thankfully arise once more, but not in the way he would expect. Tune in to the Petrolicious YouTube channel or the embedded video up top and relive Rob Simon’s BMW E30 M3 tale alongside us. Maybe bring some tissues along for the ride, too. Continue...",

It was constructed and piloted by a German privateer named Helmut Fath, and spawned the next generation of sidecar racers known as ‘kneelers.’ A holy combination of old parts and new ideas, Helmut Fath’s BMW RS sidecar was pivotal to his rise to prominence in sidecar racing and his historic toppling of BMW’s championship reign Born in Ursenbach on May 24, 1929, Helmut Fath followed in his father’s footsteps with an immediate interest in motorcycles. A mechanical education at the Max Planck Institute and formative years working for BMW strengthened his fascination, and Fath found his way onto the race track in 1949.…",

The UK-based builder parted out an Aprilia RSV-R he was trying to sell for a turbocharged Suzuki Bandit 1200, and started a long, expensive journey. Despite its laughably lame name, the Bandit 1200 became a cult bike in the UK in a way that was never really replicated elsewhere.

    "description": "Few cars boast brand equity as strong as the Hyundai Creta. This formidable midsize SUV has long dominated its segment, thanks to its well-rounded packaging, feature-rich appeal and diverse powertrain options. Now, Hyundai has taken the winning Creta formula and electrified it, giving rise to the Creta Electric. The big question is if this battery-powered version can replicate the success of its internal combustion engine (ICE) counterpart. The Creta Electric is built on the ICE platform, but it has undergone significant reworking to accommodate its electric powertrain. The cabin floor sits slightly higher to make room for the battery pack, the suspension has been stiffened to handle the additional weight, and the front wheels are powered by an electric motor. Despite these changes, the Creta Electric retains the dimensions of its ICE sibling, including an impressive 200mm (unladen) ground clearance. An \"electric\" badge on the bootlid and pixelated accents on the bumper set this version apart from its ICE counterpart.   Hyundai Creta Electric exterior In terms of design, the Creta Electric takes inspiration from the Creta N Line, particularly at the front. The enclosed grille, featuring a pixelated theme reminiscent of the Ioniq 5, incorporates a centrally placed charging port. This pixelated motif extends to the closed front air dam, which includes active flaps to enhance aerodynamic efficiency. The 17-inch aero-style alloy wheels further emphasise its EV identity, and they come wrapped in lowrolling resistance, EV-specific tyres. Adding to its aesthetic appeal are silver highlights on the lower edges of the black plastic cladding, creating a striking contrast. Our dual-tone test unit featured black pillars, a black roof, and a black rear spoiler for added flair. Unique identifiers, such as an \"electric\" badge on the bootlid and pixelated accents on the rear bumper, set this version apart from its ICE counterpart. The sight of its battery pack beneath its body looks a bit ungainly, especially when viewed from the sides. Flaps on the front air dam automatically open and close to improve aerodynamic efficiency.   Hyundai Creta Electric interior Step into the Creta Electric’s cabin, and you’ll immediately notice its resemblance to the ICE version. However, several EV-specific upgrades make it distinct. A notable addition is the all-new three-spoke steering wheel with a circular horn boss, adorned with four dots symbolising the letter ‘H’ in Morse code. Interestingly, the steering buttons have been rearranged – the infotainment and phone controls are now on the right, while ADAS functions are on the left. New three-spoke steering wheel with a circular horn boss; four dots symbolise the letter ‘H’ in Morse code. The familiar 10.25-inch instrument cluster now features an additional cube-like theme, akin to the Ioniq 5. The air conditioning console – borrowed from the updated Alcazar – combines infotainment shortcuts with touch-sensitive keys, although practical physical toggles for temperature and a volume knob remain. A standout addition is the steering column-mounted drive selector, reminiscent of the Ioniq 5. This design frees up the centre console, which now adopts a floating style. It houses a drive mode button, an electric parking brake, an auto-hold button, ventilated front seat controls, and dual cupholders. Impressively, there’s a lower deck area beneath it which houses a fair bit of storage space. Even the armrest console is huge, and like the glovebox, it features a cooling vent to keep beverages cool. Lower deck area beneath the centre console houses a fair bit of storage space. In line with Hyundai’s sustainable focus, the seats are upholstered in eco-friendly materials derived from corn extracts and recycled plastic bottles. Surprisingly, the texture is smooth and closely resembles the leatherette used in the ICE model. The slightly higher floor impacts the driving position, which feels elevated even at its lowest setting. While rear seat space remains unchanged and is comfortable, the seating postureis slightly knees-up. A new boss-function allows rear passengers to electronically slide the front passenger seat forward, enhancing legroom. Utility trays on the front seatbacks include grooves for mobile devices and integrated pop-open cupholders for added convenience. You're seated in a slightly knees-up position, although it isn't uncomfortable. Additionally, the Creta Electric features a V2L (Vehicle-to-Load) system with a 3-pin power socket, enabling users to power devices like laptops or small appliances. Storage capacity remains practical with the unchanged 433-litre boot, complete with a spare tire under the boot floor. A 22-litre frunk provides extra loading space beneath the bonnet. 433-litre boot remains just as practical as the ICE version; gets a spare tyre beneath the floor, too.   Hyundai Creta Electric features Besides carrying forward the ICE version’s feature-set, the Electric gets some new equipment too, like rain-sensing wipers, electric front seats with driver’s seat memory, a cooling central console, boss seat function as well as front seatback-mounted utility trays. It carries forward the Autonomous Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) suite, which, like in the standard Creta, adds a safety net without feeling too intrusive in its function. Familiar 10.25-inch instrument cluster gets new cube-like display theme. Hyundai has invested heavily in developing an in-car payments option, which, with a mere touch, facilitates a wallet-based payment for vehicle charging, as well as future subscription-based features. In addition, the company has developed a first-of-its-kind mobile application through which users can not only identify and navigate to over 10,000 EV chargers across different brands but also make payments via the app to certain service providers. This eliminates the hassle of downloading and registering on multiple brand-specific applications. We’re still sore that like the standard Creta, it misses out on things like wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, adjustable front armrest, a headrest for the middle rear passenger, and the volume of its 8-speaker Bose setup is much lower at the rear than in the front. Also, compared to the large screens of its competitors, the Creta Electric’s 10.25-inch touchscreen comes across as a bit small. A new boss-function allows rear passengers to electronically slide the front passenger seat forward, enhancing legroom.   Hyundai Creta Electric performance The Creta Electric is offered with two battery options: a 42kWh pack and a 51.4kWh Long Range pack. Both utilise Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) cell chemistry, similar to the Ioniq 5. This type of battery is more compact and energy-dense than Lithium Ferrous Phosphate (LFP) batteries, although LFP batteries are known for their longer lifespan. For added peace of mind, Hyundai offers an 8-year/1,60,000km warranty on the battery, alongside the standard 3-year warranty on the car. The sight of its battery pack from the side looks a bit ungainly. Powering the Creta Electric is a single motor on the front axle that drives the front wheels. In the Long Range variant, this motor produces 171hp and 255Nm. Interestingly, its torque matches the diesel variant's 250Nm and is close to the turbo-petrol's 260Nm. However, being an EV, the power delivery is strong yet exceptionally linear. Acceleration feels brisk and effortless, even in its most efficient ‘Eco’ mode. The three drive modes – Eco, Normal and Sports – deliver noticeably different responses to part-throttle inputs, while flooring the accelerator unleashes the motor’s full potential. A synthesised bassy hum under hard acceleration adds a touch of drama to the otherwise silent drive. In our tests, the Creta Electric managed a 0-100kph time of 8.2 seconds, slightly behind the claimed 7.9 seconds. Flat out, it can achieve a top speed of 180kph. Acceleration feels brisk and effortless, but real-world range of over 400km impresses. The Creta gets a total of five regenerative braking options, with Level 1, 2 and 3 adjusting deceleration and bringing the car to a crawl.While these modes are mild, Levels 4 and 5 are strong. Drivers can also disable regenerative braking entirely for a free-rolling experience or opt for the ‘i-Pedal’ mode, which allows one-pedal driving by bringing the car to a complete stop without using the brake pedal. Each mode feels distinct and natural, making them intuitive to use. Adaptive cruise control integrates seamlessly with the regen system, adjusting braking automatically based on the situation, though drivers can override this using steering-mounted paddle shifters. Hyundai Creta Electric range and charging The 42kWh battery variant has an ARAI-certified range of 390km, while the 51.4kWh Long Range version offers 473km. In a mixed driving cycle of city and highway conditions, our preliminary test of the Long Range variant returned an impressive real-world range of approximately 426km. For reference, our 289.6km drive at an average speed of 41kph toggling through different drive and regenerative braking settings, utilised 68 percent of the charge. Charging port behind the enclosed front grille gets an LED indicator. Hyundai claims the battery can be charged from 10 to 80 percent in just 58 minutes using a 50kW DC fast charger. With a 11kW AC charger, the larger battery charges fully (10 to 100 percent) in 4 hours and 50 minutes, while the smaller battery completes this in 4 hours. Hyundai Creta Electric ride and handling To support the additional weight of the battery and motor, the Creta Electric’s suspension is stiffer than the ICE version’s. Remarkably, it doesn’t translate into a crashy or uncomfortable ride experience. Yes, you can feel its firmness at low speeds, and you’ll also hear its suspension ‘thwack’ over sharp bumps (particularly due to an otherwise silent cabin), but road shocks are still well in check. What’s nice is that the stiffness has eliminated unnecessary (secondary) body movements, and even at highway speeds, the Creta Electric doesn’t lose its poise. The steering, too, is noticeably heavier than the ICE version’s, and as a result, it warrants more effort at slow and parking speeds. But at no point does it feel excessive or cumbersome. And while it hasn’t resulted in more feel or feedback per se, the added weight only adds to the driver’s confidence, especially at high speeds or around a series of bends. Also nice is that the Creta Electric changes directions well, and with its weight being concentrated lower down, body roll seems to be far better controlled than the petrol-version. Notably, the Electric’s braking is so good, the transition from regenerative to frictional brakes feels extremely smooth and superbly calibrated, thus lending to a very natural brake pedal feel. Hyundai Creta Electric verdict The Creta Electric has its flaws – the ride is stiffer than the ICE version’s; the steering is a bit weighty; and finally, its floor is a bit raised, which results in a slightly knees-up position. But none of these are a dealbreaker. A standout addition is the steering column-mounted drive selector, akin to the Ioniq 5. The Electric version still retains the ICE’s brilliant packaging like its spacious cabin, ample practicality, and a decently sized boot – it gets a frontal loading area (frunk), too. Performance is smooth, linear and reasonably quick. But what’s even more impressive is its real-world range of over 400km, with reasonable charging times. And even though its suspension is firmer than the ICE Creta’s, it gets a newfound confidence in the ride and handling department. Typical to the Creta’s proposition, this electric iteration is feature-rich, too. At an expected price ranging between Rs 17 lakh and Rs 23 lakh, the Creta Electric comes across as a fantastic EV. Will it replicate the ICE's success? If first impressions are anything to go by, the Creta Electric seems to have what it takes to dominate the EV space.

    "description": "The Lotus Emira sports car has been launched in India, starting at Rs 3.22 crore (ex-showroom) for the base Turbo variant. The Emira is Lotus’ only ICE-powered model in India – a lightweight, mid-engine sports car that embodies what this storied British brand is best known for. It was launched alongside the new Emeya, an electric hyper-GT, which joins the Eletre electric SUV in Lotus’ line-up in India. Exclusive Motors, the official partner of Lotus Cars in India, has also inaugurated the flagship Lotus Centre at the World Trade Centre in New Delhi. The Emira gets V6 and inline 4-cylinder petrol engine options It comes in three variants: Turbo, Turbo SE and V6 It has no direct rivals in India Lotus Emira powertrain, specs Lotus is offering two engine options with the Emira in India. The first is a 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbocharged AMG unit, and the second is a Toyota-sourced supercharged 3.5-litre V6 engine. The former comes in two states of tune – 365hp/430Nm (Turbo) and 406hp/480Nm (Turbo SE) – while the latter produces 406hp and 420Nm of peak torque. Both versions of the Emira have their engines mounted transversely, powering the rear axle. The Toyota-sourced engine is available with both a 6-speed manual and an automatic gearbox, while the AMG four-pot is only available with an 8-speed DCT gearbox. At its lightest, the Emira weighs 1,405kg. In its quickest avatar (Turbo SE), the sports car boasts a claimed 0-100kph sprint time of 4 seconds and a top speed of 290kph. The Turbo SE also comes exclusively with a launch control function. Lotus Emira design, colours The Lotus Emira clearly looks like a baby Evija and has beautiful sports car proportions. The front end is specifically where it draws heavy design influence from the Evija, thanks to the design of the headlamps and the beautiful scoops on the bonnet. The prominent intakes on the sides, short overhangs and bulky haunches are some other defining characteristics. At the rear, the flat C-shaped LED light clusters are linked by an LED brake light, which sits well above the rear vents and the dual exhaust. Lotus is offering customisation options with the wheel finishes and exterior branding. The Emira Turbo and V6 come standard in Vivid Red, while the Turbo SE is available in Zinc Grey. The 20-inch Satin Grey wheels are exclusive to the Turbo SE variant. Lotus Emira interior and features Inside, the highlight is a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard. There’s also a 12.3-inch digital driver’s information display. It also gets most other modern convenience features, such as a multifunction steering wheel, a 10-channel premium sound system from KEF, optional 12-way-adjustable sports seats, cruise control, and ADAS features. The perceived quality of materials, as well as the fit and finish, is also quite remarkable. It’s a fuss-free environment that gives the driver easy access to all information and controls. Crucially, in a sports car, there are physical controls for the climate control and drive mode functions. It also fares well in terms of storage with cupholders, door pockets, a storage box between the seats, usable open space under the centre console, and storage behind the front seats for a couple of soft bags. Customers will get customisation options for interior colours and branding. The Emira is really a last-of-its-kind model from Lotus, as all future models will be electrified in some way, if not fully electric. With a starting price of Rs 3.22 crore (ex-showroom), it is certainly expensive for what is only an entry-level sports car. However, it does not have any direct rivals in India, with the Porsche 718 Cayman now gone. We have already exclusively driven the Emira in India, which you can read about here.

    "description": "Tata Motors, India’s largest electric carmaker, plans to double down on its EV portfolio expansion amid growing competition, and the strategy could entail an investment of over USD 1 billion. Our sister publication, Autocar Professional, has learnt that the company plans to launch its high-end brand, Avinya, in 2026, positioning it above its existing mainstream portfolio. Under the Avinya brand, the homegrown automaker will introduce multiple models developed on JLR’s EMA architecture. Tata Avinya brand likely to have five models codenamed P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5 The first Avinya model to launch in 2026 with a price tag of over Rs 35 lakh Tata Avinya P4 SUV may debut at Bharat Mobility Global Expo 2025 Tata Avinya EVs launch timeline and details According to sources familiar with the matter, Tata Motors is currently discussing five products, internally referred to as P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5. The P1 will be the first Avinya model. Based on the Avinya concept showcased in April 2022, this EV is in the final stages of development and will be in showrooms by 2026. The company expects a volume potential of about 24,000 units per annum. Sources suggest that the P1 is likely to be priced above Rs 35 lakh, making it the most expensive Tata Motors vehicle, at least until more premium models arrive. The Avinya concept showcased in 2022 previews the P1 model coming in 2026. Speaking of more models, the P2 and P3 have yet to clear the business case. So far, we only know that Tata has envisioned the former as a 4.4-metre SUV, similar to the Kia EV3, and the P3 as a 4.9-metre utility vehicle, like the Volvo EM90 MPV. Compared to P2 and P3, the company has made more progress on the P4 and P5 models. The P4 is a lifestyle SUV similar in size to the Range Rover Sport or Velar, and the P5 resembles a full-size Range Rover with three rows of seats. Tata Motors may premiere the P4 at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo in New Delhi. The company’s strategy involves leveraging the EMA architecture and targeting a combined volume potential of around 1 lakh units per annum once the entire portfolio is launched by the decade’s end. Tata Avinya production, investment and rivals The P1 will be produced at Tata's Sanand plant. The first model from the Avinya range, the P1, will be manufactured at the company’s Sanand facility, which it had acquired from Ford India. Subsequent models may be produced at Tata Motors’ proposed facility in Tamil Nadu. However, sources say decisions on models beyond the P1 have not been finalised. Various executives, from the chief financial officer PB Balaji to Tata Passenger Electric Mobility’s chief commercial officer Vivek Srivatsa, have stated that Avinya is a family of products and not just a single offering. While the go-to-market strategy for the Avinya brand is still being developed, given the expected low volumes, the company is likely to use its existing dealers to sell these vehicles. An email to Tata Motors seeking comments did not elicit a response. Tata Motors has announced plans to invest USD 2 billion in its EV business over the coming decade, with at least 10 EVs expected to launch by 2026. The company will launch the Harrier EV and Sierra EV this year to strengthen its presence in the premium segment. However, competition remains fierce. Tata Motors’ domestic rival, Mahindra, has created a flutter in the market with its high-tech BE 6 and XEV 9e SUVs built on the born-electric INGLO platform. With competitors introducing new models, Tata Motors’ EV market share has recently dipped below 50 percent. Moreover, the company will face stiff competition from Maruti Suzuki at the entry level as the Japanese-Indian automaker plans to introduce hatchback EVs in the coming years. Automakers such as Hyundai, Mahindra, Kia, Toyota and JSW MG Motor are also eyeing the mid-size SUV market. Tata Motors has played a leading role in transforming the Indian passenger vehicle EV market. While experts predict EVs will account for 20 percent of the overall passenger vehicle market by the decade’s end, Tata Motors has declared that over 30 percent of its total sales will come from EVs by 2030-31. Currently, 12-15 percent of its total sales come from EVs.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/mps-find-state-englands-local-roads-national-embarrassment",
    "description": "Local roads comprise 98% of England's total network, and many are in a terrible state Department for Transport is failing to take the problem 'sufficiently seriously', according to new report by MPs The Department for Transport (DfT) is failing in its responsibility to care for local roads such that their condition is now a “national embarrassment”. That's according to a damning new report published by the House of Commons’ Public Accounts Committee – the group of MPs responsible for overseeing the value for money and services provided by government programmes. Its inquiry found that “the state of England’s local roads is declining” yet “the DfT neither knows exactly how authorities spend its funding, as it is not ring-fenced, nor what it wants to achieve with it”.  Among the issues identified in the report are a failure to take policy and the use of taxpayer funds “sufficiently seriously” when looking at the 183,000 miles of local roads across England – 98% of the total network. It added that the DfT has insufficient knowledge of the condition of the local road network and that its approach to funding their maintenance is too focused on short-term repairs. The report comes after the National Audi Office (NAO) last year reported that the government “does not know” whether £1.6 billion of taxpayer money is actually making a difference to the state of English roads. The NAO said the DfT does not have a good enough understanding of the condition of local roads, nor does it allocate funding to local authorities “as effectively as possible”. The Public Accounts Committee's chairman and Conservative MP for the North Cotswolds, Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, said: “The declining state of England’s local roads is a national embarrassment. “As well as harming the prospects for our economy and communities’ own social wellbeing, highways riddled with potholes pose an increasing safety threat to road users.  “Alarmingly, however, not only is the state of our local roads on the downslope, [but also] our inquiry shows government are having to find out about these issues from industry bodies and road users themselves, due to their own patchy data.” In turn, the Committee has made nine key recommendations. On the failure to take the condition of local roads seriously, it said the DfT should “clearly set out its roles and responsibilities”, because it \"has not taken enough responsibility, given the declining conditions of local roads across England”.  On the DfT’s insufficient knowledge of the condition of roads, it suggested the DfT should work with the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government to better its odds of achieving a reliable dataset. The DfT said it doesn't ask local authorities for information such as the condition of walkways and cycle paths so as not to create a “large burden of work”. However, the Committee was “unconvinced” by whether doing so would actually create further work, as local authorities may already have such data. It added that the DfT should revise funding to ensure it more accurately reflects the wear and tear of routes according to their usage, as well as make clearer where the funding is derived from. The other recommendations include revising the DfT’s recommended practices for local authorities in consideration of future developments, such as the introduction of heavier electric lorries and autonomous vehicles; and reviewing how funding is spent. Edmund King, president of The AA, commented: “The poor state of our roads is the number-one transport concern for 96% of drivers. This report reinforces many things The AA has been calling for.  “We have highlighted the need for longer-term, ring-fenced investment using innovation and technology to permanently repair local roads rather than the short-term patchwork approach. “The Committee is right to highlight the inconsistency of councils inspecting and repairing the highway. Whilst funding shouldn’t just be based on length of roads, equally we need to ensure that extra funding isn’t just given to failing highway authorities who continue to get it wrong.”",

    "description": "Swedish firm targets significant sales growth with expanded line-up led by crucial new electric SUV The new Polestar 7 will be a Range Rover Evoque-sized premium SUV and the firm’s first model produced in Europe. The Swedish firm has confirmed early details of the new EV as part of a revised strategy, which includes a target to grow sales by 30-35% in the coming three years. The forthcoming 7, previously announced as due in 2027, will essentially serve as a successor to the Polestar 2 liftback, although it won't be a direct replacement, with this announcement hinting it will take more of an overtly SUV-like form. Polestar boss Michael Lohscheller said that the model would sit in the \"biggest and fastest growing\" market segment for electric cars, making it a key model in the firm's new growth strategy. Its new head of design, Philipp Römers, said: “Polestar is known for its progressive design, with each car standing out and creating its own buzz. So too will [the] Polestar 7.” He added that the new model will be “everything our customers expect from us, both in terms of design and performance”. Römers said that \"every Polestar has a USP\" and said that the 7 would have its own strong unique element but declined to give any details. Polestar has yet to give details on where in Europe the 7 will be produced, but it's known to have been looking at an under-construction Geely plant in Slovakia. Polestar's profitability target Former Opel boss Lohscheller was recently named as Polestar's new CEO after Thomas Ingenlath resigned last August after seven years in charge of the Geely-owned brand. He has now revealed an updated business strategy that involves \"significant changes\" to improve the firm's operations and financial performance. Lochscheller said that 2024 had been a transition year for the brand, but he argued that it had strong foundations with \"the right cars\" in its model line-up, and the focus now was on trying to improve on sales and distribution and also cost-reduction. The new 3 and 4 EVs accounted for more than half of Polestar's orders in the final quarter of last year, and the firm's line-up will continue to expand with the launch of the Porsche Taycan-rivalling 5 GT due this year. Lochscheller described the UK-developed 5 as an \"amazing sports car\". It will be followed at some stage by the 6, a limited-run 2+2 roadster. Polestar said that plus the arrival of the 7 will help achieve its ambitious plans to boost sales volume by around a third. Former boss Ingenlath said the 7 was due to arrive in 2027, but Lochscheller gave no details on its intended launch date during his presentation. Polestar is also aiming to have a positive free cash flow by 2027. Notably, Polestar will eventually move all of its models onto a single vehicle architecture, which it says will reduce \"complexity, costs and investments\". It's unclear whether Polestar will develop a bespoke new platform or use existing platforms. The 2 uses Geely and Volvo's CMA platform (also used by the Volvo EX40), the 3 shares the SPA2 platform with the Volvo EX90 and the 4 uses a version of Geely's SEA architecture. The 5 and 6 are also tipped to use variants of the highly flexible SEA, suggesting it's the most likely candidate to be the focus of Polestar's future line-up. Lohscheller said: \"We are building on the strong Polestar brand with design and performance at its core – but significant changes are needed to make this well-respected progressive brand a successful and viable business.\" The firm is also speeding up its retail expansion, with the goal to increase its number of showrooms ('Spaces') by 75% by the end of next year, expanding to 130 locations in Europe and 57 in North America. Lochscheller said that Polestar's emphasis will also shift from a 'storytelling' to help customers learn about the brand to active selling. Polestar is also set to start selling cars in France, where its launch was delayed by a dispute with Citroën over its logo design. Adding a European manufacturing presence will also help Polestar to expand the base of its 'asset-light' business model. Originally it made cars exclusively in China, but the 3 is now built alongside the Volvo EX90 in the US and the firm has a production presence in South Korea.  Polestar is also aiming to capitalise on its EV-only line-up by selling CO2 credits to other manufacturers that are striuggling to hit their European Union emissions targets – a tactic that has proven highly profitable for EV-only firms such as Tesla. Lochscheller said that he anticipated that to be worth \"triple digit millions\" in revenue.",
