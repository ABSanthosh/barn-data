    "description": "Any petrolhead visiting LA simply can’t miss the Petersen Museum, discovers Jack Harrison \"Are you going to the Petersen Museum?” was invariably the reply when I told people I was going to Los Angeles for the first time. I’d actually been sent over for a different job entirely, but clearly I needed to make the time. You don’t even need to get inside to realise it’s something special, as the flowing ribbons of steel that make up the spectacular façade beckon you inside. Named after its founder, Robert E Petersen, a publishing magnate and serial car collector, this museum was set up in 1994 in an old department store, then heavily renovated in 2015. There are 11 major exhibitions on at the time of my visit, and the top floor, where the tour starts, hosts just three of them, so who knows how much time I will end up spending in here… What’s immediately apparent is how well laid-out everything is. Unlike in most car museums, the exhibits are really given space to breathe, letting you wander around and take them in from all angles. The information boards are beautifully written too, striking a fine balance between informing and entertaining in a way museums rarely manage. I work my way down the floors, starting with the history of the tyre – far less dull than it sounds – before taking in the iconic movie cars, gawping at the terrifyingly expensive classics in the aptly named Splendor and Speed exhibition, learning how the Waymo self-driving taxis that I’ve seen around the city work and losing my mind over a trio of very special V12-engined supercar concepts from the turn of the century. There’s even a fascinating gallery on low-riders and the culture surrounding them.  The bottom floor is known as The Vault. It’s a big underground car park filled with some of the most special cars in the world when they’re not on display upstairs. It costs a bit extra to enter, but you would end up kicking yourself if you missed it. As beautifully laid out as the main museum is, The Vault almost manages to feel even more special. It’s as though you’re taking a peek into the inner sanctum, with the claustrophobic concrete ceiling making everything feel even closer together than it is. A pair of Eagle IMSA GTP sports racers sit wing to wing, surrounded by Formula 1 machinery, while on the other side Saddam Hussein’s Mercedes-Benz 600 ‘Grosser’ nudges up to the De Tomaso Pantera that Elvis Presley shot in a rage about its unreliability. I spend what feels like five minutes but in reality is closer to an hour and a half wandering around this exceptionally special place, slack-jawed in amazement at the metal on show. It all rotates, too: exhibitions change often, with cars from the basement being placed on display upstairs and vice versa. If you ever get the chance to visit, you must. Few car museums on the planet have a collection this fantastic and fewer still display what they have this well. Our favourite exhibits V12 Concept trio One for the PlayStation generation, this. It’s easy to forget that each of the American ‘big three’ made a V12 hypercar concept in the late 1990s or early 2000s, and they’re still exceptionally cool. The Cadillac Cien could only look more like a fighter jet if it had wings, the Chrysler ME 412 wouldn’t look out of place if launched today and the Ford GT90 is simply so bonkers that you can’t help staring at it. Rolls-Royce Phantom Jonckheere Coupe Nothing can prepare you for how big the Jonckheere seems up close, at more than 5.5m long. This one-off Rolls from 1925 is possibly the most elegantly imposing car on the planet. The grille appears to be as high as a human, while the folds of the bodywork seem to have been shaped by the airflow itself. Fully restored after being found as a wrecked shell, it even features round doors. Impossibly cool. Chevrolet Biscayne XP-37 Part of General Motors’ Motorama series of concepts, the Biscayne was built in 1955 to flaunt Chevy’s new small-block V8. Achingly pretty and full of features that would later become common, such as a panoramic roof, it was condemned to scrap along with the other Motorama concepts in 1958, only to be saved by a scrapyard owner when the GM exec tasked with overseeing the job decided to head home early.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/awd-jeep-avenger-4xe-launched-uk-%C2%A330999",
    "description": "Rugged Avenger 4x4 combines a petrol engine with two electric motors for improved off-road ability The new Jeep Avenger 4xe, the model line’s new range-topper, has gone on sale in the UK priced from £30,999. At launch, the 4x4 is available in two trims: base Upland and a special The North Face Edition. The latter is priced at £34,999 and limited to 4806 examples. Over the standard car, it gets Summit Gold accents and “a nature-inspired colour pallet”. Deliveries will begin in March. Featuring an all-wheel-drive hybrid powertrain – it is not offered as an EV –  the 4xe will “go further, faster and better off road” than any rival and “establishes a new standard” in the class, says Jeep.  “We are proud to introduce a model that not only delivers on performance and sustainability but also sets a new standard for versatility and style,” said new Jeep Europe boss Eric Laforge. The Avenger was launched as an EV in mid-2023, with a cheaper pure-petrol variant introduced in the UK a few months later. Both are front-wheel-drive models, but Jeep had always planned to eventually offer an all-wheel-drive variant to build on the brand’s long history of off-road ability. A 4x4 version was first previewed at the 2022 Paris motor show. Former boss Antonio Filosa, now head of Stellantis North America, previously told Autocar: “Every time we think of a Jeep product, we think of a four-wheel-drive version. Jeep is by far the most capable brand in the world, and for us capability is all around off-road. So in each segment, any Jeep vehicle must have more capability than every rival.” The Avenger 4xe combines a 134bhp 1.2-litre turbocharged petrol engine driving through a six-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox with a pair of 28bhp electric motors (one on each axle). The 48V hybrid system is designed to offer significant traction and torque to boost its off-road performance. Jeep claims it can generate up to 1400lb ft at the rear wheels, a figure likely achieved by multiplying motor torque by the gear ratio. The all-wheel drive system helps to give the 4xe a 0-62mph time of 9.5sec and the top speed is 120mph. Jeep also claims a “minimal” increase in CO2 emissions over the existing Avenger hybrid offered in some markets, although the firm has yet to give an exact figure. The powertrain uses a ‘smart’ all-wheel drive system, so power is always sent to all four wheels below 19mph. Between 19mph and 56mph, the rear axle is powered only when required, and two-wheel-drive is always used at higher speeds to minimise fuel consumption. There is on-demand torque distribution in all-wheel drive mode, with a split of up to 50:50 front to rear. The Selec-Terrain drive mode function features Auto, Snow, Sand and Mud and Sport settings, which alter the power distribution and stability control for the various conditions. The powertrain features a 22:7:1 reducer on the rear axle to allow for that 1400lb ft of torque, and Jeep claims that gives the Avenger 4xe the ability to traverse slopes of up to 40% - and 20% even when there’s no grip at the front wheels. With a ride height of 210mm, the 4xe model sits 10mm higher than the regular Avenger, enabling the ability to ford up to 400mm of water. Another bespoke addition is multi-link rear suspension, which allows for greater articulation on the rear axle. Additionally, the Avenger 4xe offers 22deg approach, 21deg breakover and 35deg departure angles. As previewed by the 2022 concept, the Avenger 4xe features a number of design tweaks from the regular version. The foglights have been moved slightly higher to provide better visibility, and there are roof rails and a rear tow hook. The front and rear bumpers are now made from mould-in-colour material and feature an anti-scratch finish, and the front bumper shows more of the wheels and includes extra cladding. There is a new optional bonnet sticker designed to reduce reflections when driving in sunny weather. Mud and snow tyres are offered as standard, with optional All Terrain 3PMSF tyres also available. Both are mounted on black alloy wheels. Inside, the 4xe gains new seats made from an easily washable material, along with greater use of more durable materials to extend the cabin life.",

    "description": "The bike you see here is emissions-compliant, ABS-enabled, and saree guard-equipped, which means it can be registered for road use in our country. That’s a big deal because no Japanese manufacturer has yet attempted to sell one of its road-legal dual sport motorcycles in India, and for that reason alone, Kawasaki deserves your praise. But does it also deserve your money? And how much should you be willing to spend on this motorcycle?  Kawasaki KLX230 design, underpinnings, seat height What goes in the KLX’s favour is that it’s the real deal. This is a proper, purpose-built dual-sport motorcycle with a perimeter chassis, 21-inch/18-inch wheels, and exactly the sort of uncompromising ergonomics and bodywork you’d want to see. Long-travel suspension with 240mm/250mm of front/rear travel and 265mm of ground clearance are impressive numbers that make for a wonderful pairing with a low 139kg kerb weight. 880mm seat but slim form doesn’t make it feel so tall. With an authentic dirt bike form factor must come a tall seat, and the KLX’s stands at a towering 880mm. That’s a frightful number for a market that’s deeply sensitive to tall seats, but bear in mind that this bike is much slimmer than your regular motorcycle, which makes reaching the ground a little easier than the number suggests. Some of my colleagues, who were about 5’7” tall, found themselves on tip-toes but able to manage. Another side effect of the slim proportions is a tiny 7.6-litre fuel tank, but the KLX’s mellow engine should help stretch the fuel range decently far. The simple air-cooled, 2-valve, 233cc single-cylinder motor sends a humble 18.1hp and 18.3Nm to the rear wheel via a 6-speed gearbox. It’s not very powerful but has a proper perimeter chassis. Those numbers may sound quite underwhelming, but in an off-road scenario, the performance is more than enough to keep you engaged without being intimidating. First gear is very short, and I found myself in second and third most of the time. A small dab of the light clutch lever gives you a decent kick of power if you need to raise the front wheel over a crest, and there’s enough juice to slide the rear wheel around in the first few gears as well. At the same time, the power also felt completely trustworthy, with no threats of the bike snapping out of control. This is just the sort of performance that a newer off-road rider would enjoy on their journey towards becoming more skilled. Kawasaki KLX230 off-road ability Unfortunately, we didn’t get to try the KLX out on the road, so how it functions as a street bike remains to be seen, but a few safe assumptions can be made. The first is that it won’t be very comfortable for long durations with that thin seat, and the engine probably isn’t geared for easy high-speed cruising either. That being said, the motor feels impressively refined, even when hammering it at redlining speeds off-road. MRF tyres are standard for the Indian market. The MRF tyres that Kawasaki India has equipped this bike with were quite decent on dry, muddy terrain, but you’ll want something more off-road appropriate to properly exploit the bike. While the KLX is designed to look like one of Kawasaki’s angry KX motocross racers, it’s actually quite a gentle thing. The non-adjustable suspension is absorptive and can take in some pretty big hits, but it’s also on the soft side, which makes it easier for less-skilled riders to read the terrain underneath. The braking works well off-road, and you can deactivate the ABS (front and rear) with the push of a button. What I also like is that, despite this being a relatively small bike in Kawasaki’s off-road line-up, it’s still a physically large machine and will fit bigger riders as well. LCD is easy to read, but lacks a gear indicator. By definition, this is a simple, lightweight motorcycle, so don’t expect much in the way of features. That being said, it’s not all bad. It gets a good-looking LED headlamp and a clean LCD that includes ‘luxuries’ like a clock, a fuel gauge, and even Bluetooth compatibility. Jokes aside, the only thing some folks might miss in the display is a gear position indicator. Kawasaki KLX230 verdict and expected price To sum up, I am not as good an off-road rider as I’d like to be, and this is exactly the sort of bike I’d like to spend some time on in the process of getting better. The fact that Kawasaki is going through the pains of bringing this bike to our market alone deserves your appreciation. However, if you’ve been following our news on this bike over the past few months, you’ll have noticed that we reported Kawasaki was working on localising the KLX for our market and that its target price would be around Rs 2 lakh, which would make it a fantastic rival to the Hero Xpulse.  However, the localisation process is still underway, and Kawasaki has decided to bring the bike here as a CKD import for the time being. That means the price will not be as tempting as we hoped, at least not at the start. We were given to understand at the launch event that a price between Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 3 lakh, ex-showroom, is fair to expect, which is not bad but not great either. We’ll know for sure when Kawasaki formally reveals the price at the India Bike Week in early December. The KLX 230 is a handsome, well-made motorcycle. There are two ways to look at this. The first is that it means the KLX will cost very close to the likes of the Himalayan 450, which will undoubtedly be a turn-off for many. The other perspective is that you’ll finally be able to get your hands on a road-legal, quality Japanese dual-sport for a realistic sum of money, and that will undoubtedly be music to some ears. With the way things currently stand, I believe that this bike will find takers, even if it will be quite niche. However, I also believe that Kawasaki would find more success if they brought in the KLX 230 S as well, which is essentially the same motorcycle with reduced suspension travel and a more palatable 845mm seat height. Nevertheless, what’s without doubt is that we’re lucky to finally have the option of a bike like this, and I’m looking forward to spending more time with it. Also See: Kawasaki KLX230 video review",

We’ve featured two of Ek’s custom motorcycles before (a BMW R nineT Urban G/S and a Honda XR600R), and both were heavily inspired by classic Dakar Rally bikes. The man has a taste for 80s and 90s off-roaders, and he knows how to capture that vibe. This time, he’s done it with an unlikely donor—a Honda Monkey.

    "description": "It isn’t often that a new car impresses me as much as the Toyota Hyryder has. The hybrid’s EV-like initial responses, fuel efficiency that’s better than most frugal diesel cars and a likeable package backed by Toyota are some of the reasons why I persuaded my wife to buy the SUV as soon as it was launched. But while I have one at home, it’s hard to pry it away from my wife. So, I grabbed the keys to the one Toyota lent us as a long-termer. I think the Hyryder’s design is very appealing, and its ‘Speedy Blue’ paint makes it quite striking, too. On the inside, the dashboard and doors have a nice leatherette padding, and the brown and black colour scheme certainly lifts the cabin’s perceived quality. You can’t ignore that it shares many parts with lower-priced Marutis, but it isn’t to the extent of feeling cheap or offensive at its Rs 20 lakh price. The Hyryder’s ergonomics are spot on, with plenty of seat, steering and central armrest adjustment for you to get comfortable. However, the seats aren’t the comfiest, and the cushioning results in some body ache on longer drives. At the rear, space is adequate for two adults – it isn’t as wide as the Creta’s – although six-footers will find headroom tight even with the backrest fully reclined. Soft leatherette materials up the cabin’s premium appeal. After several road trips and airport runs, I can confidently say that with a plus-sized check-in bag in the boot, there’s only about enough room for a laptop bag; you can slide a laptop bag into the slim storage beneath the boot floor, too. On either side of the boot, there’s a deep storage area that is useful to stow smaller items. I must talk about the touchscreen and wireless charger as well; the touchscreen’s software is buggy, resulting in frequent disconnection and low call volume when connected to wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. We hope a software update solves this. The wireless charger is also flawed; it suspends charging often without reason, which is very annoying. Wireless phone charger’s erratic functioning is frustrating. Also, the thin sun shade for the sunroof allows the cabin to be soaked in heat far too quickly when parked outdoors. A high-quality sunfilm on the sunroof could alleviate this issue. Though Toyota has connected car tech, the vehicle locator is the only feature I found useful. It also tells you how much fuel is left and the current range, but I would have liked more information, especially related to fuel efficiency, and a trip log. You can’t unlock the vehicle via the app if you don’t use the app to lock it in the first place, which is quite strange. There is a pre-cooling feature, too, that I’ve used only once. Rounding off the not-so-nice bits, when the engine/generator kicks in to charge the lithium-ion battery, the system occasionally makes quite a few sounds, which can take the uninitiated by surprise, and if you’re paying attention, you’ll also feel some vibrations at idle. Hybrid’s drivability and responsiveness are spot on. Now, let’s talk about the things I really love. The first is performance. A seamless and silent electric startup is something I truly appreciate. Next, the electric motor nicely complements the three-cylinder petrol engine, delivering almost electric vehicle-like responses, making it ideal for closing gaps or when overtaking. The torque curve tapers soon after, and the e-CVT makes the engine rev quite a bit when your foot is pinned to the throttle, emanating a rather unpleasant note. But the highlight is its fuel efficiency. In Eco mode, the best I’ve achieved is 26.5kpl, with 80 percent highway driving and the rest in the city. With no effort to drive with the intent of maximising efficiency, the average city efficiency is about 20-21kpl in winter months, and this number drops to 18-19kpl in summer. An insider at Toyota explained that the e-compressor puts a high load on the hybrid system, which explains the lower efficiency when ambient temperatures are higher. Do note that these numbers are measured using the tankful-to-tankful method. i-Connect app is too basic; more info on efficiency, trip log would’ve been nice. Lastly, the Hyryder’s suspension is on the firmer side, but driving manners and steering make it feel very confident at highway speeds. It also exudes an underlying toughness while dealing with poor, broken roads, which, to some extent, makes it similar to its rugged sibling, the Toyota Fortuner. The Hyryder has been a fill-it, shut-it and forget-it car, one that goes about doing all that’s expected of it in a fuss-free and competent manner.

    "description": "Volkswagen, which has lined up multiple electric models at various price points for global debuts, is now looking to bring in more entry-level EVs for the masses. The first among these would be the ID.2, which will have a more conventional design, similar to the German brand’s ICE-powered models, according to our sister publication, Autocar UK. VW to continue to invest in ICE-powered models globally However, it still maintains that the future is electric India to get a Skoda Kaylaq-based compact SUV Future VW car designs: what’s in store? The future design direction taken by Volkswagen will ensure its all-electric ID range will look less seperated from the rest of its line-up. Volkswagen will also continue to invest in ICE architectures and technology and has put no end date on such investments, according to its new sales and marketing boss, Martin Sander. Speaking at the Paris Motor Show, Sander said he was still convinced “the future is electric” despite slowing demand for EVs. Sander added that “the ICE market globally is still that big that we can't put an end date to ICE development today”. “Of course, sooner or later, there will be an end date, determined by customer demand,\" he continued. \"As long as we see customers demanding ICE vehicles, we will have an offer. Importantly, when asked if that would lead to more convergence in the styling of ICE cars and EVs, Sander replied, “Yes.” The first example of this is set to be the production version of the Golf-sized ID.2all concept, which has styling that’s more in line with traditional VWs than the firm’s ID EVs. This raises the potential for two models in VW’s Golf range: an ICE car called Golf that’s built on a traditional architecture and an EV called ID Golf, styled similarly in a more “likeable” way but built on an EV-specific architecture. “I think it’s really important that we have a clear Volkswagen design language,” said Sander, adding, “For the next launches, you will see much more clarity in the way Volkswagen vehicles are designed.” Sander stated that there were no plans to drop the ID badge completely, even if the designs and names of their EVs converge on something more traditionally VW. He also confirmed that Volkswagen was now investigating extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) hybrid technology after its recent surge in popularity in China. Volkswagen line-up for India: what’s the plan? For India, Volkswagen will introduce a Skoda Kylaq-based compact SUV; the facelifts for Taigun and Virtus are also in the pipeline.

    "description": "Nissan is evaluating launching its global flagship SUV, the Patrol, in India sometime in 2026. It could be brought to India as a fully imported unit to serve as a halo model, according to sources. The Patrol recently underwent a full generation change globally (codenamed: Y63) and is currently on sale only in left-hand drive markets, with right-hand drive versions set to arrive a little later. Nissan Patrol could come to India as a CBU in 2026 Will likely be powered by a petrol V6 engine Could be positioned against the upcoming Land Cruiser Prado in India Nissan Patrol to serve as brand builder in India At a time when Nissan, and Renault, are gearing up for a fresh product onslaught with two new mass-market SUVs set to arrive from 2025 onwards, the Patrol could potentially be used to better the brand image for Nissan in India. The rugged, body-on-frame Patrol is a legend in the SUV world and has cemented its reputation as an indestructible model over six generations. Nissan recently tried doing the same with the fully-imported X-Trail in our market, but it received a rather lukewarm response, thanks to it being a comparatively older model and its prohibitive pricing. The Patrol, however, being an all-new and a modern product will be much better placed to do so. Moreover, the Patrol will give Nissan a formidable rival to take on the Toyota LC300, and with the latter also gearing up to launch the new Land Cruiser Prado in India by late 2025, it could give rise to a new segment of XXL-sized 4x4 SUVs.  We reported about Patrol's India launch in the Confidential section of the October 2024 issue. This is not the first time Nissan has considered launching the Patrol in India. Back in 2020, the brand was evaluating the previous-gen Patrol (Y62) for an India launch just as it was gearing up to introduce the Magnite, then too serving as a brand builder in our market. It even conducted multiple customer clinics for the SUV, but ultimately decided against it. Nissan Patrol's global rollout plan Nissan is gradually introducing the new Patrol to its existing markets, although all of it are currently left-hand drive markets. However, demand for the new SUV from markets like Australia, South Africa and even its home market in Japan has prompted Nissan to tool up for RHD versions, and it is expected to launch internationally by 2026. The Patrol currently gets two petrol V6 engine options – a naturally aspirated, 3.8-litre unit and a more powerful, twin-turbocharged 3.5-litre unit – and it is likely one of these will be brought to India; there’s no diesel or a petrol V8 like previous generations of the Patrol. Of course, the Patrol won’t come cheap. Being Nissan’s flagship model globally and a full import, prices will likely be well upwards of Rs 1 crore, ex-showroom.  Also See: New Kia Carnival sold out for nearly a year in India Mitsubishi DST seven seat SUV concept revealed",
