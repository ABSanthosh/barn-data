    "description": "The Crossfire 500 X is a retro-style motorcycle that embodies a mix of vintage aesthetics and modern engineering. It’s positioned as a middleweight bike, aimed at riders who want a stylish, versatile, and performance-oriented machine. Does this Austrian motorcycle have the credentials to carve its niche in the sub 500cc segment? Unfortunately, we were only allowed a glimpse at its performance inside the confines of a private property. Here’s what we discovered.  Brixton Crossfire 500 X design and features Its bold “X” tank design, which has become a signature of the Brixton line-up, tends to stand out. The minimalistic approach to bodywork, paired with LED lighting, gives it a contemporary touch while retaining the retro vibe. The Crossfire 500 X gets a long single-piece seat that felt adequately comfortable during my short stint. Its scrambler styled riding seat has a relatively accessible seat height of 795mm.  A rather budget-looking speedo The bike uses a monotone LCD speedo, which was dim and showed limited information in small fonts, making it hard to read under direct sunlight. Switchgear quality felt budget and should have been better for its asking price. While the overall design is quite eye-catching, fit and finish levels could have been better. Brixton Crossfire 500 X performance and handling The Crossfire 500 X is powered by a 486cc parallel-twin engine that is paired with a 6-speed gearbox and produces 47hp at 8,500rpm and 43Nm at 6,750rpm. Its motor feels torquey and strikes a balance between approachable performance and power delivery. The engine is smooth, with a linear torque curve that makes it easy to handle around tight corners.  It features J.Juan brakes, paired with dual-channel ABS for strong stopping power. However, the brakes lacked feedback and felt rather wooden. This motorcycle is equipped with an adjustable KYB USD fork and monoshock, which are on the softer side. The Crossfire 500 X wafts over uneven surfaces at slow speeds, but wallows over them at higher speeds. Despite that, it felt surprisingly engaging and fun around the tight bends of the premises. Unfortunately, we didn’t get a chance to test this motorcycle on public roads and it remains to be seen how the Crossfire 500 X does in the real world.  While we primarily rode the road-oriented model, Brixton also sells the Crossfire 500 XC, which is a scrambler-styled motorcycle. It is mechanically quite similar but gets larger wheels and a different design. It also costs Rs 45,000 more, and will be sold alongside the Crossfire 500 X through Motohaus’ limited dealership network.  Brixton Crossfire 500 X verdict The 500 X may lack some high-tech features, but its charm lies in its simplicity and seemingly rugged appearance. While it is priced respectably for a CKD, the Crossfire 500 X is significantly more expensive than the 650s from RE, which will be a big challenge for Brixton. LED headlamp design is eye-catching Given that Brixton is a very young brand in India and globally, Its long-term reliability and after-sales service also remain to be seen given the small footprint the brand currently holds.

    "description": "The Ampere Nexus is currently the most premium offering by the brand and has been designed and developed in India. It exists in an extremely competitive space, where it is up against not only legacy OEMs but also established electric vehicle startups. The big question is: Does this new kid on the block have the credentials to hold its own against the rivals? Well, here’s what we discovered. The Nexus is a handsome-looking scooter finished in this shade of Zanskar Aqua. Not only is it bright and eye-catching but it also has a beautiful pearlescent finish under direct sunlight. Its design cues are subtle and tastefully done, and its overall build quality is decent. A deep cubby that’s usable, but the plastic surrounding it is quite sharp. There is a deep storage compartment located under the handlebar, but the shape is odd, and the plastics have a sharp edge, which feels built to a cost. The boot can swallow up most half-face helmets but will struggle with a full-face one, especially with its bulky charger inside. A deep cubby that’s usable, but the plastic surrounding it is quite sharp. In terms of features, the Nexus gets an LED headlight that performs very well and a bright and legible 7-inch TFT display. However, the display isn’t very smooth and, at times, had a delayed response to my touch inputs. The UI could be nicer, and it is also a little harder to use with gloves. 7-inch TFT is legible even under direct sunlight but needs a better UI. While the piano black switchgear looks premium, with its tightly packed buttons, it demands Blackberry levels of muscle memory to use.  Its tightly packed buttons demand muscle memory to use. The charging socket is located near the footboard and looks like a bit of an afterthought. Even the charger looks rather simple and not as well-designed as offerings from its rivals. Unplugging the charger involves pressing two release buttons simultaneously, which can get a little tedious. The charging socket doesn’t look as premium as the rest of the scooter. Despite its simplistic design, this charger is capable of juicing up the Nexus in around four hours. However, a bigger issue is the time it takes for the Nexus to boot up right after charging, which can sometimes take as much as five minutes in my experience. That is something that needs to improve. Overall, while this is a premium scooter, it could do with better attention to detail and finish. Ampere’s Nexus delivers a comfortable and nimble riding experience, making it well-suited for urban commuting. Darting through traffic was an easy affair, and the suspension made little work of any unexpected bumps. I’ve also received good feedback from those pillion riders. The suspension irons out most bumps with ease as long as the speeds are low. With a telescopic fork and twin rear shocks, the overall setup is well-controlled and leaves very little to complain about. Handling is good, and it is only on hard impacts at higher speeds where the scooter will generate an occasional hard thud. All in all, this scooter does a commendable job of striking a good balance between ride and handling. The Nexus features three riding modes: Eco, City and Power. The throttle response is smooth across all modes, ensuring a predictable ride without jerky acceleration. However, it is a bit too dull and reserved up to about 25kph even in City and Power modes. In my experience, these two modes struck a good balance, and I’d often oscillate between them on my commutes. On the other hand, Eco mode is very slow and is best reserved for extreme bumper-to-bumper traffic or to get home on a low battery. For reference, in Eco mode, the Nexus takes over 12 seconds to reach 40kph, whereas the TVS iQube takes a mere 4.63 seconds to do the same. In our tests, the Nexus performed adequately, with a 0-60kph time of 12.98 seconds in Power mode, which makes it one of the slower scooters in its segment. It features a 3kWh LFP battery and sports a peak motor output of 4kW. The Nexus has a certified range of 136km, but in our tests, we managed to extract just under 100km, which is around 10 percent lower than similarly priced rivals with similarly sized batteries. Zanskar Aqua is by far my favourite shade on the Nexus. In City and Power modes, you can expect a range of about 50km to 70km, respectively. Once the battery drops to 10 percent, the Nexus goes into limp mode, which severely limits performance. The Nexus’ braking performance is decent, and the combi braking system works well. However, the brakes require a firm pull and could do with better feedback. In our tests, the Nexus managed to come to a halt from 60kph in 22.04m. For reference, the popular TVS iQube managed to do the same in just 19.71m. The Nexus is a comfortable and endearing electric scooter, but it has areas that need improvement. Ampere’s Nexus is clearly the best-made and most premium offering by the brand yet, but it still has some catching up to do compared to its rivals. The Nexus’ LED headlight provides excellent illumination. The Nexus’ excellent ride quality, comfort and practicality work in its favour and give it a slight edge over its competitors. However, it still needs work on its overall finish and the end-user experience to meet what people have come to expect at this price point. If comfort is all you seek, then the Nexus could be the one for you, but buyers looking for a more polished experience will find other alternatives.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2025-tesla-model-y-overhauled-suv-spotted-testing-europe",
    "description": "World's best-selling car will be rejuvenated to fend off cheaper and longer-range rivals The Tesla Model Y will be substantially updated this year with a new look, an interior overhaul and much improved performance figures. The updated version of the EV, which was the world’s best-selling car in 2023, has now been spotted testing in Europe ahead of its imminent showroom arrival on the continent. The SUV’s immense commercial success makes it Tesla’s most important asset and the American EV maker will look to leverage it in an attempt to move out of a prolonged sales dip, during which it has been without a month-on-month deliveries increase since the end of 2023. The latest test mules of the updated SUV – codenamed Project Juniper – reveal a number of new design elements for a car that has not been updated since its 2020 launch. The most notable is the split-headlight design, which has not previously been seen on a Tesla model and looks to take inspiration from the new Polestar 4.  At the rear, the revised Model Y will be differentiated most obviously from the current car by a new light bar that is notably different from the C-shaped clusters added to the back of the Model 3. Because the car has not been updated in almost five years, it no longer so obviously offers a usability and performance advantage over its rivals. The SUV’s maximum 331-mile range, for example – seen as a headline attribute at its launch – has now been surpassed by cheaper rivals such as the Skoda Enyaq and Peugeot e-3008. Addressing that shortcoming will be a focus of the Model Y’s facelift, as it was for the Model 3, which can now travel up to 8% farther on a charge than it did previously, thanks to extensive revisions to its aerodynamics and electronics. Although it is not immediately apparent from the heavily camouflaged test mules, the Model Y’s revised front end will follow the updated Model 3 in featuring a bumper that has been reshaped to cut through the air more efficiently and boost range while also reducing wind noise at a cruise.  This treatment lowered the Model 3’s drag coefficient from 0.23 to 0.219, making it one of the slipperiest cars on sale. A similar treatment for the SUV could contribute to a range of more than 350 miles in its most efficient form. Another focus of the refresh will be to improve the Model Y’s usability and quality credentials. To that end, the Model 3’s redesigned centre console, new upmarket textiles and 8.0in rear touchscreen are expected to be carried over to the revised Model Y.  One of the more controversial elements of the Model 3’s facelift was the migration of the indicator controls from a stalk to the steering wheel and it remains to be seen whether Tesla will react to criticism of that by retaining the Model Y’s traditional controls. Tesla is not expected to make drastic changes to the powertrain and charging system – the Model Y’s 250kW maximum charge speed is still one of its strong suits – but the top-rung Performance version is likely to receive a significant increase in power to take the fight to the new electric Porsche Macan Turbo.  As an indication, the 453bhp Model 3 Performance cracks 0-62mph in just 3.1sec and achieves a top speed of 163mph. Assuming the Model Y gets close to those figures, it will be one of the fastest crossovers on the market.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/company-cars/some-vehicles-risk-losing-company-car-tax-breaks-due-new-rules",
    "description": "The way plug-in hybrid fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions are calculated changed at the start of this year Some vehicles are at risk of losing company car tax breaks following the 1 January change to the way plug-in hybrid (PHEV) fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions are calculated. These reforms arrive after long-standing criticism that the published fuel economy figures of PHEVs fail to reflect real-world performance, which in turn undermines their contribution to cutting manufacturers’ and fleets’ CO2 output. A PHEV's efficiency is calculated by testing its electric range and then its fuel consumption in hybrid mode. The electric range is used to produce a 'utility factor', a percentage of its total mileage that will be done on battery power. The longer the range, the lower the car’s CO2 emissions, though this assumes drivers plug PHEVs in, and real-world data gathered by the European Environment Agency suggests this isn’t always happening. Across a sample of 373,552 petrol PHEVs, drivers averaged tailpipe CO2 emissions of 134g/km against a published 38g/km – a 254% gap. Diesel PHEVs fared even worse, averaging 155g/km or 326% more CO2 than the 34g/km brochure average. The new Euro 6e-bis test standard is designed to close that gap, by adjusting the utility factor to assume a much lower share of electric driving. In turn, PHEVs will need to offer a far longer electric range to get a significant reduction in CO2 emissions.  Euro 6e-bis applies to new models launched from 1 January 2025, and all new car and van registrations 12 months later. Manufacturers have until 31 December 2025 to re-test their entire line-up, which means published CO2 emissions will change through the year.  Increases can be sizeable. The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) says CO2 emissions for a PHEV with a 70km (42-mile) electric range could more than double, from 45g/km to 96g/km. Leasing company Alphabet has advised fleets to pay close attention, warning that vehicles’ CO2 emissions are set when they are manufactured, so re-testing means some will change between ordering and delivery – especially towards the end of the year.  The ICCT’s sample vehicle would cease to qualify for ultra-low company car tax bands and 100% tax deduction for leased vehicles, because both are capped at 50g/km of CO2. It would also lose the most generous salary sacrifice incentives, which are capped at 75g/km.  Around 80% of new PHEVs are registered to companies, according to the Department for Transport.  Matt Walters, head of consultancy services and customer value at Ayvens, says fleets are already phasing PHEVs out of salary sacrifice schemes in favour of BEVs, especially since the UK government's Autumn Budget confirmed company car tax incentives will be wound down from April 2028.  Walters told Autocar: “Guided by our data-driven insights, we’re working closely with our customers to make them aware of the potential CO2 implications for new-make models and ensure they have the right strategy in place to navigate the upcoming changes. “We’re advising customers to carefully check vehicle specifications before ordering as what they order today might not be type approved yet and could be subject to stricter testing rules. Providing customers look at the vehicle data to inform their choices, they can mitigate any risks when ordering.\"",

    "description": "Every five years, Harley-Davidson releases a fresh slew of special anniversary editions. They’re usually existing models, upgraded with fancy liveries and, in some cases, numbered plaques. But the fact that they come out twice a decade (and in strong numbers) sort of diminishes their allure. It’s little wonder, then, that the owner of this 100th Anniversary Harley Springer Softail had no qualms about handing it over to our man in Taiwan, Winston Yeh, for a Rough Crafts makeover. As implied, the 2003-model Harley-Davidson Springer Softail followed The Motor Co.’s typical Softail formula, with a vintage-style springer front end added to the mix. This particular example had already been dressed in a handful of aftermarket parts, so Winston’s client had no illusions about keeping it stock.…",

Given the caliber of the custom builders that grace these pages, it’s a tall order. Each year’s routine is the same, starting with a ‘short’ list of 30-plus bikes. Once that’s trimmed down to a more palatable size, I eliminate any bikes that have already placed in our ranked Top 10, in the interest of fairness. The remaining candidates are sifted to compile my final selection—which is listed alphabetically, by the builder or workshop’s name. All of the bikes on this list share one trait: they’ve been stuck in my head all year, playing on repeat like mechanical earworms.…",

    "description": "Only here for three quick months that flew by in a flash, the Punch EV didn’t feel like a ‘long’ termer in the same way most of our others do. That is partly due to the fact that it frequently changed hands within the team since everyone wanted to have some time with it, and thus, no one ever used it for a long enough spell. On a less favourable note, it’s also because we’ve actually had two Punch EVs in the fleet, as Tata gave us a temporary replacement car when it took this one in for inspection after it threw up a critical alert in its first week with us, and would not start. Once it was back, the error never showed again, though it was not without other electronic gaffes, such as the camera feeds sometimes going blank, the infotainment system freezing, wireless charging stopping frequently, and my phone being regularly booted out of Android Auto. They really need to address these software gremlins soon. I’m also not a fan of how it has an auditory alert for… everything! Changing drive modes, engaging the parking brake, and even leaving the rear seatbelts unfastened (even without passengers) fires off some form of annoying alert. Show, don’t tell, Tata Motors. No rear load sensors means seat belt warning beeps unless buckled at all times. More time behind the wheel has allowed me to dig into the nuances of the powertrain a bit more. Mixing it up with other EVs, I’ve found Tata’s Acti.ev architecture could do with a bit more refinement. No, I don’t mean the NVH levels (those are excellent), but rather the control weights, brake blending and power delivery. It can feel abrupt and erratic as you move from accelerating to coasting to braking, and with the rapid rate at which EVs are evolving, there are others that now do it more seamlessly.  It’s not, however, enough to take away from the fact this is a great all-round package – and that’s before you even consider its price or its compact and convenient size. I’ve loved my commutes to work in it and the ability to park in the tiniest of spots – an essential trait for a car in Mumbai. Plus, it goes like hell if you want it to and has an almost uncanny ability to absorb even the harshest of bumps at any speed. While I’m far from the most efficient driver, even I managed a superb 6.9km/kWh in the Punch EV. But my colleague Lokesh from our Hindi channel WhatCar? India managed 8.5! The battery may not be huge, but you can really rinse out every cell in this car. Good design, light colours give it a premium feel inside. Perhaps the brevity of its tenure has also afforded me a greater appreciation of its light-coloured interior since I’m not the one who’s going to have to get it detailed every second month. When it’s clean, though, the effect it has is tremendous – as if it’s trickled down directly from Tata-owned Range Rover. Even the steering wheel is dual-tone leatherette-wrapped, grey and cream, which is a bold choice in an entry-level EV, and then there’s the liberal use of gloss black plastic that looks great, though it is prone to smudges, scratches and reflections. Helpful battery, charging data on screens (when they work). There is a sense with this car, and a lot of Tata models if I’m honest, that design comes first and foremost, whether inside or out, and I like that. The brand’s family aesthetic runs through the Punch EV, and it extends not just to the bodywork and upholstery but also to the screen graphics. Yes, those screens may glitch, and the text is too small in places, but boy, do they look good! They’re colourful, clean, and actually pack in a good amount of data and features. Tata’s EV reign may have plateaued – the MG Windsor even took the top spot on the sales charts – but that appears more a function of market trends. The brand does need to sort out its electric and electronic gremlins immediately, which is something that’s plaguing the ICE models, too. Because once they do, the model range on offer is nothing short of impressive, and it’s only growing. As I’ve said before, there are bigger, better Tata EVs, but the Punch EV is a concentrated distillation of everything the brand has done so far. Will we have another electric Tata in our fleet soon? I hope so. Also see: Tata Punch EV long term review, 7,000km report Tata Punch EV review: Feels like a mini-Nexon EV",

    "description": "Beating a Porsche on the legendary Nürburgring is no mean feat, especially when the Porsche in question is the Cayenne Turbo GT Coupé. But the 2025 Audi RS Q8 Performance did just that. A full-size SUV with 640hp and enough tech for an Engineering Explained video, the RS Q8 Performance might look like a standard Q8 with some blacked-out bits, but that’s the kind of thought that will have you gasping at its performance. We had it for a whole day on a race track and in the Spanish countryside to see what all is new and how much of a difference it has made. 2024 Audi RS Q8 exterior design  On the face of it, the RS Q8 Performance continues with stern expressions and almost no emotion. There is no smiling grille or angry air vents; it’s sleek, sharp and means business. What’s new over the older version are the LED Matrix headlamps with multiple daytime running lights (DRLs) options and a re-profiled grille finished in gloss black with a 3D honeycomb pattern. Wrapped around the grille is a massive carbon-fibre frame, and there’s more carbon fibre on the front lip and air vents. LED Matrix headlamps are standard. The bumpers are sportier and more aggressive than before, and what’s really nice to see is that there isn’t an ounce of chrome to be seen anywhere on the car. Over to the side, the optional 23-inch wheels look stunning (22-inch come as standard), and these help shave 20kg off the total SUV’s weight. Hidden behind these large rims are massive 420mm carbon-ceramic brake discs (standard on the Performance version) with red brake calipers. Carbon fibre on the outside rearview mirrors finishes off the changes at the side. OLED tail-lamps get customisable DRL designs. At the rear, the RS Q8 Performance gets OLED tail-lamps conjoined by an LED light bar, some more honeycomb pattern on the bumper, and a gloss-black diffuser with carbon-fibre surrounds for the oval exhaust tips. Dramatic is not something you’d call the RS Q8 Performance, despite its many oversized bits and plenty of carbon-fibre trimmings (courtesy of the optional Carbon Pack). It’s the perfect look for the introverted car guy, especially in the subtle Satellite Silver paint shade. 2024 Audi RS Q8 interior and features  On the inside, the introversion is even more pronounced as there is little that will ‘wow’ you. As standard, the Performance version gets the Sport Seats Plus; these seats offer lots of bolstering and are also very comfy for long drives. And there is the same honeycomb pattern with Race-Tex and all-black upholstery. But barring all that, it’s all very simple – very high-quality, but nothing that will make it look fast while stationary. Even the steering, which was a chunky flat-bottom one on the previous car, is now a simple round unit. The racy one has been tucked away in the options list. However, you can choose between red, blue or grey for the upholstery contrast stitching. For anything more, like maybe a panoramic sunroof, you’d have to start ticking the options list. Its interior oozes quality but lacks the drama you’d expect from a 640hp super SUV. The centre console features the all-too-familiar dual-screen layout, and apart from the RS modes and drive settings, it’s all very simple and straightforward. At the rear, the RS Q8 Performance has enough space for three adults, and there’s four-zone climate control with electric sun blinds for added comfort. But would you want to be chauffeured in a 640hp super SUV? I think not. 2024 Audi RS Q8 performance  Performance is literally this RS Q8’s name, and it is truly mind-boggling. Sure, it has beaten the Cayenne around the Nürburgring, but what does that mean? Is it fun? Or is it a weapon to be wielded only in the hands of a professional test driver? To find out, we did a few laps around the Parcmotor Castelloli in Spain, and a few laps is all it took to showcase why and how this is the fastest SUV around the Nürburgring. Powering the RS Q8 Performance is a 4.0-litre, twin-turbo V8, as before, but it now makes 40hp more, bringing it to 640, while max torque is 850Nm. The 0-100kph sprint takes an astounding 3.6 seconds, and the SUV can haul all the way to the good side of 305kph. The increase in power is the result of the catalytic converter’s repositioning, which, in turn, has reduced exhaust back pressure. The turbo boost pressures are also higher now, and the end result is an engine with virtually no lag. To add to this instant boost is a 48V mild-hybrid system that lends a hand during acceleration, which means no matter how tight the corner, you can exit it with all the brute force available. The real star is the nimble chassis. The 8-speed Tiptronic gearbox is rapid, too, but select Dynamic Plus or any of the RS modes, and it shifts with lightning-fast speeds. The paddle shifters are also quite responsive, and in manual mode, you can have total control of the shifts. On straightways, the acceleration is a blur, and given the SUV’s driving position, it’s hard to believe that you can be seated this high up and travel this fast. The sense of speed is immense, and the engine sounds terrific at full pitch. Audi has a reputation for making silent cars, but in this, it actually removed some of the sound insulation so you can hear even more of the engine noise on the inside! After all those e-trons, this sure comes as a welcome change. Out on the public roads, however, the engine changes character in a flash. Swap from the Dynamic or RS mode to Comfort mode, and it puts the leash and muzzle on the engine instantly. You can amble through town without being noticed and in comfort. The engine has a soft burble, which only amplifies post 4,000rpm and, of course, through tunnels. The ease of driving it as a daily driver takes you by surprise, especially if you’ve been hooning it around a racetrack an hour ago. 2024 Audi RS Q8 ride and handling  Speaking of hooning around a racetrack, pin-point handling is not something you expect from an SUV the size of the RS Q8 Performance. Yet, thanks to all the wizardry under the skin, it corners like it has an identity crisis. It refuses to acknowledge it is an SUV; instead, it identifies as a hot hatch. Many things are at play here – active roll stabilisation, all-wheel steering, Adaptive Air Suspension Sport and the new Quattro Sport differential – words you’d find in engineering textbooks but with the effect you’d find in comic books. The RS Q8 Performance holds the lap record on the Nürburgring for the fastest production SUV. The RS Q8 Performance corners with absolutely no body roll or understeer, and despite the power and torque available on tap, it always has the grip to save you. A lap record definitely needs precision, which the RS Q8 has, but even for mortals with not even a fraction of the pro talent, it is very hard to look bad on the track. The power split is 40-60 as standard, but in case of slippage, it can send up to 70 percent power up ahead and 85 percent to the rear wheels. Then, there is the electromechanical active stabilisation, which is basically a motor between two halves of the anti-roll bar. On long, straight highways, the two halves are disconnected, which reduces pitching and vertical movements, but as soon as you get to the corners, they link up and twist the bar in the opposite direction to the turn, thereby reducing roll and keeping the car as level as possible. It sounds complicated, but when you notice the steering is on full lock and you haven’t keeled over in your seat, it makes sense. Ride comfort with large 23-inch wheels is surprisingly good. Ride comfort is also surprisingly good, given the weight and, more importantly, the large 23-inch rims with low-profile tyres. The adaptive air suspension is compliant in Comfort mode and tries its best on broken patches, but for Indian conditions, the 22-inch ones will undoubtedly be more comfortable. 2024 Audi RS Q8 verdict and India launch details  Audi has not confirmed the RS Q8 Performance for India as of now, but given the strong response to the older version, it is likely to make it back to home soil in 2025. Prices would be slightly higher than the outgoing version, but you can expect it to be extremely competitive against its arch-rivals, the Lamborghini Urus S and Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT. As a performance SUV, the RS Q8 ticks all the boxes. It is large, mighty fast and loud enough to shake up the mountains, and best of all, incredible to handle, too. It does not have the flash of a supercar or super SUV, but not everyone wants that kind of attention all the time. For those who love the concept of a ‘sleeper’ or discreet performance, this is what you should get your hands on – enough space and comfort to drop the kids off to school or do an airport run and enough power to never be late.

    "description": "Mahindra has sold over 5 lakh SUVs for the first time in a calendar year. With the company announcing its December 2024 wholesales numbers, annual sales for 2024 add up to 5,28,460 units, which constitutes a robust year-on-year increase of 22 percent (CY2023: 4,33,172 units). Scorpio twins account for 32 percent of total Jan-Nov 2024 despatches  Mahindra Bolero wholesales at 93,850 units at end-November 2024 XUV700, XUV 3XO and Thar range are placed 3rd, 4th and 5th Mahindra model-wise sales in 2024 While the model-wise sales split for the Mahindra SUV portfolio for December 2024 is not yet available, the wholesales numbers for the first 11 months of the year give a good indication of the key growth drivers. The Mahindra Scorpio, available as the Scorpio N and Scorpio Classic, is currently the best-selling model for the company. At 1,54,169 units sold between January and November, the Scorpio twins accounted for 32 percent of Mahindra’s total despatches in the first 11 months of 2024. In No. 2 position is the indefatigable and sturdy workhorse, the Bolero, with 93,850 units. The Bolero is followed by the flagship XUV700 (83,390 units) and the XUV300/XUV 3XO (78,826 units). The fifth bestseller M is the Thar-Thar Roxx combine (69,354 units).  Meanwhile, the all-electric XUV400 has clocked total dispatches of 7,188 units in the first 11 months of FY2024. End-November 2024 saw Mahindra launch two brand-new e-SUVs in the form of the BE 6 and XEV 9E. The company’s EV sales will take off from January when the two zero-emission models, which have drawn a strong customer response, enter select showrooms across the country. Mahindra total sales in 2024 Having crossed 50,000-unit sales in a month for the first time in September 2024, Mahindra followed it up with a best-ever 54,504 units in the festival-laden October (up 25 percent) and has clocked despatches of 46,222 units in November (up 16 percent). December 2024 numbers were a more sedate 41,424 units, up 18 percent YoY, despite it being the last month of the year when typically new vehicle buyers prefer to defer their purchase decisions to the new year. In India’s highly competitive UV market, Mahindra, which has 10 SUVs (Bolero, Bolero Neo, Bolero Neo+, Scorpio, Scorpio N, Scorpio Classic, Thar, Thar Roxx, XUV 3XO, XUV400 and XUV700), is extremely well placed to capitalise on the surging demand for this vehicle type. Compared to CY2023, Mahindra despatched an additional 95,288 SUVs in CY2024 and surpassed the 5 lakh wholesales milestone for the first time in a calendar year (5,28,460 units). Even on the fiscal year front, the company is well set to record its best-ever sales and achieve the 5,00,000 milestone for the first time in a fiscal. With three months left to go for FY2025 to come to a close, Mahindra’s sales of 4,02,360 units in the first nine months of the current fiscal (FY2025) to date are already 87 percent of the SUV maker’s record sales of 4,59,877 units in FY2024. At present, it is just 57,517 units away from that figure and 97,640 units from the 5 lakh milestone.
