    "description": "This 1966 Shelby Mustang GT350H was first delivered to City Motors of National City, California, in March 1966, and is believed to have been retained by Hertz until 1977. It was acquired by its first private owner at that time, repainted, and stored for ~12 years, and in 1989 it changed hands before further restoration work was performed. It later served as the model for the Lane Collectibles 1:18-scale model of the car and was featured in the February 2000 issue of Mustang Illustrated, and it was purchased by the selling dealer from the Carroll Collection of Jackson, Michigan, in 2021. Its 289ci HiPo V8 has a cast aluminum high-rise intake manifold and a Holley four-barrel carburetor, and it is linked to a three-speed automatic transmission and a 9\" rear end. The car rides on 14\" Magnum 500 wheels and has front disc brakes, a steel-reinforced fiberglass hood, and a dual exhaust system with an H-pipe and glasspack mufflers, while the cabin features low-back front bucket seats with latch-and-link lap belts as well as a fold-down Sport Deck rear seat, a woodgrain steering wheel, and a push-button AM radio. This GT350H is now offered with owner's manuals, historical ownership documents and license plates, service and refurbishment records, various tags and decals, Shelby American Automobile Club email correspondence, a copy of the Shelby factory invoice, diecast models, a period advertisement, a copy of Mustang Illustrated magazine in which the car appeared, and a Michigan title.",

    "description": "Launched in 2022 as Kia’s first EV in India, the EV6 has always stood out for its striking design, innovative cabin and punchy performance. There’s now an updated version out that promises more range, and we’ve put it through its paces to see how it performs. Kia EV6 Range and Efficiency - 9/10 Larger 84kWh battery translates into an impressive 498km combined real-world range. Composed road manners, hushed cabin make it a relaxing drive. With this facelift, the EV gets a new, larger 84kWh Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) battery, replacing the older 77.4kWh unit. This new battery is not only more energy-dense but also lighter. The WLTP range has increased to 581km, up by 53km. Impressively, in real-world conditions, we managed a combined range of 498km, which is closer than usual to the official figure. City driving yielded an efficiency of 5.18km/kWh, which translates to a usable range of around 435km. Interestingly, highway efficiency was even better at 6.67km/kWh, delivering a range of approximately 560km. It’s worth noting, however, that ambient temperatures rose by 12 degrees during our city run, which meant the AC was working harder to keep the cabin cool, impacting efficiency. Also, while we used Level 3 (out of 4) regen braking in the city, it wasn’t strong enough to bring the car to a complete halt and didn’t recoup much. As for charging, the EV6 supports ultra-fast DC charging at speeds of up to 350kW, allowing it to go from 10 to 80 percent in just 18 minutes. Kia EV6 Exterior Design and Engineering - 9/10 Gets new headlights, bumpers and alloys; still based on the born-EV E-GMP skateboard platform. On the outside, changes to the EV6 are subtle but impactful. The most noticeable update is the new headlights, which now feature a hook-like LED DRL signature, adding to the futuristic appeal, and there’s a full-width LED strip connecting the headlights. The facelift is offered exclusively in the sportier GT-Line trim in India. There are new bumpers at both ends and a fresh design for the 19-inch alloy wheels. Minor tweaks to the LED elements in the rear lightbar further refine the appearance. Under the skin, it continues to be based on the E-GMP skateboard platform, with its advanced 800V electrical architecture, shared with the Hyundai Ioniq 5. The EV6 remains a substantial car, measuring nearly 4.7 metres in length and 1.9 metres in width, with a generous 2.9-metre wheelbase. Kia EV6 Interior Space and Comfort - 8/10 Comfy front seats feature heating, ventilation and a zero-gravity mode; rear seat wide enough for three adults, but you’re sat in a knees-up position. Rear is spacious for three, but you’re sat knees-up. Step inside, and you’ll find that the cabin retains its familiar layout but with some updates. A more conventional three-spoke steering wheel replaces the old two-spoke unit, the dashboard gets new textures, and the screens get new software and a user interface. The twin 12.3-inch high-definition screens are crisp and intuitive, with logically arranged menus. While they operate smoothly, they are prone to reflections, and the new minimalist themes, though modern, can appear a bit sparse. It’s also worth noting that the fingerprint scanner seen at the Auto Expo 2025 is absent in the version on sale. New UI is easy to use, logically laid out, and follows a minimalist theme. Comfort levels are high, especially in the front seats, which offer firm but supportive cushioning. A standout feature is the zero-gravity mode, allowing the front occupants to fully recline and relax when the car is stationary. The rear bench is spacious enough to accommodate three adults with ease. There’s ample knee and headroom, and the backrest reclines for additional comfort. However, thigh support is compromised due to the high floor, and window blinds have been given a miss. Boot space stands at a respectable 490 litres, but the compartment is shallow. There’s also a frunk, though it’s small at 20 litres.   Kia EV6 Performance and Refinement - 9/10 Performance is strong and feels seamless to drive; wind and road noise is well-contained. The EV6 continues with the same dual-motor setup, producing 325hp and 605Nm. The claimed 0-100kph time is 5.3sec (just 0.1sec slower than before), but we managed a quicker 5.16sec in our testing. Roll-on acceleration is impressive too, with 20-80kph despatched in 2.77sec and 40-100kph in 3.49sec. Performance, then, remains a strong suit. The EV6 feels very natural to drive, thanks to well-calibrated acceleration. Unlike EVs of old, the EV6 serves up its power in a progressive manner rather than in one big chunk, which aids drivability. The all-wheel-drive system also ensures excellent traction, helping put down the power effectively. Drive modes alter the car’s behaviour – Eco softens responses to maximise efficiency, Sport sharpens everything up, and Individual lets drivers customise settings to their preference.

When it comes to ride and handling, the EV6 strikes a good balance. Around corners, it feels confident and composed, with good grip levels. The steering offers decent weight in Sport, though it lacks feedback. Despite riding on large 19-inch wheels, the EV6 maintains good ride comfort. It can feel a touch firm at lower speeds but settles nicely as you go faster, delivering a pliant and absorbent ride. There are some vertical movements at higher speeds, but they’re well-contained. Cabin insulation is impressive, too, with minimal wind or road noise. Kia EV6 Features and Safety - 9/10 Features two 12.3-inch screens, Meridian audio system, ADAS tech and has V2V, V2L capabilities.  The EV6 remains generously equipped. Highlights include a sunroof, heated and ventilated front seats, two 12.3-inch displays, wireless smartphone integration, wireless charging, ambient lighting, a head-up display, and a top-tier 14-speaker Meridian audio system. A larger sunroof would’ve helped the sense of space, especially given that the upholstery is black. On the safety front, it features 8 airbags, a 360-degree camera, and a comprehensive ADAS suite. This includes adaptive cruise control, autonomous emergency braking, and lane-keep assist. Additionally, the EV6 supports both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-load (V2L) functions, enabling it to charge other EVs or power external appliances. Kia EV6 Price and Verdict - 7/10 A well-rounded and premium package, with great real-world performance and range. Imported as a completely built unit (CBU), the Kia EV6 facelift is priced at Rs 65.97 lakh (ex-showroom, India), which positions it higher than its rivals, such as the Ioniq 5, BMW iX1 LWB and BYD Sealion 7. However, some dealerships are offering substantial discounts, which could bring it into your budget. Overall, the Kia EV6 continues to impress with its futuristic styling, premium interiors, and generous features list. Performance remains strong, and the improved real-world range makes it even more appealing. While it may lack a premium badge, the EV6 delivers a genuinely premium experience and stands out as one of the most well-rounded EVs on sale today.

    "description": "Mercedes’ van-based MPV offers economical diesel engines and up to eight seats, but it commands a hefty premium compared with rivals One can make a case that it’s vans such as the Mercedes V-Class – and not the SUVs we’re plied with – that today come closest to mastering the art of the lifestyle vehicle.It’s why you find so many MPV owners, never to return to the SUV fold, eulogising the utility and surprising opulence of their boxy (and sometimes quite expensive) wheels.Playing into this is the fact that the ‘van with windows’ market has recently become more desirable and competitive than ever. Volkswagen has its understatedly charming Multivan; Ford’s Tourneo Custom has a panoramic roof; and the new Lexus LM, with its Mark Levinson sound system, is pitched as something to go up against the BMW 7 Series.As an established player in this area (one in which its compatriots Audi and BMW still have never so much as dabbled), Mercedes-Benz needs to keep up, and so it has updated the V-Class for 2024, with a sharper exterior design and an overhaul of the infotainment system.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/slate-designer-people-deserve-have-car-they-can-afford",
    "description": "Tisha Johnson previously spent several years working for Volvo | Image: Getty Images It's no good having a cheap car if nobody wants it, believes Tisha Johnson, designer of the innovative Slate Truck The design boss of Slate Auto, the American start-up backed by Amazon that plans to launch a bare-bones, £20,000 electric pick-up truck in 2027, believes “people deserve to have a car that they can afford” and the concepts of desirability and affordability should be “inseparable”.  Speaking to the Autocar Meets podcast from the Car Design Event in Munich, Tisha Johnson said the “clear, overwhelming response” to the Slate Truck’s unveiling last month has been “oustanding and somehow surprising” but ultimately reflective of the public’s desire for more affordable yet still attractive cars. Prior to joining Slate, Johnson spent several years at Volvo’s North American design studio, primarily focused on interior development, before taking a break from the automotive industry with stints at appliance manufacturer Whirlpool and furniture maker Herman Miller. Asked if those experiences have informed the utilitarian, functional design of the Truck, and whether it could be considered an appliance rather than a car, Johnson said: “I haven’t contemplated it as an appliance. When we first started talking about what we were going to do, there were two objectives that were inseparable. The first thing was to provide affordable transportation, a car that people could afford, and the second was to make it desirable. “And that is exactly why I knew I was in the right place, because [those things] should be inseparable. People deserve to have a car that they can afford.” Johnson said that the Slate project appealed specifically to her desire to have a “meaningful impact for society and on people's lives” and gave her an opportunity to fulfil a prevailing career ambition: “It was concerning to me that I hadn't delivered affordable mobility, an affordable car, to people.” Indeed, the Slate Truck is tipped to be one of the most affordable pick-ups – electric or otherwise – on sale in the US, with a targeted start price of just $27,000 (£20k) before incentives. That puts it roughly on a par with the entry-level, petrol-engined Ford Maverick and makes it roughly half the price of the Ford F-150 Lightning - currently America’s cheapest electric truck.  Crucial to the Slate’s low list price – and, Johnson argues, its mass appeal – is a bare-bones cabin that eschews much of the advanced technology and equipment common to new cars, featuring manual seats, no stereo as standard and a device mount in place of a touchscreen, for example.  “We're not showing up with a bunch of fancy screens that some would say are corrupting the interior environment,” said Johnson. “We just respect the fact that people know what they want in their own tech that they're carrying with them. Let them nest their phone or a tablet, if they want to, and then just get back to the act of driving.” As well as helping customers to “declutter their lives”, this helps to keep the cost of manufacturing down and for Slate to “pass dollars back to our customers”. It’s an approach similar to that taken by the Dacia Spring and Citroën ë-C3, among Europe’s cheapest electric cars, but Johnson said Slate wasn't directly influenced by the tactics of other value-focused car makers. “We understood our industry and we will continue to recognise what's in the landscape, but I would say we are probably the least influenced by the directionality of industry players,” she said.  The second part of Slate’s ethos – that affordable cars can still be desirable – manifests in an endless array of personalisation options for the Truck, ranging from vibrant liveries and chunky cladding, to different wheel designs and even the choice of bodystyle - with DIY kits available that turn the Truck into a compact, straight-backed SUV or a fastback crossover as needed or desired. Johnson said the aim was that “the person looking at it can overlay some interesting possibilities, and that's exactly what Slate is; it’s just full of possibilities.  “First and foremost, we want people to love the car, and that emotional impact and experience was prime for us as a design group: really evoking an emotional response, love in particular.” The commercial implications of this approach are significant, too: Slate is able to build just one basic model line at its factory in Indiana, thereby minimising its tooling and supply chain costs, yet appeal to as wide a demographic as possible. “We kept it simple: one vehicle type that is manufactured off the line and then tons of possibilities from there,” said Johnson. “It's really an intentional turn in a different direction.” Could slate go global? In a word, no. At least not immediately. Johnson said the nascent company is “focused on an American truck that we can deliver in the US; that is fully our focus”. The Truck has been designed precisely to appeal to American customers and to comply with all the US’s light commercial vehicle (LCV) homologation rules, and the possibility of exporting it worldwide isn't currently on the radar. The UK’s rules about importing and registering foreign vehicles are much more lax than the US’s, though (making it fairly easy to get a new Ford F-150, for example), so the prospect of running a Slate left-hooker on British roads in the next few years isn’t off the cards.",

    "description": "The exact definition of ‘café racer‘ is often debated, but it holds a special meaning for Kenji Heianzan, founder of the Japanese workshop Minami Motorcycle. “We pursue what we call the ‘Way of the Café,’” he tells us. “It’s a philosophy that values quiet confidence, balance, and street presence, without pretense.” Minami Motorcycle is a small two-man operation based in Meguro—a quiet residential ward in Tokyo. They have a particular affinity for iconic Japanese bikes like the Honda CB750, and they love simplicity. “Our approach to customization is one of subtraction rather than addition,” says Heianzan-san, “enhancing the motorcycle’s natural lines and structural beauty without relying on flashy parts or excessive shine. We believe the highest compliment is when someone asks, ‘Was this bike sold like this from the factory?’”…",

    "link": "https://www.bikeexif.com/triumph-bonneville-t120-street-tracker",
    "description": "The modern Triumph Bonneville T120 is a true sleeper. Its gentlemanly aesthetic follows the traditional Bonneville formula, but its rumbling parallel-twin motor kicks out 105 Nm of torque at just 3,500 rpm. It’s handsome and remarkably comfortable—and it’s not shy about getting down. This Triumph Bonneville T120 street tracker from China’s Mandrill Garage is an entirely different beast. It’s shed the T120’s mild-mannered looks for a muscular vibe—one that, if we’re being honest, would make a fine addition to Triumph’s current model range. Based in Beijing, Mandrill is more than just a custom bike garage. They run a bar and restaurant too, flexing their creative muscles with everything from cocktails to clothing. Their eclecticism is reflected in their custom motorcycles, which typically feature contemporary lines, high-end finishes, and vibrant liveries—just like this T120.…",

    "description": "Ducati’s Monster range is set to receive an update with an all-new 890cc engine, and now, the first few shots of the test mule have surfaced online. Here’s everything we can deduce from the spy shots.   The next-gen Ducati Monster will feature the all-new 890cc engine It will feature an all-new rear subframe with a redesigned main frame Its engine radiator is noticeably larger to aid cooling Next-gen Ducati Monster spotted testing We expect this next-gen Monster to be unveiled in 2026 Just a day after our report on Ducati’s plans to equip the Monster and Desert X with its all-new 890cc engine, the first spy shots of the next-gen Monster have surfaced online.  Visually, the crankcase and engine shape are clearly different, confirming that this isn’t the outgoing 937cc Testastretta motor. The radiator appears to be larger and longer than the outgoing model. The rear subframe has been completely redesigned, and we expect the main frame to be revised as well, in line with Ducati’s new-gen 890cc models. The catalytic converter looks bulkier, and Ducati seems to be future-proofing the next-gen Monster for the next few cycles of emissions norms.  Not much can be made out about the next-gen Monster’s design because the test mule seen still appears to be an early one and has rather spartan bodywork. What can be discerned, however, is that the Monster will stick with its trademark round headlight, and the new 890 is likely to be even more svelte than the current-generation Monster.

    "description": "Volkswagen opened bookings for the Golf GTI in India on May 5, 2025, and all 150 units from the first batch are already booked. Although it was earlier reported that 250 Golf GTI units would be imported, VW could only secure 150 units for the first lot, and allotments were made based on an online quiz. To qualify, participants had to score at least 4 out of 5, after which they got a pre-booking link limited to one entry per mobile number. It should be noted that these are pre-launch bookings, and cancellations may happen after the price is announced, giving others a chance to get an allocation.  Golf GTI will pack a 265hp, 2-litre turbo-petrol engine It has a 12.9-inch touchscreen similar to the one in the Tiguan R-Line The VW hatchback will come in four colour options Volkswagen Golf GTI price estimate, delivery timeline Price announcement likely in May As per our dealer sources, the Golf GTI’s on-road price is expected to be around Rs 60 lakh, and the official announcement will likely happen later this month. Deliveries will commence in June from select dealerships across India.   Volkswagen Golf GTI engine and gearbox 265hp 2-litre turbo petrol engine paired with 7DCT  The India-spec Volkswagen Golf GTI will have a 2-litre TSI engine generating an impressive 265hp and 370Nm of peak torque and will be the most powerful Volkswagen car in India, surpassing even the recently launched 204hp Tiguan R-Line SUV. The hot hatch will feature a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox that sends power to the front wheels and an electronically controlled front-axle differential lock. Golf GTI has a claimed 0-100kph time of just 5.9 seconds, with top speed electronically limited to 250kph. The car will rival the Mini Cooper S, which, for reference, has a 204hp 2-litre turbo-petrol engine and a 0 to 100kph sprint time of 6.6 seconds. Volkswagen Golf GTI exterior and interior highlights Exterior An illuminated VW logo sits between the LED headlights, while the front bumper has a large honeycomb-patterned air dam flanked by X-shaped fog lights. The Golf GTI gets a red ‘GTI’ badge on the front doors, with a strip bridging the headlamps and the brake callipers finished in the same colour. It rides on 18-inch alloy wheels, and the rear boasts smoked LED tail-lights, a prominent roof spoiler and twin exhaust tips. Volkswagen will offer the Golf GTI in four colours: Grenadilla Black, Oryx White, Moonstone Grey Black and Kings Red. Interior The Golf GTI’s cabin has a leather-wrapped sports steering wheel with a GTI badge, paddle shifters, a 12.9-inch touchscreen and a 10.25-inch driver’s display (Digital Cockpit Pro in VW speak). Other highlights include a 7-speaker sound system, wireless charging, ambient lights and a panoramic sunroof. Additionally, it will come with tartan seat upholstery, just like the international model, and will include red accents for a sporty touch.
