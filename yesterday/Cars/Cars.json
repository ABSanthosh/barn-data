    "description": "Renault 5 is priced from £22,995; winning Techno trim with 52kWh battery is £26,995 Autocar sibling and consumer champion crowns retro hatchback for desirability, comfort and value The Renault 5 has been named What Car? Car of the Year for 2025. The electric hatchback impressed the judges from Autocar’s sibling title for being comfortable, desirable and “very well priced”. It’s the first Renault to take top honours at the annual ‘motoring Oscars’ since the original Scenic won in 1997 and marks the French brand’s fourth victory since the awards began in 1978. It's also the fourth EV to have won What Car?'s Car of the Year award, following the Kia e-Niro (2019), Kia EV6 (2022) and Volkswagen ID Buzz (2023). “It’s a car that you can buy with your head and your heart, and one that proves you don’t have to spend a fortune to get a great electric vehicle at a time when the costs of motoring are more challenging than ever,” said What Car? editor Steve Huntingford. This comes after the 5 and its hot hatch sibling, the Alpine A290, were jointly named Car of the Year 2025 by a panel of 60 European journalists including Autocar editor Mark Tisshaw.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/kia-pv5-electric-van-make-uk-debut-29-april",
    "description": "Kia PV5 is the centrepiece of a new line-up of electric commercial vehicles Production version of new PV5 will make its UK debut on 29 April at the CV Show Kia will launch its electric van business in the UK on 29 April when the production version of the PV5 makes its national debut at the Commercial Vehicle Show. The PV5 was first shown in concept form at the CES electronics show in Las Vegas last year and prototypes have recently been spotted testing in Europe ahead of an imminent reveal. It is the first in a range of vans planned by the Korean manufacturer, with the concept having been unveiled alongside a smaller PV1 and PV3, as well as the Mercedes Sprinter-sized PV7. Kia said the PV5 will be offered with a seven-year, 100,000-mile warranty as standard, and connectivity with the Geotab fleet management platform will be offered too. Paul Philpott, president and CEO of Kia UK, told Autocar earlier this month that deliveries of the PV5 will begin “during Q4” – so between October and December – and that launching vans is an “important extension of our brand”.  He added: “[It’s] a pretty significant marketplace. Another 350,000 vans go on sale every year and there's a piece of that pie that we've had nothing of, that we can add to our car business.” Everything you need to know about Kia's new vans Kia will enter the world of commercial vehicles in 2025 with an electric van called the PV5. The Kia PV5, revealed at CES in Las Vegas, is the first of a future line-up of what Kia calls PBVs, which stands for Platform Beyond Vehicle. Kia has shown off several concept versions of these PBVs at CES alongside the PV5, including the smaller PV1 and PV3 and larger PV7, as well as different versions of the PV5 itself, as part of plans to ramp up its offering of multi-purpose vehicles in the coming decade. The PV5 will be launched first, in 2025, and is the first model to come from a new factory in Korea – with an initial capacity of 150,000 units per year – designed solely to produce PBVs using a bespoke and more flexible manufacturing process. The PV5 is 4.7 metres long and has a punchy target price of €35,000 (£30,600) for an entry-level model, although what size battery it will have and the indicated range have yet to be disclosed. A longer-wheelbase version is possible. It will be built on a specially adpated version of the E-GMP platform used on the likes of the Kia EV6 and new Kia EV9 electric cars. Unlike those EVs, the PV5 is natively front-wheel drive and has a 400V electrical architecture rather than an 800V one. Two versions of the PV5 confirmed to be offered at launch are the seven-seat People Mover – a rival to the new electric Ford Tourneo Custom – and the High Roof panel van, which maximises cargo space. Kia is targeting small and medium businesses, including utility companies, with this van initially. The pair of PV5s is set to reach the UK in 2025. The People Mover will appeal to taxi companies. Kia has confirmed that it's in talks with Uber about a supply deal and indicated that the ride-hailing giant was influencing elements of the PV5's design and configuration. There are also plans for an autonomous Robotaxi version of the PB5, which has been previewed at CES as the PV5-R. A production date of 2028 is mooted for this model, which will have level-four autonomous capabilities. As such, its introduction will be limited by legislation.  The final version of the PV5 is a pick-up truck, although Kia admits this is more to show the configurability of the platform rather than a model with production intent. The company does have plans for a combustion-engined pick-up in some global markets, but that's separate from this project.  The one fixed element of the interior of all the PV5 models is the \"driver zone\" cabin, with the rest customisable through the use of various interchangeable modules. For example, the area traditionally used for a passenger seat can serve as a secure area for holding luggage, while a variety of seat types can be placed in a number of layouts. The launch of the PV5 is what Kia calls phase one of a three-phase project concerning PBVs. The second phase will include the launch of the production PV7, which has been previewed as a CES concept also.  The PV7 will be offered in lengths ranging from five to 5.7 metres and will go into production in 2027. This will also be natively front-wheel-drive but will offer four-wheel drive as an option and be equipped with the 800V electrical architecture for faster charging.  Phase two will also include the roll-out of new software for the PBVs that will use artifical intelligence to ensure that they're always up to date. Phase three is more conceptual and not planned until at least 2032, but it envisions a whole network of different-sized PBVs able to interact with one another across multiple uses and business needs. The other two PBVs previewed, the PV1 and PV3, aren't yet planned for production. Kia admits the PV3 is too similar to the PV5 for now but will invite businesses to suggest use cases for it, which may yet result in it being made. The PV1 is a small, autonomous-only model that's intended for carrying small loads in tight urban areas. As indicated by the model names, Kia is also open to further PBV models to sit between the initial concepts in the future. All the models have what's called a \"dynamic hybrid\" modular body on top of their skateboard EV platform. This combines tubular steel and engineered polymers to reduce the amount of parts needed by 55%, Kia claims, with no reduction in rigidity. Lots of recycled materials are used in the construction of the PBVs, too.  Kia is also developing a range of fleet-management options, including over-the-air software updates, to help firms running a large number of PBVs. It's also developing a PBV Ecosystem, based around an integrated rail system on the ceiling, floor and side of the machines, that will allow items such as frames, cabinets and seats to be switched between different PBVs. Beyond the vehicles, Kia is further planning to integrate robotics and autonomous driving technology into the PBV ecosystem, so that the vehicles are ready for use in future ‘smart city’ environments. This would be in phase three.  Kia's van could be the cleverest around - but is there a market? George Barrow It’s hard not to look at the PV5 line-up with a healthy dose of scepticism but the requirements of the commercial vehicle industry are very different from those in the passenger car world. Advanced telematics, AI features, and even sustainable materials in the cabin simply aren’t on the agenda for your average Joe whose van is just another tool of their trade. In its current guise, the PV5 van is likely to sit roughly in the size and payload region of the Ford Transit Custom, the most successful van of the past decade. I have my doubts that an electric-only LCV will be able to gain traction in such a competitive market. The size seems irregular in a market where double-pallet loadspaces are important and many fleets struggle to effectively implement basic telematics in an effective way, let alone make use of future plans for autonomous vehicles and peer-to-peer payloads. The Volkswagen ID Buzz Cargo has already begun to change the way buyers look at EV-only vans, but a new name with no commercial vehicle pedigree and no dedicated commercial vehicle sales and back-up makes the PV5 concept seem more like LCV (or PBV) fiction, than fact. Kia doesn’t just need to invent a model, but also a market for what is currently a highly advanced digital proposition in a fairly analogue world. George Barrow is an International Van of the Year juror",

    "link": "https://www.bikeexif.com/mooneyes-streamliner-motorcycle",
    "description": "Most of us know Mooneyes as the brand behind Japan’s most prestigious custom motorcycle and car show. But the company’s history can be traced back to 1950s America, when its founder, Dean Moon, started making a name for himself in the Southern Californian hot rod scene. One of Moon’s most notable creations was the Mooneyes Streamliner. With an aesthetic somewhere between art deco and futuristic (for the 60s), the Streamliner was a land-speed racing car with aerodynamic bodywork and a bright yellow paint job. It was also the inspiration for this outlandish twin-engined Triumph drag bike, built by James Rogers in Gloucestershire, England. James is far from a typical custom motorcycle builder. He damp-proofs basements for a living, building custom bikes after hours as a creative outlet out of a single-car garage, armed with little more than a grinder, welder, and heaps of imagination.…",

    "description": "When it comes to Harley-Davidson design, the 1971 FX Super Glide is one of those bikes that people either love, or love to hate. It was Harley’s first attempt at a factory custom, mixing the sporty vibe of the XL series with the heavyweight punch of the FL models. But what really stole the show—for better or worse—was the boat tail seat. Bold, brash, and undeniably 1970s, it’s a design that’s as polarizing today as it was back then. From the Mind of Willie G. The idea for the FX Super Glide emerged during a transitional period for Harley-Davidson. The 1960s had been tough for the company, with increasing competition from British and Japanese manufacturers. Willie G. Davidson, grandson of one of the company’s founders, sought to reinvigorate the brand with a bike that appealed to the burgeoning custom culture.…",

    "description": "It has been a few months since you last read a Himalayan report, and I must take some of the blame. Between a prolonged period of illness and some intense travel, the bike hasn’t received the attention it should have. On top of this, it ended up being with RE for a couple of months when I sent it in to address some issues, and I didn’t push for it to be returned sooner. TFT is easy to read and legible even under harsh sunlight. The first of those issues was that the usually fiddly toggle switch for the display stopped working entirely and had to be replaced. I also wanted the company to permanently address the problem with the bike pulling to the right when the handlebar was released – something I’ve written about in the previous report. As I understand it, the second issue had something to do with rectifying various torque settings on bolts that connect the engine to the frame. The bike returned with working switchgear and the right-leaning problem almost entirely sorted out – it’s still marginally noticeable but no longer to a troubling extent. Switching modes on the Himalayan can be a task, given how often it’s denied. As soon as the Himalayan was back, I realised why I enjoyed it so much in the first place. Its big size, incredible suspension, and fantastic overall comfort are a class apart. But since this bike deserved some good running after such a long downtime, I gave it to Gavin for his ride down to IBW, and what you’ll read from hereon is his account. Our Himalayan is equipped with the optional touring seat, which was a boon on my nearly 1,200km ride to Goa and back. It was firm yet supportive and kept saddle soreness at bay for the majority of my journey. Thanks to its abundant mounting points, strapping a tail bag on is a piece of cake. A little more wind protection would have been nice, though. The carrier and grab rail make for perfect mounting points for all your luggage. My issues with the Himalayan are mostly nothing new. Despite being replaced, the switchgear is sometimes unresponsive. While this motor performs well, the high-speed vibrations can render your palms numb on long rides. The one quality issue is that the right mirror keeps coming loose, and its threads have now been damaged, meaning a new one will have to be purchased. Finally, the headlight offers adequate illumination, but most owners are better off getting auxiliary lights. The right mirror keeps coming loose, and the threading is now damaged.   Despite these shortcomings, the Himalayan is an excellent motorcycle with a handful of minor gripes. While I was fortunate not to have any punctures, the fear of one always looms over me. Thankfully, we will soon be getting a set of tubeless wheels installed. Before we end, our bike has developed the typical Himalayan loose steering cone set, and that’s something we’ll address in the next report.

    "description": "Few cars boast brand equity as strong as the Hyundai Creta. This formidable midsize SUV has long dominated its segment, thanks to its well-rounded packaging, feature-rich appeal and diverse powertrain options. Now, Hyundai has taken the winning Creta formula and electrified it, giving rise to the Creta Electric. The big question is if this battery-powered version can replicate the success of its internal combustion engine (ICE) counterpart. The Creta Electric is built on the ICE platform, but it has undergone significant reworking to accommodate its electric powertrain. The cabin floor sits slightly higher to make room for the battery pack, the suspension has been stiffened to handle the additional weight, and the front wheels are powered by an electric motor. Despite these changes, the Creta Electric retains the dimensions of its ICE sibling, including an impressive 200mm (unladen) ground clearance. An \"electric\" badge on the bootlid and pixelated accents on the bumper set this version apart from its ICE counterpart.   Hyundai Creta Electric exterior In terms of design, the Creta Electric takes inspiration from the Creta N Line, particularly at the front. The enclosed grille, featuring a pixelated theme reminiscent of the Ioniq 5, incorporates a centrally placed charging port. This pixelated motif extends to the closed front air dam, which includes active flaps to enhance aerodynamic efficiency. The 17-inch aero-style alloy wheels further emphasise its EV identity, and they come wrapped in lowrolling resistance, EV-specific tyres. Adding to its aesthetic appeal are silver highlights on the lower edges of the black plastic cladding, creating a striking contrast. Our dual-tone test unit featured black pillars, a black roof, and a black rear spoiler for added flair. Unique identifiers, such as an \"electric\" badge on the bootlid and pixelated accents on the rear bumper, set this version apart from its ICE counterpart. The sight of its battery pack beneath its body looks a bit ungainly, especially when viewed from the sides. Flaps on the front air dam automatically open and close to improve aerodynamic efficiency.   Hyundai Creta Electric interior Step into the Creta Electric’s cabin, and you’ll immediately notice its resemblance to the ICE version. However, several EV-specific upgrades make it distinct. A notable addition is the all-new three-spoke steering wheel with a circular horn boss, adorned with four dots symbolising the letter ‘H’ in Morse code. Interestingly, the steering buttons have been rearranged – the infotainment and phone controls are now on the right, while ADAS functions are on the left. New three-spoke steering wheel with a circular horn boss; four dots symbolise the letter ‘H’ in Morse code. The familiar 10.25-inch instrument cluster now features an additional cube-like theme, akin to the Ioniq 5. The air conditioning console – borrowed from the updated Alcazar – combines infotainment shortcuts with touch-sensitive keys, although practical physical toggles for temperature and a volume knob remain. A standout addition is the steering column-mounted drive selector, reminiscent of the Ioniq 5. This design frees up the centre console, which now adopts a floating style. It houses a drive mode button, an electric parking brake, an auto-hold button, ventilated front seat controls, and dual cupholders. Impressively, there’s a lower deck area beneath it which houses a fair bit of storage space. Even the armrest console is huge, and like the glovebox, it features a cooling vent to keep beverages cool. Lower deck area beneath the centre console houses a fair bit of storage space. In line with Hyundai’s sustainable focus, the seats are upholstered in eco-friendly materials derived from corn extracts and recycled plastic bottles. Surprisingly, the texture is smooth and closely resembles the leatherette used in the ICE model. The slightly higher floor impacts the driving position, which feels elevated even at its lowest setting. While rear seat space remains unchanged and is comfortable, the seating postureis slightly knees-up. A new boss-function allows rear passengers to electronically slide the front passenger seat forward, enhancing legroom. Utility trays on the front seatbacks include grooves for mobile devices and integrated pop-open cupholders for added convenience. You're seated in a slightly knees-up position, although it isn't uncomfortable. Additionally, the Creta Electric features a V2L (Vehicle-to-Load) system with a 3-pin power socket, enabling users to power devices like laptops or small appliances. Storage capacity remains practical with the unchanged 433-litre boot, complete with a spare tire under the boot floor. A 22-litre frunk provides extra loading space beneath the bonnet. 433-litre boot remains just as practical as the ICE version; gets a spare tyre beneath the floor, too.   Hyundai Creta Electric features Besides carrying forward the ICE version’s feature-set, the Electric gets some new equipment too, like rain-sensing wipers, electric front seats with driver’s seat memory, a cooling central console, boss seat function as well as front seatback-mounted utility trays. It carries forward the Autonomous Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) suite, which, like in the standard Creta, adds a safety net without feeling too intrusive in its function. Familiar 10.25-inch instrument cluster gets new cube-like display theme. Hyundai has invested heavily in developing an in-car payments option, which, with a mere touch, facilitates a wallet-based payment for vehicle charging, as well as future subscription-based features. In addition, the company has developed a first-of-its-kind mobile application through which users can not only identify and navigate to over 10,000 EV chargers across different brands but also make payments via the app to certain service providers. This eliminates the hassle of downloading and registering on multiple brand-specific applications. We’re still sore that like the standard Creta, it misses out on things like wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, adjustable front armrest, a headrest for the middle rear passenger, and the volume of its 8-speaker Bose setup is much lower at the rear than in the front. Also, compared to the large screens of its competitors, the Creta Electric’s 10.25-inch touchscreen comes across as a bit small. A new boss-function allows rear passengers to electronically slide the front passenger seat forward, enhancing legroom.   Hyundai Creta Electric performance The Creta Electric is offered with two battery options: a 42kWh pack and a 51.4kWh Long Range pack. Both utilise Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) cell chemistry, similar to the Ioniq 5. This type of battery is more compact and energy-dense than Lithium Ferrous Phosphate (LFP) batteries, although LFP batteries are known for their longer lifespan. For added peace of mind, Hyundai offers an 8-year/1,60,000km warranty on the battery, alongside the standard 3-year warranty on the car. The sight of its battery pack from the side looks a bit ungainly. Powering the Creta Electric is a single motor on the front axle that drives the front wheels. In the Long Range variant, this motor produces 171hp and 255Nm. Interestingly, its torque matches the diesel variant's 250Nm and is close to the turbo-petrol's 260Nm. However, being an EV, the power delivery is strong yet exceptionally linear. Acceleration feels brisk and effortless, even in its most efficient ‘Eco’ mode. The three drive modes – Eco, Normal and Sports – deliver noticeably different responses to part-throttle inputs, while flooring the accelerator unleashes the motor’s full potential. A synthesised bassy hum under hard acceleration adds a touch of drama to the otherwise silent drive. In our tests, the Creta Electric managed a 0-100kph time of 8.2 seconds, slightly behind the claimed 7.9 seconds. Flat out, it can achieve a top speed of 180kph. Acceleration feels brisk and effortless, but real-world range of over 400km impresses. The Creta gets a total of five regenerative braking options, with Level 1, 2 and 3 adjusting deceleration and bringing the car to a crawl.While these modes are mild, Levels 4 and 5 are strong. Drivers can also disable regenerative braking entirely for a free-rolling experience or opt for the ‘i-Pedal’ mode, which allows one-pedal driving by bringing the car to a complete stop without using the brake pedal. Each mode feels distinct and natural, making them intuitive to use. Adaptive cruise control integrates seamlessly with the regen system, adjusting braking automatically based on the situation, though drivers can override this using steering-mounted paddle shifters. Hyundai Creta Electric range and charging The 42kWh battery variant has an ARAI-certified range of 390km, while the 51.4kWh Long Range version offers 473km. In a mixed driving cycle of city and highway conditions, our preliminary test of the Long Range variant returned an impressive real-world range of approximately 426km. For reference, our 289.6km drive at an average speed of 41kph toggling through different drive and regenerative braking settings, utilised 68 percent of the charge. Charging port behind the enclosed front grille gets an LED indicator. Hyundai claims the battery can be charged from 10 to 80 percent in just 58 minutes using a 50kW DC fast charger. With a 11kW AC charger, the larger battery charges fully (10 to 100 percent) in 4 hours and 50 minutes, while the smaller battery completes this in 4 hours. Hyundai Creta Electric ride and handling To support the additional weight of the battery and motor, the Creta Electric’s suspension is stiffer than the ICE version’s. Remarkably, it doesn’t translate into a crashy or uncomfortable ride experience. Yes, you can feel its firmness at low speeds, and you’ll also hear its suspension ‘thwack’ over sharp bumps (particularly due to an otherwise silent cabin), but road shocks are still well in check. What’s nice is that the stiffness has eliminated unnecessary (secondary) body movements, and even at highway speeds, the Creta Electric doesn’t lose its poise. The steering, too, is noticeably heavier than the ICE version’s, and as a result, it warrants more effort at slow and parking speeds. But at no point does it feel excessive or cumbersome. And while it hasn’t resulted in more feel or feedback per se, the added weight only adds to the driver’s confidence, especially at high speeds or around a series of bends. Also nice is that the Creta Electric changes directions well, and with its weight being concentrated lower down, body roll seems to be far better controlled than the petrol-version. Notably, the Electric’s braking is so good, the transition from regenerative to frictional brakes feels extremely smooth and superbly calibrated, thus lending to a very natural brake pedal feel. Hyundai Creta Electric verdict The Creta Electric has its flaws – the ride is stiffer than the ICE version’s; the steering is a bit weighty; and finally, its floor is a bit raised, which results in a slightly knees-up position. But none of these are a dealbreaker. A standout addition is the steering column-mounted drive selector, akin to the Ioniq 5. The Electric version still retains the ICE’s brilliant packaging like its spacious cabin, ample practicality, and a decently sized boot – it gets a frontal loading area (frunk), too. Performance is smooth, linear and reasonably quick. But what’s even more impressive is its real-world range of over 400km, with reasonable charging times. And even though its suspension is firmer than the ICE Creta’s, it gets a newfound confidence in the ride and handling department. Typical to the Creta’s proposition, this electric iteration is feature-rich, too. At a price ranging between Rs 18 lakh and Rs 23.50 lakh, the Creta Electric comes across as a fantastic EV. Will it replicate the ICE's success? If first impressions are anything to go by, the Creta Electric seems to have what it takes to dominate the EV space.

    "description": "The attraction to automobiles does not always pertain entirely to a physical quality. Sure, a car’s design, or its smell, or its sound can be part of that attraction, but a bigger part lies within something more abstract. If there was ever anyone who could relate to such an emotion, it would be Rob Simon. His steed of choice has been, and always will be, the legendary BMW E30 M3. In the automotive space, the legendary Bavarian warrior needs no introduction or backstory.
