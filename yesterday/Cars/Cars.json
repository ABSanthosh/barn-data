    "description": "This 1958 Lancia Aurelia B24S is one of 521 convertibles built during three years of production and was purchased in 1976 by Dr. Raymond Boniface, who retained it as part of his Italian car collection until his 2020 passing. Chassis 1502 was then purchased by a collector in Italy who in turn sold it to its current owner. Finished in ivory over red leather, the car is powered by a 2,451cc V6 that breathes through a single Weber carburetor and is paired with a replacement four-speed manual transaxle. Additional equipment includes sliding-pillar front suspension, a De Dion rear axle, a removable hardtop finished in black, and a black convertible top. A Lion Award winner at the 2016 Concours d’Elegance of America, this B24S was listed on BaT in December 2024 and is now offered on dealer consignment in Bari, Italy, with a tool kit and Italian registration that lists the car as a 1959 model.",

    "description": "Viaterra’s Second Skin is a base layer designed for motorcycle riding in hot weather, where the aim is to wick the sweat and moisture away from the body to help keep it cool.  As the name suggests, this is meant to be the first layer you wear under your riding jacket, and it’s designed to be as comfortable as possible. The material is nice and stretchy, and Viaterra has taken care to design the seams to be as unobtrusive as possible. The seams are quite flat, and they all have a piping of soft material around them to reduce chafing against the skin. The result of all this is that comfort is very good, and you’ll be happy wearing this for long days on the bike. What I did notice is that it’s not a high-compression fit like some of the more performance-oriented products out there. You can try a size smaller, but the sleeves might end up being too short. Ultimately, this isn’t a super snug, body-hugging fit, and I found myself preferring to use the Viaterra Second Skin for more relaxed, touring sort of riding rather than high-intensity track or off-road riding, where a compression fit is nicer. Polygiene tech helps keep odour build-up under control. One area where the Second Skin has fared well so far is in odour management. I have found that some base layers can retain odour even after a machine wash, and that hasn’t been an issue here so far. The company uses Polygiene technology, which is a silica-based solution that captures and removes odours from the material. The Second Skin is available in six sizes, and you have a choice of five subtle colours, including a couple of interesting-looking camo-style prints. There’s also a choice of lower base layers in the same material. Both the top and bottom are available for Rs 1,499 each, which is on par with the competition and a fair amount to pay.

    "description": "British entry is the only Le Mans Hypercar based on a road-going model and the only one with a twelve cylinders Aston Martin has revealed the race car with which it will aim for its first overall victory in the Le Mans 24 Hours in more than 60 years. Based on the road-going Valkyrie, it has been developed to the Le Mans Hypercar (LMH) rulebook, which allows entrants to use a higher proportion of bespoke content than the Le Mans Daytona Hybrid (LMDh) alternative. It will be the only car in the top flight of endurance racing to be powered by a V12 engine; all other competitors use either a V8 or a V6. It will also be one of just two naturally aspirated engines in the class, joining the V8 of the Cadillac V-Series R. The Valkyrie’s hybridised 6.5-litre Cosworth V12 has, however, been redeveloped to better suit endurance racing.  It's detuned from 1140bhp down to the 680bhp mandated by the rulebook and Aston Martin has fettled it to produce a more even spread of torque through the rev range.  Moreover, the rev limit has been reduced and the air-fuel ratio made leaner to improve efficiency and therefore require less fuel (and thus less weight) on board between pit stops. Meanwhile, the Valkyrie’s bodywork has been redesigned to allow any damaged components to be removed and replaced more quickly, as well as for better aerodynamic performance – sprouting a prominent rear fin. A pneumatic jack system has been added to the chassis to speed up tyre changes. The car will be entered into this year’s FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) and the US-based IMSA Sportscar Championship. At Le Mans, the flagship car – numbered 007 – will be piloted by Brits Harry Tincknell and Tom Gamble. Danish driver Marco Sørensen and Spaniard Alex Riberas will take charge of the #009 entry. The cars will be run by The Heart of Racing, the team that's currently responsible for Aston Martin’s efforts in the lesser GT3 class.",

    "title": "First electric Ferrari to be revealed on 9 October",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/first-electric-ferrari-be-revealed-9-october",
    "description": "The EV will be revealed late this year before going on sale in 2026 Ferrari's CEO said the firm will unwrap its future at its Capital Markets Day, hinting at debut for EV Ferrari is set to reveal its long-awaited debut electric car on 9 October. In an announcement accompanying the Italian firm's 2024 financial figures, CEO Benedetto Vigna said Ferrari will \"reveal more of our future on 9 October at our Capital Markets Day\". He stopped short of confirming any more details, but said it would be presented \"in a unique and innovative way\".  That will be a year since Ferrari revealed its new F80 halo hypercar, which is due to begin deliveries around autumn 2025 - so it promises to be a particularly busy period in Maranello. Ferrari is also expected to reveal follow-ups to the Roma and SF90 Stradale this year, though has not said whether these will form part of the Capital Markets Day announcements.   Overall, Vigna said the firm will roll out six new cars in 2025. Vigna said the firm expects \"further robust growth\" this year in the run-up to that date, following a year in which Ferrari significantly increased revenues and profits. Although car deliveries were up just 0.7% year-on-year in 2024, at 13,752 units, Ferrari posted a revenue uptick of 12% – to €6.7bn – of which €1.53bn was profit, a 21% increase.  Vigna attributed the hikes to \"quality of revenues over volumes\", highlighting the impact of a \"strong product mix and a growing demand for personalisations\".  Production of the Portofino M, SF90 Stradale, 812 and Roma was phased out during 2024, to allow Ferrari to ramp up output of the Purosangue, Roma Spider, 296 GTS, SF90 XX and 12Cilindri. The 296 and SF90 hybrid model lines accounted for 51% of Ferrari's total shipments. Deliveries of the ultra-exclusive Daytona SP3 and 499P Modificata specials helped to \"enrich\" the product mix, Ferrari said, along with customers more extensively personalising their cars. Vigna recently told Autocar that Ferrari’s first electric car has already completed several thousand miles of on-road testing and promised it will be made “in the right way” to ensure buyers can “have a lot of fun”. The Italian firm has yet to give any details about what form its first battery-electric vehicle will take, but recent spy shots show what are understood to be test mules using modified Maserati Levante bodywork. Whether it will be obviously comparable with the Levante in silhouette remains to be seen. Notably, though, Ferrari used Maserati’s SUV as the basis for the first Purosangue prototypes and that car is radically different from its Italian contemporary – while still sitting high off the ground and having rear seats. It is possible Ferrari could seek to emulate the characteristic dynamic qualities of its combustion cars by centralising the mass of the batteries in the chassis – much in the way that its current cars are either front-mid-engined or rear-mid-engined. Vigna said he expects the new EV to appeal to both existing Ferrari customers and tech-savvy newcomers to the brand. He added: “There is not a pattern really. People buy a Ferrari because when they buy a Ferrari, they have a lot of fun. They don’t buy a Ferrari because A, B, C, D or a single element. It’s a combination of things. When we do electric cars, we will produce them in the right way. “Consider that we have prototypes already on the road that have done several thousand kilometres, and we have in our company very qualified clients: test drivers. The first clients of our cars are the test drivers. They drive a lot of cars, and they can easily make a comparison between one and another, so for us this is an important metric that we are making a reference to.” Reports from Reuters have suggested that the new EV will be priced from $500,000 (£395,000) and claimed that a second electric model is already under development. Vigna called those reports “a surprise” and declined to confirm any of those details. He added: “The way we define the price of a car is one month before we launch it.” The Ferrari EV will be produced in the firm’s new E-building, which has recently been opened on its Maranello campus. The facility contains an advanced new production line, which is likely to start operations with the Purosangue and SF90 before the EV joins in 2026. The new production line will not replace either of Ferrari’s two existing lines, but the firm refused to be drawn on whether it will increase capacity. Vigna said Ferrari will offer internal combustion, hybrid and electric models in the future but insisted that the sales split between those models will not be set by sales or production targets but by customer demand. “We always refer to what is our offer, not ‘what are the sales?’” said Vigna. “Forecasting the sales by the kind of propulsion is an act of arrogance, a lack of respect to the client. We will never talk about sales splits. “How can we understand what the client wants? We’re not talking about computers selecting a car. We’re talking about human beings with emotion.” The E-building will help Ferrari reduce development times and increase the level of personalisation that it can offer, which is key to the company’s goal of increasing “revenue quality over quantity”. It will also eventually house production of all of Ferrari’s powertrains, including high-voltage batteries, electric motors and axles that will be used for its future electric models. Bringing production of those key electric components in-house is vital to the firm’s ambitions to ensure that its electric models have points of difference from rivals and that it can continue to service all its models in the future. Ferrari will buy its battery cells from a number of unspecified providers. Vigna declined to give any information about which firms it will use but did drop a hint about battery technology. He said: “You hear people in the market going for LFP [lithiumiron-phosphate] batteries. Well, LFP batteries are not for Ferrari. It’s not good for us.”",

    "description": "More than the surprise India debut of this long-wheelbase iX1 at Auto Expo 2025, it was the price it was launched at that caught us all off guard. We’ve been conditioned to believe that EVs must be more expensive than their ICE counterparts; call it a technology tax, if you will. But, at Rs 49 lakh (ex-showroom, India), the iX1 LWB costs Rs 1.8 lakh less than the petrol X1 (as well as all its EV rivals), while delivering much greater room in the back seat. The price is for the first six months of production only, and is the result of local assembly, this being the first BMW EV to be brought in as a CKD. BMW iX1 LWB exterior To the uninitiated, it’s hard to spot the extra 116mm of length at first glance, but to those familiar with the standard model, the stretch is immediately evident. The good news is it doesn’t look ungainly like, say, the 5 Series did after its stretch. In fact, where the standard iX1 looks just a little comical with its exaggerated headlamps, tail-lamps and grille, you don’t get as much of that sensation with this larger vehicle, and to these eyes, the proportions are better. Exaggerated headlamps and grille look more proportional in the LWB model. It’s a shame the wheels didn’t move up a size from the 18 inchers of the previous version; in fact, even their design is the same, and they look a little lost in the large, square wheel arches. 108mm of that increased length is in the wheelbase (now up to 2,800mm), and in case you’re worried about how this affects its speed breaker-crossing ability, BMW assures us the laden ground clearance is around 175mm, which means it’s closer to 190mm unladen. 18-inch wheels look a bit small on the LWB version. Increased length aside, it’s visually identical to the short-wheelbase iX1, even retaining its M Sport styling kit. This gives some requisite attitude to what is no longer a compact vehicle in any sense, and saves it from looking too slab sided. Yes, some of the details might still polarise – tail-lamps and grille especially – but there’s no doubt it looks striking. BMW iX1 LWB interior and features As you might imagine, the lengthening of the iX1 has all gone into the rear of the cabin, and the legroom here is just vast. As before, you’re sat low to the floor in a knees-up position, thanks to the battery, but it doesn’t bother you as much since you have so much more horizontal space to stretch out. It’s also because the seat base has been lengthened by 15mm and softer cushioning has been used throughout, making the seat subtly more comfortable. The backrest can even be reclined up to 28.5 degrees. Huge space at the rear now and seat comfort has improved too. All this makes for a more comfortable chauffeur-driven experience, with space that’s far superior to anything else in the segment. Enhancing the sense of space here is a larger glass area in the form of a bigger panoramic sunroof (now a fixed glass, rather than an openable one) and, naturally, longer windows. However, much like in the 5 Series, the iX1 misses out on rear window blinds, which would have been a worthwhile addition in the LWB version. Dash design is quirky and surprisingly practical. Other spec differences include the removal of the beige upholstery colour; mocha brown is your only option now, and some features that have been removed. Among these are the ‘boost’ paddle behind the wheel which would get you 10sec of extra torque, and the massage function for the front seats. Other features, meanwhile, are there, but for a price, as BMW is offering them as options or subscriptions, including onboard navigation, certain drive modes and even the spare wheel! BMW iX1 LWB performance and range It’s not just features that have been removed, though; the iX1 has ditched its rear motor and now uses a front-wheel-drive setup rather than AWD. With this new sDrive20 powertrain has come a drop in power from 313hp to 204hp, and torque from 494Nm to 250Nm. Naturally, that’s resulted in a dip in performance, with the 0-100kph acceleration times dropping from 5.49sec to 8.31sec, but with the same 66.4kWh battery, BMW’s certified range figure has jumped from 440km to 531km. However, in our short time with the car, we couldn’t do a real-world range test.  It uses the same 66.4kWh battery, but ditches the real axle motor from the SWB model. What we could verify was the performance, which feels noticeably subdued, and not just in comparison to the old xDrive30 version. 200hp sounds like a lot, but this is a larger and heavier vehicle, and during overtakes especially you feel wanting for power, or at the very least that EV-typical instantaneous punch. It definitely has that ‘entry level engine’ vibe about it, and once you make your peace with that and factor in the greater range, the trade-off seems fair. Some of X1's agility has been lost with the added length. The longer wheelbase has brought a more laidback demeanour to the handling too, and combined with the relaxed power delivery, you’re not inclined to push this car as you might have the xDrive30. What’s remained is the excellent ride quality, which is a trait BMW has lately stolen from arch rival Mercedes. Apart from an at-times hollow-sounding thunk on sharp bumps, the suspension is absorbent and even maintains good body composure. BMW iX1 LWB price and verdict The front half of the cabin hasn’t changed, for better or worse. This includes the quirky but practical dash and centre console, the hit-or-miss interior quality, and the frustratingly complex i-Drive 9 touchscreen which has swallowed up too many functions (here’s where Merc has stolen a march on BMW). But these are problems for your driver, as the focus with the iX1 LWB is the rear seat. BMW says the car was borne from two factors – buyers’ complaints that entry-level luxury cars felt too cramped for their asking price, and that while market leader Mercedes has a stranglehold on the top end of the market, the bottom end was there for the taking. Think if the iX1 LWB as a sister car to the 3 Series Gran Limousine, and it starts to make sense. It isn't just cheaper than its rivals; it's cheaper than its own SWB petrol counterpart, too. This car, then, is a statement of intent from the Bavarian brand, a flag to mark its territory. And if the combination of superb rear-seat space and a knockout price of Rs 49 lakh (ex-showroom, India) entice enough buyers, it might just be what can jump-start the waning entry luxury segment.

    "description": "One of Honda’s most enduring motorcycles is also one of its most incognito. The Honda CG125—a petite single-cylinder commuter—has been in constant production since 1976, winning hearts and minds through its durability and affordability. Even though it’s no longer in production in Japan, it lives on in countries like Pakistan, Brazil, and China, manufactured by various Honda subsidiaries and partners. This peppy Honda CG125 is a Chinese-made model, built under the Wuyang-Honda label. It’s been masterfully tweaked by Jesse Liu of Kicker Garage, influenced by the popular brat style established by the legendary Go Takamine. The delightful simplicity of Kicker’s CG125 belies the amount of work that Jesse has poured into it. Through a host of subtle, yet well judged, changes, he’s turned the humble commuter bike into a handsome café hopper.…",

    "description": "Import duties on new cars and SUVs priced above USD 40,000 sees no change despite changes in duty structure that was announced in Budget 2025. However, there has been a reduction in the effective duty on motorcycles. Basic Customs Duty reduced from 125 percent to 70 percent  Additional 40 percent agricultural cess has been added  10 percent Social Welfare Surcharge completely removed  In this year’s Union Budget 2025, the BCD (Basic Customs duty) on cars costing more than USD 40,000 has been reduced to 70 percent from 125 percent earlier. Also, the import of these cars has been exempted from the SWS (Social Welfare Surcharge), which was 10 percent. While this should bring some positive cheer to new car buyers, it actually doesn’t, thanks to the Government of India introducing AIDC (Agriculture and Development Cess) to the duty structure, thus negating the benefits of exemption of SWS. AIDC was first proposed in the Union Budget a few years back to improve agricultural infrastructure. On the customs side, AIDC was initially applied on items such as gold, silver, alcohol beverages and crude palm oil. Previously, there was no AIDC on vehicles, but now, AIDC must be factored in when calculating the effective duty rate.  This shift in taxation can be seen as a structural change to increase the central government's revenue. BCD is shared between the centre and state governments. However, the AIDC is a central government levy, which goes exclusively to the centre. Meanwhile, there has been a reduction in the effective duty on motorcycles. The BCD on the import of motorcycles, including complete built units (CBUs), semi-knocked down (SKD) and completely knocked down (CKD) units, has been cut. Also, the AIDC has not been introduced on the import of motorcycles, unlike in the case of cars. Also See: Budget 2025: EV battery, components production incentivised",

    "description": "The first month of 2025 saw a growth in sales for the top six Indian 2-wheeler brands after a rather slow December. Let’s see how each of them fared. Hero MotoCorp : 4,12,378 units Hero MotoCorp has retained its position at the top, despite experiencing a 2 percent decline compared to the previous year. In comparison to a slow December 2024 (2,94,152 units), Hero has witnessed a colossal 40.1 percent (4,12,378 units) of growth in January 2025 sales. The company has also made a number of launches at the 2025 edition of Bharat Mobility Global Expo such as the updated Xpulse 210, Xoom 160, Xoom 125 and the new Hero Xtreme 250R. Honda : 4,02,977 units Hero's main competitor, Honda, is closing the gap. The company recorded an impressive 48.7 percent growth in January 2025 sales, reaching 4,02,977 units compared to the slower year-end figures of 2,70,919 units. Honda now trails behind Hero by fewer than 9,500 units. Honda also launched a range of new two-wheelers, including the updated and reintroduced middleweight duo, the Honda CBR650R and CB650R. Additionally, it made its debut into the electric scooter market with the launch of the Activa e: and QC1. TVS : 2,93,860 units TVS has maintained its third spot in the pyramid. Even though it has witnessed a growth of 36 percent (2,93,860 units), It is behind the top two contenders by a considerable gap. There’s a 5 percent growth compared to the previous year (2,68,233 units). TVS recently launched a brand new engine, the RTX-D4 at the 4th edition of its TVS MotoSoul. It will be launching an adventure motorcycle based on this engine, later this year. The brand even showcased its first CNG powered scooter, the Jupiter CNG. Bajaj : 1,71,299 units Bajaj has seen a positive growth of over 33 percent (1,71,299 units) as compared to the previous month (1,28,335 units) but in comparison to the same period in previous year (1,93,350 units), its sales have plummeted by 11 percent. It is pertinent to note that these figures also include its best seller EV model, the Chetak EV which recently dethroned the long standing OLA S1 from its top spot. Bajaj had also introduced the world’s first CNG 2-wheeler, Freedom 125 which has also garnered good sales numbers over the months. Suzuki : 87,834 units This Japanese manufacturer witnessed a growth of over 11.4 percent (87,834 units) as compared to the previous month. It even reported a positive 9 percent (80,511 units) in comparison to January 2024. Suzuki also made its presence felt at the 2025 Auto Expo by launching the Suzuki SF 250 flex fuel and the E-Access alongside the updated Access 125. Royal Enfield : 81,052 units Crossing the 80,000 units mark in the first month of 2025, this Chennai based brand reported a growth of over 19 percent over the previous month (67,891 units). Compared to the previous year, Royal Enfield witnessed a steady growth of over 14 percent (70,556 units). The brand recently launched its new Scram 440 which was showcased back in November 2024.

    "title": "GLORY RESTORED: Chasing the Alpine Dream",
    "link": "",
    "description": "https://youtu.be/2TdYfbosJhc In Stuttgart, two brands are king: Porsche and Mercedes. Their presence is ubiquitous, paved into the roads, the culture, and the very identity of the region. If you grew up there, you were supposed to pick a side and pledge allegiance to one of the two. Jürgen Claus grew up in Stuttgart but didn’t adhere to that conventional German wisdom. Something else had earned his attention. In flashes, glimpses, and a few stolen frames of life during rides on his bike, he would spot a car. It would streak past, barely there, and then gone, but each time, it gave Jürgen something to dream about. Before it was a legend, before it was the car that toppled giants, the A110 was a newly fleshed curiosity. The Alpine was born in Dieppe, France, in the early 1960s as Jean Rédélé’s vision of a “weight is king” sports car built for agility over brute force. He saw weight as the real enemy, believing that the right balance of power, size, handling, and simplicity would create something truly special. What the world ended up with was a fiberglass-bodied, rear-engined scalpel of a car, built on Renault underpinnings. It was compact, delicate looking, and deceptively quick. The A110 would eventually thrive where muscle cars faltered, becoming a Rally tool that affixed its name onto motorsport history. It won everywhere, on the Monte Carlo stages, in the Alps, on gravel, on tarmac. It was light, agile, and utterly unforgiving. In 1973, when the World Rally Championship was officially founded, it was the Alpine A110 that took the very first title, proving that more horsepower wasn’t always better. Other lightweight pioneers like the Lancia Stratos may never have been penned if it wasn’t for the A110. Jürgen’s search for his A110 took him deep into the unknown, pulling threads on rumors and whispers. Finding a regular Alpine in decent condition isn’t easy. Finding a works race car? Almost impossible. The world is full of lookalikes, tributes, and fiberglass imposters. True competition built A110s are ghosts. He eventually caught wind of a car that had supposedly been sold in Hungary, a real Alpine with real pedigree. There were no documents, no clear paper trail, just a lead. He did what anyone with an obsession this deep would do. He packed a backpack full of cash and hit the road. No guarantees, no promises.  Beneath layers of questionable modifications, spoilers, turbochargers, intercoolers, there was something unmistakable. The plaques in the front trunk were still original. On them, the chassis number revealed the truth. The car was real. It didn’t matter that it looked nothing like it should. It didn’t matter that it would take years of work to bring it back. He wasn’t leaving without it. Jürgen spent years undoing the damage. Hours turned into weeks and weeks turned into months. Sanding, welding, reshaping... dreaming. Obsessing. There were no blueprints, no factory records with detailed specs. The A110 wasn’t built with the obsessive precision of a Stuttgart engineer. It was built by French hands, refined through trial and error. Every reinforcement, every brace, every tweak was added as needed. Problems were solved on the spot, one by one with little documentation to follow. There were only 17 genuine versions of this car ever built, and that is in 1973. How many still existed? Just a handful of originals bobbing in  a sea of replicas. Waiting to be discovered, and restored. “My name is Jürgen Claus,” he says, “and I fell in love with a queen. The queen of rallies.”   Continue...",

    "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJDrjdXmFeI Dave will be the first one to tell you his ’67 Shelby GT350 isn’t period correct. But when it comes to ticking the boxes of what truly matters, concours rules don’t even make the list. This car is more than a restoration; it’s the embodiment of perseverance, sacrifice, and a vision he held onto for decades. As a teenager, Dave watched the GT350 roll past his gas station, driven by a Vietnam veteran who had bought it brand new. To Dave, it wasn’t just a car; it was a rolling symbol of freedom and individuality. He knew, deep down, it would be his someday. That day came in 1973 when, after a few changes of ownership, he finally made the dream a reality. As it inevitably tends to do, life came by and happened. Marriage, family, and the responsibilities of adulthood meant the GT350 got pushed off to the back of his mind. Still, Dave never let go of the vision he had when he disassembled the car in 1976. Thirty years later, with his family’s support, he finally turned his attention back to the car, not to build a concours queen but to create something deeply personal.  “This car is not necessarily period correct.” Dave says, “It's not a concours car, but it's a hell of a machine because I built it the way I want it.” It took two years of bodywork, engine rebuilds, and assembly. He meticulously archived every bolt and part, documenting every detail as he blended authentic elements with personal touches to craft a machine that fulfills the longing he felt all those years ago watching it cruise by the station. Plenty of people want a factory-spec restoration, a polished time capsule built to live on manicured grass instead of asphalt. Instead Dave built something that embodies everything he values most: hard work, sacrifice, family, and the passion to see something through, no matter how long it takes. It’s not correct by concours standards, but it’s real by every measure that counts. For Dave, that’s all it ever needed to be. Continue...",
