    "description": "It’s been nearly a year since I got my hands on RS Taichi’s waterproof backpack, which is available in five colours and a unique Resident Evil edition. I’ve gone for the plain black shade due to its stealthy look and was quite eager to see just how usable this bag would be during monsoon. The WP backpack’s construction mainly comprises polyester and thermoplastic polyurethane. The bag consists of a primary 25-litre waterproof compartment, a smaller compartment located near the primary compartment’s opening and an external quick-access pocket that isn’t waterproof. Main compartment holds 25L. The bag uses a roll-up top system to seal the main compartment and can be adjusted based on how full it gets. It’s easy to use and even includes a Velcro strap to keep it tightly sealed. Its 25-litre storage is a boon for when I’m travelling, and over time, I’ve fit huge items in this compartment, including Rishaad’s fully packed Kriega R25 backpack! Secondary compartment is handy storage for small items The secondary compartment is only water-resistant, even though it uses the same opening as the main compartment. It can be used for smaller items, such as a pair of gloves, balaclavas and cleaning cloths. The third external pocket is mainly designed for items you’d like to keep handy that aren’t fazed by the rain, like a set of keys. Outer pocket is not waterproof. This bag gets a chest harness and a waist belt; both of these can be further adjusted to your size and do a good job of preventing the straps from slipping off the shoulders and distributing luggage weight evenly, especially when on the bike. Chest harness divides the load and provides a better fit. The overall fit, finish and feel of this bag are premium, and it feels built to last. However, after all this time, I did lose the rubberised end on the zipper pull tab located on the external pocket. Honestly, this is quite a minor issue and can be easily replaced. I’ve had absolutely no complaints with this bag otherwise. It’s been quite handy and dependable through my daily commute during peak Mumbai monsoon. Waist harness helps keep the bag secure while riding. Given that this bag is waterproof, you are prone to wearing it outside your protective rain gear, which can make it susceptible to dirt and grime being flung on it by the rear wheel. In such cases, a quick wipe-down with a wet cloth helps, and fortunately, the bag doesn’t stain permanently. This bag is currently available on special order at 6kiom.com and will cost approximately Rs 15,000. Velcro strap help seat the two main compartments well. I managed to buy it for far less overseas, and you may also have to wait anywhere from one to four months for it to be delivered. Just like most imported products, the RS Taichi WP backpack comes at a price, but it gives you good quality and performance in return. Also see: Ixon Dirt Air gloves review",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/audi-q6-gains-sportback-version-408-miles-range",
    "description": "Line-up spans two sizes of battery and a choice of four powertrains New coupé-SUV is more aerodynamic – and £2500 more expensive – than the regular Q6 The Audi Q6 E-tron has gained a Sportback variant with a more rakish rear end that increases the car’s maximum driving range. The sloping roofline of the new Q6 E-tron Sportback is said to be inspired by that of the Mk1 Audi TT, with an aggressive-looking rake flowing into a small spoiler. This improves the SUV’s drag coefficient from 0.28 to 0.26, which boosts the range of the longest-legged Performance model by 15 miles to 408 miles between charges. The more acute slope does, however, reduce the Sportback’s boot capacity to 511 litres from the 526 litres available in the existing Q6 E-tron model. A choice of four powertrains and two batteries will be offered on the Q6 Sportback SUV. The entry-level model gets a 75.8kWh (usable capacity) pack and a single motor that can send up to 248bhp through the rear wheels. The combo yields a range of 339 miles and a 0-62mph time of 7.0sec and the battery can be recharged at up to 225kW. The Q6 Sportback Performance gets a larger, 94.9kWh (usable) battery and a more powerful, 302bhp motor. As a result, its range is boosted to 408 miles and its 0-62mph time drops to 6.6sec. The pack can be recharged at 260kW. A four-wheel-drive Quattro version is available with the same battery and an additional front motor, increasing the car’s total power output to 382bhp. That allows it to dispatch 0-62mph in 5.9sec. The line-up is topped by the SQ6 Sportback, which sends a combined 482bhp to all four wheels. This performance SUV flagship is capable of hitting 62mph in 4.3sec, although its range is reduced to 377 miles. The two four-wheel-drive Audi Q6 Sportbacks can be recharged at 270kW. Inside, the car mirrors the Q6 SUV, with an 11.9in digital instrument display and a 14.5in infotainment touchscreen. A 10.9in passenger screen can be fitted as an optional extra. UK deliveries will begin in April, with prices starting from £62,475 – £2500 more than the equivalent version of the regular Q6. The range-topping SQ6 Sportback costs £95,450.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/from-the-archive/rifles-roadsters-fascinating-story-i-pace-maker-magna",
    "description": "Magna Steyr is an unknown outside the industry but has been trusted by some of the world’s most respected car makers Last week, we eulogised the I-Pace, production of which will soon end – in Austria, not the UK. That’s because it’s built for Jaguar by Magna Steyr, a company that is unknown outside the industry yet is a multibillion-dollar giant that has been trusted by some of the world’s most respected car makers. How did this come to be? Well, we must follow three distinct threads. Thread one takes us right back to 1830, when Leopold Werndl began manufacturing rifle parts in Steyr, Austria. Having expanded greatly during World War I, his firm decided to diversify, poached the famously convention-breaking engineer Hans Ledwinka from Tatra and in 1920 launched an affordable car of its own design. Autocar got its first taste of a Steyr car in 1925, remarking of the Type VII straight-six saloon: “It is apparent that the chassis is of very modern design, and the nature of the factory is sufficient indication of the class of workmanship to be expected. Performance is distinctly good, especially considering its capacity and weight of [1880kg]. For the suspension system, nothing but praise is due.” Thread two begins in 1890, when Johann Puch opened a bicycle workshop in Graz. Success came quickly, and by 1904 his business had expanded into cars, ranging from little ‘voiturettes’ to limousines for Austria’s Habsburg royal family. We pick up thread three in 1899, as Germany’s flourishing Daimler company established a subsidiary in Vienna. Austro Daimler made a variety of vehicles – including early 4x4s, military vehicles and even trains but primarily cars – under a certain Ferdinand Porsche. So fine were its luxury cars that they were permitted to bear the royal eagle, while its racers were world-beating. Autocar first tested an ‘AD’ in 1925, saying of the 19/70hp sports tourer: “The performance will not disappoint any motorist who will reflect that in this chassis of [3.4m] wheelbase there is a power unit of but a little over 2.5 litres capacity [and weight is 1500kg]. As a clutch stop is fitted, rapid upward changes on a hill can be effected with ease. Moreover, the controls are well placed, and the car handles in that delightful manner which engenders confidence in a driver strange to it.”  Our threads become tied together as Europe plunged into the Great Depression. First, in 1928, Puch, listless after the unexpected death of its founder, merged with Austro Daimler, which had recently lost Dr Porsche to Steyr – which then had to be bailed out just a year later, as its car sales collapsed from 5000 to a mere 13 (yes, 13) in 1930, then be bought out by its compatriots in 1935. Thus we now have one conglomerate, named Steyr-Daimler-Puch. World War II forced a sudden switch in tack, the Austrian factories making guns and Porsche-designed V8 trucks for the Nazi military. Trucks continued to be the focus after the war, along with buses and tractors, but the firm didn’t want to abandon cars, so it signed a deal to produce modified Fiat designs from 1948. Most significant among them was the tiny, super-affordable 500 that got Italy moving post-war, and the Austrians did some cool sporting versions too, as Autocar found out in 1967 in the Steyr-Puch 650 TRII, which had just claimed a shock European Rally Championship title. “Its remarkable 650cc air-cooled flat twin, which develops an amazing 36bhp, sounds sweet, very healthy and eager to go on being thrashed.” As for the military machinery, we found of the lightweight Haflinger 4x4 “the worse the conditions, the more the car impresses” and of the later, larger, 6x6 Pinzgauer: “There is little to beat it. To see it forging uphill through saplings and other obstacles is truly awe-inspiring.” No wonder Daimler hired Steyr-Puch to develop the 4x4 system for the first-ever Mercedes G-Wagen and Fiat the same for its Panda. The conglomerate gradually split up the 1980s, and in a neat piece of symmetry the car-making arm was bought by Daimler in 1998. A buyout came from Canadian parts maker Magna in 2001, and that brings us back to today, with Jaguars being built alongside BMWs and Toyotas.",

    "description": "With the introduction of this CNG version, the Tata Nexon becomes the first car in India to be offered with four fuel options – petrol, diesel, CNG and electric. It’s also the first CNG to use a turbocharged engine and come with a 6-speed manual ’box. Here’s what it’s like to drive. Tata Nexon CNG: exterior and interior Cosmetically, you’ll be hard-pressed to tell the Nexon CNG apart from the rest of the ICE range. The only tell is the ‘i-CNG’ badge on the bootlid and the CNG stickers in the front and rear windshield. Other than that, it retains the standard Nexon’s edgy styling with the same alloy wheel design and LED lighting elements. The Creative Ocean and white dual-tone paint scheme you see here also makes it stand out. Save for the iCNG badge, its exterior is identical to the rest of the ICE Nexon range. Inside, too, the changes are minimal but there are some noticeable ones. For starters, this variant – Persona in Tata speak – gets all-black upholstery with blue stitching on the seats.The trim piece on the dash is also slightly different. There’s a CNG button on the centre console that lets you switch between fuels on the fly, there are CNG-specific graphics in the digital instrument cluster that show you the usage split between petrol and CNG modes, and a CNG-only trip meter. The rotary knob for the drive modes – just behind the gear lever – has also been done away with and it’s replaced by a small cubby that can hold small items like the key fob. Perhaps, Tata could have used this opportunity to give the Nexon at least one proper cup holder; it continues to get them inside the glove box. The front seats are sufficiently large and supportive, and it’s easy to find an ideal driving position. At the back, there’s enough room to sit three passengers in relative comfort and it’s nice to see that the panoramic sunroof hasn’t eaten into the headroom. Boot space is down by 21 litres compared to the petrol Nexon, at 321 litres. The Nexon uses Tata’s innovative twin cylinder tech, which means that you don’t lose out on proper usable boot space or a spare wheel. The two CNG tanks, which have a capacity of 60 litres, are placed below the boot floor while the spare wheel is mounted under the car. Boot space has reduced by 61 litres over the standard Nexon to 321 litres (measured from floor to roof), but you can still fit in a couple of suitcases and soft bags. The space saver spare wheel, meanwhile, can be lowered by loosening a bolt in the boot floor and it's a relatively fuss-free affair. Tata Nexon CNG features and safety Tata was the first manufacturer to offer a CNG even on top-end variants of the Tiago and Tigor, and the Nexon is no different. The Nexon CNG is available in four trim levels, so buyers can opt for the lower running costs of the CNG without having to compromise on features.  The Fearless + PS DT variant you see here is loaded with equipment,with the headlining feature, quite literally, being the panoramic sunroof.This has debuted on the CNG and we expect it to trickle down to the petrol and diesel versions soon. Other features include leatherette upholstery,ventilated front seats (not electrically adjustable), two 10.25-inch screens for the infotainment and instrument cluster, auto climate control, auto headlamps and wipers, a wireless phone charger, and a superb-sounding JBL audio system. But there are some glitches with the screens that need to be ironed out. Rear seat is spacious and it's nice that the panoramic sunroof hasn't compromised headroom. Safety kit like six airbags and ESP are standard on all variants, with the top-spec variant getting a crisp and high-res 360-degree camera, a tyre pressure monitor, front parking sensors and an auto-dimming IRVM. It also received a 5-star safety rating from Global NCAP and Bharat NCAP. There are some CNG-specific safety features that are a part of the package, too: a fire extinguisher, the engine won’t start if the fuel filler flap is open, and it’ll also cut-off CNG supply and release the gas into the atmosphere if it detects a leak in the system. Spare is mounted under the car and can be lowered by loosening a bolt in the boot floor. Tata Nexon CNG engine and gearbox Powering the Nexon CNG is the same 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, turbocharged engine as the petrol Nexon, but it makes 100hp and 170Nm –while the torque is the same, it is 20hp down over the petrol version.However,the torque band is less – it is only available for 1000rpm, unlike the petrol’s 2,500rpm. It comes only with a 6-speed manual gearbox, but Tata could offer an AMT variant later. Thanks to the single ECU that this employs, it can be started up directly in CNG mode, which helps conserve that little extra bit of petrol at startup. There is some noticeable noise and vibration from the engine at idle, but it does smoothen out on the move. Rev it hard though, and the noise does get intrusive inside. Response off the line is good, both in petrol and CNG, and it’s quite eager to respond to part throttle inputs, too. The engine revs freely, but there are some inconsistencies in the power band. Interestingly, it also revs to a more conservative redline of 5,500rpm in CNG, while in petrol it’s 6,000rpm. 1.2-litre, three-cylinder motor puts out 100hp and 170Nm. There is a noticeable difference in the two modes but it’s not as large as you’d expect. The CNG doesn’t make it feel breathless or strained, which means you’ll be happy to let it run in that mode most of the time. the ability to switch between petrol and CNG on the fly makes the entire experience seamless, butthere are no drive modes. The 6-speed manual gearbox has well-defined gates, but the throws are long and the shift action isn’t the most pleasing. What also doesn’t help matters is the snappy nature of the clutch, so you’ll have to get used to its modulation for a smoother drive.  It gets two fuel guages and CNG-specific graphics in the instrument cluster. Tata Nexon CNG performance and fuel efficiency What’s impressive though is the performance, as can be seen in the numbers. In petrol mode, it does the 0-100kph sprint in 13.97s, which is less than a second quicker than the CNG mode. What’s interesting, though, is that it's quicker to 60kph in CNG. There’s a prominent gap in the in-gear acceleration, though, with it being quicker in petrol in both the 20-80kph and 40-100kph runs.

While we didn’t do a full fuel efficiency test, in our preliminary highway test, the Nexon CNG managed to cover 204km at an average speed of 48.19kph and took 7.5kg of gas at the end of our drive. A point to note is that Tata claims the total tank capacity is 9 kilograms; however, unlike petrol or diesel, CNG tanks often take different quantities of gas depending on the time of the day as the change in temperature and pressure can affect its density. Hence, getting an accurate reading is not simple. You’ll also have to contend with the long queues at CNG filling stations. Tata Nexon CNG ride and handling The CNG weighs about 120kg more than the petrol Nexon and Tata has made some changes to the suspension’s spring rate and damping to account for the additional weight. However, there’s not a lot of difference to the way this rides or handles compared to the standard Nexon, and as such, it remains one of this SUV’s strengths. Despite the additional weight, ride and handling remains a strength.  To account for the additional weight of the tanks at the rear, it does feel a bit softer, and though there’s slightly more vertical movement at the rear, it isn’t uncomfortable. Bump absorption remains impressive and the Nexon CNG comes across as a composed SUV. The steering is light at low speeds, enabling you to manoeuvre easily in traffic, and it weighs up nicely as you pick up pace. Tata Nexon CNG price and verdict  Prices for the Nexon CNG range from Rs 8.99 lakh to 14.59 lakh (ex-showroom, India) and buyers will appreciate that it is offered from the base to the top variant. In comparison, its main rival, the Maruti Brezza CNG, is priced from Rs 9.29 lakh to 12.10 lakh (ex-showroom). What’s also nice is the 3 year/ 1,00,000km standard warranty it comes with. Nexon CNG is available in four trims, priced from Rs 8.99 lakh to 14.59 lakh. With the CNG, the Nexon now has the widest powertrain choice in our market, and given the multiple trims and variants on offer, there’s a Nexon for everyone in the range. The top variant is pricey, the refinement isn’t the best and it continues to suffer from ergonomic issues like the standard Nexon. However, with the CNG, you get the benefits of lower running costs.It also delivers in terms of its drivability and performance, so much so that you can use it in CNG mode only. That, coupled with the fact that you don’t miss out on a boot and a spare tyre, sweetens the deal further.

    "description": "Mitsubishi has teased an all-new seven-seater SUV, set to be revealed later this month. The public will get its first look at the Philippine Motor Show, which starts in the coming weeks. While the Japanese brand is no longer present in India, it has a decent line-up overseas, especially in the ASEAN markets. New Mitsubishi three-row SUV will be based on the XForce Expected to come with a 1.5-litre, four-cyl petrol engine Will get multiple drive modes; no 4WD Mitsubishi SUV concept: what does the teaser show? The teaser previews the SUV's overall shape, suggesting it looks like an extended version of the XForce, currently sold in markets such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, and a few other ASEAN nations. The XForce SUV is Mitsubishi’s answer to the Creta in these markets, and this extended version will be the Japanese brand’s Alcazar rival. This new SUV, as seen in the teaser, will have a lot in common with the XForce but will feature some unique styling bits and, of course, an extended wheelbase as key differentiators. On the inside, the new seven-seater SUV will retain the XForce’s dashboard and feature list with a few add-ons. The XForce comes with a 12.3-inch touch infotainment screen, an 8-inch digital instrument cluster, and an 8-speaker sound system developed by Yamaha as a part of its collaboration with Mitsubishi. The centre console houses multiple USB ports, smartphone holders, and a wireless charger. Also, its rear seats can be reclined. Under the hood, we expect the new SUV to come with the same 1.5-litre naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine as the XForce, producing 105hp and 141Nm of torque. It comes with a CVT automatic gearbox as standard and also gets four drive modes: Normal, Wet, Gravel, and Mud. Will the Mitsubishi SUV come to India? Despite being a part of the Renault-Nissan global alliance, there is no official confirmation on Mitsubishi’s India comeback. The brand is currently focused on emerging markets such as Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand. Mitsubishi's sister brands, Renault and Nissan, continue to thrive in the Indian market with models like the Renault Kiger, Triber, and Nissan Magnite. Next year, we will see the all-new Duster and its Nissan counterpart, followed by their seven-seater variants.

    "description": "When a great figure passes away, it is usual for well-wishers and the media to remember and recount various incidents from the person's life to serve as a motivation for others. The passing away of Padma Vibhushan Ratan Naval Tata, one of India's tallest industrialists and the erstwhile chairman of Tata Group, has been no exception. However, the rising prominence of social media has added a new twist to this phenomenon, with the result that many of these incidents can be of questionable veracity. One such tale that seems to have made the jump from social media to mainstream media recounts how Ratan Tata was supposedly 'humiliated' by William (Bill) Ford Jr., the current chairman of Ford Motor Co., during a crucial business meeting in Detroit in 1999. Ratan Tata, the story goes, went to Detroit to explore the sale of his passenger car division, which -- according to the story -- had not gotten off to a great start. Tata, the story claims, was disappointed at the first-year sales of the Indica and wanted Ford to take the car business off his hands. However, during the meeting, the story continues, Bill Ford made it clear that he would only consider buying the division as a favour to Tata, and even asked why his company got into the passenger car business when \"they knew nothing about it.\" Tata, says the story, felt humiliated by this and resolved in his mind to make a success of the passenger car division, determined to show everyone that Tata Motors could make a world-class car. The story is held up as another example of how the West tends to underestimate Indians, and how Ratan Tata -- nine years later -- had the last laugh by buying Jaguar and Land Rover, iconic British brands, from Ford in 2008. So, how much of this story is true? Hormazd Sorabjee, editor of Autocar India, recalls asking Mr. Tata a few months ago about the veracity of the Ford story, which had been rampant on social media for some time. According to Tata, he had a very pleasant conversation with Ford and even spoke of baseball and basketball. In recent times, a lot of fake stories have been attributed to Ratan Tata, which he was forced to clarify on social media. In a statement following Ratan Tata's death, Bill Ford called Tata a \"leader with a vision and integrity\" who \"proved to be an excellent steward of Jaguar and Land Rover,\" and dismissed the dramatic accounts of his meeting with the Indian businessman. “I only had the opportunity to meet Mr. Tata once in person. It was a warm and cordial meeting where we talked about the challenges and joys of running family businesses and our mutual love of cars,\" he said. \"The accounts of our meeting in some press reports could not be any further from the truth,\" he added. \"Ratan’s legacy will continue to inspire future generations of business leaders and entrepreneurs.\" Other sources close to the group also confirmed that the story -- as circulated in the mainstream and social media -- was more fiction than fact. Autocar India also reached out to Ford's official spokesperson, who said: \"These two distinguished individuals held each other in high regard. We believe that Mr. Ford’s views about Mr. Tata present a more complete picture of their professional relationship and mutual respect.\" He noted that several media outlets have characterized the interaction as condescending towards Tata, a narrative that, he said, lacks “credible evidence.” “Since this narrative has always been based on individual perspectives and personal impressions and considering that Mr. Tata never publicly commented on the matter, Ford also opted not to comment on these unsubstantiated claims in the past,” he explained.

    "description": "I’d be surprised if there were more Hondas on display rocking their original motors than engine-swapped examples. K20, K24, B18, and B16 engines are everywhere these days as if there’s a secret team at Honda keeping the production lines alive. And that’s before we even get to the topic of Honda swaps in other makes. […] The post Prepare To Be Shocked: The Road To SEMA 2024 With Rywire appeared first on Speedhunters.",

    "description": "In our last Eldorado installment , a reworked and Fleetwood-bodied 1963 Eldorado’s exterior styling was a bit of a surprise. It stepped away from the dowdy and Chevrolet adjacent styling it carried in 1961 and 1962 and became more slab-sided and refined looking. And even though it was not an entirely new car (as claimed by GM), the styling revisions were enough to set the sixth generation car apart from its predecessor. This week we open the long, heavy doors and see what interior updates were made for ‘63.",

Showing only 21,401 kilometers from new, we believe acquiring this EVO I example is an exceptionally rare opportunity, unlikely to be repeated in today’s market. We also believe this example is among the lowest mileage ones in the world. The Mercedes-Benz 190E EVO I was developed from DTM racing to challenge BMW in the German touring car championship. Built to meet Group A homologation requirements, it featured a Cosworth-tuned engine producing 202 hp, along with aerodynamic upgrades like a rear spoiler and wider fender flares for improved downforce and handling. With a revised suspension for racing demands, the EVO I set the stage for Mercedes’ later dominance in DTM and paved the way for the more aggressive EVO II. Both models reflect the close link between motorsport and street-legal performance cars.   Continue...",

    "description": "Photography by: Zach Brehl (@zachbrehl) 1990 Mercedes-Benz 190E EVO II Location: Miami, Florida Country of original delivery: Netherlands Chassis/VIN: 741313 Mileage: 176.0 kms (109.4 miles) Price: Call for Price The car As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer this museum-grade, impeccably preserved, and concours-ready 1990 Mercedes-Benz 190E EVO II. Showing only 176.0 kilometers from new, we believe acquiring this EVO II example is an exceptionally rare opportunity, unlikely to be repeated in today’s market. We also believe this example to be the 2nd lowest mileage one in the world, as we are aware of a lower mileage car located inside the borders of Russia. The 1990 Mercedes-Benz 190E EVO II was born out of Mercedes' ambition to dominate the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM), Germany’s premier touring car championship in the late 1980s and early 1990s. As DTM regulations required manufacturers to base their race cars on production models, Mercedes developed the EVO II as a homologation special, producing only 502 units for road use. Furthermore, the EVO II introduced significant upgrades over the EVO I, primarily in aerodynamics, engine performance, and handling. Its bold, wind tunnel-tested body kit featured a larger rear wing and front splitter for improved downforce and high-speed stability. The 2.5-liter engine was also more powerful, delivering 235 horsepower compared to the EVO I’s 204 hp. The EVO II’s adjustable suspension, larger 17-inch wheels, and enhanced chassis provided sharper handling and a more responsive driving experience, making it better suited for both the track and the road. These refinements solidified its dominance in DTM racing. Continue...",
