    "description": "This 1981 Ferrari 512 BB is one of 929 carbureted examples produced between 1976 and 1981, and it has remained under the care of the selling dealer's family since 1990. The car was located in Europe until 2004 when it was shipped to the US, and around 2020 it was drained of fluids and kept on static display through 2024. Work in preparation for the sale involved a timing-belt service and replacing the tires, coolant expansion tank, belts, and fluids. Finished in Rosso Corsa and Nero over beige leather, the car is powered by a 4.9-liter F102B flat-12 that is backed by a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Equipment includes air conditioning, a cassette stereo, a gated dogleg shifter, a MOMO steering wheel, and 15\" Cromodora wheels. This 512 BB is now offered with a tool kit and a clean New York title.",

    "description": "Hot version of talented saloon EV is intended to be not just rapid but also engaging When the GTX badge was launched by Volkswagen in 2021, it was tipped as an electric equivalent of – and eventual successor to – the GTI line. But it has suffered by comparison: adding power and straight-line speed is easy on EVs and doesn’t make for an everyday performance hero. Three years later, with new management in Wolfsburg committed to GTI, it’s GTX that’s set to eventually be phased out.Some irony, then, that this new Volkswagen ID 7 GTX showcases exactly what the badge could stand for: a compelling take on what a warmed-up VW EV can be, with a distinct nod towards grand tourers and a different feel to GTI cars.It helps that this new model has an excellent base to work from: in entry-level Pro for the ID 7 was named Autocar's Best Saloon of 2024 and the best in a competitive class that also includes the Tesla Model 3. It's a refined, understated and well-rounded car, a better base to create a GTX model from than the earlier ID 4 and ID 5 SUVs.So is the Volkswagen ID 7 GTX a true electric performance car or, as is often the car with hot EVs, would you be better off sticking to the base model?",

    "description": "The least traditional Jeep gets a hybrid off-roader option that impresses on the rough stuff The Jeep Avenger has to us always felt slightly oxymoronic in its conception as a diddy urban crossover from a brand so intrinsically associated with go-anywhere mud-plugging.The Avenger Electric, mildly electrified eHybrid and pure-petrol variants are competent and charming family runarounds but have little of the off-roading ability of the likes of the larger Wrangler and Grand Cherokee.But now the Avenger can follow its forebears and rangemates at least some way off the beaten track with the addition of this new 4xe range-topper, which adds an off-road-flavoured makeover to the eHybrid, along with an electric motor on the rear axle for four-wheel drive. It is, you might say, the Jeepiest version of the least Jeepy Jeep. This is actually the smallest 4x4 Jeep has offered in about three decades, and while it's far removed from the old CJs and Wranglers that went before, there’s a certain whiff of the WW2 original in the Avenger 4xe’s compact footprint and Scrappy-Doo character. “Lemme at 'em!” it yelps, brandishing its beefier bumpers, roof bars, tow hooks and underbody cladding - the telltale cues to its rugged, range-topping billing and the chief differentiators from the standard eHybrid.It's on sale now in the UK in three trim levels, with prices starting from £30,999, ahead of deliveries beginning in May. But is it the new gem of an expansive Avenger line-up? Read on to find out.",

    "description": "In the world of vintage Ducati restomods, few names resonate as profoundly as Toshiyuki Kozaka. Operating as Switch Stance Riding from a workshop in Amakusa—a series of small islands off the coast of Kyushu, Japan—Kozaka-san has a particular affinity for bevel-driven Ducatis. More so, he has a talent for turning them into masterpieces. Toshi’s latest restomod is not only a testament to his skill, but his supreme taste, too. It’s a 1981 Ducati 900 MHR, reimagined with personal inspiration and reverence for Italian design. The genesis of the project traces back a few years, when Toshi spent time with a friend at Lake Garda in Italy. Riding a different 900 MHR, one that he had just fielded at the European Sultans of Sprint event, he was captivated by the shimmering water and the gradient of the sky.…",

Joe was a force to be reckoned with in the 20s and 30s, competing in everything from dirt- and board-track racing to hillclimb events. But he’s best known for the motorcycle land speed record he set in 1937. Joe flew across the sands of Daytona Beach at 136.183 miles per hour, setting a record that stood for over a decade. His bike was a factory special from Harley-Davidson—a 61 cubic inch overhead valve Knucklehead with streamliner bodywork and no rear suspension. The story goes that the bike’s tail fairing made it unstable in initial runs, so Joe removed it and eked out a win.…",

    "description": "Spending a prolonged duration of time with a vehicle really brings out the nuances of living with it and paints a more detailed picture of how it will fit into your life. In that regard, the Rizta has fared wonderfully well, but over the past two months, one recurring electronic issue has been dampening its otherwise trouble-free experience. But since I’m the sort to sometimes have my dessert before dinner, we’ll start with the good points.  The first thing is that the charger now comes with an elastic cable that latches into place. Where that helps is that you don’t have the charger’s wires strewn about everywhere any time you need to put something in the boot. It may seem small, but it allows you to neatly store your charger and free up more usable space inside the boot for your other belongings.  Neat little elastic strap locks the charger’s wires into place, making storing it in the boot an easier and neater process. Another neat little touch is the small storage cubby just aft of the big 34-litre boot, where I routinely store my phone, keys and a soft microfibre cloth, which is used every so often to clean the Rizta (blame Mumbai’s incessant construction, road works and the dust they kick up!). Keeping your knick-knacks in this smaller area keeps them from getting tossed about inside the big boot on our woefully bouncy roads, something that is especially useful for our expensive modern electronic devices.  Small cubby allows you to securely store small personal items; it’s especially helpful for modern electronic devices. What puzzles me is that Ather hasn’t given the Rizta an external storage cubby, as I’ve seen on multiple other ICE and electric scooters. There is a lot of space to have one on the front apron, and it would save the user the hassle of opening the boot to store their small items every time they set off. Plenty of space available for an external storage cubby on the front apron, but the Rizta doesn’t get one. But the main issue is that over the past two months, I’ve been experiencing an electronic niggle that puts the Rizta into limp mode without any warning. The display shows nothing out of the ordinary except for the regen braking symbol indicating that it’s turned off. And when this happens, power delivery becomes very dull, and I’m unable to cross 25kph. A faulty connector in one of the sensors means it intermittently goes into limp mode without warning. This issue gets resolved temporarily if I cycle the ignition key, but it’s not an everlasting fix, and it reappears without warning. Upon speaking with Ather’s tech team, we have been informed that this has occurred due to a fault in the connector of one of the sensors, and this is the first time someone has reported this occurrence. This electronic niggle has somewhat dampened my confidence in the scooter, and I have been mindful not to stray outside a 10km radius of my home with the Rizta. We will be giving the scooter to the service team for an overall checkup and to have this issue resolved. Once the Rizta is back with us, the rest of our tenure with it, hopefully, will be trouble-free! Also See: Ather Rizta long term review, 1,200km report Ather Rizta long term review, 700km report",

    "description": "The MG Windsor EV is currently India’s bestselling electric vehicle. Credit to MG, then, that it hasn’t waited for interest to wane before bringing out an upgrade. The Windsor EV Pro you see here gets a larger battery and joins the Windsor line-up as the new range-topper, in both price and actual range.  MG Windsor EV Pro exterior design and engineering - 8/10 Mono-volume MPV-esque silhouette stands out among SUVs The MG Windsor has quickly become a familiar sight across many Indian cities and stands out for its MPV-esque mono-volume silhouette. A healthy 186mm of ground clearance, a relatively wide body and large 18-inch rims also establish it as a fairly substantial vehicle. New alloy wheels are the biggest giveaway of this being the Pro variant. This Pro version is only differentiable by its new diamond-cut alloy wheels and ADAS badging on the tailgate. MG has also used the Pro’s launch to add three new paint shades to the Windsor palette – Celadon Blue, Aurora Silver and Glaze Red, as featured here. MG Windsor EV Pro interior space and comfort - 9/10 Spacious and practical interior, thanks to born-electric architecture  If there’s an area where born-electric vehicles like the MG Windsor have a distinct advantage over combustion-engined models re-engineered as electrics, it is space utilisation. The Windsor EV measures just under 4.3 metres in length, but cabin space is significantly better than most like-sized petrol or diesel SUVs. The rear-seat space is a highlight, with ample legroom even for taller occupants and enough shoulder room for three adults to sit comfortably. A flat floor helps middle-passenger comfort, and then there’s the seat. Well-padded and with the option to recline the backrest to a generous degree, it is good enough to interest buyers looking for a chauffeur-driven vehicle. Rear-seat comfort remains a highlight, with ample space for three abreast.  Giving the Windsor EV Pro’s cabin a slightly different vibe is its dual-tone, ivory-on-black colour theme. For reference, the standard Windsor EV gets an all-black theme. While the lighter upholstery does lend a slightly more premium look to the cabin, it will need more attention and effort to keep clean. Another notable point common to all Windsors is that the front seats aren’t as comfy as the ones at the back and feel firmer in their cushioning. White upholstery looks premium but will need effort to keep clean. In every other way, the Windsor EV Pro is identical to the standard model. A massive 15.6-inch touchscreen dominates the dash, with only a few physical buttons for the climate control and hazard lights tucked away lower down. Supplementing the large screen is a smaller, free-standing digital instrument display. It’s a very modern and airy setting that uses colours and textures (there’s a dull wood finish as well as champagne gold details) to good effect, but user-friendliness is a mixed bag. There’s just too much packed onto the touchscreen, and the need to navigate multiple menus on the go is far from ideal. Practicality is well taken care of with plenty of storage, including a large bay under the floating centre console. Access to the luggage area is via a new powered tailgate, and usable space is impressive. The lack of a spare wheel is a big miss, though.   MG Windsor EV Pro features and safety - 9/10 Equipment list is quite extensive for the money  Large 15.6-inch touchscreen controls most functions, including headlights.  The Windsor EV Pro is only offered in the fully loaded Essence trim and packs in lots for the money. Aside from the touchscreen and digital dials, the list includes LED headlights, a powered driver’s seat, front seat ventilation, a panoramic glass roof, configurable ambient lighting, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a loud Infinity sound system and connected tech. Over the standard Windsor, the Windsor Pro also gets additions, such as a powered tailgate and capabilities including vehicle-to-load (V2L enables you to use your vehicle to power appliances) and vehicle-to-vehicle (with V2V, your vehicle can juice up another EV). New ADAS functions have an inconsistent response.  In terms of safety, the Windsor EV Pro builds on the standard Windsor EV’s six airbags, electronic stability control, electric parking brake and ISOFIX child seat mounts with camera and radar-based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The ADAS suite includes intelligent light assist, lane keep assist, emergency braking and adaptive cruise control. Over our test route from Guwahati to Shillong, we found that the ADAS, at times, reacted unnaturally to the driving environment. For instance, on a smooth and clear road, the cruise control would drop speed as if it had detected a vehicle in the vicinity. Lane keep assist was also not consistent in its responses.   A 360-degree camera is included, and it helps in placing the Windsor EV. However, the screen takes quite some time to boot on start-up, so you’ll have to wait patiently if you want a bird’s eye view of your surroundings. Wish MG could have tacked on a rear wiper, which remains a glaring omission on an otherwise feature-loaded car. MG Windsor EV Pro performance and refinement - 8/10 Performance is linear and leisurely  The four drive modes bring about a noticeable difference in power delivery. The EV Pro packs the same 136hp and 200Nm front motor as the standard Windsor EV. Performance is not urgent, but the linear build of power is relaxing. There are four drive modes, and a physical toggle allows easy access. However, we’d recommend you keep to the default Normal setting. Eco and Eco+ feel strangled and should only be used when you are worried about range. Sport mode makes performance sprightlier but also saps charge and range the quickest. While the motor runs quietly, road, wind and suspension noises disturb the calm inside; more on that later. MG Windsor EV Pro ride comfort and handling - 7/10 Hint of firmness at low speeds, vertical movements at higher speeds  The Pro’s larger battery and ADAS addenda have upped the vehicle’s weight by 93kg. At 1.6 tonnes, the Windsor EV Pro is quite heavy for its size, but you won’t feel it as much thanks to the steering that’s light and easy to twirl at low speeds. At higher speeds, too, you get a reasonable sense of connect. However, ride comfort could be better. There’s a firmness that comes through at low speeds, and you can also hear the suspension at work. Up the pace, and there’s also road and wind noise in the cabin. Easy cruises are fine, but wavy surfaces manifest in notable vertical movements. It’s not as settled as, say, a Tata Nexon EV. Ride quality isn't as settled as some of its rivals. Press down on the brake pedal, and you’ll find the Windsor that’s equipped with disc brakes on all four wheels to drop speed with confidence. There’s regen braking, too, with three levels on offer, and you can feel the difference between the levels. However, it lacks the one-pedal drive feature, and there are no physical controls such as paddle shifters to toggle between the regen levels. You have to go into the touchscreen menus, which isn’t ideal. MG Windsor EV Pro range - 8/10 Has an ARAI-claimed range of 449km  The biggest update on the Windsor EV Pro is under the skin. The standard Windsor EV’s 38kWh battery makes way for a 52.9kWh one on the Pro. Consequently, the ARAI-tested range figure jumps to 449km on a single charge from 332km on the standard car. While we will do a full range test when we get the car for a longer duration in Mumbai, it must be mentioned that the standard Windsor’s 308km real-world range achieved over our test loop was very close to the claimed 332km figure. Should the EV Pro deliver the similar efficiency, it’s safe to assume real-world range in the region of 400km-plus. MG Windsor EV Pro price and verdict - 8/10 Remains a very likeable car with the bonus of added range If you were drawn to the MG Windsor EV Pro’s tempting Rs 17.49 lakh launch price, you should know you’ve missed the bus. It was valid only for the first 8,000 buyers. MG has bumped up Windsor EV Pro’s ex-showroom price to Rs 18.1 lakh, which is Rs 2.1 lakh higher than the Windsor with the smaller battery. The added outlay gets you a few more features, but the real hook is the enhanced range. For anyone intending to use their vehicle for intercity commutes, it’s the easy pick of the range. The new Pro variant is the pick of the range for intercity commutes. MG should have worked on the user interface, too, and the ADAS calibration seems rushed, but in other areas, the Windsor EV Pro is very likeable. The roomy cabin makes it a family-friendly choice, performance is pleasant, and you get lots of comfort features for the money. The Windsor EV was already easy to recommend as an electric car. And the Windsor EV Pro is even more so. Also See: MG Windsor Pro video review",

    "description": "The Mahindra Thar range, comprising the 3-door model and the 5-door Roxx, has crossed the 2,50,000 sales milestone in the domestic market. As per data from SIAM, the total dispatches of the Thar from its launch in October 2020 to the end of April 2025 are 2,59,921 units. Until September 2024, when Mahindra launched the Roxx, the Thar was only available in 3-door form. The Roxx has acted as a sales accelerator and now accounts for 45 percent of all Thars sold in India. The Thar and Roxx together account for 15 percent of Mahindra’s sales Thar Roxx’s average monthly sales were 6,431 units in FY2025, versus Thar’s 3,853 units  The Thar brand’s sales rose 74 percent year on year in April 2025 The Thar has hit the 2,50,000 sales milestone 54 months after the introduction of its second-generation model. During these four-and-a-half years, Mahindra sold a total of 17,00,317 SUVs, which gives the two Thar models combined a 15 percent share of the company’s sales.

As per the data table above, 37,844 Thars were sold in FY2022, the first full fiscal year of the model’s sales. The figure rose 24 percent to 47,108 units in FY2023 and 38 percent to 65,246 units in FY2024. Further empowered by the introduction of the new Thar Roxx, sales surged 30 percent in FY2025 to a record 84,834 units. Mahindra Thar vs Thar Roxx sales in FY2025ModelUnitsShareThar (3-door)46,24455%Thar Roxx (5-door)38,59045%TOTAL84,834- In fact, in just six months of launch (October 2024 to March 2025), the Thar Roxx, which won our Car of the Year 2025 award, sold 38,590 units at the wholesale level, averaging 6,431 units a month; it comprised 45 percent of total Thar brand sales of 84,834 units. The 3-door Thar’s sales fell 29 percent in FY2025 to 46,244 units, averaging 3,853 units monthly. Mahindra Thar, Thar Roxx sales in FY2026 Combined Thar and Roxx sales in April 2025 crossed 10,000 unit mark To put it briefly, the Thar Roxx has taken away some of its sibling’s sales, besides eating into the competition. The Thar brand received a booster shot in the Roxx, which should go on to do even better in FY2026. The two Thars have opened FY2026 in the same strong growth trajectory. Combined sales of the Thar Roxx and Thar were 10,703 units in April (up 74 percent from 6,160 units of the 3-door Thar sold in the year-ago period), and they comprised 20 percent of Mahindra’s sales of 52,330 units. In April 2024, when only the 3-door version was on sale, the Thar’s share was 15 percent in Mahindra’s volumes. Mahindra Thar facelift, production expansion details 3-door Thar to get a facelift in 2026 Given the strong and sustained demand for the Thar Roxx, Mahindra has recently confirmed plans to increase production capacity for this model, as well as for the XUV 3XO, by 3,000 units per month. Meanwhile, it is learnt that the company, which surpassed the half-a-million sales milestone for the first time in FY2025, has phased out the convertible top variants of the 3-door Thar and begun work on a facelift (codenamed W515) as a mid-cycle refresh for the 5-year-old model.

Keep reading to know the full schedule (IST timings) and key talking points. 2025 F1 Imola GP schedule After the opening flyaway races, the Imola GP will be the first European race of the year. With most of the teams based close by and the race kicking off another triple-header (with Imola followed by Monaco and Spain), expect to see teams bringing some significant upgrades to Imola. In the past, the Imola GP has usually been a one-stop race. However, that could change this year, with a slight chance of rainfall on race day. Moreover, Pirelli is bringing its softest tyres for the very first time with the hopes of further spicing up the races. McLaren is currently dominating, with Oscar Piastri leading the championship by 16 points from his teammate Lando Norris.
