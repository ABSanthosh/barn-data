    "description": "This Superformance GT40 is a left-hand-drive Mk I example that was ordered approximately two years before arriving in the US as a rolling chassis in January 2024. The car was purchased by the owner in March 2024 and was subsequently completed by Jo’s Garage in Pompano Beach, Florida, with the installation of a 7.3-liter Godzilla V8 that features dry-sump lubrication, eight-stack fuel injection, and a Callies camshaft. Finished in a Gulf livery, the car is equipped with a Quaife five-speed manual transaxle, Wilwood slotted and ventilated disc brakes, Bilstein adjustable coilover shock absorbers, variable power steering, a front-end lift system, staggered-width 15” Halibrand-style wheels with orange-painted spokes, a “bundle of snakes” exhaust system, black seat upholstery with ventilation grommets, air conditioning, Willans harnesses, and Gulf-livery-themed gauges. After its completion in October 2024, the car was showcased at the 2024 SEMA and PRI shows. This Superformance Mk I is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with a clean Florida title in the owner’s name, listing it as a 1969 Ford.",

    "description": "In 2013, Scott Jones of NOISE Cycles showed up at Born Free 5 with a machine that captivated minds: a 1952 Harley-Davidson Panhead morphed into a race-inspired, aluminum-bodied bike with an asymmetrical face. He clutched the “Best in Show” award, netting him a brand new 120R motor from Harley-Davidson that came with the commitment of building a bike around it for the next year’s show. “My mind started spinning immediately,” says Scott. Within days, there was a sketch. The idea was a naked superbike – a bike with a silhouette that looked like the race machines that Eddie Lawson and Wes Cooley piloted to AMA victories. Before work started, however, Jones found himself in the Harley-Davidson Museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After a full day’s time inside the museum that blew his mind, there was a new idea: “The silhouette was going to mimic the WR Racers of the 1940s.”…",

But despite the rollercoaster that the embattled Austrian marque has been on, it hasn’t skipped a beat with new product releases. KTM’s newest release is good news for privateer rally racers; the 2026 KTM 450 Rally Replica is here, and it’s as desirable as ever.

    "description": "We recently took the Tuono 457 to the CoASTT High Performance Centre for our annual track day, and even though I missed out on testing it on the street, hopping on it at the track was worth the wait. It was so impressive, in fact, that it deserved a standalone story of its own. Aprilia Tuono 457 design (8/10) A good looking design but the traditional Tuono face is missed. The Tuono is essentially an RS 457 in streetwear – same engine, chassis, suspension, brakes and tyres. The tank is slightly reshaped, and of course, those upright handlebars change the ergonomics. But the big surprise was that the lap time in Rajini Krishnan’s hands was nearly identical to the RS 457’s at our 2024 Track Day. No clip-ons, no wind protection, and less front-end load, yet it hung right in there. That’s remarkable. The fuel tank shape is slightly reprofiled on the Tuono. A few things played to the Tuono’s advantage this year. The track surface at the CoASTT was in better shape than the last time we visited, the weather was a little kinder, and, as always, familiarity counts. This bike also ran the optional quickshifter, something Rajini appreciated. It’ll set you back Rs 20,000 – not cheap by any stretch, especially on a sub-Rs 4 lakh machine – but it works well and really adds to the experience. Aprilia Tuono 457 ergonomics (6/10) Acessible seat height but cramped for tall riders. Like with the RS 457, the real gem remains the engine, and Aprilia’s 457cc parallel-twin continues to be the segment’s crown jewel. 48 horsepower and segment-leading torque only tell half the story. The motor is also very smooth, and it packs crisp throttle response and a rich and evocative sound. With that wide, sculpted tank between your legs and the bike’s superbike-like soundtrack, there’s a genuine sense of occasion every time you roll on the gas. That said, it’s not all roses. Ergonomics is where the Tuono 457 will leave taller riders wanting – especially on track. I found myself cramped against the rear seat bump stop, with the bike’s bodywork feeling particularly slippery. The already compact RS 457 felt more accommodating with its wide, more forward set clip-ons, but the Tuono’s setup makes the cockpit feel more restrictive. Some of this can easily be fixed by adding some grip tape and maybe by modifying the rear seat to allow the rider more room to slide back. But if you’re close to 6 feet tall, you will find this bike cramped – particularly in how the fuel tank recesses lock your knees in place – and that won’t be just at the race track. Aprilia Tuono 457 performance (9/10) Superb mid-range makes up for flat top-end and it makes a great sound. Beyond the hard metrics, the Tuono 457 is engaging, playful and, crucially, fast enough to make every session exciting. The aluminium chassis, firm suspension and impressive Eurogrip Pro Torque Xtreme tyres all come together to make this (along with the RS 457) probably the most impressive handling bike ever to be made in India.  Quickshifter is an impressive but expensive option CoASTT is a flowing circuit with few heavy braking zones, and while the 457’s front brake fade is a known issue, it wasn’t a problem here. That said, if you plan on hitting more tracks with more demanding braking zones, upgrading the pads, fluid, or master cylinder is something you’ll have to look into. Aprilia Tuono 457 handling (9/10) Chassis, suspension and tyres work well but brake fade needs to be addressed. What makes the Tuono so special is that it isn’t a detuned RS that trades capability for comfort. It carries the same spirit, the same capability, and nearly the same lap times. Unfortunately, it’s not all perfect. First, there’s the bike’s size and the fact that the design isn’t as evocative as the RS 457, which is more visually linked to its bigger siblings.  More worryingly, however, there have also recently been some customer reports of unexpected engine reliability issues, and this is something that Aprilia needs to address in a speedy and decisive manner. From a sheer capability standpoint, though, the Tuono 457 has exceeded expectations, and that’s not something that happens very often. Aprilia Tuono 457 verdict (9/10) Nearly as capable as the RS 457 and with considerably more seat comfort.  What really struck me is how this bike stacks up against the competition. Whether it’s KTM’s singles or Yamaha’s twin-cylinder offerings, the Tuono feels like it’s operating on a higher plane – especially on a fast circuit like CoASTT that rewards power and flow. In fact, the lap time is closer to more powerful bikes like the Suzuki GSX-8R and Ducati Hypermotard Mono than it is to rivals like the KTM 390 Duke and Yamaha R3.

    "description": "The Land Rover Defender Octa made landfall in India last month with a starting price of Rs 2.59 crore (ex-showroom), while the limited-run ‘Edition One’ is tagged at Rs 2.79 crore. It is not just the most powerful and extreme Defender ever built but also the most expensive. In fact, it costs a hefty Rs 1.07 crore more than the Defender V8, previously the priciest variant at Rs 1.52 crore. But make no mistake: this isn’t just another cosmetic special or a new trim line with a catchy name. The Octa has been thoroughly re-engineered from the ground up. The familiar supercharged 5.0-litre V8 has been swapped for the BMW-sourced 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 paired with mild-hybrid tech, which has also been used by Range Rover. It produces a colossal 635hp and a maximum 800Nm of torque – figures that place it squarely in the realm of high-performance SUVs. Land Rover claims it will accelerate from 0 to 100kph in just 4 seconds. We’ve driven the Octa in the wilds of South Africa, but how does it fare in the ‘wilds’ of India? This is a very different kind of jungle. One where deep potholes can swallow a wheel, monsoon-induced craters appear overnight thanks to shoddy roadwork, and unmarked speed breakers can launch you skyward. Axle-twisting ruts left behind by overloaded trucks and the unpredictability of two-wheelers weaving through traffic only add to the madness. 2025 Defender Octa exterior design and engineering In conditions like these, what you need most is ground clearance, and the Octa has that in abundance. With a towering 323mm of clearance in its highest setting, this brute can crawl over almost anything. A class-leading water-wading depth of 1 metre means you won’t think twice about driving through a flooded Mumbai street in peak monsoon. No road is too tough for the Octa, thanks to its immense ground clearance. Height is the Octa’s most dramatic dimension. It stands 28mm taller and 68mm wider than a standard Defender 110, its bulging arches stretched to accommodate serious rubber. In South Africa, we tested it with aggressive off-road tyres; our India-spec test vehicle, however, had equally chunky BF Goodrich Trail-Terrain rubber. These 275/60 R20 tyres form a strong line of defence against bad roads, with ultra-tall sidewalls and tough construction that shrugs off sharp edges and potholes. This is the Defender dialled up to eleven. The Octa gets a unique grille, reinforced bumpers, a solid metal bash plate and four exhaust pipes poking out the rear. Even the traditional Land Rover badge gives way to a geometric Octa logo – a nod to the octahedron, the shape of a diamond and a symbol of strength. The Edition One, finished in a stunning Faroe Green and loaded with every optional extra, is for those who want true exclusivity. Naturally, that sort of statement doesn’t come cheap – Rs 2.79 crore, to be exact. 2025 Defender Octa interior space and comfort Octa-specific 14-way adjustable seats hug you for a secure ride. When you want to enter the cabin, that added height does have a drawback. Even with the air suspension dropped to its lowest setting, the cabin is still a climb. The grab handle on the dashboard, rather than the A-pillar, doesn’t offer ideal leverage either. But once you’re inside, the commanding driving position and panoramic visibility make you feel like you own the road. The high-set rear seat is comfortable, but getting in and out is tricky. Access to the rear seat is a bit easier thanks to a well-placed handle, but elderly passengers – or anyone in a saree – will still struggle with the ingress and egress. The back seat is high-set, generously cushioned and very comfortable, with good space even for three abreast. Open the side-hinged tailgate, spare wheel and all, and there’s a generous luggage area that completes the Octa’s family credentials. Generous storage space with rubberised surfaces for added practicality.   2025 Defender Octa features and safety kit Infotainment system brims with performance stats and real-time data. Inside, the Octa retains the Defender’s signature blend of ruggedness and refinement – but with a sporty twist. The 14-way adjustable front sport seats are upholstered in a mix of leather and Ultra fabric, a tough, lightweight, weather-resistant material that shrugs off heat, sweat, dust and monsoon muck. So, yes, you can climb in soaking wet with a muddy dog and not worry. But let’s be honest; in India, most Octa owners won’t stray far from the tarmac or risk dirtying their designer loafers. Exclusive Edition One features carbon-fibre trim for a touch of luxury. The Khaki-Ebony theme in the Edition One, contrasted with carbon-fibre accents and unique upholstery patterns, sets it apart from the standard Defender cabin. Octa-specific touches include new display graphics, performance menus and a dedicated ‘Octa’ mode button on the steering wheel. In Octa mode, the gearshift paddles light up, adding a sporty touch. Tech-wise, the Octa runs the latest generation of JLR’s infotainment system – slick, intuitive and enriched with drive-specific features. Crucially, Land Rover hasn’t sacrificed usability for form. Important controls, like those for the HVAC system, are still managed via physical dials and buttons, not buried in menus. 2025 Defender Octa performance and refinement Defender Octa Edition One performance as testedAcceleration (kph)Time (seconds)0-200.880-401.730-602.580-803.610-1004.750-1206.2620-80 (in kickdown)3.0240-100 (in kickdown)3.31 Driving something that costs north of Rs 3 crore through Mumbai’s chaotic traffic should be nerve-racking, but the Defender Octa flips that script. Its sheer presence parts traffic like Moses did the Red Sea. Smaller vehicles keep their distance, and that, in itself, reduces stress. You sit high, with excellent all-round visibility, and with 750Nm of torque at your command, overtakes are effortless (the maximum torque is 800Nm in the Dynamic launch mode). The Octa rides beautifully over Mumbai’s patchy roads – firm but never harsh. Unlike traditional ladder-frame off-roaders like the G-Wagen or Wrangler, the Octa doesn’t toss you around or feel unwieldy. On the newly opened AtalSetu, Mumbai’s 22-km trans-harbour sea link, the Octa finally stretches its legs. Floor the throttle, and the 4.4-litre V8 responds with a refined snarl piped through the quad exhausts. It’s not as loud or dramatic as the outgoing supercharged V8 or AMG’s thunderous G63, but it is potent. BMW-sourced 4.4-litre V8 churns out 635hp and 800Nm of torque. We timed a 0-100kph sprint in 4.7 seconds, slightly off the claimed time but still blisteringly quick for a 2.5-tonne SUV. What’s more impressive is how flat and composed the Octa feels at speed. There’s little roll or pitch, and the body control is astonishing for something this tall. 2025 Defender Octa ride comfort and handling On the sinuous Lonavala Ghat section of the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, the Octa corners with confidence; the quick and accurate steering lets you change direction confidently. However, you do feel the mass and height when quickly transitioning through a series of corners, and the tall all-terrain tyres blunt the steering response. The thing is that the Octa goads you to push it hard, to drive fast, and at high speeds, you might spot potholes too late. But instead of swerving to avoid them, the Octa, without flinching, can just drive through them as if they don’t exist. The Octa’s real ace is its trick new suspension. Called 6D Dynamics, this advanced setup uses hydraulically linked dampers in place of traditional anti-roll bars, allowing it to control pitch and roll in real time. The Octa is a long-distance champion, effortlessly covering miles, no matter the surface. On Indian roads, it’s a revelation. Over rough patches, potholes and speed breakers, the Octa doesn’t bounce, lurch or feel unsettled like a typical tall SUV. It isn’t as plush as a Range Rover, which cocoons you from the outside world, but it strikes a near-perfect balance between feedback and comfort. You feel the road beneath you – but you don’t suffer it. We peel off the highway past Lonavala, heading towards Nanoli. This is rural Maharashtra, where the roads are narrow, the tarmac is patchy, and life slows down. Well, not quite. The Octa seems to thrive in these backwaters. You sit high, steering around goats, cyclists and the occasional overambitious biker, and that sense of control never fades. On these narrow roads, it is common to drop the inside two wheels off the road and onto the earthen shoulders to give way to oncoming traffic. In the Octa, you can do that without slowing down. Nothing – absolutely nothing – catches the Octa out. If anything, the Octa makes rural motoring feel almost luxurious. We reach the still-under-construction Nanoli Speedway. It’s a mud-laced ribbon of what will soon be a world-class racetrack. But for now, it’s a gravel racetrack, a loose surface for some high-speed antics. This is the time to switch to Octa mode and switch off the traction control. The Octa is shockingly easy to drift and slide like a rally car. The sense of control and the confidence you get flicking this massive SUV around the 3km dirt track make you feel like a Dakar champion. You finish the session not sweaty and tired but with the cooled seats on and your favourite music playing. 2025 Defender Octa price and verdict Unsurprisingly, Land Rover is gunning squarely for the Mercedes-AMG G 63 with the Rs 2.59 crore-2.79 crore Octa. The G 63, with its powerful and glorious-sounding V8, might still have more street cred and an irresistible charm that has won it a legion of fans, but it’s nowhere near as capable or rounded a car as the Octa, which does practically everything better. Other performance SUVs, such as the Porsche Cayenne or Lamborghini Urus, exist, but they’re far more road-biased and can’t take a serious bashing – especially with their low-profile tyres. That’s why the Octa stands in a league of its own: equally at ease navigating the chaotic sprawl of Mumbai, drifting sideways down a gravel road, tackling remote Ladakhi tracks, or wading through a metre-deep river. Yes, it’s super expensive, but for those who can afford it, the Octa is luxury with a wild streak – built not just to survive India’s roads but to dominate them.

    "description": "This feels familiar. This time last year, I was right here, at the CoASTT high-performance centre, sweltering heat searing my skin, with the keys to a 911 in my hands. I was giddy with excitement then, and I am once again now. The difference is that last year, I had for company what I consider the pinnacle of modern 911 engineering, the mighty GT3 RS, and as the Porsche nerds among you know, that version comes near the end of the car’s mid-life cycle. So now the model range has been reset, and we’ve gone from the top of the pecking order back down to the bottom with this 992.2 Carrera. Porsche 911 Carrera exterior design and engineering Only aficionados will spot the wider LEDs that mark out the 992.2. Don’t let the dramatic wing fool you – this isn’t a GT3 but rather a Rs 11 lakh aero kit option.In fact, in classic Porsche fashion, there are a lot of options you can add to your Carrera (this car has Rs 67 lakh worth) to help make it look, feel and perform better. But I’m here to tell you that, even if you don’t, through the power of immaculate engineering, you will still be in possession of one of the finest sports cars on the planet. DRLs, indicators moved into headlamp, so bumper is free for aero, cooling. One of the most underappreciated facets of a 911, I find, is how easy it is for anyone to just get in and go fast. Stepping in, it immediately feels welcoming and familiar. But even if you’ve never driven one before, the great forward visibility, thin A-pillars, visual markers in the form of the raised fenders, a driving position that’s not overly aggressive, a slim-rimmed steering wheel, and an uncluttered dashboard ease you in. Porsche 911 Carrera interior and features Like all modern cars, it too has succumbed to screens; the 10.9-inch touchscreen returns, and behind the steering wheel, the wonderful central analogue tachometer has met its inevitable demise, replaced by a full-digital screen. But even here, Porsche has to be applauded for keeping both screens simple, legible and free of distraction. Sacrilege! Iconic five dials go full digital but remain easy to read. The PCM (Porsche Communication Management; how German) 6.0 interface is one of the cleanest and least complicated while still being packed with features. And though they’ve gone digital, the dials still look like ‘dials’, albeit with a number of configurations, ranging from the classic 911 5-dial setup to a full map display. You can even reorient the tacho to have the redline at the top of the circle. Tactile, twist-to-start knob replaced by boring starter button. There are now no rear seats by default, but they can be optioned for no cost. However, a change I’m less enthused about is the switch from the twist-to-start ignition knob to a regular start/stop button; a small but annoying blow to driver involvement. Porsche 911 Carrera performance and refinement Porsche 911 Carrera specsLength/width/height 4582mm/1852mm/1302mm Wheelbase 2450mmEngineFlat-six, 2981cc, twin-turbo petrol Power 394hp at 7,500rpm Torque 450Nm at 2,000-5,000rpm Gearbox8-speed dual-clutch auto Kerb weight 1520kg 0-100kph 3.9 seconds (claimed)Economy 9.6kpl (WLTP) While on the topic, does choosing the ‘lowly’ Carrera rob you of even more driver involvement? The twin-turbo 3.0-litre flat-six certainly doesn’t disappoint. 394hp and 450Nm might sound meek in absolute sports car terms, but trust me when I say they’re more than plenty. Even out on the race track, where all but the fastest cars can feel slow, it never feels lacking. 911 hallmarks remain: great visibility, pointy front end, perfect driving position. Maybe it’s the tremendous sound from the optional sports exhaust, the instantaneous responses, or the ceaseless thrust you get all the way to 7,500rpm. It’s not the goosebump-inducing 4.0-litre naturally aspirated screamer you find in the GT3s, but it doesn’t fall far behind. You could even argue that its more accessible power makes it better for everyday use. Incidentally, compared to the old 992.1 Carrera, they didn’t just pump up the boost pressure and call it a day. It’s got different turbos, borrowed from the outgoing 911 GTS, and new intercoolers out of the Turbo S. Porsche 911 Carrera ride and handling Fantastic as the engine is, I’d argue that what truly makes a 911 is the chassis, and I’m happy to report that it is, as ever, impeccable. A downside is you can’t specify any handling-enhancing options on a Carrera, as you can on higher 911s. Adaptive dampers are standard, but not on the options menu are PDCC (active roll stabilisation), PCCB (carbon-ceramic brakes) or, most disappointingly, rear-wheel steering. Balanced as it is, a firm prod will swing its heavy rear around like a pendulum. So, it’s a testament to how solid the core setup is that it doesn’t suffer for this. 60 years of honing has turned an inherently unbalanced weight distribution into a deftly balanced one. It’s slightly pendulous, not overwhelmingly so, with the rear-engine layout helping the back of the car be a little livelier around corners. The steering has heft and is supremely communicative.  As ever, no engine weight at the front means the steering remains uncorrupted. It’s sharp, it’s got heft, and it is full of micro-communications fed directly to your palms. The car’s limits are high but also clearly spelled out, so as I approach them on the fast right-hander that is C1, I know almost instinctively how far down the throttle travel my foot has to be to induce some oversteer without overcooking it. You gotta love track time! Porsche 911 Carrera price and verdict Really, there’s nothing entry-level about the new Porsche 911 Carrera then. Certainly not its Rs 2.11 crore starting price (ex-showroom); that was how much a previous-gen Turbo cost when it was new. And, of course, once you start rummaging through the options list, the sky is the limit. The base Carrera offers 85 percent of the 911 experience.   Though we didn’t drive it on the road much, you already know what to expect there. The nose-lift kit is an essential option to tick. The ride quality is firm but compliant – stay away from the larger wheel size if that’s a concern. The front boot is more spacious than its 135 litres would suggest. But the simple fact that it’s got me grinning as wide as I was last year with the GT3 RS – and without pulverising me along the way – speaks volumes. It tells me that the humble Carrera is 85 percent of the way there, and moving up the range is an exercise in diminishing returns. That’s not to say you won’t get more out of a Turbo S or a GT3 or even a GTS t-hybrid; but rather that you can’t go wrong with any 911.

If this smaller sibling of the bZ4X looks familiar, it’s because we recently drove the Suzuki eVitara, which is essentially the same car.Toyota and Suzuki are all in on the not-so-noble art of badge engineering. It’s been a few years since Suzuki started selling the Corolla estate and RAV4 as the Swace and Across, so now it’s Suzuki’s turn to return the favour.The name Urban Cruiser itself might ring a bell. Back in 2008, Toyota applied it to an uninspiring, taller version of the Yaris. In a way, it was ahead of its time, because B-segment crossovers (like the Yaris Cross) are now wildly popular, yet it failed to leave much of a mark. Toyota will be hoping this new electric one can do better.",

    "description": "Toyota responds to criticism of electric family crossover with big update The Toyota bZ4X, the brand’s all-important mid-size electric SUV (or Tesla Model Y fighter, if you want to be confrontational) didn’t have the easiest start to life: delays, an early recall and then controversy over how big its battery actually was and how averse it was to cold weather. Now it’s facelift time, and as that original car didn’t get the most rapturous reception, it’s a pretty comprehensive one. The front fascia has been revised with slimmer headlights and the wheel-arch trims, which were unpainted black, are now gloss black. More significantly, it has had a range boost, thanks to both a bigger battery and improved efficiency. By reconfiguring the shape of the pack and the gubbins surrounding it, the engineers have shoehorned in eight extra cells, taking its capacity from 71.4kWh to 73.1kWh (69.0kWh of which is usable). There’s also a new version with a smaller battery (57.7/54.0kWh), but don't expect to see many of those in UK. To make sure it lives up to Toyota's reputation of long-livedness, there's now a menu in the instrument cluster that shows the battery's state of health. It tells you what percentage of the battery's original capacity remains. By using silicon-carbide inverters and polishing the teeth (dentists recommend both mornings and evenings) of the gearbox, the engineers have also made the drivetrain use less energy, despite a useful bump in power. Tweaks to the front subframe and extra adhesive in the floor have increased chassis rigidity, while the springs, dampers and bushings have been retuned to make it feel more settled and improve the ride, particularly for the rear passengers. The interior also came in for some criticism before, so that has had a makeover too. These changes have been partially successful. The old gloss black centre console with a hidden phone storage is swapped for a matt one with two wireless charging pads – much better. The Lexus RZ has donated its larger, more sophisticated multimedia system, which means the bZ4X loses a few physical buttons overall, but most of those have moved onto a permanent toolbar on the touchscreen. Compared to the RZ, the infotainment has had a very subtle upgrade, but one that makes a big difference. For years, the screen in a Toyota or Lexus would be completely taken over by Apple CarPlay, so returning to the native interface was a pain. Now the shortcut bar stays, making the whole thing miles easier to use. It’s quite a nice system now. The last major change is that the pieces of fabric that lined the dashboard have been replaced with textured rubber. It’s soft to the touch and has a certain air of indestructability about it, but the resulting sea of black does make the cabin look pretty dour. The space inside hasn’t changed. Rear passengers have good knee room but there’s a high floor and the boot is merely adequate. The seats are still quite comfortable. Like most EVs, the bZ4X never needed more power, but then it was one of the slower models in its class, so maybe it did. Either way, the dual-motor version has gained a rather substantial 124bhp (that’s an entire Citroën ë-C3), which has dropped its 0-62mph time by 1.8sec, and you can feel it: it’s really quite brisk now. With its more modest 20bhp boost, the single-motor version remains an adequate but unremarkable performer. Some paddles have sprouted from the steering wheel to control the regenerative braking. There’s a free-wheeling mode but true one-pedal and adaptive modes remain absent. The by-wire brake pedal is nicely progressive. I was slightly surprised that Toyota tinkered with the dynamics, because I always thought the bZ4X drove quite nicely, albeit in a slightly forgettable way. Thankfully, the car’s character hasn’t changed radically. It still treads a middle ground between the overtly boaty Hyundai Ioniq 5 and the more try-hard sporty Kia EV6 and Tesla Model Y that suits it well. Mostly the ride is nicely settled and the handling unexcitingly competent. Wheel size (18in or 20in) has a negligible impact on ride comfort, although the car seems slightly quieter on the motorway with the smaller wheels. This may just be down to the different tyres, though. Since its launch, the hot topic with the bZ4X has been range and charging. WLTP range has jumped from 286 to 314 miles for the dual-motor version on 18in wheels and from 312 to 354 miles for the single-motor version. The 20in wheels inflict a 20-30 mile penalty. I didn’t get enough time in the dual-motor version to get a representative economy figure, but the single-motor version on 18in wheels returned 3.9mpkWh. For a big car like this, even in perfect weather, that’s pretty impressive, and it means that even though the battery is over 10kWh smaller than some rivals’, range is competitive. How the new car will hold up in the cold is the critical question; thankfully, it will be winter by the time we can deliver our UK verdict. It should at least fast-charge better in cold conditions, which used to be a problem. The peak charging speed stays at 150kW, but the bZ4X has gained a pre-conditioning function to make sure it can hit that rate even in winter. It’s too early for prices, but given that the bZ4X is currently a bit more expensive than the equivalent Ioniq 5 or Renault Scenic, I’d hope that Toyota would nibble at it a bit. Toyota hasn’t been the most enthusiastic adopter of EVs, and that has shown in the product. This update doesn’t suddenly propel the bZ4X to the top of its class but has been quite effective in keeping it a solid, no-nonsense option with, in the case of the dual-motor version, some off-roadability. We’re still waiting for that breakout EV from Toyota, though. 2026 Toyota bZ4X 73kWh FWD Will be much better to live with than before but remains a slightly anonymous option in its class.

    "description": "Just about a month ago, we reported that Mahindra plans to introduce new variants to the XEV 9e line-up, essentially to make the large 79kWh battery pack a little more accessible. Now, a recent filing by Mahindra on the government’s transport website corroborates our report while also shedding details on the upcoming variants. 79kWh battery to be made available on Pack Three Select trim Top-spec Pack Three to also get the smaller 59kWh battery Similar updates are expected on the BE 6 soon Mahindra XEV 9e new trim details Two new trims incoming  Currently, the larger 79kWh battery on the Mahindra XEV 9e is only offered with the top-spec Pack Three trim, while all lower trims come with the 59kWh battery pack. With the update, Mahindra will offer the 79kWh battery with the second-from-base Pack Three Select trim; meanwhile, the choice of a 59kWh battery will be made available with the top-spec Pack Three trim. Mahindra should, therefore, be able to price the Pack Three trim also more competitively. The Pack Three exclusively comes with the ADAS suite and head-up display, but speaking to Autocar India, Rajesh Jejurikar, the company’s executive director and CEO (Auto and Farm Sector), had previously said that customers are prioritising higher range over features. Mahindra XEV 9e powertrain, variant details The XEV 9e is currently available in four trims: Pack One, Pack Two, Pack Three Select and Pack Three. There are two battery pack options: 59kWh and 79kWh. The former produces 231hp/380Nm and has a range of 542km; the latter makes 286hp/380Nm and returns 656km (ARAI); both are rear-wheel-drive only.

Pack Three Select deliveries just started in June, and Pack Two and Pack One will only be delivered from July and August onwards, respectively.

    "description": "The 2025 MRF MMSC Indian National Motorcycle Racing Championship (INMRC) kicked off, with Round 1 held at Madras International Circuit. The round saw the introduction of the new Pro-Stock 165-200cc category, running race-prepped TVS Apache GP200R bikes (based on the Apache RTR 200 4V). 11-time national champion Rajini Krishnan also returns for a full season in the INMRC. RACR Castrol Power1’s Rahil Pillarisetty, Petronas TVS Racing’s Sarthak Chavan and Mad Rabbit Racing’s Savion Babu emerged as the big winners at Round 1. However, several races were cancelled on the final day as a thunderstorm caused considerable damage to the facility. Pro-Stock 301-400cc It was a near-photo finish for Race 1. Reigning Pro-Stock 301-400cc champion Chavan passed polesitter Pillarisetty on the very last lap after trailing him throughout the race.
