    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/peugeot-gti-back-revered-badge-returns-hot-278bhp-208",
    "description": "French brand relaunches performance moniker at 24 Hours of Le Mans Peugeot’s revered GTi badge has returned to appear on its first electric performance car, a hot hatch based on the e-208 that is aimed squarely at compatriot Alpine’s A290. Its launch at this week's 24 Hours of Le Mans marks the return of one of the most evocative badges in performance motoring, after the 308 GTi went off sale in 2021. It is also the first hot Peugeot since the 508 PSE was axed in late 2024. Developed by Peugeot Sport and inspired by the widely admired 205 GTi, the new car represents a dramatic overhaul of the city-focused e-208. The key to the package is a motor transplant from the 208’s larger cousin, the Alfa Romeo Junior Veloce. Mounted up front and paired with a mechanical limited-slip differential, it puts out 278bhp and 254lb ft – a substantial increase on the power of the regular 154bhp e-208. These reserves slingshot the 1596kg hatchback to 62mph in 5.7sec – 0.2sec quicker than the 255bhp Mini John Cooper Works Electric and 0.7sec ahead of the 217bhp Alpine A290 GT Performance. Its top speed is claimed to be 112mph. Alongside that extra pace, it is fitted with hydraulic bump-stops and a rear anti-roll bar. The steering is also said to have been tuned for more direct responses. The new GTi gains a look that matches its performance billing. The hot hatch is 30mm lower than the standard car and the tracks have been widened by 56mm at the front and 27mm at the rear to create a muscular stance. Changes compared to the standard e-208 include a front lip, a new rear spoiler and a chunky rear diffuser – which has a motorsport-inspired integrated rear fog light. What’s more, it gets bold 18in alloys that are inspired by those fitted to the later 1.9-litre 205 GTi and wear the original GTi typeface. These are shod with track-focused Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tyres; sited behind them up front are a set of 355mm brake discs. The fitment of such large wheels with the GTi’s low-set stance has required wheel-arch extensions, marked out with bright red stripes that match the body’s paintwork. The 205 references continue inside the e-208 GTi: the bucket seats are split between red and black panels, and the floor mats are trimmed in red too. Elsewhere, it's the same cabin as the standard e-208 but with Alcantara added to the seats and steering wheel. Modifications have also been made to the e-208 GTi’s battery performance. While the 54kWh nickel-manganese-cobalt pack is the same as the standard car’s, Peugeot said it has adapted the software using developments from its hybrid-powered 9X8 endurance racer to reduce temperatures under high loads and improve energy recovery. The pack yields a range of 217 miles between charges and can be replenished from 20-80% in less than 30 minutes on a 100kW DC connection. “The new Peugeot e-208 GTi embodies our commitment to performance and innovation, drawing from our extensive race pedigree,” said Jean-Marc Finot, senior vice-president of Stellantis’s motorsport operations. Finot, previously an engineer involved in the development of the original 205 GTi as well as the later 206 GTi 180, added that the new car will possess “the typical Peugeot GTi agility and steering feeling”. While the GTi badge returns first on an electric model, new hot combustion Peugeots have not been ruled out – but Peugeot CEO Alain Favey previously told Autocar that any decision would depend on customer feedback. “We will start with the e-208 and [are] definitely listening to your inputs, or what our customers will say as well,” he said. “We don't exclude that there might be other executions of the 208 GTi under the GTi badge, but for today there's absolutely nothing planned in that sense.\"",

    "description": "Fiat CEO Olivier François said battery-swapping tech will be offered to customers if trial is successful Stellantis is trialling battery-swapping technology with the Fiat 500e in a bid to offer full EV recharging in just five minutes. If the trial is successful, this could eliminate one of the biggest barriers to EV ownership: charging time. Currently taking place in Madrid, the trial involves a small fleet of 40 500es that have been adapted to use a pack (of unspecified size) from battery-swapping firm Ample. The fleet is operated by Stellantis-owned car-sharing firm Free2Move and being driven by users in the city. The cars are currently serviced by a single battery-swapping station, but more are planned to be created in the city as part of the trial, which has been supported by a €9.8 million (£8.2m) grant from the Spanish government. What’s more, Stellantis plans to expand the fleet to 100 cars in the coming months. If the trial is successful, the technology will be offered to private customers, promised Fiat CEO Olivier François. “We are dedicated to thoroughly testing and analysing this concept in real-world conditions and aiming to expand it to private customers soon,\" he said. “That is why we believe deeply in this project and have chosen our iconic Fiat 500 to spearhead the initiative. \"It will provide invaluable insights for both our brand and the group as we shape the future of mobility.” It's unclear if the trial will be expanded to other Stellantis EVs, given that the 500e is based on a bespoke platform and not the e-CMP EV platform used by Citroën, Peugeot, Vauxhall et al.",

    "description": "Pepo Rosell, better known as XTR Pepo, is a force of nature. He originally burst onto the scene with his specialist custom workshop, Radical Ducati, before taking a break and relaunching as a solo act. Often inspired by classic endurance racers, Pepo’s bikes convey a sense of speed—with a hint of eccentricity. Pepo’s portfolio is dripping with exotic twin-cylinder Italian machines, but he’s just as adept at applying his talents to smaller bikes. He’s just buttoned up this Royal Enfield Guerrilla 450, and it’s every bit as radical as you’d expect an XTR Pepo motorcycle to be. In stock form, the Guerrilla 450 is a peppy single-cylinder roadster with a look that deviates from the Indian marque’s traditional aesthetic. But in the hands of Pepo, it’s a feisty supermono racer with tons of attitude.…",

    "description": "In Taiwan, small bikes rule the roost. The country is bursting with sub-200 cc commuter motorcycles, many of which are produced locally. They’re easy to handle in tight traffic, robust, and easy to maintain—and since they’re not subject to the same taxes as bigger bikes, they’re more affordable too. The utilitarian nature of these plucky single-cylinder machines means that, although they’re visually bland, they’re also very simple. And that makes them ripe for customization. The Taiwanese workshop 2LOUD Custom knows this all too well. Founder Ma ‘Max’ Yicheng has churned out countless customs based on small bikes from popular local brands like Kymco and SYM. Today, he’s treating us to a delightful Yamaha SR150 street tracker. A distant cousin of the more famous Yamaha SR500, the now-defunct SR150 was built in Taiwan exclusively for the local market.…",

    "description": "We recently took the Tuono 457 to the CoASTT High Performance Centre for our annual track day, and even though I missed out on testing it on the street, hopping on it at the track was worth the wait. It was so impressive, in fact, that it deserved a standalone story of its own. Aprilia Tuono 457 design (8/10) A good looking design but the traditional Tuono face is missed. The Tuono is essentially an RS 457 in streetwear – same engine, chassis, suspension, brakes and tyres. The tank is slightly reshaped, and of course, those upright handlebars change the ergonomics. But the big surprise was that the lap time in Rajini Krishnan’s hands was nearly identical to the RS 457’s at our 2024 Track Day. No clip-ons, no wind protection, and less front-end load, yet it hung right in there. That’s remarkable. The fuel tank shape is slightly reprofiled on the Tuono. A few things played to the Tuono’s advantage this year. The track surface at the CoASTT was in better shape than the last time we visited, the weather was a little kinder, and, as always, familiarity counts. This bike also ran the optional quickshifter, something Rajini appreciated. It’ll set you back Rs 20,000 – not cheap by any stretch, especially on a sub-Rs 4 lakh machine – but it works well and really adds to the experience. Aprilia Tuono 457 ergonomics (6/10) Acessible seat height but cramped for tall riders. Like with the RS 457, the real gem remains the engine, and Aprilia’s 457cc parallel-twin continues to be the segment’s crown jewel. 48 horsepower and segment-leading torque only tell half the story. The motor is also very smooth, and it packs crisp throttle response and a rich and evocative sound. With that wide, sculpted tank between your legs and the bike’s superbike-like soundtrack, there’s a genuine sense of occasion every time you roll on the gas. That said, it’s not all roses. Ergonomics is where the Tuono 457 will leave taller riders wanting – especially on track. I found myself cramped against the rear seat bump stop, with the bike’s bodywork feeling particularly slippery. The already compact RS 457 felt more accommodating with its wide, more forward set clip-ons, but the Tuono’s setup makes the cockpit feel more restrictive. Some of this can easily be fixed by adding some grip tape and maybe by modifying the rear seat to allow the rider more room to slide back. But if you’re close to 6 feet tall, you will find this bike cramped – particularly in how the fuel tank recesses lock your knees in place – and that won’t be just at the race track. Aprilia Tuono 457 performance (9/10) Superb mid-range makes up for flat top-end and it makes a great sound. Beyond the hard metrics, the Tuono 457 is engaging, playful and, crucially, fast enough to make every session exciting. The aluminium chassis, firm suspension and impressive Eurogrip Pro Torque Xtreme tyres all come together to make this (along with the RS 457) probably the most impressive handling bike ever to be made in India.  Quickshifter is an impressive but expensive option CoASTT is a flowing circuit with few heavy braking zones, and while the 457’s front brake fade is a known issue, it wasn’t a problem here. That said, if you plan on hitting more tracks with more demanding braking zones, upgrading the pads, fluid, or master cylinder is something you’ll have to look into. Aprilia Tuono 457 handling (9/10) Chassis, suspension and tyres work well but brake fade needs to be addressed. What makes the Tuono so special is that it isn’t a detuned RS that trades capability for comfort. It carries the same spirit, the same capability, and nearly the same lap times. Unfortunately, it’s not all perfect. First, there’s the bike’s size and the fact that the design isn’t as evocative as the RS 457, which is more visually linked to its bigger siblings.  More worryingly, however, there have also recently been some customer reports of unexpected engine reliability issues, and this is something that Aprilia needs to address in a speedy and decisive manner. From a sheer capability standpoint, though, the Tuono 457 has exceeded expectations, and that’s not something that happens very often. Aprilia Tuono 457 verdict (9/10) Nearly as capable as the RS 457 and with considerably more seat comfort.  What really struck me is how this bike stacks up against the competition. Whether it’s KTM’s singles or Yamaha’s twin-cylinder offerings, the Tuono feels like it’s operating on a higher plane – especially on a fast circuit like CoASTT that rewards power and flow. In fact, the lap time is closer to more powerful bikes like the Suzuki GSX-8R and Ducati Hypermotard Mono than it is to rivals like the KTM 390 Duke and Yamaha R3.

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/2025-vinfast-vf7-review-350hp-awd-ev-with-a-spacious-back-seat-435668#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Car+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "The first product from Vietnamese EV maker Vinfast to be assembled and sold in India will be the VF7. The brand, which has a wide range of products positioned both above and below the VF7, has chosen this as the debut model for India as it wanted to enter a competitive segment, while also playing its premium card first. Some brief time with the model at Vinfast’s factory testing track in Hai Phong, Vietnam, gave us a better idea of how it could be positioned in our market, and suffice it to say, there’s more to it than first meets the eye. 2025 Vinfast VF7 exterior design and engineering – 7/10 Full of interesting details, but estate-like form factor lacks presence. A design signature of all Vinfast models is the moustache-like ‘V Face’ LED DRL band that sits on the nose and dips in the centre underneath the brand’s logo. Viewed head on, this does make many of their models look similar to one another, particularly this and the VF6, but look closer and you’ll see unique touches in each of them. V-face LED DRL band is the signature element bringing a family look to Vinfast EVs. The VF7 gets a pair of brushed metal ‘blades’ in the front air dam, while the bumper itself has an indented or concave look. In fact, this muscular surfacing can be found all over the car, and on the side, flush door handles help give the sculpted doors a clean look. For India, the VF7 will get 19-inch wheels, and ground clearance has been raised to 190mm. Only when viewed in profile do you realise this is a 4.5-metre-long vehicle with a 2.8-metre wheelbase, though the front and rear overhangs are quite short. Vertically oriented tail-lamps with interesting details look attractive. At the rear, there’s more sculpture to the tailgate, a slim windscreen and attractive vertically oriented LED tail-lamps. While the details are excellent, its long and low-slung shape means it doesn’t quite have the road presence of a boxy SUV, or even the coupe-like look of its smaller sibling the VF6, which could work against it in India, where a more traditional form factor is generally preferred. 2025 Vinfast VF7 interior space and comfort – 8/10 Big on rear seat and boot space, quality generally good too. While it might not look large on the road, it certainly is on the inside. Under the powered tailgate you’ll find a capacious 537-litre boot, although there is no spare tyre. Rear seat space should endear it to chauffeur-driven owners, because both leg and head room are vast. Due to the high floor, you’re sat a bit knees-up, but you don’t feel it as much when you’re stretched out. Rear seat leg and head room are both vast; gets a reclining feature, too.  Speaking of which, new for the Indian model is the ability to recline the rear seat back a generous amount, and the cushioning is soft and supportive, especially for the lower back. The windows are long but slim and set quite high, although the sense of space is greatly enhanced by the huge fixed glass roof that stretches from edge to edge. Interior is clean and uncluttered; infotainment screen is angled towards driver. Up front, the VF7 replaces the traditional instrument cluster with a heads-up display (plus essential info as a permanent fixture in the touchscreen) to give an uninhibited view over the low-set dashboard. The 12.9-inch touchscreen takes pride of place, angled proud of the dash with a set of drive-select toggle switches below it. This, combined with the light-coloured, soft-touch vegan leather trimming the dash and doors gives it a unique and premium look, albeit one without much flash value. Fit and finish are good, although some dull and basic looking plastics are a distraction. Soft-touch vegan leather trimming on dashboard gives a premium feel.    2025 Vinfast VF7 features and safety – 9/10 Loaded with features and targeting a 5 star Bharat NCAP score. Vinfast has chosen to only launch a single fully loaded trim level called Plus, in India, as a competitive feature set was deemed a high priority. Features like the aforementioned rear-seat recline, a wireless phone charger, vegan leather, ventilated seats and one-litre bottle holders in each door were said to be non-negotiables. Seven airbags are also standard, as are a host of electronic safety aids, including a radar-based ADAS suite with Level 2 Autonomous driving, all in the quest, Vinfast says, to achieve a 5-star Bharat NCAP rating. Other feature highlights include dual-zone climate control and the big glass roof. Small icons and graphics on the screen make it difficult to use on the move. While there are a few physical controls in the centre console and on the steering wheel, most functions are relegated to the touchscreen. Though this is a common practice these days, what makes Vinfast’s system less than ideal is the small size of the icons and graphics on the screen, which are difficult to target while on the move. 2025 Vinfast VF7 range and efficiency – 6/10 Large battery holds promise, but low WLTP rating is a concern. While there is only one trim level and one battery size for the VF7, it will be offered with two powertrain options – single-motor FWD and dual-motor AWD. The battery is a 70.8kWh LFP unit which can be charged at up to 7.2kW on an AC charger or on a CCS2 DC charger, although speeds and times were not specified for the latter. European-spec VF7 has a maximum WLTP-certified range of 450km. Vinfast says the Indian-spec car has had some tweaks to its powertrain and thus it’s best to wait for official MIDC or ARAI range figures. However, the WLTP rating for overseas models is rated at 450km for the FWD model and 431km for the AWD model. 2025 Vinfast VF7 performance and refinement – 9/10 AWD version offers addictive acceleration, modes alter character well. Vinfast VF7 specificationsLxWxH4545mm x 1890mm x 1635.75mmWheelbase 2840mmBattery capacity70.8kWhDrive layoutFWD/AWDMotor power204hp/350hpMotor torque 310Nm/500NmKerb weight 2090kg/2205kg0-100kph 9.5sec/5.8secAC charging Up to 7.2kWWheel size 245/50 R19 The Vinfast VF7 FWD model uses the same 204hp, 310Nm front-mounted motor as the VF6, which is claimed to get it to 100kph from a standstill in 9.5 seconds. However, the version we got to sample was the dual-motor version, which adds another similar motor on the rear axle. Total outputs for this version are 350hp and 500Nm, which shreds the 0-100kph sprint down to just 5.8sec. In practice, it feels genuinely fast, even spinning up its wheels under hard acceleration from low speeds. The ferocity of the power delivery starts to taper off close to about 120kph, but it will hold those speeds with ease. The good news is that it is civilised and manageable at low speeds, making it suitable for city driving too. The VF7 is genuinely fast, even spinning up its wheels under hard acceleration. Refinement was hard to judge on the relatively smooth expanse of Vinfast’s test track but the requisite electronic whine in the cabin was a welcome indicator of the power being deployed. The brakes felt strong and confidence inspiring, and the VF7 AWD’s not-inconsiderable 2.2-tonne mass was kept well in check. 2025 Vinfast VF7 ride comfort and handling – 8/10 Feels solid and confidence inspiring at high speeds. The dynamic capabilities of the VF7 were also hard to ascertain on the smooth track with almost no corners present. However, the general sense was of a secure and planted vehicle in the vein of what we’ve come to expect from European cars. The choice to move down a size from 20-inch to 19-inch wheels and tyres (Apollo tyres, no less) seems to have been the right one, as there is a degree of absorption that perhaps would have been lacking with the upsize. It feels secure and planted at high-speeds, almost European-like.  The longer wheelbase of the VF7 appeared to give it a greater sense of stability at high speeds than the VF6, if perhaps robbing it of a bit of handling playfulness in the process. That said, the drive modes did well to add (or remove) steering weight for the desired driving conditions. 2025 Vinfast VF7 price and verdict – 8/10 If priced aggressively, it could be a unique proposition in India. While the Vinfast VF7’s estate-like form factor might not be to everyone’s tastes, those seeking substance over style will appreciate it. The rear seat and boot are incredibly spacious, making this a great car for families or the chauffeur driven. Plus there’s the AWD version for those who like the occasional hit of performance on their Sunday drive. With local assembly from the get go, Vinfast is expected to go aggressive with the price, and we expect it to be in the region of Rs 25 lakh (ex-showroom) for the FWD version, going up to about Rs 29 lakh for the dual-motor AWD version. With the features and safety kit on offer, that should make it very competitive. Upon launch, prices are expected to range between Rs 25 lakh-29 lakh (ex-showroom). Whether in look, spec or character, the VF7 is a unique proposition for the Indian market, and perhaps that’s exactly what new entrant Vinfast needs to make people sit up and take notice. We’ll know more when the VF7 (followed closely by the VF6) goes on sale in India in the festive season of 2025.

    "description": "Mercedes-Benz India has revealed that luxury EVs are seeing wider adoption among Indian buyers. Year-on-year (YoY), luxury EV sales jumped 66 percent between January and May 2025, accounting for 11 percent of total luxury car sales in India, up from 7 percent during the same period in 2024. Mercedes-Benz records 76 percent surge in EV sales during Jan-May 2025 The German carmaker expects double-digit yearly growth in EV sales this year Luxury EVs are selling at a faster rate than mass-market EVs Mercedes-Benz luxury EV sales outpace overall market 76 percent YoY jump in EV sales during Jan-May 2025 Mercedes-Benz India recently reported a 76 percent year-on-year increase in EV sales during the first five months of 2025. As per monthly EV sales data obtained from the Vahan registration portal, Mercedes-Benz India has cumulatively sold 501 EVs in 2025 so far. Given this trajectory, the German carmaker is on course to exceed last year’s EV sales of 940 units. In terms of rankings, BMW currently sits at the top of the luxury EV sales charts, with Mercedes-Benz second and Volvo third. Factors driving luxury EV adoption Santosh Iyer, managing director and CEO of Mercedes-Benz India, stated that luxury EV sales growth in India is a result of improved charging infrastructures, greater public awareness and strategic product placement. He also noted that for some models, the price gap between ICE and EV counterparts can be as much as Rs 1 crore. This difference is largely due to policy-driven incentives and lower operational costs, making EVs more attractive to luxury car buyers. Luxury EV segment growing faster than mass market EVs on track to accrue major share in luxury arena EVs now constitute 11 percent of the luxury segment, compared to just 4 percent of the broader mass-market category. Iyer remarked that while EV adoption is not yet explosive, the month-on-month growth trend is “strong”. Challenges like currency volatility and economic uncertainty cloud the EV market in India, but even so, Mercedes-Benz expects it to record double-digit growth through 2025. The carmaker remains focused on the premium end of India’s EV market and believes that growing customer confidence and infrastructure expansion will drive further adoption. As it stands, Mercedes-Benz’s EV offerings in India comprise the G-Class Electric, EQS, EQB, EQA and EQE SUVs, as well as the EQS sedan; most of these are priced north of Rs 1 crore (ex-showroom).
