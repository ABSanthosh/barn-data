    "description": "This 2009 Ferrari 430 Scuderia Spider 16M is one of 499 examples produced to commemorate Ferrari’s 16 Formula One constructors’ championships. It was purchased new from Ferrari of Seattle in Washington, and has since accrued 2,800 miles in the Puget Sound region through the current and second owner's acquisition in October 2015. The Spider 16M is finished in Rosso Corsa with a center Livrea Tricolore stripe over Nero Alcantara and patterned cloth and is powered by a 4.3-liter DOHC V8 paired with a six-speed F1 automated transaxle. Further equipment includes a black convertible soft top, 19\" five-spoke alloy wheels, an electronically controlled limited-slip differential, Brembo carbon-ceramic brake rotors, carbon-fiber fender shields, carbon-fiber-framed seats, and automatic climate control. An April 2024 major service totaling over $44k included replacing the F1 hydraulic actuators, accumulators, pumps, and relays in addition to the gearbox ECU, rear main seal, and more. This F430 Scuderia Spider 16M is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with its Ferrari Classiche Red Book, a window sticker, owner's manual, Ferrari iPod Touch and dealer presentation folios, service records, a car cover, air compressor, battery tender, a clean Carfax report, and a Washington title in the owner's name.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/tesla-announces-cheaper-model-y-combat-sales-and-revenue-dive",
    "description": "US firm fights back after one of its worst ever quarters, caused by huge drops in sales and EV credit revenue Tesla will launch a cheaper variant of the Model Y in a bid to increase sales after posting one of its worst ever quarterly sales declines. In January, Tesla boss Elon Musk to launch a range of \"more affordable models\" by this summer in a bid to broaden its appeal. Rather than an entirely new model, this has instead amounted to a stripped-out version of the American EV brand's best-seller. Production is scheduled to begin from around August or September. Musk hasn't said whether other affordable models, such as a new Model 3, are planned. Nor has he provided more information, such as which markets the new Model Y would be sold in, target volumes or a target price. The current cheapest version of the SUV starts at £51,990. Tesla hopes the new base model wil especially help to incentivise sales in the US, where current $7500 government electric car grants are due to be stopped as part of president Donald Trump's rollback of emission mandates. The new model announcement has come after Tesla posted heavy losses in the second quarter of 2025. Musk warned that the trend is set to continue in what is expected to be one of Tesla's most challenging periods. The key pullout from the EV maker’s second quarter earnings, released on Wednesday night, was a 16% dip in income to $1.17 billion. Tesla blamed this on a 13% decline in sales, a reduction in its average model selling price and an increase in operating expenses. Most importantly, revenue from electric car credits, bought by other manufacturers to hit mandated emissions targets – which Tesla has hugely profited from previously – has dropped by 51% (or $441 million) since Q2 2024, including $154m since the previous quarter alone. This has been driven by Trump’s winding down of electric car regulations in the US, meaning car makers no longer need to hit certain EV production targets and therefore have no need to buy credits.   Announced in January, the revocation of former president Joe Biden’s legislation – which mandates that by 2030, 50% of all new cars sold in the US must be electric – is due to take effect in the coming months. As such, Musk told reporters on the earnings call that Tesla “probably could have a few rough quarters; I’m not saying we will, but we could”.  His comments resulted in share prices in the firm dropping 7%. This year has been difficult for Tesla. Despite introducing an updated version of the Model Y earlier this year, it has struggled in China – previously one of its most significant makerts – due to tariff tensions and sales drops linked to Musk's ties with Trump. While Tesla seemingly has no other mainstream models in the pipeline, a buoyant Musk said he expected a wave of revenue to come from the brand’s upcoming self-driving technology, such as its robotaxi service (currently being trailed in Texas) and vehicles such as the Cybercab. It has also invested heavily in the development of humanoid robots. “Once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I think I'd be surprised if Tesla's economics are not very compelling,” said Musk.",

The Kymco KTR 150 is a firm favorite among local workshops, as are the humble commuter machines from Hartford. Another nimble runabout has just emerged from under the radar: the Suzuki BS125. Manufactured in Taiwan during the 1980s and sold exclusively on the local market, the Suzuki BS125 was a single-cylinder, two-stroke motorcycle that quickly gained popularity among delivery riders. This 1985-model BS125 belongs to Chiu—a designer at the Taiwanese parts company Fangster, who also runs a multidisciplinary industrial design studio on the side under the handle ZEROVECTOR. The story of the ZEROVECTOR Suzuki BS125 goes back a decade, to when Chiu was still at university.…",

All lore aside, it’s the middle-age Evolution engine that’s credited with saving the brand, and while the Evo’s time has come and gone, there’s no denying that it continues to be a staple of the custom scene, especially in the Sportster platform. The Evolution built on the best bits of the outgoing, unit-construction Ironhead, and addressed performance and reliability concerns associated with the heavy cast-iron cylinders and heads. The 45-degree, air-cooled V-twin displaced 833, 1,100, and 1,200 cc across 30-plus years in production, and as a testament to the design, running examples of the Evo Sporter can be found everywhere these days for dirt cheap.…",

    "description": "The Aprilia SR line of scooters, especially the larger 150s and 160s, has been synonymous with sporty Italian design, fun demeanour and strong performance. What they have also been known for is their rather single-minded approach to performance and being priced on the higher side, more so in the BS6 era than ever. Enter the SR 175, Aprilia’s latest sporty scooter that aims to rectify some of these issues.  Aprilia SR 175 design and features - 8/10 Striking bodywork unchanged from before; gets two new colours The Aprilia SR 175’s sharp and angular bodywork is almost identical to the SR 160, and this design is now the better part of a decade old, but it still manages to turn heads and stand out in the sea of humdrum commuters on our roads. The SR 175 gets two new colours – white/red and purple/red – both of which are inspired by the RS 457 sportbike.  The SR's colour palette is the same as the RS 457's. While the design remains unchanged, what has seen a step up from before is the feature set. And all of that is primarily down to the crisp new 5-inch TFT display – also borrowed from the RS 457 – and brand-new switchgear to control all the functions. This colour TFT replaces the rather basic and dull-looking monotone LCD on the SR 160 and brings in things such as turn-by-turn navigation, call/message alerts, as well as music playback control once you connect your smartphone to the display via Aprilia’s proprietary app. The inclusion of this colour TFT dash now makes the Aprilia one of a handful of ICE scooters – besides TVS’ Jupiter 125 and Ntorq and Honda’s Activa and Dio models – to have this feature.   The 5-in colour TFT is borrowed from the RS 457 but has a new layout. The new dash is bright and can automatically switch between day and night modes, depending on ambient light. There are also two display modes, with all the above functions only available to use in the ‘Digital’ mode. I personally prefer the clean and uncluttered look of the ‘Analogic’ mode, which has a faux round speedometer and a needle. The overall UI/UX is fairly straightforward for nearly all functions, and no secret handshakes are needed here.  However, convenience-enhancing features, such as a multi-function ignition key slot, a cubby on the front apron, a brake-lock clasp, an external fuel filler and start/stop tech or even a quiet start, are missing. Boot space has never been an Aprilia SR’s forte, and the 175 is no different – you’ll struggle to get even an Indian half-face helmet in there.  Underseat storage not as spacious as that of a conventional scooter. Then, there are other issues specific to our test scooter. The side stand cut-off doesn’t seem to work, and a whine comes from the front wheel once you get rolling, which we feel appears to be down to a moving mechanical part that hasn’t been greased well. On what is a Rs 1.50 lakh scooter (on-road, Mumbai), these things will leave a customer wanting and reduce its feel-good factor.  Aprilia SR 175 performance and efficiency - 8/10 Packs in strong and eager performance; reasonably fuel-efficient, too But once you swing a leg over and start riding, the SR 175 will have you grinning ear to ear. It’s eager from the word go and is great fun accelerating away from stop lights and leaving traffic behind! Aprilia has enlarged the SR 160’s engine to create this new 174.7cc mill, which makes 12.9hp at 7,200rpm and 14.14Nm of torque at 6,000rpm – a discernible step up from the previous 11.27hp at 7,100rpm and 13.44Nm at 5,300rpm.  EngineEngine174.70cc, single-cyl, air-cooledPower12.9hp at 7,200rpmTorque14.14Nm of torque at 6,000rpm The power delivery, while strong, is smooth as well as predictable, and younger riders will benefit from that. There’s no sudden surge of power, and it has a measured yet strong pull all the way to a speedo-indicated 90kph. The SR 175's riding experience in a nutshell: fun! In our tests, the SR 175 was quite close to the Yamaha Aerox 155 in the sprint to 60kph, after which the more powerful Japanese scooter starts increasing the gap. This is commendable performance from the Aprilia’s simpler 3-valve, air-cooled engine, and what also pleasantly surprised us was its fuel efficiency. It returned an impressive 41.7kpl out on the highway and a decent 35.2kpl inside the city. For the sort of engine this is and the performance on tap, these numbers are commendable.  PerformanceAcceleration0-40kph2.76s0-60kph5.69sRoll-on acceleration20-50kph2.88s30-70kph6.37s50-80kph7.37s The Aprilia SR’s engine has always been a gruff thing, and while that character continues onto the 175, its refinement isn’t a dealbreaker. There is some juddering below 20kph, especially so with small or constant throttle inputs, but once you open the taps, this engine becomes reasonably smooth with just a mild tingle in the floorboard. Our scooter had less than 500km on the odo, so perhaps this could improve after performing the first service.  Aprilia SR 175 ergonomics and comfort - 7/10 It can feel tight for bigger riders; suspension is firm, not harsh Focused and sporty scooters like this can’t match the outright comfort and spacious nature of mainstream practical offerings. The Aprilia SR 175 follows that theme to some extent, but it isn’t as single-minded as its predecessors. Its sloped rider’s seat, which forces you to adjust your seating position every so often, continues into 2025, and it isn’t the most spacious or well-padded unit around. But its suspension comfort has proven to be an area of surprise.  Fuel economyCity35.21kplHighway41.78kplOverall38.50kpl The first day of riding the SR 175 entailed going from Andheri in Mumbai’s western suburbs to Panvel East. Traversing the breadth of the monsoon-ravaged city, I’m happy to say that the SR’s suspension kept me reasonably comfortable as I encountered an unceasing barrage of road imperfections. Of course, it’s still a sporty scooter with taut suspension, but it’s not as downright uncomfortable as the Aerox. The sloping seat forces you to reposition yourself every so often. The SR 175 is quite a tall thing by scooter standards, and while I, at 5’11”, didn’t have any issues with flat-footing it, I foresee that to be a challenge for anyone under 5’7”. Riders with bigger feet will also wish for a little more room on the floorboard, as I felt my feet had little wiggle room and felt quite locked in place. I wear size 12 shoes, so I’m on the larger end of the spectrum, and this is a subjective thing.  Aprilia SR 175 ride and handling - 7/10 14-inch wheels lend stability and confidence when leaned over Sporty handling and surefooted manners at high speeds have always been the Aprilia SR line-up’s forte, and the 175 happily continues that trend. The large 14-inch wheels shod with chunky 120-section rubber inspire loads of confidence when chucking the SR 175 into a bend, and the scooter stays planted no matter the size of the bump on the road. Vee Rubber tyres are rather average in the wet. These Vee Rubber tyres are rather average, however, and Aprilia also offers MRF and CEAT as tyre suppliers, both of which fare better in terms of grip and feedback, although what your scooter comes equipped with is entirely a game of luck.  BrakingBraking (60-0kph)19.18m Stopping performance, too, is superb, and it feels like this scooter wants you to brake like you’re on a motorcycle. The front brake has a strong yet progressive bite and shoulders the majority of the load, with the rear drum brake mainly there to keep you steady. Just like the SR 160, the SR 175 comes with a single-channel ABS as standard, and while this safety feature works well for the most part, it feels like it intervenes a little too early when you clamp down hard on the binders and robs you of power. The 14-inch wheels lend the SR a motorcycle-like planted feel. Aprilia SR 175 price and verdict - 8/10 A lot more scooter for not a lot more money  By now, we’ve established that the SR 175 is a perceivable step up over its predecessor. Happily, you get this improved experience without having to pay extra, and in Mumbai, the SR 175’s ex-showroom price is Rs 1.26 lakh, which is more or less on par with the top SR 160’s asking price. Considering that there’s really no petrol scooter in this space (the Yamaha Aerox now costs over Rs 1.50 lakh), the Aprilia SR 175 makes a rather compelling case for itself.  The SR 175 sits in a class of its own in terms of price. Its performance and sporting ability are attributes few other scooters can match. Its striking good looks and fancy TFT display add to its allure, and it isn’t entirely impractical. Areas of improvement are more to do with the company rather than the product itself – a small Aprilia dealer network limits availability, and service will generally be more expensive and quite likely not as frictionless as for scooters from other brands.   PricePrice (ex-showroom, Mumbai)Rs 1.26 lakh However, if you’re willing to look past that, the Aprilia SR 175 is a thoroughly enjoyable scooter at a fair price that will stand out in the crowd.",

    "description": "What we have here is Kia’s first mass market EV for India. Lo and behold, it's not an SUV/crossover. It’s called the Kia Carens Clavis EV and the name spells out what it is – an all-electric version of the Clavis. The experience, as you’ll learn, is familiar yet different. Kia Carens Clavis EV exterior design and engineering - 8/10 Subtle tweaks help distinguish Clavis EV from its ICE sibling. A green number plate will be the biggest indicator that the Carens Clavis you are looking at is indeed the EV version. Kia hasn’t tinkered with the MPV’s design in any way but there are some EV-specific style tweaks. Kia hasn't tinkered much with the MPV's design on this EV version. The light bar above the grille glows (it doesn’t on petrol/diesel versions), the charging flap sits at the centre of the nose, while the revised bumper is home to active aero elements (they open/close as needed), ‘ice cube’-look fog lamps and a redone scuff plate. The EV’s bonnet also lifts to reveal a 25-litre frunk, which can be used to stow charging cables. An aero-optimised look for the 17-inch wheels is also unique to the Clavis EV while the changes at the back are limited to the new EV badging. 17-inch alloys get a new aero-optimised design. Under the skin, the Kia Carens Clavis EV has much in common with the Hyundai Creta Electric. Like the Creta Electric, the Clavis EV positions its battery pack in the wheelbase. On offer are 42kWh and 51.4kWh battery pack versions, with the former paired with a 135hp/255Nm motor and the latter a more powerful 171hp/255Nm unit; both are front-mounted and front wheel-drive. Kia Carens Clavis EV interior space and comfort - 8/10 Well packaged battery means no compromise in space or seating comfort. If you’ve been in a Clavis, you’ll be at home in a Clavis EV. The basic look inside is shared with a smartly finished dash sporting a twin-screen arrangement. The EV does distinguish itself with a floating look for the console between the front seats. The console serves as an armrest, packs in cupholders and is also home to buttons for features like seat ventilation. There’s open storage below it, and in general, the cabin has an airy feel. Interior remains largely unchanged from Clavis except for a new floating centre console design. Getting in and out of the Clavis EV is easy and drivers will like their seat for comfort and adjustability – the seats get partial power adjust while the steering adjusts for rake and reach. The steering itself is nice to hold with nice paddles and a chunky drive mode selector button.  What’s nice is how well the battery pack has been accommodated in the body. The middle row seating position doesn’t feel too different to the ICE versions’, so you don’t get that knees-up position we’ve come to expect in EVs that position their battery pack under the floor. The middle row is comfy and scores really well on flexibility. The middle row is comfy and scores really well on flexibility. The seats split 60:40, can be slid back and forth and also get generous backrest recline. There’s also a powered adjust to move the front passenger seat forward to free up more room for the boss seat. Do note, the Clavis EV is only offered in 7-seat form and doesn’t get the option of captain’s chairs for the middle row. Getting to the third row is an easy affair thanks to a one-touch powered seat fold function that opens up a large walk through. The rearmost seats are suitable for average-sized adults and it's easy to work out a space compromise with the middle seat passengers. Third row seats are adequate for two average-sized adults. With all seats up, there’s space for a few soft bags in the boot. The third and second rows can be folded flat to create more luggage room as required. Kia Carens Clavis EV performance and refinement - 8/10 Performance is brisk and there’s ample pulling power even when loaded. Kia Carens Clavis EV specsStandard Extended Range Battery 42kWh 51.4kWh Drive layout Front, single motor Front, single motor Power 135hp 171hp Torque 255Nm 255Nm Featured here is the Clavis EV in its larger battery and more powerful Extended Range guise. Like other EVs, the experience in the cabin is quiet. There is little you hear of the motor up front and even road and wind noise are well contained. Even at part throttle, the Clavis EV has a nice reserve of power. MPVs aren’t typically about performance so you’ll be pleasantly surprised by the Clavis EV’s build of speed. Kia claims an 8.4-second 0-100kph time, which is suitably brisk. There’s a strong pull should you press down on the accelerator and this, for instance, makes overtaking very easy. There’s ready power even at part throttle and you’ll rarely, if ever, need to dial up to Sport mode. The default Normal setting works just fine and even Eco is more than sufficient for everyday commutes. There’s enough poke even with all three rows occupied and even the climb up to Nandi Hills was easy going for the Clavis EV. Kia Carens Clavis EV efficiency/range - 7/10 Carens Clavis EV has an official range of up to 490km. Kia Carens Clavis EV range and chargingStandard Extended Range Battery 42kWh 51.4kWh Claimed range (ARAI)404km 490km 11kW AC charging (10-100%)4 hours 4 hours 45 mins DC charging (10-100%)39mins39mins The Carens Clavis EV with the 42kWh battery pack has an official range of 404km while the larger 51.4kWh battery pack boasts a 490km official range figure. Over our test drive, the Clavis EV Extended Range delivered a real-world figure in the region of 320-350km (depending on mode). The caveat here is that our drive route included a run up to Nandi Hills, and inclines really sap battery charge. We’ll wait to test the Clavis EV in Mumbai on our efficiency test loop before delivering final judgement on how far it can go on a full charge. Extended Range variant has an ARAI-certified range of 490km. The Clavis EV supports DC charging at up to 100kW that enables a 10-80 percent charge in 39 minutes. Worth highlighting is that Kia is establishing a network of these fast chargers at its dealerships for times when you need a quick top up charge. Ultimately, it’s the spread of high-speed chargers pan India that will determine how far and freely you can travel with a Carens EV. For the majority of owners, a 11kW AC charger (supplied with the car) set up at home or your work place will be the go to solution to juice up the Clavis EV’s battery pack. A 10-100 percent charge takes 4 hours for the 42kWh version and 4 hours and 45 minutes for the 51.4kWh version. Kia Carens Clavis EV ride comfort and handling - 7/10 Easy-to-drive demeanour complemented by pleasant ride comfort. We’ve always liked the Carens (and now Clavis) for its friendly manners and that’s no different on the Clavis EV. For one, the Clavis EV doesn’t intimidate anyone upgrading from a smaller vehicle. The light steering, great visibility and the crisp cameras help to this end.  There's a slight hint of firmness, but ride comfort is good overall.  Kia has retuned the suspension to deal with the added weight of the battery pack, and it’s a job well done. Ride comfort is good for the most part, and it's only when getting off sharp speedbreakers that you’ll notice the Clavis EV slam down on its springs before settling quickly. You’ll feel a hint of firmness if you really pay attention to the happenings beneath. The Clavis EV offers 200mm of unladen ground clearance and the body or battery pack didn't make contact with the ground even over broken patches. At higher speeds, the Clavis EV feels composed and surefooted. Despite the battery pack sticking out, it didn't make any contact with the ground on our drive. Braking performance is also good with reassuring stopping power. Regen braking that uses the motor to slow the vehicle down, and feed some of the recovered energy back to the battery, is part of the package. Regen strength can be toggled via paddleshifters and there are four settings: off, mild, mid and strong. You get one-pedal driving (ability to bring the car to a halt using regen) in the strongest setting, though the drop in speed towards the end could be more urgent. What’s nice is how well the regen works with ADAS functions like adaptive cruise control to modulate speed.  Kia Carens Clavis EV price and verdict - 8/10 Pricey at the top end but an EV that fits the bill for large families. The Clavis EV is a very likeable product offering. It has all that we like about the Clavis and all that we like about EVs in one competent package. High mileage users (as many MPV owners tend to be), in particular, will be tempted by the move to electric given the savings in running costs. There is a price to pay, though, and that is in upfront costs. The Clavis EV is the only three-row EV in the Rs 20 lakh-25 lakh price range. Kia has launched the Clavis EV at Rs 17.99 lakh with the range-topping version featured here priced at Rs 24.49 lakh (ex-showroom). That’s Rs 3 lakh over a similarly equipped Carens Clavis turbo-petrol with a DCT. Incentives and registration benefits on EVs do reduce the on-road price delta, at least for the moment. Thing is, there’s no other 7-seat EV at this price point. The only other 3-row EV is BYD’s eMax 7 that costs a few lakhs more. The Clavis, then, is actually an alternative to the increasing number of electric SUV options in the Rs 20 lakh-25 lakh band. For anyone keen on an EV and with regular use for three rows, the Clavis EV is really the only choice. And a very good one indeed.

    "description": "India and the United Kingdom signed the landmark Free Trade Agreement (FTA) today, about a month and a half after the trade deal was announced. The FTA was formalised in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his British counterpart Keir Starmer. India’s commerce minister, Piyush Goyal, was also present at the formal signing ceremony. India-UK FTA: how it benefits new car buyers In May, the two governments had announced that as part of the FTA, India would reduce tariffs on “high-end cars” imported from the UK from about 110 percent to just 10 percent. This has now been signed off on. However, a quota still has to be set for the number of UK-made models that can be imported at the reduced tariff rate. This would mean that buyers of premium and luxury cars made in the UK are expected to pay a much lower price for their imported model. Which carmakers will benefit from the FTA? Among the carmakers that will benefit from price reductions across their respective portfolios are Aston Martin, Bentley, JLR  and Rolls-Royce, all of which manufacture in the UK and import select models to India. Mini India, which imports the Cooper from the UK, had already announced a price protection programme meant to pass on the benefits of any reduction in the Mini 3-Door’s price.

    "description": "The provisional calendar for the 2026 MotoGP season has been revealed. However, there is no mention of the Indian GP. MotoGP commercial rights holder Dorna had stated last year that the return of the Indian GP had been postponed to 2026 due to “operational circumstances”, but this hasn’t materialised. 2025 Indian GP was cancelled due to “operational circumstances” 2026 MotoGP calendar features 22 rounds Indian GP not part of 2026 MotoGP calendar MotoGP’s India return hits another roadblock MotoGP made its India debut at the F1 Indian GP’s former home, the Buddh International Circuit, back in 2023. Despite operational issues and scorching hot temperatures, the track itself earned praise from several riders. The race was set to return and was originally a part of the 2024 calendar as well. But it was later cancelled and pushed to March 2025, with the official reason cited as “weather concerns”. However, reports at the time suggested that promoter Fairstreet Sports had not paid the full hosting fee to Dorna on time. Fairstreet Sports had denied this, stating that Dorna was aware that payments would be delayed due to the upcoming General Elections. Just weeks later, though, Dorna signed a new 3-year deal directly with the Uttar Pradesh government, removing Fairstreet Sports from the picture entirely. In August 2024, the government issued a tender to find a new race promoter, but this was later recalled and reissued in September 2024. Finally, in late September, Dorna confirmed that the Indian had been dropped from the 2025 calendar as well. However, the statement at the time stressed that the Indian GP would return in 2026.         View this post on Instagram                       A post shared by Autocar India (@autocar_india) “Operational circumstances have obliged the event to be delayed from its initial slot near the start of the 2025 calendar. With no available dates towards the end of the season, MotoGP will therefore return to India in the early stages of 2026,” the statement said. “Both MotoGP and InvestUP are working hard to bring MotoGP back to Buddh International Circuit with a world-class event and are committed to confirming India as a destination for global sporting events.” Despite the promises, there’s no mention of India in the 2026 MotoGP calendar announcement. Given India’s tumultuous history of hosting international motorsport events (just look at F1 and Formula E), the success of the India MotoGP round was crucial. No reason for the cancellation of the race has been shared as of yet, but Autocar India has reached out to Dorna and is awaiting a response. Also see: Mahindra wants to stay Formula E manufacturer",
