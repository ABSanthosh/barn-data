    "title": "Quack on: Bringing Jeep Ducking to the UK with a Wrangler",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/quack-bringing-jeep-ducking-uk-wrangler",
    "description": "A North American trend called Duck Duck Jeep is said to be hitting the UK. What on Earth is it? Like many waterfowl, ducks are migrating birds - but some recent new arrivals on UK shores will have even seasoned twitchers very confused. Because reports suggest that you might just find a new species of duck in the UK If, that is, you know where to look: the dashboards of Jeeps. I should mention we're talking plastic ducks here. That's because a relatively new phenomenon has begun in which Jeep drivers - or Jeepers, as some like to style themselves - gift plastic ducks to the owners of other Jeeps. Don't worry: you're probably not alone in finding that odd. Ducking Jeeps - please be careful how you say that - has become hugely popular in North America. Find a Jeep of any type, age or condition over there, and you're likely to see at least a handful of ducks spread across its dashboard. I discovered the phenomenon on a holiday in Texas when Avis gave me a Wrangler PHEV hire car. One day I returned to it in a car park to find a small blue duck - which neatly matched the accent colour on the bodywork details - on the wing mirror. It took a bit of internet sleuthing to unearth why I'd been gifted a plastic duck and my quest to learn more led me down a rabbit hole. Or duck hole, I suppose. According to various Jeep ducking web forums, the trend is beginning to spread globally, including to the UK. Is that true? There was only one way to find out: to get a Wrangler and a bag full of plastic ducks (official Jeep ones, no less) and to set out on a duck hunt. Yes, serious investigative journalism, this. But before we get to the mechanics of Jeep ducking, you probably want to know where it came from and how it started. And, like so many nice, pleasant and polite things, it originally began in Canada. It started as an impulsive gesture by a Canadian called Allison Parliament. She lived in Alabama, in the US Deep South, but in July 2020 she needed to return to Ontario to care for her ill grandmother. Given the challenges of travelling at the height of the Covid pandemic, she made the 1000-mile-plus trek in her beloved Jeep Wrangler. But at a petrol stop shortly after entering Canada, then under strict social-distancing restrictions, the Alabama plates on her car attracted the ire of a man, who verbally abused and shoved her, telling her to leave Canada. The encounter troubled Parliament for the rest of her drive and subsequent enforced quarantine. When her isolation was over, she decided to cheer herself up by buying some rubber ducks. The original plan was to keep them to hide around her partner’s house as a prank. But then Parliament spotted another Jeep and she wanted to do something to make the owner smile. “A compliment on your Jeep is always a good feeling,” she told the website of insurer Hagerty. Except Parliament didn’t have any paper to hand. But she did have ducks. So she scribbled ‘Nice Jeep, have a great day’ on one and decided to leave it on the bonnet. However, the owner spotted her and ran over to find out what she was doing. When she explained, “he thought it was a great thing, said it made his day”, recounted Parliament. They decided Parliament should put a pic on social media with the hashtag #duckduckjeep. She then decided to do the same with the rest of the ducks, to spread more cheer. And it spread fast: within weeks, the official Duck Duck Jeep Facebook page had gained tens of thousands of followers and she was soon being asked to do newspaper interviews about the fast-growing trend.  During a hugely difficult time, it was a wonderfully escapist bit of fun. But, unlike other pandemic trends such as baking sourdough and doing PE in your living room, Jeep ducking didn't end when lockdowns eased. Instead it kept growing.  Four years later, it’s grown into a genuine phenomenon that is celebrated at Jeep events and sports its own mini-industry. Peek on the Duck Duck Jeep Facebook group and you'll find discussion about what sort of ducks to put on particular Jeeps, advice on how to best stick ducks to dashboards (duck tape appears to be a popular answer), and even links to special lights to illuminate your dashboard ducks. It all seems incredibly daft, in a pleasantly twee Canadian sort of way. I want in. But as I settle into the Wrangler's seat, dashboard dotted with ducks, I'm not really sure where to start. After all, the general spirit of the thing is that ducking is a random, opportunist activity. Instead, I need to go out and find Jeeps. But where to look? With some cars, it's easy. You'll find Kia Sportages dotted around almost any supermarket car park. For a Tesla, just head to a Supercharger. Defender 130? That's easy: London's Kensington High Street. But Jeep? You'd hope to find Wranglers blasting down off-road trails, but plenty are bought for 'lifestyle' reasons. And you're more likely to stumble across an Avenger on the school run than a green lane. There's another problem: scarcity. Much like the greater scaup, with its distinctive plumage and mating call, Jeeps are a relatively rare spot on these shores. Even with the huge success of the Avenger, the brand's UK market share last year was 0.43%. Taking inspiration from ducks, I head to the river, mostly because snapper John Bradshaw knows a good spot to get some duck-filled pics. The fowl that usually line this section of the Thames have headed somewhere warmer, though, so we have to settle for the plastic variety. But there's early success: on our way to the photoshoot location, we pass a parked Renegade. However, the light is good and John wants to do the photos now, so we don't stop. By the time I return, armed with a plastic duck, the Jeep has gone. So begins a frustrating hunt. I see several Jeeps driving in the other direction - including another Wrangler, whose driver gives me a friendly wave - but that's no good: I can't exactly throw ducks at them from the window of a moving car. I resort to a trawl of south-west London car parks, including several laps around one attached to a Tesco Extra. Still. I can at least enjoy driving the Wrangler. It's a Sahara-spec car, so the lower of the trim levels available in the UK, although still well-appointed for a machine whose roots stretch back to a military utility vehicle. And while the 2.0-litre engine is a bit on the gruff side and the ride can be a touch wobbly in places, it's surprisingly pleasant to drive around town in. People also seem to like it, which definitely isn't true of every beefed-up SUV you'll find barging through cities. Perhaps it helps that my car is sporting bright Firecracker Red paint, but it attracts plenty of second glances. Or perhaps people are just trying to work out why my dashboard is covered with plastic ducks. But this isn't about the Jeep I'm driving: it's about finding others. At last, after resorting to trawling up and down residential streets in Twickenham with increasing desperation I spot one. It's a Renegade rather than a Wrangler sure, but it's a Jeep. Finally, it's time to go ducking. The unofficial rules of Duck Duck Jeep give some guidance for duckers: never put a duck inside a vehicle, always leave it somewhere visible and, if you're going to write a message on it, keep it clean. I decide to balance the duck on the wing mirror. Doing so is the work of a moment, and after such a long hunt, it's all a bit anticlimactic. My journalistic instinct is to hang around until the owner returns to find the duck. I want to know if they've heard of the trend, what they think about it and so on. But that runs against the spirit of the thing: the key is the unexpected discovery for the recipient. It's their moment, not mine. I settle for attaching a note to the duck (on paper, rather than trying to write on the duck itself), inviting the owner to get in touch if they want to know more about ducks. Then it's back into the Wrangler and off. And then I turn the corner at the end of the street and there's another Jeep: an ageing Patriot this time. Another duck and note is deposited. Halfway down the street, there's another one. Over the next few days, I find several more Jeeps and each time deposit a duck. Every time I do, there's a little hit of endorphin that comes from doing something nice, even if that's slightly tempered by the occasional strange glance from passers-by. It's hard not to feel self-conscious when you're a grown man sticking plastic ducks on cars. What's notable is that I don't see a single duck on the dashboard of another Jeep: it seems the Duck Duck Jeep trend really is in its infancy over here. Nor does anyone get in touch in response to my notes. Perhaps it's early days, or perhaps we Brits are just a bit too reserved for this sort of thing. Or maybe the relative scarcity of Jeeps here will make it a more low-key, cult thing. To find out, you'll have to keep staring at the dashboards of Jeeps. Sadly, in June this year Parliament, the accidental invention of the trend, died suddenly from natural causes. Her mother encouraged Jeep owners to keep on ducking, and the continued growth of the trend seems a wonderful, if unusual, legacy for her to leave. In an increasingly polarised society, it's a truly rare thing: a spontaneous, joyous random act of kindness. Am I reading too much into the act of sticking a plastic novelty on a car? Perhaps. Maybe my hunt has made me mad. But I've still got a pile of ducks and there are car parks left to scan. It turns out being nice is quite addictive.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/why-we-finally-love-toyota-supra-just-it-gets-axe",
    "description": "Occasionally it takes time for a car's virtues to become apparent. Why? I'm not so sure... With a limited-run Final Edition special, the Toyota GR Supra is about to depart this earthly realm, nearly six years after it was launched early in 2019 at the Detroit motor show. It doesn’t seem like six years to me, even though Toyota had been talking about building a new Supra since 2012, we saw prototypes in 2018 and in September 2019 I drove a still-disguised pre-production ‘A90’. Perhaps it’s my age, but it still seems like the Supra hasn’t long arrived, and yet with a 429bhp special, away it goes. Not that it was that easy to buy one in the UK later in its life anyway. This market was granted a small annual allocation of cars and the Supra was in and out of Toyota’s price lists as a result. The Final Edition is limited to 300 examples globally, and it’s not year clear how many the UK will get. But it brings with it a serious number of changes: extra power, adjustable KW dampers from a GT4 track variant, new drilled brake discs, an Akrapovic exhaust, baffles in the sump to prevent oil starvation, extra body bracing, exterior aerodynamic addenda and some incredibly uncomfortable-looking seats. Sounds like a proper circuit weapon. But even though it seems (to me) like the Supra has been around for no time at all, my attitude towards it has shifted markedly – totally unlike, say, how I feel about the Alpine A110, which hasn’t had too dissimilar a lifespan. I loved the A110 at launch and still love it the same way now. (Incidentally, while the A110 is still around, its non-compliance with the EU’s General Safety Regulations 2 means Alpine can sell no more than 1500 across Europe per year. Why hasn’t the UK exempted itself from this? Why aren’t we marching on parliament to demand more A110s?)  Meanwhile, the Supra is a car that I think I like more now than when in 2019 our road test found “it left us wanting more”.  It was something of a ‘not quite’ car: not quite an A110, not quite a Porsche 718 Cayman. Good but perhaps the least satisfying of the group of cars that all decided they might be able to take on the Porsche all at the same time. Today I’m more sold on the general attitude of the Supra than ever. I don’t want ‘more’ than the ordinary one, with a six-cylinder engine, an automatic gearbox and whatever else it came with at the time. While it has a 51:49 weight distribution (remember, the platform is shared with the BMW Z4) and it’s a quick coupé and surely it’s agile enough, it cuts a relatively relaxed vibe when you’re driving one. And I’m here for that. As a future classic car, it has bags of appeal, in my view. I think some cars do get more appealing as they age, and as yet I haven’t put my finger on exactly why. But sports cars that weren’t class-leading at the time but seem more mellow now are certainly chief among them. A mate has an early Mercedes-Benz SLK, far from the world’s greatest roadster new, but he loves it as a summer cruiser, and I get it. The other week, I drove around parts of the US where it’s common for people to park a car by the side of busier roads with ‘for sale’ signs in the windows. I mostly saw run-down muscle cars, old pick-up trucks and scabby 4x4s. All were surely pretty dreadful to drive, yet it would almost be worth moving there just to be able to buy and daily any of them. Plus, I think in the Supra’s case, as is the way with many other Japanese sports cars, the lack of an immediate replacement brings an extra sense of loss. There were decades between Honda NSXs, there’s no Toyota MR2 or Celica at the moment, nor is there a Honda S2000 and nor can you buy a rotary-engined Mazda coupé. The Japanese seem more comfortable with hiatuses coming between models. Maybe they knew to appreciate the Supra more when it was around, rather than just when it looked like it was going.",

Then there are craftsmen who can apply their distinct art to any canvas, without compromise. Kengo Kimura of Heiwa MC is one such artisan. Based in Hiroshima, Kimura-san is one of the leading lights in the Japanese custom scene. His custom bikes are recognizable for their elegant tapered silhouettes, and the way each part harmonizes with the next. Most of his projects use older models as donors, but he’s just as adept at modifying new bikes—as evidenced by this handsome 2024-model custom Triumph Scrambler 900. What’s remarkable is how much Kengo’s been able to manipulate the modern Triumph to suit his vision.…",

They’re usually existing models, upgraded with fancy liveries and, in some cases, numbered plaques. But the fact that they come out twice a decade (and in strong numbers) sort of diminishes their allure. It’s little wonder, then, that the owner of this 100th Anniversary Harley Springer Softail had no qualms about handing it over to our man in Taiwan, Winston Yeh, for a Rough Crafts makeover. As implied, the 2003-model Harley-Davidson Springer Softail followed The Motor Co.’s typical Softail formula, with a vintage-style springer front end added to the mix.

    "description": "Only here for three quick months that flew by in a flash, the Punch EV didn’t feel like a ‘long’ termer in the same way most of our others do. That is partly due to the fact that it frequently changed hands within the team since everyone wanted to have some time with it, and thus, no one ever used it for a long enough spell. On a less favourable note, it’s also because we’ve actually had two Punch EVs in the fleet, as Tata gave us a temporary replacement car when it took this one in for inspection after it threw up a critical alert in its first week with us, and would not start. Once it was back, the error never showed again, though it was not without other electronic gaffes, such as the camera feeds sometimes going blank, the infotainment system freezing, wireless charging stopping frequently, and my phone being regularly booted out of Android Auto. They really need to address these software gremlins soon. I’m also not a fan of how it has an auditory alert for… everything! Changing drive modes, engaging the parking brake, and even leaving the rear seatbelts unfastened (even without passengers) fires off some form of annoying alert. Show, don’t tell, Tata Motors. No rear load sensors means seat belt warning beeps unless buckled at all times. More time behind the wheel has allowed me to dig into the nuances of the powertrain a bit more. Mixing it up with other EVs, I’ve found Tata’s Acti.ev architecture could do with a bit more refinement. No, I don’t mean the NVH levels (those are excellent), but rather the control weights, brake blending and power delivery. It can feel abrupt and erratic as you move from accelerating to coasting to braking, and with the rapid rate at which EVs are evolving, there are others that now do it more seamlessly.  It’s not, however, enough to take away from the fact this is a great all-round package – and that’s before you even consider its price or its compact and convenient size. I’ve loved my commutes to work in it and the ability to park in the tiniest of spots – an essential trait for a car in Mumbai. Plus, it goes like hell if you want it to and has an almost uncanny ability to absorb even the harshest of bumps at any speed. While I’m far from the most efficient driver, even I managed a superb 6.9km/kWh in the Punch EV. But my colleague Lokesh from our Hindi channel WhatCar? India managed 8.5! The battery may not be huge, but you can really rinse out every cell in this car. Good design, light colours give it a premium feel inside. Perhaps the brevity of its tenure has also afforded me a greater appreciation of its light-coloured interior since I’m not the one who’s going to have to get it detailed every second month. When it’s clean, though, the effect it has is tremendous – as if it’s trickled down directly from Tata-owned Range Rover. Even the steering wheel is dual-tone leatherette-wrapped, grey and cream, which is a bold choice in an entry-level EV, and then there’s the liberal use of gloss black plastic that looks great, though it is prone to smudges, scratches and reflections. Helpful battery, charging data on screens (when they work). There is a sense with this car, and a lot of Tata models if I’m honest, that design comes first and foremost, whether inside or out, and I like that. The brand’s family aesthetic runs through the Punch EV, and it extends not just to the bodywork and upholstery but also to the screen graphics. Yes, those screens may glitch, and the text is too small in places, but boy, do they look good! They’re colourful, clean, and actually pack in a good amount of data and features. Tata’s EV reign may have plateaued – the MG Windsor even took the top spot on the sales charts – but that appears more a function of market trends. The brand does need to sort out its electric and electronic gremlins immediately, which is something that’s plaguing the ICE models, too. Because once they do, the model range on offer is nothing short of impressive, and it’s only growing. As I’ve said before, there are bigger, better Tata EVs, but the Punch EV is a concentrated distillation of everything the brand has done so far. Will we have another electric Tata in our fleet soon? I hope so. Also see: Tata Punch EV long term review, 7,000km report Tata Punch EV review: Feels like a mini-Nexon EV",

    "description": "After Ather debuted Magic Twist and traction control on the 450 Apex, they trickled down to the family-centric Rizta. Now, the company has endowed the 450X with the same, and also peppered it with other small changes. Ather 450X changes for 2025, new features Unlike the Rizta, where the systems are simply on or off, the ones on the 450X are adjustable. Magic Twist has two levels – Low and High – while traction control has three – Rain, Road and Rally – and both can be turned off entirely as well. Both TC and Magic Twist can be switched off entirely. I’ve been using Magic Twist on our Rizta long-termer for a few months now, and I find it to be a useful, intuitive feature on my commutes. I think the adjustability of this feature on the 450X only exemplifies its usefulness. In chock-a-block traffic, I preferred to leave the Magic Twist in Low, which helped reduce the aggressiveness of the regen. It was still effective enough to bring the scooter to a halt without using the brakes.  The Magic Twist has also brought with it an added bonus – a big claimed increased range. For the 2.9kWh 450X variant, Ather claims that TrueRange has gone up from 85km to 105km, and that of the 3.7kWh variant has seen an even larger increment, from 105km to 130km. In the short time frame of this first ride experience, we weren’t able to put these claims to the test, so we’ll reserve our judgement until we can conduct a thorough road test in Mumbai.  Some of the aforementioned range increase is also attributed to the new Zapper N e-tred tyres, co-developed by both MRF and Ather. Ather claims these tyres have lower rolling resistance, thereby helping increase the scooter’s range. The company also claims that there’s a minuscule trade-off in grip, but it’s nothing I felt during my time with the 450X. Visually, these are identical to the earlier MRF Zapper tyres and have the exact same tread pattern; the difference lies purely in how they are constructed. New tyres help increase range, look the same. When it comes to traction control, I found myself leaving the scooter in Rally mode for almost the entirety of my time with it. Rally allows a fair bit of slip on loose surfaces before it reins the scooter in, letting you have fun while keeping you safe. Even when I was riding in Warp mode over some properly rough surfaces, it worked smoothly in the background. The other two modes are more cautious, for those of you who don’t like getting ‘Swayze’ every now and then. The final change is the obvious one: new colours. You’ve got this bold Hyper Sand option as well as a more subtle Stealth Blue option. The former is reserved just for the 450X, while the latter can be optioned even on the 450S.  The discreet belt drive cover looks neat, goes with the 450X's aesthetic. The 450X has always been a sleek, sharp-looking thing, and a small update that Ather has made in the recent past, which may have flown under the radar, is the new belt drive cover. It is ultra-sleek and not bulky like the Rizta’s. Ather 450X handling, issues we faced Beyond that, the 450X is the same as it’s always been. That means it’s still the same energetic, eager, and properly zippy thing that we’ve come to know and love over the past seven years.  Experiencing the 450X at the tight Aruani Grid go-kart track made me remember what a fun machine this is! It is by far one of the sharpest and most fun scooters in the market today, price notwithstanding.   Yes, it is still a little tight for taller folks, and its stiff ride quality is not very pleasant over bad roads – something available in abundance in our country.  The one additional gripe I have with the updated 450X is that locking up the rear wheel has become easier than before, with Magic Twist working hand-in-glove with the sharp rear disc. Riding it on Bombay’s slippery, gravel-ridden concrete roads is one additional concern I foresee.  Ather 450X price, verdict Ather’s software update for the 450X has given it some useful features and additional range, which is always welcome.  The price increase varies from variant to variant, ranging between Rs 2,000 and Rs 6,400. The biggest hike has actually gone to the 450X 2.9, but Ather will now supply the faster 700W charger with this variant, which alone is well worth the extra money. With its updated pricing, the 450X retains its premium position in the market, and if you’re browsing for a fun scooter, this is still one of the most entertaining ones available.  Also see:  2025 Ather 450X video review",

Tata Punch's rise to the top Reviewing the calendar year 2024 performance, Shailesh Chandra, MD, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd. and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Ltd. said the PV industry is expected to touch a sales volume of 4.3 million units, with strong growth in the SUV segment and sustained traction for emission-friendly powertrains.  Launched in 2021, Punch, with its SUV silhouette, upright stance, 190 mm ground clearance, and commanding driver position in a 3.8-metre footprint, created an all-new sub-segment in the sub-4 m SUV category.  Based on footprint, this segment is turning out to be an ideal alternative for prospective buyers of hatchbacks like the Maruti Swift. With these attributes, Tata Punch started selling over 10,000 units a month and became the 10th best-selling car in 2022. In terms of footprint, features, and price point, the Exter and Punch are equally matched; Hyundai and Tata have nearly similar sales footprints. However, the Hyundai Exter could not deliver even half the volume of the Tata Punch in 2024.  What does this mean for Maruti Suzuki? India's shift towards premium cars is turning out to be a litmus test for Maruti Suzuki, the country’s largest affordable car maker. Limited SUV options, especially at a price above Rs 10 lakh, impacted Maruti Suzuki’s market share.  Consider this: In 2018, before the pandemic, the Indian industry had its best year ever, with 33.49 lakh car sales. With 52 percent of the Indian market's share, Maruti sold more cars than all its competitors combined. And the top five best-selling products were all from Maruti’s stable.  In 2024, when the Indian industry reached another peak of about 42.86 lakh car sales in the post-pandemic era, Maruti’s market share not only fell to 41 percent but also lost the distinction of supplying India's best-selling car. History of India’s best-selling car In the post-independence era, Hindustan Motors’ Ambassador held the number one position for nearly three decades in a duopoly with the Premier Padmini as the second best-selling product in India back then. But in 1985, a modern, reliable, and affordable offering from Suzuki, the Maruti 800, took over the crown of best-selling car for years to come. The next four decades were dominated by Maruti-Suzuki, which grew from strength to strength, even when markets were opened to other foreign rivals in the post-90s liberalization era. After Maruti 800, its spiritual successor, Alto, remained a best seller for 13 years, reaching the highest sales of 3,11,367 in 2011. That’s the highest ever sales achieved by any car in the Indian industry in a calendar year. However, after 2018, things changed rapidly due to evolving regulations—e.g., the transition from BS IV to BS VI, and the call for mandatory airbags.  The number one position has been shifting among several Maruti products, from the sub-4m Dzire to the Swift premium hatchback to the tall-boy Wagon R. The 2024 top five list underlines how the shift in choice to SUVs has impacted not only vehicle brands but also the models and market share.  Also see:  SUVs, MPVs drive growth for Maruti in 2024 as hatchback sales decline Punch, Creta and Brezza highest selling SUVs in 2024",

    "description": "Indian team Hero MotoSports faced highs and lows as the 2025 Dakar Rally kicked off with Stage 1. Reigning World Rally Raid champion Ross Branch and his teammate Jose ‘Nacho’ Cornejo finished in the top 10. However, Hero’s third rider, Sebastian Buhler, was forced to retire after injuring his shoulder. Ross Branch finishes third in Stage 1 Raorane P97, Jain P131 Takale P37 in Dakar Classic Dakar 2025: Hero riders in Top 10 The first stage was all about adaptability, featuring a mix of surfaces and shifting tempos. Fresh off his podium finish in the Prologue, Branch continued his impressive form and set the third fastest stage time, 2mins 26secs behind winner Daniel Sanders (KTM). \"Stage 1 is done, the rally looks challenging at the start itself and hence, I'm bracing myself for a long and intense Dakar,” said Branch. “I had a blast today, despite making a couple of silly mistakes early on. Luckily, they didn't cost me too much. I'm just glad to have made it through in one piece, and I'm relieved to hear that my teammate Basti is okay after his crash.” Cornejo faced the tough task of opening the stage from the 20km mark. But he managed to finish in the top 10, setting the ninth fastest time. Unfortunately, Buhler’s Dakar 2025 journey has come to an end following a heavy crash that left him with an injured shoulder. The Portuguese rider now shifts his focus to recovery, leaving Branch and Cornejo as Hero’s two riders still in the running. Dakar 2025: Raorane, Jain, Takale make it through The rest of the Indian contingent also safely made it through Stage 1. With visibility being poor, Ashish Raorane opted to play it safe and finished the stage in 97th place. Jatin Jain, meanwhile, completed his first-ever Dakar Rally stage in 131st place. Over in the Dakar Classic class, Sanjay Takale scripted history, becoming the first Indian to compete in a Dakar four-wheeler category. Unlike the other classes, where the goal is to complete each stage with the fastest time, Dakar Classic follows a regularity rally (more commonly known as Time-Speed-Distance or TSD) format, where the goal is to complete each stage in a specified time and at a specified average speed. Takale stands 37th in the Dakar Classic standings after Stage 1. Watch this space for more updates from the 2025 Dakar Rally. Also see: Dakar 2025: Harith Noah out after prologue crash",
