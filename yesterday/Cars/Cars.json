    "link": "https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1932-indian-four/",
    "description": "This 1932 Indian Four was purchased new in 1933 at Al Crocker's Freed Indian of Los Angeles, California, by the seller's father who used it to transport stocks and bonds for the LA stock exchange. Crocker, a motorcycle racer and engineer, installed an oil cooler, modified the exhaust for more leg clearance, and relocated the carburetor at the time of purchase, and he later added a skirted rear fender. The seller's father parked the bike shortly thereafter due to the Great Depression, and then World War II, and it remained stored in his garage until the 1990s when he and his two sons began displaying it at car and motorcycle events. It was inherited by them upon their father's passing. Power is from a 77ci F-head inline-four paired with a hand-shifted three-speed transmission, and the bike is finished in red and black with gold graphics. Features include a leaf-spring fork, 18″ wire-spoke wheels, a hinged rear fender, and drum brakes as well as a double-sprung saddle, a headlight, a taillight, dual spotlights, an engine guard, and a headdress horn. Recommissioning work in 2024 included cleaning the fuel system, lubricating the rockers, greasing the chassis, and replacing the tires and carburetor float. This Model 403 is now offered at no reserve with a tool kit, an adjustable windshield frame, a leather skullcap, keys, and a clean California title in the seller's name.",

    "description": "Audi’s larger executive car turns electric, with a cutting-edge platform giving it more than 400 miles of range Rear-wheel drive, you say? An Audi estate with 375bhp and rear-wheel drive? Well, get your flying goggles on and pick your pig, because the unthinkable has happened. This is the new Audi A6 E-tron, which will arrive in the UK in the next few months.There's an Avant estate option but no traditional saloon; that role is filled by the saloon-ish yet conveniently hatched Sportback.This electric-only A6 is offered with a couple of different battery options nestled into the Volkswagen Group's new PPE platform, which also underpins the Audi Q6 E-tron and Porsche Macan Electric crossovers.The entry-level model makes do with an 83kWh nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) battery and 225kW charging from an 800V electrical system, not to mention ‘just’ 322bhp, all of which is good for a WLTP range of 383-361 miles, depending on whether you go for the Sportback or Avant.The Performance and Quattro variants get a 100kWh battery and either 375bhp or 456bhp respectively. The Quattro obviously gets dual-motor four-wheel drive, but it's a pricey option, so the rear-wheel-drive Performance that we’ve been driving is likely to be a more popular option in the UK.Both can charge at up to 270kW, for a 10-80% top-up in as little as 21 minutes provided the the erratic gods of rapid-charging are favouring you.The Performance gets an impressive official WLTP range of up to 463 miles in Sportback form or 437 miles as an Avant (the Quattro sacrifices roughly 20-30 miles of range for its additional poke).That’s a hugely persuasive aspect of the A6, given that the BMW i5 is similarly priced and manages more like 350 miles to a charge (although the Volkswagen ID 7 is cheaper and manages 424 miles).At the top of the range is the Audi S6 E-tron. You can get this in both the Avant and Sportback body shapes.Standard, rear-biased four-wheel drive comes courtesy of a permanent magnet motor at the back with 375bhp and 428lb ft on call and an asynchronous motor at the front with up to 188bhp and 203lb ft.They deliver up to 543bhp and 620lb ft combined for a 0-62mph time of 3.9sec. Mind you, that’s only in Launch mode; leave that button alone and the S6 makes do with 496bhp and a 0-62mph time of 4.1sec. A certifiable laggard at that point, of course…Other S6 highlights include standard adaptive air suspension and 21in wheels, plus an interior that’s stuffed with screens and ambient-lit nappa leather and finished with a full-length panoramic glass roof offering various patterns of opacity.The S6 comes in fully loaded Edition 1 trim, so it does have all the gubbins you want – which may ease the pain of it being teeth-suckingly close to £100,000.",

    "description": "Here is the definitive top 10 list of the best sports cars currently on sale - only one can be the very best... The most obvious part of the new car market eyed up by petrolheads is the sports car segment.  It's home to some of the most memorable cars ever built, with car makers including Porsche, BMW, Mercedes and Alpine investing heavily to produce some seriously capable models on sale today.  And even as so many other segments undergo such rapid change, this one still deals in big power, lightweight engineering, high-revving combustion engines and outstanding handling dynamism. A genre that's almost as old as the car itself, sports cars were first developed to bring some of the speed and excitement of early motorsport machines to the regular driver on the road. Now, they've matured and can be driven every day.  For this list, we've included the best full-sized sports cars with deep-chested acceleration and uplifting handling, that are as at home on the road as the track. However, that's not to say there isn't room for variety, which is why front, rear and mid-engined contenders make the cut here. We think the best sports car on sale today is the Alpine A110, but which other models make the cut? Read on as we list the best sports cars still on sale in 2024.",

Furthermore, Union has struck up the perfect relationship with a discerning client who regularly hauls in storied race machines in need of thorough reconditioning. It was for this unnamed client that Union just finished working their magic on a pair of remarkable F1-racing Suzukis—a Dunstall-prepped 1979 GS1000 raced by Barry Sheene and a 1982 Works XR69 raced to several podium finishes by Mick Grant.

    "description": "Someone wise recently told me: “A watch tells more than time.” Essentially, this means your watch is an extension of yourself, and different watches fit different people's personas. That saying is actually quite fitting for this bike – the gorgeous Royal Enfield Goan Classic 350. It isn't too different from the Classic 350, but it's targeted at a rather different rider – someone who wants to be unique but doesn't want the compromises that come with this style of bike. RE Goan Classic 350: Design, changes to Classic Design is one of the foremost ways the Goan Classic differs from the standard Classic. Starting at the front, you've got these very retro-looking whitewall tyres, which are found only on a microscopic amount of bikes available on sale today. While the tyres have a retro look, a welcome surprise is that the Goan Classic runs cross-spoke laced wheels, which permit tubeless tyres. The tyres are CEAT’s new Zoom Classic rubber, developed specifically for the Goan Classic. While the front wheel is a 19-incher, like the bike it is based on, the rear wheel is a 16-incher in proper bobber fashion. Then, the Goan Classic trades the Classic's handlebar for tall ape-hanger bars that put your arms almost straight and in line with your shoulders. It also has more forward-set pegs from the Meteor 350, and together, these changes put you in a properly relaxed riding position. The Goan Classic is also the only RE 350 to get the metal switch cubes from the larger 650s. Even the exhaust muffler is new and has a bit of a raspy note to it. You also have a cantilevered rider's seat, which is just 750mm off the ground, making it the second-lowest seat on any Royal Enfield today, after the Super Meteor 650. But my favourite design element is this articulated rear fender that moves with the wheel. The logos and badging on this bike also align with the retro custom aesthetic and add that little bit of extra pizzazz to its design. The Goan Classic’s colour palette is very funky and out there, and those who like to make a statement with their bikes will like the paint options. There are four colours to choose from, but my favourite has to be the Trip Teal (nice naming, RE!). RE Goan Classic 350: Ride and handling, comfort So, how do all these changes affect the riding experience? The short answer is, not much. The Goan Classic feels very similar to the Classic 350, which is a very pleasant feeling, with the only difference being how you're seated. The tall ape hangers work rather well when you're riding, and there's no strain on your arms or shoulders. After a brief accustomization period, I found my rhythm, and I suspect it will be the same for most others. The only small caveat here is that while making a tight U-turn, you need to plan your movements correctly and be a little more mindful of the tall bars. And because of how you're seated on the bike, you'll also bear the brunt of bad roads a little more than the Classic. That said, the Goan Classic is nowhere as uncomfortable as its competitors from Classic Legends. Honestly, aside from the different riding positions, the rest of the riding experience is pretty much identical to the Classic 350. This means it's the same relaxed, comfortable, and smooth yet torquey bike we've come to know and loved over the years. RE Goan Classic: Verdict All in all, the Goan Classic 350 feels like a cut above the rest of the 350s in terms of fit and finish, quality, and uniqueness. This will also be reflected in its price, as it is the most expensive 350cc Royal Enfield. Prices start at Rs 2.35 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) and go up to Rs 2.38 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), making it Rs 5,000 - Rs 8,000 more expensive than the top Emerald Chrome Classic 350. With the Goan Classic, you're getting a very unique-looking thing with proven fundamentals, a custom bike straight from RE. So, if you're one of the few people who use their watch not just to tell the time but to make a statement, I think the Goan Classic will be right up your alley.

    "description": "Everything just has to be some form of SUV these days, right? And you know what – that’s just fine. If you want a sedan with lifted suspension, a curvy roof and a punchier engine, do it! It’s adding more sport to your life. If you want a lifted hatchback with boxy sides and a bit of cladding, go for it – it gives you greater utility. That’s S and U covered. However, if you’re an alumnus of the Old School – the type who believes that an SUV must have four-wheel drive, high ground clearance and tough underpinnings, that it must be able to climb mountains, ford streams and have ancestors that fought in actual wars – there are only a handful of SUVs on the planet that would fit the bill. And after years of trying, we finally have three of them together on the same loose clump of mud. They all pay homage to their legendary ancestors, some more directly than others. The Jeep Wrangler, Land Rover Defender and Mercedes G-Class are not rivals in the truest sense of the word. How could they be, with prices of Rs 72 lakh, Rs 1 crore, and Rs 2.5 crore, respectively? What they are, though, are the modern descendants of three of the most iconic 4x4s in history and are themselves pretty iconic in their own right. So, while we will compare how they perform on and off the road and what creature comforts each of them provides, we’re also going to see what makes each of them unique. Defender vs G Class vs Wrangler off-roading  What better place for these three to start proving themselves than in the rough? Though each is good enough to be a benchmark for mud plugging, as proven in our Off-Road Day group test a couple of months ago, each also goes about it very differently. To this end, the Wrangler is the most focused on the task at hand; particularly in Rubicon guise, it is the most outright capable off-roader in the bunch. A lot of that is down to its standard mud-terrain (M/T) tyres that sink their sipes into the loosest of surfaces to pull the Jeep out of places lesser SUVs would need a winch for. Then there are the disconnecting sway bars that turn it from a rhino to a rock crab, giving it articulation that no stock SUV on the planet can match. There is some electronic assistance, too, including the ability to choose your hill descent speed, but the Wrangler experience is a largely mechanical and analogue one. As you’ll see later, you pay the price for this on the road, but to buy purely as an off-roader, the Rubicon is the way to go. Rubicon’s tenacious grip and articulation are second to none. (R) Tactile and colourful off-road controls gamify the experience. At the very opposite extreme is the Defender, which almost feels too nice to take off-road. It’s the furthest removed from its utilitarian forebear, ditching the tough ladder-frame chassis and rigid suspension for a monocoque and air springs. Instead of levers and knobs, you engage the hardware with light taps of a button or via the touchscreen. The locking diffs, ride height and traction control are managed by computer and drive modes, and such a level of autonomy in off-roading can be daunting at first. Once you get used to it, it’s remarkably capable, though perhaps not to the unstoppable level the Wrangler is. The electronics can often take a moment to figure things out, but once the algorithm deploys, it takes the effort out of off-roading. It truly is plush through the mush, though for off-roading enthusiasts, it could be a bit anticlimactic. Defender has serious hardware but all controlled by software. Sometimes, it takes a moment to read the surface but soon gets you out of trouble. There’s nothing anticlimactic about the G-Wagen, which is an occasion on four wheels. There’s a weighty, mechanical invincibility to the way it off-roads that sets it apart from the others. Having the most powerful engine here – a 3.0-litre diesel with 700Nm – certainly helps, and you get the sense it can just muscle its way out of a tricky situation. You rarely have to lock any more than the centre differential – done via the now-iconic three switches on the dash – but if you lock all three, it will twist the very Earth beneath you. It can feel a bit top-heavy (and heavy in general) through some hairier obstacles, but chances are you will give up a lot sooner than it will. G-Wagen takes a ‘pummel everything into submission’ approach. And once all three diffs are locked, nothing can stop it. Defender vs G Class vs Wrangler on-road manners  Let’s face it, though. Any of these cars will be used more on the tarmac than off it, but even if you’re buying one of these to only go off-roading, you still have to get to the mud via the road. And while they’re all pretty incredible in the muck, out on the road, it’s a different story. It takes a certain amount of commitment to choose a Wrangler and even more so to choose the Rubicon, which, despite its best efforts at modernity in 2024, feels the most compromised on the road. At any given time, there are at least three different rattles in the cabin, the footwell is tiny with no dead pedal, and wind (and sometimes water) enters via gaps in the bodywork. And all that’s before you get to the M/T tyres and rigid-axle suspension, which together make for a less-than-pleasant on-road experience. Tyre roar is ever present, getting worse the faster you go, and the ride quality is lumpy at best and crashy at worst. That aside, you’ll have little to complain about when it comes to the powertrain, which, though a little boomy, feels strong enough for this car. Another big surprise is the steering, which feels light and affords the Jeep impressive manoeuvrability. While all three are incredible in the muck, they will be used more on the tarmac than off it.  It’s not a surprise that the Defender is the best-behaved on the road. Its platform, after all, is based on the previous Range Rover’s, and with cushy adaptive air suspension, it rides like a dream. It’s also worth pointing out that it gives you the most choice – three body lengths, six seating configurations and five engines. This 300hp, 2.0-litre petrol is the smallest, though it doesn’t feel inadequate; you can also have a diesel or even a 635hp V8, with a corresponding increase in price, of course. It’s the best handling, too, with progressive steering and decent body control, especially if you put it in its Dynamic mode. It’s no sports SUV, but its monocoque setup makes it far more agreeable going fast around corners than the other two. Once again, the G-Wagen falls neatly between the other two. Yet, it is a force to be reckoned with, stronger than either of them. Though it has a ladder-frame chassis, it’s not as fidgety as the Wrangler but also nowhere as smooth as the Defender (or any other Mercedes SUV, for that matter). It doesn’t so much ride over bumps and potholes as it forces them to bend to its will. The seating position feels the tallest and most upright, perfect for lording over lesser vehicles. Its straight-six diesel is surprisingly smooth and easily the strongest, and yes, there’s the 585hp V8 AMG should you want more poke still. There are drive modes to unlock a bit more responsiveness, though they make little difference to the ride. No, it’s not a handler, though it has to be said it feels very stable at high speeds, almost as much as the air-sprung Defender. Defender vs G Class vs Wrangler design, interior and features To a layperson, the G-Wagen may as well be the same one that debuted in the late 1970s; such is its devotion to its original look. The truth is, this is an all-new generation that debuted in 2018, which, though still quite traditional under the skin, has seen the benefit of some modern tech. This includes Mercedes’ dual-screen infotainment system, although not the newest MBUX software and not even a touchscreen – these will come with a facelift next year. Quality and craftsmanship, however, are where you feel your money’s been spent, with lashings of contrast-stitched leather, metallic trim and carbon-fibre inserts – though I suspect some of these are optional extras; go figure. The Adventure Edition does add a bit of visual drama with mud flaps, a roof rack and a ladder, but even without this, the G has a uniquely towering presence. No shortage of bling, and quality is excellent. Retains an old-school feel. But, rear-seat comfort is not up to big luxury SUV standards. The other two aren’t far behind, mind you, and the Defender, especially – with its different body styles and exterior specifications – likes to let everyone know you’ve arrived. Yes, it looks a little like the original, but modern renditions of the original’s signature motifs – round headlamps, small tail-lamps and the roof-mounted ‘safari windows’ – are nice retro callbacks. On the inside, quality might be a little shy of the Mercedes, especially some of the plasticky switchgear, but it’s still ‘luxury-car’ good. And like on the outside, it does a modern interpretation of the classic cabin and offers loads of practical storage. It’s big on tech, too, with the latest Pivi Pro touchscreen being particularly slick to use, but they’ve helpfully kept some physical buttons in to make things easier to operate in the rough. The most practical, comfy and well-thought-out interior – front seat or back. Tech feels the most modern, and features list is long. Despite debuting a slick new 12.3-inch touchscreen, the Jeep has plenty of physical controls, too. In fact, it has a fun, almost toy-like dashboard layout that makes the other two look staid in comparison. There are lashings of red trim, fun iconography and plenty of Easter eggs littered around the cabin, and it suits its ‘off-road plaything’ personality well. Quality is still rather good, actually, and there’s even ADAS and a nice sound system, despite the fact that the doors and roof can be removed entirely. As a result, yes, they don’t shut (or shut the world out) in the same way the sophisticated Defender or vault-like G-Class do, but it’s all part of this SUV’s recreational nature. Quality and features impressive in an interior that can be stripped apart and hosed down. Rear seat low, firm and basic, to say the least. They all have large boots that can easily swallow up a couple of drinks coolers and weekend bags, with the Defender 110 getting an optional pair of small third-row jump seats that fold away. Of course, you can opt for the 90 or 130 versions if you want a more compact SUV or more seating space, respectively. Speaking of, the Defender’s second-row seats are the best, with the most space and the best comfort. The Mercedes feels comfy enough but too upright, while the Jeep seat feels low to the ground with not enough padding or support. Defender vs G Class vs Wrangler verdict They’re not rivals, so we don’t have to pick a winner, right? Well, yes and no. While their prices aim them at different buyers, there could be some overlap – perhaps if you could afford them all. They are united by their all-conquering abilities off-road, and each has a presence and desirability that would make anyone proud to park them in their driveway. But, since each has carved out its own rut, let’s see which one’s best at what. The Jeep makes some compromises to comfort in its quest to be the ultimate off-roader, and though there is a more user-friendly ‘Unlimited’ version, if you’re getting a Wrangler, it’s really the tough-as-nails Rubicon that you want. Thanks to local assembly, it comes at a (relatively) reasonable price, and for that, you get the greatest stock 4x4 in the world! How about that? If you feel an SUV should be able to ford streams, climb rocks and fight wars, these are the SUVs for you. The Gentleman’s Express that is the Land Rover Defender is more concerned that your tea doesn’t spill as you’re cresting that rock face. It’s determined to make off-roading as comfy and effortless as possible, and to that end, it feels more like it was designed to save you from a sticky situation rather than go out in pursuit of one, as the Wrangler might. Moreover, it’s the best one for the road, which, let’s face it, is where any of these cars will spend most of their time. If we’re talking strictly in superlatives, the G-Wagen is the one to go for. It does off-road well, on-road well enough, and absolutely kills it in the desirability stakes. Without forgetting its tough roots, it has managed to feel sufficiently plush on the inside, too. No wonder it’s the subject of so many rap songs. But we’d be remiss not to call out that inflated price, which, only a few years ago, was a full Rs 1 crore less! Inflation is one thing, but this feels like a cynical ‘but hey, if there are willing customers, why not!’ On balance, then, it’s the Defender that gets our vote. It does everything extremely well and nothing too badly, and best of all, it gives you so many options to make it your own. And all this at a relatively reasonable price that’s bang at the heart of the big luxury SUV market, and you can see why it’s JLR’s bestselling product in India by far.

    "description": "Following last month’s unveil of the its new logo and brand identity – over which there was much brouhaha – Jaguar has now taken the wraps off a concept car that it says previews the final production version due late next year. Will there be as much of a melee this time, too, or will the brand’s naysayers be placated? We got a first look at it in the UK, and here’s what we think. Called the Type 00, 0 for zero emissions and 0 for a reset or restart, the concept car has a very bold and flamboyant character and is a vision of what the new Jaguar and its products would look like. For sure, it’s nothing like previous Jaguars that were all about elegance and subtlety. In an interview, Jaguar’s managing director Rawdon Glover told Autocar India that this exuberant design – how Jaguar defines it – is very intentional and meant to cater to an audience that enjoys bold and dramatic designs. It’s a big gamble, but Glover says the company also wanted to steer clear of the typical EV designs today, which all look like they’ve been done in a wind tunnel, making design sacrifices for range. Indeed, the car has a very upright nose, a long bonnet despite not needing one, massive wheels and flared-out wheel arches. Also bold is the colour choice for the two show cars, pastel shades of pink and blue, and while there was much furore over this as well, the hues are a nod to the Miami Art Deco colour schemes. What the Type 00 also shows us is how the earlier unveiled brand design elements playout. The Device Mark (Jaguar lettering over strike through pattern) is used as the traditional grille, while the Makers Mark (leaping cat over a strikethrough) features on the fenders. Meanwhile the Artist Mark (J and R monogram) appears in the hub caps. Jaguar Type 00 concept car exterior At the front, beside the Device Mark grille, are slim headlights, which top a massive blank vertical section of the bumper. The bumper’s lower edge carries an air splitter, air intakes and slim daytime running lamps. On the bonnet’s top surface, towards the trailing edge, is a strikethrough pattern that visually travels inside the cabin onto the dashboard’s top edge and looks very neat. On the side, the car’s GT proportions are very obvious, with a very elongated bonnet and a large wheelbase, and while the Type 00 concept is a 2-door, the production car will be a 4-door GT and retain the same stance, says Jaguar. Also evident in the profile are the massive wheels and the small contrasting brass ingots that carry the Makers Mark and pop out to reveal rearview cameras. The front left fender also houses a powered hatch that holds what Jaguar calls the prism case. Inside this are three totems, key fobs, if you will, that can be placed in the centre console, each of which sets up the car to a specific theme, which includes ambient lighting and screen graphics. This idea could manifest in the production car as separate keys that set up the car to specific drive modes, including a valet mode. At the rear, very evident because of their absence, are tail-lights. However, these are hidden inside the top and bottom lines of the massive strikethrough pattern that makes for a very unique rear treatment. The rear also features a glassless tailgate, with cameras feeding the rear view inside. The concept’s roof is a fixed glass roof with a strikethrough pattern, which, under the spotlights during the presentation, cast a similar light-and-shadow pattern onto the car’s interior. It looked very cool. Jaguar Type 00 concept car interior The Type 00 opens up via large butterfly doors to reveal a minimalistic cabin divided through the centre by a brass bar. Jaguar calls it the spine. It divides the entire cabin into two separate areas and creates two separate dashboards, complete with slide-out screens for the driver and the passenger. The seats are upholstered in a stitch-free wool blend fabric and appear to be floating as they are mounted to the centre console, which is like a plinth made of travertine stone and supports both the seats and the centre spine. In keeping with the minimalist theme, the screens are completely hidden, and you only realise their presence once the screen glides open. The interior design also hides the presence of storage compartments, which all glide open and use bright shades for interior lighting. The strikethrough pattern is put to good effect here in concealing these elements, including a sound bar, and also creates a unique and interesting art deco vibe inside. New Jaguar EV platform and launch details The production car will debut a new underpinning called Jaguar Electric Architecture (JEA). So far, not much has been revealed about it other than a targeted range of 770km on the WLTP cycle and the ability to charge for a 321km driving range in 15 minutes. While it has been confirmed that Tata Motors will use JLR’s Electrified Modular Architecture (EMA) for its higher-end Avinya range of cars, the JEA platform will “only be used for vehicles designed, engineered and built in the UK”, says Glover, adding that currently “there are no plans of doing that [Tata Motors using the platform]”. The production car is all set for a launch towards the end of 2025 and will roll out to markets in a phased manner. The first phase would cover countries such as the UK and the US, where the brand does very well. India would fall in phase two, which would be towards the end of 2026 or early 2027. Prices for the car have not been revealed, but Jaguar says the 4-door GT would be at the high end of the spectrum and will move Jaguar further upwards and away from the “mass premium” space. However, Glover says there will be cars that will follow and “will perform to a different role and target a wider audience”, thus alluding to other body styles and a top-down approach to building the new Jaguar. While much noise was created over the teaser campaign’s lack of cars and colour choices, the actual concept car finally gives everyone an idea of where the products are headed. The car has an arresting presence and looks very striking indeed, if not a traditional Jaguar. As Glover says, “Type 00 is a signal of intent that Jaguar is changing”. Whether the prospective buyers warm up to this change is finally what the fate of the new Jaguar rests upon. Also see: Jaguar J-Pace SUV images surface three years after it was cancelled",

    "description": "“It’s interesting that you said start-up” says Jaguar MD Rawdon Glover when asked if he sees difficulties in acceptance for the brands move from its ‘established brand’ image to lone that’s more akin of a ‘start-up’. Speaking to Autocar India at a special preview of Jaguar’s rebranding and the Type 00 concept Glover said “the brief to the team, when they began this journey 4 years ago was actually, to think like a start-up”. The team was tasked to think the un-thinkable and break with convention adds Glover. Un-thinkable is putting it squarely, where earlier the Jaguar brand was all about elegance and subtlety, the new repositioning sees the brand move to a vivid and exuberant- as the company puts it – positioning and appeal. It’s a bold and risky move and one that has already garnered tremendous backlash, especially so for its move to a simple letter mark logo devoid of the leaping cat, and the choice of bright colours and vividly dressed peopleseen in the teaser campaign. Glover says the company is aware that this move will “shock some people because it’s a big departure from where we’ve been”but he adds that Jaguar were always at their best when they followed their pioneering spirit and a complete reinvention is what is required today. He’s also quick to point out that there hasn’t been a total disregard for the brands provenance pointing to the ‘leaper’ logo what has been retained, albeit not as the main stay but an embellishment and accompaniment to the new brand identity.  Glover feels that more than just the repositioning, the brands move further up the price ladder,away from the volume premium segment, will require them to speak to and attract a new set of customers. “We want as many of our current clients to come along with us but we know we will have to conquest a large group of people.” Jaguar will remain EV only The other big risk for Jaguar is the move to an all-electric model lineup. With the global uptake of electric vehicles slower than expected, brands have already announced tweaks to their EV plans and are working in more combustion engine models.Jaguar however says it is confident that electric is where the future of the market will be, Glover says “long term this is the right strategy, platforms are long term investmentsand there’s a lifespan of about 7 to 8 years, so its really important to ground our thinking and plans in the future rather than to what’s happening in 2024” He also adds that the company has other brands like Land Rover and Defender which have a full range of powerplants from petrol, hybrids to diesels, so Jaguar “will be EV only” So bold and EV only is what the Jaguars of the future will be, all to be designed and built in the same vein and character as the Type 00, which the company says is a clear signpost of where the brand is headed, including its retail spaces. The new plan is a bold and risky move, sidelining one’s provenance and positioning for a new one that pretty much diametrically opposite has the potential to bring plenty of reward but peril too. It isn’t the first time a company has faltered on a rebranding, but also, isn’t the first time a company has made a success of a rebrand either. For Jaguar the latter is clearly what its after.

    "description": "To keep a car running, change its oil every 3000 miles,” says 76-year-old Richard. His advice is nothing new, especially for anybody who owns an old Volkswagen, and he has applied this saying to his 1983 Volkswagen Beetle, which has served him for over 20 years. Some 20 years ago, Richard got a call from a friend saying that there was a Beetle for sale not too far away from him. He decided to take a look, and the moment he saw the Bug, he instantly fell in love with it. Continue...",

    "description": "Photography by: Johnathan Rothman (@thejohnrothman) 1956 Jaguar XK140 Convertible Raced in period by Briggs Cunningham and Denise McLuggage Location: California, USA Country of original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: S818207 Mileage: 76,025 miles Colour: Red Original colour of delivery: Carmine Red Price: Call for Price The car As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer a unique collector-grade Jaguar. The Jaguar XK140 represented the epitome of front-mounted 6-cylinder Jaguars in the mid-1950s. This particular example is without a doubt the most storied one in the United States of America, as it was raced and campaigned by two of the most prolific personalities in the American racing world. The car was first campaigned by renowned Briss Cunningham, who was indisputably one of the most pivotal figures in postwar sports car racing, making a profound impact as a driver, team owner, and constructor. Briggs then proceeded to donate his XK140 to Denise McLuggage, an American auto racing driver, journalist, author and photographer. She pioneered gender equality in motorsports and journalism in the U.S., and was among the very first women taking part in professional automotive racing. Her racing achievements included winning the grand touring category at Sebring in a Ferrari 250 GT in 1961, and a class win in the Monte Carlo Rally in a Ford Falcon in 1964. She also participated in the Nürburgring 1000 km sports car race. This car's past is in fact so fascinating that it recently enabled it to earn a very coveted spot in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (MSHFA), where it resided in 2022 alongside other giants of the racing world. What's perhaps even more remarkable, is that the car presents in unaltered condition. It's been kept 'as-is' by its 4 owners (Briggs Cunningham, Denise McLuggage, and 2 other owners, including the present one), and is showing a splendid amount of patina. Everything about this car is original and has remained untouched over the last 58 years - the chassis, body panels, engine, transmission, suspension, wheels, seats, dashboard materials, and more, are all original. And, magically, 58 years later, it still elegantly runs and drives. Continue...",
