    "description": "This 1962 Porsche 356B coupe was was converted to a race car in the mid-2000s by Emory Motorsports, who later modified it in Outlaw style in 2012. It was acquired by the current owner in 2018, and has since been refurbished, including a repaint in blue and a reupholstered interior. The car is powered by a 1,720cc flat-four paired with a four-speed manual transaxle, and equipment includes four-wheel disc brakes, 15\" aluminum wheels, Spax shocks, a front sway bar, polycarbonate side windows, a front hood fuel filler, and an aftermarket center-exit exhaust system. Inside, the cabin houses a roll bar, GT Speedster-style seats trimmed in blue leatherette and tan corduroy, and a four-spoke steering wheel. This 356B coupe is now offered in Costa Mesa, California on dealer consignment with Emory build records and a Montana title.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/government-funding-squeeze-puts-roads-back-burner",
    "description": "A303 Stonehenge bypass was announced in 2014, was cancelled in 2024 Road upgrades slow to a snail's pace as government budgets are squeezed Twelve years after it was given the go-ahead and five years since construction started, the new 0.9-mile Silvertown Tunnel beneath the Thames that links Silvertown in east London to the Greenwich Peninsula will open on 7 April. The announcement by Transport for London (TfL) is a rare piece of good news at a time when, elsewhere in the country, many proposed road schemes are being axed in the face of cutbacks or opposition. Shortly after taking office in July last year, the Labour government scrapped the A27 upgrade and the controversial A303 Stonehenge tunnel scheme that had cost taxpayers £166 million in development. Then, in the Autumn Budget in October, it axed a further five National Highways projects – a decision taken because, according to then transport secretary Louise Haigh, they were “unaffordable”. The previous government had said the A1 Morpeth to Ellingham scheme – one of the five axed – would be funded from money saved by scrapping the northern leg of HS2. However, with the new government facing what it claimed was a £22 billion “black hole” in the public finances, it had other plans. Against this backdrop, the completion of the Silvertown Tunnel seems like a miracle – except that the crossing’s £2.2bn cost has been funded by the private sector. TfL says this will be repaid over the next 25 years by tolls of up to £4. While this toll-based model has secured the future of the tunnel, major road projects funded instead by taxpayers remain vulnerable to cancellation when government finances are squeezed. Economists, such as Bradshaw Advisory’s Matthew Brighty, warn that putting UK roads to the back of the funding queue risks harming the government’s plans to grow the economy. Brighty said: “If Labour wants to grow the economy and attract investment, it is essential to commit to long-term road infrastructure projects. “Investing in improving our outdated roads and tackling rising congestion before it gets worse will boost business, productivity, connectivity and unlock economic potential. The strategic road network needs real investment.” However, the level of investment Brighty believes is required has, in recent years, not materialised or has been spent ineffectively. Every five years, the government’s road investment strategy (RIS) sets out where cash will be spent. The most recent, RIS2, which covers the period to March 2025, pledged to spend £27.4bn on the strategic road network, including committing £14.1bn to 69 road enhancement projects. However, around £3.5bn of the budget was clawed back and the number of projects reduced. The National Audit Office subsequently reported that the spending programme would deliver fewer projects and at far higher cost than expected. As a result of delays caused by the parliamentary inquiry that followed and the change of government, implementation of the strategy’s successor, RIS3, which covers the period April 2025 to March 2030, has been delayed until the government’s spending review in June. Explaining this delay, future of roads minister Lilian Greenwood said the strategic road network is “an economic engine [that] needs our attention and demands a long-term plan”.  She added: “In order to shape that future, we need to take time to ensure we have the right programme, taking the opportunity provided by the Treasury Spending Review in spring to allow us to build a road investment strategy that will be better placed to invest and deliver for the long term.” Until then, and to ensure at least some projects remain on track, an ‘interim roads settlement’ for 2025-26 has been established. This includes up to £5m for work on the A75, as well as unspecified amounts for projects on the A47. Meanwhile, National Highways has set aside £347m to fund a “pipeline of future projects” that includes more than 30 major road schemes that were originally intended for consideration in RIS3 but have now been pushed back, possibly to RIS4 (April 2030 to March 2035). They include improvements to the M1, M6, A1 and A5 in the north of England, the M11, A11 and A12 to the east, and the A303, A3, A27 and A38 to the south-west. Despite cash being set aside, all of these projects are still up in the air. A spokesperson said: “These schemes remain uncommitted, with no guarantee they’ll be taken forward for further development work.” Today, however, the government has announced a more substantial £90m investment in four road upgrade projects: the A350 Chippenham Bypass in Wiltshire, Dawsons Corner and Stanningley Bypass on the A647 in Leeds, the South East Aylesbury Link Road in Buckinghamshire and the A127/A130 Fairglen Interchange in Essex. \"The UK’s roads are the backbone of a growing economy, which is why we’re giving these vital schemes the go ahead, helping deliver our Plan for Change,\" said Greenwood.",

    "description": "Chinese giant tries its hand at an ultra-lucrative, ultra-competitive market segment It is difficult to underestimate the importance of the BYD Atto 2 to its maker.Slotting into the range between the Dolphin and Atto 3, it’s a midsize crossover/SUV looking for a slice of market share from an ultra-competitive segment.Rivals are flooding in from all corners of the globe, including the Vauxhall Frontera Electric, Volvo EX30, Hyundai Kona Electric, MG 4, Jeep Avenger, Mini Aceman and Peugeot E-2008. The list goes on.Built primarily for urban families looking for a dose of practicality, the Atto 2 promises \"class-leading\" interior technology and practicality, as well as generous levels of standard equipment and a competitive price tag. Let’s find out if it can hold its own.The BYD Atto 2 range at a glanceComplications from China mean the Atto 2 strays from the brand’s revised nomenclature in not being named Sealion, as its SUVs were due to be called.From launch, you can only have a 45.1kWh battery (of usable capacity) that provides a range of 194 miles, however UK-specification cars are due to get a slightly larger 50kWh unit with a bit more range, but that figure isn’t confirmed yet. The battery is mated to a 174bhp electric motor driving the front wheels. Two specifications will initially be available: Active and Boost. We won’t see Active models in the UK, meaning Boost cars will become our entry-level model. A longer-range Comfort version, with a larger battery and more powerful electric motor, will join the ranks at the end of the year.All cars get an 8.8in digital instrumentation display, which is accompanied by an infotainment touchscreen of varying sizes depending on which specification you choose. Active cars get a 10.1in display, while Boost and Comfort get a 12.8in unit which can be rotated from portrait to landscape depending on your preference. Elsewhere inside, every model receives over-the-air updates and is equipped with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, voice commands, seats upholstered in vegan leather, heated seats, a crystal-effect gear selector and a panoramic glass roof.",

They celebrated their tenth anniversary last year, and wanted to celebrate in style with a special custom build. The stars aligned when a customer approached them to create a slick Honda CB500F café racer for short rides and events. “The client wanted a Honda Four that maintained some original aspects, such as the mechanical aspects and the tank,” says shop boss Bruno Costa. “But they also wanted a more modern, aggressive design.” The Honda Four they chose was a 1974 Honda CB500F—a veritable pillar of the café racer world. The non-running bike arrived at the Caffeine Custom workshop in such a sorry state that the shop had their work cut out for them.…",

Thankfully, Yuichi Yoshizawa doesn’t share our reservations. The frontman of the hit-making Japanese workshop, CW Zon, is known for applying his signature style to the most unlikely of motorcycles.

    "description": "Last year, Ultraviolette introduced the updated F77 Mach 2, bringing subtle design tweaks, new features, and drivetrain improvements. However, many riders wanted a more comfortable  setup, especially since most F77 owners primarily rode within city limits. Enter the F77 Super Street—a refined version of the Mach 2 with adjusted ergonomics and minor design changes. So, is the Super Street the better choice among the F77 models? Absolutely. Ultraviolette F77 Super Street design updates The Ultraviolette F77 Mach 2 has always been a striking machine, and the Super Street stays true to that design. Visually and feature-wise, it remains largely unchanged from the Mach 2, with no exclusive new additions. However, it does come in four new colors, though distinguishing between the two models requires a sharp eye. The most noticeable differences are the taller, wider handlebar and a redesigned headlight cowl. The rider footpegs remain the same as before and the company says this is done to maintain some sense of aggression with the ergonomics. Feature-wise, everything carries over, including 9 levels of regen, 3 levels of traction control, and dynamic stability control as standard on both variants. Ultraviolette also claims that the new headlight cowl improves aerodynamics by 15-20 percent compared to the Mach 2. It continues to get the same 5-inch TFT that is now slightly more inclined offering better legibility. Ultraviolette F77 Super Street ride and handling Despite weighing in at 207kg, the F77 Super Street’s ergonomic tweaks have made it a more manageable machine. Compared to the Mach 2, it feels noticeably easier to maneuver at low speeds, making urban riding less demanding. That said, its weight is still apparent when lifting it off the stand or pushing it around at parking speeds. While the more relaxed riding position offers some clear improvement in comfort, it doesn’t drastically alter the overall experience. The suspension setup remains unchanged and is carried over from the Mach 2. However, the new handlebar design reduces weight over the front fork, allowing for slightly more usable suspension travel.  Our test ride was limited to a go-kart track and well-paved backroads, but on the occasional rough patch, the Super Street felt a bit more forgiving. Although, this might just be because there’s less load on your wrists and back. Handling remains sharp, and through a series of corners, the bike is just as engaging as before. Ultraviolette F77 Super Street performance and braking Like the Ultraviolette F77 Mach 2, the new F77 Super Street is available in two variants. The base model features a 7.1kWh battery, delivering 36.2hp and 90Nm of torque, with an IDC range of 211km. The top-spec F77 Super Street Recon, which we rode, comes with a larger 10.3kWh battery, delivering 40hp and 100Nm of torque, while offering an impressive 323km IDC range. Riding the Super Street is a unique experience, with ample torque always available on demand. On a tight and technical track like the one we tested on, the throttle felt precise and easy to modulate. With the highest level of regenerative braking engaged, I found myself rarely using the brakes, allowing for a smooth and fast-paced flow through corners. Braking performance is commendable, though the only drawback I noticed was the bike’s weight under heavy braking. Ultraviolette F77 Super Street verdict The F77 Mach 2 is an exciting machine but demands more from the rider due to its aggressive ergonomics. In contrast, the F77 Super Street retains all the best aspects of the Mach 2 while offering a more accessible ride with its relaxed ergonomics.  A clear representation of the difference in ergonomics between the F77 Mach 2 and Super Street. Considering it comes at essentially the same price as its sibling, it’s an easy recommendation for anyone looking to step up to an electric motorcycle that’s both fun and engaging but also reasonably comfy for city riding.

    "description": "The Volkswagen entry-level EV has been teased officially for the first time ahead of its debut. This new model from the German brand will be an all-electric successor to the now discontinued Up hatchback.  Entry-level VW EV could be called ID.One upon debut It will get a raised and rugged, crossover-like design It will get a front-mounted motor, a smaller battery pack than the ID.2 Entry-level Volkswagen EV will use a shortened MEB platform This new Volkswagen EV will be positioned below the Volkswagen ID.2all hatchback. Likely to be called ID.One or ID.1, this new EV is expected to be a five-door model with a slightly raised stance and body cladding to give it some musculature. It will be one of nine new models to debut by 2027, expanding the brand's global all-electric lineup. The teaser shows rectangular headlamps with 3D LED graphics neatly integrated in the black grille along with an illuminated VW logo. The entry-level EV also sports slim vertical DRLs on the front bumper and mildly sculpted fenders.  This new entry-level VW EV will be built on the MEB platform, shared with ID.2all hatchback, though it'll be a shortened version. The smaller EV is likely to get a single motor setup and a compact battery pack to keep costs in check. The same underpinnings and powertrain are also expected to be used the entry-level Skoda and Seat EVs aimed at the European market. Volkswagen CEO Thomas Schäfer celebrated the new car as a pivotal moment for the company, saying, \"An affordable, high-quality, and profitable electric Volkswagen from Europe for Europe: that's the Champions League of automotive engineering!” The production facility that will build the entry-level Volkswagen EV has not been finalised yet. The ID.2all and the ID.2X crossover will be built by the Volkswagen Group in Spain, alongside the Skoda Epiq and the Cupra Raval SUVs. Volkswagen technical development boss Kai Grünitz had previously suggested the new entry model will be an obvious successor to the successful Up hatchback in its conception, and will share some design elements and attributes. Volkswagen EVs for India While there is no word on this entry-level VW EV making its way to India, the German brand is working on bringing EVs to the market based on a localised version of the CMP architecture. Development of the IMP, or ‘India Main Platform’ for EVs – which is a derivative of the CMP (China Main Platform) with strong localised elements – has already begun and a compact electric SUV and a midsize SUV are planned.

    "link": "",
    "description": "History Repeating: A New Golden Age for Le Mans Shines Brighter Than Ever The 24 Hours of Le Mans is the world’s most famous sports car race, and since its inaugural edition in 1923, the legendary event has seen fluctuating levels of manufacturer competition. Today, however, we are witnessing an unprecedented resurgence, as three iconic marques—each with a rich legacy of success—are set to join the already stacked grid of Alpine, BMW, Cadillac, Ferrari, Peugeot, Porsche, and Toyota in the battle for overall victory. Aston Martin will debut its radical Valkyrie hypercar this year, while Genesis—the luxury division of Hyundai—will enter the fray in 2026, embarking on a new motorsport chapter. Meanwhile, Ford recently announced a factory-backed return in 2027, and insiders suggest that McLaren is preparing to follow suit. A joint McLaren-Ford entry, reminiscent of their final Formula 1 season together in 1993 with Ayrton Senna, was initially explored but ultimately abandoned. However, McLaren’s announcement of a long-awaited return could be perfectly timed for the 30th anniversary of its stunning 1995 Le Mans victory. Watch this space! Aston Martin: A Lone Overall Victory, But a Storied Le Mans History Aston Martin returns to Le Mans with unfinished business. The British marque’s only overall win came in 1959, when Carroll Shelby and Roy Salvadori piloted a DBR1/300 to victory in a grueling race of attrition. Shelby, battling dysentery and carrying a nitroglycerin capsule under his tongue for heart issues, and Salvadori, who drove for 14 hours despite suffering from the flu, emerged victorious ahead of the sister Aston Martin of Maurice Trintignant and Paul Frère. Ferrari finished third, while Porsche endured its worst-ever showing, with all its cars failing to finish. Aston Martin first entered Le Mans in 1928, running nearly every edition until it shifted focus to a less-than-successful Formula 1 campaign. However, it found further glory in GT racing, winning the GT1 class in 2007 and 2008 with the DBR9, famously defeating Corvette in fierce head-to-head battles. The brand's most thrilling modern Le Mans moment came in 2017, when its Vantage GTE snatched victory from a faltering Corvette C7.R in the race’s dying minutes. Now, in 2025, Aston Martin steps back into the top class with the V12-powered Valkyrie—a road-going hypercar developed in collaboration with Formula 1 aerodynamicist genius Adrian Newey. Among its fiercest rivals? Ferrari, winners of the past two Le Mans editions with the 499P hypercar, and Porsche, the reigning World Endurance champions with a factory-backed effort led by motorsport legend Roger Penske. Ford: Iconic GT40 Dominance and a Triumphant Return Ford’s Le Mans legacy was immortalized in the 2019 film Ford v Ferrari, which dramatized Henry Ford II’s personal vendetta against Enzo Ferrari after a failed acquisition deal. Determined to exact revenge, Ford assembled an all-star team led by Carroll Shelby (yes, the ’59 winner with Aston, who was now focused on running the cars) and star driver Ken Miles, and together they steered the GT40 into a race-winning machine. In 1966, Ford famously secured a 1-2-3 sweep, though a controversial staged finish saw Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon take the victory over the Miles/Denny Hulme entry. Tragically, Miles was killed testing the car’s successor (The ‘J-Car’ which became the GT40 MkIV) but his legacy was assured. The GT40’s dominance continued, with Dan Gurney and A.J. Foyt winning in 1967—an event best remembered for Gurney’s spontaneous invention of the champagne-spraying podium celebration. The Gulf-liveried GT40 of Pedro Rodríguez and Lucien Bianchi triumphed in 1968, followed by Jacky Ickx’s legendary 1969 victory, where he deliberately walked to his car at the start in protest of the traditional sprint start, only to deliver a masterclass in racecraft by winning the race by a mere 120 meters. Ford returned to Le Mans in 2016, celebrating the 50th anniversary of its historic first victory by winning the GTE-Pro class with the modern GT, in a program managed by Chip Ganassi Racing. McLaren: The Shock 1995 Victory That Defined Its Hypercar Legacy This June is McLaren’s 30th anniversary of its jaw-dropping victory in 1995, when its F1 GTR won on debut in dramatic fashion. In tasting a sweet victory the Woking-based brand, which was better-known for its Formula 1 success, scored four of the top five positions, with only the second-placed Courage C34 prototype, that included racing legends Mario Andretti and Bob Wollek, putting up a fight. The destiny of the race win was transformed in the closing stages, as the race-leading Harrods McLaren, run by David Price, suffered gear selection problems. This writer just happened to be in pits with two hours to go when Wallace alighted and handed over to Derek Bell, and I only realized something was amiss when he insisted on briefing Bell at length before Derek climbed in, delaying the car’s departure. When it was eventually released, instinct told me to tail Andy into the garage (a journalist’s life was far easier in those days!) where he exclaimed to Price “It’s f*cked, Dave! The gearbox is completely f*cked! I’ve told Derek to leave it in sixth”. This led to a lot more swearing from Price, with whom I developed a warm friendship in years to come but, on that day, I was one of many in the vicinity who was told in no uncertain terms where to go, as he vented the frustration of losing a Le Mans victory in such cruel circumstances. That handed victory to the Lanzante-run Kokusai Kaihatsu Racing team’s lineup of JJ Lehto (who starred in wet conditions in the night), Yannick Dalmas \u0026 Masanori Sekiya. That team had solved the McLaren’s delicate gear linkage issue, which affected many of its entries, by repeatedly spraying it with WD40 at each pitstop. That helped it to win by a lap. While that remains McLaren’s sole success at Le Mans, its modern-day road cars, like the P1 and recently-launched W1, take huge inspiration from the endurance racing heritage established by the F1 GTR. The Future of Le Mans’ Golden Era Success at Le Mans cements a manufacturer’s place in motorsport history and leaves a lasting imprint on its brand identity. The race’s influence extends beyond the track, shaping the development of the world’s most celebrated hypercars. No wonder that so many marques are signing up for this current golden age of sports car racing. Continue...",

    "link": "",
    "description": "https://youtu.be/2TdYfbosJhc In Stuttgart, two brands are king: Porsche and Mercedes. Their presence is ubiquitous, paved into the roads, the culture, and the very identity of the region. If you grew up there, you were supposed to pick a side and pledge allegiance to one of the two. Jürgen Claus grew up in Stuttgart but didn’t adhere to that conventional German wisdom. Something else had earned his attention. In flashes, glimpses, and a few stolen frames of life during rides on his bike, he would spot a car. It would streak past, barely there, and then gone, but each time, it gave Jürgen something to dream about. Before it was a legend, before it was the car that toppled giants, the A110 was a newly fleshed curiosity. The Alpine was born in Dieppe, France, in the early 1960s as Jean Rédélé’s vision of a “weight is king” sports car built for agility over brute force. He saw weight as the real enemy, believing that the right balance of power, size, handling, and simplicity would create something truly special. What the world ended up with was a fiberglass-bodied, rear-engined scalpel of a car, built on Renault underpinnings. It was compact, delicate looking, and deceptively quick. The A110 would eventually thrive where muscle cars faltered, becoming a Rally tool that affixed its name onto motorsport history. It won everywhere, on the Monte Carlo stages, in the Alps, on gravel, on tarmac. It was light, agile, and utterly unforgiving. In 1973, when the World Rally Championship was officially founded, it was the Alpine A110 that took the very first title, proving that more horsepower wasn’t always better. Other lightweight pioneers like the Lancia Stratos may never have been penned if it wasn’t for the A110. Jürgen’s search for his A110 took him deep into the unknown, pulling threads on rumors and whispers. Finding a regular Alpine in decent condition isn’t easy. Finding a works race car? Almost impossible. The world is full of lookalikes, tributes, and fiberglass imposters. True competition built A110s are ghosts. He eventually caught wind of a car that had supposedly been sold in Hungary, a real Alpine with real pedigree. There were no documents, no clear paper trail, just a lead. He did what anyone with an obsession this deep would do. He packed a backpack full of cash and hit the road. No guarantees, no promises.  Beneath layers of questionable modifications, spoilers, turbochargers, intercoolers, there was something unmistakable. The plaques in the front trunk were still original. On them, the chassis number revealed the truth. The car was real. It didn’t matter that it looked nothing like it should. It didn’t matter that it would take years of work to bring it back. He wasn’t leaving without it. Jürgen spent years undoing the damage. Hours turned into weeks and weeks turned into months. Sanding, welding, reshaping... dreaming. Obsessing. There were no blueprints, no factory records with detailed specs. The A110 wasn’t built with the obsessive precision of a Stuttgart engineer. It was built by French hands, refined through trial and error. Every reinforcement, every brace, every tweak was added as needed. Problems were solved on the spot, one by one with little documentation to follow. There were only 17 genuine versions of this car ever built, and that is in 1973. How many still existed? Just a handful of originals bobbing in  a sea of replicas. Waiting to be discovered, and restored. “My name is Jürgen Claus,” he says, “and I fell in love with a queen. The queen of rallies.”   Continue...",
