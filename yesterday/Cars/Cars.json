    "description": "Two of the most compelling options in the mid-capacity category in India are the 2025 KTM 390 Adventure and the Royal Enfield Himalayan 450. While both bikes promise adventure-ready capabilities, they take different approaches to design, features, performance and ride quality. However, the most significant difference between the two is their price, and we’re here to tell you if the new kid on the block justifies its higher price tag. Form and function The latest KTM 390 Adventure embraces a more rugged ADV-focused design. While it appears more premium than its predecessor, its underbelly exhaust design deviates from traditional adventure bikes. The KTM’s headlamp easily outshines the RE’s. Available in only two colours, the KTM’s aesthetic may not appeal to everyone, but it does feel modern and carries less visual bulk than the Himalayan. However, the extensive use of plastic panels means you will need to learn to live with buzzes and rattles, something our test bike already had. The RE’s headlamp has adequate illumination. The Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 has less of a traditional ADV aesthetic and instead focuses on a more muscular naked look with a big fuel tank, minimal bodywork and a small windscreen. The larger dimensions, heavier weight and distinct side-stand lean angle make it feel like a bigger motorcycle, but the downside is that this makes it heavy and intimidating for some riders. The Himalayan’s more metal-heavy construction gives it a greater sense of durability and toughness. The 390 Adventure's TFT has a better user interface. Both motorcycles have essential electronics such as a TFT display, switchable ABS and riding modes, but the KTM 390 Adventure goes one step ahead with segment-first features like cruise control, traction control, cornering ABS and dedicated ABS modes. KTM's switchgear feels higher quality and more tactile. The KTM’s user interface is smoother, retains rider preferences even after being switched off, and has a more premium feel with tactile switchgear. Himalayan's circular TFT is legible even on a sunny day. In contrast, the Himalayan 450’s electronics feel less refined. The mode-switching response is inconsistent, and the built-in Google Maps navigation, while excellent in theory, requires an unlocked smartphone screen to function, making it less practical. The Enfield's switchgear doesn't feel nearly as tactile as the KTMs. The toggle switch to browse the menu also feels flimsy and tricky to control, diminishing the user experience. Given these quirks, the KTM’s interface feels more polished and rider-friendly.  Comfort and convenience The KTM 390 Adventure has an upright seating position with wide handlebars, making it comfortable for taller riders. Its slightly forward-leaning stance aids control, while the taller windscreen provides better wind protection. However, the non-adjustable windscreen can be intrusive for some and blocks airflow, making city riding in hot weather uncomfortable. Its LED headlamp is among the best on any Indian motorcycle, significantly outperforming the Himalayan’s. KTM doesn’t offer an alternative to their hard seat. KTM has equipped the 390 Adventure with crash bars, a bash plate and handguards, but the bike lacks a centre stand and has limited luggage-mounting points. While KTM offers optional accessories, the Himalayan takes the lead in customisation. Useful rear rack and optional touring seats make the Himalayan better equipped for a long tour. Royal Enfield offers a wide range of OEM accessories, including luggage options, seat choices and crash protection. It has better standard luggage mounting points, and its tank guard doubles up as an extra mounting location. The optional touring seat is among the most comfortable in its class, making it better suited for long rides. Off the beaten path The KTM 390 Adventure is a significant 13kg lighter than the Himalayan, making it easier to manoeuvre. The lighter weight also helps shorter riders feel more confident in handling the bike, particularly off-road. The KTM’s throttle response is precise, its electronics enhance trail riding, and its brakes offer better control. Thanks to its lighter weight, the KTM is easier to handle off-road. The bi-directional quickshifter is a great addition, making gear shifts seamless – especially when wearing off-road boots. However, the KTM’s suspension struggles with aggressive off-road riding, frequently bottoming out. While KTM offers adjustable suspension, it doesn’t cope as well as the Himalayan, even when firmed up, and most riders would prefer a well-balanced setup out of the box. The Himalayan 450, on the other hand, offers a superior suspension setup that absorbs off-road bumps effortlessly. Despite its heavier weight, it manages low-speed manoeuvres and jumps surprisingly well. The torquey engine is easy to control, and the clutch, though precise, is not as light as the KTM’s. The brakes require careful modulation, as the rear locks up easily. While lacking advanced electronic rider aids, the Himalayan still performs admirably in off-road conditions, handling about 95 percent of what the KTM does and keeping its rider more comfortable while at it. On the open road On highways, the KTM 390 Adventure is more engaging and stable and equipped with cruise control, which is a game-changer for long-distance touring. The KTM shares its main frame and engine with the 2024 KTM 390 Duke, but it features a bespoke rear subframe, swingarm and steering head for enhanced stability. It holds triple-digit speeds effortlessly and accelerates faster than the Himalayan. In our tests, the 390 Adventure was nearly a second quicker to 100kph, while roll-on acceleration is almost on par. The Himalayan 450 offers a more tractable mid-range and better overall comfort. Its plush suspension smooths out rough patches, making it the better option for long-distance touring. It also has a larger fuel tank, improving range. However, the Himalayan’s handlebar vibrates at higher RPMs, leading to numb hands after extended riding. Despite this, the Himalayan performs well as a commuter, with a tighter turning radius and smooth lane-splitting capabilities. Meanwhile, the KTM feels  smooth at highway speeds but has harsh vibrations in the footpegs at lower revs within the city. What took me by surprise were the Himalayan’s braking figures, which were pretty much on par with the KTM’s despite a significantly higher weight. Different strokes for different folks  Both motorcycles present compelling options depending on rider priorities. The KTM 390 Adventure offers lighter weight, superior electronics and stronger performance. The main attraction is that it is lighter and easier to ride than the Himalayan, and it has a chassis that is engaging both on and off the road. On the other hand, the Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 is a more rugged, comfortable and budget-friendly alternative. The KTM is clearly the better adventure bike, but the issue arises when you look at the on-road price difference, which stretches to as much as Rs 80,000-90,000 in Mumbai. If you simply want the KTM’s lighter and friendlier nature, then the lower-spec 390 Adventure X with its 19-inch front wheel is the answer, especially since it costs the same as the Himalayan. However, those willing to pay additional money for the standard 390 Adventure will probably be doing so for the extra edge in off-road performance, and that’s where the KTM’s suspension doesn’t quite match the expectation. That’s why, in this particular comparison, the Himalayan 450 just about wins by a whisker from a value-for-money perspective.

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/car-long-termer/tata-curvv-ev-long-term-review-5320km-report-435063#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Car+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "It was only fitting that the first intercity run in our long-term Curvv EV was to the Tata Motors plant in Pimpri for a special occasion – Tata Motors’ EV Day, celebrating the milestone of 2,00,000 Tata EVs sold! No other Indian manufacturer has achieved this feat, a testament to Tata’s pioneering role in the country’s electric mobility revolution. Launched in August last year, the Curvv EV is the latest addition to Tata’s electric line-up. Essentially a ‘coupe-fied’ version of the Nexon, it packs a larger battery, more power and faster charging. While we’ve yet to test its DC fast charging speeds, our first top-up was on our office’s 22kW AC charger. The Curvv EV supports AC charging at 7.2kW, which is sufficiently fast when the car is parked at work. The charging port is conveniently located in the nose, so it’s easy to access from any side. However, accessing the charging port wasn’t as simple as expected, and it had a glitch. The flush-fitting charging flap, designed to slide open via a haptic touch control on the dashboard, refused to budge. No amount of pressing or coaxing worked, and in the end, I had to physically pry it open by hand – hardly ideal when you’re plugging in regularly. This fault was reported to Tata Motors, and after a quick workshop visit, it was rectified. That said, the location of the charging port – neatly integrated into the Curvv’s nose – is a definite advantage. In our office parking, where the designated EV slot is right next to a wall, side-mounted charging ports can be a hassle, often requiring an awkward squeeze to plug in. More often than not, you end up brushing against the wall and dirtying your clothes. With the port up front, there’s none of that frustration – just a clean, open space to manoeuvre the charging gun into the socket with ease. Gliding up to Tata Motors’ plant on the outskirts of Pune took under three hours, thanks to the Atal Setu, which has changed our lives. Getting in and out of Mumbai is unbelievably easy and even pleasant. I started off with a full charge and an indicated 338km range and drove fairly hard, revelling in the Curvv EV’s high-speed stability and settled ride. But I kept an eye on my speed – not just to conserve range, but because of the swarm of speed cameras that now dot the Mumbai-Pune Expressway. A single violation can cost you Rs 2,000, and with some sections frustratingly capped at 60kph, avoiding a fine feels almost impossible. Throttle pedal has a large initial dead zone, making it difficult to modulate in stop-go traffic. The 10km climb up the Lonavala Ghat is brutal on an EV’s battery, draining range at an alarming rate. That’s why I wasn’t too concerned when I reached Pimpri with a 46 percent charge and just 140km of range left, despite having 150km to cover on the return journey. The downhill run would help me recoup some charge, and by the time I usually hit the toll plaza at the base of the ghat, my range is often higher than it was 10km earlier. So, I skipped recharging at the Tata Motors factory, eager to find out if the Curvv EV could truly pass the acid test of completing a Mumbai-Pune round trip on a single charge. Turns out, it just about could. I was much gentler on the accelerator on the return trip, toggling between Eco and City modes. In both these modes, you hit an initial dead zone when you press the accelerator pedal, so you miss that instant response EVs are known for. The Curvv EV is much more responsive in Sport mode, but I didn’t want to risk indulging in it with the battery more than half empty. On the drop down from Lonavala to the toll plaza, the electric motor’s regen wasn’t particularly effective, and despite using the strongest L3 regen mode, I couldn’t recoup as much charge as expected and only managed to claw back 2-3km of added range. The Mumbai-Pune round trip proved difficult, with the descent not recouping sufficient charge. It’s likely that the Curvv EV’s brake regeneration is deliberately not too strong because with the car being front-wheel drive, all the regen happens on the front wheels, and the regen strength has been limited to prevent excessive front-end dive. It meant that as I entered the Atal Setu, the SOC dipped below 10 percent, triggering power-saving mode and capping my speed to around 50kph. I moved to the slow lane and had the ignominy of Wagon Rs and Altos overtaking me! I’ve never driven so slowly on the Atal Setu before. I reached the office (and not home, which was another 7km away) with just 6 percent and a huge relief, finally plugging the car into our wall-box charger. Curvv’s aircon cools the cabin effectively, with the express cool working particularly quickly. Living with the Curvv EV has otherwise been painless, and it’s turning out to be an excellent city car. The big standout feature for me is the air-conditioning system. The fixed-scroll aircon compressor is silent, and during an unusually sizzling March, it cooled the cabin brilliantly. For the next few months, the Curvv EV will be my daily driver, and I’m looking forward to seeing how it fares in the long run.

    "description": "There was nothing stopping Skoda from putting a Golf GTI engine in the Kodiaq seven-seat SUV. Should there have been? The Skoda Kodiaq vRS probably wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for the way the Volkswagen group operatesFlexible platforms like Volkswagen’s MQB throw up various ‘why not?’ questions. It means you can have a multi-link axle and adaptive dampers in a otherwise lowly Golf. Because why not? Meanwhile, the clever four-wheel drive system with torque split device had already been developed for the Golf R, so more recently it’s been shared around to the Cupra Leon and Audi S3.Putting the Golf GTI engine into a Skoda Kodiaq for the sporty vRS version, is more of a head-scratcher. A big seven-seat SUV tends to be used more for mooching than haring, so is ideally suited to a torquey plug-in hybrid or diesel powertrain.Indeed, when Skoda launched the Mk1 Kodiaq vRS, it did so with a 237bhp diesel engine. It switched to petrol power when it was facelifted in 2021, and that set-up is reprised for this second-generation car.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/alfa-alpine-cupra-mini-mg-or-mika-who-makes-most-fun-ev",
    "description": "Alfa Romeo, Alpine, Cupra, Mini and MG – which takes the fun EV crown? Electric motoring doesn’t have to be boring. Which of the latest fun-to-drive EVs gets our road testers’ vote? It’s more than 18 months since we first collected a field of affordable electric cars together along with a similar number of Autocar road testers. The aim was to perform some proper back-to-back testing and decide if any – or perhaps how many – of the former could be considered genuinely good fun to drive. Back in 2023, then out of a field of six cars, we found several that were enjoyable to drive, but only one or two of those felt like they existed primarily for the purpose of driver entertainment. Our winner then was a car that would go on to scoop other Autocar group test honours and, in revised form, is likely to set a stiff pace even for this one: the Cupra Born. Now look how the electric car landscape has changed. Over the past 12 months alone, the market for affordable electric cars really has burst into bloom. Leading powers in the mainstream EV market, names such as Hyundai, Kia and Volkswagen, have launched new EV performance sub-brands, while the likes of Alfa Romeo, Abarth, Ford and Alpine are showing that the ‘legacy brands’ can also cater to enthusiasts’ tastes with their zero-emissions offerings. This second running of Autocar’s Best Fun EV test takes in no fewer than three special performance derivatives of both new and well-established compact electric cars. The hotly anticipated and all-new Alpine A290 – tested in top-of-the-line GTS form – is foremost among them, but alongside it is Alfa Romeo’s first EV, the Junior Elettrica Veloce, as well as Cupra’s performance-tuned Born, the VZ. The second-generation electric Mini, the Cooper SE, should give those cars a stern test for energetic driver appeal, while the MG 4 – a car that has been rated by our testers among the best-handling affordable EVs since its first appearance in 2022 – rounds out our line-up, appearing here in Extended Range trim. Read on, then, to discover the most entertaining way to spend sensible money on a new electric car in 2025.  5th – MG 4 This is a classic tale of a fine car damned by high expectations. I say this of it, from the depths of last place in this test, because I feel a touch hurt for the MG 4. Why? Well, it’s really rather good. If you were looking for a well-priced electric family car with a decent range, useful practicality and a long warranty, this would be on your shortlist. And you would hop in it at the dealership, drive it up the road and think ‘Hang on… I’m enjoying myself! The steering is nice, the nose turns in sweetly. I can even feel a fizz of rear-wheel-drive playfulness in faster corners. Joy of joys; my sensible, affordable family car is fun!’ This, dear reader, is precisely what I thought when I first drove the MG 4. It’s still what I think, and it’s what the Autocar road testers thought, as you may have seen from the healthy four-star ‘ride and handling’ and overall rating that it was awarded. And it’s why we included the MG in this test, knowing that it was a great choice for someone who wanted a sensible electric car but also valued a bit of zing thrown into the performance and handling mix. Yet even in its excellent Extended Range guise, the MG 4 came fifth. Not because it isn’t fun within the context of the electric hatchback classes, but because it isn’t fun within the context of fun electric cars – those models that have ‘being fun’ much closer to the top of their to-do list. Flamboyance, style, driver involvement, that intangible sense of naughtiness and rebelliousness… You know. All of that. That’s why I also ranked the MG 4 last (awkward…) despite it being a car that I’d recommend for lots of reasons. But this isn’t a family EV test, is it? It’s a fun EV test. And the MG 4 is a family EV that is, incidentally, quite good fun. It’s not a fun EV that you can, incidentally, also fit your family in. Crucial difference there, but one that scuppers the MG’s chances in a field of more extrovert, enthusiast-targeted offerings. 4th – Alfa Romeo Junior Elettrica The Alfa Romeo Junior Elettrica Veloce’s spec sheet makes for a promising read. Here is a compact hot hatch with 278bhp and a proper mechanical limited-slip differential to make sure as much of that power can reach the road. The front brake discs are a healthy 380mm in diameter and they’re gripped by four-piston calipers. And you get to sit in some comfortably figure-hugging Sabelt bucket seats. On hardware alone, the Alfa should walk this competition. But as you can tell by reading about this car so early into this feature, it doesn’t. The trouble is that Alfa hadn’t finished the job. There’s no doubt that the Junior Veloce is more than quick enough, and in the cold, greasy conditions of our test, it clearly found the best traction out of tight corners. Put your foot down out of a hairpin in the other front-wheel-drive cars and, despite their best traction control trickery, they would want to power understeer, while the Alfa’s diff did its best to hug the apex. It’s an uneven performer, however. The Alfa is very surface-sensitive and would get more deflected than others over bumps. Its steering has neither the Mini’s alacrity nor the polish you will find in the Alpine and the rear-drive cars. Mostly, though, the Alfa suffers from having to share with its Stellantis brothers and sisters. Whereas the Mini and Alpine’s cabins feel bespoke and upmarket, the Alfa can’t hide its Jeep Avenger door cards, hard plastic dash and long-arm, short-leg driving position. And while the best electric driver’s cars are exploring new frontiers of how traction and stability control can enhance the experience, the Alfa is saddled with the same restrictive and non-switchable system as all its platform-mates. The differential has the ability to pull the car out of a corner very effectively with a bit of wheelspin, and the chassis clearly wants to rotate on a trailing ‘throttle’, but the computer says ‘no’ as soon as you’re starting to have too much fun. The people who will appreciate the benefits of this hardware will surely be frustrated by the Alfa’s limitations. Never mind that it’s expensive, the Alfa feels at odds with itself. There’s fun to be had here, but don’t get carried away. 3rd – Mini Cooper SE There’s no shame in coming third, especially given the level of competition here. And with such a heritage of accessible handling prowess, a short wheelbase, a low centre of gravity and a healthy 215bhp, it’s no surprise the Mini Cooper SE made the podium. It even came dressed for the occasion, with its John Cooper Works styling kit. At 1680kg, it’s the third-lightest car here too, and it feels as such to drive: the Mini is all on-its-toes, especially next to the larger, heavier MG. The steering is sharp, reactive and quite well weighted, it tucks in to corners keenly and grips with a tenacity that encourages you to lean on it. What’s more, the minimal body roll means it’s well suited to tight, technical roads: the Mini handles like a car you drive because you choose to, not because you have to. Of the selectable drive modes, two are important here: Core and Go Kart. Each changes the throttle and steering mapping, along with the stability control regime. Go Kart weights up the steering and makes for more immediate, energetic cornering behaviour, while Core – the default setting – makes the handling more intuitive. The Cooper SE has got this whole happy-go-lucky excitable puppy vibe that explains why every judge rated it highly both for charm and overall fun factor. No matter which setting you choose, however, the ride isn’t perfect. It can fidget around on surfaces that aren’t glass-smooth, and while it’s far from harsh or unpleasant, most judges felt the quality of Mini’s damping could be better. The levels of performance on offer are just about competitive with the group. Its 0-62mph time of 6.7sec makes the Mini 0.3sec slower than the Alpine and 0.7sec behind the Alfa; the fastest car in the group – the Born VZ – is more than a second quicker. Having said that, the Cooper SE’s relatively low kerb weight and equally low driving position make it seem faster than the on-paper figures suggest. Under power, however, the (slightly overworked) traction control attempts to keep the scrabbling tyres in check. As you build speed, meanwhile, torque steer briefly ensues and the steering becomes a little wayward – particularly if you’re heading uphill. Generally, the Alpine and Cupra deploy their power better, which, among a couple of judges, dents the Mini’s score for performance and handling appeal. If you’re not trying to flummox it around corners, however, the Mini remains planted and assured as it should, and the brakes are strong but not overly grabby. The pedal could be more progressive, however, especially in the company of the Alpine, but with maximum regen switched on, you don’t have to use them all of the time. In isolation, the Mini’s usable range is good enough, and it didn’t deplete as quickly as we might have expected during a bout of winter road testing: 247 miles is more like 190 miles in everyday driving. But the Mini’s maximum charging speed of 95kW is the slowest here.  This, combined with a small boot and the fact that it’s a strict four-seater, meant most judges marked the Mini down for everyday usability. Those issues aside, however, it’s easy to see the appeal of a Mini and understand why owners are so drawn to the cars. When you’re not trying too hard, it’s a keen-handling performer that possesses enough depth of character and charm to beat every car here, even those that finished above it. It’s almost there, but not quite. 2nd – Cupra Born VZ I was pondering the Cupra Born VZ while gazing at it in our car park near the melancholically scenic and gnarly ‘Broken Road’ – once the A625 to Chapel-en-le-Frith, until Mam Tor shrugged it off and it became a hiking-only route instead. The thing is, one of the big criticisms of the VZ is that it looks much like every other Cupra Born. Sure, you can get some bespoke colours, and it’s badged-up. But even so, how will people know you’ve bought the one with all the power and handling upgrades? The one with 322bhp, the ‘good’ motor from the VW ID 7, the upgraded suspension hardware and adaptive dampers… I mean, the VZ (which stands for ‘Veloz’, or ‘fast’, in Spanish) is proper. It is to the Born what the GTI is to the Golf, and when you’re behind the wheel and in the right mode, it gives you all the feels to make sure you don’t forget it. But where are the design cues to set it apart? It’s like buying a GTI that looks the same as any old Golf. But then… Isn’t that something we used to value in performance cars? The ‘Q-car’ appeal? This led me to Google ‘best Q-cars’, upon which I found a 2017 Autocar article ranking the top 10. Andrew Frankel placed the ‘E28’ BMW M5 as king of the Q-cars. Forgive me for quoting him, here: “To me… its visual ordinariness lies at the heart of its appeal.” As usual, Frankel summed things up perfectly. The parallels between the legendary ’80s M5 (which, by the way, had usefully less power than the VZ overall, yet it predictably managed a 200bhp-per-tonne rating better than the Cupra’s 167bhp per tonne) end there, but the sentiment applies just as well: why do even the mundane cars of today have to come adorned with sports chintz and frippery to spare? Sheep in wolves’ clothing, if you ask me… So, personally, I like the Cupra for its clever trick of looking both understated and modestly aggressive and purposeful. It strikes a nice balance of being desirable without being shouty, while the sense of occasion you get from behind the wheel is just what you want. The Sabelt seats hug you reassuringly, the slim steering wheel feels delicate and lets feedback buzz your fingertips and the rear-wheel-drive layout lets you turn and balance the car on the throttle. The Cupra is a proper laugh out on the Peak District’s winding roads, yet it’s also unintimidating and versatile. The adaptive dampers let you play with the softness levels of the suspension independently, or I favour the pre-determined, full-fat Cupra mode for when the going gets fun, and Normal for, well, the normal stuff. Would I like the screen to be a bit less convoluted? Absolutely. Is this the most expensive car here? Yes – unfortunately, this breadth of ability and usability doesn’t come cheap. And when we were asked to score these cars on charm, well, that’s such a subjective thing, but I found the Cupra lacking on that one. It’s so capable. So appealing. But is it charming? Not really. Not in my book, anyway. Maybe we’re back to the styling again, which I like, but it is very modern and striking rather than having any retro-nostalgia or classic beauty. The Cupra feels like it’s designed to do its job, and while it does it seriously well, I’m not sure it’s evocative or emotional. I would be entirely understanding if you claimed otherwise, but such is the way of trying to rate something as intangible and personal as ‘charm’. I like a granary loaf, you like a crusty white. I think the Mini and Alpine are charming, but the Cupra? Not so much. Different tastes apply, and therein lies the real joy of cars and those who love them. But if we return to more objective measures, the VZ is hard to beat. For a long-way-home car that you can actually get your kids in and which has a useful touring range, a decent boot and a settled ride, this is the best car here. Sure, the most fun car here won, as it should do, and bravo to this year’s champ. But as an overall fun car to live with? You’re looking at the best. Clever stuff, Cupra. And thank you for giving us a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Makes a refreshing change. 1st – Alpine A290 Shock, horror, who’d have thunk it? The bookies’ favourite romps to the top of our final order, overcoming the weight of expectation and delivering a decisive and authoritative victory and a new benchmark for driver reward. Right? Well, no, funnily enough. At least not quite. Success for the Alpine A290 didn’t come so easily over a day’s close scrutiny on proper UK roads – although it came sure enough. It wasn’t a walkover, and the car needed every facet of its appeal as a device for driver entertainment, a retro-cool object of desire and a daily-usable proposition to seal the deal. But the Alpine A290 is indeed Autocar’s Best Fun EV for 2025. There was some dissent and disagreement about the car’s outright dynamic superiority, but in the end, the numbers just about added up in the Alpine’s favour. Only two jurors out of four gave more points to the A290 than to any rival; the other two preferred the Mini Cooper SE, and one of those was by no small margin. But in the end it was completeness and consistency – or, rather, the want of it in other places – that gave the Alpine the win. The judges scored the cars out of 10 across five categories – performance, handling appeal, everyday usability, charm, and all-round fun factor – and while its rivals recorded fours, fives and sixes in places, only in a couple of isolated cases did the A290 score less than seven for anything. This, then, may be the ideal size, price, weight and performance level for a dynamic-handling, compact electric car in 2025; it’s the bullseye compromise, as near, at any rate, as it may currently be hit. And doesn’t it make perfect sense that those old hot hatchback experts in France best understand how to absolutely nail it? Besides its Goldilocks positioning, however, what does the A290 have that its competitors lack? Relative to the Mini (which really might as well be a sports car for how usable it is), you could say five doors and a halfway-spacious boot. Relative to the MG and Alfa Romeo, both the cohesive charm of the A290’s design and the variety, richness and material appeal of its cabin really shine (the Alfa Romeo in particular is conspicuously disappointing on both scores). But compared with all of its gathered opponents, it was the depth and integrity of the A290’s performance engineering that really distinguished it amid the Derbyshire peaks. Those specially developed and tuned, hydraulically bushed, all-independent axles confer a slightly firm-feeling ride at town speeds. But that smooths out to become a really sophisticated degree of B-road composure at speed, one that never feels grabby or tetchy and always keeps the car from feeling cumbersome or heavy. There’s a pervasive and ever-present sense of composed fluency about the Alpine, over crests and through fast corners, that makes it feel special to drive when rivals aren’t. Unlike the Mini, there’s no sense of hyperactivity about the A290 when you really get it moving. It’s a car that inspires loads of confidence and which feels properly sorted, intuitive and on your side, but it’s one that can still mix it with the Mini for outright alertness and agility when the moment comes. The A290’s compactness is a decisive factor in making it a natural entertainer when changing direction, but a really tactile steering rack and a secure but suggestible sort of front-drive handling balance also play their part. There’s too much outright grip and composure here to turn the A290 into some kind of 2020s-era, all-electric tribute to the French hot hatchback greats of the 1980s and 1990s. You have to work quite hard to make it begin to lift-off oversteer, for example, but the A290’s chassis really does know how to come to life on a trailing throttle in any case – and all the more so still when its battery regen toggle has been turned up. I could live without the cheesy ‘OV’ push-to-pass button on the steering wheel – you don’t need to press it in any case once your right foot has passed the accelerator’s kickdown switch. And I would have preferred brake regen paddles to a toggle knob, not to mention other routes, perhaps, to trimming and tweaking the power delivery and keeping you engaged in doling out performance by means other than your big toe. The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N shows the difference such efforts can make. But equally, the simplicity, compactness, lightness, purpose and sophistication of the Alpine A290 are all strengths in their own right, and they add up to a car that’s fully worth the hype. Wildcard - Mika Meon Who brought a crossbow to this laser-powered gunfight? Before we get overexcited about the future of driver’s cars being saved, let’s take a step back. The Alpine, the lightest and, as it turns out, best car here, still weighs nearly 1.5 tonnes – for something that counts as supermini. What if you could have an electric driver’s car that weighs less than half that? The Alpine’s steering, as good as it is, is still influenced by a couple of motors (one for the power steering and one doing the driving) having their say before any feel reaches the driver’s fingertips. What if you could just do away with all that? Why not send the drive to the rear and do away with power steering? And while SUVs are mercifully absent from this contest, none of our mass-produced saviours can completely banish the ‘covered wagon’ feel of sitting on top of, rather than in, the car. After all, you are still sitting on top of a battery pack. What if you could have a proper driving position? Well, you can, even if those kinds of old-school driver’s car values come with a few compromises. If nothing else, though, the Mika Meon is a fascinating thought experiment. The Mika Meon is the brainchild of chassis engineer Robin Hall (who has some fine-handling cars on his CV). It aims to demonstrate both how well an EV can drive when it’s rid of all that weight and how good a beach buggy can be when it’s rid of its Beetle ancestry. There isn’t the space here to cover all of the technical details, so I refer you to road test editor Matt Saunders’ earlier first drive: in short, don’t be fooled by the beach buggy looks; this is a completely custom-built chassis, with the 20kWh of Nio batteries positioned down the spine forming an integral part of the structure. A 215bhp motor sits at the back and there are no driver aids – not even ABS – or power steering. It’s an enticing prospect. Clearly, no one is cross-shopping a Mika with any of our electric hatchbacks. Instead, it’s here in the same capacity as Caterhams at our Britain’s Best Driver’s Car contest: to provide some interesting context and benchmarking. Now, I can’t deny that I have a few misgivings about the Meon that didn’t bother Saunders when he drove it last summer. Not least is that during the single-digit temperatures of our photoshoot, my numbed fingers were much more of a limiting factor on driving range than the small battery capacity. I also struggled with the positioning of the pedals, the implementation of the brake regen and the absence of a limited-slip diff. The steering is something to savour, though. At anything above parking speeds, it’s lovely and light but transmits such delicately detailed messages about the loads going through the chassis that you always know exactly where you’re at. Combine that with the impeccable balance and the nicely pliant ride quality, and it means you can flow this car down a twisty road in a way that’s alien to our group test hatchbacks. In isolation, the Alpine’s steering is great: it is precise, it lets you know when grip is about to run out, and it’s less affected by torque steer than the Mini. But suddenly it feels rather fuzzy and corrupted, making you take a couple of stabs at a corner rather than scribing a neat line. Something else modern performance cars can learn from is the sense of speed you get in the Mika. There’s arguably a bit too much of it as your right ear is rapidly freeze-dried, but it’s reassuring that you can attack a road with gusto, look down at the speedo thinking you might be going a bit too quickly and realise you’re actually nowhere near the speed limit. There’s joy in driving a slow car fast, which is why I prefer our five hatchbacks over the 800bhp super-SUVs that manufacturers seem keen on pushing. But even these cars have enough performance and isolation to make them go unreasonably quickly without having to try too hard, and their makers would be wise to keep everyday fun at the top of the agenda. Comparing a 1479kg front-wheel-drive hatchback with a purpose-built sports car weighing half as much may seem like a cruel thing to do, but while there is still plenty of room for improvement in the current generation of electric cars, you could see that as a positive thing. It’s something to look forward to as battery technology improves and hopefully continues to become lighter and more compact. Just as traditional petrol-powered hot hatches are disappearing or becoming unaffordable (we’re looking at you, £50,000 Civic Type R), there are some great options for electric cars with more than a dash of driver appeal. In the end, none is shown up by the weekend toy, and they’re all daily-drivable with usable range. Do they represent progress compared with a manual gearbox-equipped, naturally aspirated Clio RS200 from 2005? That’s debatable, but the progress that affordable-ish driver’s EVs have made in just three years is pretty spectacular. Things can only get better from here.",

Very few, but that’s the story behind this well-worn 1955 BSA Gold Star. The bike’s current owner used to spot it on the road frequently growing up, intrigued and often wondered who the rider on board was. Many years later he discovered Reinhard Neumair’s workshop on the outskirts of Munich, Germany; imagine his surprise when he saw the fully-faired Gold Star parked there. If you’ve never heard of Reinhard Neumair, it’s probably because he keeps a very low profile.

    "description": "Three-row cars priced under Rs 15 lakh are extremely popular in the Indian market, thanks to their enhanced seating capacity and versatility. We've put together a list of the 10 most affordable SUVs and MPVs that offer three rows of seating - ideal for larger families or those who need the extra space. 1. Renault Triber Rs 6.1 lakh-8.74 lakh 72hp-1.0-litre petrol  The Renault Triber’s mix of practicality and comfort at this price point is simply unmatched. The middle row seats fold 60:40, can be slid back and forth, and the backrest angle is adjustable too. That said, they are recommended for two passengers. Considering it’s a sub-4 metre MPV, things get interesting in the third row of seats. Accessing them is easy after the second-row seats are moved away, and they offer decent space for average-sized passengers. When not in use, the seats can be removed entirely to open up more luggage room. In our Triber review, we found the B-pillar and roof-mounted AC vents for the respective middle and last row travellers reasonably effective on a hot and humid day. Renault Triber featuresHeight adjustable driver’s seatDriver-seat armrestSecond row seats: 60:40 split with slide, recline, fold and tumbleThird row seats: fold and tumble functionSecond and third row AC vents 2. Maruti Ertiga Rs 8.84 lakh-13.13 lakh 103hp-1.5-litre petrol The Maruti Ertiga boasts wide-opening doors, which make ingress and egress easy. Front seats are broad and offer a lot of cushioning, while the second-row seats can be slid back for that extra legroom; also reclinable. The middle row also gets massive windows, which let in more light and provide an airy feel to the cabin. Notably, the seats in the middle only fold and don’t tumble, so accessing the last row may be cumbersome for some. Once at the back, passengers will appreciate the good amount of head and shoulder room on offer. Two adults can sit here on long drives without losing circulation in their legs, and make use of the large side armrests, bottle holders and a charging socket for added convenience. Its Maruti XL6 sibling has a more premium interior but is sold only in a six-seater configuration. Maruti Ertiga featuresHeight adjustable driver’s seatSliding armrest with utility box (front row)Second row seats: 60:40 split with one touch recline and slideSecond row center armrestSecond row roof mounted ACISOFIX seat mounts in second rowThird row flat foldThird row seats: 50:50 split with recline 3. Mahindra Bolero Rs 9.80 lakh-10.91 lakh 76hp-1.5-litre diesel Out of all the cars on this list, the Mahindra Bolero feels the most crude and outdated. Due to its high ground clearance, stepping in and out of the off-roader is not easy. The seats at the front are narrow and don’t have much support on offer; the seats behind are no different either and provide limited knee room. Mahindra has equipped the sub-four metre SUV’s third row with side-facing seats, but they are best left for kids. Quality of touchpoints is below par for a vehicle whose price nudges nearly 10 lakh, that too for the base model. The homegrown brand may fix these issues in the next-generation Bolero, which is currently in development and is expected to launch by 2027. 4. Mahindra Bolero Neo Rs 9.95 lakh-12.16 lakh 100hp-1.5-litre diesel Compared to the Bolero, the Mahindra Bolero Neo feels a class apart in every aspect. The interior, specifically, is a far cry from the standard Bolero, featuring chair-like front seats with long squabs and individual armrests. That said, seat cushioning is firmer here. The middle row seats easily accommodate three passengers. Kneeroom and legroom are not as generous as the headroom, and that is deliberately done by Mahindra to have side-facing jump seats at the back. The three space parameters (kneeroom, legroom and headroom) are non-existent in the last row of seats and they are best left folded to make room for more luggage. Mahindra Bolero Neo featuresHeight adjustable driver’s seatFront armrests for driver and co-driverSecond row seats: foldArmrest in seconds rowISOFIX seat mounts in second rowThird row jump seats: fold 5. Toyota Rumion Rs 10.54 lakh-13.83 lakh 103hp-1.5-litre petrol The Toyota Rumion is a badge-engineered version of the Maruti Ertiga, and its interior closely mirrors that of the MPV. From the overall design and layout to the beige colour scheme, the cabin feels familiar and functional. All three rows offer comfortable seating, and the space is packed with storage compartments, enhancing practicality. Buyers choosing the Rumion over the Ertiga may also benefit from a shorter wait time. Toyota Rumion featuresHeight adjustable driver’s seatSliding armrest with utility box (front row)Second row seats: 60:40 split with one touch recline and slideSecond row center armrestSecond row roof mounted ACISOFIX seat mounts in second rowThird row seats: 50:50 split with reclineThird row flat fold 6. Kia Carens Rs 10.60 lakh-19.70 lakh 115hp-1.5-litre petrol, 160hp-1.5-litre turbo petrol, 116hp-1.5-litre diesel The Kia Carens’ cabin scores top marks for its premium quotient, with comfort being a strong point across all three rows. Seats at the front are well-cushioned and offer a great view out. Practicality is thoughtfully addressed too, with a storage tray under the co-driver’s seat. In the second row, the 60:40 split seats can tumble and fold, but the kerbside seat adds an extra touch of convenience with an electrically-assisted mechanism operated by a button, making access to the third row a breeze. While the middle-seat passenger benefits from the near-flat floor on long journeys, those seated by the windows will enjoy the added comfort of factory-fitted retractable sunshades. Our Carens review reported the last row seats to be comfy and not as knees-up as other MPVs of its class. Passengers as tall as six feet can enjoy reasonable comfort here.  Kia Carens featuresHeight adjustable driver’s seatVentilated front seats; back table with cup holder and gadget mountSecond row seats: 60:40 split with slide, recline and tumbleSecond row seat one touch easy electric tumbleSecond row sunshadesISOFIX seat mounts in second rowRoof-mounted second and third row AC vents withThird row seats: 50:50 split seats with recline and flat fold 7. Citroen Aircross Rs 12.46 lakh-14.35 lakh 82hp-1.2-litre petrol, 110hp-1.2-litre turbo petrol The French carmaker is known for offering comfy seats in its cars, and the Citroen Aircross is a testament to just that. First row seats are well-cushioned and supportive; the driver’s seat also gets an armrest. Though the middle row 60:40 split seats also prioritise comfort, they miss out on a central armrest and backrest recline function. The kerbside seat can be tilted and tumbled away to get into the last row. Since the seats here are placed on the boot floor, passengers sit in a knees-up position. Headroom and kneeroom are not generous either, meaning that this space is best suited for kids. These seats can also be removed, just like the Triber, to free up more luggage space. Citroen AircrossHeight adjustable driver’s seatFront console armrest (sliding) with storageSecond row seats: 60:40 splitSecond row AC ventsISOFIX seat mounts in second row 8. Mahindra Scorpio Classic Rs 13.62 lakh-17.50 lakh 130hp-2.2-litre diesel Thanks to its high ground clearance, getting into the Mahindra Scorpio Classic needs some effort. A high seating position gives a great view of the surroundings, and the front chair-like seats, upholstered in fabric, are reminiscent of previous models and come with armrests. Headroom is generous, and the second-row bench easily accommodates three passengers. However, the long seat squab may reduce the under-thigh support for some. At the back, Mahindra has included side-facing jump seats similar to those in the Bolero and Bolero Neo, but they lack seat belts and provide no crash protection. Buyers also have the option of captain setas in the second row and bench seat at the back, though the absence of rear air vents is a notable omission in both versions. Mahindra Scorpio Classic featuresHeight adjustable driver’s seatFront seat armrestsSecond row AC ventsThird row removable seats (captain chairs variant) 9. Mahindra Scorpio N Rs 14 lakh-24.90 lakh 203hp-2.0-litre turbo petrol, 132hp-175hp-2.2-litre diesel The Mahindra Scorpio N is a clear step up from the Classic in every aspect. It features leatherette upholstery that feels far more premium, and the seats are more relaxed. The front seats are generously cushioned as well and offer plenty of lumbar support, even at their lowest setting. In the second row, the 60:40 split bench seat (captain chairs available in Z8 L top model) folds and tumbles on the kerbside; the right-hand side seat only folds. Although they can’t be slid, there’s tremendous kneeroom as well as headroom available here. Unlike the Classic’s jump seats, the Scorpio N gets a conventional set of front-facing seats with seatbelts in the last row, resulting in a more convenient seating experience. That said, adults will sit in a knees-up position, and space is extremely limited. Also, no AC vents are present here. Mahindra Scorpio N featuresDriver’s seat: six-way electrically adjustable, lumbar support and height adjustableVentilated Seats (driver and co-driver)Second row seats: one touch tumbleSecond row AC ventsISOFIX seat mounts in second rowThird row seats: fold and tumble 10. Mahindra XUV700 Rs 14.50 lakh-25.90 lakh 200hp-2.0-litre turbo petrol, 155hp-185hp-2.2-litre diesel The Mahindra XUV700 boasts an airy cabin with cream leatherette upholstery. Seats at the front are large and well-cushioned, making long journeys comfortable, as noted in our XUV700 review. The same is true for the middle row 60:40 split seats, and despite the panoramic sunroof's thick frame eating a bit into the headroom, tall passengers will be comfy here. Adding to the comfort, the co-driver seat comes with a manual ‘boss mode’ lever at the back, allowing the rear passenger to unlock extra legroom. Mahindra also offers five and six-seat configurations in select XUV700 models. Entry to the third row is made by split-folding the kerbside seat. Like in the Scorpio N, space in the third row is limited, but dedicated AC vents is a welcome touch. Mahindra XUV700 featuresDriver’s seat: six-way electrically adjustable, lumbar support and height adjustable, memory functionVentilated seats (driver and co-driver)Front centre armrest with storageSecond row seats: 60:40 split with one-touch tumbleThird row seats: 50:50 split with reclineThird row AC ventsISOFIX seat mounts in second row Also, see: 10 most affordable SUVs, MPVs with second row captain seats Every compact car with a 10 inch touchscreen or larger Every diesel automatic SUV under Rs 25 lakh in India",
