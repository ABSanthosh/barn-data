    "description": "This 1995 Porsche 911 Carrera RS is one of approximately 1,014 examples produced for the 1995 and 1996 model years, and it was sold new via Mizwa Motors in Japan. It was imported to the US by the selling dealer under the NHTSA Show or Display exemption in 2013 and was subsequently federalized by JK Technologies of Baltimore, Maryland, before it was purchased by the current owner later that year. The car is finished in Polar Silver Metallic over two-tone black and gray leather upholstery, and power comes from a 3.8-liter flat-six mated to a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Equipment includes a seam-welded body shell, an aluminum hood, front and rear spoilers, 18″ Speedline multi-piece wheels, a front strut tower bar, air conditioning, power-operated windows, front airbags, and a Porsche CDR-220 head unit. This 993 Carrera RS shows 43k kilometers (~27k miles) and is now offered on dealer consignment as part of the Gruppe P collection with Japanese-language factory literature, tools, a removed Japanese-market radio, import documents, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a Massachusetts title.",

That’s true in Coupe form and now is our chance to try it as a convertible, or the Spider in Ferrari-speak.The 12Cilindri Spider is the folding-topped version of Ferrari’s grandest V12 tourer, which will go on UK sale this autumn and cost from £366,500 before you specify a single option, and you can bet a Ferrari retailer will encourage you to do that.With the SF90 as the brand’s performance leader, it meant that, when developing the 12Cilindri, Ferrari was able to lean into its grand touring capabilities more than it had in the recent past. It didn’t need to be the most powerful, most focused car in the range. But, as we’ll see, it is still incredibly potent, fast, and rewarding to drive.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/morgan-supersport-plus-six-replacement-be-revealed-march",
    "description": "Plus Six successor (pictured) retains classic styling cues... Flagship sports car will use a new aluminium platform and BMW-sourced turbocharged six-pot engine The successor to the Morgan Plus Six will be called Supersport - and the flagship sports car will be revealed on March 11. The news was confirmed today by the British car maker in a social media post with TV personality Richard Hammond (see below). First pictures of the car were shown last month. These revealed it as a rakish coupé, melding the classical styling of the Plus Six and its four-cylinder Plus Four sibling with elements of the Aero cars that bowed out in 2018. Notably, it has a long, sloping tail, similar to that on the Aeromax. Morgan said the new flagship uses a new platform evolved from the Plus Six's current bonded-aluminium structure and that it too will use a BMW-sourced turbocharged six-cylinder engine. The Plus Six’s departure will be marked by the Plus Six Pinnacle, which is limited to just 30 examples and adopts design cues from the striking Pininfarina-styled Midsummer that was unveiled in 2024. The Worcestershire-based firm will also use the £96,995, 3.0-litre straight-six-powered Pinnacle to demonstrate its expanding bespoke programme, which offers “almost limitless” options. The Supersport will arrive later this year as a two-seat sports car that forgoes use the traditional ‘wing silhouette’ of today’s four-wheeled Morgans.   NEWS: We are excited to announce that our forthcoming flagship model, the new Morgan Supersport, will be officially unveiled on March 11th.Hosted by Morgan owner @RichardHammond, the reveal event will take place in the workshops at our Pickersleigh Road factory (1/2) pic.twitter.com/UqtzAACqT1 — Morgan Motor Company (@morganmotor) February 24, 2025   The best-selling four-cylinder Plus Four – which has recently been outselling the Plus Six by roughly two to one – will be left to continue the brand’s traditional vintage styling, which started with the 4/4 back in 1936. Morgan has previously signalled its interest in producing a model that advances its vintage look into what design chief Jonathan Wells calls “the jet age”. For the new flagship, it seems more likely that Morgan will use lessons from the limited-edition Midsummer to produce a considerably more exclusive and upmarket model, clearly differentiated from the Plus Four, that will justify higher prices and more interest in the firm’s bespoke programme. Some people inside Morgan have been calling for this move for some time as rivals take similar approaches, Autocar understands. The BMW engine used by the Plus Six currently makes 335bhp but is thought to be reliably capable of considerably higher outputs. Even at its current power rating, the Plus Six can hit 60mph from rest in 4.2sec and exceed 160mph. Extra power, perhaps as much as 380bhp, could easily lift performance further towards supercar levels. Q\u0026A: Matthew Hole, Morgan's managing director How would you describe Morgan’s priorities? “We need to continue broadly in the direction we’re travelling. But we have recently seen the success of Midsummer, our limited-edition project with Pininfarina, and I’d say we definitely need more of that. I have also had three years working with Jon Wells and his amazing design team, and I reckon they need to be unleashed a bit more on things you might not have expected.” Does that mean different-looking Morgans in future? “There’s definitely space out there for new models that don’t look the same as the Morgans of old – as long as we also meet the expectations of our traditional customers: that’s one reason we’re keen to maintain and expand our coachbuilding skills. Our cars’ underpinnings have come a long way, but there’s catching up to do with some of the exterior. Coachbuilding allows you a lot of flexibility. Do we need more high-tech Morgans?  “We’re in no hurry to dump a lot of forward-facing technology into the cars, especially if it doesn’t add to the analogue driving experience. We’ve been doing mostly subtle mechanical stuff, like enhanced ride and handling. We’ll probably continue on that line.”",

We’d bang a left and head south into Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado, stopping at some of the West’s most iconic locations: Yellowstone, Grand Tetons, Rocky Mountains, and the Great Salt Lake. Then, we would put together an entire issue from the experience.

    "description": "It’s a pleasantly nippy morning, and I’ve just set off on a flashy red/black Aprilia Tuono 457. I’m in Sport mode with traction control switched off before I get going because it’s been a long time since I’ve been aboard an Aprilia Tuono, and I’m itching to have some fun. I stop at the side of the road as the convoy of Tuono 457s being piloted by other journalists passes me by, and I find myself smiling ear-to-ear as that lovely twin-cylinder soundtrack reverberates through the area. With the road empty and visor down, I plonk the Tuono in first and give it a prodigious handful of throttle, and immediately, the front wheel comes up! I almost run into the rev limiter as I shift into second, and again, the Tuono points skyward – we’re in for a thrilling day! Aprilia Tuono 457 design, differences from RS 457 To create the Tuono, Aprilia ditched the RS 457’s fairing, clip-ons and signature tri-lamp headlight setup in favour of a small new headlight and a handlebar. While the Tuono’s LED headlight isn’t as pretty as that of the RS, I do find it growing on me the more I look at it.  The headlight’s design grows on you with time. Aprilia’s technical team has also reprofiled the tank slightly for a little more lock-to-lock clearance and to accommodate the new handlebar, thereby reducing the fuel capacity by a marginal 300ml to 12.7 litres.  Aprilia has reprofiled the tank to accommodate the taller handlebar. The company has also shortened the final drive gearing with a one-tooth larger rear sprocket on the Tuono and given the bike rubber-mounted footpegs (in the same position as the RS), both of which are helpful when riding on the road. Unlike the RS, its footpegs have rubber tops. Since the Tuono’s chassis is the same as the RS, you may wonder why it weighs the exact same 175 kilos when it has a lot less bodywork. Aprilia engineers informed me that the Tuono’s smaller headlight actually weighs a fair deal more than the RS’ larger (but sleeker) unit, and the handlebar and its accoutrements make up for the RS’ fairing, which weighs just 3 kilos.  Aprilia Tuono 457 comfort, handling, city usability On the road, especially our far-from-ideal ones, the Tuono is a much better place to be than the RS because you sit almost upright with a slight bend toward the handlebar. Since the suspension travel and tuning are exactly the same as the RS – which means this is a stiffly sprung bike – the upright riding position makes road imperfections much more bearable. And that added comfort hasn’t come at the expense of the RS’ sublime handling. I’ll wager that, on the road, you’ll not miss the more focused ergonomics of the RS because this Tuono felt just as eager and composed as its faired sibling when attacking corners.  The Tuono 457 marries all-day comfort and engaging performance beautifully. The cherry on top is that the Tuono is also an absolute peach when handling the rigours of the concrete jungle. The parallel-twin engine that powers this bike was already very smooth with gobs of low and mid-range grunt, and with the shorter gearing, things only got better. You can pull away from a dead stop in second gear without protestation, and 45kph in sixth is devoid of any knocking. And despite the shorter gearing, you can comfortably cruise at 120kph (even 140 isn’t too bad except for the windblast) in top gear. And as I’ve said before, the Tuono is more than happy if you want to travel everywhere on just one wheel! So, is this a perfect bike?  Twin-cylinder engine is flexible, punchy and smooth. Aprilia Tuono 457 areas of improvement The Tuono 457 comes very close to being perfect but stops a few yards short. For one, at this price, the exclusion of adjustable levers and sintered brake pads seems like an avoidable oversight, although both are easy fixes for not a lot more money. And – we’ve said this for the RS 457, too – the quickshifter (sets you back a cool Rs 20,050) should be standard on the Tuono at its Rs 3.95 lakh sticker price. It’s also sad that this new naked design doesn’t offer the same looks and wind protection as the traditional semi-faired design theme seen on other Tuonos, setting it apart from most naked bikes.  Its dash is shared with the RS and has loads of features and tech.   Aprilia Tuono 457 price and verdict   But, in the grand scheme of things, these are minor niggles, which should tell you how good and rounded a package the Tuono 457 is. It can handle anything you throw at it on the road – be it carving corners, touring the country, or just commuting to work – while keeping you reasonably comfortable and engaged. For what it packs, its Rs 3.95 lakh price (Rs 25,000 less than the RS) is also reasonable, and the Tuono has no real direct rival.   Aside from the flashy red/black option, there's also a subtly classy white/grey colour. As I’m sure is clearly evident by now, this bike has me smitten, just like my own previous Tuono V4, and I’m seriously considering spending my money on it. If, like me, you enjoy fast and sporty yet reasonably comfortable machines, then the Tuono 457 warrants serious consideration. Also See: Aprilia Tuono 457 video review",

    "description": "There’s little doubt the Hyundai Ioniq 5, our 2024 Car of the Year, is one of the best cars Hyundai has put to market in recent times. Part of this is because it breaks new ground and seamlessly integrates modern EV tech into regular everyday motoring. Using the Ioniq 5 for the past couple of months has literally been transformative. The large 72.6kWh battery and good efficiency of 5.5-6.0km per kWh in Eco mode allow me to charge the battery once a week at work (six hours at 11kW). What makes the Ioniq 5 experience even more seamless is that it is such a comfortable and easy car to live with. It gives between 440km and 460km on a full charge when driven in Mumbai traffic. Sure, it’s wide, and that does take some getting used to in congested Mumbai traffic, but what gets the corners of my mouth to curl up is that it does such a good job almost everywhere else. Take the supple and absorbent ride for instance – near perfect for Mumbai’s lunar roads; the superb sound insulation that creates a hush inside the cabin despite a wedding procession outside, the very comfortable and almost armchair-like seats, which can be adjusted at the front and rear, or the fact that even in Eco mode, the Ioniq 5 has enough zip. And Eco also gives me a range between 420km and 440km on a single charge. It’s big and wide, so squeezing into tight parking slots isn’t always easy. On sections where there are multiple speed cameras, I use the ADAS, which works great so long as the cameras can see the lane markings clearly. It even drives the tight corner inside the Coastal Road tunnel perfectly, slows down for slower traffic ahead, comes to a full stop, and starts up again without any input from the driver. You have to hold the steering wheel, of course; otherwise, the car puts out a warning. You can have Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, but only if you carry a wire. What I do miss is having wireless Apple CarPlay, a definite pain point as I use Google Maps every day for route selection. The faster route is 15-20 minutes quicker, at times. Other pet peeves include the dull fascia and the lack of a spare tyre, and when you really begin to enjoy driving this rear-wheel-drive version with its sharpish front end and direct steering, the long-travel, soft rear suspension lets you down. I do like the fact that the centre console slides back and allows the driver to exit from the left door quite easily; this helps when you need to park this really wide EV. The best bit is that it’s an EV that is both characterful and charming. Good-quality rubber helps deliver both direct steering and a comfy ride.   Also See: Hyundai Ioniq 5 long term review, 19,500km report Hyundai Ioniq 5 long term review, 15,900km report",

    "description": "It’s one of those days when I’m glad I get to do what I do. The day starts off like any other, getting up at way-too-early o’clock, driving to the shoot location and reviewing a car. But what’s making it different is the car. Way before the sun comes up, I’m already at the location. I hear a deep grumble approaching, and I see the six LED light signatures, followed by a sleek silhouette cutting through the dark. Now, I had promised myself I wouldn’t make any James Bond references, but this really feels straight out of one of those legendary films. Aston Martin Vantage exterior design Borrows design cues from DB12, One-77 As the sun comes up, I get my first proper look at the Vantage, this one being finished in a beautiful shade called Ion Blue. The new Aston Martin Vantage commands your attention, irrespective of what you make of its looks. It borrows a lot of styling cues from bigger Astons, like the new DB12 and the One-77 supercar, and, in general, is a lot more aggressive-looking than the outgoing car. The biggest change is at the front, with larger LED Matrix headlamps, a larger grille, new air curtains on the outer edges of the bumper and a more sculpted bonnet. Full of gorgeous details, like these strakes. 21-inch wheels The rest of the car is largely unchanged; it still has a vent on the fenders, which helps remove turbulent air from the wheel wells, but it now features a side strake with the Aston Martin lettering. There’s new wheel options, with this one riding on 21 inchers with the optional black brake calipers. I also love the look of the mirrors, whose entire housing moves, rather than just the glass, and the large side skirts. The Vantage also has a ground clearance of 94mm, which may not sound like much, but with short overhangs and a small wheelbase, relatively speaking, it’s very capable at tackling speed breakers. In fact, getting to the shoot location involves going over around 10 speed breakers and some really rough patches of road, and surprisingly, the Vantage doesn’t scrape its belly even once. And that’s without a front axle lift system - commendable! It’s wider; has more aero and larger exhaust tips. 30mm wider from before Around the back, it still retains the now-iconic Vantage light signature, but it’s 30mm wider than before. Aston Martin says that the underbody aero, the diffuser and the ducktail spoiler have all been revised for more downforce, and the quad exhaust tips are now larger. It also has a properly usable boot and can easily swallow up your luggage for a weekend road trip. Getting into the cabin is an event. It’s got the swan doors, like you’d expect from an Aston that not only look cool sweeping slightly upwards but also help avoid contact with curbs and footpaths. Inside, I’m greeted by a completely new interior that looks and feels much more modern and driver-focused than the outgoing car’s. Aston Martin Vantage interior and features Digital cluster has nice graphics, but the data appears too small. 10.25-inch touchscreen and driver's display  There are two 10.25-inch screens – one for the instrument cluster and another for the infotainment. The touchscreen is set low and at an angle in the centre console and features nice graphics, while the instrument panel is set in a sporty binnacle. However, some of the data appears too small to read on the go. The new interior is more driver-centric and gets more tech; seat controls fall easily to hand. ADAS added The angled centre console has a myriad of buttons and switches, all of which are finished beautifully, and they control various aspects of the car. Then there are the optional Sports Plus seats, which are comfy and supportive and are finished in a lovely soft leather. A shoutout also goes to the optional ‘Oxford Tan’ upholstery this car features, which really complements the exterior colour well. Practicality is also decent by supercar standards, as it does get a glovebox, some space behind the seats, slim door pockets and a wireless charger under the centre console. And yes, it packs in ADAS tech now. Endless customisation options This test car is also equipped with options such as carbon-fibre trim, blue contrasting stitching, a sports steering wheel and satin dark chrome ‘interior jewellery’ - all of which undoubtedly look pretty but cost a pretty penny. And the possibilities to customise your Vantage are endless. Overall, the interior feels special, and the quality and finish are top-notch, marking a step up from the outgoing car. Aston Martin engine and performance AMG’s 665hp V8 now puts out 30 percent more power. 0-100kph takes 3.5 seconds; 325kph top speed The engine is one of the stand out elements of the car. The Mercedes-AMG-sourced 4.0-litre, twin-turbo V8 has been tuned to put out supercar numbers – 665hp and 800Nm – which is 30 percent more than its predecessor. This propels it from 0-100kph in a claimed 3.5 seconds and on to a top speed of 325kph. And what stands out apart from the wild performance is the noise. This V8 burbles at idle, makes some great intake and turbo whooshing sounds on the move, and there’s delightful exhaust cracks and pops on downshifts. There is some turbo lag, and the meat of the power band is between 3,000rpm and 5,500rpm, but it pulls relentlessly till its 7,000rpm redline. A stiffer chassis and quicker steering make it feel much more agile than the older Vantage. Misses out on a GT mode There are three drive modes to choose from – Sport, Sport+ and Track – all of which alter throttle response, steering weight, damper stiffness and exhaust volume. However, there’s no GT mode, like on the bigger DB12 or the DBX SUV, so Sport is the mode to be in for everyday use. It’s in this mode where the Vantage feels its most relaxed and supple, but it isn’t as relaxed or pliant as some other supercars out there. Sport+ dials things up further with more response and noise, and it’ll even allow some playful action from the rear end without being dangerous. Track mode, however, is best saved for, well, the track. In this mode, the Vantage feels like a sportscar that the brand says it is, with a very firm suspension, sharp responses and twitchy handling out on a public road. You really have to have your wits about you to use this mode on tight public roads. And best reserved for a track, there’s nine settings for the traction control, so you can choose how much slip you want from the rear. Torque converter is smooth Paired to the V8 is an 8-speed ZF torque converter automatic gearbox that gets a shorter final drive ratio. It’s fairly quick, but it doesn’t have the lightning responses or that small but noticeable shunt you get from DCTs - something you’d expect from a sportscar. But the Vantage isn’t an all-out sportscar, and the torque converter’s smoothness actually complements its GT characteristics and makes it much nicer to drive at saner speeds. Having driven the Vantage through smaller village roads, too, I got a good idea about its ride and handling balance. The ride is firm and, though, not jarring, and given its touring abilities, a more pliant GT setting would have been welcome. The refinement could also have been better as you do get some road and tyre noise inside the cabin. In terms of handling, apart from being wider, the new Vantage is stiffer, thanks to additional cross bracing at both axles and in the floor. With the engine sat behind the front axle, it’s got a perfect 50:50 weight distribution; the quicker steering and more aero means it’s much more agile, planted and responsive around corners than the older Vantage. Aston Martin price and verdict Priced at Rs 4.20 crore (ex-showroom, before options), the new Vantage currently sits in a space of its own, between the Porsche 911 Turbo S at the lower end and the Ferrari Roma above it. And that goes for its positioning, too. It’s in a pretty unique spot; a front-engined, two-seat sportscar is rare. It’s got beautiful lines, aural drama, ferocious performance like a proper sports car, is usable over a wide variety of roads, can tackle speed breakers, and has the ability to carry your weekend luggage. Think of it as a sports car with some GT abilities or a GT with sports car capabilities – the latter is what I’m leaning towards. This is what makes it such good sense for India.

    "description": "A fully electric E-Class is in the works and will be available by 2027, Mercedes-Benz confirmed during its Capital Market Day presentation. The electric sedan's launch in India could also happen later. Competing with Tesla and BMW, this new E-Class EV is expected to offer premium features and an extended range. The German marque also shared details about the S-Class facelift and a smaller derivative of the G-Class, which we have previously reported. Uniform design for petrol, diesel and electric four-wheelers E-Class EV to be larger than its ICE equivalent Smaller G-Class SUV to be called g for differentiation Mercedes E-Class electric details To pack Level 3 ADAS suite Representational image The teaser of the electric Mercedes sedan boasted a similar silhouette to the E-Class on sale at the moment and may blend elements from both its combustion-engine counterpart and next-generation Mercedes electric cars. This new E-Class EV will be larger than its ICE counterpart and feature advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) up to Level 3. It may arrive as a replacement for the EQE Sedan sold overseas and be sold alongside the E-Class petrol and diesel models. In India, Mercedes sells just the E-Class LWB, which is priced from Rs 78.5 lakh to 92.5 lakh. Mercedes S-Class facelift slated for 2026, EV by 2030 S-Class ICE and EV to be sold alongside in the coming years Representational image Featuring tech and styling updates, the facelifted S-Class is unlikely to receive changes in the existing set of powertrains. Customisation options with the 2026-bound luxury sedan will be expanded via the Mercedes Manufaktur range. The respective prices of the S 350d (diesel) and S 450 (petrol) are Rs 1.79 crore and Rs 1.89 crore, and a slight price increase is likely with the updated limousine. Additionally, Mercedes stated that an S-Class electric sedan is being considered and will arrive by the end of 2030.  Mercedes G-Class but smaller It is called 'g' instead of 'G' This is not the first time that the automaker has talked about developing a smaller version of its G-Class SUV. With the launch of the G-Class electric (officially called G 580 with EQ Technology), it is evident that Mercedes wants to expand its SUV line-up. The new SUV will get an internal combustion engine (ICE) and all-electric powertrains along with a four-wheel drive. Mercedes may also offer the 'baby’ G as a plug-in hybrid in some international markets. For differentiation, the nameplate of the upcoming mini G-Class will read ‘g’ instead of ‘G’. Just like the S-Class facelift, the Manufaktur package will be on offer here. For reference, the G 580 has a Rs 3 crore price tag, while the AMG G 63 is pricier at Rs 3.64 crore.  Mercedes GLC EV and C-Class EV to launch in 2026 Both electric vehicles are part of the brand's 'core luxury' faction  2026 will also see the arrival of the Mercedes GLC electric SUV and C-Class EV. The upcoming electric version of the GLC and C-Class will sit in the 'core luxury' segment, currently occupied by the likes of the CLE and E-Class globally. Both may be underpinned by the MMA platform, which will be used in the new CLA sedan.

    "link": "",
    "description": "\"The sum of its parts represents something that simply doesn't exist in the modern world anymore, and I had no clue what that was when I got it.\" David Steca didn’t need a project car he needed a daily driver. To the lot of us, that means something sensible and reliable, a car that you can use without thinking about it. To David it meant something steeped in function and style, that could be stuffed with camera gear, and handle complex filming rigs. A workhorse that would help him document stories, not only here for Petrolicious but for his own wrenching and exploration based automotive Youtube channel: Only a Roadtrip Away.    It could have been a simple choice of a simple car. There were plenty of options, cars with air conditioning, modern safety features, dead on reliability, and zero surprises. But David isn’t wired that way. Instead of a practical choice like Volkswagen Golf he bought a Peugeot 205 GTI, a 40 year old hot hatch. An odd choice for a daily, perhaps, but a valiant one. And if you roll the clock all the way back to the 80’s, it was as obvious then as it is now.  The 205 GTI was a working-class hero of 1980’s France, a true product of its era. It took what the Volkswagen GTI started and pushed things a bit farther. Where the GTI was predictable and planted, the 205 GTI was nervous and eager, rewarding drivers who knew how to handle its infamous lift-off oversteer. When it launched in 1984, it was designed to be a workhorse with a wild streak, a car that could handle the daily grind and still make a grocery run feel like a rally stage. For the French, it was practical but never boring, a commuter car with a backbone, something that could slip through tight Parisian streets during the week and carve up back roads on the weekend. It found a home with young professionals, tradesmen; collars but no ties. It wasn’t precious. It was just good. In a way, David is exactly who Peugeot had in mind when they built it. He was just 40 years too late to snag one off the assembly line.  This Peugeot, however, wasn’t a hero, not yet. The brakes were seized, the engine was a nightmare of misrouted hoses and mismatched parts, and nothing worked the way it should. “In the state that I bought it in, it wasn't drivable at all. The brakes were sticking. Everything was just old and cruddy,” David says. He doesn’t sound annoyed or frustrated, he sounds interested, like the car’s condition was, and would be just another part of its story, and his. Sourcing original parts became a treasure hunt, each find bringing the car one step closer to its former glory. Late nights in the garage, poring over manuals and tinkering with the engine, became routine. The goal was clear: transform the Peugeot into a dependable daily driver, something he could trust. It wasn’t about chasing perfection, itwas about striking the right balance between preserving what was there and replacing what was beyond saving. “There's no shortcut. You have to go through everything,” he says.  The 205 GTI rewards that kind of attention. It’s not a fast car by today’s standards, but it feels quick within it’s context. It asks you to be present, to engage. “Every bit of control that this vehicle has is analog,” David says. “You brake way later or you don’t brake at all and you turn way sharper than you would normally do.” There’s nothing digital to filter the experience. It demands a certain kind of dedication, or loyalty, and if you don’t give those, it won’t give anything back. David’s approach to getting the Peugeot going wasn’t about achieving perfection. It was about understanding the car for what it was and bringing out the best in it. There’s a humility in that, and an honesty in giving the car its purpose back. When he talks about the car, it’s clear he discovered more than he expected. Now, the humble hatchback is not only David's daily driver, but his on set workhorse, a humble partner in his film creations here in Petrolicious, on his own Youtube channel, and elsewhere.  This 205 GTI isn’t only a tool for getting from A to B, despite David’s original intent. It’s a shade of his life philosophy. David isn’t interested in rushing or forcing things into place. He lets stories, whether on film or on the road, unfold naturally. He works through what’s in front of him, trusts the process, and knows that if he does it right, the end result will speak for itself.  Continue...",

Built in 1896 as a wooden retreat for America’s elite, it was a beacon of wealth and exclusivity, until a kitchen fire consumed it in 1903.The owners rebuilt bigger, and grander, determined to make it even more opulent. But again in 1925, disaster struck, this time from something as trivial as an electric curling iron left on in a guest room. The flames ripped through the wooden structure, reducing it to embers once more.  Rather than admit defeat, the owners made sure it would never happen again. Inspired by the great Renaissance palaces of Italy, they rebuilt The Breakers in fire-proof stone, and marble. They wanted its legacy to last for generations.  That same spirit of preservation of legacy, reinvention, of perseverance, makes it the perfect stage for a sold out crowd Cavallino Classic, where Ferrari’s past and present meet in a curated display of mechanical art and automotive obsession.  Walking through the resort and then stepping out onto the 13th hole, it’s clear: this isn’t just another car show. The event was the biggest ever for organizers despite the layout itself reflecting a tight and quite exclusive capacity for cars. The lauded 250 GTO, of course stood commandingly, quietly, at the peak of the display.  The meticulously curated lineup of Ferrari’s greatest hits, F40s, Enzos, LaFerraris, formed the next tier, blue-chip collectibles that define generational milestones. Beyond that, the broader field of concours entrants stretched across the 13th green.  It’s easy to assume that Cavallino is just a playground for the ultra-rich, and it absolutely is, but that’s a lazy and pretty myopic take. Yes, these cars are enormously valuable. Yes, the event is very exclusive. But what stands out beyond the wealth, is the obsession. Talk to the attendees, and you realize just how deep the passion runs. These aren’t absentee collectors. They’re historians, archivists, curators of the Ferrari’s DNA. They don’t just know their car’s production numbers, they know who ordered it, and when. Where it’s been, how it was optioned, and what color thread was used in the interior stitching. Many of the participants care. Deeply. Cavallino isn’t just a concours; it’s a gathering of true believers. Dare to say, these are some absolutely ultimate car nerds. The Cavallino Classic isn’t just about \"owning\" a Ferrari. That’s why the judging process at at the event is taken so seriously. 70 out of 104 cars registered for judging this weekend achieved a 97 out of 100, earning them a best of show accolade.  Winning here isn’t just a physical trophy, it’s validation, and a stamp of approval from some of the most ruthless and knowledgeable judges on the planet. Ferrari historians, restorers, and experts are flown in from the U.S. and Europe, all working under the strict rules of the IAC/PFA, which, for the uninitiated, is the International Advisory Committee for the Preservation of the Ferrari Automobile. Basically, if you’re restoring a Ferrari and want it done right, these are the people you don’t want to disappoint. If they're happy. You're happy. Passing muster here adds weight to a car’s history, increases its value, and cements its place in Ferrari lore. A platinum award means that a panel of the world’s most discerning judges has picked your car apart and deemed it worthy.  In addition to well versed judges, Enzo Mattioli Ferrari, a direct descendant of the legendary Enzo Ferrari, partner and president of Cavallino Classic, and grandson of Piero Ferrari, attended the event. This added serious weight to not only the awards given, but the event itself.  “I strongly believe in the Cavallino project, and for this reason, I am excited to participate in its development and growth, not just with financial investment, but with strategic involvement,” said Enzo Mattioli Ferrari upon being named President of Cavallino. On display are cars both new and old. As of late, Ferrari’s latest hypercars, like the F80, the 12Cilindri, or even the Purosangue, don’t have that same immediate recognition outside the die-hard enthusiast circle as some of the legends of the past. Ferrari has leaned into hyper-exclusivity, and while that strengthens its brand prestige, it’s also pulling it further out of reach for the next generation. The F80, the current flagship is one of those cars. Batted about a bit in the media, it certainly doesn’t get justice it deserves. Photos don't do the trick. In person, it’s commanding, aggressive, a statement piece of design and engineering. But was it the standout of the councours? Maybe. Maybe not. It had a presence, no doubt. A modern Ferrari halo car always does, but was it the gravitational center of the event? People will wax on, telling you its not like the F40. “THAT was an instant icon” people usually opine. “Every kid with a bedroom wall had that poster! Something is missing.” Nostalgia is murky, and the truth is a little more nuanced. Upon its release in 1987, the Ferrari F40 received a mix of acclaim and criticism. It performed, but it was brutish, especially compared to its competition. It wasn’t yet on a pedestal. It had to earn it. And it would. Eventually. But it took decades to become the untouchable legend it is today. Whether the F80, or any other modern hypercar for that matter can achieve such heights is uncertain.    The Cavallino Classic is a crossroads, connecting Ferrari’s past, the stuff of legend, to whatever comes next. The show definitely captures Ferrari, and it's culture at a crucial point in time. Some of these cars will matter forever, some might never make it to the kind of legendary status we're used to seeing for some models. Right now, it is tough to know what’s to come, but at least we know the heritage is safe in the hands of everyone that came out to celebrate the legend that is Ferrari at Cavallino.
