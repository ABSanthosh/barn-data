    "description": "This Ferrari 250 GT re-creation depicts a Spyder reimagining of the Berlinetta Speciale that was custom-built in 1957 by Pinin Farina for Prince Bernhard van Lippe-Biesterfeld of the Netherlands. This car, chassis 13153, was initially built as a 365 GT 2+2 in 1969 and received a mechanical refurbishment around 2000 that involved an overhaul of the 4.4-liter Colombo V12. The car was sourced in 2010 by David Rose, former owner of Ferrari of San Diego, as the basis for the project. It was transported to Coachsmithing Auto Design of Blair, Wisconsin, where it was stripped and fitted with hand-formed aluminum bodywork finished in red along with a removable color-matched hardtop. Following Mr. Rose's passing, the completion of the build was overseen by his brother and concluded in 2024. Shifting is via a five-speed manual transmission, and the car is further equipped with triple Weber carburetors, 15\" Borrani wire wheels, ventilated disc brakes, and a quad-exit exhaust system. Inside, the refreshed cabin houses seating for two trimmed in tan leather as well as a wood-rimmed steering wheel, power windows, and Veglia instrumentation. Work performed in preparation for the sale involved servicing the rear air shocks, performing electrical work, repairing leaks at the brake master cylinder and power steering pump, and replacing the clutch cable and spark plugs. This 250 GT Speciale re-creation is now offered on dealer consignment in California with an owner's manual, service records, spare components, and a Massachusetts title listing the car as a 1970 Ferrari 365 GT 2+2 Coupe.",

    "description": "This 1957 Jaguar XK140 roadster was refurbished in 1977 and was acquired out of Richland, Washington, by the seller's father in 1982. The car was kept in Idaho for years, and the seller inherited the vehicle in the early 2000s and relocated it to Arizona before returning it to Washington in 2006. The replacement 3.4-liter inline-six is paired with a four-speed manual transmission. Finished in gray over blue leather, the car features a black soft top, 16\" wire wheels, dual SU carburetors, a Nardi steering wheel, and adjustable seats. This XK140 OTS is now offered with records dating back to 1977, an owner's manual, an electric-fan kit, a car cover, and a clean Washington title in the seller's name that lists the model year as 1957.",

    "description": "Cameras caught 98% of speeding offences in 2023 A total of 2,324,542 speed-limit breaches were recorded in England and Wales last year The number of speeding offences recorded by police forces across England and Wales last year hit an all-time high, according to new data released by the Home Office. A total of 2,324,542 speed-limit breaches were recorded during 2023 – an increase of 10% compared with the year prior and the highest since comparable records began in 2011. Of these, 98% were caught by a camera. The Home Office said that speeding increased at a greater rate than the number of cars on the road between 2011 and 2023. It added that speeding varied seasonally, with the offence becoming more frequent during the summer months. It peaked in June 2023, at 223,029 cases, compared with 159,179 breaches during December. The data published by the Home Office excludes London, because the Metropolitan Police force responsible for the capital uses a different computer system to log offences. The Met recorded 390,403 instances of speeding in 2023, an increase of 3% compared with the year prior, and nearly triple that recorded before the Covid pandemic. The Home Office named the reduction of speed limits across London as one of several causes of the significant increase in offences since the pandemic, although it neglected to explain any others. Speeding accounted for 86% of the 2,698,373 motoring offences that resulted in a fixed penalty notice being issued across England and Wales in 2023. More than half (51%) those offences resulted in driver retraining – a speed awareness course, for example – and 36% resulted in fines being paid. The remaining 13% ended in court action. “Drivers need to know that forces are applying the law and bad behaviour will be caught either in person or on camera,” said Jack Cousens, head of roads policy for the AA. However, he added: “While cameras and new technology have an important role to play in road safety, these stats clearly show that we need more cops in cars to police the roads.”",

    "description": "Mk3 model gains digital tech, ADAS, slicker looks... Is this mission creep? Long before the Dacia Duster arrived on the scene, it was Steve Norman, at the time the Renault Group’s global marketing chief, who in 2010 told this magazine that Dacia “makes new cars for people who didn’t think they could afford one”.Norman’s justifiable comments were made not too long after the Romanian brand became the first company to launch a €5000 model in Europe (the Logan saloon, in 2004) and the car world has since become an awful lot more expensive, but the Brit’s precis of Dacia’s role still applies. It’s why the new, Mk3 Duster – a sharply styled, spacious and comfortable crossover – today starts at about £18,000 and tops out at little over £26,000 even if you have the more powerful version in the most generous specification. Outwardly, it is exceptional value, as were its two likeable forebears.No wonder, then, that the Duster has been such a wild success. Dacia has sold 2.2 million of them at an accelerating rate since 2010 and currently makes 1000 per day, with UK cars built at the Pitesti plant in Romania. (The Mk1 was made only at the Avtoframos plant in Moscow.)In 2022, even though the Mk2 was reaching the end of its life and couldn’t offer hybrid power, it became Europe’s top-selling SUV among private buyers – and Dacia aims to do even better with the Mk3, which has undergone something of a styling glow-up inside and out.But despite the Duster’s slick new cabin mouldings and the adoption of ADAS, its drawcard remains the same. The car is about simplicity, practicality and everyday toughness – attributes that have made it almost uniquely fit for purpose, if also a touch rough and ready in the case of older versions. Rolling refinement and a charming cabin were the missing pieces in the Duster puzzle, and understandably so, because beneath a certain price, you simply can’t have everything.At the same time, the outgoing Duster was a bit of a breakthrough in this respect, just tipping over the threshold from ‘feels cheap, but at least it is cheap’ to being a genuinely good car at an unbeatable price. It was a car that felt on the cusp of making considerably more expensive and outwardly lavish alternatives look a bit silly at times.The questions now is whether the new Duster can finish the job, meaningfully surpassing the Mk2. Not to spoil the surprise, but the short answer is that, yes, the new car is better almost everywhere.",

    "link": "https://www.bikeexif.com/1996-yamaha-trx850",
    "description": "Back in the 90s, Yamaha broke from their tradition of building Deltabox-framed sportbikes to create the TRX850. Sporting a trellis frame and the parallel-twin mill from the TDM850, the Yamaha TRX850 was made to entice sportbike riders away from the Ducati 900SS. So its design was an oddball, yet charming, mash-up of East and West—and although it wasn’t a huge seller, it was, by all accounts, a very capable machine. London-based fabricator Seb Hipperson has been wringing the neck of this 1996-model Yamaha TRX850 for fifteen years, and has finally given it a long overdue makeover. Seb mostly works on furniture, but he’s also a motorcycle enthusiast and racer—so he makes time to wrench on bikes whenever he can. It was the TRX850’s trellis frame that originally attracted Seb to it—that, and the fact that it was something of an obscure donor bike for a build, compared to the more popular Ducati SuperSport.…",

    "description": "The early 1970s were trying times at Harley-Davidson. The effects of AMF’s takeover in 1969 were trashing the company’s reputation and finances, and the flood of incoming Japanese standards provided reliable low-cost alternatives. To make matters worse, Harley’s grip on dirt track racing was in jeopardy after Brits had twisted the AMA’s arm for a single allowable displacement, no matter the valve configuration. With the backbone of Harley’s racing department threatened, it was a mad dash to regain AMA supremacy from Triumph and BSA, resulting in the all-conquering XR750 and a lesser-known pavement star called the XRTT. With scant resources to operate on, Harley’s initial effort at an OHV 750 was based on the 900 ci Iron-Head Sportster, with the engine de-stroked dramatically to fall with the allowable displacement.…",

    "description": "Someone wise recently told me: “A watch tells more than time.” Essentially, this means your watch is an extension of yourself, and different watches fit different people's personas. That saying is actually quite fitting for this bike – the gorgeous Royal Enfield Goan Classic 350. It isn't too different from the Classic 350, but it's targeted at a rather different rider – someone who wants to be unique but doesn't want the compromises that come with this style of bike. RE Goan Classic 350: Design, changes to Classic Design is one of the foremost ways the Goan Classic differs from the standard Classic. Starting at the front, you've got these very retro-looking whitewall tyres, which are found only on a microscopic amount of bikes available on sale today. While the tyres have a retro look, a welcome surprise is that the Goan Classic runs cross-spoke laced wheels, which permit tubeless tyres. The tyres are CEAT’s new Zoom Classic rubber, developed specifically for the Goan Classic. While the front wheel is a 19-incher, like the bike it is based on, the rear wheel is a 16-incher in proper bobber fashion. Then, the Goan Classic trades the Classic's handlebar for tall ape-hanger bars that put your arms almost straight and in line with your shoulders. It also has more forward-set pegs from the Meteor 350, and together, these changes put you in a properly relaxed riding position. The Goan Classic is also the only RE 350 to get the metal switch cubes from the larger 650s. Even the exhaust muffler is new and has a bit of a raspy note to it. You also have a cantilevered rider's seat, which is just 750mm off the ground, making it the second-lowest seat on any Royal Enfield today, after the Super Meteor 650. But my favourite design element is this articulated rear fender that moves with the wheel. The logos and badging on this bike also align with the retro custom aesthetic and add that little bit of extra pizzazz to its design. The Goan Classic’s colour palette is very funky and out there, and those who like to make a statement with their bikes will like the paint options. There are four colours to choose from, but my favourite has to be the Trip Teal (nice naming, RE!). RE Goan Classic 350: Ride and handling, comfort So, how do all these changes affect the riding experience? The short answer is, not much. The Goan Classic feels very similar to the Classic 350, which is a very pleasant feeling, with the only difference being how you're seated. The tall ape hangers work rather well when you're riding, and there's no strain on your arms or shoulders. After a brief accustomization period, I found my rhythm, and I suspect it will be the same for most others. The only small caveat here is that while making a tight U-turn, you need to plan your movements correctly and be a little more mindful of the tall bars. And because of how you're seated on the bike, you'll also bear the brunt of bad roads a little more than the Classic. That said, the Goan Classic is nowhere as uncomfortable as its competitors from Classic Legends. Honestly, aside from the different riding positions, the rest of the riding experience is pretty much identical to the Classic 350. This means it's the same relaxed, comfortable, and smooth yet torquey bike we've come to know and loved over the years. RE Goan Classic: Verdict All in all, the Goan Classic 350 feels like a cut above the rest of the 350s in terms of fit and finish, quality, and uniqueness. This will also be reflected in its price, as it is the most expensive 350cc Royal Enfield. Prices start at Rs 2.35 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) and go up to Rs 2.38 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), making it Rs 5,000 - Rs 8,000 more expensive than the top Emerald Chrome Classic 350. With the Goan Classic, you're getting a very unique-looking thing with proven fundamentals, a custom bike straight from RE. So, if you're one of the few people who use their watch not just to tell the time but to make a statement, I think the Goan Classic will be right up your alley.

    "description": "First things first. The Audi A6 e-tron Sportback you see here is not an all-electric replacement for the ICE A6 we’re all familiar with. In fact, the two models have little in common. You see, under Audi’s new naming system, electric vehicles will have even numbers in the name with ‘e-tron’ as a suffix (Q4 e-tron, Q6 e-tron, Q8 e-tron) while ICE models will run odd numbers. The next-gen A6 will become the ‘A7’, the A4 has already given way to a new ‘A5’, and so on. This A6 e-tron is the second Audi model after the Q6 e-tron to be built on the PPE or Premium Platform Electric co-developed with Porsche. Advancements in the motors, battery and architecture promise enhanced efficiency, faster charging and superior performance. The A6 e-tron has been unveiled in Avant or estate form – that’s sadly not headed here – and this Sportback body style coming to India in 2025. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback design The A6 e-tron looks substantial because it is. It’s about the same size as the A6 petrol we are familiar with, but there’s more mass to the design, something most noticeable at the sides. A black applique low down on the doors, there to also indicate the position of the battery, helps break the bulk. The fastback tail gives the A6 e-tron Sportback its eye-catching shape and to me, it looks best from the rear three-quarter angle. There’s a lovely flow from roof to high-deck boot and the full-width lighting is really slick. A glowing rear logo is a first for an Audi and the digital OLED tail-lamps almost have a language of their own – eight selectable patterns and the ability to display warning graphics to communicate hazards to vehicles behind. With split headlamps, a semi-concealed grille, and a black ‘mask’ on the bumper to hide the air dams and ADAS hardware, frontal styling is a dramatic departure from the Audi template. The LED DRLs positioned up top get eight selectable patterns and this is a cool touch. A fact of note is that the A6 e-tron Sportback is the most aerodynamic Audi ever, and this bodes well for range. But, and this is just me, I’m not a fan of this newfangled organic styling. I like my Audis angular. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback interior and features Inside, you’ll see the latest from Audi and that’s a good thing. The basic layout is similar to what we’ve seen on the Q6 e-tron, which means it’s a cutting-edge interior and also a screen-rich one. There’s a curved display that comprises 11.9-inch digital dials and a 14.5-inch centre touchscreen, aside from which is an optional 10.9-inch passenger screen. And that’s not all. Versions with Virtual Mirrors (camera pods that replace the wing mirrors) also add screens near the A-pillars. And lest I forget, there’s also a head-up display with augmented reality! The latest-gen digital dials are a huge upgrade from Audi’s Virtual Cockpit instruments we’ve seen for nearly a decade. It’s got crisp graphics, nice colours, and plenty of info, though what’s missed is the option to go in-depth into EV stats. I did find myself relying more on the head-up display while driving, though. There’s superb detail and the augmented reality indications for ADAS and navigation that overlay warnings and symbols onto the driving environment are fantastic. Interior is premium and trio of screens give it a techy look. The centre touchscreen is, again, slick and responsive but the menus can feel intimidating at first glance. Shortcuts and widgets do help personalise the screen for ease of use, but packing in climate control settings on the screen is not ideal. The passenger screen is a good way to keep your front passenger entertained while you’re doing the hard work of driving a very nice and very soothing electric car. What’s nice is that the screen is not visible from the driver’s point of view on the go. Along with the closely related Q6 e-tron, the A6 e-tron marks a return to form for Audi in terms of quality. Everything you see and touch feels really high-end. The gloss look to the screens looks rich and goes well with the piano black on the centre console. Also really nicely done are the touch-sensitive controls on the steering that are better executed than what we’ve seen on the latest lot of Mercedes cars. There’s a capacitive touch panel on the door, too, for the lights. Augmented reality overlay on HUD is brilliant. Front seat comfort is good, helped in part by the option for ventilation, heating and massage. A leather-free interior is optional and I have to say the fabric upholstery on the seats and dashboard is tastefully done. Of the other elements, there’s ambient lighting that subtly adds some colour to the cabin and flashes warnings such as for safe exits. The A6 is also available with the option of a full-glass roof that can go from transparent to opaque at the touch of a button. There’s also the option of an 830-watt Bang \u0026 Olufsen sound system. Four of the 20 speakers are integrated into the front headrest for a more personalised sound right near your ears. Soft-close doors are part of the package, too. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback rear seat and luggage capacity The rear seat experience isn’t quite as nice as the one up front. Kneeroom is decent but not exceptional for what is a large car with a long wheelbase, and headroom is just adequate for tall passengers. The backrest recline could be more relaxed, too, but the biggest spoiler is the knees-up seating position which is a recurring complaint on electric cars that position their battery pack under the floor. Oddly enough, Audi mitigated the problem on the e-tron GT with clever ‘foot garages’ or cutouts in the battery. The A6 e-tron uses a fully flat battery pack. Kneeroom is good but knees-up seating position is a spoiler. Luggage capacity seems a lot larger than the 502 litres mentioned on the spec page. And should the need arise, you can fold down the rear seats to free up up to 1,330 litres of room. There’s no provision for a spare tyre, at least in this European-spec model. The tailgate is powered, and handily, Audi has added a light guide for the gesture control so you know precisely where to ‘kick’ to activate the opening or closing function. There’s a small 27-litre frunk, and uniquely, it can also be opened with a swipe on the bonnet. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback battery, motor and range On to the heart of the matter. The Audi A6 e-tron Sportback uses a lithium-ion battery pack with a nickel-manganese-cobalt chemistry. Battery options include 83kWh and 100kWh capacities. The larger of the two is available with rear motor as well as dual-motor, all-wheel-drive layouts. The version most likely headed to India is the Audi A6 e-tron Sportback Performance that uses a 100kWh battery that powers a single rear permanent magnet synchronous motor. Power is rated at 367hp with up to 380hp on call with launch control. Peak torque is 565Nm. The headline number for this version, however, is range – 756 kilometres on the WLTP cycle. What’s more, the 800V architecture allows DC charging at up to 270kW, which means a 10-80 percent charge in just 21 minutes. We are still some time away before 270KW chargers become commonplace in India, so the standard 11kW AC charging and optional 22kW AC charging capabilities are of greater relevance. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback performance and handling A drive around the breathtakingly gorgeous island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands gave an indication of what to expect. The Performance version might be the long-range variant of the A6 e-tron, well, range, but it’s no slow coach. 0-100kph takes 5.4 seconds and the top speed is capped at 210kph. Of course, this being an EV, it’s fast, it’s responsive, and overtaking doesn’t require much thinking. But what’s different about the A6 is that it’s not one of those EVs that slams you back onto your seat. Its build of power is nice and gradual and the general feeling is of an easygoing and chilled-out car that wants to do luxury better than all other things. The general feeling is of an easy-going and chilled-out car that wants to do luxury well. You feel as much when toggling between the drive modes, too. There are Comfort, Efficiency, Dynamic and Balanced modes, and each impacts the throttle responses, steering and damping. Even in the sportiest of the driving modes, the A6 still feels very relaxed and gentle around the curves. Sure, there is nicer weight around the steering and the suspension does firm up, but if you want an agile sporty car, you should probably be looking at the RS e-tron GT in Audi’s line-up. Don’t get me wrong, because the A6 drives with confidence and is fun to drive when you’re in the mood. It’s just that it masks its speed eerily well. Refinement is spectacular and there’s only a bit of wind noise from the wing mirrors at speeds upwards of 100kph. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback ride comfort and braking Quick as the A6 is, it’s just as happy to slow down. The A6 e-tron packs in regen braking and you can control the levels of regen using the paddle shifters. There’s also a ‘B’ mode which brings in one-pedal driving. It feels very natural and was my go-to setting for the drive on the hills of Tenerife. The interesting thing is that Audi’s system marries the motor braking with the actual friction brakes, so they work together to give a stronger effect of regen braking. What’s really nice is that you can’t sense that handover from regen braking to friction braking or when they’re working together. The regen braking supplements the slippery shape, energy-dense battery and high-efficiency motor to deliver fantastic range. Refinement is spectacular and allows the A6 e-tron to mask high speeds eerily well. The A6 e-tron Sportback is really good on ride comfort, too. Steel springs are standard but higher-spec versions like our test car get air suspension. Unfortunately (or fortunately) there weren’t any India-spec potholes to test on our drive route in Tenerife. Even so, the 21-inch tyres dismissed any uneven surfaces with the air suspension doing a great job of keeping body movements in check. Ride height lowers by 20mm in efficiency mode for best aero but owners in India will probably use the lift mode more than any other suspension function. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback price and verdict The Audi A6 e-tron will follow the Q6 e-tron electric SUV and will likely launch in India in the second half of 2025. The A6 e-tron Sportback has an eye-catching shape and is high-tech inside, though it’s a vehicle to buy for the front seat experience rather than the one at the back. Refinement and range are highlights and even the middle-rung Performance version gets you all the power that you can really use. We expect prices to be in the region of Rs 1 crore, ex-showroom, which will be competitive for this size and class of electric car. The A6 e-tron Sportback represents the shape of things to come from Audi, and it sure does impress.

    "description": "At IBW 2024, KTM took the wraps off 2 India-bound models in the form of the 390 Adventure S and the 390 Enduro R. Technical specifications for both these bikes haven’t been revealed yet but we can make out a few things from here. 390 Adventure S gets cruise control, tubeless wheels Both bikes get adjustable suspension India launch for both is slated to happen in January Also See: KTM 390 Adventure S, 390 Enduro R image gallery KTM 390 Adventure S: what can be seen? The 390 Adventure S seen here is the middle variant in the range, sitting in between the top-spec R and the base X. Even so, it is very well-equipped. Three things that are particularly nice to see are the adjustable suspension units, cruise control and tubeless wire-spoked wheels.  The 390 Adventure S runs on a 21/17-inch wheel combination, shod with Apollo Tramplr dual-purpose tyres. Unlike the current 390 Adventure, the new 390 Adventure S uses an axially mounted front caliper and the brake disc has  We can also see that the 390 Adventure S is using the same 5-inch TFT display as the 390 Duke, although it is mounted a lot higher. It gets similar styling to the 390 Adventure R which was revealed at EICMA a couple months ago but the paint scheme is different here.  The launch of the new 390 Adventure models is slated to happen in January 2025, which is when we expect full details to trickle in.  KTM 390 Enduro R: most off-road capable 390 The 390 Enduro R is a focused off-roader based on KTM’s new 390 platform. It has very basic bodywork in keeping with its intended purpose. Like the Adventure S, the Enduro R also has a 21-inch front wheel but unlike that bike, it runs on an 18-inch rear. It is shod with Mitas block-pattern tyres, which are made by Reise in India. The Enduro R also gets adjustable suspension but the digital display is a very small one and even the switchgear is much more basic compared to the Adventure S. The Enduro R is also going to be launched alongside the 390 Adventure models in January.  Also See: KTM 390 Adventure S, 390 Enduro R walkaround video",

    "description": "To keep a car running, change its oil every 3000 miles,” says 76-year-old Richard. His advice is nothing new, especially for anybody who owns an old Volkswagen, and he has applied this saying to his 1983 Volkswagen Beetle, which has served him for over 20 years. Some 20 years ago, Richard got a call from a friend saying that there was a Beetle for sale not too far away from him. He decided to take a look, and the moment he saw the Bug, he instantly fell in love with it. Continue...",

    "description": "Photography by: Johnathan Rothman (@thejohnrothman) 1956 Jaguar XK140 Convertible Raced in period by Briggs Cunningham and Denise McLuggage Location: California, USA Country of original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: S818207 Mileage: 76,025 miles Colour: Red Original colour of delivery: Carmine Red Price: Call for Price The car As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer a unique collector-grade Jaguar. The Jaguar XK140 represented the epitome of front-mounted 6-cylinder Jaguars in the mid-1950s. This particular example is without a doubt the most storied one in the United States of America, as it was raced and campaigned by two of the most prolific personalities in the American racing world. The car was first campaigned by renowned Briss Cunningham, who was indisputably one of the most pivotal figures in postwar sports car racing, making a profound impact as a driver, team owner, and constructor. Briggs then proceeded to donate his XK140 to Denise McLuggage, an American auto racing driver, journalist, author and photographer. She pioneered gender equality in motorsports and journalism in the U.S., and was among the very first women taking part in professional automotive racing. Her racing achievements included winning the grand touring category at Sebring in a Ferrari 250 GT in 1961, and a class win in the Monte Carlo Rally in a Ford Falcon in 1964. She also participated in the Nürburgring 1000 km sports car race. This car's past is in fact so fascinating that it recently enabled it to earn a very coveted spot in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (MSHFA), where it resided in 2022 alongside other giants of the racing world. What's perhaps even more remarkable, is that the car presents in unaltered condition. It's been kept 'as-is' by its 4 owners (Briggs Cunningham, Denise McLuggage, and 2 other owners, including the present one), and is showing a splendid amount of patina. Everything about this car is original and has remained untouched over the last 58 years - the chassis, body panels, engine, transmission, suspension, wheels, seats, dashboard materials, and more, are all original. And, magically, 58 years later, it still elegantly runs and drives. Continue...",
