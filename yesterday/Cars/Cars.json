    "description": "I’ve been using the ViaTerra Grid 2 for the past two years and rate it as the best full-gauntlet sporty glove from an Indian manufacturer. The new Grid 3 builds on the same formula with a number of small tweaks and revisions. At a glance, it looks very familiar, but study the gloves more closely, and you’ll see that a number of the leather panels and various protectors around the gloves have changed. The finger and knuckle protectors are new, and so is the design of the leather pieces that hold them in place. The company has removed a number of accordion stretch panels from various places at the top of the glove, which has created a sleeker look. The protective scheme is mostly the same, but again, with some small revisions. Like before, the little finger is bridged to the ring finger, but the connection between the two now looks stronger. Now, there’s also a single patch of leather running down the entire outer side of the little finger; the old gloves had two stitched patches. Fewer stitches always mean more material strength. In fact, the fewer the perforations in the leather, the stronger it tends to be, which may explain why ViaTerra has moved to less closely packed ventilation holes in the leather. The weather is far too nice at the moment for me to tell you if this hampers the ventilation in any meaningful way, but so far, so good. What has been reduced slightly in size is the armour around the side of the wrist, though the coverage does not seem to be compromised. There’s a new reflective patch, and old conveniences like touchscreen-sensitive fingertips and a small silicon rain wiper on the left index finger remain. The grippy material on the palm is now larger, and, in general, I find that the fit is slightly more comfortable than the old Grid. ViaTerra claims CE L2-exceeding amounts of knuckle protection Like the Grid 2, these gloves are also quite stiff, particularly around the knuckle area, but they do seem to be an improvement. They certainly aren’t the most comfy gloves out there, but I’ve also spent plenty of full riding days in them without complaint. It’s the small price you have to pay for high levels of protection, something the Grid 3 has in spades. While it is CE Level 1-compliant, the company claims that it exceeds Level 2 requirements in areas like palm abrasion, knuckle-impact protection and wrist-closure strength. At 6,499, these are among the most expensive gloves in India, but they’re also among the best and are deserving of your money.

    "description": "We in the car-reviewing industry are no strangers to a bit of marketing fluff. Our eyes are now desensitised to it, trained to gloss over the flowery writing in every press release, honing in instead on the facts and figures. But there’s something about the way Rolls-Royce does it that’s so enchanting; you want to savour it instead, like letting a sip of wine swirl around your tongue before drinking it. The vocabulary is sophisticated but not overpowering, inviting rather than technical, drawing you discreetly into a life of luxury with every advancing word. I don’t know the exact cubic capacity of the engine, but for a change, I don’t care. Owners are ‘clients’, the best-seller is the ‘most-requested model’, an SUV is a ‘high-sided vehicle’, and acceleration is ‘progress’. Their used-car business is called ‘Provenance’ – it’s just incredible! The reason I bring up Rolls’ bewitching turn of phrase is because it reinforces the fact that it won’t let its standard drop, it won’t make a compromise, and it certainly won’t do entry-level. And as the veil comes off the Series II (Rolls speak for facelift) Ghost, the brand’s ‘more approachable’ saloon, it’s clear they haven’t done any of that. 2025 Rolls Royce Ghost design Did you know the core tenet of Rolls-Royce’s design philosophy is to begin with square, upright, straight lines at the front, and finish with smooth curves at the tail? I didn’t, but now I can’t look at any model from the marque’s 120-year history and not see it. In the Ghost, that begins with the unmistakable Pantheon grille up front, the Spirit of Ecstasy tipped forward proudly atop it. Sharp lines frame the rectangular headlamps and a bonnet that is purposefully long, falling vertically down the sides in flanks that enhance its 2.1-metre width and monolithic form. But then, as the window line approaches, the lines soften and dip, flowing into an almost triangular D-pillar and elegant tail. Unlike most facelifts that add styling elements, the Series II Ghost subtracts and simplifies. The front is a lot cleaner now, with slimmer, softer-edged headlamps and a single line of LED light signature. The complex, almost sporty air dam in the front bumper has been supplanted by a slim, single piece low down, though it must be said the Black Badge version you see here does have some passive aggression – beg your pardon, ‘assertion’ – in its air intakes. There are striking new 22-inch wheel designs across the range; a separate selection for the Black Badge that are more ‘open’ to better view the brake calipers. And at the rear, the LED tail-lamps feature the distinctive vertical strakes first introduced in the Spectre EV. Black Badge wheels designed to show off brakes.   2025 Rolls Royce Ghost interior, features The bigger news if you’re an actual Ghost client (See? It’s working) is that the customisation catalogue, called Bespoke, has expanded considerably to include options introduced in the Phantom Series II, Cullinan Series II and Spectre. These range from the subtle to the ostentatious to the downright bizarre. “We don’t like saying no,” explains Phil Fabre de la Grange, head of the Bespoke division, and he’s right. Why shouldn’t a Ghost client have access to the full catalogue? And this only furthers the idea that there’s no such thing as entry-level with Rolls-Royce. Unlike the parent company BMW, Rolls-Royce’s steering rims are as thin as possible. A big new addition is ‘Duality Twill’ – a complex and colourful stitching pattern meant to intertwine the R-R letters with nautical rope knots, which pairs nicely with the new sustainable bamboo-based rayon upholstery. It uses 11 miles of thread and takes 20 hours to create. There’s a new backlit Spirit of Ecstasy timepiece in the dashboard, and if you look closely at the famous ‘starlight headliner’, a shooting star will streak across at random every now and then. Sunroofs are so gauche. Another detail I love is the move from chrome-ringed fixed digital dials to a modern-looking full-digital instrument screen, which is customisable – once when you order the car. It’s crisp, clean and colour-coded to the interior or exterior of your car, and you can’t change it on the fly. Speaking of the interior, as with every Rolls, it doesn’t shout about its tech in the same way, say, a Maybach does. Buried deep under thick layers of hide, veneer, chrome and shagpile is the best the BMW Group has to offer; in fact, better, as it’s not as complicated as BMW’s i-Drive. Press a chrome button and a wooden table folds out of the front seatbacks, revealing a touchscreen that was until now hidden behind it. Each of the four doors is servo-assisted, and the motors shut softly at the push of a button. Even the beautifully analogue metal organ-stop toggles are connected to a fully digital auto climate control system inside the dash. Even SWB models have huge space and recline more than what’s pictured. No sun blinds, though. I could write a page about the Bespoke audio system alone, with its 18 speakers, 1,400 watts and zero branding. Its clarity and depth coming through those exquisite metal grilles knock the socks off any other high-end car audio you’ve heard, and again, it’s thanks to hidden solutions. It uses cavities in the car’s chassis as resonance chambers, incorporates exciters into the roof liner for greater sound depth, and has microphones that constantly read ambient noise and adjust the amplifier to suit. As for the throne itself, as the coach door swings open to reveal it, it doesn’t look like much at first. It’s fairly upright and doesn’t appear to have the typical luxury-car puffy bolstering or quilting. Slip inside, though – actually not so easy to do thanks to the rear-hinged door – and you’re immediately lulled half to sleep. They’re the type of cushions you just sink into and extend over to the sides, with an added pillow on the headrest. The seatback recline, at first, seems minimal, but that’s until you realise you have to push the seat base forward to unlock the full angle. As you do this, your head descends behind the C pillar, giving you the sort of privacy reserved for royalty. Unbranded ‘bespoke’ audio sounds incredible. Legroom? Even with the standard 3,295mm wheelbase, it’s immense, but there’s also an Extended version with a 3,465mm wheelbase. Seat heating, cooling and massage are options, but interestingly, rear window blinds aren’t. Rolls says most clients are content with tinted rear windows, but of course, these are illegal in India. However, in the spirit of never saying no, they’re working on it. 2025 Rolls Royce Ghost performance, engine Alarmingly, to these ears at least, Rolls says that since the Cullinan SUV came along in 2018, the number of chauffeur-driven clients across the model range has dropped from a staggering 70 percent to just 11 percent. Should you, then, as a Ghost owner, want to commandeer your own motorcar, might I recommend the Black Badge, as it introduces a hint of spice to the experience, with no compromise whatsoever to comfort. Power from the six-and-three-quarter-litre twin-turbo V12 gets a bump from 571 to 600hp and torque from 850 to 900Nm, but Rolls is quick to point out that this isn’t some sort of Ghost RS; it’s merely a bit more expressive. This expression is best felt when you press the ‘Low’ button (Sport mode? That’s for plebeians) on the steering-mounted shifter stalk, which tells the 8-speed ZF gearbox to downshift more readily and upshift as late as is fashionable. I can’t, of course, tell you at what RPM any of this happens because there’s no tachometer in a Rolls, just a power reserve meter. Without Low mode, it feels identical to the standard Ghost in every respect. But there is a different kind of pleasure to be found in extending this large V12 (in this large car) as far as it will allow you. It isn’t high-revving, but it doesn’t feel overtly turbocharged either. Power is a swell, like a tidal wave gathering mass and momentum as it makes its way to shore, and I imagine there have been some learnings from the company’s aircraft engines here. At an undisclosed number of revs, it sounds good, too – heavy and mechanical. And interestingly, Rolls says customers want this, especially in the Black Badge. Digital dials customisable. At the time of purchase. Where the previous Ghost was based on the 7 Series, this new one shares no mechanicals with any BMW. It, like every other Rolls, is built on the brand’s aluminium spaceframe Architecture of Luxury, and with that comes clever suspension that has dampers…for its dampers. This, in congruence with self-levelling air springs and a ‘Flagbearer’ system that scans the road and primes the adaptive dampers, has allowed Rolls to fit these 22-inch wheels and sliver-thin tyres with little compromise to ride quality. At worst, you can hear the wide rubber as it hits a sharp bump, but you’ll seldom feel it. Apart from some minor geometry changes to the suspension, the Black Badge’s ‘disruptive nature’ is simply the work of software. It’s what allows the engine to be more ‘voluble’, the gearbox to shift earlier, the steering to be more reactive and the suspension to respond quicker. Agile, however, is a relative term, and by the physics-breaking standards of large grand tourers like a Continental GT or an AMG S63, it feels a little soft. The rear-wheel steering feels essential here, and the steering has some slack, but that being said, once you get it into a rhythm, twirling the thin-rimmed wheel and making all that mass move is, again, joyous in its own special way. 2025 Rolls Royce Ghost price, verdict Pre-configured ‘Inspired Specifications’ can be easily ordered, get special names like Idealist. With the Ghost having gotten so accomplished, what is the point of the flagship Phantom, you might ask? De la Grange likens it to what’s in your wardrobe: “The Phantom is a black-tie tuxedo with dress shoes; it’s for special occasions,” he says. “The Ghost is a business jacket and loafers; it’s something you might use every day.” It makes so much sense for something so far removed from my everyday life. Because in absolute terms, the Ghost is no less of a car. In fact, it’s a greater car than most others available. The lengths Rolls has gone to surpass just about any other luxury carmaker, and the results are plain to see in the level of quality, sophistication and craftsmanship, which few others can match. At Rs 8.95 crore, before options, you should certainly get your money’s worth. So even if you aren’t the type to self-drive your Ghost, or pick an outrageous specification like this, or opt for the Black Badge treatment, or even be swayed by the mesmerising poetry of the Rolls-Royce lexicon, know that you will be in possession of one of the finest luxury motorcars to have ever put rubber to tarmac.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/fiat-readies-all-new-500-2029-and-panda-2030",
    "description": "Long-running Panda – now known as the 'Pandina' inside Fiat – will be replaced in 2030 Stellantis Europe chief confirms 500 Ibrida also coming this November – earlier than previously announced Fiat plans to launch an all-new 500 in 2029 and an all-new Panda in 2030, in a commitment to producing city cars in Italy for the foreseeable future. “The plan for Fiat is very clear,” Jean-Philippe Imparato, COO for Europe at Fiat parent company Stellantis, told Autocar at the Brussels motor show. “The 500 will be completed by a hybrid version of [the electric] 500 in November 2025. Second, the next generation of 500 will come around 2029 at Mirafiori [factory in Turin]. “The Pandina [an internal nickname for the Panda] will be built in Pomigliano [factory in Naples]  until 2030, and then you will have a new Pandina at Pomigliano in 2030. “And you will have the Grande Panda coming in March 2025, both electric and hybrid versions of it. “So you will have new 500, new Pandina and Grande Panda in the line-up of the A- and B- segment for Fiat.” This means Fiat will continue to build the cars that have defined its brand since the original 'Topolino' 500 of 1936, resisting the temptation to abandon the city-car class for more profitable crossovers and SUVs that many of the 500 and Panda’s rivals have succumbed to in recent years. Citroën and Peugeot axed the C1 and 108 siblings in 2022 and 2021 respectively; Volkswagen, Seat and Skoda gradually killed off the Up, Mii and Citigo trio between 2020 and 2023; and the Ford Ka+ was pulled from sale in 2019. There are, however, green shoots sprouting: Kia, Hyundai and Toyota all continue to offer petrol-engined city cars (the Picanto, i10 and Aygo X) and Renault will launch a new electric Twingo next year. Chinese firm BYD is also expected to bring its Seagull EV to the UK. The 500 and Panda have been a linchpin for Fiat over the past decade. Indeed, the Panda remains one of the best-selling new cars in Italy, despite it having been launched 14 years ago. The 500 has been less successful of late, however. The big-selling petrol-engined 500, launched in 2007, was axed last year because of the introduction of stricter EU cybersecurity regulations and the electric 500e has yet to pick up the mantle. Such is the slow pace of 500e sales that production of the EV (and its Abarth 500e hot-hatch sibling) was paused last September and won't resume until later this month. This has prompted the development of the 500 Ibrida that Imparato confirmed will be introduced in November. This is a 500e retrofitted with a hybrid powertrain, the goal being reinvigorating sales to safeguard the Mirafiori plant. The 500e itself is due an upgrade over the next year, too.",

    "title": "New 2027 Dacia Sandero will be redesigned but remain a hatchback",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-2027-dacia-sandero-will-be-redesigned-remain-hatchback",
    "description": "The current Sandero was launched in 2020 and updated in 2022 Design boss David Durand confirms the car won't turn into a mini-SUV like the new Citroën C3 The next-generation Dacia Sandero will retain its conventional hatchback shape even as it gains an electric option and is restyled with influence from the chunky Duster and Bigster SUVs.  Due in 2027, the next-generation Sandero will be a heavy evolution of today’s car, remaining atop the Renault Group’s CMF-B architecture - which will allow it to retain combustion power while adding an electric option. Speaking to Autocar at the Brussels motor show, Dacia design boss David Durand acknowledged that while the brand’s design language is increasingly off-road-influenced in its chunkiness and utilitarianism, there are no plans for Dacia to become a pure-SUV brand, and it will not give the Sandero an overtly rugged makeover and a suspension lift for its second outing.  \"It's true that the outdoor and very strong formal language fits perfectly well, but nothing is forbidden, and I think something that's important for us and for the Sandero is not showing off too much. It's a very serious and well-made car, and it fits a lot of customers like that. \"It's not so easy to innovate on every body type, and the hatch is very well known by customers, and this is what they need: a car which has a lot of roominess, which is really part of the DNA of Dacia, and compact at the same time, because it's easy to park, easy to drive, not too heavy, not too high-consumption. So the hatch is the good solution. \"We also have to face CO2 emissions, so aerodynamics [are important], and we take all of that into account to continue to tick the box that this very essential and central car in our range is covering.\" Asked whether Dacia will turn the Sandero into a mini-SUV like the new Citroën C3, Durand said: \"No. Redesign, of course, but the body type is a hatch.\" He added that the higher-riding, off-road-flavoured Sandero Stepway is seen as almost an entirely separate model from the standard Sandero and it is important to maintain that distinction going into the next generation.  \"We have noticed that Sandero owners are not hesitating over the Stepway. They’re coming to buy a Sandero, and people coming for the Stepway are not considering Sandero at all. So we are talking to different people, and so we have to take everybody into account and understand that some people just need a good car, not showing off too much.\" Asked whether Dacia could consider differentiating the two model lines more overtly, he said: \"We could have a separated Stepway or more differentiation between them, but the fact that we are using a lot of common parts between the two cars and we are really using the same base is also part of the ingredients to make the costs low. We could say 'okay, we will make two different cars', but we will have to double the investment, and people at the end will pay it somewhere.\" Durand also suggested that the electric Sandero won't look substantially different to the petrol car, saying: “I think EV can be just a powertrain. It's not that because you are an EV that you need a special design.” He refused to be drawn on when the next Sandero will break cover but hinted at the possibility of a concept being shown before the final production design - but that's unlikely to be this year. Speaking more broadly about the evolution of Dacia design, Durand acknowledged that other brands are employing similar themes of utilitarianism and ruggedness as they seek to make cars more attractive but for less money but said he is confident that Dacia’s cars will remain distinct. “I'm not too worried,\" he said, “because this position that we built over a long time is not only about design and product; there’s also a big infrastructure behind it. It's using the assets of a group, and it's the story we built with our Romanian past, and so it's not so easy to copy.  \"There is also a company culture about designing to cost, how to make the design to cost, how can you reduce the number of parts and the way we discuss with our suppliers; all of this, it's not so easy to just say 'let's do it'.  “This is also something which is strong in our brand: it has a story, it's coming from somewhere. It's the result of a long process.\"",

    "description": "After a string of cheap ’70s bikes, I bought my first decent motorcycle—a nearly-new Honda 250 dual sport. I learned a lot of lessons on that bike, and the toughest one cost me some plastics, a little pride and a fat ding in my pickup truck box. That poor Honda ended up on its side plenty of times, but it’s no fun when the ignition’s off and the incident was 100% preventable. It’s far from the most exciting aspect of owning a bike, but sooner or later you’ll have to transport your motorcycle and there are plenty of ways to get it wrong. Whether by truck, trailer, van or hitch carrier, the basic tenants of safe passage are the same, and the investment in quality gear beats replacing parts.…",

    "description": "An old saying in aviation says ‘If it looks right, it flies right,’ summarizing the idea that the most ideal mechanical designs are often the most visually pleasing. While beauty is decidedly in the eye of the beholder, there’s no debating the Rickman brothers’ performance chops, and not a single item out-of-place on this exceptional 1974 Rickman Kawasaki CR900. In viewing Lot F171 of Mecum’s upcoming Las Vegas 2025 sale, the impact of the retina-searing safety yellow (or green?) paintwork is undeniable. It’s a bold color that feels like it’s just come back into fashion, but it’s correct for the bike and I’ll go out on my first limb of the new year by saying I fucking love it.…",

    "description": "[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgUU5nb1jAw[/embed] The attraction to automobiles does not always pertain entirely to a physical quality. Sure, a car’s design, or its smell, or its sound can be part of that attraction, but a bigger part lies within something more abstract. If there was ever anyone who could relate to such an emotion, it would be Rob Simon. His steed of choice has been, and always will be, the legendary BMW E30 M3. In the automotive space, the legendary Bavarian warrior needs no introduction or backstory. It has long been heralded as one of the most exceptional machines ever sculpted by mankind, offering a pure driving experience unmarred by unnecessary aids or features. Despite a near-death experience in his red E30 M3, Rob always lusted for another one. It wasn’t just the behind-the-wheel time he longed for but the deeper, unspoken connection it wove between him, his father, and his brother, all of which had E30 M30s of their own. That chance would thankfully arise once more, but not in the way he would expect. Tune in to the Petrolicious YouTube channel or the embedded video up top and relive Rob Simon’s BMW E30 M3 tale alongside us. Maybe bring some tissues along for the ride, too. Continue...",

    "description": "JSW MG Motor India will have one of the most sprawling pavilions at the upcoming Auto Expo 2025. We have already reported on MG’s plan to launch the new Cyberster electric sports car and showcase the M9 electric MPV. Now, the carmaker has confirmed two more models will be on display at the event – the MG 7 Trophy and the iML6 sedans. Let’s take a closer look at what to expect from each. MG Cyberster The Cyberster will be MG’s showstopper at the Auto Expo. It has been showcased in India previously, but this time, MG will announce prices for what will be their first sportscar in India. To be sold through the ‘Select’ premium channel, the Cyberster is based on a born-electric platform. It will be offered with a 77kWh battery pack, paired with two electric motors on each axle, simulating an AWD setup. This powertrain produces 510hp and 725Nm of peak torque, with a claimed 0-100kph sprint time of 3.2 seconds. MG claims a maximum range of 580km on a single charge (CLTC cycle). The open-top, two-door sportscar has classic proportions and a sleek new design language that’s reminiscent of MG's historic sporting heritage. MG M9 The newly christened M9, which is sold as the Mifa 9 abroad, will be second model to retail from the MG Select channel. It will make a reappearance in India as it has been previously showcased at the 2023 Auto Expo, but then MG didn’t have concrete plans of launching it here, and was only evaluating audience interest. The all-electric M9 has a front-wheel-drive setup. It is expected to be offered with a 90kWh battery which has a claimed WLTP range of 430km, while the front electric motor produces 245hp and 350Nm. The M9 is a large vehicle, stretching the tape at 5.2 metres in length, and is offered in both 7- and 8-seater layouts. The real highlight of the MPV is its second-row captain’s chairs with powered ottoman and massage function. The commercial launch is slated for March 2025, and it will likely be locally assembled, with prices ranging around Rs 65 lakh (ex-showroom). IM L6 sedan The L6 is an electric sedan from IM Motors. IM, which stands for ‘Intelligent Mobility’, was founded as an EV-only brand by MG’s parent brand SAIC in 2020, alongside e-commerce giant Alibaba and R\u0026D specialists Zhangjiang Hi-Tech. The L6 made its global debut at the 2024 Geneva Motor Show and is based on its iO Origin architecture. What’s unique about the L6 is that it uses a solid-state battery that significantly improves charging times and reduces leakage risks compared to a lithium-ion battery. In top-spec guise, the L6 uses a 133kWh battery which has a CLTC-certified range of 998km. Additionally, it can add 400km of range in just 12 minutes of charging. On the inside, the L6 gets a 26.3-inch panoramic screen setup, an additional vertical 10.5-inch screen, and even a yoke-like steering wheel. It also comes standard with ultra-long-range lidar, NVIDIA Orin X chip, and Qualcomm Snapdragon 8295 chip. MG 7 Trophy The M6 7 Trophy is a fastback sports sedan that’s based on the regular MG 7 sedan available in some markets overseas. It has a low-slung fastback silhouette with muscular rear shoulders and sharp character lines flowing down its body. Under the hood, the Trophy variant features a 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine that produces 257hp and 405Nm of torque, and it comes mated to a 9-speed automatic gearbox. In comparison, the regular MG 7 sedan uses a smaller 1.5-litre petrol engine. It is also luxuriously appointed on the inside with a twin-screen infotainment and digital instrument cluster setup. The interiors also exude a sporty feel with a dark colour scheme and sports seats. Apart from the said models, MG will also have its existing range of products like the Windsor and the Hector lineup on display at the Auto Expo 2025.
