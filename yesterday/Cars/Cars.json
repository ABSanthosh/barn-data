    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/government-invites-car-makers-help-reshape-zev-mandate",
    "description": "Transport secretary will work with automotive and charging firms en route to phasing out ICE cars by 2030 The government has invited vehicle manufacturers and EV charging companies to give their views on how to successfully phase out pure-combustion cars by 2030. New transport secretary Heidi Alexander has launched a consultation on the UK's transition to electric cars, in a bid to \"restore clarity for vehicle manufacturers and the charging industry so that they have the confidence to invest in the UK in the long-term and drive growth in the UK automotive industry\". It comes after business secretary Jonathan Reynolds acknowledged recently that the level of organic demand for electric cars is falling short of the targets imposed by the previous Conservative government's Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, and pledged to work with the automotive industry to find \"options for a better way forward\". Speaking to the automotive industry in November, Reynolds said: “We get the seriousness of the situation and we get the urgency,” he said, adding that a decision would be made by January.  “We know that you need certainty and that's why we will fast-track that consultation, giving you clarity on the direction of travel, and assuring you have the answers you need in the coming weeks before you make decisions in January.” Now, with January just a week away, the government is seeking feedback on how to update the framework of the ZEV mandate, which currently states that car makers must achieve an EV sales mix of 22% in 2024 – rising incrementally each year to 80% by 2030 – or face heavy fines for every non-electric car sold over the threshold. EV sales are forecast to achieve only an 18.5% market share this year, and many manufactures are selling a far smaller proportion of electric cars, raising doubts about the attainability of higher targets in the years to come. Already, some car firms are throttling back sales of ICE cars and selling their EVs at profit-busting discounts to get over the threhold. The government says there are already \"a range of flexibilities\" built into the ZEV mandate, referring to the ability for manufacturers to trade EV sales 'credits', and the Vehicle Emissions Trading (VETS) scheme which essentially imposes less stringent EV sales targets on car makers with lower overall fleet emissions. The consultation, though, will \"explore the design of the flexibilities to ensure they continue to support manufacturers\". It is not clear what modifications to this scheme could look like, but possibilities include allowing hybrid vehicles to partly count towards EV sales targets, factoring in light commercial vehicle sales as well as cars, and counting UK-built electric vehicles towards their respective manufacturer's goal. Importantly, the consultation will also seek to determine exactly what sort of hybrid cars can be sold after 2030, by which point pure-electric cars are currently scheduled to make up 80% of the market and pure-petrol and -diesel models are to be taken off sale. This latest move is also in line with a \"wider push to make it easier and cheaper for drivers to charge their electric cars\".  There are more than 72,000 public EV chargers in operation, says the government, with another 100,000 planned to be installed by local authorities using the Local EV Infrastructure (LEVI) fund.  In keeping with this objective, the government has committed to changing planning legislation to make it easier to install chargers. Installers will be able to use a street work permit, rather than licences, to \"make it easier and quicker\" to get the job done.  \"This consultation is focused on how, not if, we reach the 2030 target,\" said the government. \"It will give the sector the opportunity to consider how the current arrangements and flexibilities are working, which hybrid cars can be sold alongside zero emission models between 2030 and 2035, and any further support measures to help make the transition a success for industry and consumers.\" It added: \"Getting this transition right and supporting the growth of the electric vehicle market in the UK will enable Britain to tap into a multibillion-pound industry, create high paid jobs for decades to come and deliver on our plan for change by putting more money in the pockets of hardworking families.\" The government points to data which suggests \"EVs are cheaper to own and drive than ever, and can run from as little as 2p per mile\", adding that charging an EV at home could save up to £750 per year compared to an ICE car. It also said \"upfront costs are coming down, with one in three used electric cars now costing under £20,000 to buy\".",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/dacia-ferrari-testers-trade-cars-ultimate-secret-santa",
    "description": "Forget the roast turkey, the carefully curated motors are the real main course Our Secret Santa lunch is a chance for Autocar’s road testers to show their caring, sharing side Secret Santa. A nice idea, often poorly executed. Usually it’s done as a money saving measure, and usually it’s within an office environment and you end up buying for someone you don’t know particularly well. But this Christmas we’ve turned the tables. We’ve given our crack team of road testers unlimited funds with which they can ‘buy’ someone else their dream car. The results? While of course there’s one supercar, a cheap EV, a resto-mod and a commercial vehicle all make the list too… Mark Tisshaw Who likes someone enough to get them that Ferrari out there in the car park? That’s the one we all really want… Matt Prior It’s Christmas. If you’re going to buy somebody something for Christmas, money no object, why not buy them a Ferrari? And it’s festively red. The coupé, however, isn’t a new car, but the Spider is, and I think I’m right in saying it’s replacing the coupé to become the only Roma. Given that (a) it’s such a good car in coupé form and (b) Richard likes it so much, I thought it was the perfect car for him. Is it not the best Christmas present? Like, ever? Steve Cropley Is that the first time you’ve been given a Ferrari, mate? Richard Lane Sadly, yes… But what a superb gift it is. Truly, I feel there’s a case to be made that the Roma is not only the most complete car Ferrari makes but also, possibly, the best. It has had a bit of a chassis nip and tuck going from coupé to Spider – the bite point for the brakes isn’t so ridiculously sensitive and the steering is a touch more measured. It’s just a bit more natural to drive overall, and remember the coupé being already incredibly intuitive. Underrated, too. It lives in the shadow of the 812, but only in the minds of those who haven’t driven both cars: it does things the V12 car doesn’t. Or, at least, doesn’t do easily, at sane speeds. On the road just now there was a sweeping corner where you change down to third, turn in, then squeeze the throttle an almost imperceptible amount and the nose just tightens. I mean, an Aston Vantage is just so far from that level of deftness and precision. And it’s such a pretty thing. Ferrari Roma From Matt Prior to Richard Lane Price £210,848 Price as tested £323,799 Power 612bhp MT So why say it’s underrated? We all love it. RL No one really talks about them. It’s not spectacular, it doesn’t really get headlines. And I think to understand the genius of the Roma, you really need to spend time in one and, not to put too fine a point on it, know how to drive smoothly and with precision. When you’re flowing it along at seven-and-a-half-, eight-tenths, gearing up most of the time, and you listen very, very carefully to what the chassis is doing… It’s completely brilliant. Era-defining. Matt Saunders Perhaps it’s got Porsche Cayman-itis, or, like the Ferrari 360 Modena, there’s a precedent for people overlooking junior cars from brands like that. SC I think that’s it. It’s a format of vehicle that doesn’t make it the most radical Ferrari, therefore you perhaps don’t move it to the top of the class. I think a Spider in particular looks terrific. I love the profile. Beautiful. RL It’s a format Ferrari should try to keep alive in some way or another: a compactly proportioned, beautifully balanced, everyday, usable, sporting Ferrari. MT Speaking of keeping things alive… Who brought that MG and what is it? RL I did: it’s an MGB from a company called Frontline, and I collected it only this morning in Abingdon, just around the corner from here, for Mr Matthew Saunders. Bear with me here, but I think that car embodies what our road test editor is all about: it’s got a rich vein of laid-back, leather and metal tradition running through it, and yet it is a sporting car that wants to be driven hard and attack a good road. Think of it as the man’s Patronus. Frontline MGB From Richard Lane to Matt Saunders Price £140,000 (est) Price as tested £140,000 (est) Power 290bhp MS And I haven’t had a go yet. The last Frontline MG I drove was the electric one, but obviously that was missing an engine. How big a part of the experience is the engine in this one? RL Huge. The engine is an utter cracker: a 2.5-litre Ford Duratec but completely overhauled. It now makes 290bhp and spins out forever. The rest of the car is gloriously analogue, too; it hasn’t even got ABS. You need to really think about driving it and what you’re doing. Equally, it’s not at all recalcitrant. The ’box is from an MX-5, and there’s variable power steering so it’s easy to manhandle in car parks. It’s a perfect blend of usability and rawness. Genuinely comfy, too. SC They haven’t done anything to the shape, have they? The wheels are nice, too. RL On the faithfulness, one of the reasons they’ve kept that live axle at the back is so it is absolutely authentically an MGB. It would have been quite easy to change the pick-up points, rip everything out and engineer something new. But they haven’t. It does handle and it does ride, and these roads around here are about as tough as it gets for road testing.  MS I do wonder where it sits. They didn’t set out to make the electromod, but there was so much bloody demand for it, they had to. People were asking for it all the time. But I’d like to think plenty of others will still want a four-cylinder MG with 290bhp at all those revs. MT Who brought the Jimny? SC I did, and it’s for Mr Prior. The thing that did it for me was looking in the back of the commercial version, which is all you can buy. It seemed to be about the size of a hay bale, and he’s always on about moving animal feed from here to there. We’ve had the odd conversation about Jimnys being good cars, and how light 4x4s are better than heavy 4x4s. MP It’s just what I always wanted; I’m close to tears. It will do everything the Defender I have now does apart from towing, but that’s okay because I barely use it for towing any more anyway. It has no seats in the back, but that’s okay because the children left, so we don’t need seats in the back. It has a bulkhead between the cargo bay and the cabin, so you don’t get the front full of hay, and that’s another advantage. It’s small enough that the Alliance Against Urban 4x4s isn’t going to come round and let the tyres down. It’s spot on, and it’s not going to present me with a four-grand service and repair bill, like my Defender is about to. Illya Verpraet What more could you want? And you’re not too tall to fit in it. MS Is there less room in the front of it in the commercial versions? IV They have to put the bulkhead in a certain place to classify it as a commercial vehicle. MT Is this a bit of a road testers’ car, a car we enthusiasts like but which hasn’t really caught fire commercially? Suzuki Jimny Commerical From Steve Cropley to Matt Prior Price £22,299 Price as tested £22,299 Power 100bhp IV I think it has caught fire. They just couldn’t sell that many because of CO2 regulation and one or two other things. They could have sold many more than they were allowed to. SC They’re much more successful in far-flung markets, such as India and places like that, and I don’t think Suzuki can really be bothered with investing in a European specification. It’s a case of grabbing one while you can. RL About it being a road testers’ car… It’s actually kind of the opposite. It’s a car we all love, but because the road test has to be an objective assessment, the Jimny ends up getting only three and a half stars: the steering isn’t there, the body control isn’t there, it’s not that innovative, it’s quite expensive. It’s a four-and-a-half-star car in our hearts, but we can’t justify awarding it that score in a road test. MT Staying with small cars: the Dacia Spring. RL The one with five miles of range left after a morning of light driving? MS I brought it, and it’s for Illya. He’s been very gracious about it. When you do Secret Santa, somebody always pipes up and says ‘10 quid max’. So I thought if you give somebody a useful, cheery, cost-effective present, they will always say ‘thank you’ because they don’t want to embarrass you or appear ungracious. SC But it looks all right. It’s not a toy. I can see it fitting into lots of people’s lives. Dacia Spring From Matt Saunders to Illya Verpraet Price £14,995 Price as tested £14,995 Power 44bhp Range 140 miles MS It’s not one of those pointless little toolkits you get in a cracker; it’s a useful thing, and it has a lot of value. If I had one, I’d get loads of use out of it. And what can you expect for a £15,000 car? SC A £15k electric car, as well. MS It’s very hard to get a £15k combustion-engined car at the moment, never mind an EV. RL Credit to Dacia. For that money, I think we would all rather buy something second-hand, but the fact that you can go out and buy a new EV for that, with a warranty… It’s great.  And it isn’t some sort of toy, like the Ami. IV You look at it, you see the Linglong Green Max tyres or whatever they are… But then you drive it. I do like Dacias, and they are always surprisingly good. It doesn’t feel like an expensive car, but it isn’t trying to be one: it’s decent, and you would get a lot of use out of it. RL I’m in the Duster at the moment, and it’s very good indeed. It just goes neatly into a corner, the steering picks up nicely, relative to the car’s positioning, that is. Is there any of that in there? IV It rides quite well for something with really cheap, basic suspension. It doesn’t clunk on these bumpy roads and it’s not thrown about left or right. In everything it does, it’s fine, and that’s the impressive thing about Dacia. I love the way they are: surprisingly cheap but more than decent. This Spring isn’t quite as complete as a Duster, but offering an electric car for so little money really is quite a result. SC The thing I love about Dacia is the way they make life hard for their rivals. Every time they launch another model, you can see the people who are trying to sell against them sort of going: “Oh sh*t.” MT That leaves just two cars. Who brought the Morgan Plus Four? IV I brought the Morgan for you, Mark. You’re our Car of the Year juror and you deal in sensible, rational cars. But motoring isn’t all about sensible and rational, so I thought I’d bring you something very different. I love the Morgan, not because it’s the objective best car in the world, but because it feels special and it’s an event, and I often find that matters more than raw ability. SC It’s pretty fast, too, even the four-cylinder one. Part of the reason the Plus Six is disappearing is because the people who buy Morgans have discovered that 240bhp in a 1000kg car is actually quite enough. MT I’ve embraced it. I had the roof down earlier. I got incredibly cold, but it had a very effective heated seat. I like it; I get it. It made me think of Morgan’s hire car business, frankly. I think as an experience it works very well. The problem with nostalgia, though, is that it’s finite, and on my drive back here I was already fulfilled. Morgan Plus Four From Illya Verpraet to Mark Tisshaw Price £76,141 Price as tested £81,690 Power 255bhp SC You don’t strike me as a particularly nostalgic person… IV I don’t think it is nostalgic: I wasn’t alive when these came out. It’s just a great-looking car, it’s very modern underneath and if you have it with the manual ’box, it drives really well. You don’t have to worry about it like a classic car. It’s got the sort of styling and sense of driving sensation that you don’t get in modern cars any more. SC Morgan’s success has a lot to do with the kind of place people are at in their life. They tend to sell to the mature buyer, because they’re the ones with a few quid to spare. MP And it’s more chilled than a Caterham or an Ariel. You say to your other half: “Why don’t we drive it to the pub, or for a walk this afternoon?” They’ll jump in it in a way that they might not be quite so delighted to in an Atom. You could go to a wedding or to the theatre in a Morgan, but you wouldn’t really do that in a Caterham. MT Morgan is a hobby. That’s why my mind went straight to that hire car business. SC So true. If you arrive at Morgan in the late morning for a job, the hire fleet is all gone. Everybody is showing up at 9am with their missus or their kids, and they start arriving back at 4.15 in the afternoon. There are about 10 of them on the hire fleet, and they sell them after that, of course.  MP You can do that five times a year, spend £1000 and have as much fun as actually owning one, but with none of the hassle. And you might not drive it any more. MT That leaves us with the Kia. I’ve brought it off the back of a year spent driving four-metre-plus-long electric crossovers for Car of the Year judging: the EV3 stood out as the very best. It felt like a four-star car in every area, but it might end up having a higher star rating in a ‘more than the sum of its parts’ kind of way. My mind took me to the Volkswagen Golf, because the EV3 feels like a no-compromise car in the world of EVs in the same way the Golf does in the ICE arena. Steve would get the virtues of this car: it’s one in which you can get filthy and do 25,000 miles a year. It will ask nothing of you, but you can enjoy interacting with it at the same time. SC I like cars like that. We’ve had numerous good experiences with electric Kias, and this is the best one. I like the size particularly. I also like the practicality of it, the probable reliability and the range, and the price you’re talking about is pretty affordable. It’s one of those cars you would just live in: you would use it all the time. MT It’s not as big as it looks, and it in effect replaces the Niro EV while also undercutting it on price. I think that is a fantastic demonstration of the rapid progress we’re now seeing with electric cars and how they’re becoming more desirable and more usable, a bit more of everything, while coming down in price at the same time. The EV3 probably does that better than any other I’ve found. SC I like the fact that the car’s styling appears to anticipate the Chinese threat. It takes the car somewhere where other cars aren’t, and it anticipates the future. Kia and Hyundai are going to get a hard time from the Chinese, but they are already thinking about that and I admire them for it. Kia EV3 From Mark Tisshaw to Steve Cropley Price £32,995 Price as tested £39,495 Power 201bhp Range 367 miles MS It’s better value than a Jeep Avenger but comparable for appeal, desirability and style. MT It’s a class up from the Jeep Avenger, but it’s a no-contest: this beats it everywhere, even on price. I was on the launch of the Kia, and I went pretty hard on how good I thought the car was. Then it turns up on your driveway on a cold, wet November morning in dark grey and black and you start to have doubts: is it really going to be as good as I remember? But, yes, it is that good. SC It’s got a really good, satisfying interior, too. There’s a freshness about the design that I find really pleasing. It makes me feel optimistic about the future. IV Both Kia and Hyundai are very good at interiors, at keeping all of the stuff that’s good about traditional cars, such as control buttons and an easy kind of practicality, then clothing it in something that looks really modern and which has all the necessary functionality. MS Would you have one of these instead of a Renault Scenic? MT I think the Kia has a year on the Renault in terms of advancement and desirability. The Scenic was good everywhere, whereas the Kia is better again and more desirable. It’s progress. MS Before I pay the bill, how are we settling who drives away in what? MT I hope you’ll all agree I’m a nice, easy person to work with, but I’m using the phrase ‘pull rank’ for the first time ever and taking that Ferrari. You can sort out the other five between you. RL The MG: it’s so, so good. I could sit in it for a very long time. MP I’ve got a horrible feeling you’re going to say you want the Jimny, Matt, so I’ll take the Morgan. MS Yes, please. It seems the ideal car to enjoy for a bit and then teach my kids to drive in it. IV As much as I love the Morgan, this one is an automatic, so it’s a bit of a waste of time. I’d go MG, too, if it wasn’t already taken… SC I’d have the Kia. I think of the cars we have at home already, and the EV3 is one we would use. MT So nobody has the Dacia Spring… SC I’ve got time for that, too. IV A Dacia Spring and a Morgan: now there’s an ideal two-car garage.",

The Argentine duo of Marcelo Obarrio and Germán Karp works on myriad makes and models, constantly flitting between different build styles. So if you give them carte blanche on a project, you can bet they’ll deliver something highly imaginative—like a Royal Enfield bobber with a bespoke frame and a dazzling livery. The Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 [known as the INT650 in the USA] is a cracking donor bike for a custom build. It’s not crazy expensive, its parallel twin engine is easy to get along with, and it looks great out of the box with lots of room for tweaking. But for Marcelo and Germán, this particular project called for something more… “A client came to us asking to make a bobber out of his Interceptor 650, but it had to be different,” Marcelo tells us.…",

    "description": "The Ampere Nexus is currently the most premium offering by the brand and has been designed and developed in India. It exists in an extremely competitive space, where it is up against not only legacy OEMs but also established electric vehicle startups. The big question is: Does this new kid on the block have the credentials to hold its own against the rivals? Well, here’s what we discovered. The Nexus is a handsome-looking scooter finished in this shade of Zanskar Aqua. Not only is it bright and eye-catching but it also has a beautiful pearlescent finish under direct sunlight. Its design cues are subtle and tastefully done, and its overall build quality is decent. A deep cubby that’s usable, but the plastic surrounding it is quite sharp. There is a deep storage compartment located under the handlebar, but the shape is odd, and the plastics have a sharp edge, which feels built to a cost. The boot can swallow up most half-face helmets but will struggle with a full-face one, especially with its bulky charger inside. A deep cubby that’s usable, but the plastic surrounding it is quite sharp. In terms of features, the Nexus gets an LED headlight that performs very well and a bright and legible 7-inch TFT display. However, the display isn’t very smooth and, at times, had a delayed response to my touch inputs. The UI could be nicer, and it is also a little harder to use with gloves. 7-inch TFT is legible even under direct sunlight but needs a better UI. While the piano black switchgear looks premium, with its tightly packed buttons, it demands Blackberry levels of muscle memory to use.  Its tightly packed buttons demand muscle memory to use. The charging socket is located near the footboard and looks like a bit of an afterthought. Even the charger looks rather simple and not as well-designed as offerings from its rivals. Unplugging the charger involves pressing two release buttons simultaneously, which can get a little tedious. The charging socket doesn’t look as premium as the rest of the scooter. Despite its simplistic design, this charger is capable of juicing up the Nexus in around four hours. However, a bigger issue is the time it takes for the Nexus to boot up right after charging, which can sometimes take as much as five minutes in my experience. That is something that needs to improve. Overall, while this is a premium scooter, it could do with better attention to detail and finish. Ampere’s Nexus delivers a comfortable and nimble riding experience, making it well-suited for urban commuting. Darting through traffic was an easy affair, and the suspension made little work of any unexpected bumps. I’ve also received good feedback from those pillion riders. The suspension irons out most bumps with ease as long as the speeds are low. With a telescopic fork and twin rear shocks, the overall setup is well-controlled and leaves very little to complain about. Handling is good, and it is only on hard impacts at higher speeds where the scooter will generate an occasional hard thud. All in all, this scooter does a commendable job of striking a good balance between ride and handling. The Nexus features three riding modes: Eco, City and Power. The throttle response is smooth across all modes, ensuring a predictable ride without jerky acceleration. However, it is a bit too dull and reserved up to about 25kph even in City and Power modes. In my experience, these two modes struck a good balance, and I’d often oscillate between them on my commutes. On the other hand, Eco mode is very slow and is best reserved for extreme bumper-to-bumper traffic or to get home on a low battery. For reference, in Eco mode, the Nexus takes over 12 seconds to reach 40kph, whereas the TVS iQube takes a mere 4.63 seconds to do the same. In our tests, the Nexus performed adequately, with a 0-60kph time of 12.98 seconds in Power mode, which makes it one of the slower scooters in its segment. It features a 3kWh LFP battery and sports a peak motor output of 4kW. The Nexus has a certified range of 136km, but in our tests, we managed to extract just under 100km, which is around 10 percent lower than similarly priced rivals with similarly sized batteries. Zanskar Aqua is by far my favourite shade on the Nexus. In City and Power modes, you can expect a range of about 50km and 70km, respectively. Once the battery drops to 10 percent, the Nexus goes into limp mode, which severely limits performance. The Nexus’ braking performance is decent, and the combi braking system works well. However, the brakes require a firm pull and could do with better feedback. In our tests, the Nexus managed to come to a halt from 60kph in 22.04m. For reference, the popular TVS iQube managed to do the same in just 19.71m. The Nexus is a comfortable and endearing electric scooter, but it has areas that need improvement. Ampere’s Nexus is clearly the best-made and most premium offering by the brand yet, but it still has some catching up to do compared to its rivals. The Nexus’ LED headlight provides excellent illumination. The Nexus’ excellent ride quality, comfort and practicality work in its favour and give it a slight edge over its competitors. However, it still needs work on its overall finish and the end-user experience to meet what people have come to expect at this price point. If comfort is all you seek, then the Nexus could be the one for you, but buyers looking for a more polished experience will find other alternatives.

    "description": "Triumph’s Speed T4 stands as the most affordable product from the British manufacturer and undercuts the relatively affordable Speed 400. This iteration arrives just a year after introducing the Bajaj-Triumph 400 platform, owing to its origins as a development-stage variant. It does beg the question if one should consider the Speed T4 over the Speed 400, given that they’re separated by less than Rs 25,000. Surprisingly, I’ve come to prefer the Speed T4 in a lot of ways. While the overall silhouette remains the same, very little of the design has changed, and it would be hard to tell the two apart at a glance. The easiest giveaways are the graphics and front fork, which is now telescopic and not finished in gold.  Unique graphics for the T4, but could use more vibrant colours. Furthermore, the handlebar, headlamp mount, and footpeg holders aren’t made of aluminium; instead, they are made of steel. Triumph has also excluded the Speed’s adjustable levers and engine immobiliser. A legible speedo with an illegible, tedious-to-read rev counter. You do get the same semi-analogue speedo and switchgear, but you miss out on features like ride-by-wire and traction control. While overall quality levels are good, it lacks some of the higher-quality parts found on the Speed 400. Regardless, the Speed T4 is a handsome-looking motorcycle despite appearing slightly less premium in comparison.    The T4 offers an upright and comfortable riding posture, making it well-suited for city commutes. However, a noticeable increase in seat height due to different tyres may make it less accessible for riders under 5’8”. The seat is now narrower but still well-cushioned and supportive. Triumph has addressed this by narrowing the seat near the tank, aiding shorter riders in flat-footing the bike. However, it comes at the cost of comfort to some degree, and one will notice the lower levels of support on longer journeys.   To keep costs in check, Triumph has downgraded the T4’s suspension from a USD fork to a telescopic fork, along with cost-effective MRF bias-ply tyres. Given the more relaxed nature of the bike, neither come across as noticeably poor compromises. The tyres are good enough, and the suspension feels comfortable in most circumstances, although hard hits in bigger potholes do make the suspension feel a bit soft. The T4 is agile, but it’s not a bike you buy for aggressive riding. Heavier-set riders will benefit from adding some preload at the rear. Interestingly, Triumph says it has reworked the steering geometry and tuned the suspension to mimic the Speed 400’s ride dynamics. The T4 retains nimbleness despite a longer wheelbase, making it well-suited for relaxed urban riding. The overall setup is satisfactory for its intended audience. Taller tyres perform quite well but increase the overall seat height. Triumph has moved to an axial caliper and organic brake pads, which are more affordable but, in our test, can perform on par with the Speed 400’s braking performance. My issue is not with the braking performance, but instead with the lack of bite and feedback from these brakes.   At its heart, the Speed T4 retains the 398cc engine from the Speed 400 but with notable changes. Power has dropped from 40hp to 31hp, accompanied by a slight reduction in torque to 36Nm. Punchy motor has a wide torque band and is quite efficient. Key changes include a smaller throttle body, revised camshafts, a redesigned airbox, and a 31 percent increase in crank inertia. While this may sound disappointing on paper, the Speed T4 was less than 2 seconds slower in our tests than the Speed 400. More importantly, the in-gear acceleration figures were only milliseconds apart, owing to the wider spread of torque. The T4’s motor may not be as quick-revving as the Speed 400, but it impresses with its more relaxed, torque-rich riding experience. Bassy exhaust sounds great but could use a better-looking finish. It’s in the concrete jungle where the engine’s mellow nature shines. The wide torque band and smoother throttle allow for effortless manoeuvrability, with the sixth gear comfortably holding as low as 60kph. The overall experience feels smoother, the exhaust sounds bassy, and this comes a lot closer to what you’d come to expect from a modern classic. Fuel efficiency, too, has gone up, and in our test, the T4 managed to get about 38kpl on the highway and 32kpl in the city, which would put it on par with some of its rivals. By the end of my time with the T4, I found myself preferring its motor over the more expensive Speed 400.   The Speed T4 is a lovely machine that perfectly embodies the modern classic experience on a budget. It might lack some of the Speed 400’s premium features and outright performance, but it offers a more subdued, approachable and cost-effective alternative. Good looking headlamp that offers adequate levels of illumination. Its relaxed engine, refined throttle response, and urban-friendly demeanour make it a compelling choice, especially for those prioritising ease-of-use over raw performance. While the Speed 400 presents even better value, the Speed T4 is quite a different proposition, and its relaxed nature makes it quite an appealing alternative as well as a good rival to the likes of  Hero’s Mavrick 440 or even the Royal Enfield Classic 350.

    "description": "Right-sized premium. That’s how I’d describe the Audi Q3, and for me, this is a brilliant formula for a city like Mumbai. You want a car that’s manageable through the narrow and crowded streets but also something that isolates you from the chaos in a nice premium ambience, and that’s what the Q3 does well.  Despite the sloping roofline, the Q3 Sportback can take in large cargo easily. The dimensions are just right, placing it between the Creta and Hector; the steering is light and easy, and the ride is comfortable. Perfect, then, for chaotic city streets with surfaces in various states of (dis)repair. And then there’s the insides, which I really like a lot. Some will find the interior lacking flash and dazzle, but I really like these straightforward, sensible and quality interiors. This may be the baby of the Q range in India, but there’s no skimping on quality. The insides are very well made with high-quality bits, and the switches and controls operate with a nice heft. But what I really like about the insides is that everything is so logical, and that, surprisingly, is a hard thing to find these days.  The centre console is so logically designed. Oddly, that’s a rarity these days. There’s the option of traditional dials on the digital IP, and the design is clear and easily legible. And then there’s the centre console, which has everything so well laid out. I think I posted on Instagram some time ago about this being the perfect centre console. The touchscreen is neatly integrated into the dash and very easy to reach with a natural drop-down of your hand from the steering wheel. Below that is an HVAC button bank; physical controls are always welcome, and these fall easily to hand as well. And the dials operate with a click, which is easily felt and audible, too. The leather/leatherette combo has no perforation, and the seats aren’t ventilated. Below that is the media controller, placed closer to the passenger; the driver, after all, has steering controls. Below that is another button bank for the drive-mode selection – again, far better than touch controls – and the buttons are large and easy to hit while on the move. USB ports are easy to access and right next to the phone storage cubby, which is deep enough for larger phones and has a recess to keep the phone in place. So yes, oddly specific as this may seem, the Q3 centre console is really well-designed – not something you can take for granted these days.   HVAC knobs feel great and operate with a quality feeling and sounding click. The seats are comfortable and supportive, though I would have liked them to be cooled, and the material isn’t perforated either; so you can get sweaty on a hot day. The rear is a comfy place to be, but my son, who is now taller than me, does find the headroom tight; that’s the trade-off you make with the Sportback.  It misses out on a 360-degree camera, and the rear view camera isn’t very sharp. Speaking of the Sportback, I had to transport a large wheelchair recently, which, in our long-term Creta, pretty much filled the boot. While Audi says the internal volume of the Sportback and the SUV-body-style Q3 is identical at 530 litres, I thought the tapering roofline might pose a problem for the large box. But it fit very easily inside the boot. So, the boot does take in a lot, and this is with a space-saver spare below. I’ve got a trip to Goa coming up soon, and as I write this, I’m beginning to think that the Q3 would make a good car for it. The 190hp, 2.0-litre TFSI engine is a delight. Sure, handling isn’t sharp; it’s more neutral, but that’s fine. With my daughter quite prone to motion sickness, I hardly carve up the corners, and even if I do indulge in some spirited driving, I think the Q3 will have tidy body control and thus reduce the chances of motion sickness. If I do end up taking this to Goa, I will include it in the next report.

    "description": "The Honda Elevate CVT entered our long-term fleet at a time when a number of its segment rivals were already present. But while the others were in demand – the Hyundai Creta IVT for its easy-going nature, the Toyota Hyryder for its frugal strong-hybrid and the Skoda Kushaq 1.5 TSI for its performance – the Elevate was, in a way, overlooked. When the time came for me to hand over the keys to the Creta and take the Honda, I was intrigued to see what it had to offer. Having spent over a month with it, here’s what my experience has been like. Responsive and peppy 1.5 engine is fun in traffic, allowing you to close gaps quickly. Starting from the exterior, I’m a big fan of the way this SUV looks. The tall, squared-off stance, the imposing grille and the minimalist yet stylish rear end all look cohesive and give it a really good road presence. You jump in, and things get even better. The dashboard has a neat, uncluttered layout, and there aren’t too many textures and colours, which I like. The wood panel on the dash is tasteful, and so is the tan colour for the upholstery. The slick touchscreen has been glitch-free. The seats are also supremely comfy and support you in all the right places. However, I find the lumbar a bit excessive, and I would have liked the seats to have ventilation and power adjustment. My parents also appreciated the easy access to the rear seat and the space offered here. Overall, I really grew to appreciate the Elevate’s mature demeanour. And that goes for the way it drives, too. Bonnet flares help you place the car in tight spots. The ride is well-judged, as the Elevate just takes road imperfections in its stride and feels composed doing so. The engine, though a bit noisy, is eager to respond, which helps in darting through the gaps in traffic. This, coupled with the elevated seating and easy-to-twirl steering, means it’s a breeze in traffic. What’s also really useful are the flares on either end of the bonnet, which help you place the car. These are particularly useful, as it doesn’t have a front camera or parking sensors that should have been there. It lacks plenty of features, such as cooled seats, pano sunroof, 360-degree camera, etc.. Fuel efficiency has also been respectable, hovering around the 10-11kpl mark in the city. In our time with this SUV, the efficiency rarely dipped to single digits, which is impressive because it has no mild-hybrid assist or fuel-saving auto start/stop tech. What’s also nice is that the on-board computer is quite accurate with its economy readings. In my short time, I wasn’t able to stretch the Elevate’s legs on a highway, but drives on Mumbai’s eastern freeway and the new coastal road point to a good road trip companion, especially considering it also has a class-leading 480-litre boot. Despite no hybrid or auto start/stop tech, its efficiency remained around 10-11kpl. However, there are things that I haven’t gelled well with. The audio system is not good, especially since I’m moving from the Creta, which has a great-sounding Bose system. The other irritant is that you have to turn off the ADAS functions every time you start the car, unlike the Creta, in which it stays off. And I have to do that given Mumbai’s chaotic roads. It’s also only a camera-based system and not the more sophisticated radar-based system offered by rivals. Then there’s the feed from the cameras, which is low-res and choppy. Speaking of which, the blind-view camera’s feed appears on the touchscreen, so you lose the navigation feed for a few seconds when you’re about to make a turn. Moving from the Creta also highlights the paucity of features. Even in top-spec ZX form, it misses out on kit, such as a 360-degree camera, panoramic sunroof, electric handbrake, drive modes and more. Even the roof liner is woven and not the more premium, knitted type. Seat cushioning is very well-judged; it will take the pain out of a long journey. But while I did miss these features, the little things I did appreciate were the tactile switches for the AC controls, which don’t require me to take my eyes off the road, and the neat, well-executed and customisable part-digital instrument cluster. So, on the whole, it’s a car that’s got the fundamentals right, and it grows on you in a jack-of-all-trades way. And while it’s a frill-free SUV, it’s a fuss-free one, too.

    "description": "The Kia Syros made its global debut just last week, but we now have details confirming that the SUV’s all-electric version will come to India in the January to March 2026 quarter. When it arrives, the Kia Syros EV will take on the likes of the Tata Nexon EV and Mahindra’s XUV400. Kia Syros EV to be front-wheel-drive only Shares platform with Hyundai Inster EV While specific details about the Syros EV are scarce, we know that the upcoming all-electric compact SUV will be a front-wheel-drive model and that it shares its K1 platform with the Hyundai Inster EV, which is sold in international markets. The Hyundai is available with 42kWh and 49kWh Nickel Manganese Cobalt battery options, with WLTP-rated ranges of 300km and 355km, respectively.  Other than minor changes to its exterior in the form of highlights, badges and areo-optimised wheels and interior – EV-specific software for the displays and different trims and upholstery – the Syros EV is expected to look the same as its petrol and diesel counterparts. The features list and safety kit are also expected to be the same. Highlights include Level 2 ADAS, a 360-degree camera, a panoramic sunroof, two 12.3-inch displays for infotainment duties and instrumentation, a 5-inch touchscreen for the climate control system and the segment-first reclining, sliding and ventilated second-row seats. Expect prices for the Kia Syros to be in the range of Rs 15 lakh-20 lakh, ex-showroom. As we had reported earlier, Kia estimates that the Syros EV and the upcoming Carens EV are likely to bring in combined volumes of 50,000-60,000 units by 2026.

    "description": "Confirming its participation at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo in January 2025, Mercedes-Benz announced it will be showcasing five of its models and a concept car. The new lineup ranges from the electric G-Class to the Maybach EQS Night Series. Mercedes will also put on display already-on-sale AMG cars like the SL 55 and S 63 E Performance and the E 450 LWB AMG Line.  Electric G 580 features G-Turn, G-Steering and off-road crawl Standard Mercedes-Maybach EQS 680 is already on sale in India The electric CLA concept is based on the MMA base Mercedes-Benz G 580 with EQ Technology Ahead of its Bharat Mobility Show presentation, the Mercedes G 580 with EQ Technology will mark its India launch in production-spec on January 9, 2025. The new G-Class electric SUV will outperform its combustion-engined sibling – the G 450d – when driving off-road, claimed Mercedes. Its interior and exterior look unchanged from the regular G-Class save for some EV-specific changes.  The G 580 uses four electric motors, with one powering each wheel of the car. Each motor alone produces 147hp, making for a total output of 587hp, along with 1,165Nm of torque. Mercedes says the G 580 has a 0-100kph time of less than 5 seconds and a top speed of 180kph, however, it is aimed at delivering off-road performance. Its 116kWh battery, shared with the EQS, can be fast-charged at speeds of up to 200kW and gives a claimed range of 470km. Mercedes-Maybach EQS 680 Night Series While Mercedes-Maybach currently sells the regular EQS 680 in India, the Night Series design package will be offered for the first time. As part of the pack comes a blacked-out theme for exterior elements like the Maybach emblem, front grille panel, air intakes and running board. A rear roof spoiler is added as well. It will likely share its electric underpinnings with the standard 680 model, which includes dual electric motors generating 658hp and 950Nm of torque (combined), feeding power to all four wheels through the 4Matic AWD tech. This translates into a  0 to 100kph time of 4.4 seconds, before topping out at 210kph. The 122kWh battery pack, which can be charged from 10 to 80 percent in 31 minutes with a 200kW charger, returns a WLTP range of 611 kilometres on a single charge. Mercedes-Benz Concept CLA  Based on the Mercedes-Benz Modular Architecture (MMA), the electric CLA concept coupe first debuted at the International Motor Show 2023 in Germany. The next-generation CLA will continue to have four doors with the swooping roofline for a coupe-esque look. The grille has also been widened and merges with the bumper, and its headlamps get a new design. It is expected to get a full-width MBUX Superscreen, similar to the Vision EQXX's, with Mercedes’ new operating system. Further, it will boast the usage of eco-friendly materials for some cabin bits.  This new CLA will be slightly longer than its predecessor and could be the only entry-level offering from Benz in some markets, if it entirely phases out the A-Class sedan. We have also reported on the production version of the upcoming CLA coupe which you can check here.  Mercedes-Benz SL 55 AMG, S 63 E Performance AMG and E 450 LWB AMG Line From the house of AMG, cars like the 476hp-SL 55 4Matic+ Roadster and 802hp-S 63 E Performance will also be shown. Ex-showroom prices for the former and latter are Rs 2.44 crore and Rs 3.30 crore, respectively. The E 450 LWB 4Matic AMG Line entirely differs from the above-mentioned AMG pair as it only packs design elements for a sportier look. Mercedes currently sells the long-wheelbase E 450 for Rs 92.5 lakh. Also, see: Mercedes AMG S 63 E Performance review: Absolute Power Mercedes-AMG SL 55 review: Open air theatre",
