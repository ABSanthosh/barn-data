    "description": "This Rosso Siviglia 1987 Lamborghini Countach 5000 QV was first sold by Maurice Carter Lamborghini of Hamilton, Ontario, and remained with its original owner until it was purchased by the owner of a Canadian restoration shop in 2013. An ensuing refurbishment was completed in 2015, after which the car was imported to the US where it won a Best of Marque award at the 2015 Concorso Italiano. It was inspected and driven by former Lamborghini chief test driver Valentino Balboni in August 2022, and it sold on BaT the same month. Power comes from a rebuilt, fuel-injected 5.2L quad-cam V12 paired with a five-speed manual transmission, and features include servo-assisted ventilated disc brakes, an independent suspension with quad rear coilovers, staggered-width 15” OZ alloy wheels, a V-shaped rear wing, air conditioning, black leather upholstery, and an Alpine cassette player. It is now offered by the selling dealer in New York with factory books, tools, refurbishment photos and records, a framed photo of the car, driving gloves, a coffee table book containing photos of the car signed by Valentino Balboni, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Connecticut title.",

    "description": "The Ampere Nexus is currently the most premium offering by the brand and has been designed and developed in India. It exists in an extremely competitive space, where it is up against not only legacy OEMs but also established electric vehicle startups. The big question is: Does this new kid on the block have the credentials to hold its own against the rivals? Well, here’s what we discovered. The Nexus is a handsome-looking scooter finished in this shade of Zanskar Aqua. Not only is it bright and eye-catching but it also has a beautiful pearlescent finish under direct sunlight. Its design cues are subtle and tastefully done, and its overall build quality is decent. A deep cubby that’s usable, but the plastic surrounding it is quite sharp. There is a deep storage compartment located under the handlebar, but the shape is odd, and the plastics have a sharp edge, which feels built to a cost. The boot can swallow up most half-face helmets but will struggle with a full-face one, especially with its bulky charger inside. A deep cubby that’s usable, but the plastic surrounding it is quite sharp. In terms of features, the Nexus gets an LED headlight that performs very well and a bright and legible 7-inch TFT display. However, the display isn’t very smooth and, at times, had a delayed response to my touch inputs. The UI could be nicer, and it is also a little harder to use with gloves. 7-inch TFT is legible even under direct sunlight but needs a better UI. While the piano black switchgear looks premium, with its tightly packed buttons, it demands Blackberry levels of muscle memory to use.  Its tightly packed buttons demand muscle memory to use. The charging socket is located near the footboard and looks like a bit of an afterthought. Even the charger looks rather simple and not as well-designed as offerings from its rivals. Unplugging the charger involves pressing two release buttons simultaneously, which can get a little tedious. The charging socket doesn’t look as premium as the rest of the scooter. Despite its simplistic design, this charger is capable of juicing up the Nexus in around four hours. However, a bigger issue is the time it takes for the Nexus to boot up right after charging, which can sometimes take as much as five minutes in my experience. That is something that needs to improve. Overall, while this is a premium scooter, it could do with better attention to detail and finish. Ampere’s Nexus delivers a comfortable and nimble riding experience, making it well-suited for urban commuting. Darting through traffic was an easy affair, and the suspension made little work of any unexpected bumps. I’ve also received good feedback from those pillion riders. The suspension irons out most bumps with ease as long as the speeds are low. With a telescopic fork and twin rear shocks, the overall setup is well-controlled and leaves very little to complain about. Handling is good, and it is only on hard impacts at higher speeds where the scooter will generate an occasional hard thud. All in all, this scooter does a commendable job of striking a good balance between ride and handling. The Nexus features three riding modes: Eco, City and Power. The throttle response is smooth across all modes, ensuring a predictable ride without jerky acceleration. However, it is a bit too dull and reserved up to about 25kph even in City and Power modes. In my experience, these two modes struck a good balance, and I’d often oscillate between them on my commutes. On the other hand, Eco mode is very slow and is best reserved for extreme bumper-to-bumper traffic or to get home on a low battery. For reference, in Eco mode, the Nexus takes over 12 seconds to reach 40kph, whereas the TVS iQube takes a mere 4.63 seconds to do the same. In our tests, the Nexus performed adequately, with a 0-60kph time of 12.98 seconds in Power mode, which makes it one of the slower scooters in its segment. It features a 3kWh LFP battery and sports a peak motor output of 4kW. The Nexus has a certified range of 136km, but in our tests, we managed to extract just under 100km, which is around 10 percent lower than similarly priced rivals with similarly sized batteries. Zanskar Aqua is by far my favourite shade on the Nexus. In City and Power modes, you can expect a range of about 50km and 70km, respectively. Once the battery drops to 10 percent, the Nexus goes into limp mode, which severely limits performance. The Nexus’ braking performance is decent, and the combi braking system works well. However, the brakes require a firm pull and could do with better feedback. In our tests, the Nexus managed to come to a halt from 60kph in 22.04m. For reference, the popular TVS iQube managed to do the same in just 19.71m. The Nexus is a comfortable and endearing electric scooter, but it has areas that need improvement. Ampere’s Nexus is clearly the best-made and most premium offering by the brand yet, but it still has some catching up to do compared to its rivals. The Nexus’ LED headlight provides excellent illumination. The Nexus’ excellent ride quality, comfort and practicality work in its favour and give it a slight edge over its competitors. However, it still needs work on its overall finish and the end-user experience to meet what people have come to expect at this price point. If comfort is all you seek, then the Nexus could be the one for you, but buyers looking for a more polished experience will find other alternatives.

    "title": "Triumph Speed T4 road test, review",
    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-reviews/triumph-speed-t4-road-test-review-433878#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Bike+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "Triumph’s Speed T4 stands as the most affordable product from the British manufacturer and undercuts the relatively affordable Speed 400. This iteration arrives just a year after introducing the Bajaj-Triumph 400 platform, owing to its origins as a development-stage variant. It does beg the question if one should consider the Speed T4 over the Speed 400, given that they’re separated by less than Rs 25,000. Surprisingly, I’ve come to prefer the Speed T4 in a lot of ways. While the overall silhouette remains the same, very little of the design has changed, and it would be hard to tell the two apart at a glance. The easiest giveaways are the graphics and front fork, which is now telescopic and not finished in gold.  Unique graphics for the T4, but could use more vibrant colours. Furthermore, the handlebar, headlamp mount, and footpeg holders aren’t made of aluminium; instead, they are made of steel. Triumph has also excluded the Speed’s adjustable levers and engine immobiliser. A legible speedo with an illegible, tedious-to-read rev counter. You do get the same semi-analogue speedo and switchgear, but you miss out on features like ride-by-wire and traction control. While overall quality levels are good, it lacks some of the higher-quality parts found on the Speed 400. Regardless, the Speed T4 is a handsome-looking motorcycle despite appearing slightly less premium in comparison.    The T4 offers an upright and comfortable riding posture, making it well-suited for city commutes. However, a noticeable increase in seat height due to different tyres may make it less accessible for riders under 5’8”. The seat is now narrower but still well-cushioned and supportive. Triumph has addressed this by narrowing the seat near the tank, aiding shorter riders in flat-footing the bike. However, it comes at the cost of comfort to some degree, and one will notice the lower levels of support on longer journeys.   To keep costs in check, Triumph has downgraded the T4’s suspension from a USD fork to a telescopic fork, along with cost-effective MRF bias-ply tyres. Given the more relaxed nature of the bike, neither come across as noticeably poor compromises. The tyres are good enough, and the suspension feels comfortable in most circumstances, although hard hits in bigger potholes do make the suspension feel a bit soft. The T4 is agile, but it’s not a bike you buy for aggressive riding. Heavier-set riders will benefit from adding some preload at the rear. Interestingly, Triumph says it has reworked the steering geometry and tuned the suspension to mimic the Speed 400’s ride dynamics. The T4 retains nimbleness despite a longer wheelbase, making it well-suited for relaxed urban riding. The overall setup is satisfactory for its intended audience. Taller tyres perform quite well but increase the overall seat height. Triumph has moved to an axial caliper and organic brake pads, which are more affordable but, in our test, can perform on par with the Speed 400’s braking performance. My issue is not with the braking performance, but instead with the lack of bite and feedback from these brakes.   At its heart, the Speed T4 retains the 398cc engine from the Speed 400 but with notable changes. Power has dropped from 40hp to 31hp, accompanied by a slight reduction in torque to 36Nm. Punchy motor has a wide torque band and is quite efficient. Key changes include a smaller throttle body, revised camshafts, a redesigned airbox, and a 31 percent increase in crank inertia. While this may sound disappointing on paper, the Speed T4 was less than 2 seconds slower in our tests than the Speed 400. More importantly, the in-gear acceleration figures were only milliseconds apart, owing to the wider spread of torque. The T4’s motor may not be as quick-revving as the Speed 400, but it impresses with its more relaxed, torque-rich riding experience. Bassy exhaust sounds great but could use a better-looking finish. It’s in the concrete jungle where the engine’s mellow nature shines. The wide torque band and smoother throttle allow for effortless manoeuvrability, with the sixth gear comfortably holding as low as 60kph. The overall experience feels smoother, the exhaust sounds bassy, and this comes a lot closer to what you’d come to expect from a modern classic. Fuel efficiency, too, has gone up, and in our test, the T4 managed to get about 38kpl on the highway and 32kpl in the city, which would put it on par with some of its rivals. By the end of my time with the T4, I found myself preferring its motor over the more expensive Speed 400.   The Speed T4 is a lovely machine that perfectly embodies the modern classic experience on a budget. It might lack some of the Speed 400’s premium features and outright performance, but it offers a more subdued, approachable and cost-effective alternative. Good looking headlamp that offers adequate levels of illumination. Its relaxed engine, refined throttle response, and urban-friendly demeanour make it a compelling choice, especially for those prioritising ease-of-use over raw performance. While the Speed 400 presents even better value, the Speed T4 is quite a different proposition, and its relaxed nature makes it quite an appealing alternative as well as a good rival to the likes of  Hero’s Mavrick 440 or even the Royal Enfield Classic 350.

    "title": "Official: Honda and Nissan confirm merger plans",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/business-electric-vehicles/official-honda-and-nissan-confirm-merger-plans",
    "description": "The two Japanese firms are in talks to join forces in new holding company that could also include Mitsubishi Japanese giants Honda and Nissan have confirmed that they will begin talks to merge their companies into a new automotive powerhouse – that could also include Mitsubishi. Honda and Nissan have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to hold discussions over a ‘business integration’ of the two companies in a new joint holding company. They have also signed a separate MoU with Mitsubishi for that firm to explore that firm becoming part of the holding company. The plans were first reported by Nikkei last week. Talks will begin shortly, with the goal to reach a definitive agreement by June 2025, with the merger then going through in August 2026. If it happens the two brands would remain distinct, but behind the scenes they would standardise platforms and powertrains, share R\u0026D and collaborate on manufacturing.  Nissan and Honda are Japan’s second- and third-largest car manufacturers, and combined to sell nearly 7.5 million cars worldwide last year.  In March this year the two firms announced plans to form a strategic partnership to develop electric vehicles, and in August that agreement was expanding to become far more wide-ranging, including research into software-defined vehicles. The two firms have said the new agreement is intended to “maintain global competitiveness” and “deliver more attractive products”. Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida said the MoU agreement “marks a pivotal moment as we begin discussions on business integration that has the potential to shape our future.” He added: “By uniting the strengths of both companies, we can deliver unparalleled value to customers worldwide who appreciate our respective brands. Together, we can create a unique way for them to enjoy cars that neither company could achieve alone.” Analysis: Nissan-Honda merger would create new automotive powerhouse Honda CEO Toshihiro Mite added that “bringing together the resources including knowledge, talents and technologies that Honda and Nissan have been developing over the long years is essential to overcome challenging environmental shifts that the auto industry is facing.” Mibe said that the two firms have “distinctive strengths”, and that by merging they can become “the one and only leading company that creates new mobility value through chemical reaction that can only be driven through synthesis of the two teams.” How the merger would work Honda and Nissan’s plan is to form a new joint holding company that would serve as the parent company of both firms. That would be achieved through a joint share transfer, which will need to be approved by shareholders from both firms. The exact share transfer ratio will be determined by the final agreement. The new company would be listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, with the merger planned to go into place in August 2026. The firms have signed a separate MoU with Mitsubishi to explore that company joining the merger talks. Mitsubishi says that it will decide how it will proceed near the end of January 2025. Nissan and Honda will form a special committee that will look at how best to integrate. One key area the firm is looking at is standardising vehicle platforms of both companies across various segments, which would reduce production complexity and cost and increase economies of scale. The firm would also streamline their powertrain portfolio, although the new entity would continue to offer pure combustion, hybrid, plug-in hybrid and electric models. Another key area of the merger would be increasing their shared research and development, particularly in areas such as software-defined vehicles, which will be key to future growth. Honda and Nissan will also look to optimise their manufacturing plants and service facilities, and also to integrate their supply chain network and back-office operations. The deal would have significant effects on the wider car industry. Nissan has been in a long-time alliance with French company Renault, with both firms set to produce EVs on shared platforms in the coming years. In a statement, Renault Group said: \"As the main shareholder of Nissan, Renault Group will consider its options based on the interest of the Group and its stakeholder.\" Renault Group said it would continue to roll-out projects already launched within the Alliance.  This isn't the first time the two manufacturers have been linked to a merger: in 2020, the Financial Times reported that then Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe had pushed the two firms into talks due to concerns over the deteriorating relationship between Nissan and Renault at the time. However, both companies were said to have rejected the plans.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/ariel-christmas-miracle-extreme-winter-trek-new-nomad-2",
    "description": "Where we're going, we don't need roads A century ago, a Scottish explorer brought the first Christmas tree a remote Scottish island. We reprise her adventure with the help of an Ariel Nomad 2 Laid flat on the broad breast of the Atlantic, farther west than Mull, farther west than the Dutchman’s Cap, lies Tiree, the Treeless Island.” Those words open A Winter in Tiree, a short autobiographical story by Scottish explorer Isobel Wylie Hutchison published in 1924. Back then, Christmas Day was still decades from becoming a public holiday in Scotland, and on Tiree children would bury their noses in schoolbooks as on any other day. Hutchison, a visitor from Edinburgh with modern sensibilities, had other plans: “For the first time, Father Christmas visited Tiree. Perhaps the treelessness of the island had hitherto prevented him from landing, for the first thing we had to do when we heard of his proposed visit was to send post haste all the way to Mull for a Christmas Tree, and much anxiety prevailed lest the weather should prevent the boat from landing in time.” Bringing a tree to Tiree, which battles a month’s worth of gales each year, would have seemed as curious as posting an ice cube to Khartoum. But as we will discover, Hutchison wasn’t one for conventional wisdom. We’re honouring her festive evangelism by taking a Christmas tree to Tiree with the help of our own iconoclastic rugged adventurer, an Ariel Nomad 2. It’s the first development car for what is in effect an all-new Nomad that promises even more thrills than the genre-forging original, but this time with added usability. The insectile Nomad couldn’t look more incongruous on my suburban Edinburgh drive, so I install myself in its latticework abdomen, four-point-strapped to the solid composite seat, then start the fuel pump and spook every pet in the postcode by igniting the Ford Focus ST-derived 2.3-litre turbo four-pot. The stunted exhaust, constantly loud and bassy, is undertoned by a metallic churn from an engine that grows increasingly guttural as we pull away. It’s only five miles to our first stop, but that’s enough to sample the Nomad’s no-senses-spared modus operandi. I am already a little muddy and have befriended the drum-tight mechanical action of the close-ratio six-speed manual ’box, and I’m fully subscribed to watching the front wheels pivot almost within touching distance. We’re soon simmering down the drive of the grand, Scots baronial-style Carlowrie Castle, its formal shape still wearing patches of autumn’s crimson ivy. Now a luxury, exclusive-use events venue, Carlowrie was built in 1852 – and it was Hutchison’s life-long home.  Today’s custodians maintain a justified reverence for her here, including the annual ‘Isobel Award’ that celebrates unsung community heroes. Within the opulent building, we pore over books, photographs and artefacts plotting her extraordinary life and visit a turret illustrated with her story.  Duly humbled by Hutchison’s feats, we burble off as a wedding party arrives. Our next stint involves motorway miles, so I layer up with thermals, waterproofs, a heated gilet, ski jacket, gloves, hat and goggles. It’s a blustery morning on the M9 towards Stirling and I’m buffeted from both sides of the open cabin, but the windscreen means you don’t have to constantly brace into the breeze as on a motorcycle. I’m pleasantly reminded of the way a two-wheeler’s engine invigoratingly resonates through your bones, however, largely thanks to the Nomad’s surprisingly comfortable unpadded seat. It helps make you feel part of the machine, albeit my contribution to the structural rigidity is roughly that of a ham sandwich to a Nomad that is otherwise above 60% stiffer than before. There’s a bit of fidget from the 60-profile, 235mm-wide Yokohama all-terrain tyres via the unassisted steering, but it’s not intrusive, and while a rear-view mirror would only be filled by the periscope-like air intake that feeds both engine and intercooler, the generous side mirrors help. I’m warm, comfortable and content as we blare past the Wallace Monument: the car isn’t built for motorways but, in the dry at least, it’s a perfectly viable tool. We soon enter more natural surroundings for the Nomad on a short B-road stint, where the quick steering and newly even more generous suspension travel begin to chime, before squelching onto a muddy farm track. Here we meet Anna Black who, with her husband Ian, runs Caledonian Christmas Trees. Following Black’s pick-up along the rutted track, our double wishbones get a workout before my eyes – certainly no need for Land Rover-style wheel-view cameras as you watch the tyres grind across the surface. Speaking of which, the Ariel has similar ride height and breakover to a coil-sprung Defender 90 and trounces it for approach and departure angles, while its trifling 715kg kerb weight helps negate the need for four-wheel drive. In short, this stuff is meat and drink. We scatter a gaggle of pheasants turning through a gate and onto a 40-acre plantation: one of several sites over which the Blacks annually harvest 10,000 Christmas trees, mostly destined for garden centres across the country. Up close, the expanse of dark green cones differentiates into Nordmann Fir, Lodgepole Pine, Norway Spruce and Fraser Fir. Spruce was favoured by the Victorians, inventors of modern Christmas, and was Hutchison’s choice for Tiree, so we resolve to hunt out a handsome example. The Nomad tramps up one of the grassy lanes that divide the plantation, and the damp surface poses no traction issues. An incredible, sweet perfume of evergreens drenches the cockpit – yet another sense checked off by this relentlessly immersive machine. These trees benefit from year-round pruning, shaping and plucking to produce specimens worthy of your living room, and right by the track we find a beautifully symmetrical and bushy Norway Spruce of about 6ft in height. Black hands me the saw, and moments later the tree is installed in the Nomad’s passenger seat, needled branches bursting sideways and upwards in a spiky green explosion.  It’s a two-hour drive to Oban to catch the next morning’s ferry to Tiree, and a steady drizzle emerges to accompany the settling gloom. The smooth and often-glorious Langside road to Comrie is sodden, calling for steady progress through its auburn uplands: traction is strong at the driving wheels, barely bothering the switchable traction control’s middle of seven settings, but the Nomad’s light front end needs care to retain its line. The final 70 miles are on A-roads, and a deserted stretch alongside Loch Earn shows off the Nomad 2’s flow on quick, gently rolling sweepers. Our car features the essential £1800, three-mode ECU map but, in these conditions, even the standard 260bhp and 284lb ft setting delivers ample, boosty urge between bends. The steering is keen yet reassuringly linear, and the four-piston AP calipers and discs from the Atom 4 (also optional) scrub speed at will via a brake pedal that’s very easily modulated. At this weight, engine braking proves effective, too. Beyond Lix Toll, low, white clouds contrast with the black shadows of rivers and lochs beneath before the darkness becomes total. The heated screen and wipers do their best for visibility, and this car features a biblically bright light bar, but the colour TFT instrument display and backlit red ignition button are reflecting in my line of sight, while some key switchgear isn’t illuminated. These are foibles to be unearthed in a prototype such as this, but they make the final stretch more taxing than it might be and I’m glad of our 10pm arrival in Oban. Nine hours later, we’re rolling onto Caledonian MacBrayne’s spacious, 99-metre MV Clansman, our prickly passenger drawing mirth from crew and passengers alike. Installed in deck four’s cafe for a generous breakfast, I explain to photographer Max Edleston the principle of link versus Lorne sausage then step outside as day breaks over a flat-calm Sound of Mull. It’s moody, misty and chilly, with shafts of sunlight piercing the blanket of cloud. Mull is to our left and we cruise past the lush woodland of Aros, from which Hutchison’s conifer was sourced, and the cheerfully coloured front at Tobermory, from where it set sail on 23 December: “The beautiful waving spruce tree, twelve feet or more high, was an unusual spectacle amid the sacks of flour and wooden crates which are the mail-boat’s usual cargo.” We continue in comfort through open water and are escorted into Tiree by romping dolphins oblivious to the coming season’s festivities. On arrival, Hutchison’s description of the island still resonates: “The smooth green machair lands are surrounded by broad white beaches of wet sand, in whose shining surfaces the houses and clouds are reflected as if in a mirror.”  A briny bouquet slaps me in the face as we drive off the Clansman, with the tree’s needles whistling in the sea breeze. The rough tracks of a century ago, frequented by crofters’ carts filled with crops or fertile seaweed, have been sealed and enhanced with passing places but remain narrow and rippled. The national speed limit applies, but even on some straights it may as well be unrestricted, because 60mph feels like three figures. I’m surprised to hear, though, that islanders berate tourists not for driving too quickly but too slowly. There are £6900-worth of optional Öhlins TTX dampers and Eibach springs fitted, which Ariel says are for fast road and race use (there will also be an off-road-focused choice, with the standard set-up in between). Initially, it thumps a bit on ridges and is overly reactive on bumps, but a hex-key slackening of the reservoirs’ low-speed compression adjustment smooths things off, allowing the Nomad to parry rather than buck. On the dry and quiet single-track roads, I switch the ECU to its 305bhp, 382lb ft maximum, and the result is a bit like being towed down a garden path by an SR-71 Blackbird. Following a pronounced gulp of forced induction, there’s mighty and sustained pull above 2000rpm and the deep, bellowing exhaust is punctuated by fits of thrashing from the turbo and refreshingly uncontrived pops on the overrun. In fact, it’s more push than pull, as the rear hunkers down on its generous springs and boots the Nomad onwards. Roll is pronounced, too, but given the steering’s unerring faithfulness and the security of the Willans harnesses, it threatens neither stability nor comfort and positively contributes to engagement. The nose is tacked down now, and with the traction control eased there’s a brief slide available from the rear through tight bends as light sand billows around us like icing sugar. Driving the Nomad here is an addictively intense experience. It’s only a 30-minute drive end to end, but every road on Tiree seemingly leads to another gorgeous, silvery beach lapped by luminous blue water: surfers and windsurfers are spoiled for choice. But in Hutchison’s day, they were as useful as they were beautiful: “The level sands of Tiree furnish the islanders with their best roads and form splendid natural highways, repaired twice daily by the tide. The long drive or walk over these on first arrival is a delightful and uncommon experience. “The tree was met by the minister himself and triumphantly conveyed in his pony-trap across three miles of glittering sands to its destination at the little chapel of Ruaig.” Retracing the clergyman’s tracks, we clamber over the verge onto sprawling Gott Bay beach – Tiree’s longest, and a full 300m wide at today’s low tide. The mirror finish promised by Hutchison endures, and huge flocks of birds swoop towards their own reflections, undeterred by the Nomad’s visual and aural noise. Thankfully, none tries to nest in us. Washboard ridges are smoothed out with a little speed, although the slimmest layer of standing water prompts gentle fishtailing from both ends as the helm goes light. The minister’s nag would have calmly plodded through the several burns that traverse the beach, whereas Nomad, spruce and driver alike get drenched by water bombs as if each front wheel has disturbed a landmine. The east end of the beach is dead smooth and firm, and I resist a strong urge to untie all the horses. Some call Tiree ‘the Hawaii of the north’, but it could equally be Scotland’s Pendine or Daytona. It’s barely a minute from the beach’s terminus to the tiny chapel, built in the 1850s and once home to a happy congregation of 400. During Hutchison’s visit it was used as a temporary classroom following a schoolhouse fire; now it’s home to artist Matt MacIntyre and his wife Christine, with the ‘machair’ – the wild, coastal meadows – their broad, green driveway on which the sand shakes from our tyres. Along with friends and family, they give us a warm island welcome, with home baking and tea. Christine attended Sunday school here as a child before the chapel closed around 1970; Matt bought it unseen as a shell to renovate in 1998. “I cried when I saw the state of it,” he says. “There was sand on the floor, skeletons of hares and sheep and old oars lying around.” Now it’s a cosy cottage-cum-studio with heavenly coastal views. But we have one final duty to perform, as Hutchison wrote: “There was much excitement when the waving green tips were pushed through the doorway. The tree was carried in like a gigantic baby in the arms of three of the older boys and deposited along the backs of the pews against the wall, where it exhaled a delightfully fresh odour of resinous sap in the stuffy little chamber.” Matt, his grandson Matthew and I loose the spruce from the Nomad, lift it inside, mount and light it by the window, whose sill is fashioned from one of the very same initial-carved pews.  A centenary tree for treeless Tiree.  A life less ordinary Across her 92 years that spanned from Queen Victoria to Thatcher, Isobel Wylie Hutchison quietly yet determinedly overachieved. The head start of a privileged childhood gave way to tragedy and turmoil after her father and brothers died in her youth, but Hutchison found both solace and fascination in exploration. Scottish walks, such as the 150-mile length of the Outer Hebrides, led to a solo 260-mile crossing of Iceland in 1925, completed in just 14 days. Immersive stints in Greenland and a six-month odyssey across Alaska and the Yukon followed. She learned the native language of each. She preferred to walk but would travel by any means necessary: Bellanca mail plane on skis, wood-burning paddle steamer, ice-breaking schooner pungent with seal blubber, pony, kayak or dog-sledding at -41deg C. Her works as a writer, poet, botanist, speaker, artist and documentary maker found homes with National Geographic, Kew Gardens, the British Museum, the BBC and the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. Two of her great loves – Scotland and Christmas – travelled with her, from a kilt worn over Inuit sealskin boots to provisions including “my Christmas dinner of tinned haggis, tinned plum pudding and a bottle of French brandy with which to set the puddings ablaze”.",

The Argentine duo of Marcelo Obarrio and Germán Karp works on myriad makes and models, constantly flitting between different build styles. So if you give them carte blanche on a project, you can bet they’ll deliver something highly imaginative—like a Royal Enfield bobber with a bespoke frame and a dazzling livery. The Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 [known as the INT650 in the USA] is a cracking donor bike for a custom build. It’s not crazy expensive, its parallel twin engine is easy to get along with, and it looks great out of the box with lots of room for tweaking. But for Marcelo and Germán, this particular project called for something more… “A client came to us asking to make a bobber out of his Interceptor 650, but it had to be different,” Marcelo tells us.…",

    "description": "Right-sized premium. That’s how I’d describe the Audi Q3, and for me, this is a brilliant formula for a city like Mumbai. You want a car that’s manageable through the narrow and crowded streets but also something that isolates you from the chaos in a nice premium ambience, and that’s what the Q3 does well.  Despite the sloping roofline, the Q3 Sportback can take in large cargo easily. The dimensions are just right, placing it between the Creta and Hector; the steering is light and easy, and the ride is comfortable. Perfect, then, for chaotic city streets with surfaces in various states of (dis)repair. And then there’s the insides, which I really like a lot. Some will find the interior lacking flash and dazzle, but I really like these straightforward, sensible and quality interiors. This may be the baby of the Q range in India, but there’s no skimping on quality. The insides are very well made with high-quality bits, and the switches and controls operate with a nice heft. But what I really like about the insides is that everything is so logical, and that, surprisingly, is a hard thing to find these days.  The centre console is so logically designed. Oddly, that’s a rarity these days. There’s the option of traditional dials on the digital IP, and the design is clear and easily legible. And then there’s the centre console, which has everything so well laid out. I think I posted on Instagram some time ago about this being the perfect centre console. The touchscreen is neatly integrated into the dash and very easy to reach with a natural drop-down of your hand from the steering wheel. Below that is an HVAC button bank; physical controls are always welcome, and these fall easily to hand as well. And the dials operate with a click, which is easily felt and audible, too. The leather/leatherette combo has no perforation, and the seats aren’t ventilated. Below that is the media controller, placed closer to the passenger; the driver, after all, has steering controls. Below that is another button bank for the drive-mode selection – again, far better than touch controls – and the buttons are large and easy to hit while on the move. USB ports are easy to access and right next to the phone storage cubby, which is deep enough for larger phones and has a recess to keep the phone in place. So yes, oddly specific as this may seem, the Q3 centre console is really well-designed – not something you can take for granted these days.   HVAC knobs feel great and operate with a quality feeling and sounding click. The seats are comfortable and supportive, though I would have liked them to be cooled, and the material isn’t perforated either; so you can get sweaty on a hot day. The rear is a comfy place to be, but my son, who is now taller than me, does find the headroom tight; that’s the trade-off you make with the Sportback.  It misses out on a 360-degree camera, and the rear view camera isn’t very sharp. Speaking of the Sportback, I had to transport a large wheelchair recently, which, in our long-term Creta, pretty much filled the boot. While Audi says the internal volume of the Sportback and the SUV-body-style Q3 is identical at 530 litres, I thought the tapering roofline might pose a problem for the large box. But it fit very easily inside the boot. So, the boot does take in a lot, and this is with a space-saver spare below. I’ve got a trip to Goa coming up soon, and as I write this, I’m beginning to think that the Q3 would make a good car for it. The 190hp, 2.0-litre TFSI engine is a delight. Sure, handling isn’t sharp; it’s more neutral, but that’s fine. With my daughter quite prone to motion sickness, I hardly carve up the corners, and even if I do indulge in some spirited driving, I think the Q3 will have tidy body control and thus reduce the chances of motion sickness. If I do end up taking this to Goa, I will include it in the next report.

    "description": "The Honda Elevate CVT entered our long-term fleet at a time when a number of its segment rivals were already present. But while the others were in demand – the Hyundai Creta IVT for its easy-going nature, the Toyota Hyryder for its frugal strong-hybrid and the Skoda Kushaq 1.5 TSI for its performance – the Elevate was, in a way, overlooked. When the time came for me to hand over the keys to the Creta and take the Honda, I was intrigued to see what it had to offer. Having spent over a month with it, here’s what my experience has been like. Responsive and peppy 1.5 engine is fun in traffic, allowing you to close gaps quickly. Starting from the exterior, I’m a big fan of the way this SUV looks. The tall, squared-off stance, the imposing grille and the minimalist yet stylish rear end all look cohesive and give it a really good road presence. You jump in, and things get even better. The dashboard has a neat, uncluttered layout, and there aren’t too many textures and colours, which I like. The wood panel on the dash is tasteful, and so is the tan colour for the upholstery. The slick touchscreen has been glitch-free. The seats are also supremely comfy and support you in all the right places. However, I find the lumbar a bit excessive, and I would have liked the seats to have ventilation and power adjustment. My parents also appreciated the easy access to the rear seat and the space offered here. Overall, I really grew to appreciate the Elevate’s mature demeanour. And that goes for the way it drives, too. Bonnet flares help you place the car in tight spots. The ride is well-judged, as the Elevate just takes road imperfections in its stride and feels composed doing so. The engine, though a bit noisy, is eager to respond, which helps in darting through the gaps in traffic. This, coupled with the elevated seating and easy-to-twirl steering, means it’s a breeze in traffic. What’s also really useful are the flares on either end of the bonnet, which help you place the car. These are particularly useful, as it doesn’t have a front camera or parking sensors that should have been there. It lacks plenty of features, such as cooled seats, pano sunroof, 360-degree camera, etc.. Fuel efficiency has also been respectable, hovering around the 10-11kpl mark in the city. In our time with this SUV, the efficiency rarely dipped to single digits, which is impressive because it has no mild-hybrid assist or fuel-saving auto start/stop tech. What’s also nice is that the on-board computer is quite accurate with its economy readings. In my short time, I wasn’t able to stretch the Elevate’s legs on a highway, but drives on Mumbai’s eastern freeway and the new coastal road point to a good road trip companion, especially considering it also has a class-leading 480-litre boot. Despite no hybrid or auto start/stop tech, its efficiency remained around 10-11kpl. However, there are things that I haven’t gelled well with. The audio system is not good, especially since I’m moving from the Creta, which has a great-sounding Bose system. The other irritant is that you have to turn off the ADAS functions every time you start the car, unlike the Creta, in which it stays off. And I have to do that given Mumbai’s chaotic roads. It’s also only a camera-based system and not the more sophisticated radar-based system offered by rivals. Then there’s the feed from the cameras, which is low-res and choppy. Speaking of which, the blind-view camera’s feed appears on the touchscreen, so you lose the navigation feed for a few seconds when you’re about to make a turn. Moving from the Creta also highlights the paucity of features. Even in top-spec ZX form, it misses out on kit, such as a 360-degree camera, panoramic sunroof, electric handbrake, drive modes and more. Even the roof liner is woven and not the more premium, knitted type. Seat cushioning is very well-judged; it will take the pain out of a long journey. But while I did miss these features, the little things I did appreciate were the tactile switches for the AC controls, which don’t require me to take my eyes off the road, and the neat, well-executed and customisable part-digital instrument cluster. So, on the whole, it’s a car that’s got the fundamentals right, and it grows on you in a jack-of-all-trades way. And while it’s a frill-free SUV, it’s a fuss-free one, too.

    "description": "JSW MG Motor India has officially revealed key details about its highly anticipated Cyberster electric sportscar. Scheduled for a January 2025 launch, the Cyberster will be available through MG Select, a new sales channel dedicated to the brand’s forthcoming line of \"premium vehicles.\" The India-spec Cyberster to get 510hp, 725Nm AWD setup To be sold as a fully imported unit here Mifa MPV to join Cyberster at Select outlets later MG Cyberster battery, motor specs Confirming our earlier report on the electric vehicle, the MG Cyberster will be powered by a 77kWh battery pack (110mm thickness), paired with two oil-cooled motors on each axle, simulating an AWD setup. This powertrain produces 510hp and 725Nm of peak torque, with a claimed 0-100kph sprint time of 3.2 seconds. MG claims a maximum range of 580km on a single charge (CLTC cycle). For enhanced traction and stability, the MG EV will be equipped with a front double wishbone along with a rear five-link independent suspension. High-speed stability is further helped by a 50:50 front and rear weight distribution. Depending on the response, JSW MG may consider bringing the Cyberster RWD to India in the future. MG Cyberster design The Cyberster draws inspiration from the MG B Roadster of the 1960s, featuring a soft-top, two-seater configuration. Notably, it debuts scissor doors on an EV with dual radar sensors and an anti-pinch mechanism for added safety. According to regulatory filings, the wheels are expected to be between 19 and 20 inches, reinforcing its sporty stance. Its rear haunches and side skirts also maintain a pronounced look. At the back, a connected LED strip spans the width of the car, beneath which sit left- and right-arrow-shaped tail lights and an aggressive split diffuser. MG Select retail channel details Dedicated to NEVs (New Energy Vehicles) – including EVs, PHEVs, and hybrids – the MG Select outlet will initially bring four new products, which will be assembled locally. The Select channel will offer entry-luxury models and will be a standalone facility with workshops. MG plans to launch 12 Select experience centres across India in the first phase and gradually expand in a phased manner, eventually reaching Tier 2 cities. MG Select Chief Growth Officer Gaurav Gupta earlier stated that the channel will be distinct from the existing MG Channel, which will continue as the mainstream brand, with no overlap between the two. “To begin with, we are looking at products that will help us put a stick in the ground in the entry-luxury space. We feel there’s a lot of opportunity to offer something fresh to the customer, and we will have a good mix of product, pricing, and experience,” he added. After the Cybertser, MG plans to bring the Mifa 9 MPV, which will also be showcased at the upcoming Bharat Mobility Expo.

    "description": "After revealing the updated Speed Twin 900 back in October, the bike has now been launched in India at Rs 8.89 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi). The bike has seen significant visual and hardware changes but the engine has been left relatively untouched. USD fork, radial front caliper is new for 2025 Now uses same circular display as Trident 660 Available in three colours  Triumph Speed Twin 900 details The 900cc parallel-twin engine is rated for the same 65hp and 80Nm as before and the 5-speed gearbox is carried over as well. This engine is now compliant with the latest Euro 5+ regulations. Compared to the old bike, the big change is in how the Speed Twin 900 looks. This is a far more minimal design with more blacked-out elements, and it more closely resembles the Speed Twin 1200 now. The 2025 bike also employs a non-adjustable Marzocchi USD front fork as well as a Triumph-branded (J.Juan manufactured) radial caliper. The Speed Twin 900’s seat height has now risen to 780mm (up from 765mm), but with the accessory low seat, you can drop it to 760mm. Gone is the single-pod digi-analogue display, and it has been replaced by the same TFT unit seen on the bigger 1200 models. The switchgear, too, is shared with the bigger Speed Twin models. The electronics suite includes Road and Rain riding modes along with cornering ABS and traction control. Three colours are available on the Speed Twin 900 and deliveries are expected to begin by January 2025. With the Rs 8.89 lakh asking price, the most affordable Triumph modern classic is now Rs 40,000 dearer.",
