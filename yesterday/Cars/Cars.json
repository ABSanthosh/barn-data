    "description": "TVS never stops updating its flagship 310cc models, and for 2025, the naked RTR 310 gets some small visual and electronic changes. The overall character of the bike remains unchanged, but these additions have made a noticeable improvement to the refinement of the riding experience. TVS Apache RTR 310 Design and Features - 9/10 India’s most feature rich bike gains some new tech The visual changes are limited to new handguards with aluminium frames, sequential turn indicators and a new transparent clutch cover like on the RR 310. There are also four new colours, although two of these will cost you extra; more on prices later.  The keyless fob is part of the Dynamic Pro Kit. The final physical feature addition is a keyless start and handlebar system, which is available on one of the two optional BTO (Built to Order) packages. However, there are multiple electronic changes as well.  Even the base variant comes standard with a TFT display. The 5-inch TFT display gets some revisions to its display layout. For the most part, it operates well, although there is a bit of a delay between your request for a riding mode change and the screen acknowledging it. One optional extra that is no longer available is the cooled seat. It was a great attempt at a valuable feature, but the comfort factor was a problem that couldn’t be solved. The new Apache RTR 310 otherwise continues to be a sharp and handsome motorcycle with an aggressively raked rear seat, an aluminium subframe and a powerful LED headlamp. TVS Apache RTR 310 Engine and Performance - 8/10 Still packs stronger performance than the spec sheet suggests, but with some improvements One of the most significant upgrades here is that TVS has recognised that the RTR 310 felt a little ‘untamed’ and has worked on increasing the smoothness of the throttle response. The company has created what it calls torque filtering, whereby the ride-by-wire system monitors not only how much the throttle is open but also how quickly it has been opened and then decides on the engine response accordingly. In function, it works quite well because the throttle response in city traffic, even in Sport mode, is now smoother and more predictable. The previous RTR was fun, but it never felt like it wanted to settle into a calmer state, which could get tiresome on a daily commute. Now, the bike feels more relaxed when you want, but the system gives you great response when you ask for it with a quicker throttle opening. TVS has achieved the objective of smoothing the throttle response, but the feeling of the system remains quite synthetic, and it lacks the natural feel of a throttle cable.  The clear clutch case adds to its style quotient. The addition of launch control is a new feature, and while it’s hardly something people will use often, it is a fun gimmick to have. Another electronic aid is Drag Torque Control, which basically assists the slip/assist clutch in smoothing out multiple aggressive downshifts. This is something already seen on some big bikes, and it opens the throttle valve slightly to feed the engine a small amount of fuel, which counteracts the reverse torque coming from the wheel under hard downshifts. Again, this is something most customers won’t notice, but you can switch the system off in the menus, and there is a perceptible difference in the smoothness at the rear wheel when hammering in three or four fast downshifts. The 312cc engine is otherwise mostly the same, and it remains at 35.6hp, unlike the RR 310 that was recently bumped up to 38hp. What has changed is that the RTR 310’s final drive gearing now matches the RR 310, which means the rear sprocket size has reduced by four teeth. The bike is still quite short-geared in nature but no longer excessively so. Its overall styling remains unchanged, barring a few small additions. Performance and refinement levels from this 4-valve liquid-cooled engine are largely the same since the last update in 2024, when TVS worked on reducing the perceptible vibrations. This is an exciting and quick-revving motor, and you will still feel varying levels of buzzing in the seat, fuel tank and footpegs at different points in the rev range. Thankfully, it is no longer as harsh as it was when it was first launched in 2023.  You can read our previous road test to get an understanding of the performance on offer here, and the RTR punches above its weight, even out-accelerating more powerful rivals like the Triumph Speed 400. A beautifully smooth bi-directional quickshifter only adds to the experience.  Engine2025 TVS Apache RTR 310Engine312.12 cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooledOutput35.6hp at 9,700rpmTorque28.7Nm at 6,650rpmGearbox6-speed   TVS Apache RTR 310 Suspension Comfort, Handling and Brakes - 8/10 No changes to the way the bike handles The new RTR 310 carries the same chassis, suspension, brakes and tyres, and it also weighs the same 169kg, so there’s no surprise that it continues to ride as before. The seating position is well-judged for the road, with a mildly sporty lean down to the wide handlebar but good comfort in the footpeg placement. The 800mm seat height is friendly for short riders, and even tall folks will fit well on this bike. Things are a little different on track because there’s not a lot of room to slide back and tuck down. This is both thanks to the big pillion seat bump-stop and the large TFT that you’ll find right in front of your helmet when crouched down. Despite these compromises, on-track handling is really very good, and the bike feels light, agile and quick-turning but also comfortingly stable.  Our test bikes had the optional adjustable suspension, which most riders won’t need on the road, but it can be a good benefit on track. Another small improvement I noticed was that while this RTR’s traction control used to be unnecessarily intrusive (even in Track mode), that’s no longer the case, and I didn’t find the need to turn it off.  The Michelin Road 5 tyres provide a surprisingly sharp and fast transition in how the bike leans over to its side, but there’s superb grip once you’re there. The brakes feel the same as well, in that they have a slightly dull initial bite but good power once you put some effort into the lever.  The Michelin Road 5 tyres offer superb grip. However, as before, the RTR’s on-track limit arrives a little too early thanks to the footpegs scraping the tarmac. This was improved to some extent by removing the feeler bolts, but it didn’t solve the problem. Adding more suspension preload would have helped increase the cornering clearance, but it wasn’t something we had time to try at this event.  At the end of the day, the TVS RTR 310 is a very encouraging bike on track, and I wanted to keep reeling in the laps, but it’s not designed to particularly excel there. For those who want a sporty street naked that they clearly intend to take to the racetrack, the KTM 390 Duke will be the more rewarding choice. And on that note, it’s time to move to the price. Key specs2025 TVS Apache RTR 310Kerb weight169kgSeat height800mmFuel capacity11 litresGround clearance180mmWheelbase1358mm TVS Apache RTR 310 Price and Verdict - 8/10 More kit and features for a lower price than before  The good news is that TVS is offering introductory prices that are Rs 10,000 less than they were before. However, the RTR’s pricing is a rather confusing topic because it places the bike in two different lights. This bi-directional quickshifter adds to the overall experience. On the one hand, the base bike at Rs 2.4 lakh ex-showroom Delhi is a fantastic value because it offers much stronger performance than the likes of the KTM 250 Duke and still has valuable features like the Michelin Road 5 tyres, 5-inch TFT, traction control and cruise control. Our pick would be to pay the extra Rs 13,000 for the bi-directional quickshifter because it really does enhance the experience. Above that, you have the choice of adding the BTO Dynamic kit, which adds adjustable suspension, tyre pressure monitoring and a brass-coated chain. This takes the price to Rs 2.75 lakh. Instead of the Dynamic kit, you can add the Dynamic Pro kit, which introduces keyless start and a huge array of electronic rider aids that include cornering ABS, cornering traction control, anti-wheelie, anti-stoppie, and a whole lot more. This will increase the sticker price to Rs 2.85 lakh. If you add both the kits, the price goes to Rs 3.03 lakh. On top of this, the Fiery Red colour will set you back by a further Rs 5,000, while the Sepang Blue costs a massive Rs 15,000. At this point, the RTR 310 costs significantly more than a KTM 390 Duke, and while we salute TVS’ efforts towards introducing segment-leading technologies, they’re not essential with this performance level, and they push the price into the realm of unreasonableness. Opting for the fully loaded variant with BTO packs can push the price well beyond Rs 3 lakh. To sum up, then, the RTR 310 is either a surprisingly good value motorcycle that punches above its weight or an excessively expensive motorcycle that is completely out of its depth. It all depends on which variant you choose.   PriceVariantColourPriceBase without QuickShifterBlackRs 2.40 lakh TopBlack, Red and YellowRs 2.57 lakhDynamic KItBlack, Yellow, Red and BlueRs 2.75 lakhDynamic Pro KitBlack, Yellow, Red and BlueRs 2.85 lakhDynamic + Dynamic Pro KitsBlack, Yellow, Red and BlueRs 3.03 lakh Also see: 2025 TVS Apache RTR 310 video review",

    "description": "It’s no secret Tesla is not your traditional car company and, as such, does things rather differently. In a fittingly unpredictable and chaotic series of events, the brand went from uncertain about India plans to sudden Mumbai showroom opening to surprise Model Y launch to “your test drive is at noon tomorrow” in the blink of an eye. The media test drive, too, is unlike any other we’ve seen before. 1.5 hours on a fixed route with two Tesla representatives in the car at all times. Suffice it to say, this will be merely a teaser, rather than an outright review, but we relish the opportunity nonetheless. This is, after all, a brand and a model that has sparked intrigue with Indians for years, and it’s finally here in the spec that customers will buy. 2025 Tesla Model Y Exterior Design and Engineering – 5/10 Futuristic, oddball design that is entirely function over form. The shape of the Model Y allows it to cut through the air as cleanly as possible. To call the Model Y an SUV is a stretch; crossover would describe it more accurately. It does appear to have sufficient ground clearance, which on global models is listed as 167mm (unladen), the window sill is high, and though the roof is tall, it arcs down to the edge of the tailgate like a fastback. It’s all in the name of aerodynamics, allowing the Model Y to carve the cleanest possible line through the air, and contributing here are its new, smoothened-out face, flush door handles and 19-inch wheels with aero caps. The new split headlamp treatment features an LED bar that connects the DRLs, with the headlamps moved into slim vestibules below. Surround cameras tucked away in the front flanks and B-pillars. There are some interesting details though, like the surround cameras hidden in the front flanks and the B pillars for more accurate angles of view, and the charging port hidden in the side of the left tail-lamp, motoring open when you tap it. There are some characterful creases in the bonnet and doors, but the coolest addition is the rear light bar that is actually hidden behind the trim piece, but shines onto the tailgate, illuminating the Tesla wordmark. Neat-looking rear light bar is hidden behind the trim piece. Speaking of the tailgate, it’s powered and can be remote opened and closed, and lifts to reveal a positively cavernous 938-litre boot, which expands to over 2,100 litres with the seats folded. You’ll find no spare wheel here, however, thought there is some underfloor storage and a nicely integrated foldable luggage cover. Should you want more storage still, there is a 117-litre frunk under the bonnet. The Model Y boot space is 938 litres, expandable up to a massive 2,138 litres. When it comes to the Tesla Model Y colours, there are 6 to choose from, but there’s a catch. Only Stealth Grey is standard, while the rest are paid options – Pearl White (Rs 95,000), Diamond Black (Rs 95,000), Glacier Blue (Rs 1,25,000), Ultra Red (Rs 1,85,000) and the one you see here, Quicksilver (Rs 1,85,000). 2025 Tesla Model Y Interior Space and Comfort – 8/10 Excellent use of space, though materials don’t befit the price. A huge 15.4-inch infotainment touchscreen takes centre stage in the cabin. You could credit Tesla for a lot of the trends we see in many modern EVs (and cars in general), and that’s plain to see here. The cabin works around a minimalist philosophy, removing as much clutter as possible for a clean and soothing look. It’s dominated by a 15.4-inch landscape-oriented touchscreen that operates almost every single car function. In fact, the only controls outside of it are the hazard light switch, a newly added indicator stalk, and a few controls on the steering wheel. The steering-mounted controls are among the few physical controls inside the Model Y. The effect is staggering; even with the standard all-black interior (black and white is a Rs 95,000 option), it gives a great sense of space, helped no doubt by strategic placement of contrast stitching, grey fabric trim and ambient lighting. However, fit and finish, while good, is not quite up to what you’d expect from a car of this price. And, minimalism aside, it’s quite a conventional dashboard design, with a T-shaped dashboard and a centre console dominated by dual wireless phone chargers and huge storage bins. The concealed AC vents and lack of instrument binnacle take some getting used to though. The front seats are high-set and comfortable with a decent amount of support. Rear seats are quite spacious and comfortable. There’s a second screen, but it’s not where you might think. It’s between the front seats for the rear passengers, and is surprisingly well featured, not just operating the HVAC, but also allowing for video playback, games and other apps. The rear seat itself is quite impressive too, with lots of head and leg room, excellent foot room under the front seats, and surprisingly good thigh support for an EV. Comfort is good, too, with nice cushioning, although there’s no rear-seat recline or window blinds. In fact, there’s no sunblind for the huge glass roof either, which could pose a problem in the summer. 2025 Tesla Model Y Features and Safety – 8/10 Huge and innovative features list but lack of buttons is frustrating. We have to address the lack of physical controls right up front, because clean as it makes the interior look, having to go two menus deep to perform even basic functions while driving is frustrating. Tesla encourages you to leave everything in ‘auto’ and let the car handle it for you, but having to adjust the AC vents via touch, moving the mirrors from the steering wheel, figuring out where in the menu the headlight controls are and even engaging Drive and Reverse via the screen seems like it would never stop being annoying. Main touchscreen is slick and smooth, but virtually every in-car function has to be executed through it. With that out of the way, however, what a screen it is! It looks incredibly crisp, the UI design feels near perfect, and it performs with the speed and fluidity of a high-spec gaming computer. Navigation uses Google Maps overlaid on Tesla’s own interface, and the two merge together seamlessly. It’s a generally clean look, but should you want more data, there’s a wealth of it available just a few menus away. It multitasks without a stutter, letting you run multiple apps free of lag, and you can even keep the crisp surround camera display on at all times. You can adjust the AC, watch movies, and play games on the rear entertainment screen. There are, incidentally, 8 cameras in total – 2 up front, 4 on the sides, 1 at the rear and 1 inside – and they are responsible for powering this car’s (in)famous autonomous driving tech – Autopilot. The feature is a Rs 6 lakh option in India, but one that will only be made available once legislation allows it, though whether it would be able to function here at all is anyone’s guess. Until then, you get ADAS features, like lane-keep assist, lane-watch cameras and blind spot monitoring, which work well. It also renders a scarily accurate real-time animation of vehicles and traffic around the car, which in Mumbai traffic was an amusingly chaotic (and distracting) mess. Massive panoramic glass roof lets in loads of light, but could be troublesome in the summers. The touchscreen appears and functions more like a tablet computer than a car’s infotainment screen, with an app for just about everything. You can pair your phone, yes, but it’s easier to just log into your favourite apps in the car itself, and let it sync up for you. There are games you can play, and even a host of ‘toy box’ apps to amuse you while you wait for a full charge, including a music composer, a sketch pad, a romantic fireplace mode and ‘emissions mode’, which lets you… simulate flatulence. Front seats are heated and ventilated. Other feature highlights include 9 airbags, a ‘sentry’ mode that records suspicious activity, a pet mode which keeps the AC running after you leave, a biohazard mode that purges the cabin of airborne impurities, heated and ventilated front seats, dual wireless phone chargers, the huge glass roof, and yes, that all-encompassing touchscreen. 2025 Tesla Model Y Range and Charging – 8/10 Good WLTP ratings and appears to hold its charge well. Model Y offers up to 622km of claimed range. The Tesla Model Y is available in two versions in India – the RWD and the RWD Long Range. The former uses an 63kWh battery and is rated at 500km of range on the WLTP cycle, while the latter uses an 83kWh battery and is rated at 622km of range. Those are good numbers relative to rivals, and though we were not able to do a range test in our short time driving the car, we did note that with regen activated and ‘standard’ drive mode in use, its indicated range depleted quite slowly. It's also worth noting that while the Model Y uses the NACS (North American Charging Standard) plug in the US, in India, it is equipped with the more commonly used CCS2 charging port. While specifics are tight, Tesla says the Model Y can gain 267km of driving range in just 15 minutes using one of its high-speed Superchargers, which will be installed in key locations across India. The Model Y RWD maxes out at 175kW fast charging, while the Long Range can charge at up to 250kW. 2025 Tesla Model Y Performance and Refinement – 8/10 Silent and strong, but rivals feel more ‘ludicrous’. The Model Y sprints from 0-100kph in as little as 5.6 seconds. Here too, Tesla is shy with the numbers but it says the Model Y RWD does 0-100kph in 5.9sec, while the RWD Long Range does it in 5.6sec. This is because not only are their battery sizes and ranges different, their power outputs are too. Both models use a single motor mounted on the rear axle, but the RWD power output is 299hp, while the long-range produces 340hp, and both cars have a top speed of 201kph. These numbers fall shy of rivals like the BYD Sealion 7 and Volvo EC40 and on par with the Kia EV6, though all the others are offered with dual-motor AWD setups. Again, a more thorough test will reveal more, but our initial impressions of the standard RWD version in Mumbai traffic revealed a benign and predictable power delivery that should be easy to get used to, even for first-time EV owners. There are only two power modes – Standard and Chill – and the latter, as the name suggests, dulls responses. Moreover, there are two regen modes – Reduced and Standard – which feel poles apart. The former appears to offer almost no resistance, while the latter is strong and allows for one-pedal driving. Between the two sets of modes, buyers should be able to find a comfortable compromise. 2025 Tesla Model Y Ride Comfort and Handling – 7/10 Firm but solid ride and predictable handling. 19-inch alloys contribute to clunky low-speed ride, but things gets better as you speed up. On our short urban drive made up mostly of traffic and flyovers, again, there was little that could be ascertained. Steering modes are separate from the drive modes and can be set to three levels, though the differences between them felt minimal. There’s great manoeuvrability on offer, as all steering modes feel light and quick enough around town, though there isn’t a whole lot of feel or feedback. As a bonus, frontal and lateral visibility is great, thanks to that large glass area. While there are no adaptive dampers in the traditional sense, Tesla says the Model Y’s double-wishbone front and multi-link rear suspension ‘adjusts itself’ depending on the load exerted. Ride quality is on the firm side, giving it a solid, planted, feel that gets better as you go faster. However, at low speeds, it can feel a little clunky over potholes, no doubt in part due to those 19-inch alloy wheels. 2025 Tesla Model Y Price and Verdict – 6/10 Undeniable tech and wow factor, but too expensive for what you get. The Model Y is the right inaugural model for Tesla India. So yes, after a long wait and much uncertainty, Tesla is finally here, and what but the Model Y to kick off its India innings. For a time the best-selling car in the world, it’s a crossover with decent ground clearance and the more affordable of the two in Tesla’s stable. It’s everything Indian Tesla fans had been yearning for, especially after the 2025 refresh, which updated not only the looks, but also several functions. In fact, regular updates (mostly via software) are what Tesla is all about, which lets it keep its cars at the cutting edge, and its this startup-like approach that makes it completely unlike traditional carmakers. The heart, or rather the brain, of the Model Y is that central screen, and it truly is the main draw of the vehicle. Yes, there should have been hard switches too, but purely as a touchscreen, this one is a shining example to all carmakers. It feels like revolutionary tech, but there’s no getting around the fact that rivals are hot on Tesla’s heels, and in other aspects, have even gotten ahead. From a mechanical standpoint, many if not most do things better these days, with more power, more engaging handling and even a bit of character. The Model Y price is at the upper end of its segment. What makes that pill harder to swallow is the price, which is at the upper end of this car’s segment, and that’s assuming you choose the standard interior and exterior colour. Being a CBU import has subjected the Model Y to the full extent of EV taxation and duties, costing Rs 60 lakh for the RWD and Rs 68 lakh for the Long Range RWD (ex-showroom, India). At these prices, customers might expect a bit more in terms of perceived luxury and performance. That said, the Model Y didn’t become the global bestseller without reason, and there will no doubt be those for whom its state-of-the-art tech, spacious interior and bombastic brand value make it worth every penny.

    "description": "The Indian motorcycle industry has had a poor start to FY2026 with a sharp 9.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline in sales in the first quarter that ended in June. SIAM attributes this to inventory correction across the segment. Sub-200cc bike segments see varying degrees of sales drop TVS Ronin is seeing good sales growth after a slow start Royal Enfield’s share rises to 95 percent in the 250-350cc space Entry level bikes see sales drop as market trends change Of the 12 motorcycle segments, six have registered a YoY sales decline The frugal and hardy 100cc commuter bike segment is down 13 percent YoY with 13,06,541 units sold, a drop of 1,96,857 units. While Hero MotoCorp still leads (10,91,460 units; HF Deluxe, Passion and Splendor), it is down 8.63 percent YoY. Bajaj Auto (94,618 units; Platina 100) is down 24 percent, and Honda Motorcycle \u0026 Scooter India, with 49,318 units of the Shine 100, is down 55 percent.     The 100-125cc executive commuter category, with 8.6 lakh factory dispatches, is down 6 percent (Q1 FY2025: 9,13,793 units). The decline could have been sharper if it weren’t for a good performance by Honda, which leads this category with sales of 4,32,580 units of the Shine 125 and SP 125 models, up 11 percent (Q1 FY2025: 3,87,832 units). However, both the No. 2 and No. 3 players here saw their numbers decline – Bajaj Auto (2,11,559 units, down 6 percent; various Pulsar 125 models and the Freedom CNG bike) and Hero MotoCorp (1,10,282 units, down 39 percent; Glamour, Super Splendor and Xtreme 125R). Moving on from that, the 125-150cc bike segment saw the highest rate of sales decline: a substantial 37 percent to 1,10,299 units (Q1 FY2025: 1,74,934 units). Leader Bajaj Auto, with 47,054 units of its Pulsar models, is down sharply by 44 percent. Second-ranked Yamaha, with 37,228 FZs sold, is down by 7 percent, and Honda, with 26,017 units of the Unicorn, has seen a 49 percent drop. As for the 150-200cc motorcycle segment, even though it has witnessed a decline, it is just 2 percent, with sales of 3,27,744 units. This is the result of a growing number of commuter bike buyers upgrading to this larger displacement category. The main beneficiary of this is TVS Motor, with its four Apache models spanning 160 to 200cc. With sales of 1,36,118 Apaches, up 13 percent, TVS commands a 41 percent share of this bike category. Bajaj Auto (74,431 units), comprising the Pulsar, Avenger and KTM models, witnessed a 14 percent YoY increase in bike dispatches.   Third in this category is Honda, which sold 68,546 units (up 15 percent), with the likely bestseller being the SP160 and continued traction for the popular Hornet 2.0. Yamaha, with 36,467 units of the MT-15 and R15, has tanked 48 percent (Q1 FY2025: 69,945 units). Typically, the naked MT-15 regularly outsells the R15 sportbike owing to its lower price and more all-round capability. Hero MotoCorp, which sold 8,834 units of the Xpulse 200 and Xtreme 160 models, has seen a 41 percent YoY drop (Q1 FY2025: 15,137 units), and Suzuki Motorcycle India, with 3,022 Gixxer 150 bikes, is down by 10 percent (Q1 FY2025: 3,371 units). The 200-250cc category has registered sales of 38,157 units in Q1 FY2026, up 8 percent YoY from 35,197 units. This growth can be attributed to the strong demand for the TVS Ronin, which, with 14,530 units (up 157 percent), accounts for 38 percent of this sub-segment’s sales. The Ronin was off to a slow sales start, but the addition of refreshed colourways and more features on the lower variants seems to have helped its case. This puts the TVS Ronin below the numerous Bajaj bikes (Pulsar, Dominar, Avenger, Husqvarna and KTM), which have collectively sold 21,513 units, down 17 percent YoY. The 250-350cc category has done well – the 2,20,038 units sold here are up 13 percent YoY, and that’s thanks to the market leader Royal Enfield selling 2,08,659 units of its 350cc models, up 14 percent, and commanding a staggering 95 percent of the category’s total sales, up from the 94 percent in the year-ago period. While Q1 FY2026 has proven to be tough for the bike industry, the industry body forecasts some growth in the latter half of the fiscal year. According to SIAM, “The overall industry outlook remains cautiously optimistic. While the challenges from Q1 may continue to linger in the near term, several positive macroeconomic and seasonal indicators could support a gradual recovery.” These include the upcoming festive season, which typically serves as a demand driver, particularly for new two-wheelers, while the above-normal monsoon is likely to aid rural income recovery, which is especially important for entry-level vehicles that rely heavily on rural demand.

The look is an amalgam of styles, guided by one particular inspiration: vintage board track racers.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/mercedes-benz-class-remain-sale-until-2028",
    "description": "Entry-level hatchback faced the axe at the end of 2025 but has now been given three-year extension Mercedes-Benz will continue producing the current A-Class hatchback until at least 2028. The move comes despite repeated statements from CEO Ola Källenius that the popular hatchback, along with the B-Class MPV, would cease production at the end of 2025, bringing to an end two generations of models based on the company’s MFA platform. Mercedes originally touted a future compact car strategy built around four new models, all based on the new MMA platform: the CLA, CLA Shooting Brake, GLA and GLB - all of which will offer a choice of combustion and electrified drivetrains. However, Mercedes sources suggest they will now be supported by an upgraded version of today’s A-Class hatchback, of which production is claimed to have been extended by up to three years. The decision is understood to have been driven by continued demand for the seven-year-old ICE model, in combination with a slower than expected take up of Mercedes' newer electric models. Production of the A-Class Saloon ended earlier this year. Production of the A-Class hatchback is now expected to continue beyond the introduction of EU7 emissions regulations in late 2026, although it remains unclear whether existing petrol and diesel engines will be adapted to meet the new standards. Autocar understands that the A35 and A45 AMG hot hatches will be taken off sale because their M139 2.0-litre turbocharged engine does not comply with EU7, although there is not currently a time frame on when this will happen. Production is likely to shift to the Kecskemét plant in Hungary, as the Rastatt factory where it is currently produced has been repurposed for production of the new CLA and CLA Shooting Brake. The future of the B-Class remains uncertain, but Autocar understands Mercedes will stick to its original plan and cease production of the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer rival at the end of 2025. The extension of the A-Class hatchback’s model cycle coincides with a broader reshuffle of Mercedes' compact car line-up. Following the launch of the CLA, the CLA Shooting Brake is set to go on sale in the UK before the end of the year. The EQB will also bow out by the end of 2025. A new generation of the GLB, to be sold with the choice of ICE and electric drivetrains, is scheduled to begin production in Hungary in 2026. The next-generation GLA will follow as the final MMA-based compact model, arriving in late 2026 to replace both the existing GLA and electric EQA. While no successor to the A-Class is planned on the MMA platform, its prolonged production life reflects Mercedes' need to sustain compact car sales amid a broader shift toward electrification and high-margin luxury segments. In 2019, the brand’s compact car range peaked at 667,000 global sales. In 2024, that figure had declined to 534,800. In a statement sent to Autocar, Mercedes-Benz said: \"The A-Class continues to enjoy high demand among our customers, and we are currently in the lifecycle of this vehicle. Recently, the series was updated and enhanced with an extensive facelift - making this vehicle even more desirable for our customers. We do not comment on phase-out dates or portfolio decisions.\"",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/new-discount-makes-gwm-ora-03-one-uks-cheapest-evs",
    "description": "Range-topping Ora 03 GT has dropped from £32,995 to £29,245 Chinese brand matches government's new Electric Car Grant, cutting supermini's price to £21k The GWM Ora 03 has become one of the UK’s cheapest electric cars at £21,245, after the Chinese brand cut the model’s price by £3750 to match the UK government’s new Electric Car Grant. The ECG, announced last week, will discount new EVs (priced below £37,000) by either £3750 or £1500. These bandings will, however, depend on the cleanliness of the energy grid in the countries both where the EVs are assembled and where their batteries are manufactured. And to qualify for a discount in the first instance, a vehicle’s manufacturer must also be signed up to the Science Based Targets Initiative. These criteria have been described by industry insiders as a back-door method of excluding Chinese EVs from any grants while propping up those made in the UK and Europe – although the government has yet to publish a list of qualifying models. In response, some Chinese brands have introduced their own £3750 discounts on their EVs. Leapmotor was first, making its T03 city car the cheapest EV on sale in the UK, and GWM has now followed suit with the Ora 03. It means the Ora 03 now starts at £21,245, rather than the previous £24,995, undercutting the Citroën ë-C3 (£22,095), Renault 5 (£22,995) and Hyundai Inster (£23,505). It is possible, however, that those cars will become cheaper than the Ora 03 once the government publishes its list of cars approved for the ECG. The mid-rung Ora 03 Pro, with a 260-mile range, has been cut to £25,245, while the range-topping Ora 03 GT has dropped to £29,245. GWM said the discount can also be used as a deposit contribution on a PCP finance deal, requiring a smaller outlay from the buyer to access 0% APR rates. The move is almost certainly intended to boost sales of the Ora 03, which has struggled to generate much sales traction since its UK launch in late 2022 (as the Ora Funky Cat). According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, GWM sold 193 cars in the UK during the first half of this year, down from 895 over the same period in 2024.",
