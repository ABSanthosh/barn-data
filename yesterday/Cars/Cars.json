    "description": "Chinese motorcycle giant CFMoto has been making waves in overseas markets with a series of well-equipped, good-to-ride motorcycles that are sold with enticingly low price tags. As the company gears up to re-enter the Indian market after a short-lived first attempt in 2019, it invited us to its global launch event to experience some of its latest products. CFMoto 675SR-R design, engine The first of these was the new 675SR-R, which, on the surface, looks like a rival to the sub-100hp street-oriented sportbikes like the new Triumph Daytona 660, the Suzuki GSX-8R and the Honda CBR650R. This is why CFMoto’s decision to let us ride the bike on the mighty Portimao racetrack seemed puzzling at first, but it started to make sense once we met the bike. Unlike the above-mentioned rivals, this bike takes on more of a sporty identity with much more committed ergonomics that are closer to a proper supersport. The 675cc three-cylinder engine also sounds very supersport, and the immediate assumption is that it has been ‘benchmarked’ from the erstwhile Triumph 675 motor. However, the spec sheet reveals that the bore and stroke figures are quite different here, and this motor actually finds its roots in CFMoto’s 450cc twin-cylinder engine that receives one more cylinder here: 450 + 225 = 675. What you get is an engine that produces 88.6hp at 11,000rpm and 68Nm at 8,250rpm. The sound from the compact exhaust is similar to the Moto2 howl that you get from the Triumph and Yamaha triples, and it’s quite a loud note as well. CFMoto 675SR-R handling, performance Portimao is a wild circuit with huge crests and drops and plenty of blind sections, with no reference points to whether the next corner goes left or right. It took me a couple of sessions to learn the track well enough to be able to commit to proper speeds, and the 675 never felt out of its depth as the pace went up. The power on offer was perfect for my lack of track knowledge, and it resulted in a fast motorcycle but not one that was overwhelmingly so. What needs improvement is the throttle connection, which feels a bit too sharp on the initial opening and, occasionally, a little inconsistent. Midrange torque should be impressive on the street, but with the rollercoaster-like undulations on this track, it was vital to keep the revs up. However, the rev limiter hits quite hard, and running into that with the bike leaned over between corners was a little unsettling. Aside from these issues, the performance was strong and enjoyable, and I saw just over 220kph before braking for the first corner. The front suspension is fully adjustable. With twin 300mm front rotors and J Juan calipers, the stopping performance was actually quite impressive. There was good power and feel, although this circuit has more of a flowing nature without too many brutal hard-braking zones. The main issue with the brakes was that the ABS could be quite intrusive, and many riders elected to deactivate it for the final run by pulling the fuse. CFMoto 675SR-R ergonomics, underpinnings The SR-R weighs 189 kilos, and the seat height is 810mm – both pretty good numbers for a motorcycle like this. Suspension is handled by KYB components: a fully adjustable 41mm USD fork and a preload and rebound adjustable monoshock. The tubular steel chassis and aluminium swingarm, along with the KYB suspension, resulted in a sharp yet predictable riding experience, with the bike turning well and holding a line across this fast-flowing circuit. It didn’t feel out of its depth when thrown into some really fast corners, including the final turn – which is a long downhill right-hander that leads into the main straight – at nearly 180kph.  Aero makes up a big part of the 675’s design. Even the CST tyres were surprisingly good, and while the past experience with these Chinese tyres hasn’t been positive, the new semi-slick tyres on the SR-R were never a cause for concern. Chassis-wise, the only limiting factor was the footpeg feelers that ground down once the pace went up. CFMoto says that removing them will not be a problem, but it wanted to keep them on the bikes for this event as they help protect parts like the exhaust in case the bike goes down and slides along the tarmac.  CFMoto 675 SR-R features It’s no surprise that this is a well-equipped motorcycle, and it has a sharp, functional TFT display, along with dual-channel ABS, two-level traction control and a tyre pressure monitoring system. The traction control was smooth enough that I left it in its lower setting on the track without any issues. A cable-operated throttle means the SR-R only has a quickshifter, but CFMoto says it is working on a ride-by-wire system that will enable a blipper as well. There’s also an optional “T-Box” module with a 4G SIM that unlocks a myriad of connected features.  TFT display is smooth, informative and easy to read. CFMoto 675SR-R price, India launch On its own, the CFMoto 675SR-R is a good motorcycle that will probably be quicker than any of its sub-100hp rivals around a racetrack. There are a few blemishes in it that need to be polished out, but they’re all fixable, and at the rate that CFMoto is churning out new and impressive bikes, I don’t think it will be long before the company does so. But as you would expect with CFMoto, the real kicker here is the price, which, at 7,590 euros, is just 200 euros more than a Honda CBR500R. CFMoto is planning its India launch by the middle of this year, and while the 675 is not immediately on the cards, it is being considered for our market. If the company can manage to undercut its Japanese and British rivals by around Rs 2 lakh, as it does overseas, that will make this a very tempting option indeed. CFMoto 675NK quick review We also had the opportunity to ride the 675SR-R’s naked sibling, the 675NK. This bike is very closely based on its faired sibling, and it has the same chassis, suspension, tyres and engine. Power output is also unchanged at 88.6hp and 68Nm, and the NK even weighs the same 189kg. The main differences are in the design and the riding position, with the NK taking on a traditional streetfighter look and benefiting from a more comfortable riding position, thanks to the higher-set handlebar. The 675NK is mechanically identical to the 675 SR-R. We got to ride this bike on a large FIA-spec go-kart track, and it exhibited all the strong points displayed by its faired sibling. However, there were some inconsistencies in the throttle feel between the two bikes. Prices aren’t confirmed yet but expect to see the same aggressive positioning that places it against Japanese rivals from a segment below.

    "description": "The Hyundai Creta CVT has perhaps been the most in-demand car of the Autocar long-term fleet. Refined, comfortable and user-friendly, we’ve run this SUV for over 6,000km for shoots, commutes and road trips. Unfortunately, though, it’s now gone back to its maker, so I’m going to tell you what living with it was like. Most of my running with the Creta was done in the city, although Saumil and Hormazd did do some highway work on their road trips to Goa and Mahabaleshwar, respectively. Regardless of the usage, we agreed that this refined 1.5 petrol paired with the CVT auto makes for a seamless driving experience. And given that it especially excels in the city, it comes as no surprise that this atmospheric petrol engine outsells the other options. However, its lack of performance can be felt on the highways when you want to drive in a spirited manner. So, if performance is what you’re looking for, best opt for the 160hp turbo-petrol. Refined and seamless, the Creta IVT felt at home in city traffic. What it lacks in performance, it makes up for in fuel efficiency, by petrol SUV standards at least. In our instrumented real-world test, the Creta CVT returned a maximum of 15.05kpl on the highway, which went as low as 7.5kpl in bumper-to-bumper city traffic. Also worth noting is that the efficiency will drop drastically into single digits if you drive at a brisk pace on the highway. Overall, though, with my daily usage, the efficiency hovered between 10kpl and 11kpl for the most part. What also helps conserve that little bit extra is the auto start/stop function, which works decently. Although it livens up the cabin, the ivory upholstery soils easily and is tough to keep clean. Other than the refined and fairly efficient powertrain, I also appreciated the feature-rich and well-appointed cabin. The light grey and ivory upholstery and the copper inserts and stitching work well together, though it was nearly impossible to keep the ivory bits clean given the intensive running our Creta did. And in typical Hyundai fashion, our top-spec SX(O) Creta had all the bells and whistles like a panoramic sunroof, dual-zone auto AC, cooled front seats, two screens, ADAS and a 360-degree camera. The high-res 360-degree camera and blind-spot monitor, in particular, proved their worth in the rainy season when visibility was poor. Even the Level 2 ADAS features worked well, and I liked using the adaptive cruise control on the highway. What’s also nice is that if you turn them off, they’ll remain off till you manually turn them back on. I even appreciated the Bose audio system, but passengers in the rear did feel like the volume was quite soft. Reclining backrest, sunshades, armrest and neck pillows mean the rear seat is a comfy place. Speaking of the rear, it’s a great place to be. There’s enough room for three, and the pano roof and light upholstery make the cabin feel airy. And the reclinable backrest, sunshades, armrest and neck pillows seal the deal. However, not all is well, as the Creta does miss out on wireless smartphone integration, which is particularly annoying given that the smaller 8-inch screen in lower variants gets it. I also would’ve liked to have a sliding front armrest. The twin screens, while great to look at and easy to navigate, are set a little too low and don’t fall in your line of sight. And it doesn’t pack a heads-up display like the Kia Seltos, which would’ve alleviated this. It’s also not one for enthusiastic drivers, as handling can best be described as safe. Although there’s a noticeable body roll, the grip is ample, and overall, it feels predictable around bends. The ride quality is cushy at low speeds, but it feels jarring over sharp potholes, and large bumps tend to catch it out. There’s also some noticeable vertical movement at highway speeds, but this doesn’t feel uncomfortable like the Cretas of old. Full-LED headlamps offer great illumination and throw; the auto high beam function works well. Other things I liked in my time with the Creta were the LED headlights, which offer great illumination. The auto high beam function also worked well, meaning I didn’t have to constantly shift between high beam and low beam. It’s also nice that the Creta gets physical controls for the AC and some of the infotainment controls. I also managed to solve two things that were annoying me. The first one was that Android Auto was appearing only in a split screen, which was resolved by unchecking a box deep in the sub-menus of the system. The second was the lock/unlock beeps, which were done away with by long-pressing the lock and unlock buttons on the key simultaneously for a couple of seconds. I know we say this a lot, but this car will actually be missed a lot by all of us in the office. Given its strengths and how easy living with it has been, it’s not hard to see why the Creta continues to rule the midsize SUV segment.

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/2025-porsche-taycan-turbo-turbo-s-facelift-review-turbo-charged-434832#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Car+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "Then Porsche first introduced the Taycan, the enthusiasts said it was sacrilege. How could Porsche, renowned for some of the best ICE sports cars in history, slap its crest on a four-door, two-tonne electric sedan? But as usual, Porsche has proven naysayers wrong, as the Taycan is now known as the enthusiasts’ EV of choice. We can attest to that after setting the fastest lap time by an EV at the Buddh International Circuit in it, racing it against a sailing boat, and even drag-racing it against its petrol-powered stablemates. But Porsche is not one to rest on its laurels. There’s an updated version with even more performance now, and we sampled its Turbo and Turbo S variants in and around Dubai to see what to expect. 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo facelift exterior design The rear bumper and light signature have been mildly altered. You’ll have to be a real Porsche nerd to spot the design differences on this facelift; they are so subtle. It has more aero-efficient bumpers on the front and back, tweaked headlamps that now get LED Matrix tech as standard, a revised rear light bar and new colour and wheel options. Porsche lettering on tailgate lights up There’s even an option to illuminate the Porsche lettering at the back, which looks quite cool, and the Turbo and Turbo S also get the new ‘Turbonite’ satin-matte accents, which feature on the logo, too. 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo facelift interior and features Active air suspension aids cabin entry There’s good room behind, but you’re seated in a low and knees-up position. Before I even got inside, the Taycan showed off one of its party tricks. Air suspension is standard fit, but Taycans can now be equipped with the optional Porsche Active Ride system, which instantly lifts it off the ground by 55mm to ease entry into the cabin. While 55mm may not sound much, it makes a big difference, given how low-slung the Taycan is. The updated UI is more user-friendly; there are ‘Turbonite’ Porsche badges inside and on the exterior. The interior is more or less the same, but there are changes to the interface for the infotainment screens to make it more user-friendly. The Turbo and Turbo S also get the Porsche emblem finished in ‘Turbonite’, much like on the exterior, and buyers can opt for a fully leather interior or one with sustainable materials, in line with the EV’s green cred. The car retains its four-screen layout, including one for the passenger, which gets a special coating so that it can’t distract the driver. The rear seat has good room, but the seating position is low and knees-up. 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo facelift ride and handling 'Leans' while cornering to minimise body movement The Taycan's handling belies its near-2.3-ton kerb weight. Circling back to the new Porsche Active Ride, this system is a technological marvel. Sure, Dubai’s pristine roads aren’t the best place to judge a car’s ride, but the Taycan walks the tightrope between handling and comfort with precision like few others. Around bends, it ‘leans’ like a motorcycle to maximise corner speed, and it also compensates for body movements like squatting and diving while accelerating or braking. The entire system is so clever that it does without anti-roll bars. And despite sitting on huge 21-inch wheels (Turbo S), the ride feels quite supple. Carbon ceramic brakes are standard fitments Handling is typical Porsche, which means the Taycan corners flat, and there’s tremendous grip, too. With the way it changes direction, you won’t be able to tell it weighs nearly 2.3 tonnes. That, coupled with the sharp and responsive steering, makes it the best-handling four-door EV on the market. The brakes are immense as well, and you get a good feel from the pedal. It’s worth noting that the Turbo S gets carbon ceramic brakes as standard. 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo facelift performance 0-100kph takes 2.7 seconds Immediate power delivery helps the Taycan Turbo S match the 911 Turbo's performance. On the move, the Taycan Turbo feels absolutely manic. With a max output of 884hp and 890Nm from its dual-motor setup, there’s always so much power in reserve that you can barely floor the throttle for a couple of seconds before doing illegal speeds. Mind you, the limit is 120kph in certain parts of the UAE. From a standstill, 100kph is dismissed in just 2.7 seconds – that’s as quick as the 992-gen 911 Turbo! And as it’s an EV, there’s no delay or lag in performance. Moreover, the clever Porsche Torque Vectoring system keeps all wheels in check without losing traction. That makes acceleration almost a non-event, aside from the ferocity with which it launches forward – that simply scrambles your brain. But there’s no getting away from the distinctive lack of sound, which, in a Porsche of all the cars, is essential to the driving experience. Taycan Turbo S develops 952hp and up to 1,110Nm Next up is the Turbo S, which dials things up even further. Power is now up to an eye-watering 952hp (from 761hp) while torque is up to 1,110Nm (from 1,050Nm) with the ‘Overboost’ or push-to-pass function, which gives you full power for up to 10 seconds. The difference in performance between the Turbo and Turbo S is like splitting hairs. Porsche will tell you that the S does 0-100kph in just 2.4 seconds, 0.3 seconds quicker than the Turbo, but the truth is that both feel equally relentless. 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo facelift battery, range, and charging It now gets a larger yet lighter battery, more efficient regen braking and can accept charge up to 320kW. Besides the added performance, Taycans now get a larger 105kWh ‘performance’ battery that weighs less than the older 93kWh unit, revised electronics and more efficient regenerative braking. The results are more range and quicker charging times. Charging speeds bumped up by 50kW Both the Turbo and Turbo S have a combined claimed range of up to 630km (WLTP), but in urban conditions, the former is claimed to give up to 683km and the latter up to 691km. Both can accept charge at speeds of up to 320kW, up 50kW from before, and the max regen capacity is also said to have improved by 30 percent. 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo facelift price and verdict Taycan Turbo S not coming to India While the Taycan Turbo S isn't on the cards for India, the base 2WD, 4S, and Turbo are on sale here. In India, Porsche sells the Taycan 4S for Rs 1.89 crore and the Taycan Turbo for Rs 2.52 crore; the base two-wheel-drive variant is due for a launch soon. However, Porsche won’t offer the Turbo S or the Nürburgring record-holding Taycan Turbo GT here. Nevertheless, the performance from the more ‘regular’ Turbo is mind-numbingly fast, and the Taycan remains the most electrifying EV out there. The updates have only made it more compelling. Not only is it quicker, but it also has more range, can charge faster and has more tech. It remains the enthusiasts’ EV of choice – for a price, of course.

    "description": "New EVs are arriving thick and fast. Here's your guide to this year's entrants Like them or loathe them, electric cars are here to stay – and 2025 is looking to be their biggest year yet, with several major new models arriving on the market.  EV ownership is growing fast in the UK. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a record number were sold in 2024. Of the 1.95 million cars sold in 2024, 19.6% were electric - an increase of 16.5% year-on-year.  We’re expecting huge arrivals from established car makers – including Renault, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, Hyundai and Tesla – while newcomers such as BYD, Leapmotor and Xpeng fill their arsenals.  These range from your everyday electric hatchback to big electric seven-seaters. There’s also a host of electric sports cars to look forward to and even the odd electric supermini.  Let’s get straight into it, then. From Abarth to Xpeng, here’s every new EV coming in 2025.  Abarth 600e Performance version of Fiat's new small crossover gets up to 276bhp from a single motor, which should propel it from 0-62mph in 5.9sec. Some will feel let down by its range, though, with its 54kWh battery offering just 207 miles. Read our Abarth 600e review AC Ace Electric Classic British roadster is going electric, with a lightweight design (it comes in at just 1134kg), a 72kWh battery and a 300bhp electric motor. It will cost you around £212,000, however. Read more about the new AC Ace Electric Alpine A390 The first crossover to come from this French performance brand, the A390 will feature a tri-motor powertrain with active torque-vectoring, which is promised to make it feel far lighter than it actually is.

Just 2.9sec…  Read more about the Denza Z9 GT Fiat Grande Panda Fiat’s latest retro-inspired small car will cost less than £22,000 in both electric and hybrid guises. The EV will get a 44kWh battery and a 111bhp electric motor, producing somewhere in the region of 199 miles.  Read our Fiat Grande Panda review Ford Puma Gen-E Ford has electrified its best-selling model, the Puma compact crossover, with a 43kWh battery and 234 miles of range. A single front-mounted motor supplies 166bhp, 214lb ft of torque and a 0-62mph sprint time of around 8.0sec.  Read more about the Ford Puma Gen-E Genesis GV60 Magma This more upmarket alternative to the hot Hyundai Ioniq 5 N will adopt similar underpinnings, such as its 89kWh battery and 641bhp dual-motor powertrain. Its chief development manager said it's tailored for “the gentleman driver” but encourages driving in “an exciting, enthusiastic way.” Read more about the Genesis GV60 Magma GWM Ora 07 The Ora 07 is a saloon counterpart to the Ora 03 supermini (formerly the Ora Funky Cat), with a price expected to land below £35,000. In its most premium specification, drivers can expect 354 miles of range and crazy performance, with 402bhp from two motors. Read our GWM Ora 07 prototype review Hyundai Inster The £22,715 Inster is the first electric supermini from Hyundai. A heat pump, four seats and dual 10.25in dashboard screens are standard, in addition to a reversing camera and blindspot monitoring. A range of 223 miles can be extracted from its 49kWh battery.  Read our Hyundai Inster review Hyundai Ioniq 6 N Based on the success of the Ioniq 5 N, we’re expecting big things from the Ioniq 6 N sports saloon. It’s expected to use an 86kWh battery and dual electric motors for four-wheel drive, but its performance is the juiciest part: 641bhp and 549lb ft. We can’t wait.  Read more about the Hyundai Ioniq 6 N Hyundai Ioniq 9 Closely related to the Kia EV9, the Ioniq 9 comes with seven seats and a flood of technology, topping the Ioniq EV range in the process. The entry-level Long Range RWD model uses a single 215bhp motor, giving it an official range just shy of 400 miles. Read our Hyundai Ioniq 9 review Jeep Compass Electric Set to receive both petrol and electric power, the next-generation Compass will go into production in Italy later this year. It will get a 207bhp electric motor and a 73kWh battery pack, sitting just above the Avenger in the Jeep line-up.  Read more about the electric Jeep Compass Jeep Wagoneer S Jeep’s new flagship will offer incredible performance in the body of a rugged off-roader, with a claimed output of 592bhp and 516lb ft. Four-wheel drive comes from two motors, and 0-62mph will take just 3.4sec. Range is said to stand at over 300 miles. Read more about the Jeep Wagoneer S KGM 0100 The brand formerly known as Ssangyong's next pick-up truck will be an EV using mechanicals supplied by China’s BYD. Much of the hardware is shared with the Torres eVX SUV, including a choice of 73.4kWh and 80.1kWh batteries. No word on payload capacity, though. Read more about the KGM 0100  Kia EV4 Kia isn’t just relying on SUVs in 2025: its EV4 will breathe new life in the saloon class, rivalling the venerable Tesla Model 3. Versions coming to the UK will be offered with 215bhp front-wheel-drive and 320bhp four-wheel-drive powertrains.  Read more about the Kia EV4 Kia EV5 Effectively an electric Sportage, the EV5 follows the introduction of the seven-seat EV9 and compact EV3 crossovers. Battery sizes stretch from 58kWh to 88kWh and Kia says the biggest-battery model can offer 403 miles of range.  Read more about the Kia EV5 Kia EV9 GT The EV9 GT will be one of the fastest seven-seaters in the world, capable of hitting 0-62mph in just 4.3sec. Total power output stands at 501bhp, but it’s still to be revealed how this outrageous performance will impact the EV9's range.  Read more about the Kia EV9 GT Kia PV5 Kia’s entry into the commercial vehicle market will start with the 4.7m-long PV5. Based on a highly configurable platform, it will initially be launched as a cargo van and a seven-seat MPV, before a pick-up variant and an autonomous taxi arrive later down the line.  Read more about the Kia PV5 Leapmotor B10 Stellantis-backed Chinese car firm Leapmotor unwrapped this compact crossover at the 2024 Paris motor show, but we’re still awaiting battery and power figures. It should borrow from the larger Leapmotor C10 but come in even cheaper, at under £30,000.  Read more about the Leapmotor B10 EVC L380 London taxi maker LEVC has unveiled an eight-seat MPV with an interior inspired by luxury airline travel. It will come with a 268bhp electric motor plus a maximum battery size of 120kWh, so you can ferry people around for up to 432 miles.  Read more about the LEVC L380 Maxus Mifa 7 MG's commercial sibling brand is following its huge Mifa 9 with a smaller MPV to rival the Volkswagen ID Buzz LWB. Seemingly styled after a laptop, it has seven seats and a 255-mile range.. Read more about Maxus EVs Mercedes-Benz CLA The next-generation CLA has officially been unveiled as Europe's longest range electric car. It's set to be the most efficient EV too, with a claimed 492-mile range and an efficiency figure north of 5.0mpkWh. Read more about the new electric Mercedes CLA Mercedes-AMG CLA 45 AMG's patented axial-flux motors were supposed to be confined to the company's more expensive models. But the hot version of the CLA will get them too. Which means this super slippery efficiency-oriented EV will get 500bhp+ and an active aero package with an air brake. Everything we know about the Mercedes-AMG CLA 45 MG Cyberster GTS MG surprised us all when it announced a 2+2 coupé version of its recently launched Cyberster roadster. It's likely to carry the same battery and motors as the standard Cyberster but will feel more like an MG B than an MG F.  Read our MG Cyberster review MG ES5 The arrival of the ES5 would suggest the existing ZS EV isn’t long for this world. It’s based on the platform of the smaller MG 4 hatchback, which will contain what is claimed to be the world’s thinnest EV battery. Read more about the MG ES5 Nissan Leaf Sunderland is getting ready for production of the Mk3 Nissan Leaf, which has transformed from hatchback to crossover. It’s likely to use similar underpinnings to the Renault Scenic, which has 60kWh and 87kWh batteries for up to 379 miles of range.  Read more about the new Nissan Leaf Nissan Micra The reborn Micra supermini will take the underpinnings of the much-celebrated new Renault 5. The design and engineering work will be completed in the UK and we’ve been told to expect a “sporty urban” car.  Read more about the new electric Nissan Micra Onvo L60 Nio’s affordable EV brand, Onvo, will launch in Europe with the L60, an electric coupé-SUV that's claimed to be the most aerodynamically efficient EV on the market. It will offer a choice of proven BYD batteries, but range figures haven't yet been published. Read more about the Onvo L60 Peugeot e-408 Electric power comes to Peugeot’s stylish coupé-SUV. A 59.2kWh battery supplies power to a 207bhp motor and produces a range of 281 miles. Prices have already been announced, starting at £42,175 for the basic Allure model and rising to £44,945 for the GT.  Read more about the Peugeot e-408 Polestar 3 Single Motor Swedish brand Polestar’s biggest car drops a motor to gain extra range for a lower price. The 3 is based on the same platform as the Volvo EX90, so it should offer similar range and performance.  Read our Polestar 3 review Polestar 5 The Porsche Taycan won’t be sleeping easy with the 5 on its tail. That’s if its charging statistics are anything to go by. Polestar says the saloon's new tech means it can gain 100 miles' worth of charge in just five minutes while avoiding battery degradation. Read more about the Polestar 5 Range Rover Electric The Range Rover Electric might be the year’s most anticipated EV, with superb off-road ability and class-leading comfort expected. Technical details are still under wraps, but we’ve been told it should offer performance comparable to the V8-engined Range Rover. Read more about the Range Rover Electric Renault 4 This crossover sibling of the Renault 5 uses a 118bhp front-mounted motor and a 40kWh battery for 190 miles of range in entry-level form, or buyers can opt for a 148bhp motor and a 52kWh battery for 250 miles of range. Read more about the new Renualt 4 Skoda Elroq The second EV to join Skoda’s model range comes in the form of a well-rounded SUV with a £31,500 price tag. It should prove to be decent value for money, with 360 miles of range, charging speeds of 145kW and a well-rounded drive.  Read our Skoda Elroq review Skoda Enyaq facelift A sleek styling update means the Enyaq should remain competitive in the world of long-range electric SUVs. Its new face includes updated LED headlights, while aerodynamic improvements have bolstered its range by a single mile, from 358 to 359.  Read more about the new Skoda Enyaq Skywell Q The follow-up to Chinese EV maker Skywell's BE11 crossover, the Q hatchback claims a range of more than 300 miles. Power is punchy, at 201bhp, with a claimed 0-62mph sprint time of 3.9sec.  Read more about the Skywell Q hatchback Skywell Skyhome This Chinese limousine will look to upset the Mercedes-Benz EQS with sumptuous luxury. Aside from a roof-mounted TV, we don’t know all that much about its technological side. It is, however, claimed to produce 617bhp in dual-motor form. Read more about the Skywell Skyhome Smart #5 We can’t get enough of rugged electric SUVs, and the #5 ticks all the right boxes. Far larger than the #1 and #3, it's similar in size to the Peugeot 5008. It packs 637bhp in dual-motor form, while the biggest battery can hold a whopping 100kWh of energy. Read more about the Smart #5 Suzuki eVitara The first electric Suzuki will go head-to-head with the recently launched Mini Aceman. We’re expecting a range of around 250 miles from the eVitara's larger (61kWh) battery, while charging speeds of up to 150kW have already been confirmed.  Read more about the Suzuki eVitara Tesla ‘Model 2’ This should finally be the year that Tesla’s long-anticipated entry-level model – believed to be a hatchback – will arrive, supposedly costing less than £25,000.  Read more about the Tesla Model 2 Tesla Model Y facelift The Model Y’s new look aims to keep it at the top of the pile as one of the world's best selling cars, with sleeker aerodynamics and improved material quality. Rear passengers now get a touchscreen, and there’s a slight performance boost for the all-wheel-drive model.  Read our Tesla Model Y review Toyota bZ3X This compact crossover will be built as part of Toyota’s joint venture with Chinese brand GAC. It will sit below the bZ4X and be sold alongside a fastback version, named the bZ3C. Range is pegged at 373 miles. Read more about the Toyota bZ3X Toyota bZ4X facelift Toyota's electric SUV is set to get a smaller battery and a new face. The new 57.7kWh battery will be available alongside the 73.1kWh pack and will be exclusively paired with a single, front-mounted, 165bhp motor. Range will increase from 318 to 356 miles. Everything we know about the new Toyota bZ4x Vauxhall Frontera Vauxhall’s new compact crossover offers a practical interior and a headline-grabbing price. While the electric version's range is on the meagre side, at 188 miles, its boot is a Nissan Qashqai-esque 460 litres.  Read our Vauxhall Frontera review Volvo ES90 Volvo’s first electric saloon will act as the premium brand’s flagship, sharing much of its underpinnings with the tech-rich new EX90 SUV. It will undercut the SUV significantly, with prices starting from around £70,000. Its slippery shape should give it a range in excess of 400 miles. Read more about the Volvo ES90 Volvo EX30 Cross Country Volvo's smallest EV gets a rugged design overhaul including front and rear skidplates, while its ride height increases by 19mm. Beneath the metal, it gets softened suspension and all-wheel drive. It'll be everything a 'weekend explorer' will need, Volvo says.  Read more about the Volvo EX30 Cross Country",

    "description": "A 372-mile journey from Phoenix to California in a Bentley Continental GT is no hardship The US is so big that you tend to default to jumping on a plane for any intercity journey. Indeed, the Google Maps journey planner in North America treats plane journeys the same way as it does train journeys here. For example: Phoenix, Arizona, to San Diego, California, is given as a 1hr 25min flight for £77 or a six-hour, 372-mile drive. The former is the easy option and something often necessitated by time. Yet fortunate timing on recent back-to-back work events and a Bentley Continental GT that needed repatriating to California meant that I could at last take the latter option and go on a proper journey, rather than just a trip. Phoenix itself seemed to go on forever and was most notable from the road for its admirable commitment to listing every single fast-food outlet available at each highway junction. Once west of Phoenix, I headed south at Buckeye – less impressive than it sounds – then west again onto Interstate 8 at Gila Bend, a rather sad place that felt like it had been left behind by the modern world. A gas stop at Dateland gave me the first chance to stretch my legs, and naturally they had gone all in on the date theme inside the shop. Strikingly so. Row after row of sweet, shrivelled fruits in every form imaginable, from key ring to extra hot. The nice man behind the counter told me about a great burrito place for lunch up the road in Yuma, the only town of any significance en route. The food was more Yucka than Yuma in the end, but it’s the thought that counts. An Australian mate told me he loves the UK so much because you can travel only a few miles and end up in a totally different landscape. The Sonoran Desert is the complete opposite of that – a bit like the Aussie bush in that there’s almost nothing to report for mile after mile. ‘Big RV park at Fortuna Foothills’ reads one of my notes from the road. I will never speak ill of the M6 again. When crossing into California, it looks like the Sahara for a while, and there are some checkpoints, due to the proximity to Mexico, to add a bit of jeopardy. You can spy Trump’s big fence here, too. About five hours in, the desert ends, you cross the Laguna Mountains, climb up and then descend into San Diego – a quite peculiar place that seems largely deserted, save for a massive cordoned-off street that resembles Albufeira in Portugal, with bar after massive bar offering happy hour deals. Yet to whom? This all sounds a bit po-faced for a Why I love column, but that’s not the intention: these sorts of journeys become addictions, the banal becoming brilliant. Within about 30 minutes of being parked up in San Diego, I was ready to open another pack of dates and do it all again.",

The event is dripping with nostalgia and adrenaline, as contenders go head-to-head across the sands of Wildwood’s sprawling beach. This beguiling Harley-Davidson beach racer looks exactly like the type of motorcycle you’ll find at T.R.O.G. until you spot the beefy powerplant sitting at its center. It’s actually a modern Harley-Davidson Milwaukee-Eight Softail—masterfully redesigned by Gasoline Motor Co. to resemble a vintage machine and nicknamed the ‘Wildwood Beach Racer,’ as a nod to the iconic beach race. The Milwaukee-Eight Softail cuts a lovely silhouette in stock form, but the Australian custom shop’s vision for the bike called for more than just a light makeover.…",

It was sold as the CBF250 in Europe, and never made it to the States. But in countries like Argentina, it was (and still is) a hit. This peppy 2005-model Honda CBX250 Twister comes from Karma Motocicletas in Rosario—a city in central Argentina that lies on the west bank of the Paraná River.

    "description": "First previewed by a concept in September 2023, the Mercedes-Benz CLA has now been officially revealed as the brand’s new entry-level sedan with both EV and hybrid powertrains. In a first for Mercedes, the CLA EV and the CLA hybrid will share a common model name. This marks an end to Mercedes’ strategy of entirely bespoke EVs being developed to sit alongside their combustion-engined equivalents. CLA has been developed as an EV first, and then a hybrid Both EV and hybrid models look similar inside and outside India launch expected by end of 2025 Mercedes Benz CLA EV battery, range and powertrain CLA EV has more range than flagship EQS sedan The CLA EV line-up starts with the entry-level 250+ with EQ Technology that is claimed to deliver a range of 792km. Meanwhile, the all-wheel-drive CLA 350 4Matic with EQ Technology is claimed to deliver 770km. What’s notable here is the smaller range disparity compared to the rear-driven version than is typical of most other EVs. Do note that these figures are still pending homologation under the WLTP cycle. However, what’s really interesting is that the rear-wheel-drive CLA leapfrogs Mercedes’ own flagship EQS 580, which manages 770km WLTP range from a 118kWh battery. That remarkable range figure is thanks to Mercedes’ efforts to minimise the CLA EV’s energy consumption: it just has an 85kWh nickel-managanese-cobalt (NMC) battery. This means the CLA EV's efficiency is north of 9.0km/kWh. Comes in both RWD and AWD configurations The CLA EV’s new rear-mounted permanent magnet motor is also significant to its efficiency. It produces more output in a smaller package, is lighter and has greater torque density, too. The motor also gets a Porsche Taycan-style two-speed gearbox, rather than the usual single-speed reduction gearing. The powertrain puts out 272hp, which allows the CLA 250+ to complete the 0-100kph dash in 6.7 seconds. The four-wheel-drive CLA 350 4Matic with EQ Technology gets an additional 108hp motor with a single-speed gearbox on its front axle, giving a combined output of 354hp. This cuts its 0-100kph sprint time to 4.9 seconds. This additional motor is decoupled from the front axle when it isn’t needed, reducing energy losses to friction by 90 percent. Braking primarily relies on the motors’ regenerative effect (which can provide up to 200kW of stopping power), helping to keep the battery topped up. Can charge at up to 320kW, thanks to 800V architecture The CLA EV can be fast-charged at rates of up to 320kW, thanks to its 800V electrical architecture that allows for a 300km top-up in just 10 minutes. In addition to the 85kWh battery, a 58kWh lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) pack will also be offered at a later stage. Mercedes Benz CLA hybrid powertrain Mercedes says it has diesel levels of efficiency The new CLA will also be offered in hybrid form. Specifically designed to fit in the same space as the EV’s front motor, its powertrain pairs a new 1.5-litre four-cylinder petrol engine with a small, 1.3kWh battery and a 27hp electric motor. These combine to send either 136hp or 163hp through the front wheels or, in the range-topping 4Matic model, 191hp to all four wheels. Mercedes claims the new hybrid powertrain gives the CLA “diesel levels of fuel efficiency”. Mercedes CEO Ola Kallenius also announced that the hybrid will be priced at par with the EV in a push for greater parity between EVs and combustion models. Mercedes Benz CLA exterior design and aerodynamics CLA has a drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.21 The CLA EV’s impressive range figure is in no small part thanks to its aerodynamic design. Although the car is larger than its predecessor (25mm wider, 25mm taller and 30mm longer), much work went into minimising its frontal area, and smoothing the air flow around it. For example, the wheels are set further in-board of the arches than its predecessor. Small inlets on the front bumper (and corresponding outlets at the rear) guide the flow of air around each corner relatively undisturbed by the alloy wheels’ flush-faced designs. The efforts net a slippery drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.21, just behind that of the EQS (0.20). CLA EV and CLA hybrid share the same design Also, in a first for Mercedes, the CLA hybrid and CLA EV will look almost identical inside and out. The new CLA emphasises on the brand’s three-pointed star logo with its lighting elements. The motif features in the CLA’s headlights and brake lights, and the EV also gets a flush front grille with no fewer than 142 backlit stars. They surround the main front badge, which is also backlit. The CLA hybrid is differentiated by a traditional open grille, needed to provide cooling to the engine. Mercedes Benz CLA interior and features Superscreen setup continues in CLA Inside, the new CLA takes on a sportier character than its more luxurious stablemates. The front seats have chunky side bolsters, for example, and there are more exuberant material choices, such as a combination of black and white Alcantara and faux leather with red stitching. The dashboard is designed around the latest iteration of Mercedes’ Superscreen, whose three digital displays (a 10.25-inch one for the instruments in front of the driver; a 14.6-inch infotainment; and, optionally, a 14-inch one for the front passenger) span its entire width. New MB.OS operating system brings AI functions Thanks to Mercedes’ latest MB.OS operating system, the screens can be used to play video games or stream shows and films via Netflix and other such services. The system also features the latest iteration of Mercedes’ virtual assistant, which blends various artificial intelligence functions (ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Microsoft Bing) to provide more accurate answers to questions. In cars without the Superscreen, the passenger screen will be replaced with a glass panel with LED-backlit star logos, which match the interior’s ambient lighting. Boot space is rated at 405 litres. In a first for a modern Mercedes, the EV gets a frunk that adds another 101 litres of storage space. Mercedes Benz CLA launch details India launch expected by end of 2025 The CLA will first go on sale in its EV guise around October in Europe, with the hybrid following a few months later. Joining the sedan will be a new CLA estate with both powertrain options, and it is expected to be showcased around September at the Munich Motor Show. The CLA sedan is expected to arrive here in India by the end of 2025 as well. Also See: 2025 Defender Octa price announcement on March 26 New BMW iX3 design previewed by Neue Klasse X prototype",

    "description": "https://youtu.be/gF_VI4Ooafw Jean-Philippe Duval never finished school. In France, it was required until sixteen, but he got out early, walked into a trade school, and made a life out of something that felt natural. He had no desire to turn wrenches for unhappy customers. Bodywork was a slow-motion hell of sanding, priming, waiting, and repeating. The results were too far into the future. But upholstery, that was something else. It was immediate. It was hands-on. It was the kind of work where a set of dedicated hours could turn a mess into something finished, something precise, something beautiful. He started small, working on whatever came his way. Then a friend showed up with a 356. And another, becoming specialized before he even realized it. His wife asked him if he really thought there’d be enough of them left to keep going for twenty years. That was twenty-five years ago. What draws Jean to these cars isn’t just the shape or the nostalgia or even the materials he gets to work with. It is the simplicity. A Porsche 356 can be taken apart in a day. If you have the tools and the patience, you can strip it to a shell without specialized equipment or some super secret factory-only technique, or an expensive factory set of tools. The seats come out with a few bolts. The door panels pop off after a handful of screws. The headliner is a known process. It is stretched over bows and tensioned into place. It was a car made to be serviced, something that can’t be said for most sports cars built in the last few decades. Back when these interiors were first assembled, they were built to be used. Every stitch, every panel, every material choice was made with purpose. They were elegant but not indulgent, refined but never overdone. The first 356s were built in Gmünd, Austria, in a repurposed sawmill, and by the time production ramped up in Germany, the interiors were still an exercise in function over flair. Porsche outsourced much of the assembly, with coachbuilders like Reutter and Karmann handling the upholstery and bodywork. There was no hand-stitched leather, no excessive padding, no exotic materials. Seats were often covered in vinyl, with cloth or corduroy inserts. Everything was cut, sewn, and installed as quickly as possible, with patterns optimized for production, not perfection. Panels were backed with simple pressboard. Seams were glued and stapled in places unseen. A skilled German trimmer could knock out a full interior in a day. That’s what Jean is undoing, and then redoing every time he starts a new project. He pulls everything apart, studies the seams, notes where things held up and where they failed, then builds it all back again, piece by piece. He sources materials from Germany, cuts everything by hand, and stitches it together with the same attention to detail as the original craftsmen, except now there is more time to refine every piece.The patterns are the same, but the precision is more cared after. The materials are closer to what Porsche would have used if they had the time. Perhaps. The kind of people who bring their 356 to Jean-Philippe Duval understand this. They are not looking for restoration in the showroom sense. They want something that feels like it has always been there. No hard lines where new meets old. No traces of the work. Just an interior that fits the car’s story. When it is done, it looks like it never left.  Continue...",

    "link": "",
    "description": "This is one of those happy accident stories, where a Le Mans legend added to its rich legacy in the most unusual of circumstances. Over its 100-plus-year history, the 24 Hours of Le Mans has delivered plenty of shocking results, but few rival this one. Not only did it propel a sponsor into the limelight, but it also unexpectedly sparked a motorsport cultural movement that continues to resonate 30 years later. However, as is often the case with motorsport stories from this era, a central figure behind it all eventually ended up in jail. A New Era, A Crucial Loophole The early '90s marked a transitional period in endurance racing. With the World Sportscar Championship folding in 1992, the Automobile Club de l’Ouest (ACO), custodians of Le Mans, sought to redefine the competition landscape. The curtain had fallen on the Group C prototype era, ushering in a focus on GT-style racers. Icons like the Ferrari F40, McLaren F1, and domestic marvels such as the Bugatti EB110 and Venturi 600 LM became the new torchbearers.​ To populate the GT1 class, the ACO mandated the production of at least 25 road-going versions of each race car. Yet, nestled within the fine print was a provision allowing manufacturers to apply for homologation prior to actual production—a statement ripe for exploitation. Porsche, ever the opportunist, recognized the potential of this clause, or, more importantly, this loophole. Continue...",
