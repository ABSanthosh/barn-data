    "description": "Ever since it came out in 2022, the Hunter 350 has been a runaway success for Royal Enfield. And it's not hard to see why - it's a stylish, well built and reasonably affordable entry point into one of the most aspirational brands in our market. But that's not to say it was a perfect machine and it did have one significant flaw. Recently, Royal Enfield updated the Hunter with changes that kept customer feedback in mind. So, are the Hunter’s drawbacks a thing of the past now?  Royal Enfield Hunter 350 suspension and ride comfort - 8/10 New shocks offer noticeable improvement in ride comfort What was perhaps the biggest problem on the Hunter (and a number of recent Royal Enfield launches) - the stiff rear suspension. For 2025, the company has replaced the earlier model’s linear springs with these progressive units you see here. And in a word, the effect they've had on the ride quality is landmark!  New progressive springs have transfromed the Hunter's ride quality. Whether you're going over big potholes that have started appearing now that the monsoon is here or you're tackling high frequency recurring bumps like thickly painted rumble strips, this rear suspension keeps you reasonably comfortable. Do bear in mind, it's not suddenly become as thoroughly plush as a Classic 350 but the ride comfort on the Hunter is no longer the dealbreaker it once was.  The Hunter's ride quality is no longer the dealbreaker it once was. Even when you’re just sitting on a static bike, you can feel the suspension sagging a little, unlike the previous model. And when you’re tackling uneven patchwork, big potholes, jarring concrete and the myriad of road imperfections that Mumbai’s road infrastructure is littered with, you’re no longer wincing in pain while getting tossed out of the seat like on the older bike. The good news for existing Hunter owners is that you can retrofit these new shocks to an older bike and have this same level of comfort.   Royal Enfield Hunter 350 clutch effort - 9/10 New slip/assist clutch greatly reduces clutch effort, helpful in city traffic Another pain point on the earlier Hunter was its heavy clutch pull, especially inside staccato big city traffic. Royal Enfield has remedied this problem by giving the latest model a slip/assist clutch which has greatly reduced the effort needed to pull in the clutch lever. While it is much lighter (thankfully!) it still has a decent amount of feel. This is especially important because the new riders this bike is aimed at can be deterred by a heavy clutch pull. Slip/assist clutch greatly reduces effort needed to pull the clutch lever, helpful in long traffic jams. And another little cherry atop this cake is that this lighter clutch action will soon be common across RE’s 350cc lineup as they will all be updated with this same slip/assist clutch in the coming months.  More good news is that just like the new suspension units, you can also retrofit this slip/assist clutch to existing Royal Enfield 350cc models. It might not be cheap to do so, but if you spend a lot of time stuck in traffic, your left forearm will thank you for it.  Royal Enfield Hunter 350 ride and handling - 8/10 It's wonderfully agile yet never feels unstable  Aside from these two changes, the Hunter is mostly the same as it's always been although there are a few small updates that we’ll talk about further down. This is an accessible and fun machine, and even more so now with our few earlier complaints being addressed.  The Hunter is an agile machine but isn't overly reactive. The best way to describe the Hunter’s demeanour is to say that it is an agile yet surefooted and confidence inspiring machine but not an overly eager one. And that's okay because this is meant to be a relaxed roadster at the end of the day.  Royal Enfield Hunter 350 seating comfort - 9/10 Despite its small size, it is roomy for taller riders While it is a compact machine, it's not cramped even for larger riders although with a pillion onboard, it can get a little tight. The company tells us that the handlebar is now a little closer to the rider than before and the seat foam’s density has been reworked, although seat height remains the same at 790mm. The reason behind making these changes has been to improve rider comfort over longer stints in the saddle. Truth be told, the difference is minimal and it's something most riders aren’t likely to notice.  Despite its diminutive size, the Hunter can seat taller riders comfortably. And while it's not aimed at doing long stints in the saddle, you can take the Hunter on longer trips without too much hassle.One change that's sure to help on our unpredictable roads, especially when riding two up or with luggage is the added ground clearance (now up by 10mm to a total of 160mm) Royal Enfield has liberated by rerouting the exhaust piping.  Seat foam density is now revised for added comfort. Royal Enfield Hunter 350 engine sound and refinement - 9/10 Characterful, smooth and torquey, the RE 350cc motor is an absolute peach  One very compelling reason you'd want to take the Hunter on longer rides is that charming engine. It's torquey, smooth, characterful and has a lovely exhaust note to accompany you on your getaways. It remains unchanged with the same 20hp and 27Nm as before. While those numbers aren't spectacular, its the way the torque is delivered, the gentle thump at low speeds and how the motor is absolutely calm at 80-90kph with just a slight pulse through the touch points that makes you want to take the longer route to your destination.  The Hunter's exhaust note also sounds remarkably different to the other 350s and has more of a fast-paced beat to suit its demeanour than its more relaxed siblings.  Royal Enfield Hunter 350 headlight performance - 7/10 New LED headlight looks good but its performance is rather average The final change on the Hunter 350 is the LED headlight and this is the same unit that has come from the shared RE parts bin. The previous model’s halogen setup worked well at lighting up a dark road and this new LED headlight provides rather average illumination in comparison to it. That being said, from a purely visual standpoint, the LED suits the modern look of the Hunter more than the earlier bulb headlight. LED headlight looks good but illumination is adequate and is the same as almost every other RE. Royal Enfield Hunter 350 price and verdict - 9/10 Lot of changes for a small increase in price, its a properly compelling option now Summing up, the Hunter 350 is now a really sorted machine and the best part is that Royal Enfield has only increased the price by Rs 7,000 for the mid and top variants, while keeping the starting price the same as it was before. As before, the difference between the mid and top versions is only in the colour schemes. Meanwhile, the base bike has simpler switchgear, wire spoked wheels with tubed tyres and single-channel ABS owing to the rear drum brake. The Hunter is a stylish and well-built machine. With this update, most of the Hunter’s flaws have been ironed out and it's encouraging to see a big company like Royal Enfield address customer feedback so comprehensively. As it stands today, the Hunter is one of the most compelling options in its class and it will surely become an even bigger success for Royal Enfield.",

    "description": "The world of motorcycle jackets is flooded with options that scream, “I ride; therefore, I must look like I’m about to scrape knees or win the Dakar Rally.” Enter Rynox’s Downtown Pro Jacket, which promises the right riding chops but prefers to whisper about them in a coffee shop rather than shout over an exhaust note. Available only in Midnight Black, it is rather muted and minimalistic for a riding jacket and is aimed at the urban commuter. The jacket’s touch and feel are quite premium for the price, and it still manages to be fairly practical. The fit is quite snug, and I found that the sizing chart was quite accurate. The chest panel is made of knitted polyester with infused reflective fibre that glimmers under light. There’s even a little reflective detailing that’s subtle by day and life-saving by night. While this appears a tad odd and out of place at the start, with time, I’ve begun to like its look. Pockets large enough to fit a regular size phone The jacket packs two large external pockets, usable enough to fit most things you’d need to access on the go. The shell is created using heavy-duty 3D polyester mesh and reinforced dual-stitching on slide zones. It is worth noting that while this jacket is mostly made out of mesh, the heavy-duty construction means it weighs more than a traditional mesh/textile jacket and has slightly less ventilation. Rynox also hasn’t disclosed any ratings for the abrasion resistance. Adjusters don't get in the way of folding your arm and it is easy to fine-tune the fit. In terms of comfort, the Downtown Pro does well in India’s harsh climate. The excessive use of mesh makes this a fairly breathable jacket for most seasons. While overall ventilation is quite good, it’s only during peak summer in Mumbai that I found it a bit lacking and not on par with the more affordable Cypher GT jacket. That seems like a fair trade-off to me, given the classy design. The knitted rib material used on the wrist and waist feels a lot nicer and should save you from any chafing. It is a soft and elastic material that ensures quite a snug fit. However, the downside is you won’t be able to wear a watch under your cuff, leaving it on display while riding. The front facing reflectors are integrated quite smartly into the jacket There’s also a removable internal rain liner, and the outer shell has some decent water resistance, so you can get through a short drizzle without looking like you walked out of a swimming pool. As for safety, this jacket is generously equipped with CE level 2 armour by Cerros. You get armour for your shoulders, elbows and back, along with an optional chest armour set that is sold separately. The armour is flexible, breathable, and sits flush with the body, so you don’t appear like you’re hiding a turtle shell underneath. At just Rs 5,950, the Rynox Downtown Pro punches above its weight. It is well-equipped and ventilated without breaking the bank. What’s impressive is how all this protection is integrated without ruining the silhouette. It’s very much a “ride to work, ride to dinner” kind of jacket. If your commutes are short and your evenings spontaneous, the Downtown Pro Jacket offers a presentable and perfectly comfortable option. However, if functionality and ventilation are your priority, I’d save the extra Rs 1,000 and check out the Cypher GT instead. Also see: Raida Frigate jacket review",

    "description": "The premium electric vehicles (EV) space has really begun to heat up. While there weren’t any options between the Rs 25 lakh MG ZS EV and the Rs 1 crore Mercedes EQC earlier, now there are as many as six EVs priced around Rs 50 lakh on sale. Of these, the Hyundai Ioniq 5, the recently launched BYD Sealion 7 and the locally made BMW iX1 LWB appear to be the most compelling. We brought the three together and put them through our real-world tests to see which one deserves a spot in your garage. All three EVs measure over 4.6 metres in length, over 1.8 metres in width and have a 2.8-metre or longer wheelbase. The BYD is the longest and the widest, the BMW is the tallest, and the Hyundai trumps the other two in wheelbase length. As for their underpinnings, the BYD and Hyundai have born-electric platforms, which allow for better packaging and interior space. As such, these two feature a properly usable frunk (front trunk), which the ICE-to-EV converted BMW lacks.

The Ioniq 5 takes the shape of a large hatchback; the iX1 is more like a traditional SUV, while the Sealion 7 looks like a coupé-SUV. It really depends on which style you prefer, but all of them stand out in their own way with distinctive design elements. The Ioniq 5 has a neo-retro look with sharp cuts and creases and unique multi-spoke, dual-tone alloys, and I particularly like the rectangular lighting elements. In contrast, the Sealion 7 has a more rounded design that goes with BYD’s family look. It does look large and ungainly from the front, but the large alloys and the tapering roofline add some flair. At the rear, there’s a connected lighting element, which has some nice details. The BMW is the most conventional by far and has that upright stance of an SUV. It features BMW’s signature kidney grille, which appears a bit too large, as do the LED headlights. Its side profile does not look the most proportionate, thanks to the longer wheelbase and the smaller 18-inch wheels; the rear is quite similar to the standard X1, with large, L-shaped LED tail-lamps. BYD Sealion 7 vs Hyundai Ioniq 5 vs BMW iX1 LWB interior space and comfort The Sealion 7’s interior is superbly finished and loaded with tech, but the instrument cluster is cluttered. All three EVs have distinct identities inside the cabin as well. Starting with the Sealion 7, you’re greeted with a relatively conventional-looking dashboard, which houses the screens for the touchscreen infotainment system and the driver’s display. The 15.6-inch touchscreen, in typical BYD fashion, can change orientation from landscape to portrait, is very slick to operate, has high-res graphics, and even gets an updated UI over its siblings. This screen controls most of the car’s functions, but it’s nice that there are some physical controls in the centre console and a neat trick to adjust the AC without going into the sub-menus. All you have to do is swipe on the screen with three fingers from left to right for fan speed and from top to bottom for the temperature. Tinted glass at the back helps keep the Sealion 7 cool. The driver’s display, too, is high-res, but it appears very cluttered, and a lot of the important info appears small. But you have to commend BYD for the superb material quality and fit-and-finish, which feel on par with European luxury brands. The BYD's high-res 360-degree camera is one of the best. In the centre console, you get two wireless charging pads and two cup holders; there’s even some storage space below the console. The front seats feature ventilation, have just the right amount of cushioning and are very comfortable for occupants of all sizes. At the back, too, the seats feel plush and can be reclined; there’s loads of space, particularly legroom. The large windows and the glass roof elevate the sense of space. BYD’s 500-litre boot can fit in a lot. BYD has also packed the Sealion 7 with features like wireless smartphone integration, a 12-speaker Dynaudio music system, powered front seats, auto headlamps and wipers, a gesture-controlled and powered tailgate, dynamic ambient lighting, and much more. As for safety, there are 11 airbags, including one between the front seats and two for the rear side bolsters. There’s also Level 2 ADAS, a crisp 360-degree camera, and a driver-attention monitor, which is way too sensitive – even briefly glancing at the touchscreen generates a warning. The Sealion 7’s rear seat is big on space and feels the plushest. As for the new iX1 LWB, it has the same dash design as the ICE-powered X1 and the iX1 xDrive30, with a large, curved display that includes the infotainment touchscreen and the instrument panel. There are large, horizontal AC vents on the passenger side of the dash and under the screen, below which a sizeable wireless charging pad is located. The centre console extends from the centre armrest and houses some of the car’s key functions. The screens, while high in resolution, are too complicated tonavigate initially and on the go. While the fit and finish are great, some materials lower in the cabin are hard and scratchy. The steering is typically BMW with a chunky rim; the touchscreen has swallowed too many controls, and the UI is confusing. The front seats are supportive, but larger passengers may find them narrow, and they don’t have ventilation, which the other two EVs provide. The cushioning is firmer than the BYD’s. While the seats may not seem as comfortable initially, you’ll feel the cushioning is well-judged the longer you spend time in them. It’s at the rear where you get to experience the benefits of a long wheelbase. Though you are seated quite low and in a bit of a knees-up position because of the underfloor battery, you get acres of legroom; the seat base is longer by 15mm, and the backrest can be reclined up to 28.5 degrees, all of which make it more comfortable than the standard wheelbase version of the iX1. Compared to the BYD, though, the BMW feels narrower inside, and the backrest cushioning is on the firmer side. What also would’ve added to the comfort is rear sun blinds, which are also missing in the BYD. The iX1 has the most legroom but doesn’t get sunshades. The BMW is the least feature-rich EV here, but it still gets stuff like a large panoramic glass roof, ambient lighting, auto LED headlamps, connected tech, a smartphone-enabled key, leather upholstery, eight airbags and Level 2 ADAS tech. BMW’s 490-litre boot is the smallest here. Now, let’s come to the Hyundai Ioniq 5. Step inside it, and you get a great sense of space, thanks to the massive glass area, light colours, flat floor and the absence of a traditional centre console. Hyundai has used recycled and sustainable materials inside, and what’s great is that the fit and finish, as well as the touch and feel of bits, are top-notch. However, the white upholstery stains very easily, as you’d typically expect. The Hyundai's cabin is well-finished, logically laid out and big on practicality; UI is the easiest to use. Headlining the dash are two 12.3-inch screens – one for the instrument cluster and the other for the infotainment. These displays are crisp and easy to read, and the UI is easier to understand and navigate than that of the other two. The steering is a 2-spoke unit that houses a round drive-mode selector, while the drive-selector stalk is beneath the headlamp stalk. Uniquely, the entire centre console slides front and back to tailor the space and access. There are also plenty of storage spaces, such as a huge drawer in place of the glove box, large door bins and the centre console itself. The Ioniq 5's front seats are cooled, heated and get ottomans. The front seats are broad and supremely comfortable, with soft cushioning and plenty of electric adjustments, including extendable leg rests, and they can be configured into a comfy lounger. They also have ventilation and heating. The rear seats, though not as comfy as the ones in front, are easily wide enough for three adults, with the outer two seats featuring heating and electric adjustment. However, you are seated in a knees-up position due to the battery under the floor. The Hyundai's rear seats are wide enough for three, but you’re seated in a knees-up position. The Ioniq 5 also packs in a panoramic fixed glass roof, an 8-speaker Bose sound system, a 360-degree parking camera, dual-zone climate control, an electric boot, ESP, six airbags and ADAS. Wired smartphone integration is a downer, though.

The Sealion 7 has an all-wheel drive (there is also an RWD version), the Ioniq 5 is rear-wheel drive and, rather unconventionally, it’s the BMW that’s front-wheel drive. The BYD, in this dual-motor Performance guise, also has a clear advantage in terms of output (530hp/690Nm), followed by the Hyundai (217hp/350Nm) and the BMW (204hp/250Nm). And this is reflected in the performance figures. The Sealion 7 Performance makes the 0-100kph sprint in a brisk 4.43 seconds, compared to the Ioniq’s 7.48 seconds and the iX1’s 11.30 seconds. It’s the same story in rolling acceleration, with the BYD comfortably outperforming its rivals. Before we get into the nitty-gritty of how these feel like to drive, one thing each of them does admirably well is delivering power in a linear manner, unlike EVs of old, which served up all of their performance in one big chunk right from the get-go. All three also get drive modes, which affect throttle sensitivity, power delivery and range. Let’s start with the BYD, which easily feels the quickest of the lot. What’s nice is that it is able to put its power down in a tidy manner, thanks to the AWD system. On the move, you’ll also appreciate how smooth and progressive the power delivery is. And while the powertrain is silent, you will start to hear more of the outside world as you get closer to triple-digit speeds despite it featuring double-glazed front windows. Similarly, in the Hyundai, you don’t get that neck-snapping acceleration; the power delivery is nice and smooth. But that’s not to say that you’ll feel a lack of performance, as the Ioniq 5 feels sprightly in the Sport mode. The throttle modulation has also been judged very well, and it feels like a normal ICE car to drive. What’s also nice is that suspension, road and tyre noises barely disrupt the silence of the cabin. The BMW, by far, feels the most relaxed out of the trio, and while it packs over 200hp, given the weight it has to haul around, it can leave you wanting more, like when you want to make a quick overtake. As it has a front-wheel drive, there’s also some torque steer to contend with when driven flat out. As for sound insulation, it isn’t as quiet on the move as the Ioniq but fares better than the Sealion 7.

The Sealion 7 has an 82.56kWh unit with BYD’s blade cell LFP battery technology. The Ioniq 5 has the second-largest battery pack at 72.6kWh, and the BMW has the smallest at 66.4kWh; these two use the NMC battery chemistry. However, the Ioniq 5 has the highest claimed range of 631km, followed by the Sealion 7 (542km) and the iX1 (531km). In our real-world range test, the Ioniq 5 came out on top with a calculated overall range of 457km, significantly higher than the other two. The iX1 LWB had a 398km range, and given the extra power, the BYD delivered the least range of 371km. And, as is the case with most EVs, all three were more efficient in the city cycle, where they can recuperate more energy.  The move to the long wheelbase has come at the cost of some agility. All three get multiple regen braking modes, but the BMW has an advantage here with four modes; the Hyundai gets three, while the BYD has only two. One must note that the BMW also has an adaptive regen mode, but it’s not very intuitive, and the Hyundai is the only one in which you can turn off regen, allowing for free coasting. However, the BMW’s mode controls are baked into the touchscreen, making it tedious to change them on the move, and it’s also the most aggressive of the lot. On the other hand, the BYD feels the least aggressive, even in its ‘High’ mode. It’s the Hyundai’s regen that is best tuned, with a natural feel in the lower level, and you can even adjust levels or turn it off via paddle shifters. Also, the iX1 and the Ioniq 5 are capable of one-pedal driving. Despite huge 20-inch alloys, the ride is supple. The Ioniq 5 is the clear winner when it comes to charging speeds, as it is capable of DC fast charging at speeds of up to 350kW, which is enough to take it from 10 to 80 percent in just 18 minutes. The BYD can be charged up to 150kW on a DC fast charger. Both these are also capable of V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) and V2L (vehicle-to-load) functions, wherein they can charge other EVs and power/charge other devices. The BMW can be fast-charged up to 130kW. BYD Sealion 7 vs Hyundai Ioniq 5 vs BMW iX1 LWB ride comfort and handling As for ride and handling, the Sealion 7 has a hint of firmness to its ride, but it manages to deal with road imperfections fairly well. The 20-inch wheels on this AWD version are a fly in the ointment, making it feel crashy over bumps. Given its mass and high centre of gravity, the BYD rolls a fair bit around bends, and its steering feels a little too quick. Smaller 18-inch wheels help give it a cushy ride. The Ioniq 5 feels planted at all speeds, and you’ll like the maturity with which it drives. The steering is direct and has a good heft, but it doesn’t feel sporty to drive, which is fine given its focus on comfort. And despite sitting on those large 20-inch alloys, the ride feels comfy and well-damped, and the Ioniq 5 deals with the rough stuff fairly well. There are some minor vertical movements over expansion joints, but it feels well-controlled. Meanwhile, the long wheelbase has affected the BMW iX1’s handling just as you’d expect. It doesn’t feel as agile as the regular wheelbase, dual-motor iX1 xDrive30, but it still grips corners admirably well with little body roll to speak of. The ride quality, like in most BMWs lately, is excellent. It feels very absorbent and does a good job of making the iX1 feel composed over most surfaces. BYD Sealion 7 vs Hyundai Ioniq 5 vs BMW iX1 LWB price and verdict The iX1, which has BMW’s badge value to bank on, has plenty of space at the back and is very attractively priced at Rs 49 lakh; dynamically, it’s the best here. But it has its shortcomings – it isn’t as equipped as the others; the infotainment system is unnecessarily complex and has swallowed a lot of key functions; the rear-seat backrest cushioning is firm, and certain plastics lower in the cabin feel out of place on a BMW. Now let’s sum up the Sealion 7. It is BYD’s most rounded offering in India yet and has everything we love about the Seal sedan in a more practical package. The interior quality and fit-and-finish are top-notch; it’s got all the tech and features you need, a comfortable backseat, and the most powerful drivetrain that’s quite smooth. It’s also the only one here with all-wheel drive (Rs 54.90 lakh), though there’s an RWD version with a higher claimed range of 567km but a lower output (310hp, 380Nm) and a price tag of Rs 48.90 lakh, which is still more expensive than the Hyundai and with a lower promised range. The Sealion 7 loses ground in its real-world range, which is the lowest, and it isn’t as well-rounded in many specific matters – the sound levels inside the cabin are high, the ride isn’t as plush, and the driver’s display is cluttered. And then, there’s BYD’s relative lack of an aftersales network. And this brings us to the winner, the Hyundai Ioniq 5. It standsout as the most approachable and well-rounded package. The cabin is spacious, the seats are very comfy and unique, and the infotainment is easy to navigate. The Ioniq 5 is also the most natural to drive, has the best real-world range and can charge at the fastest pace. To top it off, it’s the most affordable, too, at Rs 46 lakh. It’s no wonder then that the Ioniq 5 won our Car of the Year 2024 award and this comparison, too.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/nio-firefly-confirmed-sale-europe-set-uk-october",
    "description": "New Renault 5 rival is being rolled out in seven new European markets and a right-hand-drive model is in the works The Nio Firefly, a Chinese rival for the Renault 5 and incoming Volkswagen ID 2, has been confirmed for Europe – and UK sales should soon follow. The electric supermini was launched in China in April, offering a range of 260 miles (albeit on the lenient CLTC test cycle) and a single rear-mounted 141bhp motor for the equivalent of around £12,500. Firefly was initially announced as a new brand, alongside Onvo, but the two were repositioned as sub-brands of Nio shortly after launch. Nio sold some 3680 examples of the Firefly in May, its first full month on sale, and it played a key role in boosting the brand’s overall sales for the month by 13.1% year on year. Although it has only been shown in left-hand-drive form so far, Nio president Qin Lihong said at the Shanghai motor show that the brand would launch a right-hand-drive variant for the UK by October. Although Nio has yet to announce specific plans for a UK launch, having last year told Autocar that it was “continuing its preparations for entry”, Lihong’s comment suggests one is imminent. Nio is currently in the process of a dramatic expansion across Europe, having pledged to enter 16 new global markets this year alone. It has now confirmed that seven of those will be European nations: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, Poland and Romania.  In addition to the Firefly, Nio will launch the EL6 and EL8 SUVs, ET5 saloon and ET5 Touring estate in those markets. It added that there will be “further news” for Europe in the coming weeks, suggesting an announcement could be inbound. Notably, Automotive News Europe (ANE) reported in late 2024 that Nio was preparing to launch its Onvo L60, a coupé-like Tesla Model Y rival, in the UK this year. Product planning boss Eric Yu told ANE that the UK’s lack of import tariffs on Chinese EVs was a key motivator; Nio's cars are currently subject to a 31% surcharge in the EU.",

    "description": "The new Leaf will be twinned with the next-generation Juke and built in Sunderland Nissan confirms full debut for new electric crossover in June ahead of production starting in Sunderland The new third-generation Nissan Leaf EV will be fully revealed later this month ahead of a market launch by the end of the year. In a new video showcasing some headline attributes, Nissan revealed new details and angles of the upcoming Skoda Elroq rival, which will enter production at Sunderland in the coming months. Nissan says that despite the new Leaf's substantially different shape and positioning, its development has been heavily informed by learnings from the Mk1 and Mk2 cars.  \"Leaf is an icon for us. It's one of our core 'heartbeat' models,\" said Nissan's global product strategy boss, Richard Candler. \"We've sold around 700,000 Leafs since 2010, with over 28 billion kilometres covered by our customers, so we have really substantial, real-world insight about the customer - understanding how their needs have evolved from the early days of Leaf until now.\" One significant improvement claimed by Nissan is in aerodynamic efficiency, with the rakish-roofed new Leaf touting a coefficient of just 0.25 in European trim - down from the Mk2's 0.28. Nissan is waiting until the official debut to confirm battery specifications, but that low coefficient will be instrumental in the Leaf achieving a claimed maximum range of 372 miles. Also confirmed is the option of an electrochromic dimming panoramic roof with heat shielding, which Nissan says negates the need for any physical blinds and thereby avoids compromising head room in the back.  The Leaf was launched in 2010 as one of the first mass-market electric cars and in its first two generations took a conventional hatchback form, but it has now undergone a major shift to cash in on the trend for higher-riding cars. It sits on the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance's CMF-EV platform, which is currently used by the larger Nissan Ariya EV and will be used by the forthcoming Nissan Juke EV.  While Nissan has yet to give any more technical details, European product boss François Bailly said the Leaf has been developed with an emphasis on “real-world range.” He added: “How long you can drive on a highway is key for us, which is why you see the beautiful shape with the aerodynamics. For us, it’s about practicality: how long will it take to drive 800km [497 miles], including the time to charge?” Nissan's global design boss, Alfonso Albaisa, said the new Leaf is “about democratising technology\", adding: \"It’s very modern, simple and nice. We wanted something tailored, handsome, well-proportioned, with a super-tech interior that feels open and cool.” Bailly added that the Leaf will get Nissan’s latest in-car systems, enabled by its updated Car and Connected Service (CCS) platform, which features a Google-based infotainment system and advanced driver assistance systems. He said: “It’s all the things that make your life easier. “We are confident we have something that is unique, and we’re really happy with this car.”",

It was an hour-long race that wound through the deep woods outside of the Barber Vintage Festival, and we were well into it. With cameras in hand, we tried to track each rider through the trees as they wrenched their throttles and battled for position in the narrow corridors. The sweet sound of vintage dirt bike motors resonated from every side of the course. Leaving this place became the last thing in our minds.…",

    "description": "The Ministry of Heavy Industries has finalised a new EV policy dubbed ‘Scheme to Promote Manufacturing of Electric Passenger Cars in India’ (SPMPCI), which reduces import duties on electric cars from 110 percent to just 15 percent. These tariff cuts have been formulated to attract global EV makers to India and incentivise local manufacturing of electric cars. Interested carmakers must invest Rs 4,150 crore and meet other criteria It will allow each of them to import 8,000 premium EVs annually at the concessional tax rate Carmakers like Volkswagen, Kia, Hyundai, Skoda, etc are interested in the policy EV import duty reduction policy explained Rs 4,150 crore investment mandatory To qualify for the slashed import duties under SPMPCI, approved carmakers must invest Rs 4,150 crore (approximately $500 million) within three years to ensure commitment to building EVs in India. Manufacturers will also be permitted to set up assembly operations in existing production plants, but prior investments and land/building costs shall be excluded from the initial investment amount. The duty reductions will last for a period of five years. Secondly, participating carmakers must achieve progressive annual turnover milestones: Rs 2,500 crore by the second year, Rs 5,000 crore by the fourth year, and Rs 7,500 crore by the fifth year. Within this time span, manufacturers must also open local production plants by the end of the third year and achieve 25 percent local value addition, which should be increased to 50 percent by the end of the fifth year. Quota of 8,000 units for tariff cuts The lower import duty will be applicable for up to 8,000 premium EVs (priced above USD 35,000) annually, beyond which the current 110 percent duty will be levied. Total savings from the tariff cuts are capped at either Rs. 6,484 crore or actual investment - whichever is lower - and unused yearly quotas can be carried forward as well. Additionally, the government has specified that expenditures like manufacturing equipment and machinery, research and development facilities, charging infrastructure (up to 5 percent of total investment), land and buildings (up to 10 percent of investment if part of main manufacturing facility) count towards the initial investment required. An online portal for SPMPCI submissions will soon be opened, with issuance of approval letters to compliant carmakers likely beginning from August 2025. Carmakers interested in EV import duty reductions Tesla not looking to manufacture EVs in India Tesla Model Y test mule in India. HD Kumaraswamy, the Minister of Heavy Industries, recently stated that carmakers like Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, Skoda, and Volkswagen have “formally” expressed interest in the SPMPCI policy. However, American EV maker Tesla is not among the companies interested in setting up manufacturing facilities here. Tesla is slated to enter the Indian market in 2025, and it seems all but confirmed that the company's offerings will attract the full 110 percent tariff upon launch. “Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Skoda, then Hyundai and Kia - all these companies have already shown interest formally. Tesla, we are not actually expecting from them. They are only to start showrooms, they are not interested in manufacturing in India, as per the information that is with us today,” said Kumaraswamy. The minister also revealed that SPMPCI applications will only be considered from carmakers that earn at least Rs 10,000 crore in annual revenue from automotive manufacturing and invest at least Rs 3,000 crore in assets globally.

    "description": "The Hyundai Alcazar has been updated with a new Corporate trim that finally brings a panoramic sunroof to the diesel range. Priced from Rs 17.87 lakh, the new Corporate trim is available with both manual and automatic gearboxes, and only in 7-seater guise. Hyundai has also made the DCT gearbox with the petrol engine a little more affordable by offering it on the second-from-base Prestige trim at Rs 18.64 lakh. Alcazar gets new Corporate diesel trim with panoramic sunroof Corporate trim is available only in 7-seater guise DCT gearbox with petrol now more affordable by 2.30 lakh Here’s a look at the prices of the new Hyundai Alcazar variants: Hyundai Alcazar new trims launched (prices, ex-showroom)Variant Price Alcazar Corporate Diesel 7-strRs 17.87 lakh Alcazar Corporate Diesel AT 7-strRs 19.29 lakh Alcazar Prestige Petrol DCT 7-str Rs 18.64 lakh Hyundai Alcazar Corporate: what’s new? So far, the Alcazar only came equipped with a panoramic sunroof on the petrol variants, available from the second-from-base Prestige trim. The diesel variants did not get a panoramic sunroof for two reasons – one, to keep pricing at par with the petrol and two, in the interest of fuel economy. Hyundai had managed to save about 50kgs on the Alcazar diesel by not offering the panoramic sunroof, and that helped achieve a fuel economy of over 20kpl, which is what customers value when buying a diesel. Alcazar diesel now gets a panoramic sunroof with new Corporate trim. However, it’s no secret how much Indian car buyers fancy a panoramic sunroof, which is why Hyundai seems to have given into the trend. The new Corporate trim sits between the existing Prestige and Platinum trims, and apart from the panoramic sunroof, it also comes equipped with LED headlamps, 17-inch alloys, dual-zone AC, ambient lighting, 10.25-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, wireless charger, 6 airbags and ESC. The Alcazar diesel uses a 1.5-litre mill that produces 116hp and 250Nm; the new Corporate trim is available with both 6-speed manual and 6-speed AT gearbox. Hyundai Alcazar new petrol-DCT variant launched Meanwhile, the new Prestige petrol-DCT variant makes the 7-speed DCT gearbox more affordable by 2.30 lakh; previously it was offered on the Platinum trim onwards, which is priced from Rs 20.94 lakh. The DCT gearbox is mated to the 1.5-litre turbo-petrol engine that produces 160hp and 253Nm of torque.
