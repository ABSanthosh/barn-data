    "description": "Compare with Saturday night, Sunday morning at Le Mans is a different world Common logic holds that the Le Mans 24 Hours is at its most magical at night. And sure, it’s incredible watching hypercars blast past in the dark at close to 200mph – but the rest of it can be a bit much. On Saturday night, the Circuit de la Sarthe morphs into a big party venue, and it can be an overwhelming sensory experience. The humidity that can build over Le Mans in mid-June clings on after nightfall, making it stifling and uncomfortable. And there’s a mass of humanity everywhere, drinking, partying and swirling in and out of the spectator zones, funfair and campsites. With all this and the bright lights, loud noises and smells of various foods being cooked, it’s loud, bustling and boisterous. For someone who isn’t much of a partying type, it’s a lot, and I’m always relieved to escape the mayhem. Besides, there’s a much better time to enjoy Le Mans. You just need to get up early: because compared with Saturday night, Sunday morning at Le Mans is a different world – and, in my mind, an immeasurably better, more pleasurable one. The humidity fades overnight, and as the sun breaks under clear skies, it’s usually fresh and welcoming. And, aside from the 50-plus high-powered race cars roaring round, it’s peaceful. The throngs of fans have melted away, aside from a handful of fellow early starters (and the odd late-night reveller asleep on the ground), so you have your run of prime spectator spots. And the spectating is amazing. On Saturday night the race is essentially the backdrop to a huge party, but on Sunday morning it regains centre stage. It’s a time for purists. By this stage, the ‘story’ of the race has been established, so you know which cars to keep an eye on and which gaps to monitor. Cool temperatures mean fast lap times, and even if the race has settled down, it’s far too early for anyone to back off. You can study each driver’s lines, listen to the differences in engine notes and appreciate the striking difference in performance between the classes. It’s also a great time to realise just how tough this race is. By dawn on Sunday, the cars are approaching two-thirds distance, so there are ‘only’ nine or 10 hours left. That doesn’t sound much in the context of a 24-hour race, but that’s still five grands prix. That’s when you appreciate how challenging a 24-hour race is and what an experience it is to witness – especially in a calm, quiet moment of solitude. In a few hours, the temperature will ramp up, the spectator areas will start to fill in readiness for the finish and Le Mans will start to feel like one of the world’s great mass spectator events again. My tip: get up early and enjoy the calm while you can.",

Niko is a three-time French FFM flat track champion, holds gold and silver medals from the German Krowdrace series, and finished third in the Italian FMI Cup. A dirt racer at heart, his motto is “Go fast, turn left, * brakes.” “Niko represents many things: a rider to admire on the track, a pain-in-the-neck client who’s always got something new to ask, but above all, a true friend,” beams Massimo. “Someone who feels like family, like a brother.” The bike that introduced Niko to the sport of flat track racing all those years ago was this humble Honda NX650 Dominator.…",

    "description": "Pepo Rosell, better known as XTR Pepo, is a force of nature. He originally burst onto the scene with his specialist custom workshop, Radical Ducati, before taking a break and relaunching as a solo act. Often inspired by classic endurance racers, Pepo’s bikes convey a sense of speed—with a hint of eccentricity. Pepo’s portfolio is dripping with exotic twin-cylinder Italian machines, but he’s just as adept at applying his talents to smaller bikes. He’s just buttoned up this Royal Enfield Guerrilla 450, and it’s every bit as radical as you’d expect an XTR Pepo motorcycle to be. In stock form, the Guerrilla 450 is a peppy single-cylinder roadster with a look that deviates from the Indian marque’s traditional aesthetic. But in the hands of Pepo, it’s a feisty supermono racer with tons of attitude.…",

    "description": "Yamaha’s FZ family has been around long enough to earn the “old guard” tag in the 150cc space. It’s the motorcycle that brought muscle to the masses when it first launched and has since become a go-to for smooth, reliable everyday riding along with big-bike looks. Over the years, the bike has received numerous updates, and the latest one brings in some interesting new features. Enter the FZ-S Fi Hybrid, a variant that doesn’t promise earth-shattering performance, but what it does offer is more efficiency and a big step up in tech and features. The big question, though, is this: does the hybrid tech make a difference, or is it just a buzzword? Yamaha FZ-S Fi Hybrid design and features (8/10) Muscular design with added TFT, Bluetooth, and hybrid tech Visually, Yamaha has played it safe, and there are no major design changes apart from some new colours and refreshed indicators. This is still unmistakably an FZ, and it continues to have that muscular streetfighter stance that made it so popular in the first place. Build quality is mostly very good, which is typical of Yamaha. A noticeable gap between the seat and the tank However, what caught my attention was a noticeable gap between the seat and the tank that effectively gives you a peep at the cylinder head. This Fi Hybrid variant is also available in an exclusive shade of grey and blue. The new colours, a touch of blue on the engine case, new switchgear and a brand-new TFT are the only ways to differentiate it.  Feature-packed TFT with good legibility is a boon The new 4.2-inch full-colour TFT display is a big step up from the drab LCD units we’re used to in this segment. It’s crisp and well laid out and offers Bluetooth connectivity through Yamaha’s Y-Connect app. The features list includes turn-by-turn navigation, call/SMS alerts, phone battery status, last parking location, and even malfunction notifications. It’s more tech than most 150cc buyers expect, and that’s a good thing.  New switchgear is well-finished but isn’t too tactile The LED headlamp does a decent job with illumination and is reliable for any late-night commutes. While single-channel ABS is standard, Yamaha has even thrown in traction control, which, with this amount of power, feels about as necessary as a raincoat in a desert. You’d have to ride through an oil spill to get it to kick in, and while it is a nice thing to have, dual-channel ABS would have been a more valuable safety feature. Yamaha FZ-S Fi Hybrid position and comfort (9/10) It has a relaxed, upright seating position with a spacious, well-padded seat Swing a leg over, and you’ll find that Yamaha gives you a commanding yet relaxed posture, which is ideal for city commutes and short highway stints. The seat is flat, spacious and adequately padded for both the rider and the pillion. At 790mm, its height remains accessible for most riders, and the bike’s 138kg kerb weight means it’s easy to manoeuvre in tight traffic. Add to that a well-judged footpeg position, and what you get is a very accommodating rider’s triangle for daily riding, with a hint of sportiness thrown in. Yamaha FZ-S Fi Hybrid performance and refinement (8/10) Refined and smooth in the city, but performance feels more 125cc than 150cc The 149cc air-cooled SOHC engine makes 12.4hp and 13.3Nm; on paper, it’s the same as the regular FZ-S. But the big news here is the Smart Motor Generator (SMG), which supports the crankshaft by delivering assistance at low RPMs. This system is similar to what you’ll find in the likes of the TVS Jupiter, but it’s hard to feel the system at work in the Yamaha.  Our performance tests also show very similar figures to the older model, so it’s safe to assume that there are no real performance gains here. What has improved is the fuel efficiency, but how much of that is down to the hybrid tech and how much is thanks to the new start/stop system is unclear. What we can say for certain is that the start/stop system works well and is one of the best we’ve experienced so far. It restarts quickly and silently when you pull in the clutch, even if you accidentally stall the engine, which is a slick little party trick. Out on the road, the motor is quite refined and tractable, with barely any vibration even at higher revs. The power delivery is rather linear, and the motor will happily pick up from 30kph in 5th gear. The performance is decent till about 80kph, but anything beyond that feels strenuous. Overall, it feels closer to a quick 125cc bike than a 150cc or 160cc one, and while the FZ is effortless to ride, it certainly isn’t exciting.  Yamaha FZ-S Fi Hybrid ride comfort and handling (7/10) Well-balanced in the city, but its firm suspension compromises comfort over rough roads The chassis is unchanged, and that’s not a bad thing – mostly. The steering is light, the turning radius is tight, and the bike feels nicely balanced in the city. The suspension setup has a firm edge to it, which results in decent handling but comes as a compromise in city comfort. For a motorcycle whose engine has evolved in the direction of being a city commuter, the suspension should have become a bit softer as well. High-speed stability is decent, though this isn’t a bike that eggs you on to carve corners. Braking duties are handled by discs at both ends, and while the bite isn’t razor-sharp, it’s progressive and confidence-inspiring.  Yamaha FZ-S Fi Hybrid price and verdict (8/10) Tech-loaded, fuel-efficient commuter that feels overpriced for the performance it offers At Rs 1.45 lakh, the FZ-S Fi Hybrid costs about Rs 10,000 more than the standard FZ-S. While you get better efficiency and a TFT screen with Bluetooth, this bike is priced higher than the top versions of the Bajaj Pulsar N160 and TVS Apache RTR 160 4V. Those motorcycles offer vastly better performance, upside-down forks and dual-channel ABS. What Yamaha has created here is a good-looking city commuter that brings premium features and better fuel economy. But that comes at a steep price, and if you couldn’t care less about the TFT and don’t mind being your own stop/start system, you won’t be missing out by settling for a more affordable variant from the FZ line-up.  Also see: 2025 Royal Enfield Hunter 350 review: Meaningful changes",

You see, amidst stringent emissions regulations, the new M5 has managed to hold on to the V8 engine thanks to a plug-in hybrid setup. While the new M5 is a lot more powerful than its predecessor, it’s also far heavier. Oh, and it’s got all-wheel drive too. 2025 BMW M5 powertrain and performance Twin-turbo V8, plug-in hybrid setup BMW M5 specificationsFuel typePetrol-hybridEngine4395cc, twin-turbo V8 petrolPower585hp at 5600-6500rpmTorque750Nm at 1800-5400rpmBattery18.6kWhElectric motor power197hpElectric motor torque280NmCombined power727hpGearbox8-speed torque converter automaticTyres (front)285/40 R20Tyres (rear)295/35 R21Kerb weight2435kgGround clearance115mm It was clear that if the M5 had to continue with the 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 under the bonnet and still do its diligence to Mother Nature, it would need some form of electrification. Enter the plug-in hybrid, which provides a claimed 67km of all-electric range. It also gives the 585hp engine an additional 197hp from an 18.6kWh battery pack. The combined output stands at a healthy 727hp and 1,000Nm. V8, hybrid and AWD all add up to a lot of weight. Expectedly, with the motor’s instant response and the power of the mighty V8, the new M5 is rapid off the line. It simply shoots off and continues to pull well past hysterical speeds. 0-100kph in 3.5 seconds might be slower than the previous version, but 0-200kph in under 11 seconds is very quick. Opt for the M Driver’s Pack, and the top speed jumps from 250kph to 305kph. As soon as it gets a straight road, it’s as excited to unleash its 1,000Nm as a dog is on the beach. However, while the numbers are strong, the M5 has always been more about the experience behind the wheel. Yes, the acceleration is impressive, but the sensation of speed just isn’t there. It also gets a ‘Boost’ mode, which lends a push under acceleration. Still, the abundance of foam and leather cocoons you, and the hushed cabin feels unfazed by the blur on the outside. Sure, the exhaust sound that is piped in through the speakers adds some drama, but none of it feels raw or unhinged. 2025 BMW M5 ride comfort and handling Heavy kerb weight can be felt in the corners Get to the long and flowing corners of CoASTT, and the elephant in the room starts to make its presence felt. The 2.5-tonne kerb weight is too much to hide. Yes, BMW has done its best to keep the weight in the centre and low to the ground with the floor-mounted battery pack, but it’s not enough, especially when it comes to a change of direction. There is constant understeer, and despite getting the tyres up to temperature, they just scream in despair as the AWD system tries to find grip on every inch of tarmac.   No fun if you are into attacking corners. You can try and find the sweet spot by tinkering around in the drive mode settings menu, which is nothing short of a Pandora’s box. You can either get it way too wrong or hit the jackpot. Either way, it will take time. With settings that can be altered for throttle response, steering feedback, chassis setup, brake feedback and dampers – before you even get to the hybrid modes – it is far too overwhelming. You’d expect BMW to provide a ready-made car like the M340i, where it sticks to one basic character, and you can fine-tune a few settings to a limit. But with the M5, it’s to each his own. Vast setup needs a lot of trial and error. It can be an altogether different beast, depending on the buttons you press. In the event you do find the right setup, there are two red buttons tagged ‘M1’ and ‘M2’ that act as preset switches, so you don’t have to spend hours calibrating the setup again. However, if lap times aren’t your priority, there is the option to switch to 2WD, which sends power exclusively to the rear wheels for some sideways action and tyre smoke. Sure, it needs confidence to push the rear out on a 727hp rear-wheel-drive car, but, if done correctly, it makes for a fantastic Instagram post. Also worth praising are the carbon-ceramic brakes, which have the toughest job here – stopping this very quick woolly mammoth. The brake feel is natural, and the strong bite means you don’t need to worry about a tired ankle after a track day. It gets all the cutting-edge tech to master a racetrack but feels at home on highways. So, it’s clear that on a race track, the new M5 is not particularly fun. It is better suited for long highway straights. In Comfort, the suspension is tamer, too, and broken roads are dealt with impressively. There is body movement over highway undulations, but nothing that can be termed unsettling. The car remains flat at cruising speeds and is surprisingly comfortable. The steering can be set up for lightness, the gearbox for lenient shifting, and the throttle for a less aggressive approach. What further helps its daily manners is the plug-in hybrid system, with approximately 50km of real-world electric range on a full charge. It may not sound like a lot, but any saving of high-octane fuel is always welcome. Expect about 50km of all-electric driving range. Don’t think you’re missing out on the speed, though. Even in electric mode, the top speed is 140kph, so as long as there is charge, the M5-ness is there. At low city speeds, the one thing you need to be wary of is the speed bumps. With no ride height adjust, there isn’t much you can do to tackle some poorly constructed breakers, and you have to crab-crawl like a supercar. Still, it feels more at home and comfortable outside of a racetrack. You have the instant acceleration for quick gaps, the drama with the exhaust that will get all the metropolitan attention, and plenty of features to keep you busy while at a standstill. 2025 BMW M5 exterior design Less of a 'sleeper' than prior M5s In the past, the M5 has mastered the art of being a ‘sleeper car’ – an unassuming, discreet design that packs a surprise under the bonnet. But with each generation, the subtle approach has taken a back seat. Speed bumps need to be dealt with caution, but it is better than an i5. The new one shows off aggression with flared wheel arches, aggressive bumpers, and a matte black paint that is nonchalant yet gets enough second looks. 20-inch front wheels and 21-inch rear wheels further elevate the drama, and if nothing else, a simple exhaust upgrade will have people take notice. 2025 BMW M5 interior and features 14.9-inch infotainment system, 12.3-inch digital driver's display Inside, the M5 gets BMW’s minimalistic layout with a curved display. The 12.3-inch cluster and 14.9-inch touchscreen are crisp and responsive, but the minimalistic dashboard has resulted in a chaotic iDrive system. Everything from the HVAC to media and the drive modes are buried under menus and sub-menus, and while there are shortcuts and widgets, it just isn’t natural or intuitive. Funky dashboard with generous use of crystal and ambient lighting. Feels racy yet luxurious. The chunky steering wheel feels great to hold, and the seats are superbly accommodating – sporty but broad, with lots of adjustability and well-cushioned. Long drives are what this M5 yearns for. For all the cutting-edge tech underneath to help it out at the Nürburgring, it feels like it would be happiest on the Autobahn. Rear seat space is inevitably of lower priority, but despite being the standard wheelbase (unlike the long-wheelbase regular 5 Series), there is plenty of room on offer. Being chauffeured around in electric mode from Monday to Friday sounds like a good idea, so long as you are okay handing your chauffeur the keys to your 727hp supersedan. Don't look up to pray. No sunroof here. Boot space is impressive too, so that weekend escape to the farmhouse can definitely happen, and it will be rapid and comfortable. Just engage Comfort mode, amp up the 18-speaker Bowers and Wilkins system, and blast off. 2025 BMW M5 price and verdict Rivals the Porsche Panamera GTS and upcoming Mercedes-AMG E 63 At Rs 1.99 crore (ex-showroom, India), the M5 has some stiff competition. The closest of the lot is the Porsche Panamera GTS, which is also a four-door super-sedan with a V8 engine. The new Mercedes-AMG E 63 will soon set foot on our shores, but in the past, the competition was never a major threat to the M5. With this new one, though, things don’t seem as easy. The M5's competitors are much stronger this time round. It’s not as exciting as the last one when it comes to driving dynamics. Making some amends is the outstanding straight-line speed and the fact that it is a comfortable daily driver. If you’ve driven the previous F90 M5, the excitement is missing, and this one will not impress you as much. However, if you’re getting into one with no M5 baggage, the new-gen M5, with its V8 intact, will do enough to have you smiling.

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/2025-vinfast-vf7-review-350hp-awd-ev-with-a-spacious-back-seat-435668#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Car+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "The first product from Vietnamese EV maker Vinfast to be assembled and sold in India will be the VF7. The brand, which has a wide range of products positioned both above and below the VF7, has chosen this as the debut model for India as it wanted to enter a competitive segment, while also playing its premium card first. Some brief time with the model at Vinfast’s factory testing track in Hai Phong, Vietnam, gave us a better idea of how it could be positioned in our market, and suffice it to say, there’s more to it than first meets the eye. 2025 Vinfast VF7 exterior design and engineering – 7/10 Full of interesting details, but estate-like form factor lacks presence. A design signature of all Vinfast models is the moustache-like ‘V Face’ LED DRL band that sits on the nose and dips in the centre underneath the brand’s logo. Viewed head on, this does make many of their models look similar to one another, particularly this and the VF6, but look closer and you’ll see unique touches in each of them. V-face LED DRL band is the signature element bringing a family look to Vinfast EVs. The VF7 gets a pair of brushed metal ‘blades’ in the front air dam, while the bumper itself has an indented or concave look. In fact, this muscular surfacing can be found all over the car, and on the side, flush door handles help give the sculpted doors a clean look. For India, the VF7 will get 19-inch wheels, and ground clearance has been raised to 190mm. Only when viewed in profile do you realise this is a 4.5-metre-long vehicle with a 2.8-metre wheelbase, though the front and rear overhangs are quite short. Vertically oriented tail-lamps with interesting details look attractive. At the rear, there’s more sculpture to the tailgate, a slim windscreen and attractive vertically oriented LED tail-lamps. While the details are excellent, its long and low-slung shape means it doesn’t quite have the road presence of a boxy SUV, or even the coupe-like look of its smaller sibling the VF6, which could work against it in India, where a more traditional form factor is generally preferred. 2025 Vinfast VF7 interior space and comfort – 8/10 Big on rear seat and boot space, quality generally good too. While it might not look large on the road, it certainly is on the inside. Under the powered tailgate you’ll find a capacious 537-litre boot, although there is no spare tyre. Rear seat space should endear it to chauffeur-driven owners, because both leg and head room are vast. Due to the high floor, you’re sat a bit knees-up, but you don’t feel it as much when you’re stretched out. Rear seat leg and head room are both vast; gets a reclining feature, too.  Speaking of which, new for the Indian model is the ability to recline the rear seat back a generous amount, and the cushioning is soft and supportive, especially for the lower back. The windows are long but slim and set quite high, although the sense of space is greatly enhanced by the huge fixed glass roof that stretches from edge to edge. Interior is clean and uncluttered; infotainment screen is angled towards driver. Up front, the VF7 replaces the traditional instrument cluster with a heads-up display (plus essential info as a permanent fixture in the touchscreen) to give an uninhibited view over the low-set dashboard. The 12.9-inch touchscreen takes pride of place, angled proud of the dash with a set of drive-select toggle switches below it. This, combined with the light-coloured, soft-touch vegan leather trimming the dash and doors gives it a unique and premium look, albeit one without much flash value. Fit and finish are good, although some dull and basic looking plastics are a distraction. Soft-touch vegan leather trimming on dashboard gives a premium feel.    2025 Vinfast VF7 features and safety – 9/10 Loaded with features and targeting a 5 star Bharat NCAP score. Vinfast has chosen to only launch a single fully loaded trim level called Plus, in India, as a competitive feature set was deemed a high priority. Features like the aforementioned rear-seat recline, a wireless phone charger, vegan leather, ventilated seats and one-litre bottle holders in each door were said to be non-negotiables. Seven airbags are also standard, as are a host of electronic safety aids, including a radar-based ADAS suite with Level 2 Autonomous driving, all in the quest, Vinfast says, to achieve a 5-star Bharat NCAP rating. Other feature highlights include dual-zone climate control and the big glass roof. Small icons and graphics on the screen make it difficult to use on the move. While there are a few physical controls in the centre console and on the steering wheel, most functions are relegated to the touchscreen. Though this is a common practice these days, what makes Vinfast’s system less than ideal is the small size of the icons and graphics on the screen, which are difficult to target while on the move. 2025 Vinfast VF7 range and efficiency – 6/10 Large battery holds promise, but low WLTP rating is a concern. While there is only one trim level and one battery size for the VF7, it will be offered with two powertrain options – single-motor FWD and dual-motor AWD. The battery is a 70.8kWh LFP unit which can be charged at up to 7.2kW on an AC charger or on a CCS2 DC charger, although speeds and times were not specified for the latter. European-spec VF7 has a maximum WLTP-certified range of 450km. Vinfast says the Indian-spec car has had some tweaks to its powertrain and thus it’s best to wait for official MIDC or ARAI range figures. However, the WLTP rating for overseas models is rated at 450km for the FWD model and 431km for the AWD model. 2025 Vinfast VF7 performance and refinement – 9/10 AWD version offers addictive acceleration, modes alter character well. Vinfast VF7 specificationsLxWxH4545mm x 1890mm x 1635.75mmWheelbase 2840mmBattery capacity70.8kWhDrive layoutFWD/AWDMotor power204hp/350hpMotor torque 310Nm/500NmKerb weight 2090kg/2205kg0-100kph 9.5sec/5.8secAC charging Up to 7.2kWWheel size 245/50 R19 The Vinfast VF7 FWD model uses the same 204hp, 310Nm front-mounted motor as the VF6, which is claimed to get it to 100kph from a standstill in 9.5 seconds. However, the version we got to sample was the dual-motor version, which adds another similar motor on the rear axle. Total outputs for this version are 350hp and 500Nm, which shreds the 0-100kph sprint down to just 5.8sec. In practice, it feels genuinely fast, even spinning up its wheels under hard acceleration from low speeds. The ferocity of the power delivery starts to taper off close to about 120kph, but it will hold those speeds with ease. The good news is that it is civilised and manageable at low speeds, making it suitable for city driving too. The VF7 is genuinely fast, even spinning up its wheels under hard acceleration. Refinement was hard to judge on the relatively smooth expanse of Vinfast’s test track but the requisite electronic whine in the cabin was a welcome indicator of the power being deployed. The brakes felt strong and confidence inspiring, and the VF7 AWD’s not-inconsiderable 2.2-tonne mass was kept well in check. 2025 Vinfast VF7 ride comfort and handling – 8/10 Feels solid and confidence inspiring at high speeds. The dynamic capabilities of the VF7 were also hard to ascertain on the smooth track with almost no corners present. However, the general sense was of a secure and planted vehicle in the vein of what we’ve come to expect from European cars. The choice to move down a size from 20-inch to 19-inch wheels and tyres (Apollo tyres, no less) seems to have been the right one, as there is a degree of absorption that perhaps would have been lacking with the upsize. It feels secure and planted at high-speeds, almost European-like.  The longer wheelbase of the VF7 appeared to give it a greater sense of stability at high speeds than the VF6, if perhaps robbing it of a bit of handling playfulness in the process. That said, the drive modes did well to add (or remove) steering weight for the desired driving conditions. 2025 Vinfast VF7 price and verdict – 8/10 If priced aggressively, it could be a unique proposition in India. While the Vinfast VF7’s estate-like form factor might not be to everyone’s tastes, those seeking substance over style will appreciate it. The rear seat and boot are incredibly spacious, making this a great car for families or the chauffeur driven. Plus there’s the AWD version for those who like the occasional hit of performance on their Sunday drive. With local assembly from the get go, Vinfast is expected to go aggressive with the price, and we expect it to be in the region of Rs 25 lakh (ex-showroom) for the FWD version, going up to about Rs 29 lakh for the dual-motor AWD version. With the features and safety kit on offer, that should make it very competitive. Upon launch, prices are expected to range between Rs 25 lakh-29 lakh (ex-showroom). Whether in look, spec or character, the VF7 is a unique proposition for the Indian market, and perhaps that’s exactly what new entrant Vinfast needs to make people sit up and take notice. We’ll know more when the VF7 (followed closely by the VF6) goes on sale in India in the festive season of 2025.

    "description": "Mahindra is planning to add hybrid powertrains to its current model portfolio, and, interestingly, the Indian automaker is looking at hybridisation of both its ICE and born EV platforms. A while ago, the company had said that it saw only EVs as the future, but with interest in hybrids steadily rising, it had subsequently decided to explore electrified ICE powertrains. The EV growth rate, too, has been slower than expected and with substantial effort and expense put into its BEV range, it's not surprising to see Mahindra considering hybrid powerplants for them too. Mahindra is considering both strong and range-extender hybrid powertrains The brand's current lineup comprises ICE and EV models In May 2025, Mahindra sold 2,604 EVs, with the bulk of the volumes coming from its born-electric lineup. While the figures mark steady progress, the brand is aiming higher with a 5,000-unit monthly sales target, now supported by the addition of hybrid alternatives. Mahindra hybrid details Range-extender hybrid powertrain under consideration We reported on Mahindra's hybrid plans in the June 2025 issue of Autocar India magazine. It's understood that for its ICE models, Mahindra is looking at a regular series-hybrid setup, whereas its BEV lineup is likely to get a range-extender hybrid powertrain. In this setup, a 1.2-litre petrol engine will function solely as a generator to recharge the battery, which in turn will power the electric motors that drive the wheels. Interestingly, even Maruti is developing an in-house and affordable range-extender powertrain for models like the Fronx, Baleno, Swift, and a small MPV. Also see: Mild, strong and plug in hybrid tech explained Mahindra XUV 3XO hybrid also in the works Strong hybrid system paired with 1.2-litre turbo petrol engine In January 2025, we had exclusively reported that the homegrown automaker is studying a hybrid system for its XUV 3XO compact SUV. But unlike the range-extender arrangement on the Mahindra BEVs, the XUV 3XO will make use of a series-parallel hybrid system. Sources in the know revealed that its existing 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, turbo-petrol engine will be paired with a strong hybrid system. Here, the combustion engine and electric motor can work together or independently, with the setup automatically deciding which to use, helping to leverage high fuel efficiency figures. Hybrid, EV sales in India outlook Grand Vitara, Urban Cruiser Hyryder most-selling hybrid models  With a total of 85,000 units sold last year, hybrids accounted for a 2.1 percent market share in the passenger vehicle category. Electric vehicles, which were subject to a slower-than-expected pace of adoption and the sustained challenge surrounding charging infrastructure, with sales of over 90,000 units secured a slightly higher 2.4 percent market share. In April 2025 alone, 8,754 hybrid cars and SUVs were sold in India, with the Maruti Grand Vitara and Toyota Urban Cruiser Hyryder accounting for an overwhelming 99 percent of these sales. A key driver of this growth is the government's recent push for hybrid adoption, including road tax exemptions on par with EVs in some states (see below). It's becoming increasingly clear that the shift to full electrification won't happen as quickly as expected, in India or globally. Here, despite EV penetration crossing 4 percent for the first time last month, the government's ambitious 30 percent target by 2030 remains a long way off. Even the EU is reconsidering its 2035 zero-emissions deadline, while in North America, Donald Trump’s pro-oil stance hints at continued reliance on ICE vehicles. Hyundai, Skoda-VW and JSW-MG hybrids coming as well Additionally, our recent scoop revealed that Hyundai is bringing the Pallisade hybrid SUV here. Skoda Auto Volkswagen, and JSW MG Motor also plan to introduce hybrid models down the line.

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/industry/rare-earth-supply-puts-indian-car-production-on-notice-435720#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+News+feed",
    "description": "Introduced in April as a tit-for-tat response to US tariffs, China’s clampdown on the export of rare earth minerals is threatening to deliver a crippling blow to global car production, including in India. With shipments of nearly 2,850 tonnes, India was estimated to be the fifth-largest importer of rare earth permanent magnets and magnet alloys from China last year. Rare-earth magnets, due to their small sizes and higher efficiencies, are widely used in EV powertrains and in systems across the auto industry, as well as in the production of smartphones, aerospace and other sectors. Over the years, China has monopolised the rare-earth supply chain and today controls 60 percent of the production and around 90 percent of global refining capacity. Chokehold China has not completely stopped these magnet exports. However, import approvals are now subject to a complex procedure mandating an end-use declaration confirming the magnets will not be used for military purposes, along with certifications from multiple Indian ministries and the Chinese embassy, as well as the final export clearance from Chinese authorities. “We first need endorsements from the DGFT (Directorate General of Foreign Trade) under the Ministry of Commerce, then the Ministry of External Affairs. These are then submitted to the Chinese embassy for an endorsement or token number, which is shared with the supplier or exporter in China, who forwards it to their provincial government. After provincial approval, it goes to China’s commerce ministry, which ultimately decides whether to grant the licence,” said a senior industry executive from the auto components industry. Industry red flags Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor have already warned of potential production disruptions. “As we speak, supplies and stocks are getting depleted, and if there are no shipments, July production will get seriously impaired,” Bajaj Auto’s executive director Rakesh Sharma said recently. A Reuters report said auto industry manufacturers told government officials last month that production could stall within days. Incidentally, the impact could extend beyond EVs to internal combustion engine (ICE) cars as well since these magnets are used in various components such as the engine, sensors, steering assemblies and speakers. The government is now planning to send a team of automotive leaders to China to discuss the restoration of supplies. “We are trying to send a delegation; probably in another 2-3 weeks, they will go,” the minister of heavy industries, HD Kumaraswamy, told reporters recently. However, he noted that government officials would not be part of the delegation. Reflecting similar anxieties, other nations with substantial automotive sectors have initiated requests for meetings with Chinese officials in recent weeks. Alternatives? The heavy reliance on China for critical components is again back in the limelight. Several auto component makers in India – and globally – are all working on alternatives to rare-earth magnet motors.  “In India, while we are working to speed up the import process, we are also evaluating alternative materials, including ferrite, different grades of magnets, different technologies, and different supply sources,” Sona Comstar CEO Vivek Vikram Singh told investors recently. “New ferrite-based motors offer both superior performance and a 100 percent indigenous supply chain. This is where India must invest,” said Ankit Somani, co-founder of Conifer.io, a startup building electric powertrains. Tech Challenges While alternatives offer a path to reducing dependence on critical materials, they come with challenges, especially in high-performance applications like electric vehicles. Issues like lower power density, lower efficiency, and increased size and weight of motors remain concerns. For instance, the Sona Comstar CEO said, “The technology is very sound, but the efficiency was not coming to the required levels.” This experience highlights the critical lesson that complete reliance on any one external source is no longer viable in an increasingly unpredictable global landscape.
