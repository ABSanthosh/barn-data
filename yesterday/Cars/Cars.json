    "description": "Just 78,012 vehicles rolled off UK lines in January Drop in exports exacerbates already tough situation for UK manufacturers UK vehicle production fell again in January as the sector faced – and continues to face – an array of global headwinds. These challenges are the result of softening demand for cars in key export markets, which has led manufacturers to slow new model rollouts and instead focus efforts on retooling factories for new-age EVs, said the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. As such, just 78,012 vehicles – both commercial (CV) and passenger – rolled off production lines in the first month of the year. This is down 17.7% on January 2024, when 94,811 vehicles were produced. Of the 78,012 vehicles produced, 71,104 were cars (down 14.3% year on year) and just 6908 were CVs (down a massive 41.5%). The SMMT said these figures are in part due to a strong January 2024, when car and commercial output surged by 21.0% and 27.5% respectively. That month was also the CV sector's best since 2008. As ever, foreign markets were the main destination for UK-made vehicles. In January, 78.7% (61,399) were exported, down 13.4% on last year. According to the SMMT, this decline was because of weakened global markets, such as the EU and China. In terms of passenger cars, of which 80.4% (57,140) went overseas, exports to the EU and China were down 11.2% and 46.3% respectively. Despite this, exports to the US, Turkey and Japan all rose, up 12.4%, 36.9% and 8.1%. For CVs, export numbers dropped 46.6% to 4259. UK market-bound vehicle numbers fell 30.5% to 16,613, of which 13,964 were cars (down 30.4%) and 2649 were CVs (down 31.1%). In a bid to boost export numbers, the SMMT has called on the government to release £2 billion of already promised investment via the Automotive Transformation Fund. Doing so, it said, “would help shore up the competitiveness of the UK’s largest exporter of manufactured goods, a sector with the potential to deliver £50 billion in UK growth over the coming decade”. SMMT CEO Mike Hawes added that releasing these funds would “help ensure our competitiveness and safeguard the billions of pounds of investment, jobs and economic growth which is now at stake”.",

    "description": "W1's turbocharged 4.0-litre V8 puts out a huge 915bhp on its own New hypercar packs a huge 1258bhp but is limited to the same 217mph top speed as its P1 predecessor The new McLaren W1 hypercar will not chase “Top Trumps numbers” but instead prioritise driver engagement and tractability in the real world. Although its 4.0-litre turbocharged V8 engine and electric motor combine for a bombastic 1258bhp, it's electronically limited to a top speed of 217mph. This figure matches the W1’s predecessor, the P1. It's also 23mph short of the number clocked by the 1992 McLaren F1, which was the world’s fastest road car for more than a decade – with half the W1’s power. Asked by Autocar why McLaren decided not to chase a new speed record, W1 vehicle line director Alex Gibson explained: “Ultimate top speed – Top Trumps – is not a number that we’re chasing with this product. \"To go to 400kph, 450kph [249mph, 280mph], there are compromises you have to make for real-world accessible driving on the road and track. Those were avenues we didn’t want to pursue with this product. “We didn’t want to get into really stiff sidewalls on the tyres, because then you compromise ride comfort on your day-to-day drives, which is the most accessible time. Most of the time this car will be used will be your point-to-point driving experience.” McLaren’s head of performance, Marcus Waite, suggested the top speed was limited because the W1 “needs to retain a certain harmony”. “It’s got so many roles to play: to be a car that can accelerate faster than a Speedtail, that can be faster around a track than a Senna,” he said. “We had to find a place that the car settled well. \"When we reflect on the choices that we can make, one of them is about how much cornering potential we keep in the car, and we’re clearly trading that. Even with our super-low-drag underfloor-generated ground-effect downforce, there’s still some drag under the car. It could push on a bit past 350kph [217mph] but actually, for the way we’ve designed the car to be used, that’s the right place for us now.” To that end, McLaren made several key decisions to improve the W1's tractability and overall driver engagement on the open road. Key to this is the decision to send the car’s huge power reserves through the rear wheels alone, rather than employing a four-wheel drive system for greater traction. This decision was made to preserve the steering feel for which McLaren’s previous models have received much praise, said Waite; its hydraulic power assistance would not have fit in the car had a driveline to the front wheels or an extra electric motor been added. Using rear-wheel drive also helped to cut weight significantly. Waite explained: “With all-wheel drive, particularly by the time you're accelerating all the time, you’re traction-limited. Up to around 130kph [81mph] using the front tyres is really helpful; there's many parts of a circuit where that’s a benefit. However, you're carrying around, depending on which system you use, 60, 70, 80kg, and that's weight that's in the car all the time. \"So it's fairly close to even [in terms of outright pace] but [with rear-wheel drive] it’s an overall more complete car that's much more engaging for the driver, and it’s true to who we are to do it this way.” Torque is limited in first and second gear to reduce wheelspin and boost traction. Chief powertrain engineer Richard Jackson said: “From a hardware point of view, we try to put that limit just above where the tyre traction limit will be. In reality, it's going to be right on the limit of traction through first and second gear.” The W1 also offers a range of driving modes to suit a range of environments, including a road-focused Comfort setting. This limits the car to the 915bhp yielded by its V8 alone, although the motor is still engaged to provide instant throttle response.",

The frontman of Taiwan’s Rough Crafts regularly turns his hand to other makes and models, constantly redefining his comfort zone. Rough Crafts’ latest project is a bigger departure from their usual remit than we’re used to, but it’s no less spectacular. Collaborating with Faber Lai at Faber Studio, Winston set out to turn a brand-new Yamaha Ténéré 700 into a slick flat tracker with all the Rough Crafts hallmarks. As usual, he nailed it. “The flat tracker is one of my favorite styles of custom builds—a nimble narrow chassis, upright sitting position, and wide handlebars, perfect for Taipei’s city streets,” Winston tells us.…",

    "description": "Looks-wise, the Moto Guzzi Breva 750 is one of the blandest motorcycles to ever roll out of the Mandello del Lario factory. But that doesn’t make it a bad bike—it just lacks the charisma of the several iconic Moto Guzzis that pundits usually drool over. Rusty Brains didn’t pick the Breva for its looks though. For their debut build, the Italian custom shop wanted a classic Moto Guzzi V-twin motor in a reliable package. The Breva ticked those boxes—and with a full overhaul on the cards, its looks hardly mattered. Based in Milan, Rusty Brains was founded by friends Luca Adami, Silvio Ferraretto, and Bogdan Lupu. Luca and Silvio each have over three decades of motorcycle design and modeling experience, and Bogdan is a pro photographer.…",

    "description": "It’s a pleasantly nippy morning, and I’ve just set off on a flashy red/black Aprilia Tuono 457. I’m in Sport mode with traction control switched off before I get going because it’s been a long time since I’ve been aboard an Aprilia Tuono, and I’m itching to have some fun. I stop at the side of the road as the convoy of Tuono 457s being piloted by other journalists passes me by, and I find myself smiling ear-to-ear as that lovely twin-cylinder soundtrack reverberates through the area. With the road empty and visor down, I plonk the Tuono in first and give it a prodigious handful of throttle, and immediately, the front wheel comes up! I almost run into the rev limiter as I shift into second, and again, the Tuono points skyward – we’re in for a thrilling day! Aprilia Tuono 457 design, differences from RS 457 To create the Tuono, Aprilia ditched the RS 457’s fairing, clip-ons and signature tri-lamp headlight setup in favour of a small new headlight and a handlebar. While the Tuono’s LED headlight isn’t as pretty as that of the RS, I do find it growing on me the more I look at it.  The headlight’s design grows on you with time. Aprilia’s technical team has also reprofiled the tank slightly for a little more lock-to-lock clearance and to accommodate the new handlebar, thereby reducing the fuel capacity by a marginal 300ml to 12.7 litres.  Aprilia has reprofiled the tank to accommodate the taller handlebar. The company has also shortened the final drive gearing with a one-tooth larger rear sprocket on the Tuono and given the bike rubber-mounted footpegs (in the same position as the RS), both of which are helpful when riding on the road. Unlike the RS, its footpegs have rubber tops. Since the Tuono’s chassis is the same as the RS, you may wonder why it weighs the exact same 175 kilos when it has a lot less bodywork. Aprilia engineers informed me that the Tuono’s smaller headlight actually weighs a fair deal more than the RS’ larger (but sleeker) unit, and the handlebar and its accoutrements make up for the RS’ fairing, which weighs just 3 kilos.  Aprilia Tuono 457 comfort, handling, city usability On the road, especially our far-from-ideal ones, the Tuono is a much better place to be than the RS because you sit almost upright with a slight bend toward the handlebar. Since the suspension travel and tuning are exactly the same as the RS – which means this is a stiffly sprung bike – the upright riding position makes road imperfections much more bearable. And that added comfort hasn’t come at the expense of the RS’ sublime handling. I’ll wager that, on the road, you’ll not miss the more focused ergonomics of the RS because this Tuono felt just as eager and composed as its faired sibling when attacking corners.  The Tuono 457 marries all-day comfort and engaging performance beautifully. The cherry on top is that the Tuono is also an absolute peach when handling the rigours of the concrete jungle. The parallel-twin engine that powers this bike was already very smooth with gobs of low and mid-range grunt, and with the shorter gearing, things only got better. You can pull away from a dead stop in second gear without protestation, and 45kph in sixth is devoid of any knocking. And despite the shorter gearing, you can comfortably cruise at 120kph (even 140 isn’t too bad except for the windblast) in top gear. And as I’ve said before, the Tuono is more than happy if you want to travel everywhere on just one wheel! So, is this a perfect bike?  Twin-cylinder engine is flexible, punchy and smooth. Aprilia Tuono 457 areas of improvement The Tuono 457 comes very close to being perfect but stops a few yards short. For one, at this price, the exclusion of adjustable levers and sintered brake pads seems like an avoidable oversight, although both are easy fixes for not a lot more money. And – we’ve said this for the RS 457, too – the quickshifter (sets you back a cool Rs 20,050) should be standard on the Tuono at its Rs 3.95 lakh sticker price. It’s also sad that this new naked design doesn’t offer the same looks and wind protection as the traditional semi-faired design theme seen on other Tuonos, setting it apart from most naked bikes.  Its dash is shared with the RS and has loads of features and tech.   Aprilia Tuono 457 price and verdict   But, in the grand scheme of things, these are minor niggles, which should tell you how good and rounded a package the Tuono 457 is. It can handle anything you throw at it on the road – be it carving corners, touring the country, or just commuting to work – while keeping you reasonably comfortable and engaged. For what it packs, its Rs 3.95 lakh price (Rs 25,000 less than the RS) is also reasonable, and the Tuono has no real direct rival.   Aside from the flashy red/black option, there's also a subtly classy white/grey colour. As I’m sure is clearly evident by now, this bike has me smitten, just like my own previous Tuono V4, and I’m seriously considering spending my money on it. If, like me, you enjoy fast and sporty yet reasonably comfortable machines, then the Tuono 457 warrants serious consideration. Also See: Aprilia Tuono 457 video review",

    "link": "",
    "description": "Another car bought sight unseen, another “gotta own this one someday” box checked. It also ticked the “probably definitely won’t break down” box, a critical facet for this purchase. The job? Scout the ’22 Overcrest Rally: 10 days, 8-10 hours a day, and thousands of miles, all in one state. Idaho. The 1979 300TD was rough but rust-free, and as my grandfather would say with a touch of irony, “a smooth runner with a straight body.” Despite its quirks, the W123’s legendary reliability and patience testing pace made it the perfect scout vehicle for the rally.   Most of the state is seen from a 72 mile jaunt across i90. A stretch easily defeated by those that would often rather be “there” than wherever “here” was. In about one episode of a podcast it's over and everyone is on to Spokane, Seattle, Portland, or some far off distant easterly place where pizza and bagels are made just right. No one hops off to venture inland to try some finger steaks or french fries from potatoes pulled out of the ground a few hours earlier. There are no grandma's huckleberry pies on the interstate either. But Idaho's uniqueness goes beyond just the food, it has roads. Some of the best one's you'll ever get the pleasure to find. Idaho proudly wears the Sawtooth Mountains at its heart. At the state’s beltline lies Boise, the capital city that initially wasn’t even on our radar. It lay too far below the squiggly tarmac and unknown mud and gravel of the forest roads. Before heading up there, the car needed a few things. It was the crest of summer, and the air conditioning didn’t work. We needed to install the European headlights that came with the car or we couldn’t bear our own existence. It didn’t have a roof rack, which seemed like a shame, and Jasin, the co-driver, a quiet, sharp, and witty man, wanted a bicycle in case we got stranded somewhere. “Dude, We are not going to need a bicycle. This thing is the most reliable vehicle ever made” “We might.” “We won’t…” Despite the w123 being the most reliable vehicle ever made, we ended up looking for a bike. After a bunch of “is it availables” we still ended up just going to a Pocatello pawn shop. We now had a bike (and cooler for Dews) on our roof rack. The air-conditioning swallowed up some cans of r134, and with some hotwiring of the compressor, we had ac. There was no power with it on, but we had it. 77hp with it off, and probably 65 with it at full chat. The vacuum system controlling the HVAC in the car was shot and screwdrivers were shoved through the vents to hold the blower flap open. It was the only way to get air flow. The fact that each one was essentially a guaranteed death by being impaled in an accident wasn’t lost on us, but aircon is aircon, the bastion and oil gilded holy grail of any old shitbox. If you’ve got it, you’re a king, and we had it. Us kings, royal purveyors and surveyors of the almighty road trip. May all without it bow before our superiority, piety, and condescension.  Far up into the mountains, we were met with snow. It was somewhere between \"no problem\" and \"big problem\" in depth, located a two-hour drive from where we’d started, and just 100 yards from the summit. The other side of the summit, and our route out, was right there. You could have hurled a stone and hit dirt on the other side. It was the answer to all of the “do we really want to drive 2 hours backwards?” considerations. The easy answer to this was no. No we did not. This route was supposed to be on the rally, which meant we’d have to drive back the other side just to check it out. The 30-40 yards of snow that swept across the mud was dense, and slushy, the last vestige of a long winter at 9000 feet. Making it through would save half a day of driving. The bike loomed. “What do you think?” “Not great.” “Not great… yeah.” “Should we make a run at it?” “Sure, why not.” Why not was that it was a really bad idea. At that altitude that car, even with the AC off was gutless. Maybe 50 hp. When it was new. 270k miles ago. The gearshift dropped into low and the old OM617 wheezed without spinning the tires in the mud towards the snow. There was no climax, no “ope, he might make it.” It was beached with just a few yards to go. The bike loomed again. Hours passed and after the digging with the top tray of a toolbox got tiresome the conversation got closer and closer to riding back down the mountain. In the middle of the debate a truck rounded the bend. After a chat the driver realized he wouldn't make it through either, but he did have a tow strap. Kings saved by mere mortals, a story for all time.  “Told you we wouldn’t need the bike.” On the way out, some sort of celestial car karma kicked in and the right front caliper seized. The roads were slick with rain and the car was not doing well downhill.  A call out to social media didn’t help and we were forced into heading to Boise to hit up a junkyard. There, the two wrench trick and some elbow grease yanked a caliper off an old w114 250C. It was pure luck the car was there and we knew it. This was the land of Bumpside Ford’s, not the land of vintage German tanks.  On the way out the door of the yard we spotted another w123 parked right next to ours. A turbo diesel sedan with a lot of miles. This thing had been around the block, a million times. It was well worn. The US headlights were in rough shape with one side missing the bezel, and the other side about to be.  The caliper got chucked in the backseat for later We knew exactly what we had to do. Working fast, we yanked the Euro-spec H4s out of their boxes, uninstalled the very nice US-spec lights, and swapped them out. Just as we finished, the owner of the million-block W123 walked up. As is often the case the man looked a bit like his car. He’d seen a few things and his weathered skin and thin wild hair spoke of it.   “Love your car sir.” “Thanks a lot.” “Hey so we noticed you maybe needed some headlights.” “Yep, thats why I was here, but no luck.” “I tell you what, take these.” “What do you want for them?” “Nothing.” The man thanked us, took the headlights graciously, hopped in his car, and clattered away. It's possible we got stuck and that caliper got seized for a reason.  Incredible roads were in abundance. Warm Lake Road, a monument to loneliness, curling up and up eternally, forcing us to shove snow in the engine compartment to keep going. White bird grade. A high bedrock set of switchbacks set in the hills below Grangeville. Both were empty. No one ever came, and it was ours for every mile. These roads are not in your backyard, and it takes significant effort to get out that far past the border of what people consider nowhere, but it's worth it, when you find out they’re all yours.    Continue...",

    "description": "\"The sum of its parts represents something that simply doesn't exist in the modern world anymore, and I had no clue what that was when I got it.\" David Steca didn’t need a project car he needed a daily driver. To the lot of us, that means something sensible and reliable, a car that you can use without thinking about it. To David it meant something steeped in function and style, that could be stuffed with camera gear, and handle complex filming rigs. A workhorse that would help him document stories, not only here for Petrolicious but for his own wrenching and exploration based automotive Youtube channel: Only a Roadtrip Away.    It could have been a simple choice of a simple car. There were plenty of options, cars with air conditioning, modern safety features, dead on reliability, and zero surprises. But David isn’t wired that way. Instead of a practical choice like Volkswagen Golf he bought a Peugeot 205 GTI, a 40 year old hot hatch. An odd choice for a daily, perhaps, but a valiant one. And if you roll the clock all the way back to the 80’s, it was as obvious then as it is now.  The 205 GTI was a working-class hero of 1980’s France, a true product of its era. It took what the Volkswagen GTI started and pushed things a bit farther. Where the GTI was predictable and planted, the 205 GTI was nervous and eager, rewarding drivers who knew how to handle its infamous lift-off oversteer. When it launched in 1984, it was designed to be a workhorse with a wild streak, a car that could handle the daily grind and still make a grocery run feel like a rally stage. For the French, it was practical but never boring, a commuter car with a backbone, something that could slip through tight Parisian streets during the week and carve up back roads on the weekend. It found a home with young professionals, tradesmen; collars but no ties. It wasn’t precious. It was just good. In a way, David is exactly who Peugeot had in mind when they built it. He was just 40 years too late to snag one off the assembly line.  This Peugeot, however, wasn’t a hero, not yet. The brakes were seized, the engine was a nightmare of misrouted hoses and mismatched parts, and nothing worked the way it should. “In the state that I bought it in, it wasn't drivable at all. The brakes were sticking. Everything was just old and cruddy,” David says. He doesn’t sound annoyed or frustrated, he sounds interested, like the car’s condition was, and would be just another part of its story, and his. Sourcing original parts became a treasure hunt, each find bringing the car one step closer to its former glory. Late nights in the garage, poring over manuals and tinkering with the engine, became routine. The goal was clear: transform the Peugeot into a dependable daily driver, something he could trust. It wasn’t about chasing perfection, itwas about striking the right balance between preserving what was there and replacing what was beyond saving. “There's no shortcut. You have to go through everything,” he says.  The 205 GTI rewards that kind of attention. It’s not a fast car by today’s standards, but it feels quick within it’s context. It asks you to be present, to engage. “Every bit of control that this vehicle has is analog,” David says. “You brake way later or you don’t brake at all and you turn way sharper than you would normally do.” There’s nothing digital to filter the experience. It demands a certain kind of dedication, or loyalty, and if you don’t give those, it won’t give anything back. David’s approach to getting the Peugeot going wasn’t about achieving perfection. It was about understanding the car for what it was and bringing out the best in it. There’s a humility in that, and an honesty in giving the car its purpose back. When he talks about the car, it’s clear he discovered more than he expected. Now, the humble hatchback is not only David's daily driver, but his on set workhorse, a humble partner in his film creations here in Petrolicious, on his own Youtube channel, and elsewhere.  This 205 GTI isn’t only a tool for getting from A to B, despite David’s original intent. It’s a shade of his life philosophy. David isn’t interested in rushing or forcing things into place. He lets stories, whether on film or on the road, unfold naturally. He works through what’s in front of him, trusts the process, and knows that if he does it right, the end result will speak for itself.  Continue...",

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/2025-mercedes-e-450-review-the-smart-man-amg-434658#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Car+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "The Mercedes-Benz E-Class is the go-to luxury car for anyone with money. It’s the German luxury brand’s number one model and the bestselling car in its class, largely thanks to its long wheelbase, which provides the much-coveted legroom rear-seat passengers desire. In India, where luxury sedans are predominantly chauffeur-driven, rear-seat comfort is a top priority. BMW, recognising Mercedes’ winning formula, finally joined the long-wheelbase club with its latest 5 Series. But Mercedes struck back with an even stronger offering – the new E-Class with three engine options, ensuring it covers all bases. The E 450 is priced Rs 14 lakh higher than the E 200. We tested the E 200, the base version, which we loved for its ride comfort, but the engine is a bit anaemic and just doesn’t have the pep customers who want to drive would like. That’s where the range-topping E 450 4MATIC with the M256 engine comes in. The 3-litre, straight-six turbo petrol mill produces a humongous 177hp more than the 2-litre unit in the E 200, and because of that, the E 450, with an ex-showroom price of Rs 92.5 lakh, costs Rs 14 lakh more than the E 200; the on-road price is well north of a crore. However, aside from the upgraded powertrain and all-wheel drive (4MATIC), equipment levels remain essentially the same. So, are the extra horses and traction worth the extra rupees? The answer lies in the driving experience. Mercedes E 450 exterior design Despite the AMG Line package, the E 450 doesn’t look as sporty as the AMG counterparts The E 450 comes in AMG Line trim only, which includes these 5-spoke alloy wheels; high profile tyres, though good for ride comfort, spoil the stance. Visually, the E 450 LWB maintains the stately limousine aesthetic of its lesser siblings. The only differences are the trapezoid exhausts, the AMG Line-styled front bumpers and AMG alloys, which, wrapped in high-profile rubber in the interests of ride comfort, quite frankly don’t look very sporty. Otherwise, it is unlike its AMG counterparts, which flaunt their muscle with aggressive bumpers, flared wheel arches and loud exhausts. Mercedes E 450 engine and performance Not as loud as full-fat AMGs, but still blisteringly quick Smooth 3.0-litre straight-six engine produces 381hp and 500Nm of torque. At the heart of the E 450 is Mercedes’ M256 engine, churning out 381hp and 500Nm of torque. Paired with a mild-hybrid system that adds a temporary 23hp boost, the E 450 rockets from 0kph to 100 in a blistering 4.5 seconds. That’s the kind of acceleration you’d expect from a proper AMG, yet here, it’s delivered in the most refined manner possible. Unlike the full-fat AMG models with aggressive exhausts and crackling overrun sounds, the E 450 remains discreet. It doesn’t shout about its capabilities, but make no mistake – it moves with serious intent. The 6-cylinder engine is silky smooth, and the 9-speed AT is impeccably tuned With a claimed 0-100kph in 4.5 seconds, the E 450 is quick. The 9-speed automatic transmission is impeccably tuned, delivering almost imperceptible shifts in Comfort mode but responding with urgency when you put your foot down. More than just performance, there’s something to be said about a six-cylinder engine, which, quite frankly, is even becoming a rarity in the Mercedes world. A straight-six feels so much smoother, so much more effortless than a four-cylinder, and it’s the velvety punch, the lusty power that marks out this motor. It also sounds so much sweeter and richer than a four-cylinder, reminding you there’s something special under the hood. The other ace up its sleeve is the 4MATIC all-wheel-drive system, adding a reassuring layer of security when pushing hard or tackling loose surfaces. Mercedes E 450 ride and handling Ride quality isn’t as plush as the 5 Series but strikes a better balance between sporty and comfortable  Long-wheelbase cars often struggle with ground clearance, but not the E-Class – it glides over most speed breakers without scraping its underside. Ride comfort has always been a core strength of the E-Class, and this latest version, like the E 200, remains absolutely top-class. It soaks up bumps, undulations and everything Mumbai roads throw at it with ease. However, dare I say, the ride isn’t quite as plush as the new 5 Series, which has sacrificed a little of its signature sporty edge for an extra degree of comfort. What’s remarkable about the E 450 is that it hasn’t sacrificed anything. It feels sporty, nimble and agile without compromising on comfort – a rare balance that Mercedes has absolutely nailed. Handling and agility are impressive for a car of this size The E 450 is such a joy to drive, you’ll be happy to trade the luxurious back seat for the thrill behind the wheel. Of course, having a strong engine is one thing, but being able to fully exploit that power is another. And that’s where the E 450 truly shines. The body control is superb, the handling precise, and the agility impressive for a car of this size. But what really stands out is the steering. Mercedes has aced it – it’s that perfect blend of accuracy, feedback and lightness, making it effortless to manoeuvre at slow speeds while still being engaging when you pick up the pace. Mercedes E 450 interior and features No other car in its class comes close to the E-Class in terms of rear seat comfort But here’s the question: at slow speeds or in traffic, is it really the driver’s seat you should be in? I ease myself into the back seat to remind myself why the E-Class is the segment’s bestseller in the first place. Step inside, and the E 450’s interior is a masterclass in luxury. The dashboard is dominated by Mercedes’ Superscreen – a stunning combination of a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a 14.4-inch central touchscreen and a 12.3-inch passenger display. While the tech is impressive, Mercedes has taken a largely buttonless approach, meaning even basic functions like climate control require navigating menus. It’s sleek but occasionally frustrating. The selfie camera in the dashboard for video calls is neat, though one for the rear-passengers might have been more appropriate. Rear-seat comfort is where the E-Class truly distances itself from rivals, especially the 5 Series. In this department, nothing comes quite as close. The long-wheelbase variant offers limousine-like legroom, but it’s not just the space – it’s how Mercedes has used it. The reclining rear seats, which tilt from 24 to 36 degrees, make a huge difference in comfort, allowing passengers to stretch out in a near-business-class position. Pair that with the chauffeur package, which lets you electrically move the front passenger seat forward when unoccupied, and you can comfortably sit cross-legged – just as you would at home. Where the 5 Series falters, the E-Class excels. BMW’s new 5 Series LWB has softened its ride to appeal to chauffeur-driven buyers, but it still doesn’t offer the same seat recline, legroom, or sheer sense of indulgence. One key area where the 5 Series loses out is the lack of rear sunshades–in the E-Class, you get electrically operated sunshades all around, including a rear sunblind, enhancing privacy and comfort. The E-Class is still the reigning champ in terms of rear-seat experience in this segment. The Burmester 4D surround sound system with Dolby Atmos further elevates the experience, turning the E-Class’ cabin into a rolling concert hall. And then, there’s an interesting modern touch – Mercedes has included a selfie and video camera on the dashboard. It’s great for video calls, though one could argue a rear-seat camera for executives attending Zoom meetings would have made more sense. Ultimately, the E-Class is the luxury sedan to beat. For most owners, this will be a chauffeur-driven car from Monday to Friday, but when the weekend arrives, there’s more than enough under the hood to tempt them into the driver’s seat. Mercedes E 450 price and verdict The E450 4MATIC is a perfect blend sportiness and comfort without compromising either   The E 450 4MATIC is the ultimate stealth weapon. It’s got the power and acceleration to rival an AMG but without the loud styling and exhaust theatrics. It delivers everything the E 53 AMG does in real-world driving: effortless power, a rewarding drive and a level of comfort no sports sedan can match. Unless you truly crave the full AMG experience, the E 450 offers 90 percent of the performance with 100 percent of the practicality. It’s the thinking man’s AMG – a car that lets you enjoy serious performance while flying under the radar. The way it blends sportiness and comfort without compromising either is something not even the cheaper 5 Series can match. Pricey it is, but that’s the cost you pay for getting the best of both worlds.

    "description": "There’s little doubt the Hyundai Ioniq 5, our 2024 Car of the Year, is one of the best cars Hyundai has put to market in recent times. Part of this is because it breaks new ground and seamlessly integrates modern EV tech into regular everyday motoring. Using the Ioniq 5 for the past couple of months has literally been transformative. The large 72.6kWh battery and good efficiency of 5.5-6.0km per kWh in Eco mode allow me to charge the battery once a week at work (six hours at 11kW). What makes the Ioniq 5 experience even more seamless is that it is such a comfortable and easy car to live with. It gives between 440km and 460km on a full charge when driven in Mumbai traffic. Sure, it’s wide, and that does take some getting used to in congested Mumbai traffic, but what gets the corners of my mouth to curl up is that it does such a good job almost everywhere else. Take the supple and absorbent ride for instance – near perfect for Mumbai’s lunar roads; the superb sound insulation that creates a hush inside the cabin despite a wedding procession outside, the very comfortable and almost armchair-like seats, which can be adjusted at the front and rear, or the fact that even in Eco mode, the Ioniq 5 has enough zip. And Eco also gives me a range between 420km and 440km on a single charge. It’s big and wide, so squeezing into tight parking slots isn’t always easy. On sections where there are multiple speed cameras, I use the ADAS, which works great so long as the cameras can see the lane markings clearly. It even drives the tight corner inside the Coastal Road tunnel perfectly, slows down for slower traffic ahead, comes to a full stop, and starts up again without any input from the driver. You have to hold the steering wheel, of course; otherwise, the car puts out a warning. You can have Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, but only if you carry a wire. What I do miss is having wireless Apple CarPlay, a definite pain point as I use Google Maps every day for route selection. The faster route is 15-20 minutes quicker, at times. Other pet peeves include the dull fascia and the lack of a spare tyre, and when you really begin to enjoy driving this rear-wheel-drive version with its sharpish front end and direct steering, the long-travel, soft rear suspension lets you down. I do like the fact that the centre console slides back and allows the driver to exit from the left door quite easily; this helps when you need to park this really wide EV. The best bit is that it’s an EV that is both characterful and charming. Good-quality rubber helps deliver both direct steering and a comfy ride.   Also See: Hyundai Ioniq 5 long term review, 19,500km report Hyundai Ioniq 5 long term review, 15,900km report",

    "description": "India’s two-wheeler industry remains a key player in the automotive sector, with 16.56 million units dispatched by OEMs in the first 10 months of FY2025, reflecting a 10.7 percent year-on-year increase. Motorcycles lead with 63 percent of the market share, followed by scooters at 35 percent, while mopeds also showed some growth. India's two-wheeler market is growing, with motorcycles at 63 percent share. The 100-110cc segment leads, with 110-150cc growing fast. Buyers are shifting to premium 200-300cc bikes, causing a decline in the 150-200cc segment. SIAM data shows that nearly all motorcycle sub-segments have experienced growth, except for the 150cc to 200cc category. This analysis explores the reasons behind its struggles amidst the broader market's positive trends. The 100-110cc segment leads with 4.83 million units sold, up 2 percent, capturing 46 percent of the market. The 110cc-125cc segment follows with 3.05 million units, a 15 percent growth, and 29 percent market share. The 125cc-150cc category saw a 42 percent growth, selling 607,721 units and holding 6 percent of the market. However, the 150cc to 200cc sub-segment, the third-largest in terms of volume, has faced a decline. With 932,332 units sold and a 9 percent market share, it’s down by 8 percent compared to last year, selling 78,658 fewer units between April 2024 and January 2025. This drop can largely be attributed to weaker performances from major players like Bajaj Auto, Honda, Hero MotoCorp, and Suzuki. TVS and Yamaha shine, but Bajaj, Honda, Hero \u0026 SUZUKI FEEL THE HEAT A closer look at the brand-wise performance in the 150-200cc bike market from April 2024 to January 2025 highlights key trends and reveals the struggle of slow-selling products. TVS Motor Co. TVS Motor Co. leads the 150-200cc segment with four offerings of the  Apache RTR series. With 364,050 units sold in the first 10 months of FY2025, the Apache accounts for 39 percent of the sub-segment, marking an 18 percent YoY increase. It surpasses the TVS Raider, which saw a 14 percent YoY decline with 340,699 units sold. India Yamaha Motor Yamaha has sold 200,185 motorcycles in the current fiscal, marking a 6 percent YoY increase and capturing a 21 percent share of the 150-200cc segment. The company offers two models: the MT-15 V2.0 and the YZF R15, of the two, the MT-15 has seen a significant demand spike, with a nearly 50 percent YoY growth, while the famed R15 is experiencing slower sales. Bajaj Auto Bajaj Auto has sold 188,754 units in the 150-200cc category over the past 10 months, reflecting an 18 percent decline compared to the previous year’s 231,374 units. This translates to 42,620 fewer motorcycles sold. The company offers nine models in this segment, including six Pulsars, the Avenger 160 Street and two KTM 200s. While sales of the Pulsar range have dropped by about 20 percent, demand for KTM models has remained relatively stable. Honda Motorcycle \u0026 Scooter India (HMSI) Honda Motorcycles India has seen a 36 percent year-on-year drop in sales within the 150-200cc category, selling 134,778 units, 75,653 fewer than the previous year. The brand’s four models in this segment—Unicorn 160, SP160, Hornet 2.0, and CB200X (now NX200) have been affected. With the Unicorn 160, typically being the top seller, experiencing a notable slowdown. However, the recent December 2024 update of the Unicorn 160, featuring an OBD2B-compliant engine and a TFT dash may help boost sales. In contrast, the SP160 has seen strong demand, with sales nearly doubling. This model also now benefits from OBD2B compliance and TFT display like other recently updated Hondas. Additionally, both the Hornet 2.0 and CB200X (now NX200) are receiving positive attention, signaling a shift in consumer preference toward higher-powered motorcycles. Both the Hornet 2.0 and NX200 have recently received updates and this should help in boosting sales. Hero MotoCorp Hero MotoCorp ranks fifth in the 150-200cc segment, with 32,141 units sold, reflecting a 39 percent year-on-year decline. The company offers two models: the Xtreme 160R and the Xpulse 200 4V. Among these, the Xpulse 200 is seeing stronger demand, especially following its recent update. Suzuki Motorcycle India From April 2024 to January 2025, Suzuki Motorcycle India sold 11,761 units of the 155cc Gixxer and Gixxer SF, reflecting a 36 percent year-on-year decline. India Kawasaki Motor The last of the bike makers in this list, sold 663 units of the 177cc W175 Street. Are 150-200cc motorcycle buyers migrating? The 150-200cc premium commuter segment, the third largest in the overall motorcycle market, faces pressure from both the 125-150cc category and the segments above it. The 125-150cc bikes have experienced a notable 42 percent growth, with a rise in market share from 4.41 percent to 6 percent, suggesting a shift toward more fuel-efficient options as buyers opt for affordability over performance.  However, the Union Budget’s promises of increased disposable income could shift this trend. Meanwhile, the 200-250cc (up by 17% to 110,297 units) and 250-350cc (up by 3% to 703,475 units) segments have gained traction. This is probably down to buyers moving from the 150-200cc segment towards more premium, feature-rich options. This shift is aided by the narrowing price gap between these bikes and the high-spec 150-200cc models, attracting first-time buyers seeking a balance of style, performance, and value.

    "description": "The next-generation Citroen C5 Aircross was unveiled in concept guise in October 2024, and we've now got leaked design patent images of the production-spec SUV, thanks to our friends at motor.es. To be underpinned by parent firm Stellantis’ STLA Medium platform, the 2025 C5 Aircross doesn’t stray too far away from the concept that previewed its design. An official unveiling is expected later this year. New C5 Aircross takes some design cues from Oli concept of 2022 Will be larger than outgoing SUV with more focus on interior space Expected to come with hybrid and electric powertrain options 2025 Citroen C5 Aircross exterior design The next-gen C5 Aircross looks like an evolution of the current design, drawing some influences from the Citroen Oli Concept from 2022. It features a mix of both sharp lines and smooth rounded surfaces. The slim headlamps with the three-piece C-shaped LED DRLs have been retained from the concept. The bumper also gets a two-tone finish with an air intake down below. 2025 Citroen C5 Aircross concept vs production-spec In profile, the flush door handles from the concept have made for regular pull-type ones, there’s prominent plastic cladding over the wheel arches and the alloys have been toned down a little,  featuring a petal-like design. The detailing around the D-pillar also creates a floating effect for the roof, and the shoulder line looks quite muscular from these angles. At the rear, the C-shaped theme continues for the tail lamps with a connecting LED light bar, while the rear bumper also gets a two-tone finish.    We haven’t got a look at the interior of the new C5 Aircross yet, but it will likely be more spacious than the current model. The C5 Aircross concept measured 4,650mm, which makes it 150mm longer than the current model, and that could translate to more interior space. 2025 Citroen C5 Aircross engine options As already mentioned, the next-gen C5 Aircross will be the first Citroen model to be based on the STLA Medium platform. Although specific powertrain details aren’t available yet, it is expected to get both hybrid as well as all-electric powertrain options. Citroen will officially unveil the new C5 Aircross later this year, so stay tuned for more details. The current C5 Aircross is assembled in India from CKD kits, but there’s no confirmation yet if the next-gen SUV will also be offered here in India.
