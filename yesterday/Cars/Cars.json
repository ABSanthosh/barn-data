    "description": "The Reise name is quite nascent in the Indian biking community. Initially known for their tyres, particularly off-road-centric ones, the brand later forayed into the motorcycle gear space by retailing products from other manufacturers. Now, Reise has launched their own line, and when they offered to provide us with jackets for review, I was particularly pleased to get my hands on the Reise PineAir jacket. After using it for over three months, here’s what I’ve gathered. The front pockets are waterproof and keep items safe during unexpected showers. At a glance, it’s a smart-looking jacket, no doubt. The beige colour certainly has its own appeal in a world dominated by darker riding gear. It features Velcro adjustments on the arms and back to ensure a snug fit. The front pockets, mind you, are waterproof, and after being caught in a few unexpected showers, I can personally vouch for that claim. The PineAir comes with a comprehensive protection package, by which I mean it features CE Level 2-certified armour for the elbows, shoulders, back and chest. A low-speed fall on a broken concrete road gave me the chance to ‘test’ the elbow armour. I’m happy to report that the armour absorbed all the impact, leaving my hand injury-free, save for a minor bruise from the armour. Could’ve been worse. The jacket material did pick up a few abrasions in the accident, but it was a worthy sacrifice, and the jacket is still perfectly usable.  Frequently touched areas are prone to collecting dirt on this beige colour jacket.  Now, we’re based in Mumbai, and this year, temperatures consistently hovered around the 35-degC mark (felt more like 40 due to the humidity). I must say, at a standstill, the heat does build up significantly; traffic stops made me feel like a potato wrapped in aluminium foil roasting over an open fire. However, once I got moving, the airflow improved considerably. Of course, the Reise PineAir is primarily a touring jacket, and that shows on the highway, where the ventilation works best, something the swarming traffic of Mumbai isn’t quite representative of. On the topic of it being a touring jacket, there is a bit of heft to it, and its 2.2kg weight does become cumbersome during city runs.  Cordura enhances protection along with the CE Level 2-certified armour. Remember that beautiful sand colour I liked so much? Well, over time, I also learned that it’s quite prone to collecting dirt, especially on frequently touched areas like the pockets, wrist cuffs and collar. While a wash does clean it up, it’s something to keep in mind, as it can leave a visible mark without much effort, but fortunately, there is also a stealthy black colour available.   The PineAir offers solid protection, ample storage and stylish looks, and at a price of Rs 10,000, this is a good alternative to other Indian-made jackets at a similar price.

    "description": "The once genre-defining family car reinvents itself for the EV era We’ll delve into the various strengths, weaknesses and quirks of the new Renault Scenic in just a moment, but perhaps the biggest story here is one comprehended merely by looking at the car.You’ll notice that the fifth-generation Scenic on test here has a two-box design in the crossover style that’s now completely commonplace. This marks a seismic change in the Scenic philosophy, which for the previous four generations had been expressed with a one-box silhouette that the French call ‘monospace’.The earliest Scenic of the mid-1990s was the brainchild of Renault’s visionary chief designer, Patrick Le Quement, and was the original sensibly sized MPV. It was regarded at the time as a revelation in packaging and usability, and the fact that the Scenic has now fallen into line with everything else in terms of its packaging really does represent the final nail in the MPV coffin. Thrusting SUV-type cars are what sells these days.But even switching to a two-box design – even one as handsome as this new Scenic undeniably is – doesn’t guarantee success. The other big twist in the Scenic’s story is that the car is now solely electric-powered, and operating in the circa-£40,000, mid-size crossover EV sphere brings with it almost endless competition.This new Renault goes up against the Skoda Enyaq, Tesla Model Y, the Volkswagen ID 4, Peugeot e-3008, the Hyundai Kona EV and lower-spec versions of Hyundai’s Ioniq 5, as well as its mechanically related cousin, the Nissan Ariya. Compared with the original of 1996, this Scenic could hardly be less niche-busting.Renault would argue that it doesn’t need to be. The new car’s sharp exterior design, plus an interesting interior that makes laudable use of recycled materials, along with strong on-paper driving range and adequate performance, will make it the natural choice for many buyers, according to the French car maker. What we will now find out is whether that really is the case.The range at a glanceModelsPowerFrom60kWh Techno168bhp£37,44087kWh Techno215bhp£40,940The Scenic E-Tech range consists of two powertrain options – one with a 60kWh battery and a 168bhp motor, and another with an 87kWh battery and a 215bhp motor – and three trim levels. Techno is the entry point and the line-up rises through Esprit Alpine to top-ranking Iconic. Four-wheel drive is a possibility with this platform but it is not, says Renault, on the cards for now.",

    "description": "New VLE can travel from Stuttgart to Rome with two rapid-charging stops Mercedes-Benz is putting the finishing touches to the VLE, the first in a new wave of electric vans that will arrive next year as part of a new-look V-Class range. It is based on Mercedes’ new Van Electric Architecture (VAN.EA) and will be a more focused proposition than the existing V-Class, which is based on the Vito van. Essentially a van equivalent to the E-Class saloon, it will be positioned under the more opulent VLS that Mercedes refers to as a ‘grand limousine’, and instead target large families and taxi firms. The VLE is currently being tested ahead of its launch, which is expected to take place next year. Much of the work has focused on validating the van’s efficiency and performance, with the most recent test – a run from Stuttgart in Germany to Rome in Italy, crossing the Alps – investigating its endurance. Mercedes said its test engineers drove according to “normal operation” on the road and the cabin was air conditioned to 22deg C for the entire route. The vehicle completed the drive in 13 hours, stopping twice – for 15min at a time – to recharge. Given the total route is 683 miles long, that points to a real-world range of around 250 to 300 miles, although Mercedes has yet to disclose an official figure. “Our future MPVs have once again impressively demonstrated their suitability for everyday use,” said Andreas Zygan, head of development for Mercedes-Benz Vans. In addition to eight-seat MPVs, the VLE is also expected to spawn various specialised versions, such as an electric counterpart to the Marco Polo camper.",

    "description": "The Skoda Slavia, in its Monte Carlo trim, has really been turning heads. Not because it’s new, but I guess in a jam full of SUVs, a sedan wearing bright red is quite the attention-grabber. Walking up to it makes me happy the moment I see it parked there, knowing that the 1.5 TSI engine will be a delight to drive. Oh, and on a side note, I just realised ‘jam’ would be an apt collective noun for a group of cars. The storage space under the front armrest is nice and deep. So far, I’ve used the Slavia only within the city, but with summer vacations on and traffic appreciably lighter, I’ve actually been able to enjoy clear roads, steady cruising, and decent fuel efficiency, too. I’ve managed an overall figure of about 8.5kpl over this past month – not bad for a petrol automatic in Mumbai, and I haven’t been driving with efficiency in mind. You can only have a dial display of the speedo or tacho, not both together. Rather, it’s been tempting to enjoy the 150hp and 250Nm of torque, which makes it responsive off the line and also allows you to take advantage of empty stretches of tarmac. It’s amazing how quickly you’ll be nudging the 70kph speed limit around town. Beyond outright speed, though, it’s the crisp nature of its power delivery that you will enjoy every time you dab the throttle, so don’t think of this as something you can only enjoy out on highways. Have to say, though, at very low speeds, it sometimes trips up between 1st and 2nd gear, typical of so many DSGs. Indented shelf cubby neatly creates two separate handy storage spaces. Another bit that annoys me – even though it’s a far smaller issue – is the instrument display. It’s customisable and has dials, but you can only call up a speedo or a tacho dial, not both at the same time. And while I’m on about stuff I don’t like, let’s talk air conditioning. The VW Group’s India 2.0 cars were known to have subpar ACs, and while this one is just about holding up against the summer, every now and then, you will need to tweak the temperature or fan speed, and those touch controls are fiddly to use. The indentation does help, but it’s hard to get a precise change in temperature or fan speed, and you need to look down to confirm just how much has changed. Console slot should have been deeper to easily store the key fob. Such a contrast to the steering-mounted audio controls. The track selection buttons fall into hand easily, and the volume scroll wheel is simply a delight to use: quick, easy, and with a nice tactile feel as well. It’s a familiar Skoda, and it’s nice to see these on the India 2.0 cars too. Speaking of familiar Skoda traits, there’s a ‘simply clever’ bit I really like and put to use every day; the centre console cubby has an indented shelf design that creates two spaces within and neatly holds my phone on the wireless charging mat and my wallet in the space ahead. And while I’m on about storage, the boot is pretty handy, too, at 521 litres. That’s around what some SUVs offer. So, if plans materialise, I’ll be off to Goa soon, and after a raft of SUVs, I think it’s this sedan I’ll take this time around.

    "description": "The compact SUV segment continues to grow, and the latest entrant in this tightly contested space is the Skoda Kylaq. It offers everything we liked about the Skoda Kushaq in a smaller and more affordable package, so the question is: how does it stack up against the winner of our last compact SUV comparison, the Mahindra XUV 3XO? Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO exterior design and engineering Kylaq looks proportionate and mature, while the 3XO is distinctive. Let’s start with the way they look. Both models measure just under 4m in length, but the Kylaq looks more proportionate. The wide signature front grille, split headlamps and chunky bumper work well to give the Skoda a good presence. Around the side, the 17-inch alloys, chunky cladding and roof rails add some flavour, while the faux scuff plate at the back gives it an outdoorsy look. However, the small square tail-lights make it appear more like a hatchback rather than a crossover. XUV 3XO styling may not appeal to everyone In comparison, the 3XO’s tail looks abruptly cut off, as it’s based on the 4m+ Ssangyong Tivoli. Like newer Mahindras, the 3XO has a polarising design, to say the least. Vertically oriented headlights, C-shaped daytime running lamps and a sharply cut bumper lend the 3XO its distinctive face. Like the Skoda, the Mahindra also gets 17-inch rims, body cladding and roof rails to further its SUV look. The rear is characterised by a full-width LED light bar and a chunky bumper. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO specificationsKylaqXUV 3XOLength (mm)3,9953,990Width (mm)1,7831,821Height (mm)1,6191,647Wheelbase (mm)2,5662,600Boot capacity (litres)360295Ground clearance (mm)189201Tyre size205/55 R17215/55 R17Engine3 cyls, 999cc, turbo-petrol3cyl, 1197cc, turbo-petrolPower115hp at 5000-5500rpm131hp at 5000rpmTorque178Nm at 1750-4000rpm230Nm at 1500-2500rpmGearbox6-speed torque converter auto6-speed torque converter auto Overall, the XUV does appear to be the more substantial of the two, given that it’s the widest and has the longest wheelbase in the segment. The XUV also has the advantage of 201mm ground clearance; the Kylaq’s is 189mm. However, the Skoda does have an edge when it comes to boot space, measuring 360 litres up to the parcel shelf, while the Mahindra has a 295-litre capacity. Both can also be expanded further thanks to split-folding rear seats, though the Skoda has a deeper boot. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO interior space and comfort Kylaq interior is built tough, but all-black scheme detract from sense of space All-black theme with green trim gives Kylaq cabin a sporty vibe; quality is solid. These two also take a different approach on the inside. The Kylaq, as expected, closely resembles the Kushaq, with shared elements like the high-quality, 2-spoke steering wheel, digital instrument cluster and touch-based panel for climate control. However, Skoda has added some flash value by giving it olive green inserts on the dashboard, door panels and centre console, along with a light-textured fascia. Overall, the design is clean and uncluttered and has a solid build, which is only furthered by the reassuring ‘thud’ you get when closing the doors. It has a dual-tone theme, but the black upholstery can make you feel hemmed in, especially when compared to the XUV. It has a practical interior, too, with large doorbins, plenty of cubbies, and some typically Skoda ‘Simply Clever’ touches like the phone slots on the front seatbacks, a ticket holder on the windshield, and more. Headroom and kneeroom are decent, but it’s only wide enough for two. The Kylaq’s front seats are better in this company, given that they offer better support and feature electric adjustment and ventilation. But in terms of the backseat, it falls behind the Mahindra. It has an adequate amount of legroom and headroom for average-sized adults, but the narrow cabin and the seat contouring mean it is best suited for two passengers. Rear occupants get their own AC vents, Type-C charging ports, adjustable headrests and a centre armrest with cupholders. XUV 3XO cabin feels airier and more premium Looks and feels more premium, thanks to soft-touch materials and light upholstery. In comparison, the XUV 3XO’s interior looks and feels more upmarket. The light-coloured upholstery uplifts the space, as does the panoramic sunroof, but the ivory seats will be challenging to keep clean. Top-spec versions get a soft-touch finish on the dash; there’s a generous use of gloss black, and elements like the steering wheel, window switches and light/wiper stalks feel top-notch. It’s also nice that the XUV gets physical buttons and knobs for the dual-zone climate control. Like the Kylaq, the 3XO has plenty of storage spaces in the cabin, with large doorbins, a good-sized cooled glove box, and more. XUV 3XO's rear seat has more room and can comfortably fit three adults. You’ll appreciate the view you get out of the cabin from the XUV, and the bonnet flares give you the feeling that you’re driving an SUV. The front seats, even though they’re well-cushioned, aren’t as accommodating as the Kylaq’s, and you’ll also miss that you don’t get electric adjustment or ventilation. But it’s at the rear where the Mahindra has the most evident advantage. Owing to its width, three adults can sit comfortably in the XUV, and the long wheelbase means that legroom is plenty, too. If anything, accommodating the mechanism for the sunroof has eaten into headroom, but that’ll only be an issue for those taller than 6 feet. Amenities at the back include AC vents, a centre armrest with cupholders, a 12V port and a USB Type-C charger.

Commendably, both the Kylaq and XUV 3XO have a 5-star BNCAP rating. However, they both have features unique to them as well. Kylaq one-ups XUV 3XO with powered and ventilated front seats Ventilated front seats unique to the Kylaq. The Kylaq’s front seats have ventilation and power adjustment, which the XUV lacks, and we found the output from the Skoda’s 4-speaker and 2-tweeter audio system to be more consistent. The Skoda makes do with smaller 10-inch and 8-inch screens for the infotainment and cluster, respectively. However, its screen features a newer UI compared to its stablemates, and on the whole, this system is slick and has good graphics. XUV 3XO gets Level 2 ADAS, 360-degree camera, rear disc brakes, and more 3XO’s panoramic sunroof will be a big draw. Coming to the XUV 3XO, the AX7 L featured here gets a larger panoramic sunroof, larger 10.25-inch screens, an electronic parking brake, a 360-degree camera, more connected tech, a 7-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, rear disc brakes, and Level 2 ADAS (blind-spot monitor, autonomous emergency braking, lane-keep assist, and more) over the Kylaq’s range-topping Prestige variant. The ADAS features work well on a clearly marked road and can be switched off completely, too, should you want to. I found the blind-spot monitor, which appears in the instrument cluster, to be particularly useful. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO performance and refinement Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO performanceAccelerationKylaqXUV 3XO0-20kph (seconds)1.471.370-40kph (seconds)2.972.780-60kph (seconds)5.134.720-80kph (seconds)7.977.610-100kph (seconds)11.6911.050-120kph (seconds)16.0215.7420-80kph (seconds)6.386.3840-100kph (seconds)8.728.11 Now, on to the driving bits. Both SUVs are powered by a 3-cylinder, direct-injection, turbo-petrol engine, but they vary in displacement and output. The Kylaq has a smaller 1.0-litre unit that puts out 115hp and 178Nm, while the 3XO’s larger 1.2-litre motor produces 131hp and 230Nm. Both versions tested were paired with the same Aisin-sourced 6-speed torque converter automatic gearbox. 131hp 1.2L mill feels strong throughout rev range. Given the difference in output, the Mahindra is naturally quicker in a sprint to 100kph, completing it in 11.05sec to the Kylaq’s 11.69sec. The Skoda claws back in the 20-80kph run, posting an identical time of 6.38sec, but it is marginally slower in the 40-100kph run. Skoda 1.0 TSI feels stronger than expected 115hp 1.0 TSI engine punches above its weight. The Kylaq’s engine is slightly slower to respond at low speeds, and that’s something you’ll have to get used to in city driving. But then on, power delivery becomes smooth and progress easy. The TSI engine punches above its weight and feels significantly stronger than its cubic capacity would have you believe. And that’s most evident in the mid-range. What helps make the most of the mid-range are the paddle shifters, which add to the engagement. And even in fully automatic mode, the gearbox does its job rather smoothly. In isolation, the Kylaq’s engine is refined, but it is the noisier unit in comparison. XUV 3XO feels punchier at low speeds The XUV 3XO has a significant power and torque advantage, and you feel as much from the get-go. Drive modes also help fine-tune the experience. Just as you start out, you’ll feel that the XUV 3XO is more responsive at low speeds. However, you have to be mindful – at least in city driving conditions – that it’s better in Zip mode, where power delivery is the smoothest. If you’re in Zap or Zoom mode, you will find that the engine bunches up its power quite early in the rev range. And you don’t want that when you’re in very tight moving conditions. Modes alter response and steering weight. Of course, when the road opens up, you’d want to switch to Zap or Zoom mode, which will have the engine breathe freer and feel different in its power delivery. While the Kylaq’s engine is the strongest in the mid-range, the XUV’s mill feels strong throughout. So, right from low revs, it’s more alert and responsive, and even in the mid-range, there is a constant and steady stream of power. You don’t have to work the engine to get the best out of it. Paddle shifters add to the Kylaq's drive experience. The 3XO is quick and fun, but you will miss paddle shifters. Gear shifts via the lever are responsive enough, though. What’s remarkable is the Mahindra engine’s refinement. Even when revved hard, it doesn’t thrum like you’d expect a 3-cylinder unit to. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO fuel efficiency XUV 3XO was more frugal in our testing Kylaq returned a better mileage on the highway, while the XUV 3XO sipped less fuel in the city. Coming to the important topic of fuel efficiency, we put the two cars through our test loops in Mumbai city as well as on the highway. And it’s the XUV that delivered a higher figure of 9.9kpl in town. The SUV’s auto stop/start keeps the engine off for longer durations, which could have helped the economy. The Kylaq managed 8.7kpl in the city, but it did edge past on the highway, delivering 13.3kpl to the XUV 3XO’s 13kpl figure. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO fuel efficiencyFuel efficiencyKylaqXUV 3XOCity (kpl)8.709.89Highway (kpl)13.3613.01 Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO ride comfort and handling Kylaq corners better, but XUV 3XO feels more stable at high speeds Around the bends, the Kylaq feels more engaging. The Kylaq doesn’t get steering modes like the XUV 3XO, and in general, it has a lighter steering wheel, but it’s nice and smooth, and you can have great fun in the corners. You also get the feeling that this chassis could actually take on a larger, more powerful engine, maybe the 1.5 TSI for a Kylaq RS? When cruising on the highway, the Kylaq drives like a bigger car, but over undulations, there is more up-and-down movement than you get in the 3XO. And if you talk specifically in comparison to the 3XO’s ride comfort, the Kylaq is more absorbent at lower speeds, and over bumps and potholes, you’ll sense that there’s a bit more wheel travel as well. XUV 3XO's driving modes noticeably affect steering feel. The XUV 3XO, too, feels fun to drive on a twisty road. Notably, its drive modes also change steering weight progressively. You get a good feeling of control at the steering wheel, but the standout element is the grip that you experience around corners. So, you can carry a lot of speed with a great deal of confidence. At higher speeds, the 3XO feels poised and composed, and you can attribute that to the relatively flatter ride than the Kylaq. On the flip side, the low-speed ride is a bit firmer than the Skoda, but not to the extent of being a dealbreaker. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO price and verdict Both compact SUVs trade blows on the price front They're close in terms of driving experience, but the Mahindra feels like a more complete package. In terms of pricing, the Skoda Kylaq and Mahindra XUV 3XO are about at par for comparable trim levels. The fully loaded XUV 3XO AX7 L featured here is pricey at Rs 15.79 lakh (ex-showroom, Mumbai). But forgo the ADAS, 360-degree camera and electric parking brake, and you can get the AX7, whose Rs 13.99 lakh price tag is identical to that of the top-spec Kylaq Prestige AT. Talking about like-priced variants, there is a bit of give and take in features, but they’re still close. The duo is also close in terms of driving experience, the 3XO being marginally faster, while the Kylaq is more entertaining in its handling and slightly more absorbent in its ride quality. Where the 3XO moves ahead is in its plusher interior, more refined engine and more room for passengers. The advantage in fuel economy also tips the scales in favour of the Mahindra. Keen drivers will enjoy both models, no doubt, but it’s the XUV 3XO that eventually makes you feel like you’ve got more for your money.

    "description": "When the Harley-Davidson Pan America first broke cover, we knew it would shake up the adventure bike market. What we didn’t expect, was that it would become a regular fixture on the custom motorcycle scene. The Dutch workshop Powerbrick was one of the first to show the Pan America’s potential, by turning it into an unapologetic streetfighter with razor-sharp styling. That bike sent our servers into overdrive, earning it the top spot on our annual Top 10 list. But, as shop boss Tim Somers explained at the time, it was never meant to be a one-off. Powerbrick’s first Pan America kicked off the development of a range of plug-and-play parts, under their CNCPT Moto label. After much refinement, those parts are now ready to go—so Tim and his crew have built a pair of jaw-dropping Pan Americas to showcase them.…",

I was hoping they might divert a little more radically from their signature cruiser look, but the Street 500 felt like a less inspired, smaller-displacement, fuel-injected, liquid-cooled vanilla version of an 883 to me. Then, as if Harley had tuned into my gripes, I learned of their plans to bring flat track racing to the masses with intentions of adding the event to the X Games and using the new Street 750 as the platform. At the same time, The Speed Merchant dropped us a line from California to say they were building a tracker-inspired Harley Street 500 to be unveiled at Born Free 6.…",

    "description": "India’s EV market is entering a pivotal phase, with the once-dominant Tata Motors steadily ceding ground to rival carmakers. In June 2025, EV registrations touched 13,033 units—an impressive 78 percent year-on-year jump over June 2024. EV penetration for the month is estimated at around 4 percent, underscoring the growing momentum for electrified mobility, even as the segment still accounts for a small slice of overall PV sales. MG and Mahindra command more than 53 percent of the EV market, a dramatic reversal from a year ago, when Tata alone held the lion’s share.  EV sales in June 2025BrandJune 25 June 24YoY May 25MoM Tata Motors466445902%45991%MG Motor India 39451476167%4054-3%Mahindra2979487512%28335%Hyundai50963708%639-20%BYD46124390%516-11%Kia4116156%3037%Citroen 80238-66%123-35% Tata Motors Sales: 4664 units, YoY growth: 2 percent Tata Motors retained its position as the top-selling brand in June with 4,664 units. However, while volume remained steady, its market share continued to slide, falling to 35.8 percent, a significant drop from 62.7 percent in June 2024. This steep decline signals that newer, more focused rivals now threaten Tata’s first-mover advantage despite a relatively fresh product portfolio with the likes of the Curvv EV and Punch EV. Recently, Tata Motors also launched its flagship Harrier EV, although its impact is yet to reflect in terms of sales. MG Motor India Sales: 3945 units, YoY growth: 167 percent   MG Motor India has emerged as the biggest disruptor. The company recorded sales of 3,945 units in June, marking a 167 percent year-on-year increase. While the ZS EV and Comet laid the groundwork, MG’s recent surge is led by Windsor, its mid-size electric crossover. The Windsor has resonated strongly with the Indian EV buyer, particularly in metro and urban centers. MG now holds a 30.3 percent share of the EV market, narrowing the gap with Tata to less than six percentage points. Mahindra Sales: 2979 units, YoY growth: 512 percent Matching that growth trajectory is Mahindra, which clocked 2,979 EV registrations in June, a staggering 512 percent jump over the same month last year. The company’s born-electric SUVs – the BE 6 and the XEV 9e – has helped it carve a distinct identity in the market. With a growing portfolio of purpose-built electric SUVs and a solid design-technology strategy, Mahindra now holds a 22.9 percent share, emerging as the third strong pillar in India’s high-growth EV space. Hyundai, Kia, Citroen and BYD Other players have delivered mixed results. Hyundai posted 509 units, up sharply from 63 units a year ago, which can be attributed to the Creta Electric. However, Hyundai’s EV sales were down on a monthly basis. Meanwhile, sister brand Kia, despite only having products at the premium end of the market with the EV6 and the EV9, sold 41 units, recording strong YoY (156 percent) and MoM (37 percent) growth. On the back of a robust portfolio now, BYD also posted healthy numbers with sales of 461 units, thereby recording 90 percent YoY growth, although monthly sales were down by 11 percent. Citroen, meanwhile, sold just 80 units of the eC3, recording a considerable 66 percent YoY and 35 percent MoM decline.

With one of the most expansive EV portfolios, BMW recorded sales of 212 units with a whopping 272 percent YoY growth and 15 percent MoM growth. Mercedes, meanwhile, recorded sales of 91 units, mostly concentrated at the top-end of the luxury segment. Mercedes’ sales were nearly double of what they sold last year, but MoM, there was a decline of 4 percent. Meanwhile, Volvo and Audi really struggled with either relevance or scale in India’s value-sensitive landscape. In third spot, Volvo sold 22 units, while Audi sold just 2 units, both brands recording significant YoY and MoM declines.
