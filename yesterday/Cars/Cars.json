    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/from-the-archive/eighties-excess-ferrari-f40-meets-porsche-959",
    "description": "The summer of 1988 played host to the biggest supercar battle of a generation Blockbuster supercar showdowns are rare and always momentous occasions. Typically coming perhaps only once a decade, comparisons of the latest boundary-pushing feats of incredible engineering never fail to excite and inspire. And one of the greatest of all appeared in Autocar in the summer of 1988: Ferrari F40 versus Porsche 959. Despite them appearing at first glance as the most natural of rivals, a closer look quickly revealed fundamental contrasts between what were the two fastest production cars in the world. The mechanically simple F40 weighed merely 1100kg, thanks to innovative use of carbonfibre and Kevlar, and made a stonking 478bhp, whereas the 959 weighed 1450kg and produced 444bhp but gained significant advantages elsewhere by being a technical tour de force. Our test 959 was owned by privateer endurance racer and F1 team owner Walter Brun, who we accompanied to Italy to meet an F40 with the Scuderia’s Gerhard Berger at the wheel. Their attention turned immediately to the F40.  As the final car overseen by Enzo Ferrari himself, it was always going to be a special chapter in Maranello’s history. And thanks to that lightweight construction and a twin-turbocharged V8 engine “with performance characteristics that make others look as flat as a pizza”, it had become the first-ever production car to break the 200mph barrier. Berger praised it as “the best road chassis I have ever driven” and Brun said: “With racing tyres and some fine-tuning, it would easily run at the front of category C2 [the pinnacle of sports car racing].” Enjoy full access to the complete Autocar archive at the magazineshop.com Perhaps surprisingly, the F40 had a performance advantage over the 959 not just in terms of top speed – 201mph versus 197mph – but also through the corners. So much so that it would be about 10sec per lap quicker than its German rival around Ferrari’s Fiorano test track. “It runs fantastically well,” said Berger. “It bites from around 3000rpm and upwards of 3500rpm it really takes off as if the turbos are constantly supplying full boost.” We added: “Beyond 3500rpm, there is such an abundance of power and torque that Berger had power oversteer any time he felt like it.” Indeed, he considered it was “nearly an act of provocation to offer a car with so much power and so light weight to an ordinary driver”. As for the 959, “its two-stage turbocharging system gives it performance that is more typical of a blown engine than the F40’s”, we said. “Up to 4300rpm, only the first turbo puffs into the cylinders of the flat six; above that, the second blower comes in. This makes it feel rather leisurely below 4500rpm. Then it suddenly explodes as it begins to dispense real power.” There was another side to all this, however: “The F40’s advantage is clear when the sky is blue and the Tarmac fairly smooth, but the 959 is a car which permits massive acceleration and deceleration even on wet surfaces, slush or gravel.” You see, while Ferrari had compromised everything else in order to be as light and as fast as possible, Porsche had given its supercar a complex four-wheel drive system, computer-controlled power distribution, self-levelling suspension, power steering and advanced anti-lock brakes, not to mention rear seats within its plush cabin, in an effort to demonstrate a new concept within the world of supercars: everyday usability. We elaborated: “The Italians say they never intended to construct a high-tech cathedral; they simply wanted to build the world’s fastest sports car. They seem to have succeeded. Porsche, on the other hand, wanted to build a car that contained the ultimate in driveline technology and showed how easy and manageable very high power outputs could be made in the hands of any driver in all conditions. Anyone who has driven a 959 in a range of weathers knows that it too has succeeded.” We therefore concluded that the 959 was the winner hands down, the F40 being for special occasions only. Nevertheless, these contrasting personalities showed the world that a supercar could be built in two very different but equally brilliant ways, and there’s no denying both cars fully deserve the prominent places they have since taken in automotive folklore.",

    "description": "Silverstone Festival brings supercars and F1 cars together in August Holiday plans in a flux? Need at least some form of automotive entertainment this summer? We've got you covered Now that you’ve got your used car for the summer, where are you going to take it? Fortunately, the UK is blessed with no end of excuses for a drive, ranging from must-see museums and events to must-tour roads. In recent years, they have been joined by a growing roster of weekend and weekday-evening pub meets and cars-and-coffee gatherings.  A great source of information for these less well-publicised events is carevents.com, on which you can search by date, city and car event. It recently broadened its scope to also include companies offering, for example, supercar hire, karting and circuit experiences. To set you thinking about where you could go this summer, we have compiled a selection of drives, events and destinations to consider. Happy motoring! Days out With institutions including Brooklands, the British Motor Museum and the National Motor Museum to choose from, you’d think car enthusiasts’ appetite for automotive history were sufficiently served, but there are plenty more such places to visit. Among the newest is the Museum of Land Speed near Pendine Sands in South Wales, which tells the story of speed trials there. The Great British Car Journey in Ambergate, Derbyshire, has been open for a few years now and remains an intriguing celebration of British cars with the added attraction of being able to go for drives in some of them. Taunton’s recently opened County Classics Motor Museum is the brainchild of one local enthusiast who has been collecting interesting mainstream cars, most of them British, for years and decided to display them. Also in Somerset, Haynes Motor Museum in Sparkford is a similar but more ambitious concept founded by Mr Haynes Manuals himself. Top events The British Grand Prix (6 July) has to be at the top of your must-see list, but affordable, general-admission race-day tickets are selling out fast.  Don’t worry, though, because there are plenty still available for the Silverstone Festival (22-24 August), an event that promises to be just as exciting as the circuit celebrates 75 years as a Formula 1 championship venue (it was the first back in 1950) with a cavalcade of legendary F1 cars. Admission-only tickets for the Goodwood Festival of Speed (10-13 July) are selling out fast too, so get your skates on. At least there’s the Hagerty Festival of the Unexceptional (26 July), a much more down-to-earth affair for which tickets are still available at reasonable prices. If one of our suggested used cars qualifies as an unexceptional classic, you and it may qualify for a display entry ticket costing just £20.  It’s from the sublime to the ridiculous the following week when it’s the turn of Beaulieu Supercar Weekend (2-3 August) with demonstration runs and arena performance displays. F1 champion Jody Scheckter’s Laverstoke Farm in Hampshire is once again the venue for CarFest (22-24 August), featuring driving displays, track events and test drives. Round off the summer season with your best bib and tucker for a day at Salon Privé at Blenheim Palace (27-31 August) or the Concours of Elegance at Hampton Court Palace (5-7 September). Great roads Starting in the south, there’s the 70-mile long Atlantic Highway section of the A39 from Barnstaple to Newquay, and in Dorset the 18-mile Jurassic Coast Road following the B3157 from Weymouth to Bridport (or peel off and continue to Lyme Regis). For south-east drivers, the A272 Winchester to Uckfield is a good road with a recently opened Caffeine \u0026 Machine petrolhead stop where it crosses the A32. Turning northwards, another is the A429 Fosse Way linking the south (Cirencester) with the Midlands (Leicester). In the west, the recently created Pembrokeshire Coast Road follows the Wales coastline for 200 miles from Amroth to Dale. Alternatively, spend a day enjoying the roads in the Brecon Beacons. The Brecon to Llandovery section of the A40 followed by the A4069 across the Black Mountains to Brynamman and back to Brecon via Penderyn makes a good circuit. In the north-east, you’re spoiled for choice with roads such as the A171 Scarborough to Whitby, returning via the A169 to Pickering and then the A170. In Scotland, well, where to start? How about the A710 Moffat to Edinburgh or the A710/711 Solway Coast road?",

It’s an enchanting blend of retro charm and modern style, and it’s high on the list of exotic machines that would be parked in the mythical Bike EXIF garage (or living room). MV Agusta has been making subtle upgrades to the Superveloce ever since it launched. Now, they’ve unveiled the most exclusive version of it yet—the 2025 MV Agusta Superveloce 1000 Ago. Just look at it. MV Agusta and Giacomo Agostini go together like Coke and vanilla ice cream; each is great on its own, but together, they’re unstoppable.

    "description": "Explosive performance at an accessible price – these words instantly bring a certain orange machine to mind. Since 2013, the KTM 390 Duke has dominated its class, and every single rival that has gone up against the Duke has retreated with its tail tucked between its legs. But today, the Duke will have to deal with its toughest challenge yet posed by the Aprilia Tuono 457. KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 design and ergonomics Both have sharp designs and can feel tight for taller folks With some bikes, just a glance is enough to tell you what they are meant to do, and the designs of these two machines are true to their function. Neither is classically good-looking, and both are aggressively styled, although in its latest avatar, the 390 might be too aggressive for some.  The rider’s triangle is the first difference you’ll notice, and while both are reasonably comfortable, on the Aprilia, there is a bit of a forward reach to the handlebar, whereas you’re almost bolt upright on the KTM. Over bad roads, this will be felt in the lower back. With their 800mm perches, these bikes will be welcoming for shorter riders but feel cramped for taller ones.  Both bikes are a little tight for larger and heavier riders. At 5’11”, I just about fit on both these machines, but taller riders should look elsewhere. The Duke can be had with an accessory tall seat, raising its perch to 820mm, which will liberate some knee room for taller riders. The optional comfort seat on the Tuono keeps the same height as the stock unit. Neither is geared toward all-out comfort, and that’s par for the course.  KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 quality and features Duke has larger number of useful features and better quality all across Modern-day KTMs have made huge strides when it comes to the quality front, and that is clearly visible here. The Tuono 457, with its aluminium chassis, looks great, but crucial areas, such as the cheap-feeling key, the more basic levers and an ugly misaligned panel on the headlight surround, just feel like a step down from the KTM. Fun fact: the adjustable brake lever on the Tuono is a Rs 5,500 accessory (!) and appears to be the exact same unit as the one on the Gen 2 390 Duke that sells for under Rs 1,000. The 390 Duke now also gets cruise control. Another facet where the Duke is ahead of the Tuono is the features (and bragging rights) department. Its suspension has damping adjustability, the bidirectional quickshifter is standard, it comes with a cornering anti-lock braking system (ABS) and traction control (TC), and the latest model even has cruise control. The Tuono, with its three riding modes, switchable ABS and TC and preload-adjustable front suspension, has a good level of kit, unlike the contender from the tuning fork brand. As for the Aprilia’s bidirectional quickshifter? A cool Rs 20,000 for that.  KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 handling Both are superb handlers and will put a big smile on your face However, you don’t ride a bike’s build quality or features, so I’ll stop rambling about that and start raving about how these things behave on the road. Both take very different approaches to their chassis – the KTM uses a steel trellis, while the Aprilia has an aluminium perimeter frame (the only one in this class to do so). Predictably, their behaviour on the side of the tyre is markedly different, but both are almost equally fast in the real world.  Both machines are fast, but they go about their business quite differently. It might sound cliché, but the Duke feels a lot like a supermoto, and the Tuono feels a lot like a sportbike with a taller handlebar in the corners. They handle with a different feeling: the Duke prioritises lightness and reactivity, while the Aprilia feels agile but also beautifully composed. That said, both handle very well, and you’ll have a great time on either machine, whether on road or track.  Key specificationsAprilia Tuono 457KTM 390 DukeKerb Weight175kg168.3kgSeat height800mm800mmGround clearance 150mm170mmFuel tank capacity12.7 litres15 litresWheelbase1360mm1357mm KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 ride comfort Duke's suspension more pliant; Tuono's brake fade issue an annoyance While chasing twisty ribbons of tarmac is what owners will dream of doing with these bikes, the reality is they will be used for commuting more often. Mumbai’s lumpy roads are a proper test of a bike’s suspension, and here, the Duke’s sophisticated setup will be worth its weight in gold. The bike feels a lot more absorptive while going over bumps, without sacrificing poise when you turn up the wick.   Both have taut suspension setups but KTM feels much more pliant than the Aprilia. In comparison, the Tuono’s suspension system, carried over unchanged from the RS 457, feels much stiffer, and you will feel more of the bumps. The brake-fade issue under repeated hard use on the 457s is another sore point, and while it isn’t a very difficult fix, Aprilia should’ve ironed it out by now. Especially since customers have shared that certain dealerships say warranties will be cancelled when brake master cylinders are upgraded.  EngineAprilia Tuono 457KTM 390 DukeEngine457cc, twin-cyl, liquid-cooled399cc, single-cyl, liquid-cooledPower47.6hp at 9,400rpm46hp at 8,500rpmPower-to-weight ratio272hp/tonne273.33hp/tonneTorque43.5Nm at 6,400rpm39Nm at 6,400rpm KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 engine and performance Aprilia's engine is the star of the show, KTM is quick but not as characterful So far, it’s neck and neck, but one area where the Tuono scores a massive victory is the engine. The twin-cylinder mill is smooth, brimming with character, and makes all the right sounds. Its strong low-end and mid-range also mean you needn’t frantically work the gearbox, and it also pops nice power wheelies. In outright performance, the Tuono is quicker in the 0-100kph sprint by just 0.3 seconds, but its engine’s effortless grunt is more apparent in the roll-on acceleration tests.  The Tuono’s engine is a peach. Hopping onto the KTM after the Aprilia will make you realise you need to work the gearbox more and give the engine revs to make quick progress. You’ll also feel a more pronounced buzz, especially in the handlebar. However, the Duke’s refinement levels are respectable for a single-cylinder engine of this size with this level of performance. That said, the excitable hooligan nature of the KTM is great fun, if that’s the riding experience you’re after.  PerformanceAprilia Tuono 457KTM 390 DukeAcceleration 0-60kph2.17s2.21s0-100kph4.88s5.21sRoll-on acceleration20-50kph1.73s1.87s30-70kph2.83s3.19s50-80kph2.68s3.22sBraking60-0kph (in metres)16.3516.52 KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 price and verdict Tuono is an impressive machine let down by pressing issues PriceAprilia Tuono 457KTM 390 DukePrice (ex-showroom, Delhi)Rs 3.95 lakhRs 2.97 lakh All that back and forth now means I need to tell you which bike is the winner. The Tuono 457 feels very special to ride, but it’s nearly Rs 1.50 lakh more (on-road, Mumbai) with the accessory quickshifter installed. The engine and sublime handling are two very big factors to get one, and this motorcycle won’t be as common a sight on our roads as the Duke. There are buyers out there for whom the extra Rs 1.5 lakh will be justified because the Tuono feels like a scaled-down big bike, which is a very special feeling.  Brake-fade issue continues on Aprilia 457s. However, in the last couple of months, several customers have reported varied and significant engine reliability issues. Aprilia India recently attributed these issues to unauthorised modifications and/or irregular service and says that it has addressed the few genuine cases. Whether the issues are fully addressed is something only time can tell.  Beyond that, there is no escaping the fact that the 390 Duke has a much more accessible price, more features and better ride comfort, and it can be nearly as fast as the Tuono. There were some isolated engine incidents at the beginning, but Bajaj swiftly addressed them, and the bike has been around for long enough that there are no significant reliability concerns. All this is why the KTM 390 Duke will continue to reign in this segment. Also See: KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 comparison video",

    "description": "Some motorcycles have a tendency to slip under the average buyer’s radar, and the Suzuki GSX-8R is a fine example. It probably won’t be the first pick when you ask someone to think of a middleweight sportbike, and that’s fair because this bike packs a parallel-twin engine in a segment with more powerful inline-3 and 4-cylinder motors. But unassuming things can often surprise you with how good they can be, and that’s exactly what the 8R did at our annual track day a couple of months back. Not only did it set the quickest lap time (to be fair, it was also the most powerful bike there), but it also proved to be surprisingly sweet and engaging to ride. Suzuki GSX8R engine sound and performance - 8/10 Twin-cyl motor is torquey and smooth but isn't the most exciting nor the best sounding in its class As it turns out, this character translates beautifully to the street as well. While the 776cc parallel twin produces the least power in this segment, the torque figure is actually the highest. Its 78Nm is, in fact, much closer to the Triumph Street Triple 765 RS than it is to the Daytona 660, which is this bike’s immediate rival. That results in a wonderfully strong pull from as low as 3,000rpm, and effortless performance is the name of the game.   The 776cc parallel twin is a good engine, but it lacks the sound and top-end excitement you’ll find with rivals that have 3- or 4-cylinder motors. Switching between the three riding modes lets you experience a very mellow throttle response in C mode or a sharp, quick-throttle feel in A mode, where the torque hit arrives with a solid kick. I found that B mode offers a nice middle ground between the two, but regardless of which you choose, the 8R will propel you to triple-digit speeds with complete ease and no need for dramatic high revs.  That’s not to say that this is a slow motorcycle, and with 82hp, it will blast past 150kph the way most quick Indian bikes would get to 100. But there’s also no discounting the fact that it has sacrificed some of the exciting, zingy top-end performance of its multi-cylinder rivals in exchange for the low-end usability. However, the bigger loss for many enthusiasts will be the sound or relative lack of it. It doesn't sound as nice nor has the same top-end rush as its multi-cylindered rivals. This is a 270-degree parallel twin, and it does have that typically deep and rumbling sound, but it’s also quite muted and not very exciting. For reference, Aprilia’s new 457 parallel twin sounds a lot louder and more thrilling, as we discovered when the Suzuki and the Tuono 457 were parked side by side on our track day. If you’re someone who wants a loud and flashy sportbike, this won’t be for you. EngineSuzuki GSX-8REngine776cc, twin-cylinder, liquid-cooledPower82hp at 8500rpm Torque78Nm at 6800rpmGearbox 6-speed Suzuki GSX8R ride and handling - 8/10  It is poised when going through a corner yet comfortable over broken roads But a subtle nature doesn’t mean an unimpressive one because this bike is surprisingly good fun to ride. On the track, it proved to be easy, unintimidating and thoroughly well-behaved, responding obediently to your every request. This clearly isn’t a bike made for the racetrack, but it performed there far better than most would expect. The only limiting factors for Rajini when he was pushing for a fast lap were that the footpegs were scraping and that the ABS was too intrusive. Comfort is aided by a wide and accommodating rider seat. On the street, neither of those ended up being an issue, but the bike retained that sweet and friendly feel. At 205kg, the 8R is in the ballpark for the segment, and you will feel the weight if you plan to go attacking some very tight and twisty interior roads. But give the bike some breathing room on a wider road, and you’ll discover a rewarding handler that settles into a wonderful flow with the road.  Tall clip-on bars result in a reasonably comfy riding position. The 8R feels settled on its suspension and encourages you to push to quite a high pace. Part of this deep-seated sense of confidence comes through the tubular steel chassis and the non-adjustable but well-set Showa suspension. It’s not excessively plush like the Daytona 660, which means it isn’t as comfy on badly made concrete roads (although it really isn’t bad and is far from punishing), but you reap the rewards when the pace is raised on a good stretch of tarmac.  Key SpecsSuzuki GSX-8RKerb Weight205kgSeat Height810mmFuel Capacity14 litresGround Clearance145mmWheelbase1465mm Suzuki GSX8R comfort, build quality and features - 8/10 Well-built, comfortable and has everything you need, can drink fuel quite quickly if you ride it hard   On the other hand, the riding position is committed enough to remind you that you’re on a fair, sporty motorcycle but also relatively kind on the wrists, hips and knees. It’s a similar story with the brakes. The initial bite is almost disappointing, but once you start using them for a while, you realise there’s sufficient power and feel, and it matches the nature of the bike. Brakes feel dull at first but work well. I also like how Suzuki has given its 5-inch TFT display a simple, easy-to-use layout. You almost never have to enter any menus. All the functions you’d need, like changing the ride modes, the TC levels (four, including off), or just switching between trip information, can be done from the main home screen display. Overall quality levels are also very nice, and like most imported Japanese bikes, everything feels solid and has a pleasing, built-to-last feel. TFT display has a clean layout and is very easy to use. There aren’t many outright negatives, and the few complaints are that the bike gets quite hot in heavy traffic – there are no nasty hot air blasts, but there is quite a bit of radiated heat that you need to deal with. What I found to be more of an issue was that it seems to empty its 14-litre tank quite quickly, and you won’t go much further than 150-170km on a tankful if you have a throttle-happy right wrist.   A subtle nature doesn’t mean an unimpressive one, and the 8R is surprisingly good fun. Suzuki GSX8R price and verdict - 8/10 It is the most affordable and least flashy machine in its class At Rs 9.25 lakh, ex-showroom, the GSX-8R costs about Rs 50,000 less than the Daytona and Rs 75,000 less than Honda’s revered CBR650R. The price savings are nice but not big enough to be a reason to pick this bike over those two. For that, I’d say that this is the thinking person’s middleweight sportbike – the bike for someone who likes flying under the radar.  The 8R is a lovely but understated machine, which won't make it stand out in its class. And with that in mind, Suzuki may have a bit of a tough time on their hands. That’s because this is the segment where someone is typically buying their first sportbike, and subtlety is usually not at the top of the wish list. But for those who want that more understated experience, the GSX-8R is a great choice.  Also See: Suzuki GSX8R video review",

    "description": "Dear reader, I’m overjoyed to announce I’ve recently become a dad. Life has changed in so many ways (I’ve never valued a power nap as much as I do now!), and to an extent, so has the way I look at cars. I have become ever more mindful of the smallest of things that could make my little one’s car rides comfier. ISOFIX child seat anchors are a bit tough to find underneath the seat cushioning. Of course, step one was to get the child seat in order. The Hyundai Creta N Line I’ve been using gets ISOFIX child seat anchors to lock the seat firmly in place, but they’re tucked behind the cushioning and need a bit of poking around to locate. This is not a biggie for an average user who’d keep the seat in place for months at a stretch, but I have to keep removing and re-attaching the seat whenever there’s a new car I have to test. Thankfully, my daughter has taken well to the car seat and, as my wife reports from the back seat, enjoys her drives. Option to pre-cool the Creta using the phone app put to full use over the summer. We’ve had a baking summer in Mumbai, and my kiddo, understandably, hates being strapped onto her seat in a hot car. The solution has come in the form of remote pre-cooling. To be honest, I’d never used connected car features beyond a review evaluation, but today, setting up the car in advance with the tap of a few buttons on my phone screen is part of my SOP. The option to remotely start the vehicle and have the air conditioning run has been an absolute boon. Hyundai’s BlueLink app is easy to use, and I’ve not had challenges with the network, which is known to be an issue with many eSIM-based connected services. Our kiddo loves looking through the panoramic sunroof. Of course, we’ve had our share of crying spells on the go. Bumper-to-bumper traffic with an irate baby is not fun, I can tell you that. On one such drive, retracting the cover for the panoramic sunroof proved to be an Eureka moment. The newfound view of the world above immediately distracted my daughter, making the remainder of the journey a lot, well, calmer. Something tells me kids will love the Mahindra BE 6 and XEV 9e’s trippy, colour-changing roof lighting. The Creta N Line, in general, has proved to be good transport for the family, but I do wish there was more luggage room. I never realised a stroller occupied so much space! Fuel economy figure firmly in the single digits in chock-a-block city driving. More efficiency would be welcome, too. Fuel economy has been in the 7-8kpl range, but to be fair, my bumper-to-bumper slog never gives cars a chance to breathe free. Of the other things, there’s an irritating plasticky creak from the centre console every time a driver’s leg presses against it. This is something we experienced on our Creta IVT, too. Centre console lets out creaks whenever the driver’s leg rests on it. I have ambitious plans for a road trip over the monsoons. It’ll be a full house with my wife, baby, doggo and myself in the car. Time to dig deeper into the Creta’s box of tricks!

    "description": "Even though the Indian luxury car market saw tepid growth, the segment remains dynamic, driven by premium SUVs, expanding EV portfolios and greater localisation. The top five players in the segment, namely Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover, Audi and Volvo, added 48,849 units to the total sales tally in FY25, a minuscule 0.55 percent year-on-year growth compared to FY24. Mercedes-Benz 4 percent year-on-year growth   E-Class LWB was brand’s bestseller The E-Class LWB was the brand's bestseller in FY2025. Mercedes-Benz retained its top position in the luxury car market, with sales growing 4 percent year on year. A major contributor to this performance was the growing demand for its top-end vehicle (TEV) portfolio, comprising models priced above Rs 1.5 crore. Vehicles such as the S-Class, the Maybach range and the G-Class continued to enjoy strong demand, leading to a 34 percent growth in the TEV segment alone. Notably, on account of increasing demand, most of these top-end models command a waiting period, which stretches into many months, a reflection of robust demand and limited supply.  Electrification is also beginning to play a role in Mercedes’ India strategy. The EQS SUV, Maybach EQS, and the electric G-Class have helped push the share of electrics in Mercedes-Benz’s India sales to 7 percent in FY25. The EQS SUV, now locally assembled, emerged as the bestselling electric vehicle for the brand, outperforming smaller and more affordable models like the EQA, EQB, and EQE SUVs. The brand’s overall volumes continue to be driven by the core line-up, which includes the E-Class LWB, GLC and GLE. BMW 4 percent year-on-year growth   Mercedes leads the luxury PV segment, while BMW sells the most luxury EVs. BMW secured the second spot in the luxury segment, also recording a 4 percent growth in FY25. The 3 Series Long Wheelbase and the new 5 Series Long Wheelbase were the bestselling sedans, while the X1 and X5 were the bestselling SUVs for the brand.  The locally assembled iX1, launched in January 2025, received a positive market response, especially due to its sub-Rs 50 lakh pricing, positioning it as a compelling option in the entry-luxury EV space. The iX1, along with the uber-premium i7 sedan and iX SUV, comprised 10 percent of BMW’s total sales, making it the top-performing brand in the luxury electric vehicle space. The Mini brand, which operates under BMW Group India, contributed around 4 percent to BMW’s total volumes, with the Cooper S hot hatchback continuing to enjoy a niche but loyal following. Jaguar Land Rover 40 percent year-on-year growth Defender was highest selling model The Defender saw 90 percent year-on-year growth in FY2025. Impressively, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) beat Audi in sales, securing third spot. Jaguar Land Rover sold 6,183 units in FY2025, recording a whopping 40 percent year-on-year growth, and emerging as the fastest-growing luxury car brand in FY25. The key growth driver was the Defender SUV, which saw a staggering 90 percent increase in sales, establishing itself as the brand’s bestseller. JLR’s strategy to locally assemble high-demand models also paid dividends. The sales of the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport, both now assembled in India, rose 72 percent and 42 percent, respectively. The brand’s focus on the SUV segment and successful localisation has helped significantly enhance its market presence. Audi 15 percent year-on-year degrowth  JLR’s growth seems to have come at the expense of Audi, which slipped a rank to number four and reportedly sold 5,993 units in FY25, recording de-growth of 15 percent compared to last year. The slump is, no doubt, attributed to the lack of diesels, an ageing portfolio and a slow new product rollout. Audi will have to soldier on with its core products like the A4, Q3, Q7 and Q8. Volvo 18.60 percent year-on-year degrowth  At fifth place in the luxury car market, sales of Volvo India fell by 18.60 percent compared to FY24. The brand’s limited and ageing product portfolio is beginning to take its toll. Furthermore, Volvo’s network is much smaller than other luxury carmakers mentioned above. Staying true to its global sustainability commitments, the brand is steadily transitioning towards electrification. In FY25, one in every three Volvos sold in India was an electric vehicle. The upcoming EX30, a compact electric crossover, is expected to be a key growth catalyst in FY26, positioned below the XC40 Recharge to attract a wider customer base. Lexus India 19 percent year-on-year growth NX SUV has been company’s best-seller Although Lexus India hasn’t given out a specific sales number, the company said it recorded a robust 19 percent on-year growth in FY2025. Meanwhile, Q4 also saw a strong 17 percent growth over the same period in the previous financial year, driven primarily by the Lexus NX SUV. The company also said the LM MPV has been in strong demand. Meanwhile, in March 2025, Lexus India recorded its highest-ever monthly sales to date, primarily on the back of the NX and RX SUVs.

    "description": "Mahindra Racing secured its second podium finish of the 2025 Formula E season, with Edoardo Mortara finishing second at the Jakarta E-Prix. Mortara narrowly missed out on victory to Cupra Kiro’s Dan Ticktum, who scored his first-ever Formula E win. Andretti’s Nico Mueller completed the podium in third place. The race delivered plenty of drama, with a dusty track described by some drivers as a “wet race without water”. Ticktum wins, 0.371 sec ahead of Mortara Mueller on podium for Andretti Rowland extends Formula E championship lead Ticktum scores first Formula E win Cupra Kiro’s first Formula E win since Season 1 Starting from fifth on the grid, Ticktum initially dropped down the order after the first round of Attack Mode. But he clawed his way up the field and soon found himself in contention for victory after Jake Dennis and Nyck de Vries’ retirements. He had to fend off Mortara in the closing laps, though. Ticktum was helped by the timing of the final Full Course Yellow, which came just as Mortara took his final Attack Mode activation, leaving the Mahindra driver unable to use the power boost and four-wheel drive that came with it. Ticktum successfully kept Mortara at bay to secure his first Formula E win after 60 race starts in the championship. This is also Cupra Kiro’s first race win since the inaugural 2014-15 season, when the team competed under the name NEXTEV. Addressing the media after the race, Ticktum said, “I’ve got a lot of hate from people over the years – people with short-term memory issues forgetting that I’ve won a fair few things on my way up the ladder.” “I think the first three seasons in Formula E were very tough. It was difficult to remain motivated, but this season is pretty much as good as I could have hoped for,” he added. “We definitely struggled at the start; hit the ground running to adapt to all the new systems and the new powertrain, and the team has done a remarkable job. Specially since Miami, I think the rate of improvement has been very good.” Mahindra on podium at Jakarta De Vries out of race after contact with Dennis The Jakarta E-Prix started off as a strong round for Mahindra, with both of its drivers making it through to the duels in qualifying. Mortara’s P2 finish hands the team it’s second podium result of the season so far, following de Vries’ second-place finish at Monaco. However, it was bitter-sweet result for Mortara. While he did secure his best result of the season so far, he also admitted he was disappointed for the team. “I think we should have got both cars on the podium,” he said. “The race was lucky and unlucky [for me]. For the second Attack Mode, yes I was in front of Dan (Ticktum) and I think if we had no interruptions, probably we had a good chance of finishing in front of him. But we’re also very lucky that the good guys in front of us stopped.” De Vries, meanwhile, was locked in battle for victory with Jake Dennis early on. On lap 23, the Mahindra driver pulled alongside Dennis and was ahead by just a whisker, but moved to the right and made contact with Dennis’ Andretti car in the process. Stewards handed de Vries a 10-second penalty for the incident, but none of it would matter with both Dennis and de Vries dropping out. Dennis ended up P17 after an issue with releasing the Full Course Yellow limiter, while de Vries retired due to a technical issue. Mortara’s podium result was enough for Mahindra to hold on to fifth place in the teams’ championship, just six points behind McLaren. Reflecting on the race, Mahindra Racing team principal Frederic Bertrand said, “For us it was a super well-executed race on Edo’s [Mortara] side for sure. Also on Nyck’s side, [but there was a] small mistake at one moment and a small issue for him.” He added, “It was a proud moment for us to see two Mahindra’s leading the race; maybe it could have been a one-two at the end, to be honest. But we are super happy and proud because this is our second podium – first podium for Edo, which should give him an additional level of confidence for Berlin.” 2025 Formula E championship standings Nissan, Oliver Rowland extend lead Mueller ended up finishing third, gaining 10 places from his starting position. Antonio Felix da Costa finished fourth, followed by Nick Cassidy and the McLaren duo of Taylor Barnard and Sam Bird. Envision Racing teammates Sebastian Buemi and Robin Frijns finished P8 and P9, respectively. After a disappointing qualifying performance, championship leader Oliver Rowland made some good progress in the race. But he was handed a 5-second penalty for causing a collision with Max Guenther, dropping him to 10th place. Despite scoring just one point at Jakarta, Rowland has managed to extend his championship lead to 69 points over Pascal Wehrlein, who finished just outside the top 10 in P11. Da Costa is third overall, just three points behind his Porsche teammate.
