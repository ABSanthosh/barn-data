    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-look-toyota-aygo-x-gains-74mpg-hybrid-drops-manual",
    "description": "Yaris engine transplant slashes city car's emissions to a claimed 86g/km Toyota has given the Aygo X an aggressive new look and a hybrid powertrain that is claimed to emit the least CO2 of any non-plug-in car in Europe. The brand’s smallest and most affordable car has adopted the same 1.5-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain that is used in the larger Yaris, sending up to 114bhp through the front wheels.  This is enough to send the Aygo X from 0-62mph in less than 10sec – a significant improvement on the previous 14.9sec. And, product manager Cesar Romero told Autocar, it will yield fuel efficiency in excess of 74mpg, pending official WLTP testing. The existing 71bhp 1.0-litre three-pot, which traces its lineage back to the original Aygo of two decades ago, is being removed from the line-up, and the option of a manual gearbox goes with it; the Aygo X is now fitted with the Yaris’s CVT-like epicyclic automatic as standard. In addition to the much-improved performance of the hybrid, two key motivators for the older lump’s removal from the line-up are the UK’s zero-emission vehicle mandate and fleet CO2 emissions targets. The ZEV mandate contains a provision that allows car manufacturers to convert reductions in their total CO2 outputs into de facto ‘sales’ of electric cars, giving them extra flexibility to meet EV sales targets. Every 167g/km of CO2 cut from a firm’s total output in any given year can be converted into one ZEV ‘sale’, meaning they have to sell one less electric car to meet compliance targets – or they can sell an extra petrol, diesel or hybrid car within their limit. This is particularly relevant for the Aygo. It is one of Toyota’s best-selling models in the UK, and the new hybrid system emits significantly less CO2 than the previous petrol engine. It’s rated at 86g/km, a reduction of 23g. For reference, the rival MG 3 Hybrid+ emits 100g/km. Autocar understands that Toyota sold some 14,000 examples of the city car in the UK last year. Had those all been the new hybrid, Toyota would have been able to sell in excess of 2000 additional ICE cars while remaining within its limit. Separately from the ZEV mandate, such a significant reduction would have given Toyota crucial leeway in its fleet emissions targets: it would have offset the total output of nearly 1600 GR Yarises (rated at 215g/km) or 1400 Land Cruisers (240g/km). The uprated powertrain will, however, bring an increase in cost. Toyota has yet to confirm numbers, but Romero said: \"What we're targeting is, especially on a monthly payment, the total cost of ownership. Fuel consumption of the vehicle will be much lower than for the current car, thanks to the hybrid powertrain. We expect the step [in overall costs] not to be so big.\" For reference, the current pure-petrol Aygo X starts at £16,485, while the Yaris opens at £23,445. Inside, the new Aygo X features a series of subtle changes. The outgoing car’s analogue speedometer and rev counter are swapped for a small digital instrument screen, and there is now a pair of USB-C ports below the climate control panel. An infrared sensor is now mounted on the steering rack (for the EU-mandated driver attention monitoring system) and there are updated buttons on the steering wheel for the speed limit-warning and lane-keeping systems.  Toyota has also added more sound deadening around the dashboard and under the bonnet, and the exhaust has been reworked to improve refinement.  Higher trim levels will get yet more soundproofing and thicker window glass. The first examples of the new Aygo X are due in the UK early next year. New GR Sport trim brings warm-hatch appeal The new GR Sport trim (pictured above) aims to imbue the sensible Aygo X with more dynamic appeal, bringing with it a stiffer chassis and quicker steering. A full-fat GR model isn’t planned, however; Toyota says the new hybrid powertrain’s 114bhp – yielding a power-to-weight ratio similar to that of the old VW Up GTI and Fiat Panda 100HP – is sufficient to make it fun to drive.",

    "description": "Chinese firm Great Wall Motor follows up Ora electric supermini with mid-sized hybrid crossover The Haval Jolion Pro is now on sale in the UK – which will probably come as a surprise to you, so quietly has this Chinese brand arrived. To be fair, it isn’t technically a brand here (unlike in Australia, where incredibly it outsold Volkswagen in 2024). Instead, it’s a sub-brand of GWM, like Ora, which makes the 03 electric supermini – previously known in infamy as the Funky Cat.So to be clear, GWM is the brand, and Ora and Haval models are set to be joined in UK showrooms by more of their Chinese siblings in due course. All went quiet on the Wey front long ago, but perhaps you might fancy a Tank or a Poer…?Yeah, GWM’s marketing strategy is confused. Or maybe the blame for that lies with International Motors, the Brummie firm that also handles UK imports for Isuzu, Subaru and Xpeng.But either way, we’re here to find out whether the Jolion Pro is a car that can speak for itself.",

We take a closer look at it, along with the BMW Concept RR superbike and an Akira-inspired electric motorcycle. Royal Enfield Bear 650 by Fuel Motorcycles The Royal Enfield Bear 650 has been a home run for the Indian company. A scrambler-ized version of their popular Interceptor 650, it scores high on both specs and style, with a delicious set of liveries on offer. The platform is ripe for customization, too. Royal Enfield recently handed one to Fuel Motorcycles to see what a major custom house could do with it, and the Spanish outfit knocked it out of the park.…",

    "description": "The Ducati Scrambler 1100 is not long for this world. Rather than update its aging engine (originally borrowed from the Monster 1100) to meet ever-stricter European emissions regulations, Ducati is dropping it from its portfolio altogether. The odds were stacked against the Ducati Scrambler 1100 from the get-go. It offers less power than most of its competitors for the same, or more, money. And the fact that it inherited the goofy ‘Scrambler’ moniker from the more established Ducati Scrambler 800 when it barely resembles one, hasn’t helped. As far as we’re concerned, the Scrambler 1100 got a raw deal. It has a lot going for it in the looks department, its air-cooled mill feels wonderfully retro, and it’s a delight to ride.…",

    "description": "This 1949 Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 is one of approximately 458 Super Sports built between 1939 and 1951 and is among a reported 63 examples of the SS variant clothed in Pinin Farina cabriolet bodywork during post-war production. Chassis 915756 is said to have left the factory in March 1949 before receiving its bodywork and being sold new in October 1950 in Lugano, Switzerland. The car later underwent a refurbishment between 1990 and 2010 and was purchased by the owning dealer in 2024. Finished in black over tan leather, it is powered by a replacement Super Sport 2,443cc DOHC inline-six that breathes through triple Weber carburetors and is mated to a column-shifted four-speed manual transmission. Additional features include chrome 17” wire wheels, hydraulic drum brakes, four-wheel independent suspension, and a beige convertible top.

    "description": "The Range Rover SV Masara Edition has been launched in India, with prices starting at Rs4.99 crore (ex-showroom). We reported on this a few days ago, and this edition draws inspiration from the sapphires found in the Himalayan region, making it the second India-inspired Range Rover after the Ranthambore Edition. Limited to just 12 units worldwide Features the SV Signature Suite package Finished in exclusive Deep Satin Blue paint Range Rover SV Masara Edition exterior  Bespoke paint will not feature on any other Range Rover model This special edition is based on the long-wheelbase version of the Range Rover SV and is finished in a unique shade of ‘Deep Satin Blue’ paint. According to the company, this colour has been specially formulated for this limited run of 12 units and will not be used on any other Range Rover model, in order to maintain exclusivity. The blue hue pays homage to the sapphires found in the Indian mountain region and is complemented by bronze and chrome highlights, which also extend to the 23-inch alloy wheels. Range Rover SV Masara Edition interior and features Comes standard with the SV Suite package The subtle luxury theme continues inside, with the cabin finished in Liberty Blue and Perlino leather. The seats are embroidered, and additional chrome accents enhance the premium feel. To emphasise the exclusivity of the model, the door sill plates are branded with ‘Masara Edition’ and ‘1 of 12’. The luxury SUV comes as standard with the SV Signature Suite, which includes a powered table, a refrigerated compartment, and bespoke glassware. As it's based on the SV trim, it comes fully equipped with features such as air suspension, ADAS, panoramic roof, and powered seats with heating, cooling, and massage functions, among others.

    "description": "Kia has introduced the third model year update for its all-electric EV9 SUV flagship in the US. In addition to improved range for select 2026 EV9 variants, a new Nightfall Edition featuring both exterior and interior, and performance upgrades is also on offer.  Kia EV9 Nightfall Edition features a Boost mode for extra torque output The electric SUV is sold in four variants in the US; India gets only the fully-loaded GT-Line trim 2026 Kia EV9 range details Up to 16.1km range added While the Kia EV9 in India is available only in the top-spec GT-Line, it's also sold in Land, Wind, Light LR and Light SR trims in America. Of these, the updated EV9 GT-Line sees the biggest improvement in range, up 16.1km to 451km (brand estimated; the official US EPA test cycle figure may vary). For reference, Kia claims a 561km range with the EV9 on the Indian ARAI test cycle. The Land and Wind variants note a 4.82km jump at 455km, while the Light LR settles with a tiny 1.6km jump at 491km. The Light SR variant comes with a 76.1kWh battery pack, whereas, the rest get a 99.8kWh unit. 2026 Kia EV9 Nightfall Edition Blacked-out exterior bits, Boost mode adds 100Nm torque Exclusive to the second-from-top EV9 Land variant, the all-new Nightfall Edition applies a black treatment to the 20-inch wheels and exterior badges. Despite the dark-themed bits, this isn't a usual 'Black Edition' we are used to seeing in India as it adds a Roadrider Brown colour instead of black. As for the interior, the black theme extends to the dashboard, and both the six and seven-seater EV9 models get Nightfall Edition-specific stitching patterns. The Nightfall Edition also has a Boost mode which increases the EV9 Land trim's torque by 100Nm to 700Nm, matching the GT-Line top model's torque output.

    "description": "The TVS iQube has routinely been among the top-selling electric scooters since its launch in 2020, and the very first one came with a 2.2kWh battery. Subsequently, TVS nixed that version and introduced newer variants with bigger batteries, but with ever-increasing inflation leading to larger price tags and a government subsidy that’s all but gone, TVS reintroduced the 2.2kWh option last year. It is now the new entry-level iQube and took over that role from the 3.4kWh variant. But is this 2.2kWh variant a genuinely usable scooter that retains the iQube’s strong points, or is it hamstrung in some way or another like most other budget-friendly e-scooters? After having ridden it extensively for a week, we have an answer. TVS iQube 2.2 design and features (8/10) Staid design and no groundbreaking features, but everything works wonderfully The iQube’s rather innocuous, boxy design hasn’t changed in the last five years, and if one passes you on the road, you’ll likely not give it a second look. All that notwithstanding, what is more pertinent here is that unlike other budget-friendly electric scooters, the iQube’s 2.2 variant doesn’t cheap out in terms of features or usability. It has a large 30-litre boot, a park assist function, a reasonably fast 650W charger, a handy brake-lock clasp, a colour TFT display, a 75kph top speed and even a front disc brake. Most of these features are also seen on the higher variants, so aside from the smaller battery and its lower range, from an end-user perspective, you don’t really get a lot less for your money. The standard 650W charger is quite compact and tops up the battery reasonably quickly. Addressing the boot for just a minute before we move on, the 30-litre unit is slightly smaller than the 32-litre unit on all the other variants. And while that’s still pretty spacious, it is rather shallow, so fitting tall items inside may prove to be a challenge. 30-litre boot on the 2.2 is slightly smaller than the other variants. It’s spacious enough but not very deep. There are a few areas where TVS can polish the iQube even further. For starters, it really should have a multi-function ignition key slot, just like the TVS Jupiter does. Opening the boot via its dedicated key slot is a more cumbersome process than it needs to be, especially if you’ve got your hands full with a bag of groceries or something of the sort. Another little irritant is that if you use the Park Assist function (which can take you both forward and backwards), once you’re done, the motor shuts off, and you again need to press the start button and the brake lever to switch it on once more. The iQube’s charger should also lock into place (like the Ather’s does), so no one can tamper with it when you’re charging it in an open area. And finally, you shouldn’t be forced to use the TVS app for something as simple as resetting the trip meter on the TFT display.  TFT display shows you all the relevant information, but some functions are needlessly complicated. TVS iQube 2.2 ride and handling (9/10) Plush suspension setup and comfortable ergos are hallmarks of the iQube Happily, all those niggles fade away into the background once you (swiftly and silently) get on the move. The iQube is one of the few scooters whose riding experience has always been uncluttered and very similar to a petrol scooter – aside from the pin-drop silence owing to its hub-mounted motor. At 110kg and with a low 770mm perch, this 2.2 variant is one of the lightest electric scooters on sale and is wonderfully manageable for smaller riders. At the same time, the riding position is spacious enough so that taller riders won’t feel cramped, and in general, the iQube’s rider triangle is spot on. Among EVs, the iQube’s riding experience is the closest to that of a petrol scooter. The seat is also generously roomy and can accommodate two full-size adults without a hitch. However, heavier riders will find that the seat’s padding is a little too soft, and they will start sinking into the hard seat base underneath after an hour or so of continuous riding. The seat is spacious but the padding is a little soft, which means heavier riders will sink in after a while. Considering its overarching role as a family scooter, the iQube has respectable handling capabilities, and it feels light on its feet in city traffic without seeming flighty at higher speeds. Credit must also go to its plush suspension setup, which keeps you comfortable and will shield you from all but the nastiest bumps Mumbai’s roads throw at you every so often. Braking performance is not lacking either because the iQube 2.2 is one of the only electric scooters at this end of the market to come with a front disc brake. While it doesn’t have hill-hold control like most other EVs do, the brake-lock clasp comes in handy, especially if you park your vehicle on a slope.  Brake-lock clasp is a handy feature, especially since the iQube doesn’t get hill-hold. TVS iQube 2.2 performance and efficiency (9/10) The range claim is extremely accurate, and it is very usable even in Eco mode With a 75kph top speed, this 2.2 variant is slightly slower in outright terms than the others, but never once did it feel like it was unusably slow in the situations we subjected it to. And unlike some other e-scooters where the Eco mode is quite dull, on the iQube, you can easily climb flyovers with a pillion and overtake traffic. Eco limits you to 47kph, and to go faster than that, you need to switch to Power mode, where you get zippier acceleration and can hit the scooter’s top speed. One of the iQube’s hallmarks is its plush suspension setup, which keeps you comfy on our roads. You can easily switch from Eco to Power while you’re on the move by using the dedicated mode switch, but if you want to go back to Eco, you need to slow down to 45kph or less. While initial acceleration from its hub-mounted motor isn’t as energetic as an Ather Rizta’s, the iQube is still a pretty zippy thing, and on most occasions, you’ll overtake everyone else who’s standing at the same signal as you. The motor is very quiet; outright performance is more than enough but initial acceleration lacks urgency. The iQube’s range indicator is ultra-reliable, a factor that greatly aids peace of mind on an EV, and what you see on the screen is how far you’ll actually go. In fact, in our tests, the iQube 2.2 covered 76.4km in Eco when TVS itself claims that the range is 75km. And the fact that you have a reasonably fast 650W charger means that topping up a flat battery to full takes a mere 3 hours and 24 minutes. This combination of a pretty quick charger and a small battery has proven to be a masterstroke, giving this iQube variant one of the quickest charging times in the industry. There are no compromises here, as you see in other EVs at a similar price. TVS iQube 2.2 price and verdict (9/10) The iQube 2.2 is a very compelling option among the affordable EVs currently sold in India Aside from some small UI issues that need ironing out, this Rs 1 lakh iQube 2.2 carries forward all the strong points of the other variants without exception. While it is an affordable machine, crucially, it doesn’t feel cheap. And knowing how reliable our previous TVS iQube S long-termer was, this one, too, should run without any hiccups every time you twist the key – come rain or sunshine. The iQube is one of few EVs at this price to get a front disc brake. Stopping force is decent, and it has CBS. This brings us to the question we posed about the iQube 2.2 at the start: does it feel hamstrung like some similarly priced electric scooters? As we are sure you can tell by now, the answer is an emphatic no. If you are someone whose daily running is under 50km and have secure charging at your home, then choosing this iQube really is a great way to save a lot of money.

    "description": "The premium electric vehicles (EV) space has really begun to heat up. While there weren’t any options between the Rs 25 lakh MG ZS EV and the Rs 1 crore Mercedes EQC earlier, now there are as many as six EVs priced around Rs 50 lakh on sale. Of these, the Hyundai Ioniq 5, the recently launched BYD Sealion 7 and the locally made BMW iX1 LWB appear to be the most compelling. We brought the three together and put them through our real-world tests to see which one deserves a spot in your garage. All three EVs measure over 4.6 metres in length, over 1.8 metres in width and have a 2.8-metre or longer wheelbase. The BYD is the longest and the widest, the BMW is the tallest, and the Hyundai trumps the other two in wheelbase length. As for their underpinnings, the BYD and Hyundai have born-electric platforms, which allow for better packaging and interior space. As such, these two feature a properly usable frunk (front trunk), which the ICE-to-EV converted BMW lacks.

The Ioniq 5 takes the shape of a large hatchback; the iX1 is more like a traditional SUV, while the Sealion 7 looks like a coupé-SUV. It really depends on which style you prefer, but all of them stand out in their own way with distinctive design elements. The Ioniq 5 has a neo-retro look with sharp cuts and creases and unique multi-spoke, dual-tone alloys, and I particularly like the rectangular lighting elements. In contrast, the Sealion 7 has a more rounded design that goes with BYD’s family look. It does look large and ungainly from the front, but the large alloys and the tapering roofline add some flair. At the rear, there’s a connected lighting element, which has some nice details. The BMW is the most conventional by far and has that upright stance of an SUV. It features BMW’s signature kidney grille, which appears a bit too large, as do the LED headlights. Its side profile does not look the most proportionate, thanks to the longer wheelbase and the smaller 18-inch wheels; the rear is quite similar to the standard X1, with large, L-shaped LED tail-lamps. BYD Sealion 7 vs Hyundai Ioniq 5 vs BMW iX1 LWB interior space and comfort The Sealion 7’s interior is superbly finished and loaded with tech, but the instrument cluster is cluttered. All three EVs have distinct identities inside the cabin as well. Starting with the Sealion 7, you’re greeted with a relatively conventional-looking dashboard, which houses the screens for the touchscreen infotainment system and the driver’s display. The 15.6-inch touchscreen, in typical BYD fashion, can change orientation from landscape to portrait, is very slick to operate, has high-res graphics, and even gets an updated UI over its siblings. This screen controls most of the car’s functions, but it’s nice that there are some physical controls in the centre console and a neat trick to adjust the AC without going into the sub-menus. All you have to do is swipe on the screen with three fingers from left to right for fan speed and from top to bottom for the temperature. Tinted glass at the back helps keep the Sealion 7 cool. The driver’s display, too, is high-res, but it appears very cluttered, and a lot of the important info appears small. But you have to commend BYD for the superb material quality and fit-and-finish, which feel on par with European luxury brands. The BYD's high-res 360-degree camera is one of the best. In the centre console, you get two wireless charging pads and two cup holders; there’s even some storage space below the console. The front seats feature ventilation, have just the right amount of cushioning and are very comfortable for occupants of all sizes. At the back, too, the seats feel plush and can be reclined; there’s loads of space, particularly legroom. The large windows and the glass roof elevate the sense of space. BYD’s 500-litre boot can fit in a lot. BYD has also packed the Sealion 7 with features like wireless smartphone integration, a 12-speaker Dynaudio music system, powered front seats, auto headlamps and wipers, a gesture-controlled and powered tailgate, dynamic ambient lighting, and much more. As for safety, there are 11 airbags, including one between the front seats and two for the rear side bolsters. There’s also Level 2 ADAS, a crisp 360-degree camera, and a driver-attention monitor, which is way too sensitive – even briefly glancing at the touchscreen generates a warning. The Sealion 7’s rear seat is big on space and feels the plushest. As for the new iX1 LWB, it has the same dash design as the ICE-powered X1 and the iX1 xDrive30, with a large, curved display that includes the infotainment touchscreen and the instrument panel. There are large, horizontal AC vents on the passenger side of the dash and under the screen, below which a sizeable wireless charging pad is located. The centre console extends from the centre armrest and houses some of the car’s key functions. The screens, while high in resolution, are too complicated tonavigate initially and on the go. While the fit and finish are great, some materials lower in the cabin are hard and scratchy. The steering is typically BMW with a chunky rim; the touchscreen has swallowed too many controls, and the UI is confusing. The front seats are supportive, but larger passengers may find them narrow, and they don’t have ventilation, which the other two EVs provide. The cushioning is firmer than the BYD’s. While the seats may not seem as comfortable initially, you’ll feel the cushioning is well-judged the longer you spend time in them. It’s at the rear where you get to experience the benefits of a long wheelbase. Though you are seated quite low and in a bit of a knees-up position because of the underfloor battery, you get acres of legroom; the seat base is longer by 15mm, and the backrest can be reclined up to 28.5 degrees, all of which make it more comfortable than the standard wheelbase version of the iX1. Compared to the BYD, though, the BMW feels narrower inside, and the backrest cushioning is on the firmer side. What also would’ve added to the comfort is rear sun blinds, which are also missing in the BYD. The iX1 has the most legroom but doesn’t get sunshades. The BMW is the least feature-rich EV here, but it still gets stuff like a large panoramic glass roof, ambient lighting, auto LED headlamps, connected tech, a smartphone-enabled key, leather upholstery, eight airbags and Level 2 ADAS tech. BMW’s 490-litre boot is the smallest here. Now, let’s come to the Hyundai Ioniq 5. Step inside it, and you get a great sense of space, thanks to the massive glass area, light colours, flat floor and the absence of a traditional centre console. Hyundai has used recycled and sustainable materials inside, and what’s great is that the fit and finish, as well as the touch and feel of bits, are top-notch. However, the white upholstery stains very easily, as you’d typically expect. The Hyundai's cabin is well-finished, logically laid out and big on practicality; UI is the easiest to use. Headlining the dash are two 12.3-inch screens – one for the instrument cluster and the other for the infotainment. These displays are crisp and easy to read, and the UI is easier to understand and navigate than that of the other two. The steering is a 2-spoke unit that houses a round drive-mode selector, while the drive-selector stalk is beneath the headlamp stalk. Uniquely, the entire centre console slides front and back to tailor the space and access. There are also plenty of storage spaces, such as a huge drawer in place of the glove box, large door bins and the centre console itself. The Ioniq 5's front seats are cooled, heated and get ottomans. The front seats are broad and supremely comfortable, with soft cushioning and plenty of electric adjustments, including extendable leg rests, and they can be configured into a comfy lounger. They also have ventilation and heating. The rear seats, though not as comfy as the ones in front, are easily wide enough for three adults, with the outer two seats featuring heating and electric adjustment. However, you are seated in a knees-up position due to the battery under the floor. The Hyundai's rear seats are wide enough for three, but you’re seated in a knees-up position. The Ioniq 5 also packs in a panoramic fixed glass roof, an 8-speaker Bose sound system, a 360-degree parking camera, dual-zone climate control, an electric boot, ESP, six airbags and ADAS. Wired smartphone integration is a downer, though.

The Sealion 7 has an all-wheel drive (there is also an RWD version), the Ioniq 5 is rear-wheel drive and, rather unconventionally, it’s the BMW that’s front-wheel drive. The BYD, in this dual-motor Performance guise, also has a clear advantage in terms of output (530hp/690Nm), followed by the Hyundai (217hp/350Nm) and the BMW (204hp/250Nm). And this is reflected in the performance figures. The Sealion 7 Performance makes the 0-100kph sprint in a brisk 4.43 seconds, compared to the Ioniq’s 7.48 seconds and the iX1’s 11.30 seconds. It’s the same story in rolling acceleration, with the BYD comfortably outperforming its rivals. Before we get into the nitty-gritty of how these feel like to drive, one thing each of them does admirably well is delivering power in a linear manner, unlike EVs of old, which served up all of their performance in one big chunk right from the get-go. All three also get drive modes, which affect throttle sensitivity, power delivery and range. Let’s start with the BYD, which easily feels the quickest of the lot. What’s nice is that it is able to put its power down in a tidy manner, thanks to the AWD system. On the move, you’ll also appreciate how smooth and progressive the power delivery is. And while the powertrain is silent, you will start to hear more of the outside world as you get closer to triple-digit speeds despite it featuring double-glazed front windows. Similarly, in the Hyundai, you don’t get that neck-snapping acceleration; the power delivery is nice and smooth. But that’s not to say that you’ll feel a lack of performance, as the Ioniq 5 feels sprightly in the Sport mode. The throttle modulation has also been judged very well, and it feels like a normal ICE car to drive. What’s also nice is that suspension, road and tyre noises barely disrupt the silence of the cabin. The BMW, by far, feels the most relaxed out of the trio, and while it packs over 200hp, given the weight it has to haul around, it can leave you wanting more, like when you want to make a quick overtake. As it has a front-wheel drive, there’s also some torque steer to contend with when driven flat out. As for sound insulation, it isn’t as quiet on the move as the Ioniq but fares better than the Sealion 7.

The Sealion 7 has an 82.56kWh unit with BYD’s blade cell LFP battery technology. The Ioniq 5 has the second-largest battery pack at 72.6kWh, and the BMW has the smallest at 66.4kWh; these two use the NMC battery chemistry. However, the Ioniq 5 has the highest claimed range of 631km, followed by the Sealion 7 (542km) and the iX1 (531km). In our real-world range test, the Ioniq 5 came out on top with a calculated overall range of 457km, significantly higher than the other two. The iX1 LWB had a 398km range, and given the extra power, the BYD delivered the least range of 371km. And, as is the case with most EVs, all three were more efficient in the city cycle, where they can recuperate more energy.  The move to the long wheelbase has come at the cost of some agility. All three get multiple regen braking modes, but the BMW has an advantage here with four modes; the Hyundai gets three, while the BYD has only two. One must note that the BMW also has an adaptive regen mode, but it’s not very intuitive, and the Hyundai is the only one in which you can turn off regen, allowing for free coasting. However, the BMW’s mode controls are baked into the touchscreen, making it tedious to change them on the move, and it’s also the most aggressive of the lot. On the other hand, the BYD feels the least aggressive, even in its ‘High’ mode. It’s the Hyundai’s regen that is best tuned, with a natural feel in the lower level, and you can even adjust levels or turn it off via paddle shifters. Also, the iX1 and the Ioniq 5 are capable of one-pedal driving. Despite huge 20-inch alloys, the ride is supple. The Ioniq 5 is the clear winner when it comes to charging speeds, as it is capable of DC fast charging at speeds of up to 350kW, which is enough to take it from 10 to 80 percent in just 18 minutes. The BYD can be charged up to 150kW on a DC fast charger. Both these are also capable of V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) and V2L (vehicle-to-load) functions, wherein they can charge other EVs and power/charge other devices. The BMW can be fast-charged up to 130kW. BYD Sealion 7 vs Hyundai Ioniq 5 vs BMW iX1 LWB ride comfort and handling As for ride and handling, the Sealion 7 has a hint of firmness to its ride, but it manages to deal with road imperfections fairly well. The 20-inch wheels on this AWD version are a fly in the ointment, making it feel crashy over bumps. Given its mass and high centre of gravity, the BYD rolls a fair bit around bends, and its steering feels a little too quick. Smaller 18-inch wheels help give it a cushy ride. The Ioniq 5 feels planted at all speeds, and you’ll like the maturity with which it drives. The steering is direct and has a good heft, but it doesn’t feel sporty to drive, which is fine given its focus on comfort. And despite sitting on those large 20-inch alloys, the ride feels comfy and well-damped, and the Ioniq 5 deals with the rough stuff fairly well. There are some minor vertical movements over expansion joints, but it feels well-controlled. Meanwhile, the long wheelbase has affected the BMW iX1’s handling just as you’d expect. It doesn’t feel as agile as the regular wheelbase, dual-motor iX1 xDrive30, but it still grips corners admirably well with little body roll to speak of. The ride quality, like in most BMWs lately, is excellent. It feels very absorbent and does a good job of making the iX1 feel composed over most surfaces. BYD Sealion 7 vs Hyundai Ioniq 5 vs BMW iX1 LWB price and verdict The iX1, which has BMW’s badge value to bank on, has plenty of space at the back and is very attractively priced at Rs 49 lakh; dynamically, it’s the best here. But it has its shortcomings – it isn’t as equipped as the others; the infotainment system is unnecessarily complex and has swallowed a lot of key functions; the rear-seat backrest cushioning is firm, and certain plastics lower in the cabin feel out of place on a BMW. Now let’s sum up the Sealion 7. It is BYD’s most rounded offering in India yet and has everything we love about the Seal sedan in a more practical package. The interior quality and fit-and-finish are top-notch; it’s got all the tech and features you need, a comfortable backseat, and the most powerful drivetrain that’s quite smooth. It’s also the only one here with all-wheel drive (Rs 54.90 lakh), though there’s an RWD version with a higher claimed range of 567km but a lower output (310hp, 380Nm) and a price tag of Rs 48.90 lakh, which is still more expensive than the Hyundai and with a lower promised range. The Sealion 7 loses ground in its real-world range, which is the lowest, and it isn’t as well-rounded in many specific matters – the sound levels inside the cabin are high, the ride isn’t as plush, and the driver’s display is cluttered. And then, there’s BYD’s relative lack of an aftersales network. And this brings us to the winner, the Hyundai Ioniq 5. It standsout as the most approachable and well-rounded package. The cabin is spacious, the seats are very comfy and unique, and the infotainment is easy to navigate. The Ioniq 5 is also the most natural to drive, has the best real-world range and can charge at the fastest pace. To top it off, it’s the most affordable, too, at Rs 46 lakh. It’s no wonder then that the Ioniq 5 won our Car of the Year 2024 award and this comparison, too.
