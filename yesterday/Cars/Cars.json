    "description": "We recently took the Tuono 457 to the CoASTT High Performance Centre for our annual track day, and even though I missed out on testing it on the street, hopping on it at the track was worth the wait. It was so impressive, in fact, that it deserved a standalone story of its own. Aprilia Tuono 457 design (8/10) A good looking design but the traditional Tuono face is missed. The Tuono is essentially an RS 457 in streetwear – same engine, chassis, suspension, brakes and tyres. The tank is slightly reshaped, and of course, those upright handlebars change the ergonomics. But the big surprise was that the lap time in Rajini Krishnan’s hands was nearly identical to the RS 457’s at our 2024 Track Day. No clip-ons, no wind protection, and less front-end load, yet it hung right in there. That’s remarkable. The fuel tank shape is slightly reprofiled on the Tuono. A few things played to the Tuono’s advantage this year. The track surface at the CoASTT was in better shape than the last time we visited, the weather was a little kinder, and, as always, familiarity counts. This bike also ran the optional quickshifter, something Rajini appreciated. It’ll set you back Rs 20,000 – not cheap by any stretch, especially on a sub-Rs 4 lakh machine – but it works well and really adds to the experience. Aprilia Tuono 457 ergonomics (6/10) Acessible seat height but cramped for tall riders. Like with the RS 457, the real gem remains the engine, and Aprilia’s 457cc parallel-twin continues to be the segment’s crown jewel. 48 horsepower and segment-leading torque only tell half the story. The motor is also very smooth, and it packs crisp throttle response and a rich and evocative sound. With that wide, sculpted tank between your legs and the bike’s superbike-like soundtrack, there’s a genuine sense of occasion every time you roll on the gas. That said, it’s not all roses. Ergonomics is where the Tuono 457 will leave taller riders wanting – especially on track. I found myself cramped against the rear seat bump stop, with the bike’s bodywork feeling particularly slippery. The already compact RS 457 felt more accommodating with its wide, more forward set clip-ons, but the Tuono’s setup makes the cockpit feel more restrictive. Some of this can easily be fixed by adding some grip tape and maybe by modifying the rear seat to allow the rider more room to slide back. But if you’re close to 6 feet tall, you will find this bike cramped – particularly in how the fuel tank recesses lock your knees in place – and that won’t be just at the race track. Aprilia Tuono 457 performance (9/10) Superb mid-range makes up for flat top-end and it makes a great sound. Beyond the hard metrics, the Tuono 457 is engaging, playful and, crucially, fast enough to make every session exciting. The aluminium chassis, firm suspension and impressive Eurogrip Pro Torque Xtreme tyres all come together to make this (along with the RS 457) probably the most impressive handling bike ever to be made in India.  Quickshifter is an impressive but expensive option CoASTT is a flowing circuit with few heavy braking zones, and while the 457’s front brake fade is a known issue, it wasn’t a problem here. That said, if you plan on hitting more tracks with more demanding braking zones, upgrading the pads, fluid, or master cylinder is something you’ll have to look into. Aprilia Tuono 457 handling (9/10) Chassis, suspension and tyres work well but brake fade needs to be addressed. What makes the Tuono so special is that it isn’t a detuned RS that trades capability for comfort. It carries the same spirit, the same capability, and nearly the same lap times. Unfortunately, it’s not all perfect. First, there’s the bike’s size and the fact that the design isn’t as evocative as the RS 457, which is more visually linked to its bigger siblings.  More worryingly, however, there have also recently been some customer reports of unexpected engine reliability issues, and this is something that Aprilia needs to address in a speedy and decisive manner. From a sheer capability standpoint, though, the Tuono 457 has exceeded expectations, and that’s not something that happens very often. Aprilia Tuono 457 verdict (9/10) Nearly as capable as the RS 457 and with considerably more seat comfort.  What really struck me is how this bike stacks up against the competition. Whether it’s KTM’s singles or Yamaha’s twin-cylinder offerings, the Tuono feels like it’s operating on a higher plane – especially on a fast circuit like CoASTT that rewards power and flow. In fact, the lap time is closer to more powerful bikes like the Suzuki GSX-8R and Ducati Hypermotard Mono than it is to rivals like the KTM 390 Duke and Yamaha R3.

    "description": "Vietnamese EV brand Vinfast is making sure it takes no half measures with its India entry that’s right around the corner. While the larger VF7 will be the first model to be launched, this VF6 is arguably more significant. It will operate in what is the hotbed of the Indian EV space right now, the midsize crossover segment, currently populated by the likes of the Creta Electric, Curvv EV, BE 6 and Windsor. With competition like that, Vinfast knows it has to work doubly hard to make an impact, and to that end, it has loaded the VF6 up with features and a healthy specifications sheet. And with local assembly right from the get-go, there’s the promise of an aggressive price as well. Will that be enough to let this interesting Vietnamese EV make its way onto your shortlist? 2025 Vinfast VF6 exterior design and engineering – 8/10 Well-proportioned, with a muscular and distinctly crossover shape. The ‘V Face’ LED DRL signature running the width of the nose will make this instantly recognisable as a Vinfast and does well to establish the new brand’s identity. The bumper houses the headlamps as well as a low-set honeycomb grille, which also includes the radar module for the ADAS system. V-Face LED DRLs will make it instantly recognisable as a Vinfast.   The VF6 is 4.3 metres long, 1.8 metres wide and 1.6 metres tall, with a generous 2.7-metre wheelbase, which is bang in the centre of midsize SUV territory. The VF6 has been raised for India, giving it 190mm of ground clearance, and Vinfast has opted to go with 18-inch wheels and taller tyres rather than the 19s you get in other markets. Both these changes help add some road presence to a vehicle that has a distinctly rounded crossover shape, something that hasn’t always worked in India. Plastic cladding surrounds the wheel arches, and the brushed silver window lining leads to a unique C-pillar styling feature. The body panels are muscular and well-sculpted, with shoulder lines that lead to a high-set rear LED element, with split tail-lamps placed lower down. Gets a raised ride height for India, giving it a ground clearance of 190mm. Under the small rear window sits a 423-litre boot with a relatively narrow loading area. Under its floor is a tray to hold charging cables, tools, and more (there is no frunk), but if removed, Vinfast could potentially fit a space-saver spare tyre. 2025 Vinfast VF6 interior space and comfort – 6/10 Space is just adequate for the car’s size; design is uncluttered. Vinfast has gone for a clean, uncluttered interior design for the VF6, and central to that is the absence of any instrument cluster or driver’s display. What you get instead is a low-set dashboard giving you a clear view out the front, apart from a tall, freestanding 12.9-inch touchscreen that sits proud of the dashboard at the centre. More on this later. Interior has clean, uncluttered look, thanks to absence of instrument cluster. The front seats are comfy (and ventilated), with power adjustment for the driver’s side. The gap between the dashboard and the console between the seats gives a sense of space in an otherwise dull all-grey cabin, and while build quality seems robust, a few basic-feeling plastics are on display. Also improving the sense of space is the large fixed glass roof that truly feels edge to edge, extending behind the rear passengers’ heads. Though not present here, Vinfast says some form of heat insulation will be introduced by the time the car goes on sale in India. Rear-seat comfort is good, but space isn’t as much as rivals. Rear-seat space is decent, though not quite as much as you get from others in the segment. Comfort, however, is good, with generous cushioning, a flat floor and a seating position that isn’t overtly ‘knees up’. 2025 Vinfast VF6 features and safety – 9/10 Loaded to the teeth, but there’s an over-reliance on the touchscreen. As mentioned before, the Vinfast VF6 is loaded with features, but the execution of some of them leaves a little to be desired. Driver essentials like speed, range, drive state, state of charge and safety warnings are displayed in the top right corner of the touchscreen, but for India, Vinfast has been sure to include a heads-up display as part of the standard equipment. This takes some getting used to when you’re on the move. Basic functions, including headlights and mirrors, are operated through the screen. The steering wheel is compact with a few essential control buttons on it, and the AC vents are inlaid horizontally in the floating dash. The only buttons you’ll find on the console are for drive selection, which call for a firm prod to activate, as well as a shortcut key that was configured to toggle drive modes. All other functions are in the touchscreen, including climate control, regen modes, headlights and even mirror adjustment. It’s not user-friendly, especially as the icons for these are far too small. Still, the list is long, and highlights include dual-zone climate control, ventilated front seats, a heads-up display, a panoramic glass roof, vegan leather upholstery, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and connected car tech. Buttons for drive selection require a firm prod to activate.  Vinfast says it’s going after a 5-star Bharat NCAP rating and, to that end, has spared no expense on the safety kit. The VF6 gets 7 airbags as standard, an electronic parking brake, a 360-degree camera array, park assist, automatic headlamps and wipers, as well as ADAS with Level 2 autonomy. 2025 Vinfast VF6 range and efficiency – 8/10 WLTP figure doesn’t sound generous, but range for India could improve While a smaller battery is offered overseas, the Vinfast VF6 in India is offered in its Plus guise, which means a 59.6kWh battery, which is good by segment standards. Vinfast has said that due to tweaks made to the powertrain for India, we’ll have to wait for the MIDC or ARAI official figure to get a more accurate idea of what Indian buyers can expect. But, for reference, the Vinfast VF6 range on the WLTP cycle for this model sold overseas is 480km on a full charge. European-spec VF6 has a WLTP-certified range of 480km. As for charging, Vinfast hasn’t specified times or speeds, but the car will come with a CCS2 DC charging port. AC fast charging can be done at speeds up to 7.2kW. 2025 Vinfast VF6 performance and refinement – 8/10 Strong performance with drive modes that make a difference. This being the VF6 Plus variant, it gets the more powerful 204hp motor, and that puts it on the higher end of the segment. All that power and 310Nm of torque are sent to just the front wheels, and under hard acceleration in Sport mode, this can result in some torque steer and a bit of shudder through the steering wheel. Vinfast VF6 powertrain specsMotor power204hpMotor torque310NmBattery capacity59.6kWhDrive layoutFWD0-100kph8.89sAC chargingUp to 7.2kW  Still, acceleration feels strong, and Vinfast claims a 0-100kph time of 8.89 seconds, which is pretty brisk. Apart from the initial hesitation, power delivery feels strong and easy to deploy. However, our time with the car was brief and the conditions limited to a small stretch of Vinfast’s test track, so we’ll have to wait until we drive it in India for a full performance review. In Eco and Normal modes, it feels far more relaxed in its power delivery, making it easy to use in everyday driving. While regen modes are present – Off, Low, Medium and High – they didn’t feel particularly strong or obtrusive. Refinement appeared to be good in the controlled environment we were in, with only the synthesised acceleration sound being heard in the cabin. Performance in Sport mode is quite brisk.   2025 Vinfast VF6 ride comfort and handling – 8/10 Has an almost European heft to its dynamic setup. Again, with the time and conditions of this early preview being very limited, a proper dynamic evaluation will have to wait, but early impressions are promising. There’s a reassuring heft to the steering that doesn’t come at the cost of easy manoeuvrability. What’s more, the drive modes have an even greater effect on the steering weight than on the acceleration. It feels a little artificial, but the steps up in weight are clearly perceptible. The VF6 holds its line confidently at high speeds remarkably, at a level that you don’t expect in this segment. The level of stability and control from the suspension feels firm and heavy, like that of a European car, which is only a good thing. 2025 Vinfast VF6 price and verdict – 7/10 Promises to be competitively priced even with its long features list. The recipe for the VF6 for India is a potent and compelling one indeed; Vinfast has made sure of it. And with local assembly right from day one, the price should be competitive, too; we expect it to be in the region of Rs 22 lakh (ex-showroom) for the single, fully loaded VF6 Plus variant. In fact, the brand promises it will be more than that; it will be aggressive, and that’s sort of a USP for Vinfast, a brand that’s known for entering new markets and establishing itself quickly and competitively. First impressions from the limited preview have us excited and optimistic. Apart from the car itself, Vinfast will be bringing the full might of its parent conglomerate Vingroup to India, starting with a service network and a charging network, with the possibility of an app-based taxi service, hotels, hospitals, housing and even schools further down the line. They’re taking India seriously, and they want you to know it. But back to the car; is it as competitive as it needs to be? In our limited preview, some flaws stood out, notably its unintuitive interior control scheme and rear-seat space that isn’t quite up to segment standards. But there’s no doubt a robust level of engineering has gone into the car. Moreover, it’s heartening to see how many India-specific changes the brand has made, many of which will filter into international markets further down the line. More when we get to drive the car in India, but for now, consider us excited and optimistic.

    "description": "Update to seven-seat SUV follows similar changes made by JLR to the Defender and Discovery ranges Land Rover has updated the Discovery Sport again, following changes to the larger Discovery and the Defender. The middle-rung Dynamic SE and range-topping Dynamic HSE trims have been replaced by new grades named Landmark and Metropolitan, while the entry-level S has become the Dynamic S. There are also new option packages aimed at visits to the beach, road trips and snowy weather. The Landmark is distinguished by a mountain-range logo on its treadplates and projected by its puddle lights. It brings kit including a sliding and reclining second row of seats, a panoramic glass roof and a 3D camera for manoeuvres in tight spaces. The Metropolitan, identifiable by its silver front grille, builds on the Landmark's specification with the addition of 14-way adjustable heated and cooled seats, a 14-speaker Meridian sound system and 20in alloy wheels. The Dynamic S meanwhile receives visual tweaks including a gloss-black finish for the wheel arches, lower body siding and front grille. The powertrain line-up remains the same as before: mild-hybrid four-cylinder diesel engines with outputs of 160bhp and 201bhp; and a petrol-engined plug-in hybrid with 265bhp and 36 miles of electric-only range. Prices start at £45,440 for the Dynamic S with the lesser diesel engine and reach £59,545 for the Metropolitan PHEV.",

    "description": "Polestar gets into proper luxury SUV territory while trying to stay sporty There’s an interesting circularity to the way premium car makers are now revisiting and reinventing their electric luxury SUVs. It’s six or seven years – or about a full model cycle – since the Jaguar I-Pace, Audi E-tron and Mercedes EQC first gave buyers premium-branded electric options for their next family-sized SUV. The fresh meat those same buyers are being offered today – the Porsche Macan Electric, the Audi Q6 E-tron, the refreshed BMW iX and the subject of this test – represent the way EV technology has matured over that period as much by their variety as by their generational leaps on performance, efficiency, range and charging speed.The all-new Polestar 3 illustrates how very adeptly. Based on a model platform shared with the much larger and taller Volvo EX90, it shows that common underpinnings can spawn very different products. This five-seater luxury SUV also occupies a notional Rubicon for Polestar because it’s the largest passenger car its maker will offer for the foreseeable future.If the firm can successfully demonstrate the sort of progressive driver appeal here that it claims as a defining characteristic of its brand, then, we can probably believe it when it says its cars will never be dull to drive.",

By the end of this decade, Tata Motors is aiming to have as many as 15 different nameplates in its portfolio, up from the current eight. This comes just as Hyundai announced its own product onslaught for India, comprising 26 models by 2030, with both carmakers (along with Mahindra) vying for the position of the number two carmaker in the country. Tata Motors’ new nameplates will be spread across ICE and EV divisions Tata to invest up to Rs 35,000 crore between FY2026 and FY2030 in PV business Tata announces new investment for PV business Company is facing tough competition from Hyundai, Mahindra  Tata Motors has announced that it will invest Rs 33,000-35,000 crore between the financial year 2026 and 2030 in the passenger vehicle business, including its EV business. The company noted that the investment will be focused on expanding the product portfolio with software-defined vehicles (SDVs) and next-generation powertrains. After four years of strong performance, Tata Motors saw a dip in volume and market share in FY2025, thanks to growing competition from homegrown rival Mahindra. Even in the EV segment, Tata’s early lead of 80-85 percent market share from just two years ago has now fallen to about 55 percent. New product launches from Mahindra, and especially MG, have significantly eaten into Tata’s early-mover advantage. Sierra will be the first new nameplate from the upcoming product onslaught.  Speaking to our sister publication, Autocar Professional, Shailesh Chandra, the MD of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles, said, “In the short term, I expect some impact [in the EV market], but I’m not overly perturbed by it. My focus is on whether we’re preparing ourselves well for the long term. A lot of foundational work is underway to mainstream EVs. We’re focusing on micro-segments across different markets to sustain growth beyond the next 18–24 months.” What are these upcoming seven all-new nameplates? 23 updates, 7 all-new models  Out of the 30 new product interventions planned until 2030, 23 of them will be refreshes to existing models – including the next generation of the Nexon, a facelift for ICE-powered Punch, and a new petrol engine for the Harrier and Safari, among others. What’s more interesting are the seven all-new nameplates that are in the pipeline. We know one of these will be the all-new Sierra that’ll debut in both ICE and EV iterations later this year. These will be followed by the Avinya range of EVs – previewed by the Avinya and Avinya X concepts – from 2027 onwards. We are also going to see the production version of the Avinya X before 2030.  And while there’s not much info about the remaining four – two new EVs and two new ICE models – sources say that these will be bookended at both ends of the market. So, there could be a new SUV positioned below the Nexon and parallel to the Punch. At the higher end, there could be another SUV positioned alongside the Harrier, perhaps with a coupe-ish profile. One thing is certain: all upcoming products will be SUVs in some form or shape. Tata’s existing product portfolio doesn’t have obvious gaps, and most of them already have an EV equivalent. So, there will undoubtedly be some overlap with existing products, much like Maruti has in the entry-level segments. Tata Motors aims for 20 percent market share by 2030 EVs could comprise 30 percent sales by 2030 Tata Motors is targeting a 16 percent market share (including EVs) by FY2027 and further expanding to 18-20 percent within the subsequent two to three years. In its EV business, the company anticipates maintaining its leadership position, with electric vehicles projected to constitute 20 percent of its total passenger vehicle volumes by the end of FY2027, rising further to 30 percent by FY2030. Tata’s rivals, however, aren’t staying still. Apart from Hyundai, Mahindra said last year that it is planning to launch 9 ICE-powered SUVs and 7 EVs by the end of this decade. Meanwhile, Maruti Suzuki is planning to expand its portfolio from 18 models to 27 models and plans an EV portfolio for four models by 2030. The competition among the top four carmakers is only going to get a lot fiercer.

    "description": "Shortly after the launch of the Toyota Fortuner mild-hybrid variants, the Japanese brand has trimmed the SUV’s line-up, listed separate prices for a new Platinum White Pearl exterior finish, and increased prices by up to Rs 68,000.

As the above table shows, price for the sole Fortuner petrol variant has increased by Rs 68,000, while all diesel variants have seen a Rs 40,000 hike. Toyota Fortuner mild-hybrid price and features Gets 360-degree camera and terrain modes but misses out on ventilated seats The mild-hybrid Fortuner variants cost Rs 2 lakh more than the diesel 4x4 AT variants they effectively replace. Along with the 48V tech that enables the fuel-saving engine start-stop function, these mild-hybrid variants are also equipped with a 360-degree camera, a wireless smartphone charger and terrain modes – Mud, Sand, Rock, Dirt and Snow. However, they lack ventilated front seats, which are available on the standard Fortuner.

    "description": "In 2013, Scott Jones of NOISE Cycles showed up at Born Free 5 with a machine that captivated minds: a 1952 Harley-Davidson Panhead morphed into a race-inspired, aluminum-bodied bike with an asymmetrical face. He clutched the “Best in Show” award, netting him a brand new 120R motor from Harley-Davidson that came with the commitment of building a bike around it for the next year’s show. “My mind started spinning immediately,” says Scott. Within days, there was a sketch. The idea was a naked superbike – a bike with a silhouette that looked like the race machines that Eddie Lawson and Wes Cooley piloted to AMA victories. Before work started, however, Jones found himself in the Harley-Davidson Museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After a full day’s time inside the museum that blew his mind, there was a new idea: “The silhouette was going to mimic the WR Racers of the 1940s.”…",

But despite the rollercoaster that the embattled Austrian marque has been on, it hasn’t skipped a beat with new product releases. KTM’s newest release is good news for privateer rally racers; the 2026 KTM 450 Rally Replica is here, and it’s as desirable as ever.
