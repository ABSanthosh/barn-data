    "description": "This 1972 Ferrari 365 GTB/4 began its life as a Berlinetta and is said to have been delivered new to Lebanon before undergoing a conversion into Spyder configuration in Europe. Chassis 16295 was imported to Canada circa the 1980s and is said to have subsequently remained in Quebec for over 25 years before making its way to the US. Finished in red over black leather, the car is powered by a 4.4-liter Colombo V12 that breathes through six Weber carburetors and is paired with a five-speed manual transaxle. Additional features include servo-assisted ventilated disc brakes, four-wheel independent suspension, 15” Borrani wire wheels, a Stebro exhaust system, a black convertible top, air conditioning, power windows, and a Blaupunkt cassette radio. This Daytona Spyder convertible was purchased by the selling dealer in 2025 and is now offered in Costa Mesa, California, with a tool kit, two spare ignition units, and a clean Arizona title that lists the car as a 1973 model.",

    "description": "This 1954 Arnolt-Bristol Bolide is the first of 142 examples built and was sent to Bertone in Turin, Italy, in late 1953 for the construction of its Franco Scaglione-styled bodywork before returning to England for completion. Chassis 3000 arrived in New York in February 1954 and was delivered the following month to Ohio-based Columbus Sports Cars, whose proprietor subsequently raced the car at several Midwest tracks. Later in the decade, it was purchased in Cincinnati by an Indiana owner who made several modifications while campaigning it in various races, including relocation of the headlights, a color change, and the replacement of its Bristol engine with a Chevrolet V8. After receiving another color change under subsequent ownership in the mid-1960s, the car passed through several owners and fell into disuse. It was purchased out of a Joliet, Illinois, shed in a disassembled state in 1992 by an owner who embarked on a multi-year refurbishment that was completed in 2013. Work during the project included a repaint in the original shade of red after repairs to the body, a re-trim of the interior in tan leather, and the overhaul and installation of a replacement 1,971cc Bristol OHV inline-six. The car then changed hands in the mid-2010s and spent seven years with its previous owner before being purchased by the selling dealer in February 2025. Additional features include triple Solex carburetors, a replacement four-speed manual transmission with a remote shift assembly, hydraulic drum brakes, Koni shock absorbers, silver-painted 16” wheels, and a beige convertible top. This Arnolt-Bristol Bolide was listed on BaT in April 2025 and is now offered with documentation from the refurbishment and a clean Florida title.",

    "description": "Copenhagen is consistently ranked among the world’s most liveable cities, thanks to its pristine environment, unpolluted air and passion for sustainable urban living. It’s fitting, then, that Mercedes-Benz chose the clean Danish capital as the venue for the media drive of its latest electric car – the all-new CLA Electric. More than just another EV, it’s a showcase of the brand’s cutting-edge technology, wrapped in compact luxury. And for Indian buyers seeking to go green without giving up on prestige or performance, the CLA arrives at the end of this year as a truly compelling proposition. Mercedes-Benz CLA: exterior design and engineering Mercedes-Benz CLA dimensionsLength4,723mmWidth (w/o mirrors)1,855mmHeight 1,468mmWheelbase 2,790mmBoot volume 405-litres Frunk Volume 101-litres Kerb weight 2,055-2,135kg At its core lies the new Modular Architecture (MMA) – an EV-first platform ingeniously engineered to accommodate combustion engines and hybrid powertrains as well. It’s a quiet admission from Mercedes, once bullish about going all-electric by 2030, that customer sentiment has taken a different route. The road to electrification is a long one, especially in markets like India, where EV penetration is still under 5 percent. The CLA is underpinned by Mercedes' EV-first MMA architecture. The genius of the CLA Electric’s powertrain lies in its relentless pursuit of efficiency. Unlike most single-speed EVs, the in-house-developed, rear-mounted motor is paired with a two-speed gearbox. While this may seem counterintuitive for an EV, its goal is clear: to maximise efficiency across a broad speed range. While Porsche’s Taycan uses a two-speed for brutal acceleration, the CLA uses it to squeeze out every last kilometre. By optimising the motor's operating point, the extra ratio delivers a more sustained power band and improved efficiency – key to achieving its standout range. This allows Mercedes to fit a smaller, lighter battery, which in turn means faster charging, lower costs and fewer precious materials used. Sleek design gives it a drag coefficient of just 0.21. Completing the efficiency puzzle are the car’s exceptional aerodynamics. Electric Mercs have always been slick, but the CLA pushes the envelope with a drag coefficient of just 0.21. That’s thanks to features like flush door handles, and aero covers on the wheels and even the suspension arms. Every curve is sculpted to cut drag, helping the CLA deliver range figures rivalling larger and far more expensive EVs like the EQS or long-range BMW iX. The CLA has always been a design-first sedan, and the new electric version retains its distinctive four-door coupe silhouette. A 61mm stretch in the wheelbase improves interior space, while the low-slung, wide and athletic stance remains intact. Sealed-off grille is studded with 142 illuminated Mercedes stars. The shark-nose front panel – replacing the ICE CLA’s grille – is studded with 142 illuminated Mercedes stars and animated with playful welcome and goodbye sequences. Star-shaped Daytime Running Lamps and connected tail-lights complete a distinctive, high-tech look. One concern for India: the Euro-spec ground clearance is just 107mm. Great for autobahns, not for our speed breakers; a higher-riding Indian version is expected, and necessary. Mercedes-Benz CLA: interior space and comfort The longer wheelbase helps, but the CLA Electric’s rear seat still isn’t ideal for the chauffeur-driven. The backrest angle is a bit too upright, under-thigh support is limited, and the low roofline compromises headroom for taller passengers. The knees-up posture, due to the underfloor battery, also affects comfort. Mercedes engineers say the ICE versions will offer better posture with a lower floor. Rear seat comfort is compromised due to a knees-up seating position and upright backrest. You do get a flip-down armrest with cupholders and a slot for your phone (though no wireless charging). A key talking point is the fixed panoramic glass roof. It opens up the cabin and looks stunning, but in India’s harsh summers, the lack of a physical shade raises concerns. Mercedes claims the glass is heat-insulated with a special coating, but only a real-world Indian summer will validate that. Boot space is slightly down on the previous CLA, but the 405 litres on offer is still usable, with a flat floor and good shape – enough for a long weekend’s luggage. For India, though, the lack of a spare wheel is a red flag. A puncture repair kit is standard, but many buyers will opt for a space-saver spare, which will eat into the boot’s capacity. Unlike the EQS EVs, the bonnet opens. Gets a handy 101-litre frunk space. On the plus side, the CLA gets a 101-litre frunk – unlike the sealed bonnets on larger EQS models. It’s perfect for storing charging cables, a small bag, or essentials, freeing up the main boot for bulkier items or that spare tyre. Mercedes-Benz CLA: features and safety   Step inside and the CLA Electric feels like a digital sanctuary, debuting Mercedes’ fourth-generation MBUX infotainment system, built on the new MB.OS software. The CLA 250+ we drove features a 10.25-inch driver display and a large 14-inch central touchscreen. A 14-inch passenger screen is offered on the higher 350+ AWD variant (not coming to India), but we hope Mercedes India specifies the 250+ with the third screen as tech-laden cabins resonate strongly with Indian buyers. New CLA's interior feels like a digital sanctuary. The graphics are razor-sharp, the interface clean and intuitive, and the overall experience is a clear generation leap. Ambient lighting offers 64 colours and 10 brightness levels, while the optional Burmester 3D audio system with Dolby Atmos transforms every drive into a sensory event. AI takes centre stage too – the “Hey Mercedes” voice assistant now draws on ChatGPT and Google Gemini, making it surprisingly conversational and capable of handling nuanced queries. The new MBUX system also significantly enhances navigation. By using Google as its base and layering Mercedes’ own interface, the result is one of the best nav systems we’ve seen – blending the accuracy and functionality of Google Maps with the elegance of MBUX, along with live traffic and smart routing. The 10.1-inch digital cluster also gets a refreshed layout, although with fewer customisation options, in line with customer preferences for classic dials and simplified navigation views. New MBUX system significantly enhances navigation; uses Google as its base. Practicality hasn’t been forgotten. A floating centre console frees up useful storage space, with cupholders and USB-C ports. The previously fiddly steering controls are now tactile and precise, while the electric seat adjust controls respond once again with a satisfying click – small details that matter. Mercedes-Benz CLA: performance and refinement Mercedes-Benz CLA powertrain and specsBattery capacity 85kWh Battery TypeLithium-ionDrive layout RWD/AWDPower 272hp/354hp Torque 335Nm/515NmTransmission 2-speed 0-100kph (claimed)6.7sec/4.9secTop-speed (claimed)210kph Our drive through the scenic Danish countryside highlighted the CLA Electric’s dynamic strength. We tested the CLA 250+ – the rear-wheel-drive version headed to India – with 272hp on tap. The first impression is one of extraordinary refinement. Being electric, there’s no engine noise, but even road and wind noise are impressively muted. Only on coarse surfaces does tyre noise filter in – a testament to the excellent insulation. Refinement is astonishing; even road and wind noise are impressively muted.   Performance, while not overtly aggressive, is delivered with quintessential Mercedes smoothness and progression. The CLA builds power strongly and linearly, ensuring you never feel a shortage of punch. In Sport mode, the acceleration is more assertive, and the synthesised sound, piped through the speakers to mimic an engine note, sounds surprisingly good and adds to the driving engagement without being intrusive. Overtaking on the single-lane Danish roads felt effortless, and the CLA can dart through city traffic with ease, making it equally adept at urban commutes and spirited drives. The 0-100kph sprint in 6.7 seconds and a top speed limited to 210kph are perfectly adequate for real-world driving conditions. Performance is smooth and progressive; overtakes come effortlessly. A new brake-by-wire system has largely banished the artificial and inconsistent pedal feel of previous electrified Mercs. The CLA’s brakes now inspire confidence and feel perfectly normal, offering a consistent and reassuring response. The regen controls are at the gear selector stalk. The push-pull action toggles between freewheeling, medium, one-pedal and adaptive modes. It works fine, but the paddle-based setup was more engaging – mimicking gear shifts and adding involvement as you clicked through the regen levels like gears. Mercedes-Benz CLA: range and efficiency Mercedes-Benz CLA range and chargingVariant 250+ RWD/350 4Matic Range (WLTP-certified)Up to 792km/Up to 771km10-100% charging (11kW AC)9 hours DC Charging capacity Up to 320kW 10-80% DC fast charging 22 minutes The star of the MMA platform is its 800V electrical system, now the gold standard in premium EVs. Beyond numbers, it unlocks real-world advantages: ultra-fast charging that can inject 325km of range into its dense 85kWh NMC battery in just 10 minutes. That said, achieving such speeds requires a 320kW charger, which remains rare in India. Most customers will rely on AC home charging and, on highways, will have to depend on a charging network that largely comprises of slower 30-60kW chargers. The CLA has a WLTP-certified range of up to 792km. Still, it’s not charging speed but range that truly matters in the Indian context. On the WLTP cycle, the electric CLA delivers an astonishing range of up to 792km. Even more impressive was the real-world efficiency of 7.52km/kWh we achieved on our test drive – including several foot-to-the-floor bursts – translating to 734km of actual range and virtually eliminating range anxiety. Mercedes-Benz CLA: ride comfort and handling Out on winding roads, the CLA feels a joy to drive. The rear-wheel-drive setup keeps the steering uncorrupted, and modern Mercs have nailed steering feel. The CLA’s is precise, fluid and perfectly weighted, with well-contained body roll lending it composed agility through quick corners. Out on smooth Danish roads, ride comfort and handling were impressive. Ride comfort is vastly improved over the older CLA, which was hard-edged and brittle. While still on the firm side, the new car has a rounded, mature damping that smoothens out bumps well. The Danish roads may be misleadingly smooth, but this improved ride bodes well for Indian conditions too. Mercedes-Benz CLA: expected price and verdict Initially, the CLA Electric will be imported from Mercedes’ Rastatt plant in Germany, where costs are kept in check thanks to the platform’s dual-powertrain flexibility. CLA Electric stands out with its cutting-edge tech and remarkable efficiency. Mercedes-Benz plans to launch the CLA 250+ in India later this year, likely priced around Rs 60 lakh. For those who prefer to be chauffeur-driven, the back seat might be a weak spot. But for the self-driven, the CLA Electric stands out – stunning design with profound refinement, remarkable efficiency and cutting-edge tech. This isn’t just another EV. It’s a symbol of where electric luxury is headed. And for Indian buyers, it’s an invitation to be a part of that future.

    "description": "Mercedes-Benz has confirmed that the AMG CLE 53 4Matic+ Coupe will launch in India on August 12, confirming our prior report. The CLE line-up for the Indian market currently comprises the CLE 300 Cabriolet and will soon be bolstered by the hotter AMG CLE 53 in coupe form. Mercedes-AMG CLE 53 Coupe price in India likely to be around Rs 2 crore It gets a much sportier design with wide fenders; interior gets AMG-specific touches, too Powered by 3.0-litre twin-turbo straight-6 mild-hybrid mill developing 449hp and 560Nm Mercedes AMG CLE 53 Coupe exterior design Looks a lot more menacing than the CLE Cabriolet Much like other AMG models, the CLE 53 sports a Panamericana grille with vertical slats, flanked by swoopy LED headlights. The front bumper, expectedly, looks much more aggressive than that of the mild-mannered CLE Cabriolet, with a larger air dam. Over to the side, the AMG CLE 53 Coupe’s flared fenders stand as a design highlight, and there are air exits behind the front wheel arches. Wide fenders lend distinctive look to the rear We expect the AMG CLE 53 Coupe to come with 19-inch alloy wheels as standard, with 20-inchers offered as an optional fitment. The rear end looks quite striking thanks to the added width from the flared fenders, and it also features a unified but not connected tail-lamp cluster, a quad-exhaust setup, a gloss-black diffuser and air exits on either side. Mercedes AMG CLE 53 Coupe interior and features Sportier steering wheel, Alcantara trim, and lots of red stitching The overall interior layout of the AMG CLE 53 Coupe is shared with the CLE Cabriolet, including the 11.9-inch portrait-oriented infotainment touchscreen, a 12.3-inch digital driver’s display, a trio of central AC vents, and more. However, the AMG CLE 53 Coupe gets an AMG-spec 3-spoke steering wheel draped in Alcantara and leather with red stitching, as well as two extra touch controls. Alcantara, carbon-fibre and red stitching have been used throughout the cabin, too, and the dashboard and seats sport an all-black colour scheme, unlike the tan upholstery in the CLE Cabriolet. In terms of creature comforts, the AMG CLE 53 Coupe offers wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, 64-colour ambient lighting, a Burmester surround sound system, electrically adjustable seats with memory function, a wireless charger, a heads-up display, and more. Mercedes AMG CLE 53 Coupe engine and gearbox Twin-turbo straight-6 with mild hybrid system The AMG CLE 53 Coupe is equipped with a 3.0-litre twin-turbo straight-6 paired with a 48V mild-hybrid system, making for a combined output of 449hp and 560Nm (40Nm extra in the Overboost mode). A 9-speed dual-clutch gearbox funnels this grunt to all four wheels via Mercedes-AMG’s 4Matic+ system. 0-100kph in 4.2 seconds From a standstill, the AMG CLE 53 Coupe can hit 100kph in a claimed 4.2 seconds and go on to a top speed of 250kph, which can be increased to 270kph with the optional AMG Performance Package. Mercedes AMG CLE 53 Coupe price and rivals Will compete with BMW’s smallest M car Pricing for the AMG CLE 53 Coupe is expected to land around Rs 2 crore (ex-showroom). Once launched, the AMG CLE 53 Coupe will rival the BMW M2, which costs Rs 1.03 crore. All prices ex-showroom, India.

    "description": "The Bajaj-made Triumph Scrambler 400 X has been around for a couple of years, and while its sibling – the Speed 400 range – has seen some updates as well as the addition of the new T4 model, there hasn’t been much for the Scrambler, until now. Bajaj’s solution to spice things up for 2025 is the new Scrambler XC. In the big Scrambler 1200, the XC moniker meant more off-road capability, but that isn’t the case here. The XC is very similiar to the X in most fundamental ways. Triumph Scrambler 400 XC design and features - 8/10  Excel cross-spoke wheels look cool, replace the 400 X's alloys. Instead, the new Triumph Scrambler 400 XC gets a number of additional components, but none of it change the way it performs. The biggest upgrade, from both a visual and functional standpoint, would be the new cross-spoked wheels. Unlike the Akront wheels on the Himalayan 450, these are Excel rims, which is no bad thing considering that Excel is widely considered as one of the best in the business.  The 400 XC's tubeless cross-spoke wheels come from Excel. There is a significant change in the weight (it's up by five kilos to 190kg), which is because there are a number of other additions made to the bike. All of these are available as accessories on the Scrambler 400 X, which includes a colour-matched flyscreen, headlamp grille, a colour-matched tall front fender, a radiator guard, sump guard and lower engine crash guard. The collective effect is handsome and more purposeful looking, at least to my eyes. Weight and dimensionsKerb weight190kgGround clearance195mmSeat height 835mmFuel tank capacity13 litresWheelbase1418mm The lower engine guard is standard fitment on the 400 XC. Aside from these changes and a couple of unique colour schemes, the Scrambler 400 XC is pretty much the same when it comes to the riding experience. Theoretically, the lighter wheels should make some improvement in the agility, but it’s not a huge change; you’d have to ride both the X and XC back to back to tell if it’s really noticeable. The same goes for the extra 5kg the XC is carrying.  The 400 XC is the heaviest of all the Bajaj-made Triumph 400s. Triumph Scrambler 400 XC engine and performance - 8/10 Engine is smooth in the city but a little buzzy on the highway. As before, this bike’s liquid-cooled 40hp/37.5Nm 300cc engine feels smooth and punchy at lower revs, and a little buzzy post the triple-digit mark. Performance is strong and it’ll go past the indicated 160kph mark, but high-speed cruising isn’t what this bike is about. Short gearing means it’s smooth and tractable in the city but a little buzzy at fast highway speeds. Throttle response is smooth and predictable and the Scrambler is pleasant to ride within the city. Riding the Scrambler 400 XC is a pleasant affair in the city. EngineEngine399cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooledPower40hp at 8,000rpmTorque37.5Nm at 6,500rpmGearbox6-speed This city-friendly character is boosted by its 835mm seat height, which isn’t great for short riders but provides a very nice view of the road ahead. It also gives the slim Scrambler more of a comprehensive feeling compared to the compact Speed 400, which is otherwise the same size body-wise. The higher seat and more forward-set footpeg holders also result in a more relaxed knee position than on the Speed 400, and comfort is definitely a strong point here. The Scrambler continues to cut a handsome silhouette. Triumph is giving you all of this for Rs 26,000 more than the standard Scrambler, which is great value when you consider that buying just the wheels alone will set you back by Rs 70,000 at a Triumph service centre. As for existing Scrambler owners, yes, you can equip your bike with these if you don’t mind the huge price, but unfortunately, Bajaj says that doing so will void the warranty. The cross-spoke wheels can be equipped on the 400 X for a hefty sum of Rs 70,000. Triumph Scrambler 400 XC price and verdict - 8/10 Scrambler 400 XC is good VFM, but some areas could still be improved. While the value here is without doubt, there are some other areas that could have improved. For starters, the suspension is decently good for normal riding, but feels a little harsh when you ask too much of it either off road or at high corner speeds. However, what we really missed are better tyres and brakes. The MRF tyres used here are average at best and this bike deserves better. The same goes for the organic brake pads that result in dull brake bite and have widely been reported to have a very short life. PricePrice (ex-showroom, Delhi)Rs 2.94 lakh The front brake is quite dull and the MRF tyres are average. The reason these things stand out is because for just Rs 20,000 more, the updated KTM 390 Adventure X is far better equipped and offers a superior riding experience in terms of performance and capability. Then again, the KTM can’t match the Triumph’s classy appeal and if you’ve been swayed by the Scrambler’s handsome looks and all-round competence, we’d say the XC is worth the extra money.

    "description": "It’s always refreshing when riding gear blends into your routine without demanding attention, and over the past month or so, that’s exactly what the Raida UrbanR riding shoes have done. They’re pitched as casual shoes with light protection, and while that mostly holds true, there are a few nuances worth noting. Raida’s own website suggests going a size down, and I found this accurate. Thankfully, there’s almost no break-in needed – within two days, they felt quite natural. My usage was mostly city commutes with a few highway runs, and that’s where the UrbanRs shine. I wouldn’t use these for aggressive riding or off-road. But for everyday duties, they balance on-bike function with off-bike comfort. The top of the shoe can dig into your shin a bit if your bike has rear-set pegs, but overall comfort is decent. Despite Mumbai’s hot and humid weather, the mesh does its job. Protection-wise, there’s reinforcement at the ankle, heel and toe, plus SAS-TEC ankle inserts rated to EN13634. It’s not touring boot-level protection but good enough for city use. The ATOP dial and Velcro strap feel secure and hassle-free. Grip levels are fine on dry ground and on the bike, though not ideal on wet tiles or mossy sidewalks.  Glove-friendly lacing system can be used with one hand. They’ll handle a light drizzle, but anything more, and water seeps in – a natural trade-off for the breathability. That said, they’ve held up well, with no scuffing or visible wear, and they’re easy to clean. At Rs 7,000, they’re solid value when you consider most riding boots cost twice as much. You’re getting sneaker-like pricing with proper motorcycling protection. I’d recommend them to daily commuters or casual riders who are on their feet a lot. A small nitpick – the shoe looks a tad too bulky at the top, making the upper look a bit bulbous. Not a dealbreaker, but something to note. All in all, the Raida UrbanR is a well-rounded, commuter-focused riding shoe that nails the basics – comfort, breathability and light protection.
