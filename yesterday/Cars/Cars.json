    "description": "It has been a few months since you last read a Himalayan report, and I must take some of the blame. Between a prolonged period of illness and some intense travel, the bike hasn’t received the attention it should have. On top of this, it ended up being with RE for a couple of months when I sent it in to address some issues, and I didn’t push for it to be returned sooner. TFT is easy to read and legible even under harsh sunlight. The first of those issues was that the usually fiddly toggle switch for the display stopped working entirely and had to be replaced. I also wanted the company to permanently address the problem with the bike pulling to the right when the handlebar was released – something I’ve written about in the previous report. As I understand it, the second issue had something to do with rectifying various torque settings on bolts that connect the engine to the frame. The bike returned with working switchgear and the right-leaning problem almost entirely sorted out – it’s still marginally noticeable but no longer to a troubling extent. Switching modes on the Himalayan can be a task, given how often it’s denied. As soon as the Himalayan was back, I realised why I enjoyed it so much in the first place. Its big size, incredible suspension, and fantastic overall comfort are a class apart. But since this bike deserved some good running after such a long downtime, I gave it to Gavin for his ride down to IBW, and what you’ll read from hereon is his account. Our Himalayan is equipped with the optional touring seat, which was a boon on my nearly 1,200km ride to Goa and back. It was firm yet supportive and kept saddle soreness at bay for the majority of my journey. Thanks to its abundant mounting points, strapping a tail bag on is a piece of cake. A little more wind protection would have been nice, though. The carrier and grab rail make for perfect mounting points for all your luggage. My issues with the Himalayan are mostly nothing new. Despite being replaced, the switchgear is sometimes unresponsive. While this motor performs well, the high-speed vibrations can render your palms numb on long rides. The one quality issue is that the right mirror keeps coming loose, and its threads have now been damaged, meaning a new one will have to be purchased. Finally, the headlight offers adequate illumination, but most owners are better off getting auxiliary lights. The right mirror keeps coming loose, and the threading is now damaged.   Despite these shortcomings, the Himalayan is an excellent motorcycle with a handful of minor gripes. While I was fortunate not to have any punctures, the fear of one always looms over me. Thankfully, we will soon be getting a set of tubeless wheels installed. Before we end, our bike has developed the typical Himalayan loose steering cone set, and that’s something we’ll address in the next report.

    "description": "Few cars boast brand equity as strong as the Hyundai Creta. This formidable midsize SUV has long dominated its segment, thanks to its well-rounded packaging, feature-rich appeal and diverse powertrain options. Now, Hyundai has taken the winning Creta formula and electrified it, giving rise to the Creta Electric. The big question is if this battery-powered version can replicate the success of its internal combustion engine (ICE) counterpart. The Creta Electric is built on the ICE platform, but it has undergone significant reworking to accommodate its electric powertrain. The cabin floor sits slightly higher to make room for the battery pack, the suspension has been stiffened to handle the additional weight, and the front wheels are powered by an electric motor. Despite these changes, the Creta Electric retains the dimensions of its ICE sibling, including an impressive 200mm (unladen) ground clearance. An \"electric\" badge on the bootlid and pixelated accents on the bumper set this version apart from its ICE counterpart.   Hyundai Creta Electric exterior In terms of design, the Creta Electric takes inspiration from the Creta N Line, particularly at the front. The enclosed grille, featuring a pixelated theme reminiscent of the Ioniq 5, incorporates a centrally placed charging port. This pixelated motif extends to the closed front air dam, which includes active flaps to enhance aerodynamic efficiency. The 17-inch aero-style alloy wheels further emphasise its EV identity, and they come wrapped in lowrolling resistance, EV-specific tyres. Adding to its aesthetic appeal are silver highlights on the lower edges of the black plastic cladding, creating a striking contrast. Our dual-tone test unit featured black pillars, a black roof, and a black rear spoiler for added flair. Unique identifiers, such as an \"electric\" badge on the bootlid and pixelated accents on the rear bumper, set this version apart from its ICE counterpart. The sight of its battery pack beneath its body looks a bit ungainly, especially when viewed from the sides. Flaps on the front air dam automatically open and close to improve aerodynamic efficiency.   Hyundai Creta Electric interior Step into the Creta Electric’s cabin, and you’ll immediately notice its resemblance to the ICE version. However, several EV-specific upgrades make it distinct. A notable addition is the all-new three-spoke steering wheel with a circular horn boss, adorned with four dots symbolising the letter ‘H’ in Morse code. Interestingly, the steering buttons have been rearranged – the infotainment and phone controls are now on the right, while ADAS functions are on the left. New three-spoke steering wheel with a circular horn boss; four dots symbolise the letter ‘H’ in Morse code. The familiar 10.25-inch instrument cluster now features an additional cube-like theme, akin to the Ioniq 5. The air conditioning console – borrowed from the updated Alcazar – combines infotainment shortcuts with touch-sensitive keys, although practical physical toggles for temperature and a volume knob remain. A standout addition is the steering column-mounted drive selector, reminiscent of the Ioniq 5. This design frees up the centre console, which now adopts a floating style. It houses a drive mode button, an electric parking brake, an auto-hold button, ventilated front seat controls, and dual cupholders. Impressively, there’s a lower deck area beneath it which houses a fair bit of storage space. Even the armrest console is huge, and like the glovebox, it features a cooling vent to keep beverages cool. Lower deck area beneath the centre console houses a fair bit of storage space. In line with Hyundai’s sustainable focus, the seats are upholstered in eco-friendly materials derived from corn extracts and recycled plastic bottles. Surprisingly, the texture is smooth and closely resembles the leatherette used in the ICE model. The slightly higher floor impacts the driving position, which feels elevated even at its lowest setting. While rear seat space remains unchanged and is comfortable, the seating postureis slightly knees-up. A new boss-function allows rear passengers to electronically slide the front passenger seat forward, enhancing legroom. Utility trays on the front seatbacks include grooves for mobile devices and integrated pop-open cupholders for added convenience. You're seated in a slightly knees-up position, although it isn't uncomfortable. Additionally, the Creta Electric features a V2L (Vehicle-to-Load) system with a 3-pin power socket, enabling users to power devices like laptops or small appliances. Storage capacity remains practical with the unchanged 433-litre boot, complete with a spare tire under the boot floor. A 22-litre frunk provides extra loading space beneath the bonnet. 433-litre boot remains just as practical as the ICE version; gets a spare tyre beneath the floor, too.   Hyundai Creta Electric features Besides carrying forward the ICE version’s feature-set, the Electric gets some new equipment too, like rain-sensing wipers, electric front seats with driver’s seat memory, a cooling central console, boss seat function as well as front seatback-mounted utility trays. It carries forward the Autonomous Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) suite, which, like in the standard Creta, adds a safety net without feeling too intrusive in its function. Familiar 10.25-inch instrument cluster gets new cube-like display theme. Hyundai has invested heavily in developing an in-car payments option, which, with a mere touch, facilitates a wallet-based payment for vehicle charging, as well as future subscription-based features. In addition, the company has developed a first-of-its-kind mobile application through which users can not only identify and navigate to over 10,000 EV chargers across different brands but also make payments via the app to certain service providers. This eliminates the hassle of downloading and registering on multiple brand-specific applications. We’re still sore that like the standard Creta, it misses out on things like wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, adjustable front armrest, a headrest for the middle rear passenger, and the volume of its 8-speaker Bose setup is much lower at the rear than in the front. Also, compared to the large screens of its competitors, the Creta Electric’s 10.25-inch touchscreen comes across as a bit small. A new boss-function allows rear passengers to electronically slide the front passenger seat forward, enhancing legroom.   Hyundai Creta Electric performance The Creta Electric is offered with two battery options: a 42kWh pack and a 51.4kWh Long Range pack. Both utilise Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) cell chemistry, similar to the Ioniq 5. This type of battery is more compact and energy-dense than Lithium Ferrous Phosphate (LFP) batteries, although LFP batteries are known for their longer lifespan. For added peace of mind, Hyundai offers an 8-year/1,60,000km warranty on the battery, alongside the standard 3-year warranty on the car. The sight of its battery pack from the side looks a bit ungainly. Powering the Creta Electric is a single motor on the front axle that drives the front wheels. In the Long Range variant, this motor produces 171hp and 255Nm. Interestingly, its torque matches the diesel variant's 250Nm and is close to the turbo-petrol's 260Nm. However, being an EV, the power delivery is strong yet exceptionally linear. Acceleration feels brisk and effortless, even in its most efficient ‘Eco’ mode. The three drive modes – Eco, Normal and Sports – deliver noticeably different responses to part-throttle inputs, while flooring the accelerator unleashes the motor’s full potential. A synthesised bassy hum under hard acceleration adds a touch of drama to the otherwise silent drive. In our tests, the Creta Electric managed a 0-100kph time of 8.2 seconds, slightly behind the claimed 7.9 seconds. Flat out, it can achieve a top speed of 180kph. Acceleration feels brisk and effortless, but real-world range of over 400km impresses. The Creta gets a total of five regenerative braking options, with Level 1, 2 and 3 adjusting deceleration and bringing the car to a crawl.While these modes are mild, Levels 4 and 5 are strong. Drivers can also disable regenerative braking entirely for a free-rolling experience or opt for the ‘i-Pedal’ mode, which allows one-pedal driving by bringing the car to a complete stop without using the brake pedal. Each mode feels distinct and natural, making them intuitive to use. Adaptive cruise control integrates seamlessly with the regen system, adjusting braking automatically based on the situation, though drivers can override this using steering-mounted paddle shifters. Hyundai Creta Electric range and charging The 42kWh battery variant has an ARAI-certified range of 390km, while the 51.4kWh Long Range version offers 473km. In a mixed driving cycle of city and highway conditions, our preliminary test of the Long Range variant returned an impressive real-world range of approximately 426km. For reference, our 289.6km drive at an average speed of 41kph toggling through different drive and regenerative braking settings, utilised 68 percent of the charge. Charging port behind the enclosed front grille gets an LED indicator. Hyundai claims the battery can be charged from 10 to 80 percent in just 58 minutes using a 50kW DC fast charger. With a 11kW AC charger, the larger battery charges fully (10 to 100 percent) in 4 hours and 50 minutes, while the smaller battery completes this in 4 hours. Hyundai Creta Electric ride and handling To support the additional weight of the battery and motor, the Creta Electric’s suspension is stiffer than the ICE version’s. Remarkably, it doesn’t translate into a crashy or uncomfortable ride experience. Yes, you can feel its firmness at low speeds, and you’ll also hear its suspension ‘thwack’ over sharp bumps (particularly due to an otherwise silent cabin), but road shocks are still well in check. What’s nice is that the stiffness has eliminated unnecessary (secondary) body movements, and even at highway speeds, the Creta Electric doesn’t lose its poise. The steering, too, is noticeably heavier than the ICE version’s, and as a result, it warrants more effort at slow and parking speeds. But at no point does it feel excessive or cumbersome. And while it hasn’t resulted in more feel or feedback per se, the added weight only adds to the driver’s confidence, especially at high speeds or around a series of bends. Also nice is that the Creta Electric changes directions well, and with its weight being concentrated lower down, body roll seems to be far better controlled than the petrol-version. Notably, the Electric’s braking is so good, the transition from regenerative to frictional brakes feels extremely smooth and superbly calibrated, thus lending to a very natural brake pedal feel. Hyundai Creta Electric verdict The Creta Electric has its flaws – the ride is stiffer than the ICE version’s; the steering is a bit weighty; and finally, its floor is a bit raised, which results in a slightly knees-up position. But none of these are a dealbreaker. A standout addition is the steering column-mounted drive selector, akin to the Ioniq 5. The Electric version still retains the ICE’s brilliant packaging like its spacious cabin, ample practicality, and a decently sized boot – it gets a frontal loading area (frunk), too. Performance is smooth, linear and reasonably quick. But what’s even more impressive is its real-world range of over 400km, with reasonable charging times. And even though its suspension is firmer than the ICE Creta’s, it gets a newfound confidence in the ride and handling department. Typical to the Creta’s proposition, this electric iteration is feature-rich, too. At a price ranging between Rs 18 lakh and Rs 23.50 lakh, the Creta Electric comes across as a fantastic EV. Will it replicate the ICE's success? If first impressions are anything to go by, the Creta Electric seems to have what it takes to dominate the EV space.

    "description": "Kia India has deleted the diesel-iMT powertrain option from the Sonet, Seltos and Carens. However, the iMT gearbox continues to be available with all three models’ turbo-petrol engine versions. Kia has also slightly rejigged the variant line-up of all three cars, so let’s look closer at the MY2025 updates. Kia Sonet Sonet MY2025 variant line-up. Kia used to offer the Sonet with a diesel-iMT powertrain in the HTX and HTX+ trims; the latter has been discontinued. Now, Kia has introduced the HTK+(O) trim, which sits between the HTK(O) and HTX trims and is available with the 1.2-litre petrol-MT and 1.0-litre turbo-petrol-iMT powertrains. Kia has also dropped the Gravity Edition models from the Sonet line-up. Prices for the Sonet currently range between Rs 8.00 lakh and Rs 15.70 lakh. Kia Seltos Seltos MY2025 variant line-up. In the Seltos line-up, only the mid-spec HTX trim came with the diesel-iMT powertrain, which is not available anymore. Like in the Sonet, Seltos’ Gravity Edition stands discontinued. However, Kia has introduced three new trims: HTK(O), HTK+(O) and HTX (O), with some reshuffling of features as well. Also, the GT Line comes only in fully loaded GTX+ trim instead of GTX and GTX+ trims. The Seltos’ prices range between Rs 11.13 lakh and Rs 20.51 lakh.     Kia Carens Carens MY2025 variant line-up. In the Carens, apart from removing the diesel-iMT powertrain, Kia delisted the Luxury trim, with six- and seven-seater configurations. Also, the petrol-iMT powertrain is available in fewer trims now, and the diesel-AT can be only had in the Prestige Plus (O) trim. Lastly, the X-Line trim, previously available in both turbo-petrol-DCT and diesel-AT versions, is now only available with the former. Interestingly, though, the Carens’ Gravity Edition continues to be available. Prices for the Carens are in the Rs 10.60 lakh-Rs 19.70 lakh range.  Also See: Kia Carnival Hi Limousine on display at Auto Expo 2025 Kia EV6 facelift debuts at Auto Expo 2025",

    "description": "Dacia names new VP for marketing, sales and operations Welcome to Movers and Shakers, a new Autocar Business feature covering the latest job moves from across the automotive industry. This page will be updated regularly with all the biggest transfers, promotions and departures in the sector, covering everything you need to know. Name: Frank Marotte Company: Dacia Role: Vice-president for marketing, sales and operations Dacia has named Frank Marotte its new vice-president for marketing, sales and operations. Marotte was previously the president and managing director of Toyota France, overseeing both the Toyota and Lexus brands. He started his career in automotive with Peugeot in 1993. He replaces Xavier Martinet, who left Dacia last year to lead Hyundai's European operations. Marotte will begin his new job on 1 February. Names: Giuseppe Cava, Damien Dally, Nicola Dobson, Tom Ray, Nick Richards Company: Stellantis UK Roles: Managing director for Fiat, Fiat Professional and Abarth (Cava), brand director for Leapmotor (Dally), managing director for Peugeot (Dobson), B2B director (Ray) and pre-owned vehicles director (Richards) Stellantis has revised its UK management team, appointing new managing directors for the Abarth, Fiat and Peugeot brands. Giuseppe Cava, who was most recently the UK marketing director for Fiat and Abarth, replaces Damien Dally as the sibling brands' managing director. Dally moves into the role of brand director for Chinese debutant Leapmotor. Nicola Dobson, previously the director of pre-owned vehicles, replaces Eurig Druce as Peugeot managing director following his promotion to managing director of Stellantis UK. Nick Richards takes on Dobson's former role. Tom Ray, who joined Stellantis in 2004, has been appointed B2B operations director for the UK. All will report to Druce. Name: David Beattie Company: Mini UK and Ireland Role: Director David Beattie has been named the new director for Mini UK and Ireland, replacing Federico Izzo, who has been promoted to lead the brand's European operations. Beattie has worked for the BMW Group UK since 2005 and most recently led its used car sales operation. Names: Sjoerd Knipping, Pablo Martinez Masip Company: Kia Europe Roles: Chief operating officer (Knipping), vice-president of product and marketing (Martinez Masip) Kia Europe has appointed a new chief operating officer and vice-president of product and marketing. Sjoerd Knipping (above, left), the new COO, has been promoted from his previous role as vice-president of product and marketing. He has spent more than 25 years working in the European automotive industry, having held several senior roles at Kia and Ford. Replacing Knipping as the vice-president of product and marketing is Pablo Martinez Masip (above, right), who has been Kia's global VP for customer experience since 2021. \"Going forward, our strong team supported by these executives will continue to move our bold transformation process to be a sustainable mobility solutions provider with a focus on our people and our customers,\" said Marc Hedrich, president and CEO of Kia Europe. Name: Christian Meunier Company: Nissan Role: Chairperson of the management committee for the Americas Former CEO of Jeep Christian Meunier has been named the new chairman of Nissan's management committee in the Americas. He will report directly to Nissan's new chief performance officer, Guillaume Cartier, who was appointed to right the ship after the firm's operating profits dropped by 90% during the first half of its 2024 financial year. Challenges facing Meunier include the threat of a 25% tariff on its cars exported into the US from Mexico, as well as a profitability slide that was in part caused by liberal discounting in the region. He spent 17 years with Nissan (between 2002 and 2019) before taking the top job at Jeep. He left the American manufacturer in October 2023 to \"take a long break to focus on personal interests\", according to an official Stellantis statement. Name: Damien O'Sullivan Company: VW Group UK Role: Managing director Volkswagen Group UK has named Damien O'Sullivan as its new managing director, with Alex Smith leaving after six years at the helm.  O'Sullivan will take the top job in Milton Keynes on 1 December, having run Audi in Ireland for the past three years. Prior to that, he spent time in various positions within the VW Group in China and Taiwan, having joined the company's sales division in 2009. Smith, who has been with the VW Group UK for nearly 15 years, is leaving the company \"at his own request\", according to an official statement.  His tenure as VW Group UK MD has coincided with one of the most turbulent and disruptive periods in automotive history, but he leaves the company in a strong position ahead of a transformative few years in which each of its brands are planning to launch crucial new models to the UK market. \"I’m very proud of everything the team and the networks have achieved in a period which has included Brexit, a pandemic, a supply crisis and the introduction of mass-market electromobility,\" said Smith.  \"With Volkswagen the UK’s number one passenger car brand, Audi at number two and both Skoda and Seat/Cupra achieving record market shares so far this year, as well as Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles in number two position in the van market, it feels like the right time to hand over to Damien to continue building on Volkswagen Group’s market leading performance in the UK.\" Name: Xavier Martinet Company: Hyundai Europe Role: President and CEO Dacia marketing chief Xavier Martinet will become the next president and CEO of Hyundai Europe. Martinet replaces Michael Cole, who is retiring at the end of this year after four years in the top job. Cole, who has been with the Hyundai Motor Group since 2009, said: “After more than 40 years in the automotive industry, it is now time to return to the UK to be with my family and to enjoy life beyond work. “I have been incredibly fortunate to enjoy a career in such a dynamic industry and over the last 15 years to work at Hyundai Motor Group, the best and most progressive automotive organisation in the world. “I am proud to have worked with a great team in Europe, who l know will ensure that Hyundai continues its exciting growth trajectory.” Name: Christophe Georges  Company: Bentley  Role: Board member for sales and marketing Bentley has promoted sales and marketing director Christophe Georges to a seat on its executive board.  Georges joined Bentley in 1998 and has held several key positions since, including two stints as its president and CEO for the Americas region.  “I am relishing the prospect of continuing to work closely with my colleagues to provide fresh momentum and direction as we grow our brand, our audience base and our entire sales and marketing operations,” said Georges. Bentley CEO Frank-Steffen Walliser added that Georges is “perfectly placed to realise our brand and sales ambitions”.  Name: James Crichton Company: Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Role: Regional director for the Middle East and Africa James Crichton has been named Rolls-Royce’s next regional director for the “hugely important” Middle East and Africa region.  Crichton has held a number of senior positions at the luxury car maker since 2010 and has worked as the general manager of its global sales operations for the past six years. Julian Jenkins, Rolls-Royce’s director of sales and brand, said: “I am delighted to welcome James Crichton to his new role as regional director Middle East and Africa. “James has more than 14 years of experience with Rolls-Royce Motor Cars and has held several leading positions in the company during this time. “This latest move to Dubai reunites him with the regional office he was asked to establish in 2011. “Middle East and Africa is a hugely important region for our business, and I wish James continued success in his role leading the excellent team which serves the region.” Name: Maria Grazia Davino Company: BYD Role: Regional managing director for Germany, Switzerland, Poland, Austria and the Czech Republic Maria Grazia Davino has been announced as the new regional managing director for BYD in Germany, Switzerland, Poland, Austria and the Czech Republic. The news comes days after she stepped down as managing director of Stellantis UK – a position she held since July 2023. Stella Li, executive vice-president of BYD, said: “We are thrilled to welcome Maria Grazia to our team. Her extensive experience and visionary leadership will be pivotal as we continue to grow and innovate in the European automotive landscape.” Name: Eurig Druce Company: Stellantis UK Role: Managing director Eurig Druce has been named the next managing director of Stellantis UK, replacing Maria Grazia Davino. Druce has worked in what is now Stellantis since 2001, having started as an apprentice with Peugeot UK in 2001. He spent three years heading Citroën’s British arm between 2020 and 2023 before serving as sales chief for Stellantis UK. He was named Peugeot UK boss in July 2024 and will continue in that role until his replacement is found. Jean-Philippe Imparato, who was recently named Stellantis’s new chief operating officer for the Enlarged Europe region, said: “I am delighted to be able to appoint Eurig Druce to this position. His proven track record in the country will provide continuity of our strategy in this important market.”",

    "description": "The biometric system uses 3D distance mapping to detect the driver’s exact position Continental displayed the latest version of its biometrics in-car tech at the Consumer Electronics Show. Called the Invisible Biometrics Sensing Display, it aims to improve passive safety for a car’s occupants.   Biometrics is the science of recognition using biological characteristics and this system goes further by detecting occupants using a camera and laser projector. The technology looks through a high-resolution OLED screen and is invisible to the naked eye. It was developed by Continental in conjunction with its partner, Trinamix. This latest version uses 3D distance mapping to ensure the airbags are deployed to the best effect in the event of a collision and it checks other restraint devices too – for example, that seatbelts are fastened correctly. The Invisible Biometric Sensing Display can also monitor vital parameters such as the driver’s heart rate to identify stressful situations or even an impending medical emergency. The imaging technology at the core of it consists of a 1.5-megapixel near-infrared camera and a laser dot projector that poses no danger to the occupants’ eyes. Also developed by Trinamix, the system works by capturing reflections from points of light emitted by the projector. Occupants are unaware of it happening because the wavelengths used are all within the invisible light spectrum. The technology also captures other information, such as the distance of the driver to the instrument panel. Unsurprisingly, the engine room behind the optical devices is powered by algorithms based on artificial intelligence. The biometric imaging technology was developed specifically for use in car interiors, uses a single hardware module and, as such, Continental claims it is unique in the market. The developers also believe that because the system is contactless and invisible to a car’s occupants, it should open up new creative opportunities for designers and be more readily accepted by users. Other driver monitoring systems have been around for some time, of course. Bosch markets a drowsiness detection system based on an algorithm that starts recording the driver’s steering behaviour from the moment they pull away. Based on the frequency and pattern of the driver inputs and other things such as the length of journey, use of indicators and the time of day, the algorithms can calculate the driver’s level of fatigue and issue a warning.  Mercedes-Benz was the first to offer a drowsiness detection system, with Attention Assist in 2009. If it concludes the driver needs a wake-up call, it will issue the audible and visual prompt: “Time for a break.”",

If this is the first non-mechanized review you’ve read on Bike EXIF, let me get you up to speed. Whiskey Wednesday is a phenomenon that started after hours here at the Bike EXIF headquarters as a gathering of like-minded individuals. Bikes, cars and every form of mechanical banter make for engaging conversation, aided by moderately priced spirits and degrading sarcasm. We’re not pros with cellars full of exotics, but instead, regular guys who appreciate a neat glass and friendly trash talk. Today’s whiskey comes from a friend of a friend who donated a fresh bottle for the coveted WW review.…",

Sure, a car’s design, or its smell, or its sound can be part of that attraction, but a bigger part lies within something more abstract. If there was ever anyone who could relate to such an emotion, it would be Rob Simon. His steed of choice has been, and always will be, the legendary BMW E30 M3. In the automotive space, the legendary Bavarian warrior needs no introduction or backstory. It has long been heralded as one of the most exceptional machines ever sculpted by mankind, offering a pure driving experience unmarred by unnecessary aids or features. Despite a near-death experience in his red E30 M3, Rob always lusted for another one. It wasn’t just the behind-the-wheel time he longed for but the deeper, unspoken connection it wove between him, his father, and his brother, all of which had E30 M30s of their own. That chance would thankfully arise once more, but not in the way he would expect. Tune in to the Petrolicious YouTube channel and relive Rob Simon’s BMW E30 M3 tale alongside us.
