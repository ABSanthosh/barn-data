    "description": "This 1952 Allard J2X is one of approximately 80 examples produced and was completed in November 1951 before being dispatched to Motor Sport Inc. in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Chassis 2193 was purchased in 1973 by an Ohio owner who subsequently commissioned a refurbishment that included a color change to yellow. They retained the car until 2010, when it was sold part-way through a refresh that was completed under subsequent ownership. The car later underwent a refurbishment between 2023 and early 2024 that included a repaint in black and a re-trim of the interior in dark green leather. Following completion of the project, the car won its class at the 2024 Keeneland Concours d’Elegance before being purchased by the selling dealer. Power is provided by a 354ci Chrysler FirePower V8 that breathes through twin four-barrel carburetors and is mated to a three-speed manual transmission. Additional equipment includes alloy drum brakes with inboard rear units, a De Dion rear axle, a front swing axle with forward-facing radius rods, chrome 16” wire wheels, a side-mount spare, and an engine-turned dashboard. This J2X is now offered in Huntington Station, New York, with a removed banjo-spoke steering wheel, a spare set of bright wire wheels, photos and invoices from the 2023-2024 refurbishment, hand-written notes and documentation from the previous long-term owner, and a clean Kentucky title.",

With such a tenure comes a measure of consistency; the man behind the Mule Motorcycles moniker never disappoints. Although Mule is best known for his impeccable Harley flat trackers, he does just as well with other marques too. His latest project is a 2005 KTM 525 EXC with an erratic backstory and one heck of an attitude. “It started out as a ‘well used’ trail bike that was street plated,” Mule explains. “I bought it two years ago, with the intention of turning it into my personal motocrosser. Then I got a call from a customer that I had previously built a Harley XR1000 for; he wanted a street supermoto build.”…",

    "description": "Merger with Forseven will see McLaren expand beyond mid-engined supercars Forseven has existed in the shadows – until now, as it forms the Manchester City of the car world Ten minutes and 26 seconds into our conversation, the bombshell drops: “What I can say now is that we will merge Forseven and McLaren. It will all exist under a McLaren umbrella.” We had speculated as such in our reporting of Forseven previously, but to hear the words come out of the mouth of Forseven CEO Nick Collins made for quite a jaw-dropping moment. Wow, this is big! Collins had been one of the faces of JLR over the past decade, but had joined the previously almost mythical Forseven 15 months ago and disappeared from public view. He's made quite the return. Forseven had been operating differently to most start-ups in being almost entirely secretive, its only visible presence a holding web page and LinkedIn profiles of its ever-increasing staff listing it as their employer. Most start-ups are noisy, building hype and therefore trying to attract investment. Forseven didn't need to do that as it is entirely funded by an investment arm of the Abu Dhabi state, McLaren effectively becoming the Manchester City of the car world. It means business, and the acquisition and now turbocharging of McLaren Automotive is a quite stunning development.  “We didn't need to go big and bold, and say come fund us,” says Collins. “Our backers were already in place.” Indeed, as becomes clear in our conversation, Collins is not understating things when he says “we are much further down the line than most people think we are”. Collins was attracted by the scale of the ambition of CYVN Holdings, leaving a board role at JLR, but having “always wanted to be the CEO of something”, it was a chance to not only do that but “build a legacy” in the process.  “As reserved Brits, we get shy of being ambitious,” he says. “I genuinely felt we had the right ingredients coming together… That, while everybody else is hunkering down, gave us an opportunity to be aggressive going forwards. \"This is an amazing opportunity to have a once-in-a-lifetime crack with some talented people to leave something for generations to come.” He references on a few occasions that CYVN “makes decisions faster than I've ever seen in any business”. While CYVN provides stability, financial or otherwise, that decisiveness allows for great flexibility, typified by Forseven’s go-to-market strategy to be as ballsy as to merge with McLaren. Collins also speaks highly of the culture at Forseven, and that good culture creates good cars. Plus, the “cars that have been awful pretty much universally had a bad team”. He's raring to kick-start this new era for the great name of McLaren, and while Forseven has no history of its own, it does actually have a link to McLaren's past, for what was founder Bruce McLaren's racing number? 47.",

    "description": "Forseven merger will bring a broader line-up, here imagined by Autocar Full interview with CEO as British firm sets its sights on dramatic expansion beyond mid-engined supercars McLaren Automotive is to merge with the start-up company Forseven in a bombshell move that will enable McLaren to expand beyond making mid-engined supercars for the first time. The move secures the future of McLaren, giving it the capital, technology and resources to go into areas of the market it has not been able to finance itself.   Forseven is a British start-up that has been quietly assembling a team of more than 700 industry professionals, among them big-name designers, engineers and executives from rival British car companies, and has been building towards the launch of a range of luxury models under a new brand.  The common link between the two companies is the Abu Dhabi government-backed investment company CYVN Holdings, which has facilitated a merger operating under the McLaren Automotive name that will enable the models in development at Forseven to come to market under the McLaren badge. This gives Forseven a shortcut to market, and McLaren the expansion and security it craves and the ability to better compete with the likes of Ferrari, Lamborghini, Aston Martin and Bentley. The official announcement confirms an Autocar story from February, which revealed a merger was being planned between McLaren Automotive and Forseven to enable McLaren to expand beyond its range of supercars.  The new combined company, McLaren Group Holdings, will be led by Forseven CEO Nick Collins who – in his only interview with an automotive title – told Autocar that “we’re about to embark on the most exciting British automotive story in decades”. Collins was previously a senior engineer at Ford and latterly JLR, where he oversaw the likes of the Defender and Range Rover. The Forseven name had never been intended as a customer-facing brand, and will cease to exist. “It’s just a holding name, and we’ve been building at an incredible pace,” said Collins, who took up the role of Forseven CEO in January last year.  The first official details of the new-era McLarens will be revealed later this year, with Collins promising “a bigger-bang event” that goes beyond this initial corporate announcement.  In the meantime, the company says work will \"commence immediately\" on a six-month turnaround of the existing McLaren Automotive business. He declined to go into specifics in terms of any of the models planned but confirmed it was a range of cars in the luxury market at higher price points, which would make for a broader portfolio of McLaren models than exists today. Our artist’s renderings accompanying this story imagine what some of those cars might look like.  “It’s not as challenging as you think to explore how the design language of this brand [McLaren] could evolve in the future and still maintain everything that they’ve already done and a lot more,” said Collins. Design work is being overseen by Alister Whelan, an ex-JLR colleague of Collins. Before Collins arrived at Forseven in January 2024, design models and feasibility studies for models had been created but “we have evolved a long way since then”. The design team is made up of around 50 people and Collins said their output was “staggering” over the past 12 months, with virtual reality being used alongside physical models to allow design work to take place 24/7 with a further team based in Australia alongside the UK operation. “They’re really looking into the fundamental building blocks of British design,” he said. “There are some amazingly consistent elements of British design, and particularly British luxury design, that permeate British brands. We’ve taken that, plus some McLaren influence, into where we’re going to go.” Prior to the McLaren deal, it had been Forseven’s intention to go to market as its own brand, albeit not called Forseven, and it had been working on different brands and names.  Intriguingly, the models that have been in creation at Forseven are not solely electric (an easy assumption to make, given its website URL is forseven-ev.com) and McLaren’s expansion into other segments will include high-performance internal combustion engines. Collins said: “The future of propulsion is multi-propulsion. The more luxurious the vehicle gets, the better electric is for it because it’s quieter, more refined. So it will play a role. “We genuinely think you can make a brilliant electric car in certain segments, but through the way the world is transiting at different paces in different parts of the world, we will have different propulsion technologies to allow us to grow in the right way.” Another one of CYVN’s investments is in Chinese electric car maker Nio. Collins said a technology licence existed between Forseven and Nio “that we have incorporated into the cars” but it was for specific “technology chunks” rather than for an architecture on which to base the cars as buying in architectures was “the graveyard of car projects”.  “We’ll be deploying [the technology] in a very unique way that’s specific to what we’re trying to achieve; think of it as an accelerator to what we do,” said Collins. Based on that description, examples of the technology that Forseven could use from Nio for future McLarens are its autonomous driving features and its battery-swapping technology for electric cars. And when it comes to architectures, McLaren’s experience in composites is likely to come into play. CYVN has also acquired Gordon Murray Technologies, which includes the rights for the iStream manufacturing process. This process is more cost effective than traditional manufacturing and allows for lighter vehicle weight. Collins said “the spirit” of the process would be used for production in the future and “research projects are ongoing” to that end. Vehicle development is a huge part of what GMT does, and its engineers are sure to be playing a leading role in developing this new era of McLarens. Collins said Forseven was looking at the evolution of luxury brands in other markets – for example, Louis Vuitton moving into selling trainers – as a way of broadening and redefining what the types of cars companies like McLaren can make and sell. To that end, Forseven was “trying to think a bit more luxury than automotive in exploring what we do”. Collins said: “We have to overcome that British reserve: why can’t you do that? Automotive wisdom might say you can’t do this at this time, but luxury wisdom in adjacent segments would say you can. “The worst thing we could do is fail to try. We’re not going to be reckless or stupid. But expect us to be a little bit unconventional in how we do it.” Indeed, Collins hinted that Forseven could even look to revive vehicle types from the past. He cited the Defender 90 as an example of a car where outwardly it seemed “the three-door car market was dead” but “if you get the car right, then it will recreate a market or generate a market”. “If you get the cars right, you will distort the market, because you will drag people from other luxury brands or drag people up who will do whatever they can to get the car, and you’ll create success through that,” added Collins. “I fundamentally believe success comes from great products and if you don’t have great products, it doesn’t matter what you write down as your ambition as it’s not going to happen.” Collins promised cutting-edge technology for the new McLarens and would “play a huge role” in everything the brand does, including in the hardware and software underpinning the car. “Whether it's a direct or indirect relationship, technology plays a role,” he said. “It might be manufacturing technology in terms of how you build the car that gives it a certain weight level [iStream]. It might be technology that gives it performance, quietness, connectivity, or active safety. People buy a package. “I also believe when you enter segments that you've not been in before, brand advantage is good. Design advantage is good. Everything else we underpin with technology.” More broadly on the new company and the emergence of CYVN in the automotive industry, Collins said “this is not a vanity project”. “This is a financial investment that we will build out and, in my mind, become one of the best, if not the best car company in the world,” he said. “That might take a very long time, but the people that back this have a long-term horizon for a sustainably profitable business that is admired around the world. “I’m sure there will be plenty of people out there throwing rocks at it and saying it can’t be done, and such and such can’t happen. But I really want this to be something that Britain can become very proud of.” McLaren merges with Forseven: the biggest questions What is CYVN Holdings? It is an investment arm of the Abu Dhabi state, with what Collins calls “a remit to invest in advanced mobility”. It formed Forseven as an anchor investment in 2022, and has expanded its automotive portfolio since then. It paid $2.2 billion (£1.7bn) for a 20% stake in Chinese company Nio in late 2023, and Collins sits on the Nio board as part of its stake holding. It bought Gordon Murray Technologies in 2023, and it also acquired the rights for GMT’s innovative ‘iStream’ production process as part of that deal.  CYVN acquired McLaren Automotive in December 2024, and it was Collins, who also acts as an automotive advisor to CYVN, who around a year ago first suggested it looked at the Woking-based supercar maker to help realise Forseven’s ambitions. The merger was always the intention, and has been formally in the works since then. CYVN took a non-controlling stake in McLaren Racing as part of that deal. Who is Nick Collins? Collins is one of the most prominent engineers in the industry. He left a board role at JLR to join Forseven as CEO. His nine-year career at JLR culminated with the job of executive director for vehicle programmes. At JLR, he has played a key role in the development of all its current models, including the Range Rover and Defender, as well as development work on the future range of electric Jaguars. Prior to JLR, Collins spent two decades at Ford, overseeing development of the likes of the Fiesta ST. Should we consider this ‘new McLaren’ a British brand?  While the financing comes from Abu Dhabi, all other operations and key development sites are very much British. To that end, the new McLaren is no different to the German-owned Bentley and Rolls-Royce. Or indeed the Bahrain-owned McLaren previously. Even before McLaren’s emergence in the project, Forseven was creating models that would have been part of a “British luxury brand”. “We wanted to make a British brand, and I had a very clear perspective of where I felt Britain as an automotive nation excels and where we should play with the business,” said Collins. Where will McLaren now be based? Forseven has three units including a new design centre opening in Bicester, Oxfordshire soon. It also has offices in Leamington Spa, unsurprisingly given the volume of talent it has attracted from neighbour JLR. All McLaren facilities at Woking, along with its composites factory in Yorkshire, will be retained, and the companies will be integrated together rather than run separately. Collins favours the Bicester location as a central hub between the Midlands and London/south-east, allowing It to attract a wider talent pool. Further facilities are at Shalford, near Guildford, where the Gordon Murray Technologies operation is currently run. Collins said the new company “would probably look to rationalise our footprint over time”, yet all facilities would be retained for now. Collins would not confirm where the Forseven-derived McLarens would be built, only ruling out China as one option. How many cars will McLaren make? Collins declined to comment on volume projects and, regardless, “personally, I don’t like judging car companies by volume”. “I’d much rather think about value, and where we can generate value with this brand and this portfolio of cars,” he added. “The volume will take care of itself after that and I’m not interested in pushing against a specific target. In the luxury world, you don’t really want to talk about how many things you sell, you want to talk about the value you create and experiences you deliver to your consumers.” McLaren itself sold just over 2000 supercars last year, and based on the way the likes of Ferrari and Lamborghini have bolstered their sales beyond 10,000 thanks to additional model lines, this could be a long-term figure Forseven could get to given the likely pricing and positioning of the new models. The 7000 sales Aston Martin is targeting per year would be a more likely number to pass in the medium term for McLaren. What will happen to Forseven as we know it today? In fairly short order, it will cease to exist and McLaren is the name it will be known by. Forseven is a company name for now, but one that has been working in the background and with no real public-facing presence and close to zero awareness in wider public consciousness apart from those in the industry. Collins said that creating and building a new brand was the biggest risk facing Forseven in going to market, and what it saw with McLaren was “an incredible opportunity to actually adapt what we were doing to build out something that has incredible potential”. What will happen to the existing McLaren team and leadership? The McLaren Group has around 3500 staff including the racing team, and the number working across its Automotive division that CYVN has acquired is around 2000-2500.  Collins is promising a full integration of the two companies and they will operate as one. He acknowledges that “change is always difficult” and he said the two companies had spent a lot of time already “looking at where we are similar and where we are different”. When asked what would happen to existing McLaren Automotive boss Michael Leiters, Collins said he would not comment on specific roles but said that he and Leiters had noted that the two companies’ leadership teams had “got on extremely well, extremely quickly”. Will there be job cuts? While the intention is to ultimately grow in size in the newly expanded McLaren, Collins said it was “too early to say” if there would be job cuts due to overlap following the merger: “What I’ve said to everybody [at McLaren] is that we’ve got to improve short-term performance – that’s clear. And, frankly, at Forseven we can improve things on efficiency and how we’re allocating resources for what we’re getting done as well.” He referred several times to “one plus one equalling more than two” in bringing together the entities of Forseven and McLaren to unlock additional growth and opportunities on both sides. Would the expansion of Lotus be a fair comparison to what has happened with Forseven and McLaren? On the face of it, it seems similar: sports car maker gets taken over and then starts to make other vehicle types. But Forseven and McLaren will be integrated as one company in one country, whereas Lotus effectively operates as two companies: a sports car arm in Norfolk, and larger electric cars from China. Very little DNA exists between the two arms, either. Forseven is promising something very different. Who else is involved at Forseven? The Forseven team is made up of more than 700 individuals (and it works with more than that number again through external partners), largely recruited from other car makers. That number has grown from around 250 at the start of 2024.  Alister Whelan, formerly of JLR and an ex-colleague of Collins, heads up the design team. Around half of the 700 Forseven team work in R\u0026D. It has used headhunters, recruitment partners and the likes of professional networking site LinkedIn to help build the Forseven staff. Other prominent team members include ex-Lotus bosses Mike Johnstone and Conor Horne, who are commercial director and director of commercial readiness at Forseven respectively.   Intriguingly, ex-McLaren CEO Mike Flewitt had been working with Forseven and Gordon Murray Technologies for the past year but according to his LinkedIn profile he left that role in February.  How will this link to the Formula 1 team? Perhaps more than now. CYVN’s McLaren Automotive deal included a non-controlling stake in the McLaren Racing arm, whose F1 team is the reigning champion.  “The racing team is doing a phenomenal job at the moment, so the global awareness of the brand is incredible,” said Collins. “I want to get the awareness of the automotive part of the business to the same scale and value as the racing is, but that’s not about hitting a headline volume.” Collins noted how the racing team had moved into other categories, including Indycar and Formula E, and made the comparison for the road car division to do the same, moving from supercars to other vehicle types. “Customers want to be in different categories,” said Collins. “Why can’t they have a [McLaren] W1 in the garage, and something else they use every day? We want people to attach to a brand and an experience.”",

    "description": "Maruti Suzuki and Honda have given their compact sedans a significant update, bringing us the fourth-generation Dzire and the third-generation Amaze, respectively. Can these sedans carry on the fight in an increasingly SUV-dominated market? With these new-gen models, both brands have also placed a strong emphasis on safety this time around. Standard features on both cars now include ESP, six airbags and hill-start assist. Additionally, the Amaze stands out with its camera-based ADAS suite, while the Dzire has earned a 5-star Global NCAP crash-safety rating. And now, with similar features and specifications, the two sedans are closer than ever. So, we put their petrol-automatic iterations through our exhaustive tests to find out which one comes out on top. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire exterior design Amaze boasts a higher ground clearance and a longer wheelbase. The Amaze follows Honda’s latest design philosophy, bearing a strong resemblance to its larger siblings. Its front shares styling cues with the Elevate SUV, while the rear resembles the City. Though the side profile remains unmistakably Amaze, elements such as door-mounted mirrors and 185/60 R15 diamond-cut alloys provide a modern touch. The new Dzire impresses with its large Audi-esque grille, and the LED headlamps look sleek. Like the Amaze, its side profile is familiar to its previous generation, but distinctive tail-lights featuring a tri-arrow LED signature and a subtle boot lip spoiler add character. Dzire is taller, but Amaze has a higher ground clearance Dimensionally, both cars are near-identical in length and width, but the Dzire is 25mm taller and rides on slightly higher-profile 185/65 R15 tyres. The Amaze boasts a 20mm longer wheelbase and higher ground clearance (172mm versus Dzire’s 163mm). The Dzire AMT weighs 960kg, making it 26kg lighter than the Amaze. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire interior Honda’s hallmark ergonomics shine through, and its high-set seats result in excellent visibility. With a dashboard that resembles that of an Elevate, the Amaze’s interior adopts a minimalist approach. The beige-black colour scheme adds some brightness, and Honda’s hallmark ergonomics shine through with well-placed storage spaces and excellent visibility. Also carried forward from the Elevate are its superbly executed part-analogue, part-digital instrument cluster and the neat, buttoned climate control console. Where the Amaze must improve is the front-seat comfort; the absence of adequate seat base support becomes glaringly evident in this comparison. Its rear seat fares much better in this aspect – there’s good support, and the backrest angle is more comfortable than the Maruti. Three fixed headrests not only improve comfort but also provide whiplash protection to adults seated here. And while neither of these sedans is wide enough to seat three adults comfortably, the Amaze’s rear air-con console protrudes a fair bit into the middle passenger’s kneeroom. Also, taller passengers will find the headroom in limited supply in the Amaze. Dzire interior feels more spacious and comfortable Some textured bits enhance its appeal, as do features like a larger screen and sunroof. There’s a greater sense of space inside the Dzire due to its design and lighter colour scheme. Some smartly executed textured bits lift its appeal, while its larger 9-inch touchscreen and a sunroof add a touch of modernity. It also gets an edge over the Amaze due to its broader, more supportive seats. For short drives, its soft cushioning feels very comfortable, too. However, this could induce some body ache after spending extended hours in the car during long drives. Its rear seat is just as accommodating as the Honda’s, but with a bit more headroom due to a scooped-out roof, taller passengers will be comfier here. While both cars have ample storage areas spread across the cabin, the Dzire’s 382-litre boot is a bit smaller than the Amaze’s, which measures 416 litres. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire price and features Amaze (clockwise): Camera-based ADAS works well under most conditions; The front seats’ base is small and needs better support; Rear AC console eats into the kneeroom of passengers; Smooth transmission complements its engine well. The Honda Amaze CVT comes in three variants priced between Rs 9.35 lakh and Rs 11.20 lakh, whereas the Dzire AMT’s range of Rs 8.34 lakh to Rs 10.19 lakh makes it significantly more affordable. The features common to their top trims include auto LED headlamps, 15-inch alloys, keyless entry, wireless charging, automatic climate control, rear air vents, cruise control, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, ESP and six airbags. Dzire (clockwise): Includes in-vogue features like a sunroof and a 360-deg cam; The AMT gearbox’s shifts are jerky; No headrest for the middle passenger; Faux wood, silver inserts and textures enhance its appeal. The Dzire AMT stands out with a 360-degree camera, a sunroof and a larger 9-inch touchscreen (compared to the Amaze’s 8-inch unit). However, during our tests, its screen froze on more than one occasion while connected to Android Auto. Amaze distinguishes itself with ADAS features For the Rs 1 lakh premium that the Amaze CVT commands over the Dzire AMT, it gets paddle shifters, a part-digital instrument cluster, and an ADAS package featuring lane-keeping assist, blind-spot monitoring, autonomous emergency braking and adaptive cruise control. These ADAS features are well-calibrated to suit Indian driving conditions and function in a non-intrusive manner, making highway drives more convenient and safer.

Amaze’s 1.2-litre 4-cylinder petrol engine is carried over from the previous-gen model and, hence, remains very similar in its characteristics. It is an enjoyable unit with a strong mid-range and a free-revving nature. But performance at the lower end of the rev range feels weak, especially below 2,000rpm. Its continuously variable transmission (CVT) keeps the engine spinning optimally, thus extracting the best out of this unit. And in the absence of fixed gears, this belt-pulley automatic works seamlessly. However, enthusiastic user input results in a noticeable rubber-band effect, where the revs increase without a corresponding effect on vehicle speed; this makes an already buzzy engine sound even harsher. Honda’s free-revving mill can get quite vocal when spun faster. The new Dzire switches to Maruti’s latest 1.2-litre Z12E petrol engine that has one less cylinder. And, at 82hp, makes 8hp less than the Amaze as well as its own previous-generation model. However, as we’ve seen with the Swift, where it debuted, this three-cylinder unit’s clear focus on low-end torque aids drivability, as does its crisp throttle response. 5-speed AMT is a sore point for the Dzire's driving experience These make the Dzire feel rather effortless within urban confines. But the 5-speed automated manual transmission (AMT) is the weakest link in this package. Yes, it provides the convenience of clutch-free driving, and even though it can be categorised as fine by AMT standards, you will feel a prominent lag between gear shifts; it is nowhere near as smooth or seamless as the Amaze’s CVT. Maruti’s three-cylinder unit is surprisingly refined and drivable. In our performance tests, the Amaze accelerates from 0-100kph in 13.12 seconds, 2.09 seconds quicker than the Dzire AMT. Interestingly, their rolling acceleration times from 20-80kph and 40-100kph are very similar. Pedal to the metal, the Honda CVT tops out at 148kph, whereas the Dzire AMT hits a higher top speed of 170kph.

Honda claims an ARAI-rated efficiency of 19.46kpl for the Amaze CVT, whereas Maruti claims a staggering 25.71kpl for the Dzire AMT. Although nowhere as close, in our real-world tests, the Amaze CVT and Dzire AMT averaged 13.28kpl and 15.41kpl, respectively. The Amaze CVT achieved 16.62kpl on the highway and 9.94kpl in the city, whereas the Dzire returned a higher 19.22kpl and 11.61kpl, respectively. Notably, neither car gets an Eco mode; the Dzire has an automatic engine stop-start feature to check fuel consumption while idling. However, in extreme 45-degree heat, this feature struggled due to the air conditioning’s higher fan speed requirements to maintain the preset 22 degrees Celsius cabin temperature in full-auto mode. In contrast, the Amaze maintained cabin temperature effectively with a lower fan speed. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire ride and handling The Amaze's steering is more responsive, but the Dzire wins on the low-speed ride front. A comfort-oriented setup makes the Amaze soak up the bumps and road imperfections rather competently, but the sharper potholes come through with a prominent ‘thwack’ from the suspension. At highway speeds, it tends to bounce on its soft springs, resulting in a fair bit of vertical movement over wavy surfaces – not ideal for those prone to road sickness. Dzire's ride is plusher at low speeds The Maruti is the comfier riding car since its low-speed ride is a touch more absorbent, and it does its duties in silence. Sharp movements do come through at highway speeds, so in that sense, its ride can feel busy when you up the pace. However, it recovers much better than the Amaze after a dip, and it doesn’t float as much either. Those who enjoy driving may prefer the Honda’s steering, which feels pointier and more fluid than the Maruti’s, but in terms of steering effort, the Dzire’s lighter unit, with its relatively shorter turning radius, will appeal to most buyers. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire verdict Honda Amaze ZX CVT: 8/10 Maruti Dzire ZXi+ AMT: 8/10 The Honda Amaze petrol-automatic gets the basics right with a far smoother driving experience and better outright performance, which will certainly appeal to self-driven owners. In addition, it is also equipped with segment-first ADAS. However, its powertrain could have done with better refinement, its front seats should have been more supportive, and its highway ride comes across as a bit bouncy. The Maruti Dzire isn’t perfect, and the jerky AMT gearbox is a letdown, but if you can look past this, it feels larger and more expensive on the inside, and its seats are comfier, too. The ride is plusher, the engine more refined, and it has a more desirable kit, including a sunroof and a 360-degree camera. Building the case further is the better fuel efficiency and a substantial Rs 1 lakh lower sticker price. All in all, then, the Dzire is the better all-rounder, ensuring it emerges the winner in this battle. Also see: Maruti Dzire vs Honda Amaze: Which is the new compact sedan for you?

    "description": "The Maruti Suzuki Wagon R has maintained its position as India's bestselling car for four consecutive years. This impressive feat comes alongside Maruti Suzuki's best-ever overall sales performance in a fiscal year. Maruti Suzuki sold 1.98 lakh units of the Wagon R in FY2025 The Wagon R narrowly beat the Tata Punch's sales during the same period Urban areas constitute 51.8 percent of Wagon R sales; rural areas comprise 48.2 percent Maruti Wagon R sales in FY2025 1,98,451 units sold During FY2025 (April 2024 to March 2025), Maruti Suzuki recorded over 1.98 lakh Wagon R units sold. While the Wagon R's FY2025 sales did fall short of its FY2024 and FY2023 numbers, the hatchback remains India's bestselling car for the fourth year in a row. Here’s a breakdown of the current-gen Wagon R’s sales since its launch in January 2019: Maruti Wagon R sales since 2019Fiscal yearUnits soldFY201941,873FY20201,56,724FY20211,60,330FY20221,88,837FY20232,12,340FY20242,00,177FY20251,98,451 Following the recent results, the lifetime sales tally for the Wagon R stands at more than 33.73 lakh units. Maruti Suzuki also revealed that 25 percent of Wagon R customers choose to buy the hatchback again when looking for a new car. Maruti Wagon R outsells Tata Punch The Wagon R narrowly edged out the Tata Punch, which sold over 1.96 lakh units in FY2025. Interestingly, the Punch dethroned the Wagon R in calendar year 2024 (January 2024 to December 2024) with over 2.02 lakh units sold, while the Maruti hatchback sold just under 1.91 lakh units during the same period.

Maruti Suzuki FY2025 financial performance Compact models experienced sales downturn in FY2025 While the Wagon R enjoyed hefty success by itself, sales for Maruti Suzuki’s compact offerings, like the Swift, Dzire, Baleno, etc, overall declined by 7.58 percent year-on-year. The company recorded more than 8.96 lakh compact car sales in FY2025, down from 9.70 lakh units in FY2024. Maruti Suzuki’s total domestic sales for FY2025 stood at 17.61 lakh units, reflecting marginal growth of 0.05 percent compared to FY2024. Some of the key drivers of this growth were a 10 percent increase in rural sales and a 3.5 percent boost in rural market share, thanks to Maruti Suzuki’s expansion of its dealership network to over 150 upcountry markets. Wagon R sales in rural areas nearly matched urban markets Wagon R sales were almost evenly split between urban and rural areas, with urban sales accounting for 51.8 percent and rural sales contributing 48.2 percent. It's worth noting, though, that a significant portion of the Wagon R's urban sales comes from the fleet segment.

    "description": "The Indian passenger vehicle market saw a new record high of 4.34-million-unit wholesales in the fiscal year 2025, up from up from 4.23 million units in FY24. However, growth momentum is slowing, with the growth rate dropping to the low single digits—the lowest in four years—due to rising inventory levels and increasing discounts. The passenger car industry grew by just 2.6 percent in FY25, following growth rates of 13 percent, 27 percent, and 8.7 percent in FY22, FY23, and FY24, respectively, albeit on a lower base. FY25 marks the fourth consecutive year of YoY growth for the industry. Let’s take a closer look at how the major mass-market manufacturers fared across the last financial year. Maruti Suzuki YoY sales grew by just 0.05 percent The Wagon R was the brand's and India's best-selling model in FY2025. The good news for Maruti Suzuki in FY2025 is that the 17,60,767 vehicles sold are its best-ever fiscal year sales. The not-so-good news is that this number makes for flat sales of 0.05 percent – just an additional 886 units more than the 17,59,881 units sold in FY2024. On the export front, Maruti Suzuki has had a record fiscal – the 332,585 passenger vehicles exported in FY2025 are an 18 percent YoY increase (FY2024: 280,712 units). This also ensured the company retains the No. 1 passenger vehicle exporter title for the fourth fiscal in a row. The Wagon R was the brand's best seller in FY2025, and India's best selling car for four years in a row.  Hyundai Motor India YoY sales down by 3 percent The Creta made up nearly a third of Hyundai's total sales in FY2025 Hyundai Motor India, the second-ranked passenger vehicle manufacturer after Maruti Suzuki in volumes, has reported sales of 598,666 cars and SUVs in FY2025, down 3 percent year on year (FY2024: 614,717 units). SUVs continue to be key growth drivers for Hyundai. It is estimated that the Creta and the Creta Electric together have sold a total of 194,871 units in FY2025, making up almost a third of Hyundai’s total sales. This also marks strong 20 percent YoY growth for the Creta nameplate (FY2024: 162,773 units). Tata Motors YoY sales down by 3 percent The Punch was Tata's best seller in FY2025. Tata Motors has reported total wholesales of 553,585 passenger vehicles in FY2025, down 3 percent on its record FY2024 sales. This also means Tata Motors narrowly missed out on the second spot to Hyundai. For Tata Motors, the difference between its FY2025 and FY2024 performance is that its overall passenger vehicle wholesales have been dragged down by the marked 13 percent decline in demand for its EVs, which have been impacted by the increased competition. Tata Motors’ cumulative EV wholesales stood at 64,276 units. The company, however, has done well on the CNG front – it was the No 2 after Maruti Suzuki for most of FY2025 in CNG-powered car and SUV sales. The Punch – available with petrol, CNG and electric powertrains – was the brand's best seller in FY2025.  Mahindra and Mahindra YoY sales grew by 20 percent   The Scorpio twins were the main growth driver's for Mahindra. Mahindra has clocked its best-ever domestic sales of 5,51,487 units in FY2025. A robust 20 percent YoY growth is a result of the sustained and strong demand for most of its SUVs. While the Scorpio twins, XUV 3XO, XUV700 and Bolero are the main growth drivers, the five-door Thar Roxx has revved up volumes even as the two new born-electric BE 6 and XEV 9e have recently joined the party. The hard-charging Mahindra is just 2,098 units behind Tata Motors in FY2025. FY2025 saw four months of over 50,000 SUV wholesales, including best-ever monthly sales of 54,504 units in the festive month of October 2024. Toyota Kirloskar Motors YoY sales up by 26 percent The Innova has consistently been Toyota's best seller in India, and so was in FY2025 as well. Toyota has clocked its best-ever fiscal year sales and surpassed the 300,000 units milestone for the first time in the domestic market, riding on strong demand for its MPVs and SUVs as well as its quartet of rebadged models. Toyota’s wholesales of an estimated 309,334 passenger vehicles in FY2025 constitute robust 26 percent year-on-year growth (FY2024: 245,676 units). The Innova MPV twins – Crysta and Hycross – continue to be the biggest contributors to Toyota’s sales. Its second best-selling model is the Urban Cruiser Hyryder (55,102 units), followed by the Glanza in third position (45,338 units). The Fortuner SUV with over 29,393 units is ranked fourth. Kia India YoY sales up by 4 percent The newly Syros gave a considerable impetus to Kia's sales in the fourth quarter of FY2025 Kia India has ended FY2025 with total wholesales of 255,207 vehicles, which translates into a 4 percent growth year on year (FY2024: 245,634 units).  The FY2025-ending month of March 2025 was its best with 25,525 units. With the launch of the Syros compact SUV in early 2025, Kia India sees a surge in sales in the fourth quarter. The Sonet, which has outsold the Seltos for 15 straight months, is the new best-seller for the company, with an estimated total of 99,757 units. That’s 39 percent of Kia’s total wholesales in FY2025. Seltos’ sales of 72,729 units are down sharply by 27 percent YoY, while the Carens MPV took third spot on the product sales chart with wholesales of 64,712 units. Honda Cars India YoY sales up by 1.6 percent   Honda's growth was primarily driven by exports of the Elevate SUV. Honda reported cumulative sales of 1,26,151 units in FY2025 – up from 1,24,173 units in FY2024 – thereby recording a 1.6 percent year-on-year growth. While domestic sales reached 65,925 units (down by almost 24 percent year-on-year), exports climbed to 60,226 units, marking a 60 percent growth and the highest export volume in the company's history. It was primarily the Elevate SUV driving export volumes for the brand, while the new, third-gen Amaze launched late last year has also contributed reasonably to domestic volumes.
