    "description": "This 1952 Allard J2X is one of approximately 80 examples produced and was sold new in the US market before spending time early in its life under the ownership of Los Angeles radio host Joe Pyne. By the early 1960s chassis 3037 had joined the collection of a California citrus farmer who kept it stored in a shed on his orchard in the Sierra Nevada foothills for several years before giving the car to his son in the 1990s. The car was then sent to The Vintage Connection in Oklahoma City for a refurbishment that was performed between 1996 and 1998 and included the installation of a 331ci Cadillac V8 that was reportedly fitted with 390 cylinder heads along with quadruple two-barrel Holley carburetors and an updated lubrication system. After debuting at a Fabulous Fifties Association gala the Bothwell Ranch orchard in Southern California, the car was purchased from the orchard owner's son in 2011 by its current owner, who drove it in the 2016 California Mille. Finished in red over black upholstery, the car also features a Borg-Warner Super T-10 four-speed manual transmission, a limited-slip differential, alloy drum brakes with dual master cylinders, a De Dion rear axle, a front swing axle with forward-facing radius rods, chrome 16” wire wheels, dual side-mount spares, a custom brass radiator with an electric cooling fan, a 15-gallon fuel cell, and a machine-turned dash. This Allard J2X is now offered on dealer consignment with transferable New York registration.",

    "description": "French firm’s new, comfort-first family hatchback has echoes of a 1970s great The funky-looking Citroën C4 has been one of the French brand’s best-sellers in the UK since its third generation arrived in 2021. A big departure in terms of design and quality from the car it replaced, the third C4 was claimed to pick up on Citroën's long tradition of innovation in the hatchback segment.But is it really that innovative? You’ll need a pretty long memory to recall a genuinely groundbreaking Citroën family hatchback. It’s more than 50 years since the critically acclaimed GS won European Car of the Year in 1971, a gong that Citroën has won only twice since. The BX, ZX and Xsara that came later had plenty of fans throughout the following decades, but it’s definitely the aura of the GS that Citroën is now referencing with a new C4 that puts comfort and efficiency first.This is a car that has been inspired by its customers, says Citroën. An amalgam of typical hatchback and compact SUV design, it’s claimed to have a bold, high-rising but tapering outline, a roomy, versatile and relaxing interior and plenty of options for individual customer configurability.Now, four years after its launch, the C4 has been given a facelift to bring it up to date with a swath of new and updated rivals in the bulging C-segment.While most of the time spent was on updating its interior and giving it a fresh look, underneath Citroën has fettled the C4’s offerings, ditching its diesel and entry-level petrol powertrains along with the option of a manual gearbox. Left are the two hybrid options and a single pure-petrol powertrain, which can each be paired with three trim levels.",

    "description": "A coupé-SUV reworking of the Torres is the ex-Ssangyong brand's first car developed under new ownership At first glance, it would be easy to dismiss the new KGM Actyon as a sleeker coupé version of the distinctive Torres SUV, which was launched last year. And there’s some truth to that: the models are close in size and share a platform, powertrain and plenty of key design elements. But bosses from KG Mobility’s UK importer insist that their newest arrival is far more significant. To understand why, you need a brief history of the car firm originally known as Dong-A Motor but best remembered in the UK as Ssangyong. Since the Korean conglomerate that gave the firm that moniker sold off a controlling stake in 1997, the brand has been variously controlled by Daewoo, SAIC and Mahindra and has always struggled from a lack of investment and consistency.The KG Group – a large Korean chaebol with significant interests in steel and chemical production – bought Ssangyong Motors in mid-2022 and promptly rebranded it as KG Mobility. That happened shortly after the Torres had been launched in South Korea – nearly two years before it reached the UK. KGM hasn’t just been renamed since then: its new owner has invested significantly in it, giving it vital resources to fully develop a new line of models.So much has changed in the two years since the Torres was first launched and, KGM says, much of that is reflected in what are claimed to be significant under-the-skin differences between that model and the new Actyon. With those changes, KGM reckons it might have a car capable of serving as a credible alternative to the Kia Sportage in the lucrative C-segment SUV market and one able to win over new customers to the brand – especially at its competitive price of £36,996.So can the Actyon live up to that billing or will a first outing on UK roads confirm that the new model is merely a Torres with a sleeker roofline?",

    "description": "When it comes to Harley-Davidson design, the 1971 FX Super Glide is one of those bikes that people either love, or love to hate. It was Harley’s first attempt at a factory custom, mixing the sporty vibe of the XL series with the heavyweight punch of the FL models. But what really stole the show—for better or worse—was the boat tail seat. Bold, brash, and undeniably 1970s, it’s a design that’s as polarizing today as it was back then. From the Mind of Willie G. The idea for the FX Super Glide emerged during a transitional period for Harley-Davidson. The 1960s had been tough for the company, with increasing competition from British and Japanese manufacturers. Willie G. Davidson, grandson of one of the company’s founders, sought to reinvigorate the brand with a bike that appealed to the burgeoning custom culture.…",

    "description": "Harley-Davidson may have dropped the Evo Sportster from its range, but that doesn’t mean it’s going away any time soon. The ‘old’ Sporty remains one of the most versatile platforms that the Motor Co. has ever built—as evidenced by the myriad ways in which it’s been customized over the years. This custom Sportster from Taiwan’s 2LOUD Custom proves our point stylishly. It started life as a 2013-model Harley Sportster Seventy-Two—a mild take on classic Frisco-style choppers that came from the factory with a peanut tank and mini-ape bars. But 2LOUD’s Ma ‘Max’ Yicheng has skillfully transformed it into a laid-back street tracker. The commission came from a client who had inherited the Sportster after his father passed away. As a professional car customizer, he wanted the Seventy-Two transformed into a custom machine that he could hold onto forever.…",

    "description": "It has been a few months since you last read a Himalayan report, and I must take some of the blame. Between a prolonged period of illness and some intense travel, the bike hasn’t received the attention it should have. On top of this, it ended up being with RE for a couple of months when I sent it in to address some issues, and I didn’t push for it to be returned sooner. TFT is easy to read and legible even under harsh sunlight. The first of those issues was that the usually fiddly toggle switch for the display stopped working entirely and had to be replaced. I also wanted the company to permanently address the problem with the bike pulling to the right when the handlebar was released – something I’ve written about in the previous report. As I understand it, the second issue had something to do with rectifying various torque settings on bolts that connect the engine to the frame. The bike returned with working switchgear and the right-leaning problem almost entirely sorted out – it’s still marginally noticeable but no longer to a troubling extent. Switching modes on the Himalayan can be a task, given how often it’s denied. As soon as the Himalayan was back, I realised why I enjoyed it so much in the first place. Its big size, incredible suspension, and fantastic overall comfort are a class apart. But since this bike deserved some good running after such a long downtime, I gave it to Gavin for his ride down to IBW, and what you’ll read from hereon is his account. Our Himalayan is equipped with the optional touring seat, which was a boon on my nearly 1,200km ride to Goa and back. It was firm yet supportive and kept saddle soreness at bay for the majority of my journey. Thanks to its abundant mounting points, strapping a tail bag on is a piece of cake. A little more wind protection would have been nice, though. The carrier and grab rail make for perfect mounting points for all your luggage. My issues with the Himalayan are mostly nothing new. Despite being replaced, the switchgear is sometimes unresponsive. While this motor performs well, the high-speed vibrations can render your palms numb on long rides. The one quality issue is that the right mirror keeps coming loose, and its threads have now been damaged, meaning a new one will have to be purchased. Finally, the headlight offers adequate illumination, but most owners are better off getting auxiliary lights. The right mirror keeps coming loose, and the threading is now damaged.   Despite these shortcomings, the Himalayan is an excellent motorcycle with a handful of minor gripes. While I was fortunate not to have any punctures, the fear of one always looms over me. Thankfully, we will soon be getting a set of tubeless wheels installed. Before we end, our bike has developed the typical Himalayan loose steering cone set, and that’s something we’ll address in the next report.

    "description": "Few cars boast brand equity as strong as the Hyundai Creta. This formidable midsize SUV has long dominated its segment, thanks to its well-rounded packaging, feature-rich appeal and diverse powertrain options. Now, Hyundai has taken the winning Creta formula and electrified it, giving rise to the Creta Electric. The big question is if this battery-powered version can replicate the success of its internal combustion engine (ICE) counterpart. The Creta Electric is built on the ICE platform, but it has undergone significant reworking to accommodate its electric powertrain. The cabin floor sits slightly higher to make room for the battery pack, the suspension has been stiffened to handle the additional weight, and the front wheels are powered by an electric motor. Despite these changes, the Creta Electric retains the dimensions of its ICE sibling, including an impressive 200mm (unladen) ground clearance. An \"electric\" badge on the bootlid and pixelated accents on the bumper set this version apart from its ICE counterpart.   Hyundai Creta Electric exterior In terms of design, the Creta Electric takes inspiration from the Creta N Line, particularly at the front. The enclosed grille, featuring a pixelated theme reminiscent of the Ioniq 5, incorporates a centrally placed charging port. This pixelated motif extends to the closed front air dam, which includes active flaps to enhance aerodynamic efficiency. The 17-inch aero-style alloy wheels further emphasise its EV identity, and they come wrapped in lowrolling resistance, EV-specific tyres. Adding to its aesthetic appeal are silver highlights on the lower edges of the black plastic cladding, creating a striking contrast. Our dual-tone test unit featured black pillars, a black roof, and a black rear spoiler for added flair. Unique identifiers, such as an \"electric\" badge on the bootlid and pixelated accents on the rear bumper, set this version apart from its ICE counterpart. The sight of its battery pack beneath its body looks a bit ungainly, especially when viewed from the sides. Flaps on the front air dam automatically open and close to improve aerodynamic efficiency.   Hyundai Creta Electric interior Step into the Creta Electric’s cabin, and you’ll immediately notice its resemblance to the ICE version. However, several EV-specific upgrades make it distinct. A notable addition is the all-new three-spoke steering wheel with a circular horn boss, adorned with four dots symbolising the letter ‘H’ in Morse code. Interestingly, the steering buttons have been rearranged – the infotainment and phone controls are now on the right, while ADAS functions are on the left. New three-spoke steering wheel with a circular horn boss; four dots symbolise the letter ‘H’ in Morse code. The familiar 10.25-inch instrument cluster now features an additional cube-like theme, akin to the Ioniq 5. The air conditioning console – borrowed from the updated Alcazar – combines infotainment shortcuts with touch-sensitive keys, although practical physical toggles for temperature and a volume knob remain. A standout addition is the steering column-mounted drive selector, reminiscent of the Ioniq 5. This design frees up the centre console, which now adopts a floating style. It houses a drive mode button, an electric parking brake, an auto-hold button, ventilated front seat controls, and dual cupholders. Impressively, there’s a lower deck area beneath it which houses a fair bit of storage space. Even the armrest console is huge, and like the glovebox, it features a cooling vent to keep beverages cool. Lower deck area beneath the centre console houses a fair bit of storage space. In line with Hyundai’s sustainable focus, the seats are upholstered in eco-friendly materials derived from corn extracts and recycled plastic bottles. Surprisingly, the texture is smooth and closely resembles the leatherette used in the ICE model. The slightly higher floor impacts the driving position, which feels elevated even at its lowest setting. While rear seat space remains unchanged and is comfortable, the seating postureis slightly knees-up. A new boss-function allows rear passengers to electronically slide the front passenger seat forward, enhancing legroom. Utility trays on the front seatbacks include grooves for mobile devices and integrated pop-open cupholders for added convenience. You're seated in a slightly knees-up position, although it isn't uncomfortable. Additionally, the Creta Electric features a V2L (Vehicle-to-Load) system with a 3-pin power socket, enabling users to power devices like laptops or small appliances. Storage capacity remains practical with the unchanged 433-litre boot, complete with a spare tire under the boot floor. A 22-litre frunk provides extra loading space beneath the bonnet. 433-litre boot remains just as practical as the ICE version; gets a spare tyre beneath the floor, too.   Hyundai Creta Electric features Besides carrying forward the ICE version’s feature-set, the Electric gets some new equipment too, like rain-sensing wipers, electric front seats with driver’s seat memory, a cooling central console, boss seat function as well as front seatback-mounted utility trays. It carries forward the Autonomous Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) suite, which, like in the standard Creta, adds a safety net without feeling too intrusive in its function. Familiar 10.25-inch instrument cluster gets new cube-like display theme. Hyundai has invested heavily in developing an in-car payments option, which, with a mere touch, facilitates a wallet-based payment for vehicle charging, as well as future subscription-based features. In addition, the company has developed a first-of-its-kind mobile application through which users can not only identify and navigate to over 10,000 EV chargers across different brands but also make payments via the app to certain service providers. This eliminates the hassle of downloading and registering on multiple brand-specific applications. We’re still sore that like the standard Creta, it misses out on things like wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, adjustable front armrest, a headrest for the middle rear passenger, and the volume of its 8-speaker Bose setup is much lower at the rear than in the front. Also, compared to the large screens of its competitors, the Creta Electric’s 10.25-inch touchscreen comes across as a bit small. A new boss-function allows rear passengers to electronically slide the front passenger seat forward, enhancing legroom.   Hyundai Creta Electric performance The Creta Electric is offered with two battery options: a 42kWh pack and a 51.4kWh Long Range pack. Both utilise Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) cell chemistry, similar to the Ioniq 5. This type of battery is more compact and energy-dense than Lithium Ferrous Phosphate (LFP) batteries, although LFP batteries are known for their longer lifespan. For added peace of mind, Hyundai offers an 8-year/1,60,000km warranty on the battery, alongside the standard 3-year warranty on the car. The sight of its battery pack from the side looks a bit ungainly. Powering the Creta Electric is a single motor on the front axle that drives the front wheels. In the Long Range variant, this motor produces 171hp and 255Nm. Interestingly, its torque matches the diesel variant's 250Nm and is close to the turbo-petrol's 260Nm. However, being an EV, the power delivery is strong yet exceptionally linear. Acceleration feels brisk and effortless, even in its most efficient ‘Eco’ mode. The three drive modes – Eco, Normal and Sports – deliver noticeably different responses to part-throttle inputs, while flooring the accelerator unleashes the motor’s full potential. A synthesised bassy hum under hard acceleration adds a touch of drama to the otherwise silent drive. In our tests, the Creta Electric managed a 0-100kph time of 8.2 seconds, slightly behind the claimed 7.9 seconds. Flat out, it can achieve a top speed of 180kph. Acceleration feels brisk and effortless, but real-world range of over 400km impresses. The Creta gets a total of five regenerative braking options, with Level 1, 2 and 3 adjusting deceleration and bringing the car to a crawl.While these modes are mild, Levels 4 and 5 are strong. Drivers can also disable regenerative braking entirely for a free-rolling experience or opt for the ‘i-Pedal’ mode, which allows one-pedal driving by bringing the car to a complete stop without using the brake pedal. Each mode feels distinct and natural, making them intuitive to use. Adaptive cruise control integrates seamlessly with the regen system, adjusting braking automatically based on the situation, though drivers can override this using steering-mounted paddle shifters. Hyundai Creta Electric range and charging The 42kWh battery variant has an ARAI-certified range of 390km, while the 51.4kWh Long Range version offers 473km. In a mixed driving cycle of city and highway conditions, our preliminary test of the Long Range variant returned an impressive real-world range of approximately 426km. For reference, our 289.6km drive at an average speed of 41kph toggling through different drive and regenerative braking settings, utilised 68 percent of the charge. Charging port behind the enclosed front grille gets an LED indicator. Hyundai claims the battery can be charged from 10 to 80 percent in just 58 minutes using a 50kW DC fast charger. With a 11kW AC charger, the larger battery charges fully (10 to 100 percent) in 4 hours and 50 minutes, while the smaller battery completes this in 4 hours. Hyundai Creta Electric ride and handling To support the additional weight of the battery and motor, the Creta Electric’s suspension is stiffer than the ICE version’s. Remarkably, it doesn’t translate into a crashy or uncomfortable ride experience. Yes, you can feel its firmness at low speeds, and you’ll also hear its suspension ‘thwack’ over sharp bumps (particularly due to an otherwise silent cabin), but road shocks are still well in check. What’s nice is that the stiffness has eliminated unnecessary (secondary) body movements, and even at highway speeds, the Creta Electric doesn’t lose its poise. The steering, too, is noticeably heavier than the ICE version’s, and as a result, it warrants more effort at slow and parking speeds. But at no point does it feel excessive or cumbersome. And while it hasn’t resulted in more feel or feedback per se, the added weight only adds to the driver’s confidence, especially at high speeds or around a series of bends. Also nice is that the Creta Electric changes directions well, and with its weight being concentrated lower down, body roll seems to be far better controlled than the petrol-version. Notably, the Electric’s braking is so good, the transition from regenerative to frictional brakes feels extremely smooth and superbly calibrated, thus lending to a very natural brake pedal feel. Hyundai Creta Electric verdict The Creta Electric has its flaws – the ride is stiffer than the ICE version’s; the steering is a bit weighty; and finally, its floor is a bit raised, which results in a slightly knees-up position. But none of these are a dealbreaker. A standout addition is the steering column-mounted drive selector, akin to the Ioniq 5. The Electric version still retains the ICE’s brilliant packaging like its spacious cabin, ample practicality, and a decently sized boot – it gets a frontal loading area (frunk), too. Performance is smooth, linear and reasonably quick. But what’s even more impressive is its real-world range of over 400km, with reasonable charging times. And even though its suspension is firmer than the ICE Creta’s, it gets a newfound confidence in the ride and handling department. Typical to the Creta’s proposition, this electric iteration is feature-rich, too. At a price ranging between Rs 18 lakh and Rs 23.50 lakh, the Creta Electric comes across as a fantastic EV. Will it replicate the ICE's success? If first impressions are anything to go by, the Creta Electric seems to have what it takes to dominate the EV space.

Sure, a car’s design, or its smell, or its sound can be part of that attraction, but a bigger part lies within something more abstract. If there was ever anyone who could relate to such an emotion, it would be Rob Simon. His steed of choice has been, and always will be, the legendary BMW E30 M3. In the automotive space, the legendary Bavarian warrior needs no introduction or backstory. It has long been heralded as one of the most exceptional machines ever sculpted by mankind, offering a pure driving experience unmarred by unnecessary aids or features. Despite a near-death experience in his red E30 M3, Rob always lusted for another one. It wasn’t just the behind-the-wheel time he longed for but the deeper, unspoken connection it wove between him, his father, and his brother, all of which had E30 M30s of their own. That chance would thankfully arise once more, but not in the way he would expect. Tune in to the Petrolicious YouTube channel and relive Rob Simon’s BMW E30 M3 tale alongside us. Maybe bring some tissues along for the ride, too. Continue...",

    "description": "After a long gap, Tata Motors will re-enter the four-wheel drive SUV market with the Harrier EV, which the brand showcased at the Auto Expo 2025. Speaking to Autocar India, Vivek Srivatsa, chief commercial officer of Tata Passenger Electric Mobility, said, “It's a good time for us to do this [4WD]. For the longest time, we've been saying there's no business case, but we've seen consumers going towards heart buys again.” The Harrier EV will have a rear-biased all-wheel drive system It will have a torque output of up to 500Nm While this is true, the reason for the Harrier AWD introduction is also because, with an electric drivetrain, Tata Motors can easily introduce four-wheel drive into the Harrier platform. The ICE Harrier uses a Land Rover-derived platform and a Fiat-sourced diesel engine. Packaging an all-wheel drive system within this setup would have required significant re-engineering and, thus, cost, especially for putting in a rear drive shaft. With EVs, adding a rear motor is much simpler. “It also allows us to showcase the tech possible with EVs. With electric motors, you can do a lot more, especially for performance,” says Srivatsa. This is also why the brand chose to electrify and introduce AWD on the Harrier instead of the Safari. However, he adds, “For now, we can't speak about that, but a Safari electric can happen if it's required.” Importantly, Srivatsa sees the Harrier EV as a single car in the family, as the limited-range EVs available so far in the market have mostly been used as second cars. However, Srivatsa says the Harrier EV will deliver over 500km of real-world range under Tata Motors’ own range test cycle. The brand calls it the C75 cycle, which is said to be a near-real-world driving range, and 75 percent of owners can expect to achieve this. Tata Motors has confirmed that the Harrier EV will be launched in the first half of 2025.

    "description": "The KTM 390 Enduro R is a dual-sport motorcycle recently showcased at the 2024 edition of EICMA. KTM did not disclose any specifications for the 390 Enduro R then and has now revealed them on its official website.  KTM 390 Enduro R has the same engine as the 390 Duke The bike features a 4.2-inch TFT display, two riding modes It has a 9-litre fuel tank and weighs 159kg, 6kg less than the Duke The 390 Enduro R is the latest addition to KTM’s already established 125 Enduro R and 690 Enduro R. For starters, it gets KTM’s LC4c engine with a capacity of 399cc – same as the 390 Duke, which delivers 44.2hp overseas, a little lower than the India-spec 390 Duke's 46hp. It is likely that when the 390 Enduro R comes here, it will make the full 46hp. The torque remains unchanged at 39Nm. This engine is nestled within a trademark KTM steel-trellis frame. For braking duties, there’s a small 285mm front disc mated to an axial caliper, a 240mm rear disc and switchable dual-channel ABS.  In typical Enduro fashion, the 390 Enduro R has a 21-inch front and 18-inch rear wheel setup. The USD fork and monoshock have 230mm of travel, and the bike has a massive 272mm ground clearance. It is a slender machine with minimal bodywork and a small 9-litre fuel tank, tipping the scales at 159kg without fuel; it is 6 kilos lighter than the Duke. While its appearance is minimalistic, the 390 Enduro R is a decently feature-rich bike for the class. It has a 4.2-inch TFT display and two riding modes, Street and Offroad. Additionally, the TFT dash is capable of accessing music, incoming calls and turn-by-turn navigation.   The Enduro R is launching in the coming weeks, as is the 390 Adventure S. KTM also recently revealed more details of the 390 SMC R on its website, and we expect its launch here in the second half of this year. The 390 Adventure S will come with bigger 21-inch/18-inch spoked wheels, while the SMC R will roll on 17-inch wheels at both ends.  Also see: KTM 390 SMC R spotted testing, launch expected",
