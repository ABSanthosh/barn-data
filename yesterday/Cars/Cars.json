    "description": "This 1954 Arnolt-Bristol Bolide is the first of 142 examples built and was sent to Bertone in Turin, Italy, in late 1953 for the construction of its Franco Scaglione-styled bodywork before returning to England for completion. Chassis 3000 arrived in New York in February 1954 and was delivered the following month to Ohio-based Columbus Sports Cars, whose proprietor subsequently raced the car at several Midwest tracks. Later in the decade, it was purchased in Cincinnati by an Indiana owner who made several modifications while campaigning it in various races including relocation of the headlights, a color change, and the replacement of its Bristol engine with a Chevrolet V8. After receiving another color change under subsequent ownership in the mid-1960s, the car passed through several owners and fell to disuse. It was purchased out of a Joliet, Illinois, shed in a disassembled state in 1992 by an owner who embarked on a multiyear refurbishment that was completed in 2013. Work during the project included a repaint in the original shade of red after repairs to the body, a re-trim of the interior in tan leather, and the overhaul and installation of a replacement 1,971cc Bristol OHV inline-six. The car then changed hands in the mid-2010s and spent seven years with its previous owner before being purchased by the selling dealer in February 2025. Additional features include triple Solex carburetors, a replacement four-speed manual transmission with a remote shift assembly, hydraulic drum brakes, Koni shock absorbers, silver-painted 16” wheels, and a beige convertible top. This Arnolt-Bristol Bolide is now offered in Costa Mesa, California, with hand-written notes and other documentation from the refurbishment and a clean Nevada title.",

    "description": "This 2019 Porsche 911 GT3 RS was optioned with the Weissach Package, which reduces weight by utilizing a carbon-composite roof panel, front lid, anti-roll bars, and interior trim, and it was initially delivered to Porsche West Broward in Davie, Florida. Now indicating 12k miles, the car is finished in Chalk over black leather and Alcantara with GT Silver stitching. Power is provided by a 4.0-liter flat-six paired with a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transaxle, and features include the Chrono Package, an extended-range fuel tank, a front-axle lift system, LED headlights, a rear wing, a back-up camera, satin black 20\" center-lock alloy wheels, Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, four-way-adjustable sport seats, Racing Yellow seat belts, and Porsche Communication Management (PCM) with navigation. The car was purchased by the seller in 2021, and it has been modified with a harness bar, Schroth Racing harnesses, Dundon Motorsports tuned-length exhaust headers with integrated catalysts, and a valved side-outlet-delete exhaust system. This 991.2 GT3 RS Weissach is offered with a window sticker, factory literature, service records, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean Minnesota title in the seller's name.",

    "description": "After a memorably painful rib injury at the BMW GS Trophy in Namibia last year, I decided that I needed the most comprehensive protection I could get for off-road riding. My particular focus was to find something that shielded the ribs along the sides, where neither back nor chest protectors can do much good. That search led me to this product. The immediate worry from looking at the images was that this comprehensive CE Level 2 protection was going to be heavy, bulky and a pain to wear. All those concerns turned out to be unwarranted, and we’ll address them in the above-mentioned order. While the A-10 comes with hard-plastic outer armour for the chest, back and shoulders, this material is remarkably light. Generous padding ensures that you not only don’t feel the weight but also that there are no hard edges or pressure points against the body. The armour has multiple hexagonal shapes, which increases its strength, and that brings us to the second concern of bulk. Visually, it is nowhere close to as slim and streamlined as some other products, especially those that use soft armour, but that is the price to pay for the extra protection here. However, it never gets in the way or feels bulky on the body, and the impressive fit and comfort make up for this. Getting it on and off is super easy, definitely more so than my previous armoured vest. Simply slip it over your head, fasten the rib protectors in place with the two snap-fit clasps, and then use the very convenient hook-type closures to secure the shoulder protectors down onto the biceps. The A-10 V2 is easy to get on and off. Most of the straps are adjustable, and the shoulder protectors can be removed entirely if you want to just run this as a roost guard/back protector. This is one of the top options from Alpinestars for upper body armour, and it doesn’t come cheap. But having dealt with over a month of pain in the recovery of a very small hairline rib crack, that money seems reasonable in hindsight. But what really comes across as appealing is not just the A-10’s protection but also the amount of thought and design that has gone into making such a high level of protection so comfortable and easy to use.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/business-car-sales/polestar-boss-76-sales-uplift-and-push-more-showrooms",
    "description": "Some 12,000 Polestars were sold in Q1 up from 6975 in the same period of 2024; one in four were sold in the UK There is a “renaissance of retailers” happening in the industry according to the boss of Polestar, who credits the firm’s recent increase in sales with having more physical retailers and people selling its cars. Polestar started as an online-only brand with limited physical presence but CEO Michael Lohscheller, who took the top job last October, is overseeing a roll out of a physical retail network that is doing “active selling”. “Leasing or buying a car is an important decision and you don’t just do it online, or at least not everybody does,\" he told Autocar. \"Some people like it, but others want more advice, to come back, to get quotes and think about things.” Polestar plans to go from nine retailers today to 17 in the next 18 months in the UK. New showrooms in Glasgow, Sheffield and Southampton have opened in the UK in the past year.  Lohscheller said Polestar now had “good retail partners” and its physical presence was further bolstered by its relationship with Volvo carrying out its aftersales.  He said that “personal relationships and a human touch” were still hugely important in the car buying and selling process, and digital channels should offer “support” to the process. Lohscheller was speaking on the day Polestar announced its Q1 sales numbers for 2025, which were a 76% improvement on last year following the launch of the new Polestar 3 and Polestar 4 models which have joined the Polestar 2 in production. A total of 12,304 Polestars were sold in Q1 2025 compared to 6975 in the same period of 2024. Around one in four Polestars globally is sold in the UK, and growth here stood at 185% year-on-year thanks to the new model introductions and an increase in the size of the retail network.  The company is planning growth of around 30-35% per year over the next three years, from a baseline of around 45,000 sales in 2024. The UK-engineered Polestar 5 will launch later this year as another new model line.  Lohscheller’s reaction to the ongoing global tariffs and trade war was to ensure Polestar had localised production wherever possible, with access to Geely and Volvo factories in the US, China, South Korea and Europe. To that end, a “localisation strategy was the best way forward”. An immediate priority was to ready its European-built Polestar 7 compact SUV for production, a model that will likely be Polestar’s biggest-selling model and being made and sold in its best-performing market, Europe. Asked what he thought of tariffs being rolled out across the world, such as the 25% tariffs on cars imported into the USA, Lohscheller said “we have to live with it”. Just complaining about it is not a good solution. While it changes so many times, it's obviously not that easy. It would be better if we have more planning security, also for investments, but we have to live with it.",

    "description": "Audi's class-defining upmarket hatchback gets a fresh look and some new digital technology The Audi A3 was the original upmarket family hatchback and it now has 25 years and several model generations of success behind it. It remains Audi UK's biggest-selling car by some distance, outselling its nearest in-house rival by about a factor of two.So while it's no longer Britain's favourite compact premium operator (take a bow, the Mercedes A-Class), it's still very much the kind of smallish car that's rather a big deal for its maker.Now halfway through its fourth generation, the car has been treated to a mild nip and tuck and an equipment upgrade in a bid to bolster its ability to compete with its key rivals. Just like its Seat Leon, Skoda Octavia and Volkswagen Golf relations, it continues to use an evolution of the Volkswagen Group’s ubiquitous MQB platform, with enhancements to accommodate a wider spread of powertrain options that include mild hybrid, plug-in hybrid and, whisper it, even old-fashioned diesel-engined variants.The A3 remains available as a (curiously popular) compact saloon or, as driven here, in five-door Sportback guise - and while neither has been radically reinvented, a decently extensive package of visual, technological and mechanical revisions make this a tangibly different proposition from the outgoing car, which was itself updated as recently as 2021.Changes to the standard car are particularly subtle – at least until a heavily upgraded plug-in hybrid is added to the ranks in late 2024 – but the hot Audi S3 has been more tangibly overhauled.",

    "description": "The custom motorcycle scene is firmly in its kit-built era. Business savvy workshops have realized that there’s a lot of demand for parts that can transform a bike with minimal fuss. One-off specials will always rule the roost—but not everyone has the skill, time, or funds to build them. For some riders, it makes more sense to take one of the countless modern classics currently on the market, and personalize it with a smorgasbord of tailored parts. If that’s you, the Triumph Scrambler 1200 is one heck of a starting point. This writer has spent considerable time aboard the Scrambler 1200, and can confirm that it is a tour de force—both technically and aesthetically. It looks handsome out the box, its 1,200 cc parallel twin motor is a peach, and its big front wheel and long travel suspension aren’t just for show.…",

    "description": "The fabled Tonti frame has formed the backbone of countless Moto Guzzi motorcycles over the years—but some of them wore it better than others. Classics like the Le Mans, V7 Sport, and 850 T3 California are iconic. The 1985 Moto Guzzi SP3 1000? Not quite. Although the SP3 ticks all the right boxes for a classic Moto Guzzi tourer, it misses the mark, visually. Its jagged bodywork might have been au fait in the 80s, but it’s an aesthetic faux pas by today’s standards. Luckily, Davide Caforio’s vision for the SP3 didn’t include any of its OEM styling—just its Tonti frame and its best bits. Davide runs his workshop, Ruote Fiere Motociclette Speciali, out of Monza, Italy. He has a particular affinity for classic Moto Guzzis, combined with a love for turning them into radical specials.…",

    "description": "Lighter, faster, and meaner – the Maserati GT2 Stradale is the MC20 at its most unhinged. This isn’t just a track-focused special; it’s a full-throttle, no-compromise statement from Maserati. Developed from the GT2 race car but adapted for road use, the Stradale is sharper, more powerful and even more thrilling to drive. The pit lane at Yas Marina hums with quiet anticipation. Parked in front of me, the Maserati GT2 Stradale squats low and wide, every bit the hardcore track weapon it promises to be. Stripped of excess weight and dialled up on downforce with underbody diffusers and a massive rear wing, the GT2 Stradale is primed for battle. So am I. Maserati GT2 Stradale exterior design Optimised for weight saving and downforce One look at the GT2 Stradale, and its intentions are clear. The towering adjustable rear wing alone generates up to 500kg of downforce at speed, keeping the car pinned to the tarmac. Up front, larger air intakes and a reworked splitter ensure maximum cooling and stability. Carbon fibre isn’t just for show – it’s used extensively for weight savings and structural rigidity. Rear wing produces 500kg of downforce.   Maserati GT2 Stradale performance and handling Drop into the tight bucket seat, strap yourself in, and hit the starter button. The Nettuno V6 ignites with a bark – raw, visceral and unfiltered, in a way the standard MC20 never quite was. This is the GT2 Stradale’s truest form, road-legal in the most technical sense but spiritually bound to the circuit. Powered by 640hp, 3.0-litre twin-turbo V6 engine At its core sits Maserati’s spectacular 3.0-litre twin-turbo Nettuno V6, now massaged to 640hp – up from the MC20’s 621hp. And it’s lighter, too. The GT2 Stradale was put on a diet, shedding 59kg to tip the scales at just 1,365kg. The result? A blistering 0-100kph time of 2.8 seconds and a top speed of 324kph. Neatly styled air intakes to cool the Nettuno V6 engine.   Razor-sharp responses and gear shifts Out of the pit lane, I squeeze the throttle, and it’s immediately obvious how hyper-reactive this track-focused Maserati is. Every input is met with an immediate and razor-sharp response, and the 8-speed dual-clutch gearbox rifles through ratios with millisecond precision. Every shift feels instantaneous, and every prod of the throttle pedal is met with a precisely metered surge of power. Braking into Turn 5, the carbon ceramics clamp down with brutal efficiency, hauling the car down from triple-digit speeds in an instant. The front end has the sharp bite of a Rottweiler clinging to the tarmac, beautifully complemented by steering that’s loaded with feedback. Maserati’s engineers have widened the track, stiffened the suspension and fine-tuned the aerodynamics for maximum downforce. The result? A car that feels surgically precise yet alive with every twitch of the wheel. Tight and snug bucket seats are essential for coping with high g-forces. On slower corners, you can provoke the rear into a controlled slide, but it never feels nervous. It’s playful yet poised, letting you dance at the limit without ever making you feel like you’re about to overstep. Nettuno V6 has a raw, mechanical sound Maserati has always been about the soundtrack, and while the GT2 Stradale’s V6 lacks the operatic wail of a naturally aspirated V8, it has a raw, mechanical ferocity that suits its persona. Opt for the titanium exhaust (track use only), and it snarls like a proper race car, spitting and crackling on downshifts. Throttle sensitivity is razor-sharp; though, below 3,000rpm, there’s a hint of turbo lag. But once the boost comes in, acceleration is relentless. It’s not the outright fastest in its class – the Ferrari 296 is quicker – but the GT2 Stradale delivers a deeply immersive experience. Every input is met with an immediate and razor-sharp response. Within a lap, I’m comfortable with this car, which eggs you on to push harder and harder. By the time I roll back into the pits, my pulse is racing, my hands tingling. This isn’t just another track-focused supercar. This is Maserati rediscovering its soul. Some bits of practicality Despite its hardcore underpinnings, the GT2 Stradale hasn’t completely abandoned road manners. A nose-lift system raises the front by 1.4 inches – critical for avoiding the heartbreak of scraping that carbon splitter. There’s even a 100-litre boot, but let’s be honest, practicality isn’t why you buy this car. Maserati GT2 Stradale interior Every detail focused for driving Inside, it’s all business. Alcantara dominates the dashboard to minimise glare, while the carbon-fibre bucket seats are available in two sizes. They grip you tight – brilliant for the track but a reminder that this isn’t a car for long-haul comfort. Shift lights on the steering wheel, a relocated drive-mode selector – every detail is designed for pure driving focus. No skimping in the cockpit, which is covered in Alcantara. Where the GT2 Stradale stands apart is in the design. Maserati has always had a way of making even its most extreme cars look effortlessly elegant. Unlike Ferrari’s aggressive, function-first approach to aero, the Stradale retains a sense of Italian artistry. Maserati GT2 Stradale verdict Not an everyday supercar Scissor doors are an integral part of the GT2 Stradale’s visual drama. The GT2 Stradale is an exquisite blend of race-car aggression and road-going grace. It’s not an everyday supercar – far from it – but for those lucky enough to get behind the wheel, it delivers a raw, unfiltered driving experience few cars can match. Production is limited to 914 units, a nod to Maserati’s founding year, 1914. Pricing remains under wraps, but with this level of exclusivity and performance, expect it to command a hefty premium over the MC20. For the driving purist, this is as close to a road-legal race car as Maserati has ever built. And it’s utterly magnificent.   Also See: Aston Martin Vantage India review: split personality New BMW M5 track drive: Heavyweight champ",

    "description": "Unlike the mass-market segments, where most leading carmakers reported only marginal growth in the last financial year (FY2025) or even a decline in some cases, most luxury carmakers registered robust growth, and Mercedes-Benz continues to lead the pack. Let’s take a closer look. Mercedes-Benz 4 percent year-on-year growth   E-Class LWB was brand’s bestseller The E-Class LWB was the brand's bestseller in FY2025. Mercedes-Benz retailed 18,928 cars in India in FY2025, recording a 4 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth over the year-ago period. The company said this was also its highest-ever sales in a financial year. Once again, the new E-Class LWB has emerged as the brand’s bestselling model, as well as India’s bestselling luxury car. Mercedes claims its Top-End Vehicles (TEVs are cars costing over Rs 1.5 crore) saw a 34 percent growth with strong demand for the AMG G 63, Maybach Night Series and the new electric G-Class. Meanwhile, the EQS SUV was its bestselling EV in the last financial year, with overall sales of EVs growing by 51 percent. SUVs, unsurprisingly, dominated overall sales, comprising 60 percent of the total. However, in FY2025’s last quarter (Q4), which ended in March, Mercedes’ retail sales fell by 11.8 percent to 4,775 units. The brand attributes this to the decline of the entry-level segment; its TEV segment grew by 6 percent in the same period.   Jaguar Land Rover 40 percent year-on-year growth Defender was highest selling model Jaguar Land Rover sold 6,183 units in FY2025, a whopping 40 percent YoY growth. The company said this was its best-ever sales performance in the 17-year stint it has had in India. JLR India has witnessed strong growth, with annual retail sales more than doubling in the last two years. The fully imported Defender was JLR’s bestselling model, recording a strong 90 percent on-year growth. Meanwhile, the locally assembled Range Rover and Range Rover Sport SUVs also saw strong growth of 72 percent and 42 percent, respectively.   The Defender saw 90 percent year-on-year growth in FY2025. In Q4, JLR’s retail sales of 1,793 units were up 110 percent YoY, and dispatches rose 118 percent to 1,710 units – the highest ever in a quarter.   Lexus India 19 percent year-on-year growth NX SUV has been company’s best-seller Although Lexus India hasn’t given out a specific sales number, the company said it recorded a robust 19 percent on-year growth in FY2025. Meanwhile, Q4 also saw a strong 17 percent growth over the same period in the previous financial year, driven primarily by the Lexus NX SUV. The company also said the LM MPV has been in strong demand. Meanwhile, in March 2025, Lexus India recorded its highest-ever monthly sales to date, primarily on the back of the NX and RX SUVs. BMW and Audi Q4 FY2025 sales BMW and Audi haven’t revealed their entire FY2025 sales data, but both companies have shared the numbers for Q4. The 5 Series LWB was the brand's bestselling sedan in Q4 FY2025. BMW Group retailed a total of 3,914 cars (3,764 units of BMWs and 150 Minis) in the last quarter of FY2025, witnessing a 7 percent YoY growth. Of this, 646 units were EVs (BMW and Mini combined), a surge of 206 percent. The company said the new 5 Series LWB was its highest-selling sedan in this period, and other long-wheelbase models – 3 Series, 7 Series and iX1 – are also seeing strong demand. Meanwhile, SUVs made up 55 percent of BMW’s Q4 sales, with 2,079 units sold. Audi India’s Q4 sales rose 17 percent YoY to 1,223 units. The company's pre-owned car business, Audi Approved Plus, also showed significant growth with a 23 percent increase. Popular models driving the sales include the Q7 and Q8, while the newly launched RS Q8 is sold out until Q3 2025.

    "description": "The BMW Z4 M40i has just got a new special edition variant in India called the Pure Impulse edition. The big news is that it is the first time that BMW has offered a manual gearbox on the Z4 M40i, which has an ex-showroom price of Rs 97.90 lakh. There’s also the option of the 8-speed automatic, which, incidentally, costs less. The Pure Impulse edition also brings a few cosmetic updates inside and out, so let’s take a closer look. Z4 M40i Pure Impulse gets a 340hp inline 6-cylinder engine Available with 6-speed manual and 8-speed automatic gearbox options Gets two new colour options: Frozen Deep Green and Sanremo Green Below are the prices of the BMW Z4 M40i range in India: BMW Z4 M40i price (ex-showroom)Variant Price BMW Z4 M40i AT Rs 92.90 lakh BMW Z4 M40i Pure Impulse ATRs 96.90 lakh BMW Z4 M40i Pure Impulse MTRs 97.90 lakh Just like the regular Z4 M40i, the new Pure Impulse edition also comes to India as a full import. Its automatic gearbox-equipped variant costs Rs 4 lakh more than the standard car. BMW Z4 M40i Pure Impulse powertrain New 6-speed manual gearbox Under the Z4 M40i Pure Impulse edition’s hood is the familiar 3.0-litre, straight-6 turbo-petrol engine that produces 340hp and 500Nm of torque, sending power to the rear wheels. The most notable addition is the 6-speed manual gearbox, which is not available with the regular Z4 M40i; the 8-speed torque converter automatic has been carried over as is. BMW claims a 0-100kph sprint time of 4.5 seconds with the automatic gearbox, while the manual takes 4.6 seconds. BMW Z4 M40i Pure Impulse exterior and interior updates New staggered wheel setup, new colours The biggest cosmetic update on the Z4 M40i Pure Impulse is a new staggered wheel setup comprising 19-inch front and 20-inch rear M alloy wheels with a double-spoke design. The Pure Impulse edition also gets a red finish for the brake calipers and a gloss-black finish on the doors and wing mirror caps. BMW is also offering two new colour options – Frozen Deep Green and Sanremo Green – alongside the colours already available with the regular Z4 M40i. New leather upholstery Inside, the special edition roadster gets Vernasca Cognac leather upholstery (dual-tone black and beige) with contrasting stitching that’s exclusive to the manual variant. In contrast, the regular Z4 M40i gets black leather upholstery. The equipment list remains unchanged. So, the dual 10.25-inch instrument cluster and central touchscreen, dual-zone auto AC, ambient lighting, electrically adjustable front seats with memory function for the driver’s seat and wireless phone charger have been carried over. Plenty of optional extras BMW is also offering numerous optional extras with the Z4 M40i Pure Impulse edition. These include lumbar support for the driver and passenger, M seat belts, adaptive LED headlights, an interior and exterior Mirror Package, a Harman Kardon sound system, a parking assistant and a head-up display. Direct rival to Mercedes-Benz CLE Cabriolet The BMW Z4 is a direct rival to the Mercedes-Benz CLE Cabriolet, but as a manual 2-seat roadster, it really is in a territory of its own. The Pure Impulse variants will be limited-edition, says BMW. Also See: Bentley Continental GT, Flying Spur get new 680hp V8 hybrid New Chevrolet Corvette electric concept revealed",
