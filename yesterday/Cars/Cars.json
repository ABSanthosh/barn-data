    "description": "The Rynox Air GT gloves have been a compelling choice for urban riders seeking a balance between comfort, protection and affordability. Rynox has now updated them with some flexible rubber protection that covers the carpal bones for better abrasion resistance. While they remain the same overall, this new addition has driven up their price by Rs 700.  These gloves are crafted from perforated, soft, full-grain leather with additional leather panels in high-abrasion zones. They are designed to offer both durability and ventilation, making them pretty usable in our tropical climate. Flexible armour doesn’t compromise overall comfort. While Rynox says the fingers are pre-curved and don’t require any wear-in, these gloves felt a bit too rigid initially, and I found that they do require a bit of breaking in. After this, they feel quite comfortable, thanks partly to the accordion stretch panels, allowing for easier hand movements. The built-in touchscreen-compatible fingertips work well enough but don’t allow for very precise inputs due to the rounded edges on the fingertips, although this holds true for most gloves. Despite the leather construction these gloves have decent ventilation. The cuff has a small elastic panel that allows for easier ingress and egress of your hand. This, paired with the adjuster on the wrist, ensures a tight yet comfortable fit. In terms of protection, these gloves are CE certified to the EN 13594:2015 standard and offer TPU protectors with HD foam backing on the knuckles, HD foam inserts on the fingertips and joints and the newly added protection for the carpus bones.  The only change is the added protection on the palm. Despite our summer heat, these gloves feel decently ventilated and don’t add any discomfort to my commutes or rides. However, it’s worth noting that they are not waterproof, making them less ideal for the monsoons. While these gloves may not cater to high-speed touring or track days, they excel in city environments and short weekend getaways. Available in four colours, the Air GT are a solid pair for any beginner rider looking for nice gloves without breaking the bank.

    "description": "As India’s off-road riding community grows, so does the need for purpose-built but cost-effective machines. KTM’s 390 Enduro R and Kawasaki’s KLX230 offer two vastly different interpretations of what an accessible, dirt-focused bike should be. While there’s a huge gap in their performance, their price tag is where they are quite close. Both claim to be proper off-roaders, but which one truly fits the brief? KTM 390 Enduro R vs Kawasaki KLX230: Design and features Both motorcycles are designed to go off-road but take a different approach The 390 Enduro R may appear like a stripped-down 390 Adventure at first glance, but look closer, and you can appreciate KTM’s effort to keep its design unique. Based on the 390 Adventure platform, it gets a larger 18-inch rear wheel, a smaller 9-litre fuel tank, less bodywork, and off-road oriented tyres. The plastic tank and black panels look a tad budget and don’t seem like they’d age too well. The 4.2-inch TFT on the KTM is packed with information but doesn't get a fuel gauge While the dirty white panels give this motorcycle a proper “enduro” aesthetic, the premature discolouration is a bit concerning. That said, the rest of the motorcycle feels solidly built. The switchgear quality is good and feels tactile. The tiny TFT display looks premium, and it shows most of what you’d want to see, except for a fuel gauge, which would’ve been handy while exploring remote trails. The KLX230's monotone LCD is quite basic and misses out on a gear position indicator. In contrast, the Kawasaki KLX230 feels solid and has durable plastics and a no-nonsense design. Discolouration seems to be a common theme, and the KLX230’s dual-tone seat gets dirty fairly easily. It gets an LCD with basic information and a simple layout. While it includes a fuel gauge, it skips a rev counter and gear position indicator – features you will miss but can learn to live without. The switchgear feels budget and a tad rudimentary. It’s also worth mentioning that parts like the mirrors, indicators and levers, which are likely to get damaged off-road, cost significantly more for the KLX as it is a CKD import. KTM 390 Enduro R vs Kawasaki KLX230: Ergonomics Both bikes are ergonomically compromised in their own way. At 860mm, the KTM’s seat height is tall but not extreme, and riders around 5’7” should be able to get the balls of their feet down. The Enduro R has a nicer seat and is the better option if you ever need to ferry a pillion. Standing up on the Enduro R feels more natural, and over time, you’ll prefer riding it on your feet. The Enduro R also offers decent mounting points for luggage, and it will definitely be the better option if you intend to cover bigger distances to get to interesting locations. A noticeable flaw is the engine guard that will bump your knees, nudging you to stand. The KTM is better suited for standing up and riding. The KLX230 has a similarly upright posture, but its ergonomics feel a bit too forward-set while standing, especially for taller riders who will want a higher handlebar. On paper, it has a taller 880mm perch, but once seated on it, the suspension sags enough that even riders around 5’7” can touch down easier than the KTM. However, the narrow and firm standard seat quickly becomes uncomfortable on the road. The 390 Enduo R also has better seating ergonomics The more unusual challenge is getting the KLX230 off its stand – a task that needs to be done with the suspension unloaded, as the rear shock doesn’t allow the side-stand to retract when loaded. There are no built-in mounting points for luggage, but Kawasaki sells an accessory carrier. KTM 390 Enduro R vs Kawasaki KLX230: Performance and efficiency The 390 Enduro R outclases the KLX230 by a long shot in terms of performance This is where the two bikes couldn’t be more different. The Enduro R borrows its 399cc liquid-cooled engine from the other 390s and puts out the same 46hp and 39Nm – more than double the KLX’s peak output. However, on technical trails, this performance can be a bit much. Its motor doesn’t have much of a bottom end and then easily spins up the rear when the revs build. That said, the engine is decently tractable and rides well on the road with the same highway cruising performance as its Adventure siblings. Despite the tame nature, the 390 Enduro R is still a hoot on dirt. The engine may feel slightly tame for seasoned riders used to KTM’s raw nature, but that makes it surprisingly beginner-friendly. The Enduro R can cruise at triple-digit speeds all day and doesn’t feel out of place in traffic either. With its 9-litre tank, the KTM can achieve about 200km on a full tank in the real world. What makes the KTM even more manageable are its electronics – switchable ABS, a very effective off-road traction control, two riding modes, and a bi-directional quickshifter, all make life easier. Given the huge difference on paper, you’d expect the KLX230 to struggle, but it keeps up remarkably well off-road. It uses a simpler, smaller engine and there’s no sudden surge, but it has great bottom and mid-range. In fact, we definitely preferred this engine for off-road riding. Naturally, on road, the KTM easily leaves the Kawasaki behind, and anything above 90kph feels laboured; you also need to plan your overtakes. The lack of power allows the KLX230 to feel more stable and predictable off-road. Surprisingly, when ridden at higher speeds on- and off-road, there was only a 4kpl difference between the Kawasaki and the KTM. This is largely due to the KLX’s smaller engine that needs to work harder, and we often found that it needed filling sooner than the KTM. The KLX has no electronic aids apart from switchable ABS, but truth be told, it doesn’t need any. KTM 390 Enduro R vs Kawasaki KLX230: Ride and handling The KLX230 has much better off-road handling than the 390 Enduro R. The KTM gets adjustable suspension, but the India-spec bike gets reduced suspension travel compared to the export model, and we also found that the damping control can be improved. Ridden over the same rocky trails, the KTM is more bouncy and fights the same surfaces that the KLX glides over, which makes it tougher to manage. Reducing the compression damping to make it more compliant only results in a tendency to bottom out over jumps, so we elected to deal with the bounciness instead. The 390 Enduro R strikes a much better balance between road and off-road handling In tighter off-road sections, its 37kg weight disadvantage over the KLX also becomes noticeable and demands more from the rider. While the suspension lacks the plushness of the Kawasaki off-road, it shines on the tarmac. The Enduro R resists diving under braking, doesn’t squat under acceleration, and can be hustled in corners like a road bike despite its dual-purpose tyres. Thanks to the light weight, the KLX230 loves big jumps The KLX230’s suspension componentry is more basic, but despite that, it is far more capable off-road and soaks up imperfections with ease, giving riders more confidence to explore. It boasts 265mm of ground clearance, but that drops considerably with rider weight. The KLX is also more forgiving of rider mistakes, but push it, and it begins to show its limits, which is a reminder that neither of these bikes can be used for a very high level of off-road riding. On the road, the KLX’s dirt orientation is evident in the excessive front-end dive under braking. Yet, in our braking tests, the KLX was nearly on par with the KTM, thanks to its significantly lighter weight. The KLX230 isn't at home around corners and can feel too soft. The KLX changes direction easily, and it feels very light and nimble. However, its on-road handling is a bit vague and takes some getting used to. The MRF tyres are not bad, but the Mitas E-07s on the KTM are noticeably better. KTM 390 Enduro R vs Kawasaki KLX230: Verdict The KTM offers great value for just an additional Rs 6,000 At Rs 3.30 lakh, the simpler KLX’s value proposition feels a bit lopsided. It lacks features, and its highway manners aren’t comparable to the KTM’s. Kawasaki is reportedly working on a localised version, which could improve the price equation significantly, but that’s still some time away. Given the minimal price delta between the two, the 390 Enduro R makesa great case for itself. Still, the KLX230 is a charming little trail bike, and we enjoyed riding it off-road a lot more than the KTM. It’s unintimidating, lightweight, and promises to be reliable – the kind of machine that lets you explore and make mistakes without punishing you. As a second or third bike, it’s an excellent option. But as a one-bike solution? Only if you’re a true off-road maniac. For an additional Rs 7,000 over the KLX230, the 390 Enduro R offers higher performance, sophisticated electronics, and versatility. It’s more physically demanding off-road, but with enough skill and commitment, it will go where the KLX can while simultaneously being a more accomplished road bike. Its biggest shortcoming is its suspension, but KTM will bring in the international-spec longer-travel variant soon, albeit at a higher cost. For the small price delta between the two bikes, KTM’s 390 Enduro R makes a much stronger case for itself and is the better contender for a single-bike garage.

    "description": "Few cars are in greater need of a dose of context for Indian buyers than this one. Hear me out. It’s a large, premium hatchback, at a time when everyone has moved on to SUVs. And it’s powered by a potent 265hp 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine at a time when everyone is turning to EVs. So just what is it doing here? At long last, Volkswagen has brought the Golf to India, and to understand its significance to the German brand, know that it is the spiritual successor to none other than the Beetle. Sure, it’s grown into a premium hatchback now, but in 1974, it was the ‘new’ people’s car – the volks wagen. VW India says the market was never quite ready for something like this before, but it is now, and to sweeten the deal, it’s here in GTI hot-hatch guise. But then, it’s also a CBU import, which means the price is north of Rs 50 lakh. However, all 150 units of the first batch are booked at the time of this review, so clearly there’s a niche big enough to fit a large, sporty hatchback. 2025 Volkswagen Golf GTI exterior design and engineering – 7/10 Understated hatchback form, but instantly recognisable for those in the know. The Golf may be new to India, but a GTI is not – we had the old Polo GTI in India a few years ago, and it’s the easiest point of reference to help understand this car. The Golf sits a size up from the Polo, and is about the same size as luxury hatchbacks like the Mercedes-AMG A45 S and the now-discontinued BMW 1 Series and Volvo V40. Red band lining the grille is a signature GTI design element.  Where the old Polo GTI was a three-door hatch, the Golf GTI is five-door only, and is all the more practical for it. Its 4.3-metre length and 2.6-metre wheelbase are comparable to those of a Hyundai Creta, but its hatchback form and 136mm of ground clearance make it seem a lot smaller. There are plenty of hot GTI signatures, particularly up front, where a red band lines the grille and flows into the upswept Matrix LED headlamps. The band and the VW logo are illuminated, and lower down, you’ll find LED fog lamps neatly integrated into the gaping honeycomb grille that covers the air dam. 18-inch alloys are wrapped in 225/40 section tyres.  Smart-looking 5-spoke, 18-inch alloys fill the arches nicely, housing red brake calipers within, and there are black skirts running under the doors. The rear is capped by a small roof spoiler, some clever LED trickery in the tail-lights that animate on start-up, and a pair of real dual exhaust tips. These highlights aside, the shape is quite plain and clean cut, in true VW fashion. 2025 Volkswagen Golf GTI interior space and comfort – 8/10 Spacious and practical enough for four, with requisite sporty touches. The interior of this Mk8.5 Golf is, on its own, quite straightlaced too, but the good news is the GTI version is peppered with interesting details. It starts with the sports seats, which, though not leather upholstered, do have sporty Alcantara inserts, GTI stitched into the headrest and the signature tartan inserts running down the centre. Front sports seats have Alcantara and tartan inserts, but are not leather upholstered.  A Golf GTI signature that’s missing, however, is the gear lever shaped like a golf ball on a stick, which has made way for a basic-looking toggle switch. You’ll find plenty of red accents, stitching and trim pieces peppered around the cabin, and though the steering wheel looks similar to what you get in every other modern VW, it features a sportier grip. A 12.9-inch touchscreen takes centre stage, protruding up from the dashboard and causing quite a distraction in your line of sight. It’s paired with a 10.25-inch digital driver’s display that can be configured in a few different ways, and while the default setting follows the GTI red theme, there are a few other colour options. It’s a similar story with the discreet ambient lighting, which can be set to one of 30 colours. Interior is peppered with GTI-specific details with red accents and unique trim pieces.  Quality is typically VW good, but also typical, like with the exterior, is that the design is a bit too understated, livened up only by the sporty GTI flourishes. The front seats feel nice and snug and offer a good range of adjustment and a clean view out. The rear seat space is somewhere between a compact and a midsize SUV, having sufficient leg and head room, but being a little short on width for three passengers. Rear seat isn't the most accomodating for three abreast.  The boot volume is a solid 380 litres, though the load area feels larger than that; there is no spare tyre included here, though. 2025 Volkswagen Golf GTI features and safety – 7/10 Euro-spec safety kit is welcome but more of the options should have been included. Speaking of what’s included, at this price, the specification is interesting. This being a CBU import, you get a lot of what’s standard for a premium hatchback in Europe, like Matrix LED headlamps, LED tail-lamps, 3-zone auto climate control, a wireless phone charger, an AI-enabled voice assistant and the aforementioned screens. The touchscreen is pretty slick and logically laid out, but has no physical controls, save for touch-sensitive ‘slider’ indents for volume and temperature control, which make things slightly easier. No physical switchgear means AC controls are baked into the touchscreen.  They’ve even thrown in the sunroof, which is optional in Europe. However, there are many options available in Europe which haven’t been ticked for India, like the 9-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, leather seats with power adjust and cooling; these ones are only heated. But even if you’re not interested in frivolities like this, one option they should ticked for this performance car is DCC or adaptive dampers, which sadly, they have not. The Golf GTI gets 7 airbags, a rear-view camera, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, and autonomous emergency braking, on the safety front. 2025 Volkswagen Golf GTI performance and refinement – 9/10 No shortage of punch, and it’s well delivered too. Enticing burbles from the exhaust. Of utmost importance in a car like this is the performance and how it’s delivered. The latest GTI has been given a 265hp, 370Nm version of the popular EA288 2.0-litre TSI turbo-petrol engine that does duty in a number of VW Group cars, including the recently launched VW Tiguan and Skoda Kodiaq. Power is sent to the front wheels only via a 7-speed DSG dual-clutch transmission, but crucially, there is a limited-slip locking differential to help mete out all that torque. Golf GTI clocked a top-speed of 267kph at the NATRAX high-speed oval.  And it all comes together brilliantly. 0-100kph is dealt with in just 5.9 seconds, and we managed to do a quarter mile in just 14.005 seconds. Yes, some torque steer during a full-bore launch from standstill is, expectedly, present, but the GTI finds its grip and starts pulling very quickly. This version of the DSG gearbox also doesn’t waste any power between gears, and there’s little of that jerkiness or interruption that a lot of dual-clutch gearboxes suffer from. The pull stays strong, and on NATRAX’s high-speed oval, we managed to max it out at an indicated 267kph. Most impressive is how well understeer is contained in corners, thanks to that clever differential. Few front-wheel drive cars with this amount of power deploy it so effectively, and rather than washing wide, the GTI pulls into a corner even if you floor it. Few front-wheel drive cars steer as well as the Golf GTI, thanks to the clever differential.  Drive it gently in Comfort mode and it feels like any other VW Group TSI car with a DSG gearbox: smooth, refined and easy to drive. In Sport, the exhaust note is brought in through the speakers to amp things up, and though not incredibly loud, it gets the job done. Some owners will no doubt look to the aftermarket if they want more aural thrills. All things considered, the performance is more than ample, delivered smoothly and relentlessly, if a little clinically. 2025 Volkswagen Golf GTI mileage and fuel efficiency – 6/10 Not great, but par for the course for a performance vehicle. Single-digit fuel efficiency can be expected in real-world driving conditions. Though we were unable to test fuel economy on this performance-focused drive, expectations aren’t high. The WLTP rating for the Golf GTI in Europe is 13.70kpl-14.08kpl, and in real-world driving, expect it to drop into single digits. Moreover, turbo-petrol engines in general and VW TSI engines, in particular, tend to be very sensitive to your driving style, and even a hint of excited acceleration – as you would in a GTI – tends to see the economy figure plummet. 2025 Volkswagen Golf GTI ride comfort and handling – 9/10 Extremely playful and light on its feet; clever diff keeps torque in check well. It feels extremely eager to turn in; steering weighs up progressively There’s a distinctive handling characteristic to front-wheel-drive performance cars, hatchbacks in particular, that you don’t get in any other kind of car. Its enjoyment depends on the power being delivered effectively, which, as we’ve established, the GTI does well. It’s incredibly eager to turn into corners thanks to its quick steering that feels super light at first but then loads up progressively as you dole out the lock. In fact, it’s easy (and incredibly fun) to just hurl the car into one of the NATRAX handling track’s many corners and instantly induce oversteer; no handbrake needed here. And it’s manageable, so you can easily rein it back in if you feel you’ve overcooked it. It feels smaller, nimbler and tighter than its size suggests, and very similar to the old Polo GTI, rather than a larger version of it. With a kerb weight of 1,454kg, it’s heavy by hatchback standards, but feels about right for the performance on offer. It feels rock solid and calm even at speeds well north of 200kph Also impressive is how stable it feels at speed. Holding a steady 267kph on the heavily banked high-speed oval track felt rock solid and very calm, with no need for steering intervention to maintain the line. While ride is something we couldn’t evaluate properly, the few bumps and speed breakers we encountered were handled well on the 18-inch wheels, and the absence of DCC (Dynamic Chassis Control) was not missed. 2025 Volkswagen Golf GTI price and verdict – 7/10 Expensive, but worthwhile for the niche buyer who wants a compact performance car. Viewed in the context of its badge, size or body style, the Golf GTI doesn’t sound like good value for its asking price of over Rs 50 lakh. However, when you consider what it’s for and how it delivers on that front, it starts to make more sense. Fun – that’s what you’re paying for here, and for the 150 people that have put their deposit down, that’s what matters most. They won’t be concerned that it doesn’t have the ground clearance of an SUV, or the back seat of a sedan. They’ll like the snug bucket seats even though they’re not ventilated or powered. They might, however, be annoyed that it doesn’t get adaptive dampers, when the Tiguan R-Line does. The Golf GTI is expensive, but it delivers what it's meant to – fun – in spades! Expensive? Yes! Rational? Absolutely not. Emotional? Absolutely! It’s a purpose-built fun machine that’s designed to tug at your heartstrings, and as such, it currently has no rivals. Until the Skoda Octavia RS comes back, of course. Fun times ahead! Also See: VW Tiguan R-Line review: Is it worth Rs 50 lakh? Kia EV6 facelift review: Longer range, sharper styling",

    "description": "Some motorcycle manufacturers have dipped their toes in the custom scene, but few have dived in head first like Royal Enfield. The Indian marque has made motorcycle customization a core component of its marketing strategy. That’s a bone-dry way of saying they sponsor events, fund custom builds all over the world, and then tell people about them. I’ve been watching Royal Enfield’s Custom and Motorsport department grow for the past few years and wanted a piece of the action. My magazine, Sideburn, has a long history with the brand. We built a custom Bullet back in 2012 when Royal Enfield was at the very beginning of their explosion in popularity and selling roughly one million fewer bikes per year than they currently do.…",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/land-rover-defender-update-brings-styling-tweaks-new-touchscreen",
    "description": "Smoked rear lights and gloss black grille bar now standard, with prices starting at £57k The Land Rover Defender has been updated with a series of subtle styling tweaks and reworked interior technology, including a larger infotainment touchscreen. The exterior refresh includes a revised headlight design with a smaller centre section – said to provide a “distinctive” graphic when activated – as well as the application of a smoked tint to the rear lights. A gloss black grille bar becomes a standard fitment and the front and rear bumpers are now painted either silver or satin grey.  Inside, the revised Defender gets a larger, 13.1in touchscreen (up from the current 11.4in), which completely fills the gap between the centre console and the upper surface of the dashboard.  The update also introduces a driver-facing infrared camera on the steering column, which underpins the driver attention monitoring system mandated by the European Union’s GSR2 legislation. This triggers audio and visual alerts if it detects a driver is not paying attention to the road ahead, but it can be adjusted or disabled altogether using the driver assistance settings in the infotainment.  Land Rover’s adaptive off-road cruise control system is also being offered on the Defender for the first time, as an optional extra. Land Rover has yet to announce which powertrains it will offer in the updated Defender but the current line-up is not expected to change. This comprises a 3.0-litre twin-turbocharged diesel straight six with 246bhp or 345bhp; a 2.0-litre petrol plug-in hybrid with 296bhp and 30 miles of electric range; and a supercharged 5.0-litre petrol V8 with outputs of 419bhp, 493bhp or 518bhp.  The range-topping Defender Octa remains available, packing a 626bhp twin-turbocharged 4.4-litre V8 supplied by BMW. Prices for the updated Defender start at £57,135.",

    "description": "Quasi-rugged retro throwback gains the option of a petrol-electric powertrain Has the trend for retro-fuelled comebacks gone too far? Based on the Fiat Grande Panda Hybrid launch event, I’d say yes, it has. Not because of the car itself, you understand. Instead, someone within Fiat has clearly been listening to Now! 32 and decided it would be a great idea to ask Shaggy to re-record his 1990s hit Boombastic, except retitled – wait for it – Pandastic. And no, I’m not making that up.Thankfully, the Grande Panda is a far more welcome revival than that wretched tune now embedded in my head. We first sampled the raised hatchback in its pure-electric form but, as with other cars on Stellantis’s cost-conscious Smart Car platform, it can accept a hybrid powertrain: a 1.2-litre three-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine aided by a 29bhp electric motor mounted in the six-speed dual-clutch gearbox.With a starting price of £18,035, the Granda Panda Hybrid will take on the likes of the Dacia Duster and Citroën C3 in the compact, affordable SUV market – so can its Italian flair and Shaggy endorsement make it stand out in a competitive market?",

    "description": "Three years ago, the annual Pierer Mobility investor presentation revealed that KTM was working on an electric version of the Duke. Now, a prototype version of the E-Duke has been seen for the first time.  E-Duke uses chassis elements from 390 Duke It will likely be made in India A Husqvarna E-Pilen is also in the works This prototype has come to light thanks to a video shared by stunt rider Rok Bagoros, who has a close working relationship with KTM. The video was taken in KTM’s Motohall display area, which is at the company’s headquarters in Mattighofen, Austria. KTM E-Duke battery and range Could have a 5.5kWH battery pack No specification details are available, but the 2022 presentation stated that the KTM E-Duke would get a 10kW (nominal power) electric motor along with a 5.5kWh battery pack. That could result in a quick and engaging performance, although it would be hard to see a realistic range of over 100km with such a small battery pack – and that would be with some very well-behaved riding. KTM E-Duke chassis and underpinnings Closely related to the 390 Duke’s rolling chassis A battery pack of this size will result in a well-controlled weight figure. With some luck, this motorcycle could end up weighing well below the current 390 Duke, which tips the scales at 168kg. The comparison is a fair one, considering that the E-Duke prototype appears to use a closely related version of the 390 Duke’s rolling chassis. This includes the main trellis frame, aluminium swingarm, offset rear shock and even the wheels and brakes. The battery pack and motor are mounted down low, with the motor being where you’d expect to see an engine. Just like on a conventional KTM, the drive is sent to the rear wheel via a chain. However, things are interesting higher up, with a large hollow section where the front of the ‘fuel tank’ meets the headstock. This area appears to serve as an air intake for cooling the battery pack and/or electricals.  There’s also what looks like an integrated charging cable, which means that this bike may have an on-board charger, as we’ve seen with the Bajaj Chetak. An on-board charger would solve the issue most electric bikes face, where there’s no storage space to hold a bulky charger. KTM E-Duke design More futuristic take on the current Duke’s design language The main difference comes in the new subframe and the sharp bodywork, which looks like a more futuristic take on the current 390 Duke’s design language. The KTM theme is very much apparent with a big fuel tank, exaggerated fuel tank extensions and the deconstructed headlamp design that we’ve already seen in the new 990 Duke and 1390 Super Duke. Details that give away the fact this is still very much a prototype include the MotoGP-inspired air scoop that extends under the swingarm and the cool 3D-printed seat. This seat concept could be particularly interesting in a hot climate like ours, although keeping it clean might be a challenge. The rider faces a minimal cockpit with the typical wide handlebar and what appears to be the small 4.3-inch TFT display from the 390 Enduro R. Interestingly, KTM has gone for a scooter-style handbrake lever for the rear brake, although this is something the company does on its Freeride E-XC electric enduro bikes. KTM E-Duke likely to be made in India If the KTM E-Duke makes it to production, it will likely be made by Bajaj in India.

    "description": "Maharashtra has unveiled a bold new EV Policy 2025 designed to further accelerate the demand for electric mobility, which has witnessed strong growth over the past few years. The state Cabinet approved the new EV policy, which is effective for 5 years and has an allocation of Rs 1,993 crore – a 114 percent increase over the Rs 930 crore outlay that was part of the previous 4-year policy, which ended on March 31, 2025. With the new EV policy, the Maharashtra government is targeting a 30 percent EV adoption by 2030.  Maharashtra’s new EV policy has incentives of up to Rs 2 lakh for 4-wheel EVs EVs can also avail of toll-free travel on select expressways Maharashtra accounted for 12.52 percent of India’s FY2025 EV sales New Maharashtra EV Policy 2025: benefits for car buyers E-buses and 4-wheel EVs for transport or commercial use can avail benefits  As per the new EV policy, incentives of up to Rs 2 lakh can be availed on electric 4-wheelers used for transport, and for e-buses, benefits worth Rs 20 lakh are available. Up to 25,000 4-wheelers and 1,500 buses will get these incentives. It should be noted that while the previous policy had capped the benefits at Rs 1.75 lakh for privately owned electric 4-wheelers, this new policy specifically states incentives are for transport or commercial 4-wheelers only. Road tax and registration fee exemption continues As before, all EVs registered and sold in Maharashtra will continue to be exempted from motor vehicle tax and registration fees. To further promote zero-emission mobility in the state, the policy has made travel toll-free for all 4-wheeled passenger EVs and buses on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi Mahamarg and Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (Atal Setu). Charging infrastructure mandate The policy also envisages the installation and availability of charging stations every 25 km on state and national highways to help alleviate EV users’ range anxiety. Further, the policy aims to have at least one EV charging station at every government office parking space and at least one community EV charging point in every new residential building. Meanwhile, new commercial buildings must allocate 50 percent of parking space for EV charging, but for older commercial properties, that requirement is 20 percent.   Maharashtra ranks second in EV sales in FY25 17,133 electric passenger vehicles (up 21 percent) sold in Maharashtra in FY2025 Maharashtra is home to several EV players, such as Tata Motors, Mahindra, Force Motors, Bajaj Auto, Kinetic Group and Piaggio, which have a manufacturing unit in the state. In the financial year that ended on March 31, 2025 (FY2025), the state was ranked second on the all-India EV ownership scale, with 2,46,221 units sold, comprising 12.52 percent of India’s EV sales. The state also has bragging rights for being No. 1 in e-2-wheelers, electric cars, e-SUVs and e-commercial vehicles. In India, 11,49,641 e-2-wheelers were sold in FY2025, and Maharashtra had the largest share of 18 percent with 2,11,880 units, up 15 percent year on year (YoY). Likewise, in electric cars, the state led the charge with 17,133 units (up 21 percent YoY), and it comprised 16 percent of the 1,07,782 e-passenger vehicles sold in India. The state accounted for 24 percent (2,104 units, up 24 percent) of the e-buses sold. In the ten calendar years since 2015, 7,13,986 EVs have been retailed in Maharashtra, shows data from Vahan.
