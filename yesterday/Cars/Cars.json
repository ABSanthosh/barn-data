    "description": "Mercedes’ van-based MPV offers economical diesel engines and up to eight seats, but it commands a hefty premium compared with rivals One can make a case that it’s vans such as the Mercedes V-Class – and not the SUVs we’re plied with – that today come closest to mastering the art of the lifestyle vehicle.It’s why you find so many MPV owners, never to return to the SUV fold, eulogising the utility and surprising opulence of their boxy (and sometimes quite expensive) wheels.Playing into this is the fact that the ‘van with windows’ market has recently become more desirable and competitive than ever. Volkswagen has its understatedly charming Multivan; Ford’s Tourneo Custom has a panoramic roof; and the new Lexus LM, with its Mark Levinson sound system, is pitched as something to go up against the BMW 7 Series.As an established player in this area (one in which its compatriots Audi and BMW still have never so much as dabbled), Mercedes-Benz needs to keep up, and so it has updated the V-Class for 2024, with a sharper exterior design and an overhaul of the infotainment system.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/wrangler-wild-green-laning-boss-jeep-uk",
    "description": "4x4 Wrangler makes light work of rocky lanes in the Lake District Jeep has a reputation for treading its own, unique path – and its UK boss is keen to leverage that more Kris Cholmondeley has packed his wetsuit and says he’s happy to take a dip in Windermere if we’d like some photos of that. Clearly, the boss of Jeep UK is up for demonstrating an on-brand adventurous lifestyle – and it’s not just for show. He’s a keen runner and has tackled events such as the Celtman!, an ‘extreme triathlon’ so brutal you’ll need a lie-down after simply reading the course profile. “I’ve always been an outdoor type and I’m really focused on mental health,” he says. “Getting outdoors into the countryside has multiple benefits. It’s good for the body, good for the mind.” For this Lake District outing, though, the wetsuit can stay packed away. Our day does start by crossing Windermere, but instead of swimming we take the cable ferry that forms part of the B5285. On board is a small convoy of Jeep Wranglers, including Cholmondeley’s own company car. Since being named Jeep’s UK managing director in late 2023, Cholmondeley has introduced a number of initiatives to help the brand reinforce its go-anywhere, off-road roots. These include partnering the Green Lane Association (GLASS) to encourage Jeep owners to responsibly take to the UK’s 6000 or so miles of legal unpaved byways. As part of that, Jeep dealers will help direct buyers to accessible green lanes nearby. In case you’re concerned, especially as motorised vehicles aren’t always a popular sight on byways, he insists the scheme will be done “respectfully”. He adds: “It’s not about going and rinsing the car at 30mph down a trail. It’s about adventure and freedom, and respecting all forms of it.” Cholmondeley first outlined this concept to me last year, but sat in a windowless meeting room above the multi-brand Stellantis \u0026 You Bristol dealership located next to the M5 motorway, it was hard to make the concept feel real. So I joked that he should show his commitment to the idea and take me green-laning. And, well, a few months later, as the cable ferry docks in Far Sawrey, Cholmondeley passes me the keys to his Wrangler and jumps into the passenger seat. The focus for today is on a different type of BOAT: we’ll be taking to Byways Open to All Traffic, unpaved roads that remain open and legal for motorised vehicles to use. The need to understand the various different types of byway can be a factor in making green-laning feel a little impenetrable to newcomers. It’s one ofthe problems Jeep is out to solve. We’re being led by professional 4x4 expedition leader Russell Dykes. That’s partly because he’ll save us from having to scour OS maps to find the lanes but also because the green lanes we’ll be tackling today are a little bumpier than some. Many byways can be traversed by any vehicle with four-wheel-drive capability; some of the paths we’ll be taking today will showcase the Wrangler’s remarkable off-road abilities. As we turn off the paved road onto The Fox, a byway that leads up through Grizedale Forest, Dykes comes on the radio with instructions to switch into four-wheel-drive low mode, enable the diff locks and detach the sway bar of our Rubicon-spec cars. That feels quite extreme for a byway, but the path ahead is essentially a stone trail, with some fairly large jagged rocks sticking up. Dykes says the biggest risk is sidewall damage to the chunky 32in tyres and the best way to avoid that in a car with the Wrangler’s capability is to drive over big rocks, rather than go round them.  Of course, he isn’t driving a car belonging to the boss of Jeep UK, who is rather hoping to drive it home undamaged later. “Don’t worry: you won’t damage it,” shrugs Cholmondeley, with enviable confidence in his product but perhaps excess confidence in my ability. Still, the Wrangler’s four skid plates and side rails should help. Cholmondeley is an unlikely figure to be running Jeep UK. He openly admits he didn’t grow up a massive car fan, for one thing. “I’m passionate about people,” he says. “The reason I’m in this industry is because it’s been good to me and I can make a big impact on the quality of a lot of people’s lives.” He arrived in the car world almost by accident, doing a placement year with Peugeot while studying marketing at university. “After I graduated, they invited me back,” he says. “Well, I’m a lazy 20-year-old and I’ve done a job I quite like, so of course I go back.” In the two decades or so since then, he’s worked his way through a variety of roles within PSA/Stellantis: sales and marketing, customer care, media and PR, dealer relations, product planning and more. He reached the level of UK marketing director for Peugeot when “the stars aligned – or you could call it a lack of talent succession planning”, and now former Stellantis UK boss Maria Grazia Davino offered him the role of Jeep UK managing director. He praises Davino for “trusting her instincts” but it’s clear his broad experience has given him a well-rounded set of skills. I reckon that includes a friendly demeanour and ability to keep calm under pressure, given Cholmondeley is able to talk eloquently about his job while I’m steadily bouncing his Jeep over a series of rocks. There’s a certain dissonance behind the wheel: the Wrangler’s suspension is so impressive that you barely feel a ripple when clambering over large bumps. It’s only when snapper Max Edleston shouts to me to stop so he can get photos of the Wrangler with every wheel in a different alignment that I start to grasp exactly what we’re taking on. It helps that I can follow Dykes’ lines rather than having to pick out my own, but the Wrangler is remarkably confidence-inspiring. My job has given me several chances to drive off-roaders on a variety of trails and test tracks but, as Cholmondeley notes, you gain a better appreciation of the Wrangler’s ability on a natural byway such as this rather than an artificial venue. Later sections of The Fox are smoother, in part because sections of Grizedale are used for stage rallies, before we drop back onto paved roads for a bit and then turn onto Nibthwaite. Green-laning is a slow-speed activity (the GLASS code of conduct recommends a top speed of 12mph and the fastest we go today is accelerating into a water splash so that Edleston can get a more dramatic shot) but even over a short distance it’s notable how quickly the scenery changes. Nibthwaite runs steeply uphill onto open moorland, where there are stunning views in all directions. We’ve passed two cyclists and two dog walkers in the last hour and a half (all greeted with a courteous wave and a hello) and there are no signs of life as far as the eye can see. On a bright spring day, it’s hard to think of anywhere you would rather be. We pause here while Edleston deploys his drone, and as Cholmondeley takes in the views, he reflects: “I’m privileged to work for a brand that encourages enjoying the great outdoors.” One of his focuses – and a key reason for the green-lane test drive initiative – is for Jeep to “play to our strengths”. He adds: “There are too many brands that are too similar. I’m always saying ‘be less beige, be more Jeep’.” Cholmondeley has commissioned a series of ‘campfire tales’ booklets for dealerships highlighting the brand, and with more composure than you would expect from someone watching a journalist drive his car perilously close to the edge of a trail, he rattles off tales about the origins of the seven-slot grille, Jeep’s Purple Heart medal and a string of Wrangler-owning celebrities. He notes that Jeep is the only car brand in the dictionary and adds: “We’ve got a brilliant brand that people are aware of, but you have to remind people about Jeep’s history.” \"That’s where his marketing experience comes in. “It’s the importance of clarity and narrative,” he says. “You can have a great PowerPoint, but you need to be able to shape a clear vision and strategy.” Clear vision and strategy are also useful when navigating green lanes, especially when another short road section brings us to Hodge Close. The byway here passes some old farm buildings before working its way past an old slate quarry. It’s another stone track and illustrates, Dykes is quick to point out, that perceptions of motor vehicles tearing up and damaging byways are misplaced: there’s no mud or dirt to tear up. The track is nothing the Wrangler can’t handle, but we have to brush past some scenery – I wince more than Cholmondeley whenever I hear some branches thwacking the side of his Wrangler – and there are plenty of sharp-edged stones that could easily take out a tyre’s sidewall. Following Dykes’ advice, I aim straight for them. One particularly challenging section involves a tight double hairpin while running over some especially big boulders. It looks dramatic but again, from inside the Wrangler, it’s remarkably smooth. Dykes warns that some of the bigger rocks might just tap the Wrangler’s underbody, which makes me a little nervous, so I’m pleased to make it up to the top without any real drama. Behind us, Jeep PR Manesh Taank is following in a third Wrangler, and despite being a born-and-bred south Londoner, he shows a remarkable natural aptitude for traversing countryside byways, making the section look ridiculously easy. Hodge Close is stunning. Just after the byway rejoins the road, we stop briefly to stare down into a flooded section of the quarry. It’s hugely popular with both climbers and divers, the sort of place that really encapsulates enjoying the natural world responsibly. You would have to be a pretty serious diver to take on some of the flooded mine tunnels, much as tackling the byways we’ve traversed today was easier for being in a pretty serious machine. But many green lanes are accessible for more standard 4x4s and Jeep’s hope is that it can use the GLASS partnership to help cement the capability link between the Wrangler and road-biased sibling models such as the Avenger, which will soon gain a four-wheel-drive hybrid variant. That remains a big challenge. Jeep’s recent history in the UK has been as uneven as the terrain we’ve been clambering over today. There have been sales hits, but they’ve been inconsistent, and Jeep has long struggled to leverage the strength of the Wrangler’s reputation onto more road-biased models. Cholmondeley’s broad experience should help. His most recent role was in marketing but stints in dealer relations, strategy and pricing mean he’s equally comfortable talking about dealer network growth and margins. He admits the latter doesn’t sound too exciting but is absolutely key to customer confidence. “What we’ve lacked in the past is a consistent cadence of new models – it’s been feast or famine – and when we’ve had good products, we’ve been greedy in trying to grow too much too soon and we haven’t looked after residual values,” he says. He notes that the Avenger, the brand’s current best-seller, is above the class average for residuals “because of how we’re selling it in a controlled way” and insists that sets Jeep up for growth with its forthcoming line-up expansion. “We’ve got a huge amount of products coming, which is really exciting,” says Cholmondeley. The next-gen Compass will arrive first, and sitting in one of the biggest market segments represents a massive growth driver. That will be followed by two potential brand shifters: the upmarket Wagoneer S large SUV and the Recon, a sort of EV version of the Wrangler. The Recon is the future model that Cholmondeley is “most excited about” because it will “take everything that’s enduring about the Wrangler and modernise it. The best example is to look at the old Defender and new Defender.” He’s excited about the prospect of electrification in off-roaders, for both the instant torque and the extra tranquillity silent propulsion could offer in beautiful countryside. But experiencing that will have to wait for another green-lane outing in a few years. As for now, we’re back on the Lake District’s main roads and there’s just time to take in the stunning scenery as we round the lake and return to Bowness-on-Windermere. Cholmondeley drops me off here, because he’s got important back-to-back meetings to dial into while he drives south, and he needs to be home in time to take his son to a sporting event. Thankfully, I’ve left his Wrangler unscathed, which probably says more about the vehicle’s capabilities than my own. Still, if the aim of Jeep’s green-lane initiative is to encourage people to head to the countryside more often, consider me hooked.",

After six months of snow and rain, the itch sets in for all the ill-advised marketplace transactions, wild pet projects and trips we’d like to take. With summer and hope on the horizon, we scoured the shop for something entertaining to do after hours—something just for fun—and the perfect project was in the corner gathering dust. Sipping and Swiping I can trace the genesis of this idea back to a particular Whiskey Wednesday in June of 2023. Somehow, Jeff had stumbled upon a small air-cooled diesel engine on Amazon selling for a measly $179.99.

    "description": "Launched in 2022 as Kia’s first EV in India, the EV6 has always stood out for its striking design, innovative cabin and punchy performance. There’s now an updated version out that promises more range, and we’ve put it through its paces to see how it performs. Kia EV6 Range and Efficiency - 9/10 Larger 84kWh battery translates into an impressive 498km combined real-world range. Composed road manners, hushed cabin make it a relaxing drive. With this facelift, the EV gets a new, larger 84kWh Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) battery, replacing the older 77.4kWh unit. This new battery is not only more energy-dense but also lighter. The WLTP range has increased to 581km, up by 53km. Impressively, in real-world conditions, we managed a combined range of 498km, which is closer than usual to the official figure. City driving yielded an efficiency of 5.18km/kWh, which translates to a usable range of around 435km. Interestingly, highway efficiency was even better at 6.67km/kWh, delivering a range of approximately 560km. It’s worth noting, however, that ambient temperatures rose by 12 degrees during our city run, which meant the AC was working harder to keep the cabin cool, impacting efficiency. Also, while we used Level 3 (out of 4) regen braking in the city, it wasn’t strong enough to bring the car to a complete halt and didn’t recoup much. As for charging, the EV6 supports ultra-fast DC charging at speeds of up to 350kW, allowing it to go from 10 to 80 percent in just 18 minutes. Kia EV6 Exterior Design and Engineering - 9/10 Gets new headlights, bumpers and alloys; still based on the born-EV E-GMP skateboard platform. On the outside, changes to the EV6 are subtle but impactful. The most noticeable update is the new headlights, which now feature a hook-like LED DRL signature, adding to the futuristic appeal, and there’s a full-width LED strip connecting the headlights. The facelift is offered exclusively in the sportier GT-Line trim in India. There are new bumpers at both ends and a fresh design for the 19-inch alloy wheels. Minor tweaks to the LED elements in the rear lightbar further refine the appearance. Under the skin, it continues to be based on the E-GMP skateboard platform, with its advanced 800V electrical architecture, shared with the Hyundai Ioniq 5. The EV6 remains a substantial car, measuring nearly 4.7 metres in length and 1.9 metres in width, with a generous 2.9-metre wheelbase. Kia EV6 Interior Space and Comfort - 8/10 Comfy front seats feature heating, ventilation and a zero-gravity mode; rear seat wide enough for three adults, but you’re sat in a knees-up position. Rear is spacious for three, but you’re sat knees-up. Step inside, and you’ll find that the cabin retains its familiar layout but with some updates. A more conventional three-spoke steering wheel replaces the old two-spoke unit, the dashboard gets new textures, and the screens get new software and a user interface. The twin 12.3-inch high-definition screens are crisp and intuitive, with logically arranged menus. While they operate smoothly, they are prone to reflections, and the new minimalist themes, though modern, can appear a bit sparse. It’s also worth noting that the fingerprint scanner seen at the Auto Expo 2025 is absent in the version on sale. New UI is easy to use, logically laid out, and follows a minimalist theme. Comfort levels are high, especially in the front seats, which offer firm but supportive cushioning. A standout feature is the zero-gravity mode, allowing the front occupants to fully recline and relax when the car is stationary. The rear bench is spacious enough to accommodate three adults with ease. There’s ample knee and headroom, and the backrest reclines for additional comfort. However, thigh support is compromised due to the high floor, and window blinds have been given a miss. Boot space stands at a respectable 490 litres, but the compartment is shallow. There’s also a frunk, though it’s small at 20 litres.   Kia EV6 Performance and Refinement - 9/10 Performance is strong and feels seamless to drive; wind and road noise is well-contained. The EV6 continues with the same dual-motor setup, producing 325hp and 605Nm. The claimed 0-100kph time is 5.3sec (just 0.1sec slower than before), but we managed a quicker 5.16sec in our testing. Roll-on acceleration is impressive too, with 20-80kph despatched in 2.77sec and 40-100kph in 3.49sec. Performance, then, remains a strong suit. The EV6 feels very natural to drive, thanks to well-calibrated acceleration. Unlike EVs of old, the EV6 serves up its power in a progressive manner rather than in one big chunk, which aids drivability. The all-wheel-drive system also ensures excellent traction, helping put down the power effectively. Drive modes alter the car’s behaviour – Eco softens responses to maximise efficiency, Sport sharpens everything up, and Individual lets drivers customise settings to their preference.

When it comes to ride and handling, the EV6 strikes a good balance. Around corners, it feels confident and composed, with good grip levels. The steering offers decent weight in Sport, though it lacks feedback. Despite riding on large 19-inch wheels, the EV6 maintains good ride comfort. It can feel a touch firm at lower speeds but settles nicely as you go faster, delivering a pliant and absorbent ride. There are some vertical movements at higher speeds, but they’re well-contained. Cabin insulation is impressive, too, with minimal wind or road noise. Kia EV6 Features and Safety - 9/10 Features two 12.3-inch screens, Meridian audio system, ADAS tech and has V2V, V2L capabilities.  The EV6 remains generously equipped. Highlights include a sunroof, heated and ventilated front seats, two 12.3-inch displays, wireless smartphone integration, wireless charging, ambient lighting, a head-up display, and a top-tier 14-speaker Meridian audio system. A larger sunroof would’ve helped the sense of space, especially given that the upholstery is black. On the safety front, it features 8 airbags, a 360-degree camera, and a comprehensive ADAS suite. This includes adaptive cruise control, autonomous emergency braking, and lane-keep assist. Additionally, the EV6 supports both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-load (V2L) functions, enabling it to charge other EVs or power external appliances. Kia EV6 Price and Verdict - 7/10 A well-rounded and premium package, with great real-world performance and range. Imported as a completely built unit (CBU), the Kia EV6 facelift is priced at Rs 65.97 lakh (ex-showroom, India), which positions it higher than its rivals, such as the Ioniq 5, BMW iX1 LWB and BYD Sealion 7. However, some dealerships are offering substantial discounts, which could bring it into your budget. Overall, the Kia EV6 continues to impress with its futuristic styling, premium interiors, and generous features list. Performance remains strong, and the improved real-world range makes it even more appealing. While it may lack a premium badge, the EV6 delivers a genuinely premium experience and stands out as one of the most well-rounded EVs on sale today.

    "description": "The Kia Carens range has received a major rejig following the debut of the Carens Clavis earlier this week. Every Carens variant barring the Premium(O) trim has been discontinued, which also brings significant changes to the MPV’s powertrain offerings. Kia Carens is now available in only one variant at Rs 11.41 lakh Carens does not get sunroof, Level 2 ADAS, 6-seat layout, ventilated seats, etc anymore Automatic gearbox options axed from Carens range as well Kia Carens variants discontinued Carens range now starts from Rs 11.41 lakh The Carens can only be had in the one-above-base Premium(O) trim going forward. Prior to this overhaul, the Carens was available in nine variants: Premium, Premium (O), Gravity, Prestige, Prestige (O), Prestige Plus, Prestige Plus (O), Luxury Plus, and X-Line. Kia has now pulled eight of these trims from sale, leaving only the one-above-base Carens Premium(O) variant available for purchase, which starts at Rs 11.41 lakh (ex-showroom). The Premium(O) trim misses out on features like ventilated seats, automatic climate control, alloy wheels, Level 2 ADAS, leatherette upholstery, ambient lighting, push button start/stop, cruise control, a sunroof, and a 6-seat layout, which are now absent from the wider Carens range. Automatic gearbox options discontinued entirely Additionally, while the Carens Premium(O) variant can be had with all three engine options - a 115hp, 1.5-litre petrol engine, a 116hp, 1.5-litre turbo-diesel unit, and a 160hp, 1.5-litre turbo-petrol motor - it does not offer the choice of an automatic gearbox. The petrol and diesel engines can only be configured with a 6-speed manual, while the turbo-petrol unit comes with a 6-speed iMT, which means that the 7-speed dual-clutch and 6-speed torque converter automatic transmissions are no longer available for the Carens.

    "description": "After teasing them earlier in the week, Honda has launched the E-Clutch variants of the CB650R (Rs 9.60 lakh) and CBR650R (Rs 10.40 lakh). Both variants are Rs 40,000 more expensive than their standard counterparts.  CB650R, CBR650R E Clutch are very similar to standard models E Clutch system adds 2.8kg to kerb weight Both bikes available in two colours - red and black Honda CB650R and CBR650R E Clutch models launched Both bikes weigh 2.8kg more than the base model The Honda CB650R and CBR650R are identical to the standard bike, save for its innovative clutch system, which allows the rider to make gearshifts, come to a halt, and take off from a standstill without operating the clutch. The clutch lever isn’t omitted on these E-Clutch variants, and the rider can take manual control whenever they choose to. The standard versions of the CB650R and the CBR650R as well as their E-Clutch variants are both powered by the same liquid-cooled, 649cc inline four-cylinder engine, producing 95hp at 12,000rpm and 63Nm at 9,500rpm. The 6-speed gearbox and its ratios are the same between the bikes, and the only difference is in how you operate it. The rest of the chassis and the feature-set too on the E-Clutch bikes is identical to the standard versions and the only difference is in terms of weight. The E-Clutch system adds 2.8kg to the total weight.  Both the CB and the CBR are available in two colour options - black and red - and bookings are open for the two E-Clutch Honda 650s now. Currently, the CB650R and CBR650R E Clutch variants are one of very few bikes in India available with an ‘assisted’ clutch system, the only other being the BMW R 1300 GS models.  Also See: Honda CB650R vs Triumph Trident 660 comparison",
