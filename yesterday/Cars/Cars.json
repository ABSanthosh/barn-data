Mostly, they were quirky oil-dripping British bikes or nefarious “love ’em or hate ’em” Harley-Davidsons. The truth is, 1960s America was car crazy. Even 16-year-old kids could afford cars and gas was practically free. The tide began to turn, however, in the late ’60s when the avalanche of Japanese manufacturing technology hit America’s shores. Baby boomers had suddenly become a major purchasing force and motor vehicles evolved from practical and utilitarian to fun and exciting. In motorcycle terms, we all know what happened: four-cylinder overhead cam bikes from Honda suddenly became the new world standard for performance and reliability.…",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/volvo-es90-bmw-i5-rival-lands-march-kickstart-ev-onslaught",
    "description": "ES90 will serve as the premium flagship in a wave of five advanced EVs... ES90 is the first of five all-new electric Volvos set to use advanced tech Volvo is gearing up to launch the ES90 as its first electric saloon early next year – and it will serve as a premium flagship for the firm’s next wave of five advanced EV models. The new BMW i5 and Mercedes-Benz EQE rival is a sibling model to the combustion-engined S90 and will be revealed next March at an event in Stockholm, Sweden. It has been developed with a focus on the Chinese market, although it will be sold worldwide. The ES90 will be closely related to the EX90 electric SUV and, much like that model, will serve as a technological figurehead rather than a driver of sales volume. It will be followed in 2026 by the new EX60, which will sit on a new-generation platform and, as the EV equivalent of the bestselling XC60 in the core medium SUV segment, will be key to growing Volvo’s electric car sales. Volvo currently has three further EVs in development. The new platform beneath the EX60 will accommodate a wider range of bodystyles, potentially including an electric estate. And while Volvo is still focused on ultimately becoming an EV-only brand, it has delayed plans to end the sale of plug-in and mild-hybrid models and is instead set to refresh and renew its combustion-engined lineup in the coming years. ES90 saloon to be new premium range-topper The ES90 will be the fifth series-production electric Volvo model to be offered in the UK – following the EX30, XC40/EX40, C40/EC40 and EX90 – but the first that isn’t an SUV. (Volvo also offers the EM90 MPV in China.) That reflects the current sales dominance of SUVs but, speaking recently, Volvo boss Jim Rowan said the firm will continue to offer a diverse line-up in future. “We have MPVs as well as sedans [saloons] and wagons and of course SUVs,” he said. “We’re in a nice position as a company that we have that spread.” Rowan added that even though SUVs are likely to continue to make up the bulk of sales, there was enough profi t to justify launching an electric saloon. “We’re 1% of the car market and we’re in premium,” he said. “There is still a demand for premium saloons in the electric age. We see more of that [demand] in China, but there’s still demand in other parts of the world.” Rowan noted that Chinese premium buyers prefer saloons with “really long leg room” in the back and said the ES90 will be developed with that market as a core focus. Volvo’s preview image of the ES90 confirms that the model will feature a similar side profile to that of the current hybrid S90 and it will also take styling cues from the EX90, including the closed-off grille, ‘Thor’s hammer’ headlights and upright rear lights. The ES90 will sit on the bespoke electric SPA2 platform that is used by the EX90 and it is likely to be a close technical relation to that model. Information leaked last year shows that the model has been developed under the codename V551 and will be produced at a plant owned by Volvo parent Geely in Zhejiang, China. The leak reveals that the ES90 will be 4999mm long, making it marginally longer than the S90, and have a wheelbase of 3100mm to maximise interior space. It will be offered in single-motor rear-wheel-drive and dual-motor all-wheel-drive forms. Power outputs are likely to match the EX90’s, suggesting that the all-wheel-drive model will be offered with 402bhp as standard and 502bhp in Performance form. It is also likely to offer many of the EX90’s safety features, potentially including the lidar scanner, and have a similar, near-£100,000 price. Power will come from a 111kWh battery that will offer up to 373 miles for the single-motor model. As with the EX90, the vehicle will be built around an advanced Volvo Cars Superset ‘tech stack’, which effectively comprises all of the software and hardware for the drive, infotainment, autonomous functions and other systems. That set-up will be used on all future models and offers over-the-air updates. The goal is that it will eventually allow updates to be rolled out across all Volvo models. EX60 to help drive mainstream EV uptake from 2026 The XC60 has long been Volvo’s best-selling model, with Rowan describing it as the “workhorse” of the line-up, so it is notable that Volvo has waited for EV technology to develop before launching an electric equivalent. But that model, the EX60, will arrive in 2026 and Volvo chiefs have previously described it as a “huge boost” in the firm’s electrification plans. Notably, the EX60 will be the first model to use the new SPA3 platform, which is effectively a heavy development of SPA2. It will feature deeper integration of the core computing software stack, but the primary focus is that it’s designed to be far more scalable: Volvo says it can accommodate cars smaller than the EX30 and larger than the EX90. The platform will also enable the use of parts produced by megacasting, a process that Volvo will introduce at its main Torslanda factory in Gothenburg. This will allow entire sections of cars to be produced as single parts rather than as large numbers of individual parts, with the rear floor section of the EX60 likely to be the first to benefit from it. This method cuts production costs, increases rigidity and makes the parts lighter. Few technical details of the EX60 have been revealed but, like the ES90, it will be offered in singleand dual-motor forms and use the same advanced infotainment system. Electric estate on the cards for future line-up The arrival of the ES90 and EX60 will give Volvo six EVs in the European market. Three further models are also in development, with Rowan saying that “some of them will be an electrification of our current models and some will take us into new segments”. The only models in Volvo’s current combustion line-up that aren’t confirmed to get a direct electric equivalent are the S60 saloon and the V60 and V90 estates. Volvo has a rich history of estates, but the demand for such models has waned in recent years and they aren’tpopular in the crucial Chinese market. However, when asked about electric estates recently, Rowan hinted that the firm is “looking at that”. The prospect of electric estates could be heightened by the new SPA3 platform, because with all cars based on a single platform and tech stack, it would be easier to produce different variants on the same production lines, which would potentially enable Volvo to expand its line-up more efficiently. Erik Severinson, Volvo’s planning chief, recently told Autocar that “we have almost underestimated the power” of having a single tech stack and platform.  He added: “If you do all your cars with unique technological solutions, you’ll spend all your time and efforts just keeping stuff updated. It’s a hell of a work just to manage your variant complexity. But if you have them all on the same tech stack, it creates freedom to make the cars better. “That’s why SPA3 and the tech stack is such an important part of our journey. If we have that architecture in all our plants, and all our products based on it and a single computing system, we can focus on making the cars better. That will give us a lot of flexibility going forward.” Hybrid and plug-in models to be refreshed Volvo recently rowed back on its aim to sell only EVs by 2030, which Rowan described as a “pragmatic” move that reflected the slowdown in EV sales growth. The firm is now aiming for EV and PHEV models to account for at least 90% of sales by 2030, with the rest mild hybrids. Partly in response to that, Volvo is set to refresh much of its combustion line-up in the coming years, following the revamped XC90 that was unveiled earlier this year. This could include substantial updates for the current XC60, which dates from 2017, and the XC40. Although Severinson declined to comment on individual products, he highlighted strong sales of the XC60 PHEV and said: “In times of unpredictability, flexibility is important. We have very strong plug-in hybrid offerings and that is something we will continue to invest in to make sure we maintain our strong position with those products.”",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/jaguar/e-pace-2017-2024",
    "description": "Can Jaguar’s compact SUV bring enough flair and dynamic polish to make it a tempting used buy? When it launched, the Jaguar E-Pace diversified the brand away from its regular crop of buyers by appealing to a younger and trendier audience.And this bold move proved successful, with the compact SUV having scored almost 100,000 sales across Europe to date.The F-Type sports car had the biggest influence on the E-Pace’s design, with its ovoid headlights, wraparound tail-lights, pronounced haunches, and wheels pushed as close to the car’s extremities as was reasonably possible.It’s a handsome thing that still has presence today.Less appealing was its technical make-up: it had an all-steel body and sat on an old Ford platform, which meant it tipped the scales at 1768kg, making it similar in weight to the considerably larger F-Pace.As such, when we first drove the E-Pace, we found it didn’t deliver the poise and finesse that we had come to expect from a Jaguar.It was inoffensive and by no means bad to drive, with its well-tuned steering shining through, but a brittle low-speed ride meant that it didn’t excel at balancing athleticism with comfort.Several diesel and petrol engines were offered in various tunes.Mild-hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains were added later when the E-Pace received a number of upgrades, the most notable being a switch to JLR’s PTA platform, which underpinned the second-generation Land Rover Discovery Sport and Range Rover Evoque of 2019.Both front- and four-wheel drive were available, while a smooth, ZF-supplied nine-speed automatic gearbox was standard on all cars.The 1.5-litre petrol fours and lesser 2.0-litre diesel fours were a bit sluggish, so we would suggest the 178bhp D180 as a used buy: it struck the best compromise between oomph and economy (expect around 50mpg).If you don’t do enough miles to justify a diesel, the 2.0-litre petrol four could be had with 197bhp, 247bhp or, later on, 296bhp. If you want to tow, the 237bhp D240 should be ideal.The 296bhp P300e plug-in hybrid, introduced in 2019, promised up to 34 miles of electric-only range and was a welcome addition for its punchy combination of petrol engine and electric motor.A used PHEV E-Pace will always be dearer than its pure-ICE counterpart, though, and you will need to have reliable access to a charger at home or work.Crucially, the E-Pace espoused the traditional luxury brand values of its F-Pace big brother inside, with plush leather seats, chrome trim and a neatly organised dashboard.A selection of cheaper plastics conspired to lessen the upmarket feel, but it still had rivals like the Volkswagen Tiguan licked for material quality.Opt for the later facelifted car if you want even more opulence and slicker technology (primarily a new touchscreen that’s larger and nicer to use).The E-Pace is also capacious for its size, being able to comfortably accommodate both children and adults in the rear, with the latter able to find a relaxing seating position thanks to generous rear head and leg room.Impressive interior quality and clever packaging are Jaguar hallmarks, of course, but they are likely to come at a much higher price in future as the brand remodels itself as a maker of ultra-luxury electric cars.A used E-Pace for £9000 seems like a bargain when you consider that direction of travel – and, now that it’s on the chopping block, should bring an air of exclusivity to your everyday commute.",

    "description": "Photography by: Zach Brehl (@zachbrehl) 1986 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole (QV) Location: Toronto, Ontario Country of original delivery: Canada Chassis/VIN: GLA12978 Mileage: 25,334 kms (15,742 miles) Certification : Polo Storico Certification Price: Call for Price     The Car | The 1st nut-and-bolt restoration undertaken by Lamborghini As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer this highly storied, two-owner, factory-restored, US-specification 1986 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole. Believed to be the first nut-and-bolt restoration project ever undertaken by Lamborghini, years before the creation of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015, this Countach LP5000 QV represents a unique chapter in Lamborghini history. This 1986 Countach Quattrovalvole, finished in Rosso over Champagne with a Brown dashboard, was originally delivered on April 17, 1986, to a dealership called Autolynn in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. It was equipped with fuel injection to comply with North American emissions regulations and featured USA-specific bumpers. In the summer of 1988, the car was owned by a real estate agent who, after an afternoon drive, parked it in his driveway. Later that day, smoke began to emanate from the engine bay, ultimately igniting a fire that damaged the engine, body panels, and interior, scorching the seats and causing significant smoke damage. Deemed a write-off by the insurance company due to the scarcity and cost of replacement parts, the car seemed destined for obscurity—until the current custodian, a Canadian collector with a deep passion for the Countach, entered the picture. The search for parts was arduous. “I called every Lamborghini dealer in North America, faxed lists, and made countless calls, only to be told that parts were unavailable or would take months to arrive,” the owner recounted. “The factory had shifted focus to the new Diablo, making Countach components nearly impossible to find.” Then, an unexpected call came from a Toronto lawyer representing Lamborghini. The company, aware of his search through multiple inquiries across North America, wanted to inspect the salvaged parts. By 1989, he shipped the car to Milan. Lamborghini’s sales manager, Ubaldo Sgarzi, responded within a week of the car's arrival, confirming receipt and outlining plans to prepare an estimate for the restoration. With the production line for the Countach already dismantled, many parts had to be handmade or specially ordered from original suppliers. The extensive project took two and a half years and cost over USD $240,000— $30,000 more than the price of a new Diablo at the time. “The documentation is immense,” says the owner. Invoices, receipts, and correspondence attest to what was essentially a full rebuild. This restoration stands as a landmark: the first comprehensive restoration carried out by Lamborghini itself, years before the establishment of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015.   Continue...",

Somehow, the leaf wraps its desiccated body around the windshield wiper arm. I can smell its dry, brittle scent. The smell of autumn. I suddenly had a thought. “Was that the last auto event for the season?” Rewind back 7 hours. Let's go back to the beginning. The event in mention is the annual 28 Liberty car show, hosted by Carpark in the financial district of Manhattan. Like many other Carpark events, organizers Rob Blackman, Jeffrey Einhorn, and Liz Gilchrist create a show that is as much a celebration of the cars as it is a gathering of people. In Jeff’s own words, ‘a three-dimensional event’. With food, wine, cars, and even a marching brass band, there aren’t many events that have the same milieu.

    "description": "Hyundai’s Creta iVT is a hot favourite of our long term fleet, and that’s down to how convenient and fuss-free a companion it is. Here to give a taste of another flavour of the Creta is the N Line. A 160hp turbo-petrol engine, dual-clutch transmission, and tweaked steering and suspension promise a more involving driving experience, something I, its custodian, have a good few months to make the most of. However, for me, this version of the Creta appeals first and foremost for the way it looks. Its larger 18-inch rims alone uplift the stance successfully, and then there’s the rest of the N Line trimmings. The sportier bumpers, side skirts, roof spoiler and red detailing add up to give the Creta N Line genuine visual distinction among the sea of ‘ordinary’ Cretas. The iVT looks plain vanilla when standing alongside. N Line-specific details add greatly to the look. I like what Hyundai has done with the interior, too. The all-black treatment with red highlights works to bring in some sportiness to the ambience. The N Line-specific steering is also great to hold, and even the metal finish to the pedals is a detail not lost on me. For the full effect, I’ve made the Sport screen (carbon-fibre look) the default layout for the digital instruments. I’m not entirely satisfied with my seating position though. The digital screen and centre touchscreen are positioned a touch low for my liking. Oh, and the absence of wireless connectivity for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto was an irritant during my initial days with the Creta. A Rs 99 wire did help get past the issue, but I’d rather not have my phone plugged in for more time than required. Crisp cameras and multiple views are a boon. Our N Line is in top-spec N10 form and the goodies on board are being put to, well, good use. Front seat ventilation is a hit with everyone who experiences it, and I like the sound from the Bose sound system. I’m no audiophile but there is enough depth to the sound to satisfy my ears. What I really appreciate are the cameras. The front view camera is very handy in judging parking space, and the blind view monitors are a boon, too. Camera resolution and performance are impressive and better than what you get in many pricier cars. Exhaust note should have been jazzed up for the N Line. We’re in the thick of the festive season as I file this report, which means traffic is at its yearly worst. Forget about letting the 160 horses under the hood loose, getting into fourth gear is an achievement on my daily commute these days. The stop/start driving means the dual-clutch gearbox has to work overtime, and it’s not particularly a fan of frequent shifts at low speeds. There’s the occasional delay and the odd jerky shift at other times. The Creta iVT offers a far smoother experience in the same environment. The N Line can be had with a 6-speed manual, too, but it’d be too committed a choice for my kind of driving. The other thing? The N Line’s larger 18-inch wheels also manifest in a busier ride. You feel more of the surface below, and it’s not quite as pliant as other Cretas on 17-inch rims. There’s more weight at the steering, too – great when you’re on a twisty road, not so much when you have a tight parking to work your car into. Low-speed city driving has taken its toll on economy. What’s also pinching a bit is fuel economy. I’ve been averaging all of 7.9kpl but my 10km round trip through choc-a-block traffic doesn’t let the engine have it easy at any point. The real-time figure improves dramatically (upwards of 10kpl) over late night drives on emptier roads. I would have liked more background music on said drives from the exhaust. The twin tip exhaust is just for show and sound levels are no higher than a regular Creta, which is a shame. I intend to end the year with a few weekend getaways, and the plan is to select routes with some good driving roads as well. I’ll keep you posted on my learnings on those. Initial impressions are of being with the best looking Creta, but not necessarily the best Creta per se.

    "description": "As with the older Tour-X4, Arai’s latest Adventure helmet is very versatile, in that it can also be configured as a road helmet without the peak or an MX-style helmet without the visor. However, it now addresses a universal complaint with the previous Tour-X4 – its visor change mechanism that needed the removal of four screws. The new one debuts a much easier system where the entire peak and visor can be removed by using just a small push tab under the covering plate. In typical Arai fashion, it’s a marvelously over-engineered solution that can be intimidating to use at first, but you quickly figure it out, and the system works well. Just ensure that the mechanism is properly clicked into place before you ride off!   The X5 gets a new Pinlock-compatible visor that has a more rounded profile with improved optics. One of the big changes here is the removal of the trademark eyebrow vents in the visor, which is a bit bittersweet. On the one hand, those vents definitely work well, but the flip side is that they tend to leak in continuous heavy rain, even when closed. The Tour-X5 also drops the chin vents on the sides of the helmet jaw. The total number of vents has reduced, but the actual venting is still superb, so I have no complaints.      I spent a week in this helmet at the GS Trophy, which was easily the most intense riding of my life, and the comfort was excellent. The best helmets are the ones that melt away into the background and let you focus on your riding, and this one manages just that.  The Tour-X5’s peak has also been redesigned, and I found that it had noticeably less lift at high speeds on an adventure bike. It also feels much better on naked bikes, with negligible lift at a steady 100kph. However, the tradeoff is that wind noise is quite high, so it’s best to use this helmet on a bike with good wind protection.    The Tour-X5 has a weight similar to the Tour-X4   Weighing 1,650 grams, it is more or less the same as the T4, but like the old helmet, it feels superbly balanced and great for all-day usage. Another really appreciable change is that Arai knows almost all its customers will install a Bluetooth communicator, so they’ve made it easier to do so. The cheek pads now have dedicated circular Velcro extensions for your speakers, and there are even small wire-managing tabs built into the liner. This is definitely the nicest helmet I’ve used for installing/removing a comms device, and it’ll be great to see other Arai models get a similar treatment.    It has convenient cut-outs for speakers   The helmet is now ECE 22-06-compliant, and quality is at a typically high level with a beautiful paint finish, the most luxurious inner liner material you’ll ever come across and a solid, built-to-last feel in every component. As always, this helmet is an investment in a top-quality handmade product, and the prices match that. They currently start at a little under Rs 60,000 for plain colours in Europe and go up for graphics. You will save a significant amount if you shop from some Asian markets, but be aware that Arai’s shell shapes and sizes are different in these markets, so it’s crucial to try before you buy.    Where: araihelmet.eu   Price: Rs 64,000 (approx.)   Also see: Arai Tour-X4 helmet review",

    "description": "Kia has announced that its upcoming compact SUV will be called the Syros. Internally codenamed the AY, the Kia Syros is expected to debut globally in the coming weeks with a launch likely slated for early next year. Kia Syros will have a design inspired by EV9 and Carnival Will have a more premium positioning than the Sonet Will likely be offered with both ICE and electric powertrains Kia compact SUV named Syros and not Clavis: here’s why Sources tell us that Kia had initially considered the name Clavis for the compact SUV, but dropped it later as the Carens and Carnival MPVs start with a 'C'. Since the Syros is being marketed as a 'compact SUV', the brand chose to stick to its current nomenclature of naming its SUVs with an 'S' like the Seltos and Sonet. Kia Syros to focus on rear seat comfort As we've reported earlier, the new Syros will differentiate itself from other compact SUVs by having a greater focus on rear-seat space and comfort. It features a boxy design with a flat roof and upright rear, in order to liberate maximum cabin space. There are talks of the Syros having more interior room than the Sonet, and in a league similar to the Seltos. Kia Syros powertrain options  There are no details on the powertrain front yet, but sources have previously said it will get both ICE and electric powertrain options. Kia will likely launch it with the internal combustion engines first, and the EV version will arrive later. Both versions will be based on the same platform and will be offered in front wheel drive guise. The upcoming compact SUV will be positioned above the existing crop of the sub-4m SUVs, like the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Maruti Brezza, and also the recently launched Skoda Kylaq.    Also See: 2024 Kia Carnival review: Manners make the van New Kia Carnival sold out for nearly a year in India",

    "description": "Mahindra will take the wraps off the production-spec BE 6e and XEV 9e electric SUVs on November 26. The brand has now previewed the interior of both models via some teasers. Both SUVs will have a 5-seater configuration  Will be introduced at different price points XEV 9e shares some interior bits with the XUV700 Mahindra BE 6e to get twin-screen layout The new teaser pretty much confirms what was seen in previous spy shots – the interior layout of the BE 6e seems quite futuristic and techy. It comes with dual 12.3-inch screens and a ‘halo’ or a floating wraparound element that extends from the dashboard to the centre console creating a cockpit-like, driver-centric environment. It also gets a twin-spoke steering wheel with an illuminated Mahindra BE logo. The teaser also shows a large glass roof, an electronic parking brake, drive modes and a few other features. Mahindra XEV 9e triple-screen setup confirmed The XEV 9e will be bigger than the BE 6e SUV and have a completely unique dashboard design. The electric coupe-SUV goes a step ahead of the BE 6e in terms of the number of screens with a unique triple-screen setup. We can confirm that it gets three individual 12.3-inch units with a 1920x720 resoluton running Mahindra’s Adrenox software. The electric SUV will also come with a two-spoke flat-bottom steering wheel with an illuminated logo. Apart from this, the XEV 9e is expected to carry over some switchgear from the XUV700, such as the HVAC and the centre console controls. The SUV will get an electric parking brake and drive modes, among other bits. Upcoming Mahindra electric SUVs: what will they rival? While the BE 6e electric SUV will have a unique styling inside and out, it will be aimed squarely at the the BYD Atto 3 and the MG ZS EV, and the upcoming Creta EV and Maruti e Vitara. On the other hand, the larger XEV 9e will be pitted against the more practical Tata Harrier EV that is expected to go on sale sometime next year.
