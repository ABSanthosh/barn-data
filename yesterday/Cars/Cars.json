    "description": "Explosive performance at an accessible price – these words instantly bring a certain orange machine to mind. Since 2013, the KTM 390 Duke has dominated its class, and every single rival that has gone up against the Duke has retreated with its tail tucked between its legs. But today, the Duke will have to deal with its toughest challenge yet posed by the Aprilia Tuono 457. KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 design and ergonomics Both have sharp designs and can feel tight for taller folks With some bikes, just a glance is enough to tell you what they are meant to do, and the designs of these two machines are true to their function. Neither is classically good-looking, and both are aggressively styled, although in its latest avatar, the 390 might be too aggressive for some.  The rider’s triangle is the first difference you’ll notice, and while both are reasonably comfortable, on the Aprilia, there is a bit of a forward reach to the handlebar, whereas you’re almost bolt upright on the KTM. Over bad roads, this will be felt in the lower back. With their 800mm perches, these bikes will be welcoming for shorter riders but feel cramped for taller ones.  Both bikes are a little tight for larger and heavier riders. At 5’11”, I just about fit on both these machines, but taller riders should look elsewhere. The Duke can be had with an accessory tall seat, raising its perch to 820mm, which will liberate some knee room for taller riders. The optional comfort seat on the Tuono keeps the same height as the stock unit. Neither is geared toward all-out comfort, and that’s par for the course.  KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 quality and features Duke has larger number of useful features and better quality all across Modern-day KTMs have made huge strides when it comes to the quality front, and that is clearly visible here. The Tuono 457, with its aluminium chassis, looks great, but crucial areas, such as the cheap-feeling key, the more basic levers and an ugly misaligned panel on the headlight surround, just feel like a step down from the KTM. Fun fact: the adjustable brake lever on the Tuono is a Rs 5,500 accessory (!) and appears to be the exact same unit as the one on the Gen 2 390 Duke that sells for under Rs 1,000. The 390 Duke now also gets cruise control. Another facet where the Duke is ahead of the Tuono is the features (and bragging rights) department. Its suspension has damping adjustability, the bidirectional quickshifter is standard, it comes with a cornering anti-lock braking system (ABS) and traction control (TC), and the latest model even has cruise control. The Tuono, with its three riding modes, switchable ABS and TC and preload-adjustable front suspension, has a good level of kit, unlike the contender from the tuning fork brand. As for the Aprilia’s bidirectional quickshifter? A cool Rs 20,000 for that.  KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 handling Both are superb handlers and will put a big smile on your face However, you don’t ride a bike’s build quality or features, so I’ll stop rambling about that and start raving about how these things behave on the road. Both take very different approaches to their chassis – the KTM uses a steel trellis, while the Aprilia has an aluminium perimeter frame (the only one in this class to do so). Predictably, their behaviour on the side of the tyre is markedly different, but both are almost equally fast in the real world.  Both machines are fast, but they go about their business quite differently. It might sound cliché, but the Duke feels a lot like a supermoto, and the Tuono feels a lot like a sportbike with a taller handlebar in the corners. They handle with a different feeling: the Duke prioritises lightness and reactivity, while the Aprilia feels agile but also beautifully composed. That said, both handle very well, and you’ll have a great time on either machine, whether on road or track.  Key specificationsAprilia Tuono 457KTM 390 DukeKerb Weight175kg168.3kgSeat height800mm800mmGround clearance 150mm170mmFuel tank capacity12.7 litres15 litresWheelbase1360mm1357mm KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 ride comfort Duke's suspension more pliant; Tuono's brake fade issue an annoyance While chasing twisty ribbons of tarmac is what owners will dream of doing with these bikes, the reality is they will be used for commuting more often. Mumbai’s lumpy roads are a proper test of a bike’s suspension, and here, the Duke’s sophisticated setup will be worth its weight in gold. The bike feels a lot more absorptive while going over bumps, without sacrificing poise when you turn up the wick.   Both have taut suspension setups but KTM feels much more pliant than the Aprilia. In comparison, the Tuono’s suspension system, carried over unchanged from the RS 457, feels much stiffer, and you will feel more of the bumps. The brake-fade issue under repeated hard use on the 457s is another sore point, and while it isn’t a very difficult fix, Aprilia should’ve ironed it out by now. Especially since customers have shared that certain dealerships say warranties will be cancelled when brake master cylinders are upgraded.  EngineAprilia Tuono 457KTM 390 DukeEngine457cc, twin-cyl, liquid-cooled399cc, single-cyl, liquid-cooledPower47.6hp at 9,400rpm46hp at 8,500rpmPower-to-weight ratio272hp/tonne273.33hp/tonneTorque43.5Nm at 6,400rpm39Nm at 6,400rpm KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 engine and performance Aprilia's engine is the star of the show, KTM is quick but not as characterful So far, it’s neck and neck, but one area where the Tuono scores a massive victory is the engine. The twin-cylinder mill is smooth, brimming with character, and makes all the right sounds. Its strong low-end and mid-range also mean you needn’t frantically work the gearbox, and it also pops nice power wheelies. In outright performance, the Tuono is quicker in the 0-100kph sprint by just 0.3 seconds, but its engine’s effortless grunt is more apparent in the roll-on acceleration tests.  The Tuono’s engine is a peach. Hopping onto the KTM after the Aprilia will make you realise you need to work the gearbox more and give the engine revs to make quick progress. You’ll also feel a more pronounced buzz, especially in the handlebar. However, the Duke’s refinement levels are respectable for a single-cylinder engine of this size with this level of performance. That said, the excitable hooligan nature of the KTM is great fun, if that’s the riding experience you’re after.  PerformanceAprilia Tuono 457KTM 390 DukeAcceleration 0-60kph2.17s2.21s0-100kph4.88s5.21sRoll-on acceleration20-50kph1.73s1.87s30-70kph2.83s3.19s50-80kph2.68s3.22sBraking60-0kph (in metres)16.3516.52 KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 price and verdict Tuono is an impressive machine let down by pressing issues PriceAprilia Tuono 457KTM 390 DukePrice (ex-showroom, Delhi)Rs 3.95 lakhRs 2.97 lakh All that back and forth now means I need to tell you which bike is the winner. The Tuono 457 feels very special to ride, but it’s nearly Rs 1.50 lakh more (on-road, Mumbai) with the accessory quickshifter installed. The engine and sublime handling are two very big factors to get one, and this motorcycle won’t be as common a sight on our roads as the Duke. There are buyers out there for whom the extra Rs 1.5 lakh will be justified because the Tuono feels like a scaled-down big bike, which is a very special feeling.  Brake-fade issue continues on Aprilia 457s. However, in the last couple of months, several customers have reported varied and significant engine reliability issues. Aprilia India recently attributed these issues to unauthorised modifications and/or irregular service and says that it has addressed the few genuine cases. Whether the issues are fully addressed is something only time can tell.  Beyond that, there is no escaping the fact that the 390 Duke has a much more accessible price, more features and better ride comfort, and it can be nearly as fast as the Tuono. There were some isolated engine incidents at the beginning, but Bajaj swiftly addressed them, and the bike has been around for long enough that there are no significant reliability concerns. All this is why the KTM 390 Duke will continue to reign in this segment. Also See: KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 comparison video",

    "description": "Some motorcycles have a tendency to slip under the average buyer’s radar, and the Suzuki GSX-8R is a fine example. It probably won’t be the first pick when you ask someone to think of a middleweight sportbike, and that’s fair because this bike packs a parallel-twin engine in a segment with more powerful inline-3 and 4-cylinder motors. But unassuming things can often surprise you with how good they can be, and that’s exactly what the 8R did at our annual track day a couple of months back. Not only did it set the quickest lap time (to be fair, it was also the most powerful bike there), but it also proved to be surprisingly sweet and engaging to ride. Suzuki GSX8R engine sound and performance - 8/10 Twin-cyl motor is torquey and smooth but isn't the most exciting nor the best sounding in its class As it turns out, this character translates beautifully to the street as well. While the 776cc parallel twin produces the least power in this segment, the torque figure is actually the highest. Its 78Nm is, in fact, much closer to the Triumph Street Triple 765 RS than it is to the Daytona 660, which is this bike’s immediate rival. That results in a wonderfully strong pull from as low as 3,000rpm, and effortless performance is the name of the game.   The 776cc parallel twin is a good engine, but it lacks the sound and top-end excitement you’ll find with rivals that have 3- or 4-cylinder motors. Switching between the three riding modes lets you experience a very mellow throttle response in C mode or a sharp, quick-throttle feel in A mode, where the torque hit arrives with a solid kick. I found that B mode offers a nice middle ground between the two, but regardless of which you choose, the 8R will propel you to triple-digit speeds with complete ease and no need for dramatic high revs.  That’s not to say that this is a slow motorcycle, and with 82hp, it will blast past 150kph the way most quick Indian bikes would get to 100. But there’s also no discounting the fact that it has sacrificed some of the exciting, zingy top-end performance of its multi-cylinder rivals in exchange for the low-end usability. However, the bigger loss for many enthusiasts will be the sound or relative lack of it. It doesn't sound as nice nor has the same top-end rush as its multi-cylindered rivals. This is a 270-degree parallel twin, and it does have that typically deep and rumbling sound, but it’s also quite muted and not very exciting. For reference, Aprilia’s new 457 parallel twin sounds a lot louder and more thrilling, as we discovered when the Suzuki and the Tuono 457 were parked side by side on our track day. If you’re someone who wants a loud and flashy sportbike, this won’t be for you. EngineSuzuki GSX-8REngine776cc, twin-cylinder, liquid-cooledPower82hp at 8500rpm Torque78Nm at 6800rpmGearbox 6-speed Suzuki GSX8R ride and handling - 8/10  It is poised when going through a corner yet comfortable over broken roads But a subtle nature doesn’t mean an unimpressive one because this bike is surprisingly good fun to ride. On the track, it proved to be easy, unintimidating and thoroughly well-behaved, responding obediently to your every request. This clearly isn’t a bike made for the racetrack, but it performed there far better than most would expect. The only limiting factors for Rajini when he was pushing for a fast lap were that the footpegs were scraping and that the ABS was too intrusive. Comfort is aided by a wide and accommodating rider seat. On the street, neither of those ended up being an issue, but the bike retained that sweet and friendly feel. At 205kg, the 8R is in the ballpark for the segment, and you will feel the weight if you plan to go attacking some very tight and twisty interior roads. But give the bike some breathing room on a wider road, and you’ll discover a rewarding handler that settles into a wonderful flow with the road.  Tall clip-on bars result in a reasonably comfy riding position. The 8R feels settled on its suspension and encourages you to push to quite a high pace. Part of this deep-seated sense of confidence comes through the tubular steel chassis and the non-adjustable but well-set Showa suspension. It’s not excessively plush like the Daytona 660, which means it isn’t as comfy on badly made concrete roads (although it really isn’t bad and is far from punishing), but you reap the rewards when the pace is raised on a good stretch of tarmac.  Key SpecsSuzuki GSX-8RKerb Weight205kgSeat Height810mmFuel Capacity14 litresGround Clearance145mmWheelbase1465mm Suzuki GSX8R comfort, build quality and features - 8/10 Well-built, comfortable and has everything you need, can drink fuel quite quickly if you ride it hard   On the other hand, the riding position is committed enough to remind you that you’re on a fair, sporty motorcycle but also relatively kind on the wrists, hips and knees. It’s a similar story with the brakes. The initial bite is almost disappointing, but once you start using them for a while, you realise there’s sufficient power and feel, and it matches the nature of the bike. Brakes feel dull at first but work well. I also like how Suzuki has given its 5-inch TFT display a simple, easy-to-use layout. You almost never have to enter any menus. All the functions you’d need, like changing the ride modes, the TC levels (four, including off), or just switching between trip information, can be done from the main home screen display. Overall quality levels are also very nice, and like most imported Japanese bikes, everything feels solid and has a pleasing, built-to-last feel. TFT display has a clean layout and is very easy to use. There aren’t many outright negatives, and the few complaints are that the bike gets quite hot in heavy traffic – there are no nasty hot air blasts, but there is quite a bit of radiated heat that you need to deal with. What I found to be more of an issue was that it seems to empty its 14-litre tank quite quickly, and you won’t go much further than 150-170km on a tankful if you have a throttle-happy right wrist.   A subtle nature doesn’t mean an unimpressive one, and the 8R is surprisingly good fun. Suzuki GSX8R price and verdict - 8/10 It is the most affordable and least flashy machine in its class At Rs 9.25 lakh, ex-showroom, the GSX-8R costs about Rs 50,000 less than the Daytona and Rs 75,000 less than Honda’s revered CBR650R. The price savings are nice but not big enough to be a reason to pick this bike over those two. For that, I’d say that this is the thinking person’s middleweight sportbike – the bike for someone who likes flying under the radar.  The 8R is a lovely but understated machine, which won't make it stand out in its class. And with that in mind, Suzuki may have a bit of a tough time on their hands. That’s because this is the segment where someone is typically buying their first sportbike, and subtlety is usually not at the top of the wish list. But for those who want that more understated experience, the GSX-8R is a great choice.  Also See: Suzuki GSX8R video review",

    "description": "Don’t let the ‘Sport’ in its name mislead you; what makes this Range Rover quick is the little SV badge instead, though that also needs some clarification. You see, per JLR, SV cars in the JLR-verse are the ‘exquisite interpretations by Special Vehicle Operations’. So, while on the Range Rover, SV denotes ‘even more luxury’, on the Range Rover Sport, it signals ‘the fastest Range Rover of all time’. SV on the Range Rover Sport signals the fastest Range Rover of all time.  Indeed, powered by JLR’s BMW-sourced 4.4-litre twin-turbo petrol V8, tuned here to 635hp, this Range Rover Sport SV does the 0 to 100kph dash in a claimed 3.8 seconds and tops out at an impressive 290kph. So, while it’s got some off-road chops, it’s quite a different take from its regular off-roading siblings, and we got a day to experience it in the UK. Range Rover Sport SV Performance and Refinement: 8/10 The breadth of the powertrain’s character transformation is impressive Engage SV mode via the illuminated button positioned towards the base of the steering wheel, and the Sport SV preps the entire car, chassis, engine and all for a performance level beyond the regular Dynamic mode. Ride height drops by another 15mm, and torque bumps up 50Nm to 800Nm with the Dynamic launch mode. Range Rover Sport SV specsEngine Mild-hybrid, twin-turbo V8Displacement 4395ccPower635hpTorque 750Nm (800Nm with dynamic launch mode)Gearbox8-speed AT Drive layout All-wheel drive 0-100kph (claimed)3.8 seconds Top-speed (claimed) 290kph And boy, it is quick. I floor it in manual mode first and hit the redline in first and second gears before I can tug at the paddle. Cog swaps need to be supercar-style quick, and after telling my brain that, I get the full-bore launch – what a rush that is. Power delivery is thick and fast, and it revs freely past 7,000rpm; the acceleration feels nice and raw with sharp and quick gearshifts, quite uncharacteristically for a planetary torque converter autobox and quite a transformation from the unit’s daily driver abilities that it does just fine, too. Sport SV's straight-line speed and the engine’s flexible character are a delight.  What’s nice is there’s a neat soundtrack as well; perhaps some of the engine note is piped in through the speakers. But I’m not complaining; the gurgle from the exhausts is something we may soon not hear at all. Dynamic mode dials things down from wild to energetic. And left in Auto mode, the Sport SV is quite the relaxed town cruiser. Range Rover Sport SV Ride Comfort and Handling: 7/10 Can hold its own around corners but isn’t what you could call agile With all that propulsion, keeping a two-and-a-half-tonne SUV on the road is tricky business, so JLR has thrown a lot in terms of chassis systems. There’s all-wheel drive, all-wheel steering, torque vectoring by braking, an active rear locking differential and a setup that the company calls 6D Dynamics, a system that combines hydraulically linked dampers and height-adjustable air springs. Not light on its feet but hydraulically linked dampers help keep things sane around corners.  The semi-active 6D system does away with the need for anti-roll bars, and instead, the hydraulically linked dampers pump fluid between each other to keep roll and pitch in check. It does work to an extent; cornering around some twisty British B and C roads, the Sport SV feels composed, but it’s never agile or light on its feet like a Porsche Cayenne, for instance. Ride quality is firm, and you can easily feel every rut and crack from the road surface. Move out of SV mode, and things improve, but even at its most plush setting, there is a sharp edge to the ride. 23-inch carbon-fibre wheels look neat but lend a firm edge to ride quality. No doubt the 23-inch carbon fibre rims with the slim Michelin Pilot Sport All Season tyres do no favours. The steering weight is fine and changes with the drive mode, but it lacks an incisive feel to it. Braking performance is just fine, and the optional carbon-ceramic disc did a good job hauling this massive brute down from high speeds. Range Rover Sport SV Mileage: 6/10 The combined WLTP fuel efficiency rating for the Sport SV is 8kpl It might have mild hybrid tech, but with its weight and performance tuning, don’t expect the SV’s kilometre per litre figure to be in two digits. The official WLTP rating for the Range Rover Sport SV’s fuel efficiency is 8kpl. Range Rover Sport SV Exterior Design and Engineering: 8/10 The SV does not shout sport in your face but has enough presence to draw attention Range Rover Sport SV dimensionsLength 4970mm Width2209mm Height 1814mm Wheelbase 2998mm Kerb weight 2560kg Tyres (F, R)285/40 R23, 305/35 R23 Now in its third generation, the Sport moves to a new platform: JLR’s MLA-Flex, which gives it multiple powertrain options, including full electric due later. The exterior, though, features familiar styling cues as its predecessor; it’s just a bit sleeker and meaner – for instance, the grille, the headlights and the glasshouse area are slimmer, giving the car a sportier look. SV variant gets a healthy splash of carbon fibre trim all around.  The SV version, which is dialled up further, has broader air intakes at the bumper’s edges, reprofiled lower sides and functional quad-exit tailpipes. And, of course, there’s plenty of carbon fibre: from the aforementioned 23-inch rims to trim bits around the tailpipes, as well as for the front bumper slats, grille, and hood and side vents. There’s also the option of a carbon-fibre hood. Then there are vivid colours for the body and brake calipers, too, that you can also spec. All in all, to these eyes at least, the SV does the sport look just right, not too much but not too little either. Range Rover Sport SV Space and Comfort: 7/10 Spacious insides are more luxurious than outright sporty The insides look luxurious with a minimalistic styling theme, though it’s almost to the point of being quite bland, especially so for those who like things blinged-up. The dashboard is presented as a large, clean surface upon which a 13.1-inch touchscreen is placed. The central console, too, has its cubbies closed off and just a small stubby gear lever sticking out. Being the SV, there are some sporty bits like illuminated SV logos on the backrests and edge-illuminated paddle shifters, but on the whole, the interior does not scream sport. The cabin is classy, but some will find the minimalistic style bland. The SV also debuts JLR’s new ‘body and soul seats’ (BASS), which, as the acronym suggests, generate audio vibrations corresponding to the media played on the 29-speaker Meridian sound system. Available on the front seats only, there are also six different soundscapes – designed in collaboration with the National Transport Design Centre at Coventry University and the School of Media and Performing Arts – that combine sound and vibrations to relax or energise you. It’s hard to accurately describe the feeling, but it’s somewhere between a massage and a vibrating seat. Speaking of the seats, I found the lumbar a touch extra, but seating space both at the front and rear is ample enough. Range Rover Sport SV Features and Safety: 8/10 The Sport SV Edition Two trim comes well equipped The car we had in the UK was the ‘Edition Two’ spec, which meant it was well-equipped with bits like digital LED headlights, illuminated metal treadplates, 4-zone climate control, a 13.1-inch touchscreen, Meridian signature sound, 3D surround cameras, remote park assist, HUD, and heated ventilated and reclining seats at the front and rear. As for safety equipment, it has six airbags and a full ADAS suite, which works just fine on UK roads. Range Rover Sport SV Price and Verdict: 8/10 The Sport SV is certainly the most capable all-rounder in the JLR fleet Super SUVs of today are remarkable feats of engineering that have to deliver on diverse fronts: they have to be large and spacious like family SUVs, comfy like luxury sedans and quick like sports cars. So, they come at a price; in this one’s case, that’s Rs 2.95 crore ex-showroom, India. It’s a lot, but no more – in fact, exactly the same – as the Audi RS Q8 Performance, and in that aspect, it’s a fair ask. It’s the Sport SV’s breadth of talents that is truly impressive. It’s wanting in some places for sure. Like around corners, it’s not very agile, and ride quality, too, is not as pliant as some rivals. But while it cedes ground on dynamics, it gains in many areas. The interior, for example, is spacious and comfy, with a luxurious and classy feel. Outside, the styling is sleek and sporty, with a nice, elegant flair to it, and then, given its family lineage, the Range Rover Sport SV also has some off-roading chops baked into its DNA – 23-inch rims notwithstanding – and, in the end, that’s where its appeal lies. It’s the most capable all-rounder in the JLR portfolio and, against rivals, has a truly wide set of talents.

    "description": "Dear reader, I’m overjoyed to announce I’ve recently become a dad. Life has changed in so many ways (I’ve never valued a power nap as much as I do now!), and to an extent, so has the way I look at cars. I have become ever more mindful of the smallest of things that could make my little one’s car rides comfier. ISOFIX child seat anchors are a bit tough to find underneath the seat cushioning. Of course, step one was to get the child seat in order. The Hyundai Creta N Line I’ve been using gets ISOFIX child seat anchors to lock the seat firmly in place, but they’re tucked behind the cushioning and need a bit of poking around to locate. This is not a biggie for an average user who’d keep the seat in place for months at a stretch, but I have to keep removing and re-attaching the seat whenever there’s a new car I have to test. Thankfully, my daughter has taken well to the car seat and, as my wife reports from the back seat, enjoys her drives. Option to pre-cool the Creta using the phone app put to full use over the summer. We’ve had a baking summer in Mumbai, and my kiddo, understandably, hates being strapped onto her seat in a hot car. The solution has come in the form of remote pre-cooling. To be honest, I’d never used connected car features beyond a review evaluation, but today, setting up the car in advance with the tap of a few buttons on my phone screen is part of my SOP. The option to remotely start the vehicle and have the air conditioning run has been an absolute boon. Hyundai’s BlueLink app is easy to use, and I’ve not had challenges with the network, which is known to be an issue with many eSIM-based connected services. Our kiddo loves looking through the panoramic sunroof. Of course, we’ve had our share of crying spells on the go. Bumper-to-bumper traffic with an irate baby is not fun, I can tell you that. On one such drive, retracting the cover for the panoramic sunroof proved to be an Eureka moment. The newfound view of the world above immediately distracted my daughter, making the remainder of the journey a lot, well, calmer. Something tells me kids will love the Mahindra BE 6 and XEV 9e’s trippy, colour-changing roof lighting. The Creta N Line, in general, has proved to be good transport for the family, but I do wish there was more luggage room. I never realised a stroller occupied so much space! Fuel economy figure firmly in the single digits in chock-a-block city driving. More efficiency would be welcome, too. Fuel economy has been in the 7-8kpl range, but to be fair, my bumper-to-bumper slog never gives cars a chance to breathe free. Of the other things, there’s an irritating plasticky creak from the centre console every time a driver’s leg presses against it. This is something we experienced on our Creta IVT, too. Centre console lets out creaks whenever the driver’s leg rests on it. I have ambitious plans for a road trip over the monsoons. It’ll be a full house with my wife, baby, doggo and myself in the car. Time to dig deeper into the Creta’s box of tricks!

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mini/hatchback-2014-2024",
    "description": "Mk3 Mini mellows in middle age, but does it still have enough old school charm to make it a canny used buy? With the option of five doors, a pure-electric version and a cleverly packaged platform that maximises interior space, the Mk3 Mini is a charismatic crowd-pleaser. It is a few centimetres bigger than its predecessor yet still retains all the old-school qualities of agility and compactness that we love in its forebears. And now the new ‘F66’ generation is becoming a common sight after its launch last year, prices for the previous-generation model have tumbled to as low as £2000.Of course, it’s not as compact as its 1960s namesake, but the F56-gen Mini is ergonomically stronger than its predecessors and has a roomier cabin and boot. Bolstering its appeal is an interior dripping with retro character, greater perceived quality and intuitive technology.Rear accommodation is still tight, but the five-door version is better and two extra openings make the world of difference. It’s just as refined as the Audi A1 and of a higher quality than the Ford Fiesta.High levels of grip give you the confidence to chuck it into bends like you’re escaping Turin with the Carabinieri on your tail, and the compliant ride means all the gold you’ve stashed in the boot won’t bang around – especially in cars fitted with the optional adaptive dampers (pretty rare these days).The nippy Mini One, with its 101bhp 1.2-litre turbocharged three-cylinder petrol, is ideal for urban commuters, but we would aim for the 1.5-litre Cooper, with its more sprightly 134bhp turbo petrol three-pot. It’s the better all-rounder and more entertaining to drive.The hot Cooper S dials the driving experience up another notch thanks to its 189bhp 2.0-litre twin-turbo four-cylinder petrol engine. “The most complete affordable fast hatch you can buy” is how we described the Cooper S when we pitted it against its closest rivals.While it’s firmer than its Cooper range-mate, its punchier motor and balanced chassis make it a fine companion for a brisk B-road jaunt.Performance enthusiasts might be tempted by the John Cooper Works (JCW) for its 228bhp and trick suspension tune, which adds upgraded springs and dampers, anti-roll bars and a lightened multi-link rear set-up.It’s excellent fun to drive but a bit stiff-legged and you’re unlikely to need the extra grunt – plus an immaculate 55,000-mile JCW will cost you £5000 more than an equivalent Cooper S.If you frequently cover big miles, you might be inclined to buy a diesel Mini, such as the 95bhp One D and 115bhp Cooper D. They cost only £20 to tax and will easily achieve a real-world 50mpg. That said, the Cooper SD, with its 168bhp, 266lb ft 2.0-litre BMW turbo diesel, is a bit more refined and no less economical.As for the Mini Electric, we would think twice before buying one. It’s fun, and ideal for short hops around town, but it has a real-world range of only 100-110 miles and that drops to about 80 miles in winter.When it comes to trims, the entry-level One is pretty basic inside so aim for at least a Cooper – and find a car with the larger, more intuitive 8.8in infotainment screen.The F56 was facelifted in 2018, which added new trims, headlights, quirky Union Jack tail-lights and smartphone mirroring as standard. More changes came in 2021, with a new front grille, interior technology and revised trims.But we would keep things simple and aim for a mid-2010s Cooper S. With a healthy budget of £8000, you can pick up a pristine 50,000- to 60,000-mile example and enjoy it all year round.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/technology/inside-renaults-radical-laboratory-wheels",
    "description": "Renault's laboratory on wheels is a rolling study of how to achieve small percentage gains Renault is treating its Emblème concept as a “laboratory on wheels for low-carbon mobility”. Revealed at the Paris show in October last year, it is claimed to emit the CO2 equivalent of 90% less greenhouse gas than a 2019 petrol Captur, based on a whole life-cycle analysis. The 4.8m-long estate is planned as a dual-energy EV with a battery and a range-extending hydrogen fuel cell system to keep it topped up if necessary. More than a concept, it’s become a rolling study of how best to get small percentage gains in carbon footprint reduction by scrutinising the basics such as aerodynamics, weight and materials used in every detail of the car. Seven materials and components account for 90% of its total carbon footprint and these are the battery, steel, aluminium, polymers, electronic components, tyres and hydrogen fuel cell system, which includes the fuel cell stack, the hydrogen storage tank and the systems that go with them. More than 20 partners worked with Renault and its EV division, Ampere, to achieve a 70% reduction in the carbon footprint of parts production by analysing components and materials on an individual basis. The OPmobility hydrogen fuel tank is made from carbon fibre, an industry-standard material for them, but uses low-carbon energy for the manufacturing process. Carbon emissions for the Verkor high-voltage battery are claimed to have been cut by 72% compared with a “traditional equivalent battery”. The precise details of what the battery composition will be when the Emblème goes into production isn’t yet clear, although Renault has told Autocar the battery will be capable of very high-speed charging. The more conventional aspects of the car’s construction include the use of advanced high-strength steels (AHSS) and press-hardenable steels (PHS) developed by ArcelorMittal, which reduce the weight of the body-in-white by 8%. Steels in the B-pillar consist of 75% recycled material produced with renewable electricity, giving an equivalent reduction in CO2 of 69%. The use of recycled aluminium for body panels is well established in the car industry and in this case requires only 5% of the energy compared with the primary material. It can also be recycled indefinitely without deteriorating. Less obvious areas under scrutiny include the interior, where Forvia’s natural materials such as linen and pineapple, used for coverings, act as carbon sinks by absorbing CO2 when growing. Whole-life CO2 equivalent emissions have been halved in the headlights designed by Forvia Hella and adaptive interior lighting reduces energy consumption by 60% around town.",

    "link": "https://www.bikeexif.com/2006-triumph-scrambler",
    "description": "Motorcycle tech has evolved exponentially over the past two decades—making today’s bikes easier to ride, but harder to customize. Complex wiring harnesses are a nightmare to navigate, and CAN bus systems limit what you can unplug without risking a bricked ECU. Luckily, the 2006 Triumph Scrambler sidesteps these modern afflictions. Triumph’s current crop of modern classics are liquid-cooled, ride-by-wire machines with rider aids and TFT screens. The older Triumph Scrambler is delightfully simple by comparison. You get a torquey, air-cooled parallel-twin, fed by twin carbs… and not much else. That makes it a fantastic base for stylish custom builds—like this Triumph Scrambler from Taiwan’s 2LOUD Custom. Known for blending eclectic flair with refined craftsmanship, 2LOUD’s approach suits the Scrambler perfectly.…",

    "description": "Skoda and Volkswagen join the list of carmakers in India that are planning to launch hybrid cars in the country. The European brands are working on strong hybrid midsize SUVs and sedans that are likely to launch by 2028. Skoda and Volkswagen hybrids to be based on new localised platform New platform an evolution of the VW Group’s CMP architecture Skoda-Volkswagen hybrid cars to be based on IMP21 platform CMP designed to support ICE, strong hybrid and electric powertrains. The hybrid SUVs and sedans from Volkswagen and Skoda will be underpinned by the IMP21 platform. As we’ve reported earlier, the IMP (India Main Platform) is a derivative of the CMP (China Main Platform), with strong localised elements to cater to the domestic cost structure and regulations. The CMP architecture is designed to support ICE, strong hybrid and electric powertrains. This shift to hybrids in Skoda Auto Volkswagen India’s plans reflects the group’s growing alignment with India’s regulatory trajectory and rising demand for fuel-efficient alternatives. The new hybrid models are a part of a broader compliance strategy to meet CAFE 3 norms, along with the group’s long-term electrification goals. While specifics remain under evaluation, the IMP21 architecture gives the group the flexibility to localise and scale hybrid options – should market conditions and policy incentives align. VW, Skoda hybrid rivals Hyundai, Kia, Renault and Nissan are all launching hybrid midsize SUVs in the coming years. Skoda and Volkswagen's midsize hybrid SUV will find rivals in upcoming models like the third-gen Hyundai Creta, second-gen Kia Seltos, new Renault Duster and Nissan's competitor, all of which will get a strong-hybrid powertrain option. At the moment, only Maruti Suzuki and Toyota offer hybrid midsize SUVs – the Grand Vitara and Hyryder, respectively. Meanwhile, Skoda and VW's hybrid sedans will face off against the Honda City e:HEV.
