    "description": "Spending a prolonged duration of time with a vehicle really brings out the nuances of living with it and paints a more detailed picture of how it will fit into your life. In that regard, the Rizta has fared wonderfully well, but over the past two months, one recurring electronic issue has been dampening its otherwise trouble-free experience. But since I’m the sort to sometimes have my dessert before dinner, we’ll start with the good points.  The first thing is that the charger now comes with an elastic cable that latches into place. Where that helps is that you don’t have the charger’s wires strewn about everywhere any time you need to put something in the boot. It may seem small, but it allows you to neatly store your charger and free up more usable space inside the boot for your other belongings.  Neat little elastic strap locks the charger’s wires into place, making storing it in the boot an easier and neater process. Another neat little touch is the small storage cubby just aft of the big 34-litre boot, where I routinely store my phone, keys and a soft microfibre cloth, which is used every so often to clean the Rizta (blame Mumbai’s incessant construction, road works and the dust they kick up!). Keeping your knick-knacks in this smaller area keeps them from getting tossed about inside the big boot on our woefully bouncy roads, something that is especially useful for our expensive modern electronic devices.  Small cubby allows you to securely store small personal items; it’s especially helpful for modern electronic devices. What puzzles me is that Ather hasn’t given the Rizta an external storage cubby, as I’ve seen on multiple other ICE and electric scooters. There is a lot of space to have one on the front apron, and it would save the user the hassle of opening the boot to store their small items every time they set off. Plenty of space available for an external storage cubby on the front apron, but the Rizta doesn’t get one. But the main issue is that over the past two months, I’ve been experiencing an electronic niggle that puts the Rizta into limp mode without any warning. The display shows nothing out of the ordinary except for the regen braking symbol indicating that it’s turned off. And when this happens, power delivery becomes very dull, and I’m unable to cross 25kph. A faulty connector in one of the sensors means it intermittently goes into limp mode without warning. This issue gets resolved temporarily if I cycle the ignition key, but it’s not an everlasting fix, and it reappears without warning. Upon speaking with Ather’s tech team, we have been informed that this has occurred due to a fault in the connector of one of the sensors, and this is the first time someone has reported this occurrence. This electronic niggle has somewhat dampened my confidence in the scooter, and I have been mindful not to stray outside a 10km radius of my home with the Rizta. We will be giving the scooter to the service team for an overall checkup and to have this issue resolved. Once the Rizta is back with us, the rest of our tenure with it, hopefully, will be trouble-free! Also See: Ather Rizta long term review, 1,200km report Ather Rizta long term review, 700km report",

    "description": "Welcome to Ibiza, the playground of millionaires and billionaires, and the perfect setting to test something as exclusive—and expensive—as the Mercedes-Maybach SL 680. But this isn’t just another Maybach. In fact, it’s a piece of history reborn: for the first time since the 1930s SW38, Maybach has ventured into two-door territory with this roadster. Customers have been asking for a two-door Maybach for years, and Mercedes' uber-luxury brand has finally delivered. Mercedes-Maybach SL 680 design and engineering Built on the bones of the AMG SL 63, the Maybach version reinterprets the sporty roadster into something far more indulgent. What really stands out are the exclusive Maybach colours. Our test cars came in a rich, garnet red inspired by pomegranate, and an elegant two-tone combination of obsidian black and opalite white that oozed class. There are plenty of shades to choose from, because offering something bespoke is core to any super-luxury brand. Maybach says customers prefer the monogrammed bonnet over the plainer alternative.  The highlight is undoubtedly the “Monogram” bonnet—adorned with dozens of tiny Maybach logos arranged in a repeating pattern (hence the Monogram Series badge), evoking the look of luxury fashion houses like Louis Vuitton. It’s polarising, yes, but Maybach says customers love it. In fact, most buyers choose the monogrammed bonnet over the plainer alternative, which is rarely specified. Maybachs are known for their liberal use of chrome, and the SL 680 doesn’t hold back. The grille, Maybach wordmark, centre bonnet fin, A-pillars, and rear apron all sparkle with polished metal accents. The 21-inch multi-spoke alloys are a Maybach-exclusive Another standout feature is the pair of bespoke, Maybach-exclusive 21-inch alloy wheels. You can choose between an elegant multi-spoke design or a dramatic five-spoke monobloc pattern that looks absolutely stunning. Mercedes-Maybach SL 680 interior space and comfort Step inside, and it’s a sea of white. The all-white interior—finished in sustainably tanned Nappa leather—feels airy, indulgent, and unmistakably Maybach. Diamond-stitched seats, a dual-tone steering wheel, and Maybach-specific trim patterns give the cabin a luxury yacht-like ambience. White sustainably tanned Nappa leather upholstery feels indulgent and unmistakably Maybach. That said, while the white-only theme looks gorgeous under Ibiza’s sun, it could be a nightmare to maintain in India’s dusty, monsoon-prone environment. And while nearly every other part of the cabin feels bespoke, the central touchscreen—carried over from the AMG SL and even found in the humble C-Class- undercuts the otherwise opulent atmosphere. At this level, a unique interface would’ve made all the difference. Mercedes-Maybach SL 680 performance and refinement At its heart is the same 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8, putting out 585hp and 800Nm of torque. But this isn’t about lap times. It’s about wafting, cruising, and making a statement—one that says you’ve arrived, and probably own a villa to park it in front of. A dedicated Maybach drive mode softens throttle response and further smoothens gear shifts. Even in Sport mode, which adds just a hint of sharpness, the ride never turns harsh. The 9-speed torque converter has been recalibrated for leisurely shifts. True, it results in a slightly slower 0–100 km/h time (4.1 seconds versus the AMG SL 63’s 3.6), but what you get in return is a velvet-gloved surge of torque that feels utterly effortless. The drive experience is leisurely and all about making a statement. Make no mistake—the SL 680 is still properly quick. The V8 sounds glorious too—slightly subdued compared to the AMG, but still raspy and full-bodied. Steering has also been retuned with a slower ratio and more relaxed off-centre response—perfect for confident, laid-back cruising on tight European roads or wide Indian expressways alike. The three-layer fabric roof can be raised or lowered in about 16 seconds, even at speeds of up to 50 km/h. With the hood up, refinement is astonishing and you can’t believe you’re in a soft top. Mercedes-Maybach SL 680 ride comfort and handling   If there’s one area where the Maybach SL 680 truly shines, it’s comfort. The transformation from AMG to Maybach goes far beyond the leather and logos. The suspension has been comprehensively reworked—damping, bushings, springs—all retuned for plushness. The result? Possibly the most comfortable roadster on sale today. The SL 680 is possibly the most comfortable roadster on sale today. The ride is sublime. It absorbs imperfections like few other convertibles can, and it feels as serene with the roof up as it does with it down. Mercedes engineers have even stuffed in over 18kg of sound-deadening material to shut out wind and road noise. The result is astonishing. Even at speed, it's eerily quiet. The handling is calm and composed rather than razor-sharp, and that’s exactly the point. This isn’t a car that eggs you on. It encourages you to slow down, take in the view, and let the world admire you as much as you admire the world. Mercedes-Maybach SL 680 price and verdict Exclusivity defines Maybach, and this SL 680 Monogram Series is no exception—with only three units allocated for India. At Rs 4.2 crore apiece, it certainly isn’t cheap. But what does that kind of exclusivity buy you? It is unnecessarily excessive, but it makes you feel special every time you get in it.  The Maybach SL 680 isn’t just a car—it’s an experience. It fuses the joy of open-top motoring with Maybach’s hallmark craftsmanship. Yes, the monogrammed bonnet may not be to everyone's taste, and the recycled infotainment screen is a rare misstep, but these are minor quibbles in a car that delivers on its brief: to make you feel special every single time you get in. For those fortunate few who can afford it, the Maybach SL 680 is a rolling expression of wealth, taste, and individuality. It's niche, it’s excessive, and it’s entirely unnecessary—but in a good way.

    "description": "Before the hotly anticipated Golf GTI makes it to India, Volkswagen has launched the Tiguan R-Line. In the past, we have had it with the diesel engine, then came the three-row Tiguan Allspace and finally was reverted back to being a five-seater with a petrol engine. The new model comes in as a CBU (Completely Built Unit), gets a 2.0-litre, 204hp TSI engine, a five-seat layout and a Rs 50 lakh price tag. It is a unique offering, but is it worth the money? VW Tiguan R-Line exterior design and engineering (8/10) Longer and wider than the outgoing Tiguan SUV Where the previous Tiguans were all angular, the new one embraces curves and bold lines. Dimensionally, it is longer and wider but gets the same wheelbase as before and has shortened in terms of height now. The front gets a simple and clean look with Matrix LED headlamps up top along with a DRL strip that stretches the width of the car. The bumper low down features blacked out treatment for fake mesh and large air dams to channel air around the car. Also a chunky chrome strip at the bottom adds some bling to an otherwise sporty look. Matrix LED headlights are bridged by a closed grille, which also features an ‘R’ badge. The side features dual-tone 19-inch wheels that look sporty along with gloss black wheel arches. There are two sharp creases on the shoulder line and a chrome strip surrounding the windows. It gets 176mm of ground clearance and roof rails to add some height to the look. However, it does miss out on keyless entry. At the rear, the IQ LED taillamps stretch from end to end and the upright design gives it that typical SUV look. No exhaust tips here seems to be a missed opportunity for the R-Line but it does get some more chrome. Overall, it is a design typical to VWs. Restrained but widely acceptable. Volkswagen Tiguan R-Line tech specsSuspension (f/r)Independent, MacPherson Strut, coil springs/ independent, multi-linkBrakes (f/r)DiscsTyres (f/r)255/ 45 R19Kerb weight1,758kgBoot space652 litresFuel tank60 litres VW Tiguan R-Line interior space and comfort (7/10) Buttonless dashboard, 15-inch touchscreen The Tiguan R-Line features a completely new interior apart from the steering wheel which shares a lot with the India 2.0 cars with the only difference being an ‘R’ on the steering base. The layout is simple and minimalistic and as a result the dashboard is completely buttonless. The only physical buttons are low down on the centre console where you have the electronic parking brake, the engine start stop and you have a knob which when you touch and press can change the settings from volume to drive modes. Minimalistic interior with most functions in the touchscreen. The rest of the features have been incorporated by the massive 15-inch touchscreen. Good news is the UX UI which is very simple and uncluttered. The menus and functions are intuitive and despite having the climate controls on the screen, it isn’t complicated. What it does miss out on is a 360-degree camera, which is a feature available on cars in much lower segments. Also, the resolution for the reversing camera is poor and in the dark it struggles for clarity. The screen otherwise is smooth, gets wireless connectivity and even ambient lighting with multiple themes. In terms of overall quality, it is a bit of a mix. While the build is good and on the top half of the dash and the doors you have soft touch material with exposed stitching, the lower half gets hard scratchy plastic that takes away some of that premium quotient. Amenities include a flip open cubby hole that reveals two wireless charging pads along with two type-C ports. There is more space lower down and then it also gets a large big cubby hole again with two cup holders.  Manual controls for adjusting front seat; lumbar adjustment is electric. In terms of comfort, the sport seats are very comfortable and get plenty of support with broad bolsters and even multiple massaging functions. Cooled seats are missing and instead it features seat heating, which for buyers in the north will come in handy once every year. The big miss though, is the absence of electric controls for the seat adjustment. In 2025, manually adjusting the seats on a Rs 50 lakh SUV is simply unacceptable. The lumbar adjustment is electric, but everything else requires arm twisting. Space is good, but no recline for the backrest robs some comfort. Since the wheelbase is similar to the previous version, space in the rear is good for two adults. However, the high transmission tunnel with the protruding AC vents means the middle passenger will have to suffer. What also robs away some comfort is the upright backrest that cannot be reclined. The seat can move further ahead to open up more luggage room, and the centre back rest flips open for easy access to the boot. Headroom, however, is impressive despite featuring a panoramic sunroof. 652-litre boot; seats can be flipped down and slid ahead for more room. Practicality wise the Tiguan R-Line features a huge 652 litre boot along with a space saver spare wheel under the boot floor. There are seat flip switches too but an electric tailgate is missing. VW Tiguan R-Line performance and refinement (7/10) 204hp-2.0-litre TSI engine; 0-100kph takes 7.1 seconds Volkswagen Tiguan R-Line powertrain specsEngine4 cyls, 1984cc, turbo-petrolPower204hp at 4,500-6,000rpmTorque320Nm at 1,500-4,400rpmGearbox7-speed dual-clutch autoDrive layoutFront engine, AWD0-100kph7.1 seconds Powering the Tiguan R-Line is a 2.0-litre TSI engine putting out 204hp and 320Nm and mated to a 7-speed DSG gearbox. Performance, however, is nothing to boast about.The power delivery is linear and it lacks punch, especially in the bottom-end of the rev range. 0-100kph is a respectable 7.1 secs but the overall drive won’t excite you. It gets drive modes and ‘Sport’ does offer some more eagerness, but apart from that there isn’t much to look forward to. It prefers being driven sedately on the highways. 204hp engine is refined but lacks bottom-end punch. What is nice, however, is the response from the paddle shifters. Even though the gearbox does not hold the gears till the 7,000rpm redline and upshifts around 6,000rpm, you can control a fair amount of the shifts, especially during downshifts. And while on the topic of redline, there isn’t a sweet exhaust note to speak of. The engine instead sounds coarse at high rpms so its best to upshift a bit early. Volkswagen Tiguan R-Line acceleration figures from a standstillFrom rest (in kph)Time (in seconds)201.12402.03603.26805.011007.101209.8914013.83 Volkswagen Tiguan R-Line in-gear acceleration figures (in kickdown)In-gear acceleration (in kph)Time (in seconds)20-804.1540-1005.32 VW Tiguan R-Line mileage (7/10) 12.58kpl (claimed by Volkswagen) VW claims 12.58kpl according to European approval methods and there isn’t an ARAI figure yet. However, it does get cylinder deactivation which means two of the four cylinders can automatically shut off to save fuel. Once we get the car for a longer duration we will put it through a proper fuel efficiency run according to Autocar Test Standards. VW Tiguan R-Line ride comfort and handling (8.5/10) New DCC Pro system adjusts damping in real time While the powertrain is relaxed and unassuming, what is very impressive is the ride and handling. The major contributing factor here being the DCC Pro (Dynamic Chassis Control), which can adjust the damping based on various factors. It works seamlessly and you can notice the difference between the stiffer Sport mode and the softer Comfort mode. On a winding section with smooth asphalt, the suspension takes into account the road surface, steering angle, and even throttle position to alter the damping. It stays flat and composed through corners and once the road gets bumpy, the firmness is exchanged with more absorption. Driving it in the twisties is fun, mainly thanks to adaptive dampers. What also changes character according to the modes is the steering heft. It is light and breezy in Comfort and weighs up in Sport. Add to that the well-bolstered seats, and the overall experience from behind the wheel is better on a ghaat section. Grip levels are good too courtesy the 4MOTION AWD system. VW Tiguan R-Line features and safety (7/10) Panoramic sunroof, Level 2 ADAS There is plenty of kit on the Tiguan R-Line since it is a CBU. It gets Matrix LED headlamps, 19-inch wheels, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a panoramic sunroof, massaging front seats, three-zone climate control, heated seats, 9 airbags, and Level 2 ADAS among others. What it misses out on, are ventilated seats, an electric tailgate and an electric adjust for front seats.

The engine isn’t too exciting, some features are missing and the rivals like the Skoda Kodiaq and even the Audi Q3 offer better value and brand strength respectively. What the Tiguan has in its favour is the ride and handling and a bit of exclusivity as it is a CBU and you won’t be seeing many out on the road. For the small pocket of buyers that don’t have the need for an extra row of seats and don't care for the badge, the Tiguan R-Line is an SUV worth checking out.

    "description": "The new Lamborghini Temerario is a plug-in hybrid using three Yasa motors – two up front, and one at the engine Firm plots huge growth as its tech is used in new models from Lamborghini, Mercedes-AMG and Ferrari British electric motor maker Yasa expects it will almost double its annual production volumes by 2026, as several major brands launch new plug-in hybrid and electric performance cars exploiting its technology. It said it expects annual production volumes to rise from just under 15,000 currently to around 25,000 in 2026, as its unique motor design underpins an increasing number of new cars from the likes of Lamborghini and Mercedes-AMG. It employs a proprietary axial flux design, dubbed the Yokeless and Segmented Armature (Yasa), that is claimed to be four times more power-dense than the radial flux motors common in today’s mainstream electric and hybrid cars. In simple terms, it provides a boost of around 150bhp or more in a package not much larger or heavier than a stack of three or four dinnerplates. Its motors have already been used in hybrids such as the Ferrari SF90, Ferrari 296 GTB and Lamborghini Revuelto. However, it is the upcoming Lamborghini Temerario that is set to comprise the bulk of the brand’s increase in output, given that it uses three Yasa motors and will be produced in large numbers. For reference, Lamborghini built more than 20,000 examples of the Temerario’s predecessor, the Hurácan, over its decade-long lifespan. As previously reported by Autocar, Yasa motors will also feature in the new super-saloon that Mercedes-AMG will unveil next month. It will be the first model based on the performance brand’s AMG.EA electric car platform. Autocar understands it will employ as many as three motors of a new design, each producing 473bhp in a unit weighing 24kg and occupying just five litres of space – roughly half the size and weight of a Tesla Model 3’s 241bhp radial flux motor. The same motor will also be deployed in the AMG variant of the new Mercedes-Benz CLA saloon due next year as well as a Porsche Cayenne Electric rival due in 2027. Senior staff at Yasa remain coy, however, about whether the AMG motors will be assembled solely in Oxfordshire or whether Mercedes will establish its own production line in continental Europe. Nonetheless, the rise in annual output has required an overhaul of the company’s factory, setting up two production lines dedicated to supplying motors according to the needs of Ferrari and Lamborghini. Discussing Yasa’s rise from a University of Oxford PhD project to a supplier to some of the world’s most prominent supercar manufacturers, founder and technology chief Tim Woolmer told Autocar: “Ferrari said to us: ‘We cannot find a supplier on the planet that can fit a motor in the space [65mm] we have, because the engine crank is very low’. “They physically couldn't get the performance they wanted from any other product on the planet. That's a nice piece of business, if you're told that, because it means that you're almost designed into their vehicle for life.” Commercial director Andy North added: “Last year, something like 75% of Ferraris that came out of Maranello had a Yasa motor.\" Yasa executives suggested that the company has a similar arrangement with Lamborghini, with its motors being integral to the design of the Revuelto and Temerario.  Woolmer suggested that Yasa’s ultimate ambition is to become a byword for performance in the same vein as firms such as Brembo. He said: “They are the go-to people for high-performance brakes. There are a few brands like that in automotive, and we want Yasa’s brand to be synonymous with that, but equally with having the volume in the manufacturing to back it up.” Yasa developing radical new in-wheel motor In-wheel motors have become a focal point of EV development over the past two years, as new materials, designs and production techniques have mitigated concerns around the effects of adding unsprung weight. Among the most prominent manufacturers of in-wheel motors is Surrey-based Protean. But Woolmer revealed to Autocar that Yasa is also angling for a slice of the market, saying: “Probably in 12 to 14 months, we will be showing off our technology for the first time, and it will blow your socks off.\" He added that EVs are currently “in the 1930s”, comparing the benefits brought by in-wheel motors to the development of disc brakes by Dunlop and Jaguar in the early 1950s. “I would guess in a significant period of time from now – 20, 30 or 40 years – that every electric car will have in-wheel motors. That would be my guess. But it will be a fairly bumpy road and very challenging to get there.”",

    "description": "Lower-rung AMG gains butch looks and big power. Can it stick it to the BMW M4? It’s been a while since Mercedes-AMG model designations had any bearing on engine capacities, but we thought we’d figured this out, right? 63 is the full-house one, 53 is basically an AMG Line pack on the biggest engine. Then in comes the Mercedes-AMG CLE 53. It's all butch with its wider wheel arches and the spec sheet mentions a rear-wheel-drive-only drift mode (it’s four-wheel drive as standard). A combined 443bhp and 4.2sec to 62mph sound pretty full-house as well.Sure, it’s slower than a BMW M4, but super-coupé performance has well and truly jumped the shark anyway, so that’s just a question of how unusable you want your performance to be.There is going to be a 63 version, which will reportedly have a V8 but it remains to be seen whether it will be a heavy, complicated plug-in hybrid.At that point, this mild-hybrid, inline-six Mercedes-AMG CLE 53 might seem like the purer, simpler driver’s car, in as much as you can even apply those words to a two-tonne, mild-hybrid car with variable four-wheel drive and four-wheel steering.",

    "description": "Over the weekend of the Barber Vintage Festival, I had a few goals: to show off a few bikes, hang with friends, and race my 1960 Harley-Davidson pan/shovel (or “dirt shovel”) in the cross-country race. This race was usually reserved for the likes of Hondas, Yamahas, Husqvarnas, OSSAs, and Pentons. Needless to say, I was the odd man out and loving it. Most of my fellow riders would be on sub-300-lb bikes. But my dance partner of choice was a 600-lb, 1200cc Milwaukee gorilla. Oh, and did I mention it was the early stock rigid chassis? Even at registration, they asked me repeatedly, “Are you sure you wanna go through with this?” They obviously didn’t know my reputation for throwing this thing down fire roads, power line trails, ice lakes, and flat tracks every chance I get.…",

Skoda claims a WLTP range of 562km for the Enyaq RS and 568km for the Coupe. The battery can be charged at speeds of up to 185kW, taking 26 minutes to go from 10 to 80 percent. An 11kW AC charger is said to take 8 hours to top up the battery from 0 percent to full. Additionally, the RS versions get 340hp of power that is sent to all four wheels (up from 286hp seen on the Enyaq Coupe AWD), which means that they are also quicker to sprint from 0 to 100kph. Both have a claimed time of 5.4 seconds, which is 1.3 seconds quicker than their standard higher-spec counterparts. Skoda Enyaq RS, Enyaq Coupe RS interior, exterior changes Blacked-out exterior elements and 2 interior upholstery options Compared to the standard Enyaq and Enyaq Coupe, their RS versions sport numerous blacked-out elements – from the Skoda and RS badges to the window trims, mirrors and winglets on the redesigned front bumper – and larger 20-inch alloy wheels (21-inch ones are optional), and they come with an additional Mamba Green colour option. Interestingly, the Enyaq RS and Coupe RS have slightly higher drag coefficients of 0.251 and 0.239, respectively, than their slower counterparts (0.245 and 0.225), which makes them marginally less aerodynamically efficient. Inside, the RS-badged versions get 2 options: the sporty RS Lounge and the elegant RS Suite. The RS Lounge’s highlights include Suedia microfibre and faux leather with lime green contrast stitching and piping. The RS Suite gets leather and faux leather upholstery with grey stitching and piping. Regardless of the interior option, both get an RS-spec 3-spoke steering wheel along with integrated headrest sports seats – the driver’s seat includes a massage function – as standard. The feature list is the same as the standard model.

    "description": "The Tata Altroz facelift has finally broken cover, marking the first major update to the premium hatchback since its January 2020 launch. This facelift brings comprehensive changes to the Altroz’s styling, interior layout and feature list, while retaining the existing powertrain line-up. The Altroz facelift will be available in five variants, namely Smart, Pure, Creative, Accomplished S, and Accomplished+ S. Tata Altroz facelift gets new LED headlights, connected tail-lamps, etc Cabin updated with new digital cluster and other features Altroz remains the only diesel hatchback on sale in India 2025 Tata Altroz facelift exterior design Substantial changes on the outside The Altroz facelift gets a thoroughly revised front end, with new full-LED split headlights with updated signatures for the daytime running lights, a new grille design with layered rectangular elements, and a redesigned front bumper with vertical recesses for the fog-lamp housings. Over to the side, notable updates include flush-fitting illuminated door handles and new 16-inch 5-spoke alloy wheels. At the rear, the Altroz facelift comes with new horizontal T-shaped LED tail-lamps, now connected by an LED light bar that adds visual width and looks slightly similar to that of the Hyundai Venue. There’s also a sportier dual-tone rear bumper and ‘Altroz’ lettering on the lower end of the tailgate. There are five colour options to choose from – Dune Glow, Ember Glow, Pristine White, Pure Grey, and Royal Blue. 2025 Tata Altroz facelift interior and features Cabin changes inspired by Nexon and Curvv Inside, the Altroz facelift has been refreshed with a cleaner dashboard design. Its cabin lifts several components from the Tata Nexon and Curvv, such as the 2-spoke steering wheel, 10.25-inch all-digital instrument cluster, and auto AC controls, to name a few. Tata has also added some features that were previously exclusive to the outgoing Altroz Racer variant. Meanwhile, features like an electric sunroof, cruise control, rear AC vents, ambient lighting, 90-degree opening doors, automatic headlights and wipers, and a 360-degree camera, among others, have been carried forward from the current model. 2025 Tata Altroz facelift engine and gearbox No changes under the hood The Altroz facelift continues with the same powertrain options as the outgoing model: an 88hp, 1.2-litre petrol engine with a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox, a 74hp factory-fitted CNG version with a 5-speed manual, and a 90hp 1.5-litre diesel engine with a 5-speed manual. Notably, in India, the Altroz is the only hatchback that offers a diesel engine. It remains to be seen if the Altroz facelift will also offer the 120hp, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox powertrain available with the current Altroz Racer. 2025 Tata Altroz facelift price and rivals Prices yet to be announced The facelifted Altroz competes in the premium hatchback segment against the Hyundai i20, Maruti Suzuki Baleno and Toyota Glanza. Tata has yet to announce pricing for the Altroz facelift, but expect a slight increase over the outgoing model’s ex-showroom price range of Rs 6.65 to 11.30 lakh.
