    "title": "Hybrids can be sold until 2035 as government relaxes EV targets",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/hybrids-can-be-sold-until-2035-government-relaxes-ev-targets",
    "description": "Government brings forward changes to ZEV mandate, allowing wider variety of hybrids to remain on sale until 2035 The UK government has substantially relaxed the framework of its zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate in a show of support to the automotive industry, following the US's imposition of 25% tariffs on all vehicles imported into the country.  As part of the shake-up, the government has confirmed that 'full' hybrid cars such as the Nissan Qashqai e-power can remain on sale from 2030-2035, low-volume car makers will be exempt from the need to achieve an 80% electric car sales mix in 2030, and all manufacturers have greater flexibility in how they can meet the annual EV sales targets imposed by the mandate. Late last year, the government pledged to rework the mandate in consultation with the car industry, in light of organic demand for electric cars falling well below the mandated targets and threatening car makers' ability to trade profitably. The government launched a public consultation, and has now brought forward its response. Under the terms of the mandate, car makers must achieve a 28% EV sales mix in 2025, but recent industry figures reveal that demand is running more than eight percentage points behind that. The government had already pledged to roll out the changes as a matter of urgency – after car makers spent billions on discounting EVs to boost demand and hit last year's 22% EV mix target – but the need for action became more acute last week when US president Donald Trump announced swingeing 25% import tariffs on all foreign-made cars, a huge blow to the UK car industry, which sent 27% of its output Stateside last year. As a result, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has accelerated the roll-out of the changes, saying that \"the new era of global insecurity means that the government must go further and faster reshaping our economy through the Plan for Change\". The government says the changes will \"make it easier for industry to upgrade to make electric vehicles, while delivering the manifesto commitment to stop sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, which will help even more British consumers access the benefits of cheap to run electric vehicles\". It will follow up the revamped ZEV mandate with the unveiling of a \"modern industrial strategy\" in summer, \"which will help British businesses realise the potential of industries of the future\". The UK government is still attempting to negotiate a new trade deal with Trump in a bid to neutralise the impact of the tariff, but ministers are drawing up a list of retaliatory measures the UK could put in place in the coming weeks if he is unsuccessful.  The government said: \"Support for the car industry will be kept under review as the impact of new tariffs become clear.\" Hybrids to remain on sale past 2030 The government says that allowing hybrids to remain on sale until 2035 will \"ease the transition and give industry more time to prepare\". Last month, there was a 37.9% year-on-year uptick in registrations of plug-in hybrids in the UK, and other types of hybrid – including mild hybrids – recorded a 27.7% hike, giving electrified cars a combined market share of 25%, compared to 20.7% for pure-electric. Confirmation that full- and plug-in hybrids can stay in showrooms until 2035 comes five years after former prime minister Boris Johnson imposed the 2030 ban on the sale of new combustion-engined cars, while allowing some hybrids with a \"meaningful electric range\" to continue for another five years - though the definition of 'meaningful' was never publicly defined. The government now says that both 'full' hybrids (HEVs) – those with a smaller battery that is charged solely by the combustion engine – and PHEV models will now be allowed between 2030 and 2035, although it has yet to outline any specific technical requirements, instead listing some example models. The government cites the Toyota Prius as one example of an HEV, although that model is currently sold exclusively as a plug-in hybrid in the UK. It also lists Nissan's e-Power cars, which are electrically driven, but with a petrol engine on board serving as a generator to top up a small-capacity traction battery.  The government does say that, from 2030, manufacturers will need to \"make sure the overall CO2 emissions from their petrol and diesel cars is 10% lower than it was in 2021\". Autocar has contacted the Department for Transport for clarity on exactly what the new rules mean for mild hybrids, range-extenders and traditional full hybrids.  Nonetheless, the announcement will come as a significant reassurance to car makers investing heavily in hybrid technology in a bid to decarbonise their line-ups amid slower-than-expected demand for pure-electric cars. Toyota, for example, had previously threatened \"there would be an impact on a number of areas\" of its business in the UK if full-hybrids – like the Corolla it builds at Burnaston in Derbyshire – were banned from sale alongside pure-ICE cars in 2030.  And Kia's UK boss Paul Philpott told Autocar recently that clarity on post-2030 hybrid sales \"will help us make final decisions about product line-up during that period\".  The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) had previously urged the government to recognise \"the role that all technologies – including hybrids, plug-in hybrids and hydrogen – have to play in decarbonising road transport, as either stepping stones towards, or full delivery of, a zero-tailpipe-emission market by 2035\". Meanwhile, the government has confirmed that pure-ICE vans can stay on sale through to 2035, along with hybrid and PHEV vans.  The fines for missing the ZEV mandate targets have also been reduced, from £15,000 to £12,000 per car for each manufacturer that misses the target. Low-volume car makers exempt from rules The revisions to the ZEV mandate also include a new exemption for \"small and micro-volume\" manufacturers from the ZEV targets and the new 2030-2035 hybrid requirements, so they now don't need to follow mainstream firms in achieving an 80% EV sales mix in 2030. The government cites McLaren and Aston Martin as specific examples of companies that will be granted the exemption, but the 'small volume' definition applies to any firm producing fewer than 2500 cars per year. The decision will help with \"pressing some of the UK car industry's most iconic jewels for years to come\", said the government.  Currently, neither Aston Martin nor McLaren sell an electric car, and Aston recently delayed the launch of its first EV in favour of a new line of plug-in hybrid sports cars. This new exemption will give those companies – along with Bentley, Rolls-Royce, Lotus and LEVC – more time to transition their customers from combustion cars to EV alternatives. The exemption will also apply to ultra-low-volume sports car manufacturers including Morgan, Caterham, Ariel, Radical, BAC and Gordon Murray Automotive - none of which have an electric car in production as yet. Morgan boss Matthew Hole recently told Autocar that time was fast running out for his company to develop a pure-electric car by 2030, and called for urgent clarity on whether it would be obliged to. He said there was \"just way too much ambiguity\" around the rules of the ZEV mandate for low-volume firms, and said Morgan's forward strategy was fully contingent on whether it would be exempt from the need to achieve an 80% EV sales mix in 2030. More flexible EV sales targets While the headline targets of the ZEV mandate are unchanged – meaning manufacturers must still achieve a 28% EV mix this year and 80% by 2030 – the government has made it easier for them to achieve compliance by making the Non-Zero Emission Car CO2 Trading Scheme (CCTS) more flexible. This scheme essentially allows manufacturers to offset sales of non-electric cars by exceeding their CO2 reduction targets, and earns them a lower mandated EV sales mix target in a given year.  One important change to the CCTS system is that car makers can now benefit from the credit-transferring mechanism through to 2029, having previously only been able to spend these credits in the three years to 2026. This enables \"significant additional flexibility to reward CO2 savings from hybrids\" over the next five years, said the government.  It will introduce caps for each year, but has not yet said what these will be.  Meanwhile, the mechanism of 'borrowing' EV sales credits from future years will now be possible through to 2030, having previously been set to end in 2026.  This means car makers can underperform against the ZEV targets in a given year if it compensates for that the following year - though there will be caps imposed upon this, too.  Car makers are currently only allowed to 'borrow' up to half of their mandated 28% EV sales mix in 2025, and next year that goes down to a quarter. Finally, manufacturers will now be able to trade credits between vans and cars: a credit for selling one electric car can be exchanged for 0.4 van credits, and an electric van credit can be exchanged for two cars.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/technology/extreme-road-racing-series-will-show-what-hydrogen-can-do",
    "description": "Inside the new FIA Extreme H World Cup racers that will give FCEV tech its most challenging test yet The hydrogen fuel cell could be one of the most highly developed and rigorously tested automotive technologies never to reach mainstream production, but that doesn’t mean it won’t. The FIA Extreme H World Cup, a new off-road motorsport championship due to kick off later this year, aims to demonstrate just how capable the technology is.  Not only will its Pioneer 25 cars be powered by hydrogen fuel cells consuming sustainably produced hydrogen but the electricity powering on-site activities at the events will be generated using stationary fuel cells too. The cars are based on Extreme E electric off-road racers, using the same kind of electric drivetrain but with the batteries partially replaced by a 75kW hydrogen fuel cell system. The stack is fuelled by 2kg of compressed hydrogen gas stored at 700 bar in two Toyota Mirai tanks.  Fuel cells are best suited to providing a steady stream of power rather than the transient bursts motors need, so there’s a 325kW, 36kWh battery in between the two, acting as a buffer. Operating at 450V-850V, the battery powers two 268bhp motors driving front and rear axles and making 536bhp in total. Top speed is 124mph and 0-62mph takes 4.5sec, despite the car’s hefty 2200kg weight. The fuel cell is supplied by Symbio but the aim is to allow teams to use their own fuel cell system if they wish. Batteries come from Fortescue WAE, which opened a technical centre at Kidlington, Oxfordshire, in 2023 and also provided the batteries for Extreme E. Extreme H batteries will be produced there too, but they have a slightly smaller capacity than those used in Extreme E, as the main power source is now the fuel cell.  As with Extreme E, the cars are manufactured by Spark Racing Technology, based at Tigery, outside Paris.  Each one is 6m long with a wheelbase of 3.2m (so roughly the same as a BMW 7 Series) and based on a tubular spaceframe chassis with front impact structures.  The Pioneer 25 passed its mandatory FIA chassis crash tests last year. Compared with an Extreme E car, the Pioneer 25 has a strengthened chassis, extra carbon-composite crash structures over the hydrogen tanks and energy-absorbing composite structures on either side of the car.  High- and low-pressure hydrogen systems were fitted during the tests and both were fully pressurised to ensure neither would lose any pressure. The cars also completed FIA resilience tests for tanks and batteries before testing could take place, so the race series should be a useful demonstration of the robustness of fuel cell technology generally, given the pounding they will take.",

That was almost the story with this imposing, yet refined, Harley-Davidson Street Bob. “He requested the more bling side of Rough Crafts—if that makes sense,” Winston explains. “Some of our bikes are ‘black black,’ and some have some shiny bits and a more luxurious feel. That’s what he was looking for.” Rough Crafts started with a 2022-model Street Bob—a bike that Winston favors for its simple layout and minimalist build. Rough Crafts is based in Taiwan, where strict regulations rule out the possibility of altering a bike’s frame and keeping it street-legal.…",

    "description": "Maruti Suzuki and Honda have given their compact sedans a significant update, bringing us the fourth-generation Dzire and the third-generation Amaze, respectively. Can these sedans carry on the fight in an increasingly SUV-dominated market? With these new-gen models, both brands have also placed a strong emphasis on safety this time around. Standard features on both cars now include ESP, six airbags and hill-start assist. Additionally, the Amaze stands out with its camera-based ADAS suite, while the Dzire has earned a 5-star Global NCAP crash-safety rating. And now, with similar features and specifications, the two sedans are closer than ever. So, we put their petrol-automatic iterations through our exhaustive tests to find out which one comes out on top. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire exterior design Amaze boasts a higher ground clearance and a longer wheelbase. The Amaze follows Honda’s latest design philosophy, bearing a strong resemblance to its larger siblings. Its front shares styling cues with the Elevate SUV, while the rear resembles the City. Though the side profile remains unmistakably Amaze, elements such as door-mounted mirrors and 185/60 R15 diamond-cut alloys provide a modern touch. The new Dzire impresses with its large Audi-esque grille, and the LED headlamps look sleek. Like the Amaze, its side profile is familiar to its previous generation, but distinctive tail-lights featuring a tri-arrow LED signature and a subtle boot lip spoiler add character. Dzire is taller, but Amaze has a higher ground clearance Dimensionally, both cars are near-identical in length and width, but the Dzire is 25mm taller and rides on slightly higher-profile 185/65 R15 tyres. The Amaze boasts a 20mm longer wheelbase and higher ground clearance (172mm versus Dzire’s 163mm). The Dzire AMT weighs 960kg, making it 26kg lighter than the Amaze. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire interior Honda’s hallmark ergonomics shine through, and its high-set seats result in excellent visibility. With a dashboard that resembles that of an Elevate, the Amaze’s interior adopts a minimalist approach. The beige-black colour scheme adds some brightness, and Honda’s hallmark ergonomics shine through with well-placed storage spaces and excellent visibility. Also carried forward from the Elevate are its superbly executed part-analogue, part-digital instrument cluster and the neat, buttoned climate control console. Where the Amaze must improve is the front-seat comfort; the absence of adequate seat base support becomes glaringly evident in this comparison. Its rear seat fares much better in this aspect – there’s good support, and the backrest angle is more comfortable than the Maruti. Three fixed headrests not only improve comfort but also provide whiplash protection to adults seated here. And while neither of these sedans is wide enough to seat three adults comfortably, the Amaze’s rear air-con console protrudes a fair bit into the middle passenger’s kneeroom. Also, taller passengers will find the headroom in limited supply in the Amaze. Dzire interior feels more spacious and comfortable Some textured bits enhance its appeal, as do features like a larger screen and sunroof. There’s a greater sense of space inside the Dzire due to its design and lighter colour scheme. Some smartly executed textured bits lift its appeal, while its larger 9-inch touchscreen and a sunroof add a touch of modernity. It also gets an edge over the Amaze due to its broader, more supportive seats. For short drives, its soft cushioning feels very comfortable, too. However, this could induce some body ache after spending extended hours in the car during long drives. Its rear seat is just as accommodating as the Honda’s, but with a bit more headroom due to a scooped-out roof, taller passengers will be comfier here. While both cars have ample storage areas spread across the cabin, the Dzire’s 382-litre boot is a bit smaller than the Amaze’s, which measures 416 litres. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire price and features Amaze (clockwise): Camera-based ADAS works well under most conditions; The front seats’ base is small and needs better support; Rear AC console eats into the kneeroom of passengers; Smooth transmission complements its engine well. The Honda Amaze CVT comes in three variants priced between Rs 9.35 lakh and Rs 11.20 lakh, whereas the Dzire AMT’s range of Rs 8.34 lakh to Rs 10.19 lakh makes it significantly more affordable. The features common to their top trims include auto LED headlamps, 15-inch alloys, keyless entry, wireless charging, automatic climate control, rear air vents, cruise control, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, ESP and six airbags. Dzire (clockwise): Includes in-vogue features like a sunroof and a 360-deg cam; The AMT gearbox’s shifts are jerky; No headrest for the middle passenger; Faux wood, silver inserts and textures enhance its appeal. The Dzire AMT stands out with a 360-degree camera, a sunroof and a larger 9-inch touchscreen (compared to the Amaze’s 8-inch unit). However, during our tests, its screen froze on more than one occasion while connected to Android Auto. Amaze distinguishes itself with ADAS features For the Rs 1 lakh premium that the Amaze CVT commands over the Dzire AMT, it gets paddle shifters, a part-digital instrument cluster, and an ADAS package featuring lane-keeping assist, blind-spot monitoring, autonomous emergency braking and adaptive cruise control. These ADAS features are well-calibrated to suit Indian driving conditions and function in a non-intrusive manner, making highway drives more convenient and safer.

Amaze’s 1.2-litre 4-cylinder petrol engine is carried over from the previous-gen model and, hence, remains very similar in its characteristics. It is an enjoyable unit with a strong mid-range and a free-revving nature. But performance at the lower end of the rev range feels weak, especially below 2,000rpm. Its continuously variable transmission (CVT) keeps the engine spinning optimally, thus extracting the best out of this unit. And in the absence of fixed gears, this belt-pulley automatic works seamlessly. However, enthusiastic user input results in a noticeable rubber-band effect, where the revs increase without a corresponding effect on vehicle speed; this makes an already buzzy engine sound even harsher. Honda’s free-revving mill can get quite vocal when spun faster. The new Dzire switches to Maruti’s latest 1.2-litre Z12E petrol engine that has one less cylinder. And, at 82hp, makes 8hp less than the Amaze as well as its own previous-generation model. However, as we’ve seen with the Swift, where it debuted, this three-cylinder unit’s clear focus on low-end torque aids drivability, as does its crisp throttle response. 5-speed AMT is a sore point for the Dzire's driving experience These make the Dzire feel rather effortless within urban confines. But the 5-speed automated manual transmission (AMT) is the weakest link in this package. Yes, it provides the convenience of clutch-free driving, and even though it can be categorised as fine by AMT standards, you will feel a prominent lag between gear shifts; it is nowhere near as smooth or seamless as the Amaze’s CVT. Maruti’s three-cylinder unit is surprisingly refined and drivable. In our performance tests, the Amaze accelerates from 0-100kph in 13.12 seconds, 2.09 seconds quicker than the Dzire AMT. Interestingly, their rolling acceleration times from 20-80kph and 40-100kph are very similar. Pedal to the metal, the Honda CVT tops out at 148kph, whereas the Dzire AMT hits a higher top speed of 170kph.

Honda claims an ARAI-rated efficiency of 19.46kpl for the Amaze CVT, whereas Maruti claims a staggering 25.71kpl for the Dzire AMT. Although nowhere as close, in our real-world tests, the Amaze CVT and Dzire AMT averaged 13.28kpl and 15.41kpl, respectively. The Amaze CVT achieved 16.62kpl on the highway and 9.94kpl in the city, whereas the Dzire returned a higher 19.22kpl and 11.61kpl, respectively. Notably, neither car gets an Eco mode; the Dzire has an automatic engine stop-start feature to check fuel consumption while idling. However, in extreme 45-degree heat, this feature struggled due to the air conditioning’s higher fan speed requirements to maintain the preset 22 degrees Celsius cabin temperature in full-auto mode. In contrast, the Amaze maintained cabin temperature effectively with a lower fan speed. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire ride and handling The Amaze's steering is more responsive, but the Dzire wins on the low-speed ride front. A comfort-oriented setup makes the Amaze soak up the bumps and road imperfections rather competently, but the sharper potholes come through with a prominent ‘thwack’ from the suspension. At highway speeds, it tends to bounce on its soft springs, resulting in a fair bit of vertical movement over wavy surfaces – not ideal for those prone to road sickness. Dzire's ride is plusher at low speeds The Maruti is the comfier riding car since its low-speed ride is a touch more absorbent, and it does its duties in silence. Sharp movements do come through at highway speeds, so in that sense, its ride can feel busy when you up the pace. However, it recovers much better than the Amaze after a dip, and it doesn’t float as much either. Those who enjoy driving may prefer the Honda’s steering, which feels pointier and more fluid than the Maruti’s, but in terms of steering effort, the Dzire’s lighter unit, with its relatively shorter turning radius, will appeal to most buyers. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire verdict Honda Amaze ZX CVT: 8/10 Maruti Dzire ZXi+ AMT: 8/10 The Honda Amaze petrol-automatic gets the basics right with a far smoother driving experience and better outright performance, which will certainly appeal to self-driven owners. In addition, it is also equipped with segment-first ADAS. However, its powertrain could have done with better refinement, its front seats should have been more supportive, and its highway ride comes across as a bit bouncy. The Maruti Dzire isn’t perfect, and the jerky AMT gearbox is a letdown, but if you can look past this, it feels larger and more expensive on the inside, and its seats are comfier, too. The ride is plusher, the engine more refined, and it has a more desirable kit, including a sunroof and a 360-degree camera. Building the case further is the better fuel efficiency and a substantial Rs 1 lakh lower sticker price. All in all, then, the Dzire is the better all-rounder, ensuring it emerges the winner in this battle. Also see: Maruti Dzire vs Honda Amaze: Which is the new compact sedan for you?

    "description": "The Genesis G90 - the flagship luxury sedan of the Hyundai owned firm - has spawned two concepts which were revealed at the Seoul Mobility Show. Called the X Gran Coupe and X Gran Convertible, these niche model derivatives boast unique design elements and aim to expand the Genesis lineup in the future.  Both concepts resemble G90 donor limousine Built on short-wheelbase configuration of halo car Get 415hp 3.5-litre V6 petrol engine with mild hybrid system What is the Genesis X Gran concept? Fifth prototype from brand X Gran is the fifth concept from Genesis after the New York, GV80, Essentia and Mint. First showcased in 2021, the concept series presents the brand's vision for a sustainable and luxurious grand tourer cars featuring the signature Two Lines design.  Genesis X Gran coupe and convertible design Signature twin-lightbar design Both concepts closely resemble the G90 limousine and feature twin-lightbar design up front and at the rear. “The reasoning behind [the concepts] is making derivatives of the G90 which share the same platform, so it is cars that could be integrated into the lineup,\" Genesis design boss Luc Donckerwolke said at the show.  Frameless doors look production ready Previewed by the Genesis X concept, the 2025 coupe and convertible models retain their two doors; the G90 sedan has four doors. The frameless pair of doors with flush handles looks near-production ready, which may hint at what the road-ready version will look like. Aside from confirming that the cars use the short-wheelbase configuration of the G90 platform, the luxury carmaker did not state any dimensions. For G90 dimensions as a reference, see the table below. Genesis G90 short wheelbase dimensions (in mm)Length5275Width1930Height1490Wheelbase3180 Genesis X Gran coupe and convertible interior Crystal accents on key controls Over the standard G90, the X Gran concepts get crystal accents on the steering wheel, air vents and the centre console. The luxury positioning is further reflected in the aluminium-spoked steering wheel, screens embedded into the rear of the front headrests and the use of microperforated olive wood. The convertible also gets a cloth roof with varying grape colours inside and out. Genesis X Gran coupe and convertible powertrain Not fully electric as previously reported While it was earlier reported that the X Gran cars will have an all-electric powertrain, Genesis has borrowed the existing G90’s 3.5-litre V6 petrol engine with mild-hybrid tech for the concept car duo. Maximum power output is 415hp, which comes at 5,800rpm. Genesis India launch May arrive with SUV Hyundai has been evaluating bringing the Genesis brand to India, as Autocar India has previously reported. It may initially bring an SUV as a full import, with the Genesis GV80 being the strongest contender, backed by a design patent filing in the country. If the GV80 SUV is brought here, it will be pitted against the Mercedes GLE, BMW X5 and Audi Q7.

    "description": "Hyundai has officially teased the Ioniq 6 N all-electric performance sedan ahead of its global debut scheduled for July 2025. The tease came as part of the recent unveiling of the facelifted Ioniq 6 and its N Line variant, where the full-blown N model was hiding in the background of one image. Hyundai Ioniq 6 N teaser reveals two rear spoilers, larger diffuser, and more Interior to get three-spoke steering wheel, N-specific badging and drive modes, sports seats 84kWh, dual-motor powertrain likely; 650hp, 0-100kph in 3.4 seconds, 448km range The Ioniq 6 N’s formal reveal is scheduled for July 2025, possibly at this year’s Goodwood Festival of Speed. Hyundai Ioniq 6 N exterior and interior design Gets two rear spoilers Hyundai Ioniq 6 N Line used for representation. Although the image partially shows off the Ioniq 6 N’s rear end, the performance EV is immediately recognisable thanks to the hallmark Performance Blue finish popularised by Hyundai’s N models. Furthermore, the Ioniq 6 N sports two rear spoilers - a ducktail extending from the boot, and a larger wing mounted right beneath the windshield - and the N logo is in clear view on the blacked-out tailgate. The rear bumper includes a chunky diffuser, which looks to be inspired by Hyundai’s race-inspired RN22e concept car, and has red accents like other N models. While the front end remains a mystery for now, it’s expected to feature design elements similar to the newly-revealed Ioniq 6 N Line, including sporty color-contrasting strakes in the grille cover. Simon Loasby, Head of Hyundai Design, confirmed to our sister publication Autocar UK that the  Ioniq 6 N’s design changes are intended to “maintain aerodynamic performance while achieving a smoother, more refined silhouette.” Loasby also revealed that the large rear wing was added to counter lift more effectively, and that the Ioniq 6 N will have wider fenders than the Ioniq 5 N. Ioniq 6 N to offer exclusive interior features The Ioniq 6 N’s cabin is anticipated to largely resemble that of the regular facelifted model, but include the Ioniq 5 N’s performance features, such as a three-spoke N steering wheel, N badging, exclusive drive mode buttons, sporty front bucket seats, and more. Hyundai Ioniq 6 N powertrain and performance Hyundai Ioniq 6 N Line used for representation. Under the hood, the Ioniq 6 N will likely share the Ioniq 5 N’s 84kWh, dual-motor powertrain with simulated automatic gear shifts. This setup yields 650hp, a 0-100kph time of 3.4 seconds, and a top speed of 260kph in the Ioniq 5 N, with a WLTP-tested range of up to 448km.
