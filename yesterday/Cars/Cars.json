    "description": "Skoda's performance flagship has always been an everyman favourite. Does it still stack up? When Skoda launched the fourth-generation Skoda Octavia vRS with an electrified powertrain four years ago, it was a signal of intent from the brand for its future performance models, especially given this flagship’s long association with diesel power.Now, while other car makers look to push their plug-in hybrid offerings, both of those powertrains have been binned as part of the Octavia's mid-life refresh, with just the 2.0-litre turbo petrol remaining.Surprised? Given that the pure-ICE variant was the line-up’s best seller, Skoda says you shouldn’t be.This updated vRS adopts the same engine as can be found in the Volkswagen Golf GTI. It now features upgraded fuel injectors, increasing power by 20bhp to 262bhp and torque to 273lb ft, making it the most powerful Octavia vRS to date.It's also now set up exclusively with front-wheel drive, with power sent to the wheels via a seven-speed automatic gearbox. No more 4x4s or manuals here.The estate, with its 640 litres of seats-up boot space, generally accounts for around 60% of Octavia vRS sales.The chassis has undergone targeted modification to move the Octavia from ‘consummate family car’ to something altogether more toothy, and the cabin has followed suit, with Alcantara and perforated leather underscoring the vRS badge.",

    "title": "Everything you need to know about hydrogen fuel cell vehicles",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/technology/hydrogen-cars",
    "description": "Are hydrogen cars viable? We run through all you need to know about this alternative fuel The rise of battery-electric vehicles over the past few years has meant hydrogen cars have moved  closer to the fringes of the new car market.  Until relatively recently, two hydrogen models were available in the UK as new cars but make no mistake: hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are slowly emerging and they could yet become a viable option for some use cases in the future.  But what actually is a hydrogen car and how do they stack up to petrol, diesel and electric vehicles? We have all you need to know right here, including the pros and cons of hydrogen cars, and what the future looks like for them.  What is a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle? Hydrogen cars, or hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (often shortened to FCEV), are vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel. Hydrogen is stored in a tank at 700 bar and is used to generate high-voltage electricity to a small buffer battery, which provides transient power for acceleration. While many people tout hydrogen as the fuel of the future, the truth is that hydrogen cars have been around for decades. In 1998, Mercedes-Benz produced the first road-legal FCEV with the A-Class-based Necar. How do hydrogen fuel cell vehicles work? Cars draw their power from a fuel cell stack, where oxygen and hydrogen react to generate electricity, sending energy to an electric motor. This means they drive much like an electric car. Hydrogen cars produce zero harmful emissions at the tailpipe, making them a much cleaner proposition petrol or diesel cars, at least from the driver’s point of view.  How do you fill up a hydrogen car? Hydrogen cars can be refuelled using a pump at a hydrogen filling station. Hydrogen filling stations look much like a regular petrol or diesel forecourt. Refuelling a hydrogen car is a simple task - just open up the fuel filler cap and insert the pump. Typically, refuelling takes about five minutes.  The hardest part of refuelling a hydrogen car in the UK is finding a filling station. According to UK H2 Mobility, there are just six hydrogen filling stations available for public motorists in the UK.  Some are situated in Hatton Cross, London, Tullos in Aberdeen and the Advanced Manufacturing Park near Sheffield. There are plans for filling stations to be installed in Stockton-on-Tees, Glasgow and Newport. British start-up Element 2 is also planning to open four filling stations in 2024. A further 30 pump locations will be identified, with plans to install additional pumps by the end of the year. What's the latest on hydrogen cars? A lot is going on in the world of hydrogen cars, with Hyundai currently setting the pace. The Korean car brand recently revealed the Initium concept, which previews the next-generation hydrogen-powered Nexo and its modern design. It takes a single electric motor with 201bhp – 40bhp more than the existing Nexo – and Hyundai is aiming for a range of 404 miles between top-ups.  The Initium previews a production model that’s due to be unveiled by next summer, but it's unclear if it will ever come to the UK, considering that just 50 Nexos have been sold since it was launched five years ago. Hydrogen cars available in the UK Two hydrogen cars were until relatively recently available as new cars in the UK today and some car makers have hydrogen in their plans for production in the future.  Toyota Mirai The Toyota Mirai first appeared in 2015 and achieved 10,000 global sales before entering its second generation in 2021. The latest Mirai is equipped with a fuel stack capable of storing 5.6kg of hydrogen and has a WLTP range of up to 400 miles.  Despite being heavier and larger than the first-generation car, it takes just 8.7sec to travel from 0-62mph and 25.5sec to hit 100mph. That’s thanks to a powertrain that produces 180bhp and 221lb ft of torque. However, the Mirai wasn’t cheap when it was launched in 2021. It commanded a price of £64,995, and you can’t currently order one directly from Toyota. Read our Toyota Mirai review Hyundai Nexo Hyundai has been developing fuel cell technology since the 1990s, and the Nexo is the firm’s first production hydrogen car.  Priced similarly to the Mirai at £65,995, the Hyundai Nexo’s powertrain produces 161bhp and 291lb ft. Meanwhile, 0-62mph is completed in 9.6sec.  The Nexo can store up to 6.33kg of hydrogen, which supplies power to a 1.56kWh battery. It offers a range of around 380 miles, and we were impressed by its solid driving dynamics and rolling refinement.  There are fewer than 30 Nexos on UK roads today and, like the Mirai, it’s not currently available to order. Read our Hyundai Nexo review BMW iX5 Hydrogen BMW formed a partnership with Toyota based around hydrogen technology and it plans to bring the iX5 Hydrogen to market in some form by 2030.  With a 396bhp powertrain and 524lb ft of torque, it packs significantly more punch than the Toyota and Hyundai, backed up by its sub-6.0sec sprint from 0-62mph.  Range stands at around 313 miles and our drive of the car revealed it to be comfortable, capable and almost ready for the road. It certainly paves the way for BMW's entry into the world of hydrogen. Read our BMW iX5 Hydrogen review Pros of hydrogen cars One of the biggest benefits of driving a hydrogen car is that it produces zero emissions from the tailpipe apart from water. That means it's a lot more environmentally friendly to drive than a petrol or diesel car, and would be welcome in the ever-increasing number of clean air zones popping up around the UK.  Hydrogen cars are also significantly faster to fill up than electric cars. Hydrogen is the most abundant element on the planet too.  Some consider hydrogen cars to be more efficient than other powertrains, as hydrogen power uses between 40-60% of its fuel’s energy with a 50% reduction in fuel consumption. It’s not uncommon to see around 400 miles of travel on a single tank when using hydrogen.  Unlike EVs, the range of a hydrogen car is not impacted by outside temperatures.  Cons of hydrogen cars While hydrogen cars can be more efficient and environmentally friendly for the driver, there are some drawbacks. Emissions from the tailpipe might be zero, but there are significant environmental challenges with producing hydrogen on an industrial scale.  Producing hydrogen at this level uses a significant amount of fossil fuel. According to tyre giant Pirelli, as much as 10kg of CO2 is produced for every kilogram of hydrogen.  There are methods of producing hydrogen that use renewable energies, but these are currently far more expensive. Denmark, for example, produces hydrogen from wind, while Iceland uses geothermal energy to produce it.  Hydrogen cars are also quite expensive to buy due to their complexity and the small number of refuelling stations is a significant black mark against this technology. The future of hydrogen vehicles Currently, hydrogen cars aren’t quite viable for the broader public. There are simply too few filling stations, and the hydrogen itself isn’t yet commercially or environmentally viable to produce en masse.  But with investment from the UK government aiming to accelerate the implementation of hydrogen vehicles, we could see more car makers turn their efforts to this technology in the coming years.  One such company hoping to drive the production of hydrogen vehicles is Williams Advanced Engineering, which revealed a platform for hydrogen electric vehicles in 2023. It says the platform features a “cutting-edge\" H2 fuel cell system and a liquid-cooled battery pack with up to 576bhp available.  Elsewhere, Alpine has hinted that its radical V6 hydrogen car, called the Alpenglow, could make production. This combines a combustion engine with hydrogen power, which is injected into the cylinders to reduce toxic NOx emissions. For the general public, though, it looks like the future of cars in the UK will remain electric until the infrastructure and hydrogen production methods have become more viable.",

    "description": "With its casual bobber styling and easygoing twin-cylinder motor, the Royal Enfield Shotgun 650 isn’t the type of motorcycle you’d expect the unhinged crew at ICON Motosports to froth over. Nevertheless, Portland’s finest were nonplussed when Royal Enfield asked them to customize one for the annual EICMA trade show. ICON specializes in the outrageous—and nothing is quite as outrageous as turning a mild-mannered cruiser into a bonkers café racer-cum-drag bike. But getting the Shotgun from there to here necessitated a substantial overhaul of its chassis. Most of the frame’s rear half was binned, along with the bike’s wheels, suspension, and swingarm. With a new subframe welded into place, team ICON started piecing together the Shotgun’s new running gear. Some judicious finagling of the front end made room for a set of nitrogen forks from a Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10R.…",

Indian’s beginner-friendly cruiser has been out of circulation for four years, but it’s finally back. And, like the Scout, it returns with a new engine and a new tubular steel frame. If you’re not familiar with the Sixty’s backstory, it was introduced in 2015 as a more accessible version of the Scout, with a lower price tag and a smaller engine. The new Indian Scout Sixty continues that fine tradition, powered by a new 999 cc version of the 1,250 cc mill in the Indian Scout.

    "description": "As with the older Tour-X4, Arai’s latest Adventure helmet is very versatile, in that it can also be configured as a road helmet without the peak or an MX-style helmet without the visor. However, it now addresses a universal complaint with the previous Tour-X4 – its visor change mechanism that needed the removal of four screws. The new one debuts a much easier system where the entire peak and visor can be removed by using just a small push tab under the covering plate. In typical Arai fashion, it’s a marvelously over-engineered solution that can be intimidating to use at first, but you quickly figure it out, and the system works well. Just ensure that the mechanism is properly clicked into place before you ride off!   The X5 gets a new Pinlock-compatible visor that has a more rounded profile with improved optics. One of the big changes here is the removal of the trademark eyebrow vents in the visor, which is a bit bittersweet. On the one hand, those vents definitely work well, but the flip side is that they tend to leak in continuous heavy rain, even when closed. The Tour-X5 also drops the chin vents on the sides of the helmet jaw. The total number of vents has reduced, but the actual venting is still superb, so I have no complaints.      I spent a week in this helmet at the GS Trophy, which was easily the most intense riding of my life, and the comfort was excellent. The best helmets are the ones that melt away into the background and let you focus on your riding, and this one manages just that.  The Tour-X5’s peak has also been redesigned, and I found that it had noticeably less lift at high speeds on an adventure bike. It also feels much better on naked bikes, with negligible lift at a steady 100kph. However, the tradeoff is that wind noise is quite high, so it’s best to use this helmet on a bike with good wind protection.    The Tour-X5 has a weight similar to the Tour-X4   Weighing 1,650 grams, it is more or less the same as the T4, but like the old helmet, it feels superbly balanced and great for all-day usage. Another really appreciable change is that Arai knows almost all its customers will install a Bluetooth communicator, so they’ve made it easier to do so. The cheek pads now have dedicated circular Velcro extensions for your speakers, and there are even small wire-managing tabs built into the liner. This is definitely the nicest helmet I’ve used for installing/removing a comms device, and it’ll be great to see other Arai models get a similar treatment.    It has convenient cut-outs for speakers   The helmet is now ECE 22-06-compliant, and quality is at a typically high level with a beautiful paint finish, the most luxurious inner liner material you’ll ever come across and a solid, built-to-last feel in every component. As always, this helmet is an investment in a top-quality handmade product, and the prices match that. They currently start at a little under Rs 60,000 for plain colours in Europe and go up for graphics. You will save a significant amount if you shop from some Asian markets, but be aware that Arai’s shell shapes and sizes are different in these markets, so it’s crucial to try before you buy.    Where: araihelmet.eu   Price: Rs 64,000 (approx.)   Also see: Arai Tour-X4 helmet review",

    "description": "2011 RUF RT Roadster Location: Miami, Florida Original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: - Mileage: 6,900 miles Price: Call for Price   The Car | 1 of 1 RUF RT Roadster With a reputation for creating the pinnacle of bespoke performance sports cars, RUF can sometimes afford the luxury of creating one-off coach-built vehicles for close family friends and special clientele. The one-of-one RUF RT Roadster was the result of a unique idea presented by such a client to produce a true B-pillar Targa that hadn’t been available from Porsche from the 993 until the 991. This meant engineering a new body based on a 2011 997.2 chassis to create a Targa that would seamlessly combine nostalgia with the exhilarating driving feel RUF is so well known for. The team wanted to pay homage to the very first Targas produced which were famous for their ability to fully remove the rear window to provide a ‘soft window’ Targa experience. The RT Roadster reimagines the iconic rear quarter panel openings that feed the intercoolers, breathing cold air into the twin-turbo 3.8-liter flat-six that produces 650 horsepower delivered to all four wheels through a PDK transmission. Underneath rests a special RUF-tuned suspension and carbon ceramic brakes on all four corners. Finished in a truly bespoke Chromaflair satin paint, the lines of this RT Roadster flow as the paint transitions through its various layers of flake and its undertones are exposed. The interior is finished in contrasting red leather with silver stitching, extended carbon fiber accents, and painted Chromaflair satin interior trim, showcasing RUF's meticulous attention to detail. Factory options include phone connectivity, foldable carbon bucket seats, color-matching hard top panels, matching red leather luggage belts on the rear parcel shelf, and center lock wheels. The RT Roadster was unveiled at Rennsport VI in 2018 and subsequently featured in a MotorTrend article. It has been privately enjoyed by its original owner since then before being offered for sale to the general public. Continue...",

    "link": "",
    "description": "Photography by: Zach Brehl (@zachbrehl) 1986 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole (QV) Location: Toronto, Ontario Country of original delivery: Canada Chassis/VIN: GLA12978 Mileage: 25,334 kms (15,742 miles) Certification : Polo Storico Certification Price: Call for Price     The Car | The 1st nut-and-bolt restoration undertaken by Lamborghini As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer this highly storied, two-owner, factory-restored, US-specification 1986 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole. Believed to be the first nut-and-bolt restoration project ever undertaken by Lamborghini, years before the creation of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015, this Countach LP5000 QV represents a unique chapter in Lamborghini history. This 1986 Countach Quattrovalvole, finished in Rosso over Champagne with a Brown dashboard, was originally delivered on April 17, 1986, to a dealership called Autolynn in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. It was equipped with fuel injection to comply with North American emissions regulations and featured USA-specific bumpers. In the summer of 1988, the car was owned by a real estate agent who, after an afternoon drive, parked it in his driveway. Later that day, smoke began to emanate from the engine bay, ultimately igniting a fire that damaged the engine, body panels, and interior, scorching the seats and causing significant smoke damage. Deemed a write-off by the insurance company due to the scarcity and cost of replacement parts, the car seemed destined for obscurity—until the current custodian, a Canadian collector with a deep passion for the Countach, entered the picture. The search for parts was arduous. “I called every Lamborghini dealer in North America, faxed lists, and made countless calls, only to be told that parts were unavailable or would take months to arrive,” the owner recounted. “The factory had shifted focus to the new Diablo, making Countach components nearly impossible to find.” Then, an unexpected call came from a Toronto lawyer representing Lamborghini. The company, aware of his search through multiple inquiries across North America, wanted to inspect the salvaged parts. By 1989, he shipped the car to Milan. Lamborghini’s sales manager, Ubaldo Sgarzi, responded within a week of the car's arrival, confirming receipt and outlining plans to prepare an estimate for the restoration. With the production line for the Countach already dismantled, many parts had to be handmade or specially ordered from original suppliers. The extensive project took two and a half years and cost over USD $240,000— $30,000 more than the price of a new Diablo at the time. “The documentation is immense,” says the owner. Invoices, receipts, and correspondence attest to what was essentially a full rebuild. This restoration stands as a landmark: the first comprehensive restoration carried out by Lamborghini itself, years before the establishment of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015.   Continue...",

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-ax5-review-in-demand-433488#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Car+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options – an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox – priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) – to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. What’s missing is a variant badge on the boot.  Mahindra XUV 3XO AX5 interiors The interior retains the dual-tone colour scheme with the top half of the dashboard and door pads being black, and the lower half finished in white. While the dual colours elevate the cabin’s appeal and sense of space, its white areas get soiled very easily and warrant utmost care to keep clean. It doesn’t get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you won’t be left with a sweaty back on a hot day. The seats, however, are small, and occupants with large body frames will find these too snug for comfort. Also, the driver footwell is cramped, just like the other variants. The rear seat is a spacious and comfortable place, even for three adults. A space saver spare tyre beneath its floor has enabled Mahindra to liberate a bit more luggage space (compared to the XUV300), but the 3XO’s 295-litre boot is still small by segment standards, and its loading lip is high. Mahindra XUV 3XO AX5 equipment This variant gets a small, single-pane sunroof. As far as equipment goes, the AX5 variant gets twin 10.2-inch screens – one for the instrument cluster and one for the touchscreen – with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. It also gets a sunroof (single pane), a wireless charger, dual-zone climate control, auto LED headlamps, power-folding mirrors, rear air-con vents, a reversing camera, hill-start assist, 6 airbags and ESP, to name a few. Mahindra XUV 3XO AX5 performance Carried over from the outgoing XUV300 is the 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine that now makes 111hp and 200Nm. The good news is that despite being a three-cylinder unit, it is very smooth and refined. Compared to the TGDi direct-injection turbo-petrol unit (available in higher variants), this unit makes 20hp and 30Nm less, but we’re happy to report that in the real-world, this deficit hardly comes to light. .  It is quicker than its predecessor in both outright and rolling acceleration. It isn’t devoid of turbo lag, but once it is on boost – beyond 2,000rpm – it accelerates with a sense of urgency. Performance feels strongest and most effortless, in the 2,000-4,500rpm band. At 1,362kg, the XUV 3XO is heavy, but it still accelerates to 100kph from a standstill in a respectable 11.58 seconds. Interestingly, the 3XO’s outright as well as rolling acceleration times from 20-80kph in third gear and 40-100kph in fourth gear are much quicker than its predecessor. Performance dataXUV 3XO 1.2 Turbo MPFI 6MTXUV300 1.2 Turbo MPFI 6MT0-60kph5.07s5.29s0-100kph11.58s12.80s20-80kph (3rd gear)10.74s11.65s40-100kph (4th gear)13.38s13.96s In our fuel efficiency tests, the XUV 3XO turbo-petrol mated to a 6-speed manual returned 10.4kpl in the city and 14.9kpl on the highway. To keep a check on fuel consumption while idling, it gets an automatic engine stop-start function, too.   The XUV 3XO’s clutch is light but has a long travel. Also, while its 6-speed gearbox is smooth, its throws are too long and it doesn’t feel as slick as some of its Japanese or Korean rivals. Its steering feels effortless, and even though it gets adjustable steering modes that alter its weight and resistance, it doesn’t make it sportier or sharper.   Ride quality feels even better than the top-spec due to the AX5's higher profile tyres. Its ride and handling balance is spot on, but what further enhance the ride comfort are its high profile tyres (with 16-inch alloys). These absorb road shocks better than its higher variants that come equipped with 17-inch alloys. Mahindra XUV 3XO AX5 price and verdict Performance is so good, it makes you question the need to spend more for the TGDi version. The entry-level MPFI turbo-petrol’s performance and refinement are so good, it makes you question the need to spend more for the more powerful and advanced TGDi turbo-petrol engine. Sure, the latter is available in higher variants only and packs some premium features but despite being limited up to the mid AX5 variant, the MPFi engine gets more than just the mere basics. And for Rs 11 lakh, this AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol and manual transmission spells excellent value for money, which explains why it is in such high demand.

    "description": "F1 has announced a new 2025 season launch event where all 10 teams will unveil their livery on February 18, marking the start of the championship’s 75th anniversary year. Tickets will be available for fans to attend the event, which will be held at London’s The O2. F1 2025 launch event tickets go on sale on November 15 All 20 drivers will be present F1 2025 season launch tickets, livestream All 10 F1 teams will be unveiling their 2025 season liveries at the event. An official statement shared by F1 says the event will also feature interviews with key figures from the sport – including the drivers and team principals – as well as entertainment segments and special guest presenters. The event will take place on February 18 from 8pm-10pm GMT (1:30am-3:30am IST) and ticket prices range from £58 to £113 (around Rs 6,200-12,000). Tickets go on sale on Friday, November 15. For fans who can’t attend the event in person, there will also be a livestream. Further details on this will be revealed in the coming weeks. “For the first time we will bring together our fans, all 20 superstars of our sport and some very special guests to officially kick off our new season and mark our 75th year of racing,” said Stefano Domenicali, president and CEO of Formula 1. “With 2025 set to be a classic season following all the drama so far for 2024, this is a fantastic opportunity for fans of all ages to experience up-close the incredible entertainment spectacle that is Formula 1.” Will teams show their real cars? It is very unlikely that teams will showcase their final 2025 contenders at the event. 2025 F1 pre-season testing will take place from February 26-28 in Bahrain. Given that most teams will not want to give away any major secrets ahead of this, we can expect the launch event to largely feature show cars simply sporting the new liveries. But this has already been the case for several years now, with majority of the teams opting to share cleverly concealed renders or displaying show cars during their individual launch events. What about traditional F1 launches? This replaces the standard pre-season build-up where teams usually hold their own launch events across several weeks. However, F1 hasn’t confirmed whether this will be a permanent addition. For now, it’s simply been billed as a special event to celebrate the championship’s 75th anniversary.

    "description": "Having facelifted the Taycan line-up earlier this year, Porsche has now unveiled three new variants – the Taycan GTS sedan, Taycan GTS Sport Turismo and Taycan 4 sedan – thereby completing the range, which now comprises 16 variants in total. Porsche calls this new middle-rung GTS the “all-rounder” variant of the updated electric performance car. Taycan GTS variants use a 97kWh battery with 690hp Base Taycan sedan gets four-wheel drive for the first time Porsche Taycan GTS: range and specs Sitting between the 4S and the Turbo, the new Taycan GTS and GTS Sport Turismo variants are fitted with a 97kWh (usable) battery pack, which officially yields a range of 628km between charges – an improvement of about 120km. It now packs up to 700hp (when using the Launch Control function), an increase of 102hp over the old GTS, thanks to a new rear electric motor that makes 108hp and 40Nm more, yet weighs 10kg less. As such, the GTS’s 0-100kph sprint time is reduced by 0.4 seconds to 3.3 seconds. Porsche said the GTS also gets a specific suspension setup with a “particularly sporty edge”, although agility-boosting rear-wheel steering and the trick Active Ride system are optional extras. Porsche Taycan GTS: exterior and interior Visually, it’s distinguished by the ‘Sport’ front end from the base model and the 4S, and its air inlets are painted in a contrasting high-gloss black. The wheels, measuring either 20-inch or 21-inch, are available exclusively in Anthracite Grey. Inside, both GTS variants get 18-way adjustable bucket seats finished in the suede-like Race-Tex fabric, and the multi-function steering wheel from the range-topping Taycan Turbo GT is available as an option. These also receive a bespoke acceleration and deceleration soundtrack that’s said “to do justice to the exhilarating character of a GTS”. Porsche Taycan 4: what’s new? The Taycan’s base variant was so far only available in rear-wheel drive form, but the new Taycan 4 variant brings the all-wheel-drive configuration. In terms of performance, depending on whether it gets the standard Performance battery or the optional Performance Plus battery, the Taycan 4 can produce up to 408hp or 435hp when using Launch Control and has a certified range of up to 643km. The Taycan 4 takes 4.4 seconds to go from 0 to 100kph, 0.1 seconds faster than its rear-wheel-drive model sibling. Porsche Traction Management (PTM) and Adaptive Air Suspension with Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) are fitted as standard on the Taycan 4. All three models also benefit from the updates in terms of design and equipment, which Porsche introduced in the Taycan for the 2025 model year. All Taycan versions feature an even more extensive standard equipment list and come with the latest generation of the Porsche Driver Experience.
