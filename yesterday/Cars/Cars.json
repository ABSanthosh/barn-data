    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/alpina-has-revealed-its-final-standalone-car-now-what",
    "description": "Buchloe has been turning out belters since 1965 – but that run might now be ending We recently road tested Alpina’s new B3 Touring ‘GT’. You won’t be surprised to learn it’s quite a good motor car, but it also sounds a death knell for the outfit that makes it. On 31 December 2025, ownership of the brand will transfer from the Bovensiepens to the BMW Group, ending six decades of family-run status. There is a possibility that things will continue more or less as they are in terms of the product line-up, but it’s a slightly forlorn hope. The fact that Alpina insiders are referring to the B3 GT as ‘the last of the last’, and that the B8 GT revealed yesterday is packed with tributes to founder Burkard Bovensiepen, tells you everything you need to know. It’s rather an ominous sign for the man or woman who wants only – ha ha – for a 3 Series with Bentley-grade torque, effortless poise and a truly sumptuous cabin, all underwritten not by ‘oh, this rides pretty well for a 190mph car’ but genuine comfort and refinement. Rare, too. So what will happen, beyond already robust B3 residuals getting tungsten bracing? BMW has courted execs from luxury goods giant LMVH – with, one imagines, a view to launching Alpina into the limelight as a super-premium rival to Mercedes’ Maybach. That would be a world away from M, which should at least come as a relief to non-nerd BMW salespersons who have struggled to explain to puzzled visitors why the pinstriped car in the corner costs more than an M3 and they won’t be getting any sort of discount. Alpina never was that comprehensible to the casuals. So, rebooting the brand as a rival to Maybach and Bentley’s Mulliner arm. It would be a profit-driven enterprise far removed from Burkard Bovensiepen’s tangibly beneficial contributions to turbocharging and performance-diesel tech, not to mention his erudite interjections into the German political sphere. It would be for the 1% of the 1%. Which makes me wonder what room this approach leaves for 3 Series- and 5 Series-based models – the heartland of Alpina’s output for those who buy the cars to use them. In a Maybach-fighting scenario, only the vast 7 Series and X7 would be suitable conduits. They would have all the walnut trim an oligarch could wish for, but the detail engineering – which in the past has extended to Alpina recasting BMW engine blocks so that they might take an extra turbo – wouldn’t be necessary. Power? Sure, plenty. But ALP-marked bespoke rubber and minute tweaks to camber and torque distribution to give the dynamics additional lustre? Seems unlikely. All of which is to say, if you have ever hankered after a factory-fresh Alpina of the trad school, get it now. In fact, a couple of months ago was the ideal time, if you want all the bells and whistles. A full Lavalina leather interior runs to about £14k, which is why it’s rare to see it on anything less than a B7. However, with the potential imminent demise of the B3 and B5, people are going full Sultan of Brunei and ticking every box in sight. There has duly been a run on Lavalina, and since the saddlery in Buchloe can only upholster five interiors each month (an XB7 cabin represents around 120 hours of work), it has now been taken off the menu. So yes, there is a waiting list for having your rear armrest trimmed in the hide of some of the most pampered livestock on the planet, with its ‘cloth-like’ softness. Such is the quirky world of Alpina. As for why the Bovensiepens are getting out, Alpinas are all about ‘no compromise’, which is currently incompatible with EV tech. Andreas Bovensiepen has also said that hiring good software engineers would be ruinously expensive, and they would be crucial if Alpina were to continue differentiating itself from BMW on an engineering level. With the brand equity at an all-time high, now is a sensible time to offload. It really is the end of an era, and as Autocar’s resident Alpina tragic, I find it so sad. Still, there have been some excellent moments. A D3 S to Turin and back at 40-something-mpg and an unprintable average speed; a B3 from Munich to London in one hit; the elderly chap near Liège who stopped in his tracks at the sight of the B4 S I’d parked up: “Woah, a genuine Al-pee-naah!” My old B4 S long-termer was the one I fell hard for. I can remember travelling to Buchloe in 2018 to collect it, my wife joining the trip. We landed late and a techie from the factory was generous enough to shuttle us from the airport. At a steady 220kph, he asked if we would share the driving home. I said probably not, because Charlotte hadn’t driven in 10 years. He glanced at her over his shoulder, turned back to the road, nodded and in Arnie-accented English agreed that it would be “like putting a baby in a Eurofighter”. Gold.",

    "description": "New look includes LED light bars front and rear Images posted to online forums reveal a more aggressive look in line with the new Tiguan The first photos of the next-generation Volkswagen T-Roc have been leaked online ahead of its official reveal, which is expected to take place later this year. The pictures, which appear to have been taken from a prototype’s infotainment or instrument screens, reveal it to be a more aggressive-looking proposition than the current T-Roc. It gets a more prominent front grille, slimmer headlights and large aero disc-style wheels, plus LED light bars at the front and rear ends. The look brings the T-Roc into line with the new Passat, Tiguan and Golf launched last year. It is also expected to share much of its technical make-up with those cars, most likely using the same MQB Evo platform and their petrol, diesel and hybrid powertrains.  The Golf, for example, is offered with powerplants that range from a turbocharged 1.5-litre petrol four-pot to a 2.0-litre diesel four with 114bhp. This could also pave the way for the T-Roc to receive its first plug-in hybrid powertrain. The Golf’s set-up pairs the 1.5-litre petrol unit with a 19.7kWh (usable capacity) battery and a 107bhp e-motor for a combined 201bhp and 88 miles of electric range. Hybridising a popular model – the T-Roc was VW’s second best-selling SUV last year, and SUVs accounted for 47% of its total 4.8 million sales – would surely help the firm to comply with stricter fleet emissions targets that come into effect in Europe from this year. These require a manufacturer’s total car sales for the year to average emissions of 93.6g/km of CO2, down from the 95g/km requirement of the past five years. The existing T-Roc’s powertrains all emit well more than 100g/km, whereas the Golf eHybrid PHEV is rated at just 6g/km. An electric version is not expected to be offered, despite Volkswagen having previously trademarked the ID Roc name. This gap in the brand’s line-up is instead expected to be filled by an upcoming model that is based on a development of the ID 3’s MEB platform and is due in 2026. The new T-Roc will be revealed in the coming months and UK deliveries are expected to start before the end of the year.  Prices are expected to rise slightly compared with those of the current car, which starts at £29,045. A spokesperson for VW declined to comment on the new T-Roc.",

    "description": "The uncomfortable truth about custom motorcycles is that for every good one built, there are dozens of bad ones. All too often you’ll come across custom bikes that have been crudely cobbled together with no regard for good taste—or safety, even. This 1999 Moto Guzzi California was one such bike, until Massimo Rinchiuso rescued it. “The California was previously customized using poorly matched parts, with many malfunctioning parts and poorly made modifications,” says Massimo, who runs Fuchs Workshop as a one-man band in the vibrant city of Ravenna, in Italy’s Emilia-Romagna region. “The bike was not only really ugly but also potentially dangerous.” Massimo’s client is a long-walks-on-the-beach guy, so the Moto Guzzi’s torque twin-cylinder motor suits him well. He handed the bike over to Massimo to make it not only beautiful to look at, but usable and safe, too.…",

It was constructed and piloted by a German privateer named Helmut Fath, and spawned the next generation of sidecar racers known as ‘kneelers.’ A holy combination of old parts and new ideas, Helmut Fath’s BMW RS sidecar was pivotal to his rise to prominence in sidecar racing and his historic toppling of BMW’s championship reign Born in Ursenbach on May 24, 1929, Helmut Fath followed in his father’s footsteps with an immediate interest in motorcycles.

    "description": "Few cars boast brand equity as strong as the Hyundai Creta. This formidable midsize SUV has long dominated its segment, thanks to its well-rounded packaging, feature-rich appeal and diverse powertrain options. Now, Hyundai has taken the winning Creta formula and electrified it, giving rise to the Creta Electric. The big question is if this battery-powered version can replicate the success of its internal combustion engine (ICE) counterpart. The Creta Electric is built on the ICE platform, but it has undergone significant reworking to accommodate its electric powertrain. The cabin floor sits slightly higher to make room for the battery pack, the suspension has been stiffened to handle the additional weight, and the front wheels are powered by an electric motor. Despite these changes, the Creta Electric retains the dimensions of its ICE sibling, including an impressive 200mm (unladen) ground clearance. An \"electric\" badge on the bootlid and pixelated accents on the bumper set this version apart from its ICE counterpart.   Hyundai Creta Electric exterior In terms of design, the Creta Electric takes inspiration from the Creta N Line, particularly at the front. The enclosed grille, featuring a pixelated theme reminiscent of the Ioniq 5, incorporates a centrally placed charging port. This pixelated motif extends to the closed front air dam, which includes active flaps to enhance aerodynamic efficiency. The 17-inch aero-style alloy wheels further emphasise its EV identity, and they come wrapped in lowrolling resistance, EV-specific tyres. Adding to its aesthetic appeal are silver highlights on the lower edges of the black plastic cladding, creating a striking contrast. Our dual-tone test unit featured black pillars, a black roof, and a black rear spoiler for added flair. Unique identifiers, such as an \"electric\" badge on the bootlid and pixelated accents on the rear bumper, set this version apart from its ICE counterpart. The sight of its battery pack beneath its body looks a bit ungainly, especially when viewed from the sides. Flaps on the front air dam automatically open and close to improve aerodynamic efficiency.   Hyundai Creta Electric interior Step into the Creta Electric’s cabin, and you’ll immediately notice its resemblance to the ICE version. However, several EV-specific upgrades make it distinct. A notable addition is the all-new three-spoke steering wheel with a circular horn boss, adorned with four dots symbolising the letter ‘H’ in Morse code. Interestingly, the steering buttons have been rearranged – the infotainment and phone controls are now on the right, while ADAS functions are on the left. New three-spoke steering wheel with a circular horn boss; four dots symbolise the letter ‘H’ in Morse code. The familiar 10.25-inch instrument cluster now features an additional cube-like theme, akin to the Ioniq 5. The air conditioning console – borrowed from the updated Alcazar – combines infotainment shortcuts with touch-sensitive keys, although practical physical toggles for temperature and a volume knob remain. A standout addition is the steering column-mounted drive selector, reminiscent of the Ioniq 5. This design frees up the centre console, which now adopts a floating style. It houses a drive mode button, an electric parking brake, an auto-hold button, ventilated front seat controls, and dual cupholders. Impressively, there’s a lower deck area beneath it which houses a fair bit of storage space. Even the armrest console is huge, and like the glovebox, it features a cooling vent to keep beverages cool. Lower deck area beneath the centre console houses a fair bit of storage space. In line with Hyundai’s sustainable focus, the seats are upholstered in eco-friendly materials derived from corn extracts and recycled plastic bottles. Surprisingly, the texture is smooth and closely resembles the leatherette used in the ICE model. The slightly higher floor impacts the driving position, which feels elevated even at its lowest setting. While rear seat space remains unchanged and is comfortable, the seating postureis slightly knees-up. A new boss-function allows rear passengers to electronically slide the front passenger seat forward, enhancing legroom. Utility trays on the front seatbacks include grooves for mobile devices and integrated pop-open cupholders for added convenience. You're seated in a slightly knees-up position, although it isn't uncomfortable. Additionally, the Creta Electric features a V2L (Vehicle-to-Load) system with a 3-pin power socket, enabling users to power devices like laptops or small appliances. Storage capacity remains practical with the unchanged 433-litre boot, complete with a spare tire under the boot floor. A 22-litre frunk provides extra loading space beneath the bonnet. 433-litre boot remains just as practical as the ICE version; gets a spare tyre beneath the floor, too.   Hyundai Creta Electric features Besides carrying forward the ICE version’s feature-set, the Electric gets some new equipment too, like rain-sensing wipers, electric front seats with driver’s seat memory, a cooling central console, boss seat function as well as front seatback-mounted utility trays. It carries forward the Autonomous Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) suite, which, like in the standard Creta, adds a safety net without feeling too intrusive in its function. Familiar 10.25-inch instrument cluster gets new cube-like display theme. Hyundai has invested heavily in developing an in-car payments option, which, with a mere touch, facilitates a wallet-based payment for vehicle charging, as well as future subscription-based features. In addition, the company has developed a first-of-its-kind mobile application through which users can not only identify and navigate to over 10,000 EV chargers across different brands but also make payments via the app to certain service providers. This eliminates the hassle of downloading and registering on multiple brand-specific applications. We’re still sore that like the standard Creta, it misses out on things like wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, adjustable front armrest, a headrest for the middle rear passenger, and the volume of its 8-speaker Bose setup is much lower at the rear than in the front. Also, compared to the large screens of its competitors, the Creta Electric’s 10.25-inch touchscreen comes across as a bit small. A new boss-function allows rear passengers to electronically slide the front passenger seat forward, enhancing legroom.   Hyundai Creta Electric performance The Creta Electric is offered with two battery options: a 42kWh pack and a 51.4kWh Long Range pack. Both utilise Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) cell chemistry, similar to the Ioniq 5. This type of battery is more compact and energy-dense than Lithium Ferrous Phosphate (LFP) batteries, although LFP batteries are known for their longer lifespan. For added peace of mind, Hyundai offers an 8-year/1,60,000km warranty on the battery, alongside the standard 3-year warranty on the car. The sight of its battery pack from the side looks a bit ungainly. Powering the Creta Electric is a single motor on the front axle that drives the front wheels. In the Long Range variant, this motor produces 171hp and 255Nm. Interestingly, its torque matches the diesel variant's 250Nm and is close to the turbo-petrol's 260Nm. However, being an EV, the power delivery is strong yet exceptionally linear. Acceleration feels brisk and effortless, even in its most efficient ‘Eco’ mode. The three drive modes – Eco, Normal and Sports – deliver noticeably different responses to part-throttle inputs, while flooring the accelerator unleashes the motor’s full potential. A synthesised bassy hum under hard acceleration adds a touch of drama to the otherwise silent drive. In our tests, the Creta Electric managed a 0-100kph time of 8.2 seconds, slightly behind the claimed 7.9 seconds. Flat out, it can achieve a top speed of 180kph. Acceleration feels brisk and effortless, but real-world range of over 400km impresses. The Creta gets a total of five regenerative braking options, with Level 1, 2 and 3 adjusting deceleration and bringing the car to a crawl.While these modes are mild, Levels 4 and 5 are strong. Drivers can also disable regenerative braking entirely for a free-rolling experience or opt for the ‘i-Pedal’ mode, which allows one-pedal driving by bringing the car to a complete stop without using the brake pedal. Each mode feels distinct and natural, making them intuitive to use. Adaptive cruise control integrates seamlessly with the regen system, adjusting braking automatically based on the situation, though drivers can override this using steering-mounted paddle shifters. Hyundai Creta Electric range and charging The 42kWh battery variant has an ARAI-certified range of 390km, while the 51.4kWh Long Range version offers 473km. In a mixed driving cycle of city and highway conditions, our preliminary test of the Long Range variant returned an impressive real-world range of approximately 426km. For reference, our 289.6km drive at an average speed of 41kph toggling through different drive and regenerative braking settings, utilised 68 percent of the charge. Charging port behind the enclosed front grille gets an LED indicator. Hyundai claims the battery can be charged from 10 to 80 percent in just 58 minutes using a 50kW DC fast charger. With a 11kW AC charger, the larger battery charges fully (10 to 100 percent) in 4 hours and 50 minutes, while the smaller battery completes this in 4 hours. Hyundai Creta Electric ride and handling To support the additional weight of the battery and motor, the Creta Electric’s suspension is stiffer than the ICE version’s. Remarkably, it doesn’t translate into a crashy or uncomfortable ride experience. Yes, you can feel its firmness at low speeds, and you’ll also hear its suspension ‘thwack’ over sharp bumps (particularly due to an otherwise silent cabin), but road shocks are still well in check. What’s nice is that the stiffness has eliminated unnecessary (secondary) body movements, and even at highway speeds, the Creta Electric doesn’t lose its poise. The steering, too, is noticeably heavier than the ICE version’s, and as a result, it warrants more effort at slow and parking speeds. But at no point does it feel excessive or cumbersome. And while it hasn’t resulted in more feel or feedback per se, the added weight only adds to the driver’s confidence, especially at high speeds or around a series of bends. Also nice is that the Creta Electric changes directions well, and with its weight being concentrated lower down, body roll seems to be far better controlled than the petrol-version. Notably, the Electric’s braking is so good, the transition from regenerative to frictional brakes feels extremely smooth and superbly calibrated, thus lending to a very natural brake pedal feel. Hyundai Creta Electric verdict The Creta Electric has its flaws – the ride is stiffer than the ICE version’s; the steering is a bit weighty; and finally, its floor is a bit raised, which results in a slightly knees-up position. But none of these are a dealbreaker. A standout addition is the steering column-mounted drive selector, akin to the Ioniq 5. The Electric version still retains the ICE’s brilliant packaging like its spacious cabin, ample practicality, and a decently sized boot – it gets a frontal loading area (frunk), too. Performance is smooth, linear and reasonably quick. But what’s even more impressive is its real-world range of over 400km, with reasonable charging times. And even though its suspension is firmer than the ICE Creta’s, it gets a newfound confidence in the ride and handling department. Typical to the Creta’s proposition, this electric iteration is feature-rich, too. At an expected price ranging between Rs 17 lakh and Rs 23 lakh, the Creta Electric comes across as a fantastic EV. Will it replicate the ICE's success? If first impressions are anything to go by, the Creta Electric seems to have what it takes to dominate the EV space.

    "description": "Hyundai showcased the Staria premium EV at Auto Expo 2025 on Friday (January 17). Do note that the company has no immediate plans to launch it in India, but it is using the event to gauge customer interest. The Staria is a large, almost van-like premium MPV that has been available in international markets since 2021. It has various seating configurations, even featuring four rows for up to 11 people. The model showcased at the Auto Expo, however, was a more premium 7-seater version. The Staria was showcased at the Auto Expo with a 3.5-litre V6 engine Gets a 7-seater configuration with second-row captain chairs The Staria shares its underpinnings with the Kia Carnival MPV The Staria stretches the tape at over 5.2 metres and is shaped like a typical people mover, although a low beltline with a large glasshouse gives it a distinctive look. The face has a swooping design, with a black contrasting finish on the bumper, which houses a large mesh grille and rectangular pixel headlamps. In typical MPV fashion, the profile is slab-sided, while at the rear, it gets large vertical tail-lamps, again with pixel detailing like the front. Inside, the Staria features a vertically oriented central touchscreen with plenty of physical buttons on a panel below. The cabin also boasts a free-standing instrument cluster, a four-spoke steering wheel, and a flat floor, which aids free movement within the cabin despite being an ICE-powered vehicle. The real highlight, however, is the second-row captain’s chairs, which are powered and come with a ventilation function. The third-row seats get a bench configuration. The Staria shares its underpinning with the Kia Carnival, which is already on sale in India. Internationally, it’s available with a range of petrol and diesel engines, but the one showcased at the Auto Expo comes with a 3.5-litre V6 engine that produces 272hp and 331Nm of torque. The engine comes mated to an 8-speed automatic gearbox, driving the front wheels. Hyundai has also launched the Creta Electric at the Auto Expo with prices starting from Rs 17.99 lakh (ex-showroom).

    "description": "The new Skoda Kodiaq has made its India debut at the Auto Expo 2025, ahead of its scheduled market launch later this year. Skoda India has also displayed the Elroq mid-size electric SUV and the Vision 7S SUV concept at the event. The new Kodiaq continues with a 2.0-litre petrol engine The Elroq sits below the Enyaq iV SUV in Skoda’s line-up The Vision 7S concept previews the future Skoda SUVs New Skoda Kodiaq India launch by June 2025 As we reported earlier, the new Kodiaq will go on sale in the April-June quarter this year. Skoda has the top-spec Kodiaq L\u0026K on display at the Auto Expo. The SUV has been undergoing road tests in India for the past few months, and spy shots have hinted at more than one variant being readied for the India launch. Skoda’s flagship SUV continues to use the 2.0-litre petrol engine, delivering 190hp and mated to a 7-speed DCT gearbox. Higher variants will come with 4X4 tech at launch. The new Kodiaq is slightly larger than the outgoing model and gets Skoda’s “Modern Solid” design language. Now longer than before, the SUV offers more interior space and higher boot capacity. We expect the brand to offer the new Kodiaq in India with a 7-seater layout. Key features include a 13-inch infotainment screen, a fully digital instrument cluster and additional safety tech, such as a Level 2 ADAS suite. Expect the new Kodiaq to be slightly higher in price than the outgoing one, which starts at Rs 39.99 lakh (ex-showroom, India). Skoda Elroq EV is here to gauge customer response Apart from the Kodiaq, the Elroq electric SUV is on display at the show, making its India debut. While Skoda has not confirmed whether it will launch the Elroq in India, it has brought the electric SUV to the expo to gauge customer response. The Elroq is underpinned by the Volkswagen Group’s MEB architecture, which is also used by the Audi Q4 and Volkswagen ID.3, among others. It has been stretched to 4.49 metres, making it slightly larger than the ICE-powered Karoq (4.39 metres) but significantly smaller than the Enyaq (4.65 metres). The Elroq sits below the flagship Enyaq iV in Skoda’s global line-up and gets three battery pack options, with outputs ranging from 170hp to 285hp. Skoda India is considering bringing the Elroq here, and if launched, it will find itself in the company of the Tata Curvv EV, the upcoming Hyundai Creta Electric, and the Maruti e Vitara, among others. Vision 7S concept previews future Skoda SUVs The Vision 7S concept from Skoda is not all-new. It debuted in 2022 as Skoda’s demonstrator, hinting at the design and tech for its future models. The concept previewed many firsts for Skoda, including its new logo and the “Modern Solid” design language. A 7-seater SUV based on this concept is set to make it to production by 2026. While the all-new SUV based on the Vision 7S isn’t out yet, some of the styling cues from the concept are already visible on the Elroq electric SUV. The concept also features very cool suicide doors, although it is unlikely to make it to production on any model.  Apart from the exterior, the Vision 7S concept also previews a new look for the cabin, where the steering wheel and central boss design are oval-shaped, the interiors are clean and devoid of buttons, and the car also gets a large central touchscreen that can be used in portrait or landscape position, similar to what we see on the BYD models. The showcar had typical concept-like interiors with individual seats for four passenger, a center console that cuts through the entire length of the cabin and also very interesting textures on the floor board and door pads.  Besides the new Kodiaq, the Elroq and the Vision 7S concept, Skoda India has also displayed the new Superb and the Octavia RS at the motor show.
