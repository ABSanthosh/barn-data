    "description": "Before I start telling you about this unique-looking bag, I have a confession to make: I have organisational OCD and am a creature of habit. I can’t stand disarray of any sort when it comes to packing my belongings, and the way I pack follows the saying – ‘a place for everything, and everything in its place.’ That’s why the Kriega Sling Pro Messenger Bag fits neatly into my life and has become my go-to bag for nearly everything over the past four months, from daily commutes to weekend trips and even shopping. Main pocket is quite deep. This bag is divided into three main compartments comprising an absolutely waterproof main compartment that holds seven litres, accompanied by two ancillary zippered ones that can hold a total of another seven. While seven litres may sound small, I have been able to fit two boxes containing my office lunch, a couple of t-shirts, and a 1-litre water bottle, with quite some room to spare. Kriega claims you can fit a 14-inch laptop into this compartment, but I’ve fit my colleague’s 15-inch one without hassle. Waist belt helps reduce load on your shoulder. Then, there are the two secondary zippered pockets, one larger than the other. Both appear quite slim at first glance, but as you’ll discover, this small bag is capable of holding much more than you think. The larger zippered pocket can hold a thick 500-page novel, a 750ml water bottle, a chunky power bank and my phone charger. In the smaller one, I usually have my old-fashioned leather wallet, sunscreen, a spare pair of spectacles, my Bluetooth earphones and house keys. As is evident, if you’re meticulous about how you pack your things, the Messenger Pro can swallow a lot. Total 14 litres of storage available. Since this is a sling bag, you get one main strap, which you sling across your torso, and anyone who has worn one will tell you that it can get a little uncomfortable on its own after some time. Thankfully, Kriega has also supplied a sturdy waist belt that alleviates most of the pressure from your shoulder. I’ve worn this bag all day for multiple days in a row, and I’m happy to report that you don’t feel any discomfort for the first 5-6 hours. After that, you will start to feel some soreness, but you can always reverse the strap’s mounting to the other side and sling it on the opposite shoulder. At Rs 15,799, the Kriega Sling Pro Messenger Bag is unquestionably a luxurious indulgence. That holds true even in the Kriega context because there are other similarly priced or more affordable backpacks from the same company that are more versatile, spacious and can even be equipped with a hydration bladder. So, to answer the all-important question: to buy or not to buy? The thing is, you’ve got to particularly want this form factor. I can confirm that it works well in an urban context while also being a bit of a unique style statement from a motorcycling perspective. But, if that’s not a particular priority, and if this is your first step into the world of Kriega, you will find some more versatile personal luggage-carrying options.

    "description": "CS can hit 62mph from a standstill 0.1sec quicker than standard M3 Touring Track-focused version of hot estate goes on a diet and gets an extra 19bhp from its straight six The BMW M3 CS Touring has been revealed as an even hotter, track-focused version of the brand’s smaller performance estate, bringing extra power and a significant reduction in weight. By replacing the bonnet, front splitter, front air intakes, side mirror caps and rear diffuser with carbonfibre components, BMW has shed some 15kg from the M3 Touring, bringing its kerb weight down from 1865kg to 1850kg. Meanwhile, the output of its 3.0-litre straight six has been increased from 523bhp to 542bhp, thanks in large part to an increase in turbocharger boost pressure from 1.7bar to 2.1bar.  The tweaks mean the CS can complete the 0-62mph sprint in 3.5sec – 0.1sec less than the standard M3 Competition Touring. Its top speed is also improved by 12mph, to 186mph. As well as extra grunt, the CS gets firmer suspension and a pair of cast-aluminium strut braces up front, boosting rigidity. Completing the package is a range of styling tweaks, ranging from yellow LED daytime running lights – now a signature of BMW’s CS cars – to light-up ‘CS’ logos on the carbonfibre-backed bucket seats. The CS is said to be a limited-run proposition, although specific production numbers – either globally or for the UK – have yet to be confirmed. Prices start at £120,600 and the first examples are scheduled to arrive in the UK from March.",

    "description": "Track-day special still occupies a unique position in the market, as a wonderful circuit and road car There might not be a more sought-after performance derivative anywhere else in motordom than the Porsche 911 GT3.The model was almost an afterthought when it made its debut on the 996-generation 911 in 1999. But on every update of 911 since then it has been a penned-in performance model, intended to be at home on a race circuit as it is on the road, and able to go from one to the other with nothing more than a cursory check of the fuel level. Porsches are kind on consumables even when driven really hard.Here comes the latest version, the mid life revision or in Porsche geek-speak the ‘.2’ update of the 992 generation 911, which arrived in January 2025.If you can’t spot much difference from the model that arrived in 2021, don’t be alarmed, there are vast numbers of small details that have been changed under the skin, and as we’ll see, they keep the GT3 in a unique position in the automotive sphere.",

His shop, Kaffeemaschine, focuses solely on classic Moto Guzzi models, turning them into elegant machines that are impossibly cool, highly refined, and built to be ridden. Based in Hamburg, Germany, Kaffeemaschine recently buttoned up this monochromatic charmer for a client who wanted one of the workshop’s signature GT tourer builds, but with a few twists. “He wanted a Kaffeemaschine GT, but a little more in the direction of a scrambler,” Axel explains. “And he wanted most of it black.” Further to those requirements, Axel’s client asked that the donor bike be the same age as him—so Kaffeemaschine sourced a 1979 Moto Guzzi Le Mans II. With the Le Mans on the bench and an established template to work from, the crew turned their attention to their customer’s most challenging requested… “The biggest issue was the fuel tank, as he wanted a different design,” says Axel.…",

    "description": "It’s no secret that the small car segment has steadily been declining over the past few years. In FY24, small cars or hatchbacks were 27.6 percent of the market. This year, the figure has further dropped to 23.2 percent. However, Tarun Garg, COO of Hyundai Motor India, feels that this segment is still very crucial for first-time car buyers and fleet operators, where sales are primarily driven by the CNG variants. CNG variants make up for about 20 percent of Nios’ sales In the case of the Aura, CNG variants comprise more than 90 percent of sales The company attributes the steep rise in sales to the dual-cylinder tech “Every year, we feel it is bottoming out, and then every year it reaches a new bottom,” said Garg at the company’s Q3 FY25 press conference. The company, however, is still keen on this segment. “We are using the small car platform not only to get first-time buyers but also for CAFE norms compliance,” added Garg. Hyundai Grand i10 Nios and Aura CNG sales “The Grand i10 Nios with CNG is going very strong, and the dual-cylinder layout is helping us get the numbers. Even the Aura and Exter are benefitting that way. We saw the highest-ever CNG contribution of 13.1 percent during the calendar year 2024,” said Garg. Hyundai says the Nios CNG saw a sales increase from 16 percent in Q1 to 19.5 percent in Q2, reaching 20.3 percent in Q3. The Aura CNG sales also saw a similar trend, rising from 86.5 percent in Q1 to 89.8 percent in Q2 and 92 percent in Q3. “We are also enhancing our rural presence by actively expanding our network to better serve these markets. The trend is very clear that it's going to go up,\" Garg said. In the ongoing financial year, the overall CNG penetration surged from 13.7 percent in Q1 to 25.3 percent in Q2, followed by a further jump to 36.5 percent in Q3. Hyundai’s dip in small car sales For Hyundai Motor India, the small car penetration was at 22.9 percent in FY24, but in this financial year –in the period between April-December – it has fallen to 20.2 percent. “I think the thing is that the customers’ purchasing power and aspirations have gone up, and they are not willing to compromise. They want a minimum level of comfort and convenience,” explained Garg.

    "description": "Even as KTM AG is navigating its way out of a tough financial crisis, the Indian arm of the company (owned and managed wholly by Bajaj) remains unaffected. In fact, KTM India is seeing strong demand for two recently updated models: the 200 Duke and 250 Duke. 200 Duke and 250 Duke are seeing good traction KTM India remains unaffected by global debt There are 440 KTM dealers across India Our sister publication, Autocar Professional, had the opportunity to talk to Rakesh Sharma, ED of Bajaj Auto, about KTM’s operations in India amid the parent company’s financial woes.  “There has been no impact on our domestic business. KTM products sold in India are manufactured locally in Chakan and distributed through our network of 440 dealers. In fact, KTM has had an exceptional quarter, its best ever, with the refreshed Duke 200 and Duke 250 – launched in October – performing exceptionally well. Both models continue to see strong demand,\" said Sharma. “We have felt an impact on exports. Previously, we manufactured lower CC products for KTM, which KTM distributed to their international markets. This export volume has significantly decreased. Last year, it was about 6,500 units per month. In Q3, it dropped to around 3,500 monthly units, constituting approximately 6 percent of our exports last year. In Q3 of this year, it fell to 3 percent. Exports are on hold and will only resume once the situation becomes clearer after February 25th.” To read the full interview, you can tap HERE.

    "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJDrjdXmFeI Dave will be the first one to tell you his ’67 Shelby GT350 isn’t period correct. But when it comes to ticking the boxes of what truly matters, concours rules don’t even make the list. This car is more than a restoration; it’s the embodiment of perseverance, sacrifice, and a vision he held onto for decades. As a teenager, Dave watched the GT350 roll past his gas station, driven by a Vietnam veteran who had bought it brand new. To Dave, it wasn’t just a car; it was a rolling symbol of freedom and individuality. He knew, deep down, it would be his someday. That day came in 1973 when, after a few changes of ownership, he finally made the dream a reality. As it inevitably tends to do, life came by and happened. Marriage, family, and the responsibilities of adulthood meant the GT350 got pushed off to the back of his mind. Still, Dave never let go of the vision he had when he disassembled the car in 1976. Thirty years later, with his family’s support, he finally turned his attention back to the car, not to build a concours queen but to create something deeply personal.  “This car is not necessarily period correct.” Dave says, “It's not a concours car, but it's a hell of a machine because I built it the way I want it.” It took two years of bodywork, engine rebuilds, and assembly. He meticulously archived every bolt and part, documenting every detail as he blended authentic elements with personal touches to craft a machine that fulfills the longing he felt all those years ago watching it cruise by the station. Plenty of people want a factory-spec restoration, a polished time capsule built to live on manicured grass instead of asphalt. Instead Dave built something that embodies everything he values most: hard work, sacrifice, family, and the passion to see something through, no matter how long it takes. It’s not correct by concours standards, but it’s real by every measure that counts. For Dave, that’s all it ever needed to be. Continue...",

    "description": "The attraction to automobiles does not always pertain entirely to a physical quality. Sure, a car’s design, or its smell, or its sound can be part of that attraction, but a bigger part lies within something more abstract. If there was ever anyone who could relate to such an emotion, it would be Rob Simon. His steed of choice has been, and always will be, the legendary BMW E30 M3. In the automotive space, the legendary Bavarian warrior needs no introduction or backstory. It has long been heralded as one of the most exceptional machines ever sculpted by mankind, offering a pure driving experience unmarred by unnecessary aids or features. Despite a near-death experience in his red E30 M3, Rob always lusted for another one. It wasn’t just the behind-the-wheel time he longed for but the deeper, unspoken connection it wove between him, his father, and his brother, all of which had E30 M30s of their own. That chance would thankfully arise once more, but not in the way he would expect. Tune in to the Petrolicious YouTube channel and relive Rob Simon’s BMW E30 M3 tale alongside us. Maybe bring some tissues along for the ride, too. Continue...",
