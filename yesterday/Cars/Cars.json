    "description": "This 1953 Alfa Romeo 1900C Sprint is one of approximately 100 examples constructed with Pinin Farina coupe coachwork between 1952 and 1953. Chassis 01534 is noted to have undergone refurbishment work in Sweden in the mid-1990s before being exported to Japan. It later spent time in a Northern California collection and was the recipient of a mechanical refresh beginning in the late 2000s that included an overhaul of its twin-cam inline-four to a displacement of 1,975cc before changing hands via the selling dealer in 2014 and again in 2018. The car was purchased by a prior owner in 2020, and subsequent service involved a correction of its red paint along with a re-trim of its black leather interior. After being listed on BaT in October 2023, the car was fitted with a replacement steering box. Other modifications include a floor-shifted five-speed manual transmission, twin Weber carburetors, an oil cooler, an electric fuel pump, an electric cooling fan, updated front suspension components, bolstered seats, and exhaust cut-outs. It rides on 16” Borrani wire wheels and is further equipped with finned aluminum drum brakes, Marchal fog lamps, and a Nardi wood-rimmed steering wheel. This 1900C is now offered on dealer consignment at no reserve with service records, a tool kit, a handheld Marchal spot lamp, and a clean California title.",

    "description": "After Ather debuted Magic Twist and traction control on the 450 Apex, they trickled down to the family-centric Rizta. Now, the company has endowed the 450X with the same, and also peppered it with other small changes. Ather 450X changes for 2025, new features Unlike the Rizta, where the systems are simply on or off, the ones on the 450X are adjustable. Magic Twist has two levels – Low and High – while traction control has three – Rain, Road and Rally – and both can be turned off entirely as well. Both TC and Magic Twist can be switched off entirely. I’ve been using Magic Twist on our Rizta long-termer for a few months now, and I find it to be a useful, intuitive feature on my commutes. I think the adjustability of this feature on the 450X only exemplifies its usefulness. In chock-a-block traffic, I preferred to leave the Magic Twist in Low, which helped reduce the aggressiveness of the regen. It was still effective enough to bring the scooter to a halt without using the brakes.  The Magic Twist has also brought with it an added bonus – a big claimed increased range. For the 2.9kWh 450X variant, Ather claims that TrueRange has gone up from 85km to 105km, and that of the 3.7kWh variant has seen an even larger increment, from 105km to 130km. In the short time frame of this first ride experience, we weren’t able to put these claims to the test, so we’ll reserve our judgement until we can conduct a thorough road test in Mumbai.  Some of the aforementioned range increase is also attributed to the new Zapper N e-tred tyres, co-developed by both MRF and Ather. Ather claims these tyres have lower rolling resistance, thereby helping increase the scooter’s range. The company also claims that there’s a minuscule trade-off in grip, but it’s nothing I felt during my time with the 450X. Visually, these are identical to the earlier MRF Zapper tyres and have the exact same tread pattern; the difference lies purely in how they are constructed. New tyres help increase range, look the same. When it comes to traction control, I found myself leaving the scooter in Rally mode for almost the entirety of my time with it. Rally allows a fair bit of slip on loose surfaces before it reins the scooter in, letting you have fun while keeping you safe. Even when I was riding in Warp mode over some properly rough surfaces, it worked smoothly in the background. The other two modes are more cautious, for those of you who don’t like getting ‘Swayze’ every now and then. The final change is the obvious one: new colours. You’ve got this bold Hyper Sand option as well as a more subtle Stealth Blue option. The former is reserved just for the 450X, while the latter can be optioned even on the 450S.  The discreet belt drive cover looks neat, goes with the 450X's aesthetic. The 450X has always been a sleek, sharp-looking thing, and a small update that Ather has made in the recent past, which may have flown under the radar, is the new belt drive cover. It is ultra-sleek and not bulky like the Rizta’s. Ather 450X handling, issues we faced Beyond that, the 450X is the same as it’s always been. That means it’s still the same energetic, eager, and properly zippy thing that we’ve come to know and love over the past seven years.  Experiencing the 450X at the tight Aruani Grid go-kart track made me remember what a fun machine this is! It is by far one of the sharpest and most fun scooters in the market today, price notwithstanding.   Yes, it is still a little tight for taller folks, and its stiff ride quality is not very pleasant over bad roads – something available in abundance in our country.  The one additional gripe I have with the updated 450X is that locking up the rear wheel has become easier than before, with Magic Twist working hand-in-glove with the sharp rear disc. Riding it on Bombay’s slippery, gravel-ridden concrete roads is one additional concern I foresee.  Ather 450X price, verdict Ather’s software update for the 450X has given it some useful features and additional range, which is always welcome.  The price increase varies from variant to variant, ranging between Rs 2,000 and Rs 6,400. The biggest hike has actually gone to the 450X 2.9, but Ather will now supply the faster 700W charger with this variant, which alone is well worth the extra money. With its updated pricing, the 450X retains its premium position in the market, and if you’re browsing for a fun scooter, this is still one of the most entertaining ones available.  Also see:  2025 Ather 450X video review",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/best-selling-cars-uk",
    "description": "Ford's compact SUV has topped the UK sales rankings for the second year in a row The Ford Puma has been crowned the UK's best-selling car of 2024, topping the charts for the second consecutive year ahead of other hot-selling rivals.  According to data supplied by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, Ford's compact SUV outsold the Kia Sportage and the Nissan Qashqai, making it the most popular new car on UK roads.  Ford sold 48,340 Pumas, although Kia was close behind, shipping 47,163 Sportages. Nissan finished in third and fourth place with the Juke and Qashqai respectively, while the Tesla Model Y rounded out the top five.  While the Model Y didn't quite reach the top spot, it was the UK's most popular electric car, with the American brand selling 32,862 units - almost double the total of the second-placed Audi Q4 E-tron.  Overall, 2024 was a reasonably positive year for the UK car industry, with new car registrations almost reaching two million units, rising 2.6% year on year.  But which cars join the Puma, Sportage and Qashqai in the UK's best-selling cars top 10?  See the full list below, with data from January to December 2024.  Best-selling cars in the UK in 2024 1. Ford Puma – 48,340 units It's official: the Ford Puma is the UK's best-selling car of 2024. Why is it so popular? The Puma appeals thanks to its engaging driving dynamics and attractive pricing, plus it has the option of a hot Puma ST variant. It may not be the Fiesta we all know and love, but it’s a good, capable alternative nonetheless. It even outsold the Ford Transit and Transit Custom vans, which is no mean feat. There's also the electric Ford Puma Gen-E on the way, which we're equally excited about.  Read our Ford Puma review 2. Kia Sportage – 47,163 units The Kia Sportage had a good year in 2023, finishing fourth in the UK sales charts, and it's having an even stronger showing in 2024, ending the year in second place. Consistency is key for this family SUV, which entered its fifth generation at the tail end of 2022, sporting an eye-catching design, on-trend powertrains and compelling value for money. Read our Kia Sportage review 3. Nissan Qashqai – 42,418 units The Nissan Qashqai was the UK's best-seller in 2022, but it has since been outpaced by rivals, finishing in second in 2023 and third in 2024. That said, it's still extremely popular and continues to appeal to buyers here with its excellent practicality. The British-built family crossover's appeal has also no doubt been bolstered by the addition of electrified powertrains for its third generation.  Read our Nissan Qashqai review 4. Nissan Juke – 34,454 units The Nissan Juke remains a popular car among UK buyers, having finished 2023 in fourth place - a rise of four positions compared with 2023.  The small SUV went on sale with a brand-new design in 2020, and then a facelifted version arrived in the middle of last year, along with hybrid power for the first time. Read our Nissan Juke review 5. Tesla Model Y – 32,862 units The Tesla Model Y has popped in and out of the top 10 throughout the year, but it finished 2024 as the UK's best-selling EV and the only one in the top 10.  A small update in 2024 brought a new battery, which seems to have contributed to the crossover overcoming a sales slump. A bigger update is coming next year, introducing revised styling in line with the Model 3 saloon and an overhauled interior. Read our Tesla Model Y review   6. Volkswagen Golf – 32,370 units The Volkswagen Golf isn’t quite as popular as it once was but it’s still a top pick for drivers on the hunt for a good all-round family hatchback or estate. In fact, it's slowly creeping its way back up the charts, now sitting in fifth place. This could be a hugely important time for the Golf, which has just gone on sale in facelifted 'Mk8.5' form.  The German stalwart has been kept fresh with a wide-reaching technology update, a design revamp, a more powerful GTI and a longer-range plug-in hybrid so it could climb higher still.  Read our Volkswagen Golf review  7. Hyundai Tucson – 32,174 units The Hyundai Tucson is one of the UK’s most popular SUVs, having regularly appeared in the top 10 in 2024. It was renewed in 2021 with a fresh front end that featured a unique, eye-catching lighting arrangement. Its plush interior and range of electrified powertrains are also attractive propositions for many Brits. Read our Hyundai Tucson review 8. MG HS – 30,270 units The MG HS offers class-leading value for money, and it entered a second generation this year, putting it in line for even more mainstream success in 2025 and beyond. Available with a petrol engine or a more frugal plug-in hybrid, the family crossover also comes with good levels of equipment as standard, including a 10.1in touchscreen, a 360deg parking camera and smartphone mirroring.  Read our MG HS review 9. Volvo XC40 – 30,202 Volvo's compact SUV offers a premium feel for a reasonable price point, and it has steered clear of offering the same interior as the new EX30 and the EX90.  It still looks great to our eyes, and there are few models out there that can match it for dynamics, comfort and functionality.  It's wonderfully polished on the road and seriously easy to live with, so it's no surprise to see the model's continuing popularity.  Read our Volvo XC40 review 10. Volkswagen Polo – 27,674 Despite its price (and size) increasing over the years, the Volkswagen Polo is still a brilliant small car. It's comfortable, refined, well-built and spacious, while also offering some of the best economy rates in the class. The latest version is the best to drive yet and is packed with technology. But how long will it stick around for? That we're not sure of, so make the most of it before it goes the way of the Ford Fiesta.  Read our Volkswagen Polo review",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/genesis-gv60-gets-new-look-and-refreshed-interior",
    "description": "New lights use micro-lens array construction Premium sibling to Kia EV6 and Hyundai Ioniq 5 is expected to follow suit and gain a bigger battery The Genesis GV60 has been updated with a sportier look and reworked interior technology. The most prominent changes come on the exterior of the electric SUV. Up front, the vents around the lower grille area have been made more prominent, and the headlights use a new micro-lens array construction. The wheel arches and skirting are now finished in the car’s body colour, rather than the grey that is used on the outgoing model. Inside, the new GV60 gets a revised display screen, doing away with the prominent bezel that previously divided its infotainment and instrument sections. The screen is also thinner than before, bringing a sleeker look. The changes are rounded off with a new three-spoke steering wheel, replacing the current two-spoke unit.  Genesis has yet to announce any changes under the skin, but updates recently made to the closely related Kia EV6 and Hyundai Ioniq 5 hint at what can be expected. Those cars received new batteries, upsized from 77kWh to 84kWh. For the EV6, this brought an increase in range from 328 miles to 361 miles. For reference, the GV60 currently offers up to 321 miles of range in its entry-level Premium trim. This dips to 292 miles in four-wheel-drive Sport form and 289 miles in the range-topping Sport Plus car. It’s likely these will be boosted to above 300 miles with a new battery pack. The new GV60 is expected to arrive in UK showrooms this summer, with prices likely to represent a slight increase over the current entry point of £58,565. The electric crossover is an important model for Genesis in the UK: Autocar understands it accounts for around a third of the brand’s total sales here, beaten only by the larger GV70, which has the advantage of being offered with petrol and diesel drivetrains as well as electric power.",

Exclusively manufactured and sold locally, the cheap and cheerful single sold in droves in its heyday, mostly to commuters and delivery riders. It’s no longer in production—but it’s found new life in the custom scene. We’ve seen slick custom SR150s from workshops like Hide Work Custom, TwentyTwo Custom, and Twist.Co. But this plucky Yamaha SR150 bobber comes from an outfit that’s new to these pages; Balls Custom. Based in New Taipei City, the cheekily-named Balls Custom shop is part workshop, part café. They were tasked with customizing the Yamaha SR150 by a female rider who wanted something small and manageable to scoot around on.

    "link": "https://www.bikeexif.com/triumph-scrambler-900-heiwa",
    "description": "Many custom bike builders develop a signature style over time—but that style is often attached to one particular make, model, or era of motorcycling. Then there are craftsmen who can apply their distinct art to any canvas, without compromise. Kengo Kimura of Heiwa MC is one such artisan. Based in Hiroshima, Kimura-san is one of the leading lights in the Japanese custom scene. His custom bikes are recognizable for their elegant tapered silhouettes, and the way each part harmonizes with the next. Most of his projects use older models as donors, but he’s just as adept at modifying new bikes—as evidenced by this handsome 2024-model custom Triumph Scrambler 900. What’s remarkable is how much Kengo’s been able to manipulate the modern Triumph to suit his vision.…",

    "description": "Only here for three quick months that flew by in a flash, the Punch EV didn’t feel like a ‘long’ termer in the same way most of our others do. That is partly due to the fact that it frequently changed hands within the team since everyone wanted to have some time with it, and thus, no one ever used it for a long enough spell. On a less favourable note, it’s also because we’ve actually had two Punch EVs in the fleet, as Tata gave us a temporary replacement car when it took this one in for inspection after it threw up a critical alert in its first week with us, and would not start. Once it was back, the error never showed again, though it was not without other electronic gaffes, such as the camera feeds sometimes going blank, the infotainment system freezing, wireless charging stopping frequently, and my phone being regularly booted out of Android Auto. They really need to address these software gremlins soon. I’m also not a fan of how it has an auditory alert for… everything! Changing drive modes, engaging the parking brake, and even leaving the rear seatbelts unfastened (even without passengers) fires off some form of annoying alert. Show, don’t tell, Tata Motors. No rear load sensors means seat belt warning beeps unless buckled at all times. More time behind the wheel has allowed me to dig into the nuances of the powertrain a bit more. Mixing it up with other EVs, I’ve found Tata’s Acti.ev architecture could do with a bit more refinement. No, I don’t mean the NVH levels (those are excellent), but rather the control weights, brake blending and power delivery. It can feel abrupt and erratic as you move from accelerating to coasting to braking, and with the rapid rate at which EVs are evolving, there are others that now do it more seamlessly.  It’s not, however, enough to take away from the fact this is a great all-round package – and that’s before you even consider its price or its compact and convenient size. I’ve loved my commutes to work in it and the ability to park in the tiniest of spots – an essential trait for a car in Mumbai. Plus, it goes like hell if you want it to and has an almost uncanny ability to absorb even the harshest of bumps at any speed. While I’m far from the most efficient driver, even I managed a superb 6.9km/kWh in the Punch EV. But my colleague Lokesh from our Hindi channel WhatCar? India managed 8.5! The battery may not be huge, but you can really rinse out every cell in this car. Good design, light colours give it a premium feel inside. Perhaps the brevity of its tenure has also afforded me a greater appreciation of its light-coloured interior since I’m not the one who’s going to have to get it detailed every second month. When it’s clean, though, the effect it has is tremendous – as if it’s trickled down directly from Tata-owned Range Rover. Even the steering wheel is dual-tone leatherette-wrapped, grey and cream, which is a bold choice in an entry-level EV, and then there’s the liberal use of gloss black plastic that looks great, though it is prone to smudges, scratches and reflections. Helpful battery, charging data on screens (when they work). There is a sense with this car, and a lot of Tata models if I’m honest, that design comes first and foremost, whether inside or out, and I like that. The brand’s family aesthetic runs through the Punch EV, and it extends not just to the bodywork and upholstery but also to the screen graphics. Yes, those screens may glitch, and the text is too small in places, but boy, do they look good! They’re colourful, clean, and actually pack in a good amount of data and features. Tata’s EV reign may have plateaued – the MG Windsor even took the top spot on the sales charts – but that appears more a function of market trends. The brand does need to sort out its electric and electronic gremlins immediately, which is something that’s plaguing the ICE models, too. Because once they do, the model range on offer is nothing short of impressive, and it’s only growing. As I’ve said before, there are bigger, better Tata EVs, but the Punch EV is a concentrated distillation of everything the brand has done so far. Will we have another electric Tata in our fleet soon? I hope so. Also see: Tata Punch EV long term review, 7,000km report Tata Punch EV review: Feels like a mini-Nexon EV",

I’ve enjoyed the NC500 in Scotland, crossed the Lake District, and plowed through Snowdonia, but Southern Ireland, with its wild coastline and craggy rocks, has always been on the list and finally, I had the good fortune to tick it off. And I didn’t just ‘tick it off’ - I did it in style, with luxury, culinary treats, and a few rather decent Italian cars.

Such is the story of Axel Budde from Kaffeemaschine Motorcycles. “I started motorcycling on a BMW when I was 18 in 1994. I actually fancied old English motorcycles, but couldn´t afford them,” Axel said. “When I was 20 I was looking for a bigger classic motorcycle, but nothing was really satisfying. The BMW engine just didn´t speak to me, the English bikes were a bit too small, and 4 cylinders did not appeal to me aesthetically.” That’s when a finely aged Italian came into his life, bringing with it the sense of fulfillment he'd been longing for all those years.

    "description": "BYD India will launch the Sealion 7 by March this year. Ahead of its price announcement, the coupe-SUV will make its India debut at the Auto Expo 2025, which starts on January 17. Along with the Sealion 7, BYD India will also have its existing electric vehicles, including the Seal sedan, Atto 3 SUV and the BYD eMax 7 MPV on display. BYD Sealion 7 India launch this year It comes with two Blade battery options It shares a lot of design cues with the Seal sedan BYD Sealion 7 will be positioned above the Seal sedan  Unveiled last year, the BYD Sealion 7 is already on sale in China and some European markets. Touted as an affordable option to the Tesla Model Y overseas, BYD’s stylish coupe-SUV shares a lot of design cues with the Seal sedan that’s on sale in India. It has similar headlamps and connected tail-lamp setups with a more aggressive front and rear bumper design. On the inside, a lot is pretty similar to the Seal sedan, with the highlight being a large rotating screen that has been a signature feature in most BYD models. The Sealion 7 measures around 4.8 metres in length and gets FWD and RWD overseas.    The Sealion 7 coupe-SUV sits on BYD’s e-Platform 3.0 Evo-born electric architecture and comes with the brand’s innovative Blade battery setup. The SUV is sold with two battery options – 82.5kWh and 91.3kWh – with a maximum range of up to 502km. As far as pricing goes, the Sealion 7 will be placed above the Seal sedan (Rs 41 lakh ex-showroom) in the Indian market. While there may not be a direct rival to the Sealion 7 in India, it will indirectly compete with the likes of the Kia EV6 and the Hyundai Ioniq 5 in our market. Expect more details on the India-bound BYD Sealion 7 SUV’s specification and equipment at its India debut later this month. BYD India has also announced that the number of cities in its India showroom network, which stands at 27 currently, will go up to 40 this year.  Also read BYD Seal review, test drive",
