    "description": "This 1936 Bentley 4¼ Litre began its life with Gurney Nutting coupe coachwork and was purchased in 1993 by designer and Art Center College of Design graduate Gary D. Moore, who set forth transforming it with custom roadster coachwork of his own design. Inspired by the streamlined styling of Georges Paulin’s “Emiricos” Bentley coupe of 1938, chassis B25GP’s aluminum bodywork was hand-fabricated by Bill Gathings over a wood body buck constructed by Doug Chalmers, who also contributed the build’s ash framework. After its completion in 2014, the car garnered several awards including Best of Show at the 2014 Palos Verdes Concours d’Elegance, Best Classic Design at the 2014 Art Center College of Design Car Show, and the People’s Choice Award at the 2015 La Jolla Concours d’Elegance as well as class and special awards at RROC meets in Pennsylvania and California. The car remained with its designer until 2016 when it was purchased by its current owner. Finished in metallic gray, it is powered by a 4,257cc inline-six that features twin SU carburetors and is mated to a four-speed manual transmission. Additional features include servo-assisted mechanical drum brakes, hydraulic shock absorbers that are adjustable from the steering wheel, a Bijur central lubrication system, 18” wire wheels with body-color disc covers, a central fog light, tan ostrich hide over seating for two, and dual-grain wood interior accents. This custom-bodied 4¼ Litre is now offered on dealer consignment in California with spare trim pieces, a tool kit and owner’s manuals in ostrich-hide pouches, a portfolio with photos from the build, a black soft top with matching side curtains, and a clean Wyoming title.",

    "description": "Few products have had as tumultuous a journey from concept to reality as the Simple One. Shown first in 2021 with a promise to go on sale in 2022, it eventually went on sale in mid-2023. Fast forward to 2025, and after 1,817 units sold (as per VAHAN data), Simple Energy has updated the One. Simple One updates for 2025 The main update is that it now has a claimed 248km IDC range, up from the original 212km. It has the same 5kWh battery capacity as before, and the company says this increase has been achieved via some electronic trickery and a more efficient drivetrain.  There was no way to test those numbers in our limited time with it, but what I can tell you is that in 45km of mixed riding in all four modes (Eco, Ride, Dash and Sonic), the battery dropped from full to 76 percent SOC. Simple One design, performance This was my first time seeing a Simple One in the flesh, and I thought it was a smashing-looking thing, even if its sharp and angular design is somewhat similar to the Ather 450’s. Quality, too, is at a pleasantly high level, and there are no flimsy plastics or uneven panel gaps. At 30 litres, the One doesn’t have the biggest boot in the segment, but its shape allows you to fit an ECE-certified full-face helmet inside comfortably.   And once you swing your leg over it, you’ll discover the One has the go to match the show. With 8.5kW and 72Nm of torque on tap, acceleration in any mode is peppy, and even in the lowest mode, it can climb flyovers without slowing down. Achieving and maintaining the claimed 105kph top speed is effortless in Dash and Sonic. However, acceleration from a standstill doesn’t feel as spirited as in the Warp mode on an Ather 450. Simple One areas of improvement The problem is that in both of the top two modes, the scooter surges forward for a second or two even once the accelerator is closed, which can put you in trouble, considering the strong performance. We reported this issue when we first rode the prototype in 2022, and it’s disappointing that it hasn’t been resolved. Simple says it is aware of it and is working on a solution, but I think this should have been ironed out before customer deliveries began.   While the scooter’s sporty design language may lead you to believe that it will be stiffly sprung, the suspension setup is rather plush, and the One is one of the more comfortable electric scooters I’ve experienced. However, at 136kg, its weight isn’t something that you can shake off, and what only compounds matters further is the tall (for a scooter) 796mm seat height.  Simple One price, verdict Currently, Simple Energy has only 10 showrooms operational. The company says it plans to scale up to 150 showrooms by March 2026 and bring in a generation two product (the one we rode was termed ‘version 1.5’) to bolster its portfolio. Ultimately, all of that is in the future, and Simple still has much to prove. Until Simple Energy scales up its dealer network and builds a good after-sales reputation, the Rs 1.66 lakh One and its more affordable sibling, the Rs 1.45 lakh Dot One, will remain niche offerings.    All prices ex-showroom, Bengaluru Also See: Simple Energy One prototype review: A simple answer?",

    "description": "Engage “Rock” mode, shift to neutral, engage low range, shift to drive, hit the G-Turn button, select the direction of rotation using the paddles, ensure the steering is dead straight, flex your right foot and be prepared to get ‘shocked’ as the almost 3.1-tonneSUV spins around like a ballet dancer. In fact, that’s also how the electric G-Class was introduced to the world. Dubbed as the EQG in concept guise, the Mercedes-Benz G 580 with EQ Technology –yes, that’s its full name – is the G-Class for the silent, and hopefully pollution-free future. With an aim to retain all of its iconic elements while packing in the latest EV tech under the skin, the green plate G-Class has the glitz and glamour you expect of a Gelandewagen. But what about its character that is rooted in guns and glory? Can it withstand an apocalypse? Mercedes G Class Electric off-road ability To find out if it is all show and no go, taking it off-road is the best litmus test. Learn Off-road near Mumbai is the ideal venue not only because of its controlled environment, but it also has obstacles that will truly challenge the might of the G. I started by checking the lean angle on the side slope. As the car leaned over, I could see the world from an acute angle, with the only reassurance being the claimed ability to take on inclined angles as steep as 35 degrees, equivalent to a 70 percent gradient. With my eyes locked in on the spotter, I, thankfully, made it out without tipping over. Next up was a test of the dramatic wheel articulation. Like the ICE version, the G 580 also features independent front suspension and a rigid axle at the rear. However, there are no diff locks.In its place are what Mercedes calls “Virtual Diffs”, which are motors that can operate individually for each wheel. Also, with the motors spinning at high speeds, the low-range gear in each of them multiplies the torque in low-speed applications to avoid overheating.         View this post on Instagram                       A post shared by Autocar India (@autocar_india) As the front right wheel enters a gorge, the rear left wheel crunches to offer all the support. Slowly inching ahead, the weight transfer rocks you and makes you nervous about the battery pack stowed beneath the car. The battery is split into two – with a cooling layer sandwiched in between – andhas been integrated into the modified ladder frame. This ensures a low centre of gravity and also helps make it rigid. For protection, however, there is a thick 57kg carbon composite case, which is about 150kg lighter than an equivalent steel plate of the same thickness. Mercedes engineers have done vigorous tests to ensure there is no room for punctures and leaks, and that the plate can withstand six times the weight of the car. That’s saying something. It is also torsion-resistant, so any form of flex won’t be an issue.The whole casing is also waterproof, allowing for up to 850mm water wading – 150mm more than the ICE version. Plenty of relevant off-road telemetry to geek out on. But the highlights were the off-road features exclusive to the electric G that you don’t get on the ICE version. First was the intelligent off-road crawl, which is essentially cruise control for steep climbs and drops with the electronics managing that four-figure torque and ensuring there is no wheel slip. The crawl is activated as soon as you engage low range,and with three levels of set speed, you need not modulate throttle and brake continuously. Of course, you can override the system by simply tapping on the brake or accelerator. What also helps climb slopes is the transparent bonnet that gives you a view of what’s under the car. This allows you to focus on your line and is one less thing to worry about when you can barely see out the windshield. The electric G also has better approach and departure angles compared to the G 63 due to the reprofiled bumpers and high ground clearance, but the battery pack positioned under the car means the breakover angle is not as good as the AMG. Then there is the G-Steering, which reduces the turning circle and makes tight turns a breeze. Engage rock mode and select G-steering and the car will lock the inside rear wheel to pivot around itself, thereby shortening the turning radius. It remains engaged for speeds upto 25kph, and you need to apply full-lock to the steering to stall that inner rear wheel. Transparent bonnet helps when the spotter doesn’t. However, the most talked about feature by far is the G-Turn,with its 8-step engaging procedure I explained in the beginning. Sure, it may seem like a gimmick and is huge fun, but it is useful if you are stuck in muck and need to clear out some area around you. Also, while the system spins the car around twice, you can stop it at whichever position you want by just letting go of the paddleshifter. After spending half a day bashing the G over multiple obstacles, it was clear that if you want the more capable G, the 580 EQ is the top choice. Mercedes G Class Electric performance Now, it’s clearly better off-road, but does that also hold true on tarmac? To begin with, there is a faint electric buzz around it – Mercedes calls it the ‘Aura’ of the G 580 – presumably to warn pedestrians that a 3.1-tonne monster is creeping up behind. There is also the G-Roar, which mimics – or at least tries to –the V8’s notes. The effort is commendable and definitely better than some sci-fi spaceship sound, but it needs to be more pronounced and not sound like the V8 is growling with a tape over its mouth. Performance though, is brisk. With 587hp and 1,164Nm, this G is fast enough to wear an AMG badge. For its 3,085kg kerb weight, you expect it to have the athleticism of a hippopotamus, but the motors, powered by a 116kWh battery, put out 587hp and a colossal 1,164Nm of torque that ensure rapid responses. Off the line, the G 580 squats and shoots off to 100kph in just 5.05 seconds. Kickdown times for 20-80kph and 40-100kph are also impressive. Then there are drive modes that alter its character; Comfort offering slightly more laidback reactions in comparison to the immediacy of Sport mode. Still, there is enough poke for it to even wear an AMG badge, and wear it with pride. Individual mode allows you to customise the performance of the steering, motor and even the adaptive dampers in the suspension. Mercedes G Class Electric ride and handling Not the comfiest highway cruiser, but it oozes charm and street cred. With huge 20-inch wheels, and a lot of the weightlower down, a firm ride is inevitable. However, the adaptive dampers do a very good job of muting the harsh thuds, and while you do rock about a fair bit, there is an inherent toughness and the ability to carry more speed over a rough section. On the highway, while the insulation is good, there is a fair bit of road noise from the big tyres. You would also have to be delusional to expect delicate handlingaround corners. You have to chuck the big boy into a corner and hold on as all the principles of mechanics try to wash it into understeer. Grip levels are good, and with moderate pace the steering is light, too, but a fun handler it’s not. Mercedes G Class Electric range, battery and charging Clever packaging of battery between the ladder frame chassis. This wasn’t a full-blown Autocar range test given the focus on off-roading, but we started the drive from our office in Mumbai with 100 percent charge and 416-443km indicated range. After a whole day out and driving 245km,the battery SOC stated that there was 27 percent charge left and a range of 110-122km. That gives an efficiency of 2.89km/kWh and a range of 336km. Sure, you won’t be off-roading and doing multiple G-turns every day so expect that number to be around the 350-375km mark. The 400V architecture allows for upto 200kW DC charging that takes just 32 minutes to go from 10-80 percent, while the 11kW AC charger will top it up from 0-100 percent in 12.5 hours. But range is not the highest priority for a G-Class customer. It’s all the fun mentioned before this section. Mercedes G Class Electric G 580 charging times10-80% (200kW DC)32 mins10-80% (50kW DC) 1 hr 43 min0-100% (11kW AC)12 hr 30 min Mercedes G Class Electric interior and features Diff lock switches replaced by G-Steering and G-Turn On the inside, the G 580’s dashboard and switchgear design are similar to the ICE version, but there are subtle modifications compared to the ICE’s cabin that are tastefully done. The dual 12.3-inch screens now get MBUX functionality, which means, like the G 63, the G 580 also gets a slick and responsive touchscreen. Packed with tech information, the UI is very easy to use and works efficiently. The other great bit are physical switches for the HVAC and media controls and the new off-road buttons in place of the iconic diff-lock switches. Plenty of space for three adults; flat floor a bonus. The seats are well-sized but the cushioning is a bit firm. However, it still packs in luxuries like the massage and ventilation options. There is a standard-sized sunroof too. However, since this is the Edition One, there is subtle use of blue all around. The stitching in the seats, the weave between the carbon-fibre panels on the centre console and even on the steering wheel. 620-litre boot is massive by EV standards. No frunk though. In the back, the high ground clearance means you need to jump inside, which is going to be tricky without any grab rail. But once you’re in, space is not going to be a complaint. The seats though aren’t the best for the money, and while a flat floor, rear vents and three-zone climate control make it comfy for three adults, the seat to be in is behind the steering wheel. There is no frunk under the bonnet and you instead get a sizeable 620-litre boot, which is 20 litres less than the G 63, but it’s hardly noticeable. A slightly raised boot floor is where it lost those extra few litres. Still, hugely impressive by electric standards. Mercedes G Class Electric exterior Now, although the G 580 does away with an engine and exhaust, it still carries the same iconic design that makes everyone take notice. Especially in this exclusive shade of blue, dubbed MANUFAKTUR South Sea Blue Magno. 20-inch wheels are huge but a bit too subtle. If you see it whiz past your window, you won’t be able to tell if it is the electric version –the changes are far too subtle. Get a micrometre and a magnifying glass and you'll notice a swelled-up bonnet, a new A-pillar design, bumpers with different air intakes, air curtains in the rear wheel-arch flare, and, of course, a green number plate. Everything else is classic G. The round headlamps, chunky indicators and upright windshield retain the OG look. But you do miss out on the more closed-off grille with DRL surrounds like the international version. Over to the side, the only missing bit are the exhausts poking out, like you have on the AMG. The length and wheelbase are the same and the ground clearance, at 250mm, is more than the G 63. The blacked-out 20-inch wheels are big but look unassuming, and a close look reveals the brake calipers sport the same blue shade as the exterior. Getting inside almost equivalent to practicing for 100m hurdles. Some expected the rear to look different, courtesy of the boxy charging case seen on the global version. But for India, the G 580 will not get that option and a very handy spare wheel will reign supreme. Mercedes G Class Electric price and verdict At Rs 3 crore (ex-showroom, India), the G 580 is almost Rs 65 lakh cheaper than the G 63, and it does everything that the AMG does and then some. It looks the part, gets you all the cred and is unbelievably capable. Yes, you do feel the absence of the brutish V8 and its hysteria, but that is a small price to pay. In a future that did not look kind to icons like the G-Class, the G 580 is over three tonnes of proof that as long as the three-pointed star lives on, the G will live on.

    "description": "Left-field supercar gets more power, more focused suspension and lots of aero for this big money special edition The race championship that has inspired this Maserati MC20 GT2 Stradale supercar is called the GT2 European Series, which sounds very, very fast – but that’s somewhat misleading.The cars in this mostly amateur endeavour sit somewhere between GT3 and GT4 machinery in terms of their performance, suiting mildly uprated road cars. Those homologated include the Porsche 911, KTM X-Bow and Mercedes-AMG GT.The Maserati MC20 was made racy in 2023 and has since won quite a few times.Now Maserati has created a limited-edition roadgoing variant to mark the brand’s return to the race track. And while the European GT2 series isn’t super professional international GT racing, there is at least an identifiable link between the race and road cars.The new MC20 GT2 Stradale, limited to 914 units and coming in £46,000 more expensive than standard, at £273,510, gets the kind of changes that make it a more capable but also more dependable track car.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-peugeot-boss-open-208-gti-revival",
    "description": "Hot hatch would likely be a performance-tuned variant of the e-208, suggests Alain Favey Peugeot is considering reviving the Peugeot 208 GTi as a hot EV, new boss Alain Favey has said. Favey said bringing the GTi moniker back was “a question I’ve been asking myself very much” since taking over the role of Peugeot CEO from Linda Jackson as part of a wide-reaching Stellantis management shake-up just 10 days ago,  The GTi badge has not appeared on a 208 since the second-generation car arrived in 2019 and it has not adorned a Peugeot car since the 308 GTi went off sale in 2021. The Peugeot Sport Engineered (PSE) sub-brand was originally expected to fill the GTi gap in Peugeot’s line-up, but it was only ever attached to a variant of the 508 and was effectively killed off in the UK in December following the culling of that model. But when asked during the brand’s E-Lion Day if there were any plans for an e-208 GTi, Favey said: “I am very eager to connect the Peugeot brand with what it stands for to its past, to its heritage in every sense.  “So we will look back at what the heritage of the brand is and we will see to what extent this can be adapted to the modern world – and there is nothing excluded in our review of this and certainly not the GTi badge, for sure.” It would make sense for any hot models to use the same set up as Lancia Ypsilon HF hatch and Abarth’s 600e crossover, with which the e-208 shares its e-CMP platform. Both send 237bhp through their front wheels and use a Torsen limited-slip differential.  The Abarth 600e is also offered with a 278bhp motor, but this is unlikely to be offered on the smaller e-208, given its positioning. Giving the green light to an e-208 GTi would also be likely to result in a hot version of the Vauxhall Corsa Electric, given the two models are twinned.  It remains to be seen whether Peugeot or Vauxhall deems an electric hot hatch to be commercially viable, especially as the Corsa and 208 are expected to be replaced next year by new-generation models based on Stellantis’s new STLA Small platform.  But given the Abarth 600e proves that the e-CMP platform can comfortably accommodate a more potent front motor and a performance-targeted chassis makeover, hot versions of the 208 and Corsa could be launched as performance swangsongs for the outgoing generation.",

    "description": "Whether they’re designing luggage or planning picturesque rallies through the European Alps, motorcycles are core to everything that Malle London does. But so is style. So it stands to reason that the vehicles Malle picks for their endeavors are as tasteful as the gear they create. These two Royal Enfield Continental GT 650s were built as the official support vehicles for the fourth running of the Great Malle Mountain Rally. Ridden by the rally’s support engineers—Malle co-founder Robert Nightingale and deBolex Engineering’s Calum Pryce-Tidd—the bikes were designed to be the last out and last in on the six-day regulation rally. Starting in Austria and finishing in Monaco, the Great Malle Mountain Rally crosses six countries over 2,000 km [1,243 miles], rising thousands of meters above sea level with more turns and switchbacks than you can count.…",

    "description": "You can often tell when a custom motorcycle has been built merely to gawk at, and when it’s been built to be ridden. This rowdy Harley Sportster flat tracker leaves little room for doubt. Inspired by the iconic Harley XR750, it hits all the right aesthetic notes, with a build spec tailored to daily abuse. It belongs to Romain Leclerc—a filmmaker based near Toulon on the French Riviera. As a teen, Romain rode BMX with a group of friends who called themselves ‘Les Pirates.’ Years later, the guys graduated from bicycles to motorcycles, riding and customizing them with the same irreverent energy that marked their BMX days. This Sportster is Romain’s second custom build, not counting the bikes that he uses for racing and track days.…",

    "description": "﻿ The Datsun 240Z was never the problem. It was the solution. The answer to a world where European sports cars carried steep price tags and Japanese cars were still thought of as nothing more than basic transportation. For years, Japanese cars in America were what students drove to class, what families bought when they were new, when money was tight, or what commuters relied on when fuel prices spiked. They were appliances, used for economy, and durability. It’s easy to look back on them now as more than products of their time. But they weren’t. They filled parking lots at office buildings and grocery stores, racked up hundreds of thousands of miles on city roads, and lived out their lives as forgettable hand-me-downs, passed from one generation to the next until they rusted into the ground. They were not the cars enthusiasts dreamed about, not the machines people pinned on their walls or took out on Sunday after church for a little exercise. Today we love the quirky, endearing nature of the classic Japanese econobox, but back then? It was a tool.  The Z was one of the cars that changed everything. It was Japan’s bold declaration, a machine shaped by the same relentless craftsmanship and discipline that defined the country’s post-war industrial rise. It embodied the Japanese philosophy of kaizen, continuous improvement.  The Z was beautiful, with the long nose of a Ferrari, and an inline-six that, despite its modest origins (and with some SU carburetors installed), could sing when you need it to. In 1970, it was fast enough, with a chassis that felt nimble, eager, and alive in a way most Americans had never experienced in something that did not wear a European badge. It was still affordable, but it was no longer just transportation. It was undeniably a sports car. But time does not stand still. Roads get wider. And for better or worse, cars get faster, stop better, turn sharper, and expectations shift. The Z’s magic is still there, but modern traffic, modern brakes, and modern speed put it in a different context. It still thrives on momentum and chassis respect. But, time marches on. The engineers at Nissan did not create the perfect Z, they created the best one they could for the money, theirs, and yours. So, as is often the case as we make engine noises in our garage over winter, pontificating on what we can modify, and how things could be better. The question is not whether the Z is still great as it was, it is how much better could it be? For Rahail Tariq, the Z had been lurking in his subconscious, a shape that had stuck with him from flipping through magazine pages. When he finally got his first 240Z, his first classic car, it was white, with black sills and a set of 260Z wheels that he did not even know were incorrect at the time. He bought it online in 2005, not as an expert but as someone drawn to its presence, and it’s silhouette. That car, with all its patina and imperfections, was the seed that eventually grew into MZR Roadsports.   Rahail’s connection to cars ran deeper than just his own discoveries. His father, a technician in the 1970s, was always bringing home interesting machinery, M5s, Mini Coopers, Daimlers, even an E-Type Jaguar. Growing up around those cars, seeing the way his father worked on them, improved them, and understood them, gave him an appreciation for cars as something alive, something that could always be made better. The Z was just the first car where Rahail realized that he was the one who would have to push it forward. In the UK, where classic Japanese sports cars did not have the same deep-rooted restoration culture as Porsches or E-Types, Rahail found himself frustrated. Nobody was building the Z the way he envisioned it. No one was taking it to its logical next step, not just restoring but refining, improving. That search led him to Martin Ryland, a Datsun expert who eventually became his collaborator and helped shape the vision of MZR. Restomods are sometimes frowned upon, seen as tampering with an icon, but consider this. Given the opportunity, is it possible Nissan would have never left the Z as it was? If the company had continued refining it with an unlimited budget, what would it have looked like? A lighter chassis, a more rigid structure, and an engine with sharper response and a little more urgency. That is exactly what MZR is doing, finishing what the original engineers, given enough time, could have done, maybe even would have done, but did not. Their Evolution models, built with bespoke carbon-fiber bodywork, are not just about chasing numbers. Yes, the RB 3.4L DOHC straight-six delivers over 300 horsepower, and yes, the six-speed manual brings precision to every shift, but the real magic is in how it all comes together. It is a 240Z honed and distilled, shaped by the same kaizen philosophy that defined its creation, an ongoing pursuit of refinement, balance, and purpose. The 240Z never needed saving, it was never the problem after all. But it deserved to be honored, not just looked at through the lens of nostalgia. It was built to be driven, and MZR has made sure that it still begs to be. Continue...",

    "description": "It’s akin to landing a dream job you lied through your teeth to get. You walk in on day one, staring down a pile of responsibilities you aren’t remotely qualified for. The job? Managing a car with a 1.5-liter turbo engine running around 2 bar of boost mounted where the groceries used to go. No airbag, no abs, no training wheels. Just figure it out before you get fired or, in this case, sent backward through a guardrail. Your new boss, (who ignores OSHA and HR) the Renault R5 Maxi Turbo, expects results.  Juan Carlos Fernandez knows what it’s like to start from nothing. In 1963, his family fled Cuba with an infant Juan in tow, leaving behind their home, their belongings, everything they had ever known. They landed in Puerto Rico with no roadmap, just the need to survive. His parents worked tirelessly to rebuild, instilling in him the kind of work ethic that doesn’t ask for shortcuts. By the time he was a teenager, cars had his full attention. His cousins were in the auto business, and he scraped together whatever he could to buy his first car, a $200 project. One car turned into two. Two turned into three. The hustle never stopped. If he needed more money, he worked harder. Decades later, that drive turned into Ferco Motors, the dealership he owns today.  A friend once told him the R5 was “so ugly it’s beautiful,” but to Juan, it was just beautiful. It had character, presence, and the kind of raw, unfiltered driving experience that modern cars have lost. It wasn’t built for straight-line speed or effortless performance, it was built to be driven hard, to demand something from the driver. And that’s exactly what drew him to it. The R5 is a product of Renault’s obsession with Group B, the golden era of rally racing where manufacturers built the most extreme machines they could get away with. The FIA required manufacturers to build a limited number of road-going versions to compete, and Renault’s answer was to take their humble economy hatch and reimagine it into something wild. At risk of boiling things down, and for the sake of brevity we’ll just say the engine was moved to the back, the body was widened, and the power was turned up The result was the R5 Turbo. That car made its competition debut in 1980 at the Tour de Corse, a rally known for its tight, twisting tarmac stages. French driver Jean Ragnotti piloted the car and, despite being up against much more developed machines, showed its potential. The real breakthrough came the following year when Ragnotti drove the R5 Turbo to an outright victory at the 1981 Monte Carlo Rally. It was undoubtedly good, but... was more possible?       Enter the R5 Maxi Turbo, the ultimate version, the final boss. It was built to compete with the Audi Quattro and the Peugeot 205 T16. Definitely a tough crowd. Renault brought in Bozian Racing, a French motorsport engineering firm known for squeezing every last drop of performance out of small-displacement engines. In this case they pulled 350 horsepower out of Renaults 1.5L engine. They made the car stiffer, and increased the work aerodynamics were doing.  It had some success in competition, and proved its mettle on tarmac, but as all-wheel-drive rivals took over, its time on the dirt and in the spotlight, faded.  Juan’s R5 wasn’t perfect when he bought it. It had been sitting, neglected, and the first drive was a disappointment. No boost, a failing clutch, just a reminder that even the greats need work, and time spares no one, and no thing. But with the right expertise, the right people, and a lot of effort, it came back to life, a worthy tribute to the Group B legend.  Juan Carlos Fernandez didn’t get here by taking the easy way. He came from nothing, worked for everything, and never asked for a shortcut. The R5 doesn’t give one either. It just wants you to show up for work. Continue...",
