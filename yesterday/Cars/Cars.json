    "description": "This 1987 Lamborghini Countach is one of approximately 610 of the 5000 Quattrovalvole variant produced between 1985 and 1988. The car wears a European-specification front bumper and taillights along with later \"1988.5\" side skirts and is finished in white over Bianco leather upholstery. It rides on white 15″ Ruote OZ wheels and is powered by a fuel-injected 5.2L quad-cam V12 linked with a gated five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. Work in 2023 and 2024 totaling over $114k involved performing paint correction, updating the air conditioning system, overhauling the four-wheel disc brakes, rebuilding the rear suspension, and replacing the flywheel and clutch assembly as well as adding an aftermarket exhaust system and test pipes. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2025, this Countach 5000 QV is now offered in Illinois with recent service records and a clean Utah title.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/uk-government-poised-relax-ev-targets-response-us-tariffs",
    "description": "Changes to ZEV mandate set to be made next week to help car makers mitigate impact of 25% import duty The UK government is poised to relax its mandated electric car sales targets next week, in a bid to help manufacturers contend with the impact of the US's newly imposed car import tariffs. According to The Telegraph, prime minister Keir Starmer will accelerate the changes that are being made to the framework of the UK's zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, following a consultation process with the industry in reaction to slower-than-expected uptake of EVs. It's reported that the rules of the ZEV mandate will be changed next week to give manufacturers extra flexibilities, but the headline targets are expected to be unchanged. So manufacturers will still have to achieve a 28% EV sales mix in 2025, but other mechanisms for achieving compliance are likely to be integrated.  Figures released today (4 April) show that EVs accounted for just over 19% of car sales last month, more than eight percentage points behind the target for the year, and SMMT boss Mike Hawes said \"the current regulatory regime is undeliverable\" without proper support from the government.  The newly announced US tariffs have heightened the need for support, as all new cars exported from the UK to the US now attract a 25% import duty - a cost that the SMMT says \"cannot be absorbed by manufacturers\". Last year, 27% of the cars exported from UK factories went to the US.  Starmer is attempting to strike a new trade deal with US president Donald Trump in a bid to neutralise the impact of the tariff, but ministers are drawing up a list of retaliatory measures the UK could put in place in the coming weeks if he is unsuccessful.  Transport secretary Heidi Alexander launched the consultation on the UK's transition to EVs late last year, in a bid to \"restore clarity for vehicle manufacturers and the charging industry so that they have the confidence to invest in the UK in the long-term and drive growth in the UK automotive industry\". It came after business secretary Jonathan Reynolds acknowledged that the level of organic demand for EVs was falling short of the targets imposed by the previous Conservative government's ZEV mandate and pledged to work with the industry to find \"options for a better way forward\". The consultation, which closed last month, sought feedback from the industry on how to update the framework of the ZEV mandate, which states that car makers must achieve an EV sales mix of 28% in 2025 – rising incrementally each year to 80% by 2030 – or face heavy fines for every non-electric car sold over the threshold. The government said previously there were already \"a range of flexibilities\" built into the ZEV mandate, referring to the ability for manufacturers to trade EV sales 'credits', and the Vehicle Emissions Trading (VETS) scheme, which essentially imposes less stringent EV sales targets on car makers with lower overall fleet emissions. The consultation, though, was said to \"explore the design of the flexibilities to ensure they continue to support manufacturers\". It isn't clear what modifications to this scheme could look like, but possibilities include allowing hybrid vehicles to partly count towards EV sales targets, factoring in light commercial vehicle sales as well as cars, and counting UK-built electric vehicles towards their respective manufacturer's goal. Importantly, the consultation was also designed to seek to determine exactly what sort of hybrid cars can be sold after 2030, by which point pure-electric cars are currently scheduled to make up 80% of the market and pure-petrol and -diesel models are to be taken off sale.",

    "description": "One of the oddest news reports in recent memory was the announcement that Ducati, a brand synonymous with lusty Italian sportbikes, was planning to enter the world of motocross. A race-ready prototype of their contender broke cover soon after, before being fielded in a handful of events throughout the course of last year. Now the Borgo Panigale brand has unveiled the production version of their first-ever motocross bike—the Ducati Desmo450 MX—and we’re intrigued. The most pertinent question is why the almost 100-year-old marque is diversifying, and why they’ve chosen the world of off-road racing as their next stomping ground. Ducati CEO Claudio Domenicali’s official statement offers reasons (once you’ve waded through the marketing speak). “Over the past 18 months many people have asked me why Ducati decided to enter the world of professional off-road racing,” he says.…",

    "description": "Maruti Suzuki and Honda have given their compact sedans a significant update, bringing us the fourth-generation Dzire and the third-generation Amaze, respectively. Can these sedans carry on the fight in an increasingly SUV-dominated market? With these new-gen models, both brands have also placed a strong emphasis on safety this time around. Standard features on both cars now include ESP, six airbags and hill-start assist. Additionally, the Amaze stands out with its camera-based ADAS suite, while the Dzire has earned a 5-star Global NCAP crash-safety rating. And now, with similar features and specifications, the two sedans are closer than ever. So, we put their petrol-automatic iterations through our exhaustive tests to find out which one comes out on top. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire exterior design Amaze boasts a higher ground clearance and a longer wheelbase. The Amaze follows Honda’s latest design philosophy, bearing a strong resemblance to its larger siblings. Its front shares styling cues with the Elevate SUV, while the rear resembles the City. Though the side profile remains unmistakably Amaze, elements such as door-mounted mirrors and 185/60 R15 diamond-cut alloys provide a modern touch. The new Dzire impresses with its large Audi-esque grille, and the LED headlamps look sleek. Like the Amaze, its side profile is familiar to its previous generation, but distinctive tail-lights featuring a tri-arrow LED signature and a subtle boot lip spoiler add character. Dzire is taller, but Amaze has a higher ground clearance Dimensionally, both cars are near-identical in length and width, but the Dzire is 25mm taller and rides on slightly higher-profile 185/65 R15 tyres. The Amaze boasts a 20mm longer wheelbase and higher ground clearance (172mm versus Dzire’s 163mm). The Dzire AMT weighs 960kg, making it 26kg lighter than the Amaze. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire interior Honda’s hallmark ergonomics shine through, and its high-set seats result in excellent visibility. With a dashboard that resembles that of an Elevate, the Amaze’s interior adopts a minimalist approach. The beige-black colour scheme adds some brightness, and Honda’s hallmark ergonomics shine through with well-placed storage spaces and excellent visibility. Also carried forward from the Elevate are its superbly executed part-analogue, part-digital instrument cluster and the neat, buttoned climate control console. Where the Amaze must improve is the front-seat comfort; the absence of adequate seat base support becomes glaringly evident in this comparison. Its rear seat fares much better in this aspect – there’s good support, and the backrest angle is more comfortable than the Maruti. Three fixed headrests not only improve comfort but also provide whiplash protection to adults seated here. And while neither of these sedans is wide enough to seat three adults comfortably, the Amaze’s rear air-con console protrudes a fair bit into the middle passenger’s kneeroom. Also, taller passengers will find the headroom in limited supply in the Amaze. Dzire interior feels more spacious and comfortable Some textured bits enhance its appeal, as do features like a larger screen and sunroof. There’s a greater sense of space inside the Dzire due to its design and lighter colour scheme. Some smartly executed textured bits lift its appeal, while its larger 9-inch touchscreen and a sunroof add a touch of modernity. It also gets an edge over the Amaze due to its broader, more supportive seats. For short drives, its soft cushioning feels very comfortable, too. However, this could induce some body ache after spending extended hours in the car during long drives. Its rear seat is just as accommodating as the Honda’s, but with a bit more headroom due to a scooped-out roof, taller passengers will be comfier here. While both cars have ample storage areas spread across the cabin, the Dzire’s 382-litre boot is a bit smaller than the Amaze’s, which measures 416 litres. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire price and features Amaze (clockwise): Camera-based ADAS works well under most conditions; The front seats’ base is small and needs better support; Rear AC console eats into the kneeroom of passengers; Smooth transmission complements its engine well. The Honda Amaze CVT comes in three variants priced between Rs 9.35 lakh and Rs 11.20 lakh, whereas the Dzire AMT’s range of Rs 8.34 lakh to Rs 10.19 lakh makes it significantly more affordable. The features common to their top trims include auto LED headlamps, 15-inch alloys, keyless entry, wireless charging, automatic climate control, rear air vents, cruise control, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, ESP and six airbags. Dzire (clockwise): Includes in-vogue features like a sunroof and a 360-deg cam; The AMT gearbox’s shifts are jerky; No headrest for the middle passenger; Faux wood, silver inserts and textures enhance its appeal. The Dzire AMT stands out with a 360-degree camera, a sunroof and a larger 9-inch touchscreen (compared to the Amaze’s 8-inch unit). However, during our tests, its screen froze on more than one occasion while connected to Android Auto. Amaze distinguishes itself with ADAS features For the Rs 1 lakh premium that the Amaze CVT commands over the Dzire AMT, it gets paddle shifters, a part-digital instrument cluster, and an ADAS package featuring lane-keeping assist, blind-spot monitoring, autonomous emergency braking and adaptive cruise control. These ADAS features are well-calibrated to suit Indian driving conditions and function in a non-intrusive manner, making highway drives more convenient and safer.

Amaze’s 1.2-litre 4-cylinder petrol engine is carried over from the previous-gen model and, hence, remains very similar in its characteristics. It is an enjoyable unit with a strong mid-range and a free-revving nature. But performance at the lower end of the rev range feels weak, especially below 2,000rpm. Its continuously variable transmission (CVT) keeps the engine spinning optimally, thus extracting the best out of this unit. And in the absence of fixed gears, this belt-pulley automatic works seamlessly. However, enthusiastic user input results in a noticeable rubber-band effect, where the revs increase without a corresponding effect on vehicle speed; this makes an already buzzy engine sound even harsher. Honda’s free-revving mill can get quite vocal when spun faster. The new Dzire switches to Maruti’s latest 1.2-litre Z12E petrol engine that has one less cylinder. And, at 82hp, makes 8hp less than the Amaze as well as its own previous-generation model. However, as we’ve seen with the Swift, where it debuted, this three-cylinder unit’s clear focus on low-end torque aids drivability, as does its crisp throttle response. 5-speed AMT is a sore point for the Dzire's driving experience These make the Dzire feel rather effortless within urban confines. But the 5-speed automated manual transmission (AMT) is the weakest link in this package. Yes, it provides the convenience of clutch-free driving, and even though it can be categorised as fine by AMT standards, you will feel a prominent lag between gear shifts; it is nowhere near as smooth or seamless as the Amaze’s CVT. Maruti’s three-cylinder unit is surprisingly refined and drivable. In our performance tests, the Amaze accelerates from 0-100kph in 13.12 seconds, 2.09 seconds quicker than the Dzire AMT. Interestingly, their rolling acceleration times from 20-80kph and 40-100kph are very similar. Pedal to the metal, the Honda CVT tops out at 148kph, whereas the Dzire AMT hits a higher top speed of 170kph.

Honda claims an ARAI-rated efficiency of 19.46kpl for the Amaze CVT, whereas Maruti claims a staggering 25.71kpl for the Dzire AMT. Although nowhere as close, in our real-world tests, the Amaze CVT and Dzire AMT averaged 13.28kpl and 15.41kpl, respectively. The Amaze CVT achieved 16.62kpl on the highway and 9.94kpl in the city, whereas the Dzire returned a higher 19.22kpl and 11.61kpl, respectively. Notably, neither car gets an Eco mode; the Dzire has an automatic engine stop-start feature to check fuel consumption while idling. However, in extreme 45-degree heat, this feature struggled due to the air conditioning’s higher fan speed requirements to maintain the preset 22 degrees Celsius cabin temperature in full-auto mode. In contrast, the Amaze maintained cabin temperature effectively with a lower fan speed. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire ride and handling The Amaze's steering is more responsive, but the Dzire wins on the low-speed ride front. A comfort-oriented setup makes the Amaze soak up the bumps and road imperfections rather competently, but the sharper potholes come through with a prominent ‘thwack’ from the suspension. At highway speeds, it tends to bounce on its soft springs, resulting in a fair bit of vertical movement over wavy surfaces – not ideal for those prone to road sickness. Dzire's ride is plusher at low speeds The Maruti is the comfier riding car since its low-speed ride is a touch more absorbent, and it does its duties in silence. Sharp movements do come through at highway speeds, so in that sense, its ride can feel busy when you up the pace. However, it recovers much better than the Amaze after a dip, and it doesn’t float as much either. Those who enjoy driving may prefer the Honda’s steering, which feels pointier and more fluid than the Maruti’s, but in terms of steering effort, the Dzire’s lighter unit, with its relatively shorter turning radius, will appeal to most buyers. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire verdict Honda Amaze ZX CVT: 8/10 Maruti Dzire ZXi+ AMT: 8/10 The Honda Amaze petrol-automatic gets the basics right with a far smoother driving experience and better outright performance, which will certainly appeal to self-driven owners. In addition, it is also equipped with segment-first ADAS. However, its powertrain could have done with better refinement, its front seats should have been more supportive, and its highway ride comes across as a bit bouncy. The Maruti Dzire isn’t perfect, and the jerky AMT gearbox is a letdown, but if you can look past this, it feels larger and more expensive on the inside, and its seats are comfier, too. The ride is plusher, the engine more refined, and it has a more desirable kit, including a sunroof and a 360-degree camera. Building the case further is the better fuel efficiency and a substantial Rs 1 lakh lower sticker price. All in all, then, the Dzire is the better all-rounder, ensuring it emerges the winner in this battle. Also see: Maruti Dzire vs Honda Amaze: Which is the new compact sedan for you?

These models struggled to stay competitive against more powerful and feature-rich alternatives. The G 310 R and G 310 GS were part of a joint venture between TVS and BMW and served as entry-level bikes. Production of both stopped in January 2025. With generous year-end discounts, it’s unlikely there’s any unsold stock. While the G 310 R has been removed from BMW's website, the G 310 GS is still listed, indicating some remaining availability.  Moving forward, BMW will be actively offering only the G 310 RR, which is based on the TVS Apache RR 310 with BMW branding and livery. It continues to be powered by the same 312cc, liquid-cooled, single cylinder producing 34hp and 27Nm. This motor was part of the joint venture and post this discontinuation, this engine continues to live on in the TVS Apache RR 310, RTR 310 and the previously mentioned BMW G 310 RR.

    "description": "McLaren Automotive is all set to merge with British start-up company Forseven. With fresh capital, technology and resources at hand, McLaren will now be looking to expand beyond its current lineup of just mid-engined supercars for the first time. The deal was announced on April 3, 2025. McLaren and Forseven to integrate under new McLaren Group Holdings McLaren to expand into new product categories beyond supercars Merger was facilitated by investment company CYVN Holding Who is Forseven? Forseven is a British start-up which had been building a team of automotive designers, engineers and executives towards the launch of a new range of luxury models under a new brand. All this development was happening in the background for the last three years, which the company is referring to as operating in ‘stealth mode’. However, the Forseven name was never intended to be a customer-facing name, and will now cease to exist post this merger. Prior to the McLaren deal, it had been Forseven’s intention to go to market as its own brand, albeit with a different name. Merger facilitated by CYVN Holdings The merger between McLaren and Forseven was facilitated by the Abu Dhabi government-backed investment company CYVN Holdings. It formed Forseven as an anchor investment in 2022, and has expanded its automotive portfolio since then. It currently owns Gordon Murray Technologies which it acquired in 2023, and also has a 20 percent stake in Chinese car company Nio. CYVN acquired McLaren Automotive in December 2024. New McLaren Group Holdings constituted The new combined company, McLaren Group Holdings Ltd, will be led by Forseven CEO Nick Collins. Collins has previously been a senior engineer at Ford and later, he has also overseen the Defender and Range Rover projects at JLR. The new McLaren Group Holdings will oversee the combined business of McLaren Automotive and Forseven. The new Group also has a minority, non-controlling stake in the McLaren Formula 1 team. What does this mean for McLaren? The merger will enable the newly formed McLaren Group Holdings to broaden its model line-up. Essentially, this will enable the models in development at Forseven to come to market under the McLaren badge. Meanwhile, McLaren will benefit from fresh financial backing and security better compete with the likes of Ferrari, Lamborghini, Aston Martin and Bentley. This also includes electrification know-how from Nio and GMT’s advanced production processes. The first official details of the new-era McLarens will be revealed later this year. Speaking to our sister publication Autocar UK, Collins declined to go into the specifics of any particular model, but said the new range of cars will move up in their price points from the existing lineup, making for a much broader portfolio than today. Intriguingly, the models that have been in creation at Forseven are not solely electric, and McLaren’s expansion into other segments will include high-performance internal combustion engines.
