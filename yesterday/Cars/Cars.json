    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/aston-martin-vantage-roadster-brings-656bhp-v8",
    "description": "New Vantage Roadster will dispatch 0-62mph in 3.5sec New model is one of the most powerful drop-top sports cars on sale, thanks to Mercedes-AMG-derived engine The new Aston Martin Vantage Roadster is one of the most powerful drop-top sports cars on sale following an extensive, performance-focused upgrade. With 656bhp and 590lb ft from a reworked version of the existing twin-turbocharged 4.0-litre V8, the new Roadster packs substantially more power than its 505bhp predecessor and has been set up to be a more dynamic proposition. Now more powerful than rivals such as the Porsche 911 Carrera 4 GTS Cabriolet and Ferrari Roma, the Aston’s new power levels even push it to vie with some models in the class above, such as the Maserati MC20 Cielo and McLaren Artura Spider. The new drop-top follows the coupé that was launched nearly a year ago and was described by Aston as “the most driver-focused and fastest Vantage in the famous nameplate’s 74- year history”. The Vantage Roadster draws power from the same Mercedes-AMG-derived powerplant as the coupé. Although the convertible is 60kg heavier, due to its extra rigidity bolstering and roof mechanics, it can still match its sibling in a straight line with a 0-62mph time of 3.5sec. Top speed for both is limited to 202mph. That makes it as fast as the outgoing 690bhp V12 Vantage Roadster, the most powerful drop-top Aston has produced to date. The car’s pace is the result of an “extensive” overhaul of its V8. Aston has added new cam profiles and larger turbos, tweaked compression ratios and improved cooling. The firm has also adjusted the ratios and calibration of the eight-speed automatic gearbox for “punchier” in-gear acceleration and quicker gearchanges. To improve driving dynamics, the aluminium chassis has been stiffened and work has been done to keep the car at a near-50:50 weight distribution. As before, double wishbones are fitted at the front and multi-link at the rear. Aston claims the car’s rear end is up to 29% stiffer under load, to the benefit of handling and driver feedback. New bespoke-tuned Bilstein DRX adaptive dampers also increase responsiveness. There is a choice of steel or carbon-ceramic brakes and its standard 21in alloy wheels are shod with bespoke Michelin Pilot Sport S 5 AML tyres. Aston claims the new convertible has the fastest-folding roof on sale today. The cloth top opens or closes in just 6.8 seconds and can be operated at road speeds of up to 31mph. For comparison, the Roma Spider’s takes 13.5 seconds. The new car is visually marked out from its predecessor by a revised front end – notably with a larger grille – and a 30mm increase in width. Inside, it mirrors the Vantage Coupé, which ushered in a completely new cockpit arrangement. The cabin gets a 10.25in touchscreen, wireless smartphone mirroring and an array of buttons, switches and dials for the most used functions. Pricing has yet to be announced, but Autocar understands it will start at around £175,000, a £10,000 premium on the coupé. Deliveries begin in April.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-2025-dacia-bigster-undercuts-suv-rivals-%C2%A324995",
    "description": "Entire Bigster range comes in below £30k as firm aims to steal a big chunk of Europe's biggest car segment The new Dacia Bigster SUV is available to pre-order now for less money than a Volkswagen Golf.  The Romanian firm's largest model yet starts at just £24,995 - nearly £3000 less than the cheapest Golf and far below the list price of many of its closest rivals. The Nissan Qashqai, for example, starts at £30,135, the Ford Kuga at £33,395 and the Skoda Kodiaq at £38,720. The Bigster is priced closer to the likes of the smaller Vauxhall Frontera, MG ZS and Omoda 5. The headline-baiting entry price is for Expression trim, which includes 17in alloy wheels, a 10.1in touchscreen, dual-zone air con, a multi-view camera and front and rear parking sensors.  Mid-rung Journey trim bumps the list price up to £26,245 for its larger 19in wheels, electric tailgate and bespoke interior upholstery, while Extreme comes in at £26,494 with its panoramic sunroof, modular roof bars, washable microfibre upholstery and rubber floor mats. Both Journey and Extreme trims provide a heated steering wheel, heated front seats, wireless phone chargers, adaptive high-beam headlights, electric door mirrors, rear privacy glass and the option of a contrasting black roof. The Bigster is available with a choice of three powertrains: the pure-petrol TCe 130, mild-hybrid petrol TCe 140 and Hybrid 155. Prices top out at £29,495 for the Hybrid 155 Extreme, keeping the entire range under £30,000. Speaking to Autocar ahead of the Bigster's price list going public, Dacia CEO Denis Le Vot explained the rationale behind pricing the Bigster so attractively. \"If you take the C-segment SUV market today in Europe, these cars are trading now for €35,000-36,000 as an average real price paid by the client, and it was below €30,000 five years ago,\" he said.  \"So starting in 2025, you're going to have 2.5 million people every year coming to the dealership to replace their C-SUV and being offered the new 2025 version for €35,000, €36,000, €37,000... And these guys were buying it for €29,000 or €28,000 five years ago, so there's going to be a disappointment. \"So if we take just a slice of this: bingo! And I'm very confident that there will be enough people to consider the Bigster.\" To make room for the Bigster to start running down the line at Dacia's plant in Mioveni, Romania, Dacia has moved production of the Sandero hatchback and Jogger MPV to a Renault facility in Morocco and opened up some capacity to build some Dusters in Turkey. Despite the Bigster being 227mm longer than the closely related Duster, it doesn't gain the option of seven seats, unlike the Kodiaq and Peugeot 5008. Le Vot said adding a third row would mean \"you have to lose knee radius\" in the second row, plus it would necessitate a reinforced rear axle and incur a hefty weight penalty, \"and if you add more kilograms, you would have to add a more electrified engine and it would cost more.\" He said that around 20-25% of C-segment SUVs in Europe are seven-seaters but going after this market would mean \"having a less good five-seater\" and so there are no plans for a seven-seat Bigster. Dacia Bigster: engines, design and interior The Bigster sits on the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance's CMF-B platform, which is shared with the Duster, Sandero, Jogger and Clio. As a result, it is being launched with a mix of electrified powertrains. The flagship Hybrid 155 pairs a 107bhp four-cylinder petrol engine with two electric motors (a 50bhp motor and a high-voltage starter-generator) and a 1.4kWh battery. The Bigster is the first Renault Group car to be fitted with this set-up. Outputting 153bhp via a six-speed automatic gearbox, it is the most powerful Dacia model to date. The firm also claims it can be driven in pure-EV mode 80% of the time. The TCe 140 combines a 138bhp 1.2-litre three-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine with a 48V mild-hybrid system. At the foot of the range is the TCe 130, which is also used by the smaller Duster but features four-wheel drive. Both are available with a six-speed manual gearbox only. Inside, the Bigster majors on “space, ergonomics and comfort”, according to Dacia. New features – such as thicker glass, improved acoustic padding, adjustable seats and dual-zone climate control – have been added to “meet the expectations of customers” looking for a C-segment SUV. The high-mounted dash is dominated by a 10.1in central touchscreen, which gets smartphone mirroring as standard. A huge 667 litres of seats-up boot space puts it on a par with the similarly sized Kodiaq and 5008. Commenting on the launch of the Bigster, Dacia design boss David Durand said: \"For the C-segment, you need a car that stands out, so its good to be a bit different by coming with a tough-looking car that is spacious, but also that has functionality to appeal to buyers. And it goes well with our affordable positioning, too. \" \"A rugged design makes sense for us becuase we want our cars to be used as a tool. I have an old Land Rover Series II and for me this is the perfect example of a rugged, reliable tool that you can use everywhere. This is the type of design that I love and I try to apply to our cars becuase we want people to feel proud in our cars, and you don't always need to have a super expensive car to look good,\" he added.",

The UK-based builder parted out an Aprilia RSV-R he was trying to sell for a turbocharged Suzuki Bandit 1200, and started a long, expensive journey. Despite its laughably lame name, the Bandit 1200 became a cult bike in the UK in a way that was never really replicated elsewhere. Following the 600 cc Suzuki Bandits, and smaller 250s and 400s that were never officially imported, the 1200 launched in the UK in 1996 as a naked street bike.…",

    "description": "The Maruti Swift has been a part of our fleet for a couple of months now, during which it’s been a ‘fill it and forget it’ type of car. While its fuel efficiency may be its biggest draw for most in the office, I’ve discovered a few more virtues of the Swift in the time I’ve spent with it. The seat comfort and the driving position are absolutely spot on. First, it’s just so easy to drive and live with. The compact dimensions and light controls mean it’s effortless to operate, and its relatively affordable price tag (compared to the BMWs, Mercs and Audis in our fleet currently) means I don’t have to be stressed out about where I take it and where I park it. Then, of course, there’s the fuel efficiency. It’s actually down from Jay’s 14.2kpl to 13kpl – pardon my enthusiastic driving for that. But that’s still very good, given the traffic on my route to the office. Presence of a centre armrest would’ve added to the comfort. The reason for the enthusiastic driving is the gearbox and the steering. Sure, the engine lacks punch, but the smooth shifts and light clutch mean you don’t mind rowing through the gears. The steering is precise and feelsome. Living in Mumbai, I prefer the automatic version of a car, but it’s the complete opposite with the Swift. Smooth shifts, light clutch mean you don’t mind driving in traffic. What adds to the driving experience is the driver’s seat – there’s the right amount of support and plenty of adjustability, which makes it easy to find your ideal driving position. I also like that the driver’s seat goes really low, as that’s how I prefer to sit. Speaking of some things I’ve missed in the Swift, the presence of a centre armrest would’ve really added to the comfort factor. I’m sure there are some aftermarket solutions for that, but it would’ve been nice to see it from the factory. There’s also no tyre pressure monitor, and I recently found out why it’s an important bit of kit. On a shoot, one of my colleagues noticed that the rear right tyre was looking under inflated unbeknownst to me. A screw turned out to be the culprit and, thankfully, there was a repair shop close by to fix it. No TPMS means it takes time to realise that there’s a puncture. Other than that, the Swift is a hard car to fault – it’s no wonder, then, that it’s as successful as it is. Being the master of efficiency, it has been tough keeping a hold of the Swift’s keys for long, and it now has a new custodian. Hopefully, I can get it back soon to see what it’s like on a long road trip and tell you more about its highway efficiency, boot space, and rear-seat comfort.

    "description": "Kia India will bring the Carnival Hi Limousine, based on the recently launched Carnival, to the Auto Expo 2025. The Carnival Hi Limousine has a luxurious seating layout replete with a high-roof setup aimed at chauffeur-driven customers.  Carnival Hi Limousine gets a 21.5-inch roof-mounted TV It has a custom high-roof setup for more headroom It is equipped with a 290hp V6 petrol engine Kia Carnival Hi Limousine takes on the Vellfire overseas The Kia Carnival Hi Limousine 4-seater has been specially designed for extraordinary comfort levels and offers oodles of space and adjustments. It is on sale in markets like South Korea and Singapore, where it rivals the likes of the Toyota Vellfire, which, too, has a luxurious, passenger-focused interior. Like the Vellfire, the decked-out Carnival has two large “premium captain’s chairs” in the second row, each of which gets a high-quality Nappa leather surface with a 3D quilted design. Typical to most limousine seats, these also come with an extended leg support. These seats get individual picnic tables and a range of electric adjustments, which can be controlled by a touchscreen remote display. This display can also adjust the AC, cabin lights and curtains and serve as a remote for the large 21.5-inch LED TV mounted on the roof just behind the front row. It also gets armrests for both seats, with a console housing a wireless charging pad and heated/cooled cup holders. What’s more, the second-row passengers also get a foot massager for themselves. Kia says that it has specifically developed this foot massager in collaboration with Hu-Tech, a healthcare company, to provide a relaxing experience to the passengers. The luxury MPV also has special storage for shoes and a heated or cooled cabinet with individual cup holders for cold or hot drinks for both passengers. In the cargo hold, space has been optimised with a ceiling-mounted hanger and storage boxes under the floor. On the outside, the Carnival Hi Limousine gets additional chrome bits, a unique alloy wheel design and additional side steps for the front and rear passengers.

    "description": "Remember the new Hero Destini 125? Yes, the one we rode almost six months ago. Well, Hero has finally launched the scooter, with prices starting at Rs 80,450 for the base VX variant. The Destini is available in three variants, and Hero claims a 59kpl mileage figure for the model.  The Destini 125 gets an all-new design Three variants are available  It runs on 12-inch wheels at both ends Hero Destini 125 launch details The Destini is powered by the same air-cooled, 124cc, single-cylinder mill making 9hp and 10.4Nm of torque, mated to a CVT gearbox. While this engine is the same as the one on the previous Destini, Hero has made a lot of internal changes to help improve refinement, resulting in lower NVH levels. Another big mechanical change is that the Destini 125 now rolls on 12-inch wheels at both ends, just like the Xoom. With this generation change, the top ZX variants also come with a 190mm front disc, another first for the Destini. The under-seat storage on the Destini 125 can hold 19 litres. Hero has equipped the Destini with a lot of new features in this generation, such as auto-cancelling indicators, a boot light, and backlit switchgear. The bike also gets Hero’s patented i3S start/stop tech, which would have played a role in helping the Destini achieve the claimed 59 kpl mileage figure.   The base VX variant comes with a front drum brake and a digital-analogue dash, while the higher ZX variants get a front disc and a fully digital, Bluetooth-compatible display. All variants come with dedicated colour schemes, and the ZX variants get different types of chrome finishes.  The most affordable variant of the Destini is the VX, priced at Rs 80,450, followed by the mid-ZX variant at Rs 89,300, and finally, the range-topping ZX+ variant at Rs 90,300. Rivals to the Hero Destini 125 include the popular Suzuki Access 125, TVS Jupiter 125, Yamaha Fascino 125, and Honda Activa 125. Also See:  Hero Destini 125 review: Destined to succeed?

    "description": "The 2024 Kawasaki KLX230 marks a significant entry into the Indian market as the first road-legal Japanese dual-sport. On paper this bike is designed to cater to off-road enthusiasts who might also want to use the bike for urban commutes, offering a blend of rugged performance and everyday usability. I’ve spent significant time riding the KLX230 through the broken streets of Mumbai, some local trails and a couple of highway stints. Here’s what I’ve discovered during that time. The KLX230 embodies a true dual-sport aesthetic with its slim profile, minimal bodywork, 21-inch front and 18-inch rear wheels and towering stance. The overall design looks purposeful and eye-catching, especially in this shade of lime green. A small issue that triggered my OCD was how much of a dirt magnet this dual-tone seat was as it showed signs of discolouration very early on in its life.   Taillight looks rather old and retro This dual-sport is rather sparsely equipped for its price and is as barebones as it gets for a road-legal machine. You get an LCD screen that displays only the basics like a speedometer, odometer, trip meter and fuel gauge. If I was nitpicking, I would have liked a rev counter and a distance-to-empty indicator to aid with any extended trail rides. The switchgear is also simple in design and misses out on a pass light switch. Our test unit also had an unresponsive ABS button. However, these are minor issues that hardly ever hindered my overall experience with this motorcycle. On paper, the KLX230 is no powerhouse, but in the real world, it feels surprisingly engaging and quick. This 233cc air-cooled motor packs sufficient torque and low-end grunt for everyday riding while also being easy to handle for new riders. The 7.6 litre tank is small but the KLX230 is quite fuel efficient. Throughout my time, the KLX230 rarely ever felt underpowered or slow. Unlike its closest rival Hero, the KLX230 is a much more lively experience and rewards you with a loud exhaust that barks and pops. The short gearing works rather well off-road and in the city. The 6-speed gearbox has you constantly shifting gears to stay in the meat of the powerband, adding yet another layer of involvement. In our tests, the KLX230 showed in-gear acceleration figures that were quicker than even the KTM 250 Duke. It is also 2 seconds faster from 0-100kph than the Xpulse 200 4V, thanks to its massive 20kg weight advantage. It’s also worth noting that this motorcycle hits a top speed of 121kph in 6th gear with the engine at the rev limiter.  Despite being so engaging, this motor is also quite refined and even returns some good fuel efficiency. In our tests, the KLX230 managed to give us a respectable figure of  42kpl on the highway and 39kpl in the city. However, it is worth mentioning that the KLX230 isn’t the best commuter and its sharp throttle and eagerness to jump off the line do require more restraint in bumper-to-bumper traffic. On the highway, the KLX230 can comfortably cruise at 80kph and perhaps even hold 100kph if you can bear the wind and vibration. While its 7.6-litre tank is rather small, the fuel-sipping nature means you can still comfortably get over 200km on a tankful. While the 880mm seat height may appear quite daunting on paper and in person, the soft suspension allows riders that are even 5’8” to flatfoot while in the saddle. Shorter riders who are heavier can certainly take advantage of this setup or opt for an optional lower seat. Speaking of which, I found the seat comfort adequate for shorter rides but pillion comfort is non-existent due to the seat’s narrow shape and lack of cushioning. For the rider, most of the cushioning is right upfront which may provide some comfort but leaves you in a more aggressive riding position. The standing ergonomics also seem better suited for shorter riders and left me feeling a little restricted. Instead, I preferred sitting right behind the tank while off-road, giving me much better control. The non-adjustable suspension provides 240mm of front and 250mm of rear travel, effectively absorbing bumps and ensuring a relatively comfortable ride. At this price, an adjustable fork would have been a nice addition. Thanks to its 139kg weight, the KLX230 is a boon to handle and muscle around off-road. It feels agile and can be quite forgiving, allowing for quicker and easier corrections while off-road. It’s also a hoot to jump and glides over most humps or bumps on the road. It only takes a particularly deep pothole at higher speeds to break its stride. The KLX230 is also a comfortable motorcycle for most commutes, hindered only by its ergonomics.  The MRF tyres performed well enough but a better set of dual-sport tyres would enhance its capabilities both on and off-road. While the braking performance is decent, the way it happens may trigger a sense of basophobia. Due to the soft front suspension, even a mild tap at the lever can make the front end dive down dramatically. This was particularly scary under hard or emergency braking conditions, despite the fact that the motorcycle reliably comes to a halt. While initially concerning, this soft setup eventually got more predictable and stopped being as bothersome towards the end.   At Rs 3.30 lakh (ex-showroom, India), on paper, the KLX230 doesn’t offer great value. Factor in the limited service network and potentially expensive spare parts, this isn’t a motorcycle you would want to damage. However, if you’re willing to accept those things, what you’re getting is a friendly dual-sport that is exciting to both look at and ride. Plus you get the peace of mind of having a piece of reliable Japanese engineering in your garage that is built to outlast you. Another silver lining is the plethora of after-market accessories available for you to tweak the KLX to your liking and potentially solve any above-mentioned shortcomings. So if your pockets are deep enough, the KLX makes a fun yet versatile bike to add to your garage.",

    "description": "[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgUU5nb1jAw[/embed] The attraction to automobiles does not always pertain entirely to a physical quality. Sure, a car’s design, or its smell, or its sound can be part of that attraction, but a bigger part lies within something more abstract. If there was ever anyone who could relate to such an emotion, it would be Rob Simon. His steed of choice has been, and always will be, the legendary BMW E30 M3. In the automotive space, the legendary Bavarian warrior needs no introduction or backstory. It has long been heralded as one of the most exceptional machines ever sculpted by mankind, offering a pure driving experience unmarred by unnecessary aids or features. Despite a near-death experience in his red E30 M3, Rob always lusted for another one. It wasn’t just the behind-the-wheel time he longed for but the deeper, unspoken connection it wove between him, his father, and his brother, all of which had E30 M30s of their own.
