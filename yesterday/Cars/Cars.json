    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/subaru-hints-sti-revival-performance-car-push",
    "description": "Brand’s European boss says “we need to bring sportiness back to Subaru” Subaru is planning to offer performance models in its future full electric line-up – which could include new sports cars in the vein of the Impreza STI and BRZ. The brand gained a huge cult following for its rally-honed performance machines in the early 1990s, and also enjoyed success with the BRZ sports car that was launched in 2012 as a twin to the Toyota GT86.  In recent years the firm has focused its efforts on rugged SUVs, and has withdrawn all of its performance models from Europe due to emissions regulations.  But speaking at the unveiling of the new Trailseeker EV at the New York Auto Show, Subaru Europe boss David Dello Stritto said that “there are plans to bring back the sportiness in Subaru”.  While he declined to elaborate on specifics, he added: “If you ask me to sum up what Subaru means for customers in Europe right now, it’s three letters: SFT - safe, fun and tough. Those values are why our customers in Europe are loyal and keep coming back to us.  “But there’s a fourth pillar I’ve been missing to sell in Europe for the last 10 years and that’s P, for power and performance. Ask the average person what Subaru means and they’ll say STI. You can’t disassociate this from Subaru. “So we need to bring sportiness back to Subaru. Right now, we couldn’t do it: Europe says you can’t, because you have a GPF [gasoline particulate filter] that can literally choke your engine.” That issue won’t be a problem for electric cars, and Subaru is already looking at what it can do in the electric performance sphere having shown off the radical, 1073bhp STI E-RA in 2022. Dello Stritto said: “With an EV you’ve got the power and performance, and you’ve got an all-wheel drive system. We’re working on more sporty models, and electrification allows us to do this. “Let's face it, it's nice to have that prospect of a future WRC STI – super-fast, gold wheels, blue colour. This is what we want, at the end of the day.” Subaru currently has a partnership with Toyota to jointly develop electric cars: its first EV, the Solterra - which was recently updated – is based on the bZ4X and the new Trailseeker EV uses the same jointly developed platform.  While Subaru is due to start producing its new EVs from 2028 onwards, the partnership with Toyota is set to continue, raising the prospect that the two firms could share a platform for a future sports car, as they did with the BRZ and GT86.  Toyota has already shown off a future electric sports car concept in the form of the FT-SE. The Japanese brand is also developing a new 2.0-litre engine that would help hybridised GR sports cars so they can be sold in greater numbers in markets such as Europe where emission regulations limit sales. Asked by Autocar if this relationship could help with the development of a future Subaru performance car, Dello Stritto said “of course, yes”, although he declined to comment if that would be with technological development or a full model.",

    "description": "We pick the very finest hybrid SUVs on the road, with compact, family and luxury models all making the cut Looking for a practical SUV that balances power, efficiency, and eco-conscious driving? A hybrid is the smart choice. In a market divided between petrol and electric, hybrid SUVs deliver a winning mix of both. At their best, they offer some of the the fuel savings associated with an electric car, teamed with the steadfastness of a combustion engine. They're also a hit with company car drivers thanks to lower benefit-in-kind tax rates, making them a savvy financial pick too. This list comprises of regular hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUVs. Plug-in hybrid tech works especially well in SUVs, where there's space to fit batteries and motors without sacrificing too much practicality or comfort. While regular hybrid SUVs are less economical, but are typically cheaper to buy and don’t need to be plugged in. Topping our list is the Skoda Kodiaq. Our testers were impressed with its comfort, practicality and its 71 miles of electric-only range. Keep reading to dive into our top picks and we’ll help find the right hybrid SUV for you.",

One workshop that knows how to turn a sow’s ear into a purse; STG Tracker. Run by Marcelo Obarrio and Germán Karp, the Argentinian outfit is versatile and seldom builds the same thing twice. So they didn’t blink when a client asked them to turn his 1981 Yamaha XV920R into a scrambler.

    "description": "You are probably already familiar with the Suzuki Access 125 because it is a common sight on our roads. Ever since its launch in India in 2007, the Access has been an extremely popular choice in the 125cc scooter category because it offers a practical, efficient and ultra-reliable scooter experience combined with zippy performance for a decent price. In nearly two decades, this is only the second major update the Access has received. So, what has Suzuki changed? Catering to this end of the Indian scooter market is tricky because traditional consumers identify with the established body style that is prevalent, but, at the same time, the company needs to keep its product fresh against its rivals. Which is why Suzuki has not strayed very far from the previous Access’ design ethos. The underseat storage space has grown by 2.6 litres to 24.4 litres. Park the old and new scooters side by side, and the 2025 model looks just new enough to differentiate itself but not so much that the average consumer will mistake it for anything else. We think the Access manages to cut a pleasing figure with its neo-retro aesthetic, and this shade of sea green only helps things further. It has two front cubbies now, but their opening is rather narrow. While not much is new in terms of features and technology, the 2025 Access has improved upon its predecessor in the storage capacity. The boot measures 24.4 litres (up from 21.8), and this scooter now has two slim cubbies on the front apron. Do bear in mind that these cubbies have a rather slender opening, and you cannot fit a 1-litre water bottle like you could in the previous scooter’s single cubby.   The Suzuki Access is very much a family scooter, but unlike most of its rivals, it never feels dull to ride. And its fun character doesn’t come at the expense of any sacrifice in practicality or handling. True to its family-scooter roots, the Access has a plush suspension setup, which never feels out of sorts unless you turn up the wick to the point where seldom any staid rider will venture. Neutral ergos, a spacious seat and balanced suspension keep you comfy. For 2025, Suzuki has given the Access a new frame and heavily reworked the engine – we will address the chassis first and the motor a little later. To be perfectly frank, ride this 2025 model and a previous-gen scooter back to back, and you will be hard-pressed to tell the difference – we actually did just that, so you can take our word for it. That’s really no bad thing because the 106kg Access feels light in traffic (despite its weight having gone up by 2 kilos) and is manageable for riders of all sizes, both attributes expected of a family scooter. Seat has grown slightly longer, and cushioning is on the firmer side. However, for all that has changed, we would have liked to see a 12-inch rear wheel on the Access with this update. Because it still rides on an archaic 10-inch unit (just like it did way back in 2007), at higher speeds and while going through turns, the Access doesn’t feel as stable as its Indian rivals that use 12-inch wheels at both ends (think TVS Jupiter 125 and Hero Destini 125).   That small gripe aside, we are happy to report that the Access retains its zippy, playful demeanour. And a big part of that is down to the tried and tested 124cc engine. This mill is energetic right from the get-go. Even if you’re holding a steady 70kph on the highway, if you open the throttle, there’s still enough left in reserve to manage a reasonably quick and effortless overtaking. Heavily revised engine retains its pep and turbine-smooth character. By and large, Japanese engines are known to have two major USPs: refinement and reliability. As for the former, the most vibration is actually felt only when you are at a standstill, as is typical for scooters. It disappears as soon as you get moving. In fact, it is so smooth that even at an indicated 90kph, there is absolutely no buzz either in the floorboard or the handlebar. Disc brake is reserved for the top two variants and has sufficient bite. In our tests, the new Access was quicker than the BS6 version in roll-on acceleration as well as the sprint to 80kph, which is impressive considering it is a little heavier now and has to comply with stricter emissions norms. Moreover, along with its energetic performance, the Access continues to have great fuel efficiency. In fact, these numbers could have been even better if the Access had start/stop tech like the Burgman, but you can’t opt for that feature here.   The 2025 Access has stuck to the same formula as its predecessor but with minor refinements all across. While it doesn’t have any one standout feature, it blends frugality, practicality and comfort with a dash of zippiness wonderfully. Another important factor to consider is that Suzukis are generally light on the pocket to purchase as well as run, which now brings us to the price. Round chrome mirrors look nice, but the field of view isn’t the best. With prices ranging from Rs 81,700 to Rs 93,300, the new Access is Rs 1,000-1,500 more expensive than the outgoing model. It is also nearly on par with competitors in pricing. The aforementioned factors are why the Access has achieved such widespread success. Even today, if you’re in the market for a new 125cc scooter, the Access remains a really compelling option. Also See: 2025 Suzuki Access video review",

    "description": "Two of the most compelling options in the mid-capacity category in India are the 2025 KTM 390 Adventure and the Royal Enfield Himalayan 450. While both bikes promise adventure-ready capabilities, they take different approaches to design, features, performance and ride quality. However, the most significant difference between the two is their price, and we’re here to tell you if the new kid on the block justifies its higher price tag. Form and function The latest KTM 390 Adventure embraces a more rugged ADV-focused design. While it appears more premium than its predecessor, its underbelly exhaust design deviates from traditional adventure bikes. The KTM’s headlamp easily outshines the RE’s. Available in only two colours, the KTM’s aesthetic may not appeal to everyone, but it does feel modern and carries less visual bulk than the Himalayan. However, the extensive use of plastic panels means you will need to learn to live with buzzes and rattles, something our test bike already had. The RE’s headlamp has adequate illumination. The Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 has less of a traditional ADV aesthetic and instead focuses on a more muscular naked look with a big fuel tank, minimal bodywork and a small windscreen. The larger dimensions, heavier weight and distinct side-stand lean angle make it feel like a bigger motorcycle, but the downside is that this makes it heavy and intimidating for some riders. The Himalayan’s more metal-heavy construction gives it a greater sense of durability and toughness. The 390 Adventure's TFT has a better user interface. Both motorcycles have essential electronics such as a TFT display, switchable ABS and riding modes, but the KTM 390 Adventure goes one step ahead with segment-first features like cruise control, traction control, cornering ABS and dedicated ABS modes. KTM's switchgear feels higher quality and more tactile. The KTM’s user interface is smoother, retains rider preferences even after being switched off, and has a more premium feel with tactile switchgear. Himalayan's circular TFT is legible even on a sunny day. In contrast, the Himalayan 450’s electronics feel less refined. The mode-switching response is inconsistent, and the built-in Google Maps navigation, while excellent in theory, requires an unlocked smartphone screen to function, making it less practical. The Enfield's switchgear doesn't feel nearly as tactile as the KTMs. The toggle switch to browse the menu also feels flimsy and tricky to control, diminishing the user experience. Given these quirks, the KTM’s interface feels more polished and rider-friendly.  Comfort and convenience The KTM 390 Adventure has an upright seating position with wide handlebars, making it comfortable for taller riders. Its slightly forward-leaning stance aids control, while the taller windscreen provides better wind protection. However, the non-adjustable windscreen can be intrusive for some and blocks airflow, making city riding in hot weather uncomfortable. Its LED headlamp is among the best on any Indian motorcycle, significantly outperforming the Himalayan’s. KTM doesn’t offer an alternative to their hard seat. KTM has equipped the 390 Adventure with crash bars, a bash plate and handguards, but the bike lacks a centre stand and has limited luggage-mounting points. While KTM offers optional accessories, the Himalayan takes the lead in customisation. Useful rear rack and optional touring seats make the Himalayan better equipped for a long tour. Royal Enfield offers a wide range of OEM accessories, including luggage options, seat choices and crash protection. It has better standard luggage mounting points, and its tank guard doubles up as an extra mounting location. The optional touring seat is among the most comfortable in its class, making it better suited for long rides. Off the beaten path The KTM 390 Adventure is a significant 13kg lighter than the Himalayan, making it easier to manoeuvre. The lighter weight also helps shorter riders feel more confident in handling the bike, particularly off-road. The KTM’s throttle response is precise, its electronics enhance trail riding, and its brakes offer better control. Thanks to its lighter weight, the KTM is easier to handle off-road. The bi-directional quickshifter is a great addition, making gear shifts seamless – especially when wearing off-road boots. However, the KTM’s suspension struggles with aggressive off-road riding, frequently bottoming out. While KTM offers adjustable suspension, it doesn’t cope as well as the Himalayan, even when firmed up, and most riders would prefer a well-balanced setup out of the box. The Himalayan 450, on the other hand, offers a superior suspension setup that absorbs off-road bumps effortlessly. Despite its heavier weight, it manages low-speed manoeuvres and jumps surprisingly well. The torquey engine is easy to control, and the clutch, though precise, is not as light as the KTM’s. The brakes require careful modulation, as the rear locks up easily. While lacking advanced electronic rider aids, the Himalayan still performs admirably in off-road conditions, handling about 95 percent of what the KTM does and keeping its rider more comfortable while at it. On the open road On highways, the KTM 390 Adventure is more engaging and stable and equipped with cruise control, which is a game-changer for long-distance touring. The KTM shares its main frame and engine with the 2024 KTM 390 Duke, but it features a bespoke rear subframe, swingarm and steering head for enhanced stability. It holds triple-digit speeds effortlessly and accelerates faster than the Himalayan. In our tests, the 390 Adventure was nearly a second quicker to 100kph, while roll-on acceleration is almost on par. The Himalayan 450 offers a more tractable mid-range and better overall comfort. Its plush suspension smooths out rough patches, making it the better option for long-distance touring. It also has a larger fuel tank, improving range. However, the Himalayan’s handlebar vibrates at higher RPMs, leading to numb hands after extended riding. Despite this, the Himalayan performs well as a commuter, with a tighter turning radius and smooth lane-splitting capabilities. Meanwhile, the KTM feels  smooth at highway speeds but has harsh vibrations in the footpegs at lower revs within the city. What took me by surprise were the Himalayan’s braking figures, which were pretty much on par with the KTM’s despite a significantly higher weight. Different strokes for different folks  Both motorcycles present compelling options depending on rider priorities. The KTM 390 Adventure offers lighter weight, superior electronics and stronger performance. The main attraction is that it is lighter and easier to ride than the Himalayan, and it has a chassis that is engaging both on and off the road. On the other hand, the Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 is a more rugged, comfortable and budget-friendly alternative. The KTM is clearly the better adventure bike, but the issue arises when you look at the on-road price difference, which stretches to as much as Rs 80,000-90,000 in Mumbai. If you simply want the KTM’s lighter and friendlier nature, then the lower-spec 390 Adventure X with its 19-inch front wheel is the answer, especially since it costs the same as the Himalayan. However, those willing to pay additional money for the standard 390 Adventure will probably be doing so for the extra edge in off-road performance, and that’s where the KTM’s suspension doesn’t quite match the expectation. That’s why, in this particular comparison, the Himalayan 450 just about wins by a whisker from a value-for-money perspective.

    "description": "As Kia’s flagship SUV, the EV9 stands as the brand’s largest, most luxurious and most technologically advanced model yet. Since it comes to India as a fully imported unit, it is pricey at Rs 1.30 crore ex-showroom. We got a brief opportunity to experience it on Kia’s test track. Here are the first few impressions. Kia EV9 Exterior Plus-sized SUV with impressive aerodynamics Upward sloping window line and sleek LEDs add flair to an otherwise clean design. The EV9 certainly commands attention with its plus-sized proportions and upright stance. It’s larger than the BMW iX and Mercedes-Benz EQE SUV and even boasts a longer wheelbase. The LED daytime running lamps appear to be neatly embedded into the front grille panel. Other interesting design details include bumper flaps that automatically open to cool the battery. The 20-inch wheels are definitely eye-catching as well. Its LEDs appear to be neatly embedded in the bodywork. The EV9 also features flush-type door handles, which, along with the clean body lines, are designed to improve aerodynamics. In fact, the EV9 has a drag coefficient of 0.28, which is impressive for such a large SUV. The upward-sloping window line and sleek LED tail-lamps add flair to the otherwise clean and minimal body styling. While the styling is futuristic and elegant, the paint quality leaves room for improvement, with an evident orange-peel effect on the gloss-black cladding and main body panels. Kia EV9 Interior Comfortable and luxurious, but not German-grade Extremely comfortable captain chairs, with ottomans. Get heating, cooling and a massage function. Step inside the EV9, and you’re met with a sophisticated black and dark brown theme. The dashboard is clean and horizontal, and the throne-like front seats feel luxurious, with comfort being enhanced by ventilation, heating and massaging function options. The EV9 is typically Kia – it impresses and is very well-loaded. The trouble is, at this price point, expectations are high. While the interior feels premium, it’s not to the level of its German rivals; there’s a noticeable use of hard plastics, which detracts from the luxury experience. The 360-degree camera system is clear but lacks the level of detail in the UI presentation and animations that you see at this level. With all three rows in place, 333L boot space is rather respectable. Appreciably, there are physical switches to control fans and temperature for the air-con, as well as a high-quality volume scroller for the infotainment screen. However, all’s not perfect. The dedicated screen for the air-con controls is hidden from the driver’s field of vision, and the row of touchscreen shortcut keys requires serious effort to click and operate. In India, the EV9 is offered only as a six-seater, featuring second-row captain chairs, which, just like the front seats, are extremely luxurious. To start with, they are placed higher than the front seats, so unlike most EVs, you are not seated in a knees-up position. Further, these get electrically powered ottomans as well, and to enhance comfort, they offer heating, cooling and massage functions. However, you can hear all that work, as it’s noticeably loud, but the good news is that it offers a proper high-intensity massage much akin to home massage seats. This function can be activated using a tablet controller, too. While clarity is fine, the camera display lacks detailing in terms of user interface and animations. Middle-row passengers benefit from a dedicated sunroof, sunshades, boss mode to adjust the front passenger seat, a large centre console with a built-in fridge (optional), and wireless charging, to name a few comforts. Access to the third row is easy thanks to the powered captain seat movement. And while headroom is ample even for tall adults, you are forced to sit at an angle to make space for the large (optional) middle-row console. As for boot space, it is rather respectable at 333 litres with all seats up. Of course, it is expandable by folding the third row of seats. A 52-litre front luggage compartment further adds to the practicality. A 52L front loading area further adds practicality.   Kia EV9 Performance, Ride and Handling Brisk performance and even quicker charging capabilities The EV9’s twin motors – one for the front wheels and one for the rear – draw energy from a 99.8kWh battery. Combined, these produce 384hp and 700Nm of torque. As a result, it accelerates briskly. However, you are not pinned to your seat as the power delivery is measured. Based on our GPS-based testing, it accelerated from 0 to 100kph in merely 5.36 seconds, which is respectable for a 7-seater EV weighing over 2.6 tonnes. Even regenerative braking feels quite natural and predictable. Column-mounted drive selector is very easy to use. Kia claims a range of 561km (ARAI-rated), and thanks to its 800V electrical architecture, it supports ultra-fast charging. With a 350kW charger –provided you can find one– its battery can be charged from 10 to 80 percent in just 24 minutes. The EV9 feels mature and composed from behind the wheel. Ride quality, based on a brief stint on Kia’s test track, was surprisingly comfortable even without air suspension (it uses steel springs). Handling is impressive for such a large vehicle, with excellent grip and a reassuring sense of control at high speeds. However, under hard braking, the SUV’s 2.6-tonne mass is noticeable. Handling is impressive for such a large car, with excellent grip and a reassuring sense of control at high speeds.   Kia EV9 Price and Verdict A lot of car for a lot of money The Kia EV9 is spacious, comfortable, luxurious and tech-rich, and it performs well. Middle-row comfort is a major highlight, arguably surpassing what’s offered by rivals like the BMW iX and Mercedes-Benz EQE. That said, at Rs 1.30 crore, the EV9 is priced at par with these two, which, besides their badge, also deliver the whole luxury experience. So, even though the EV9 is a lot of car, it’s a lot of money, and the question is, are you willing to look beyond its badge?

    "description": "The Maruti Suzuki Wagon R has maintained its lead on the sales charts for the fourth year in a row, with 1.98 lakh units sold in the fiscal that ended on March 31, 2025 (FY2025). As we reported at the start of the month, the hatchback outsold the Tata Punch by a narrow 1,969-unit margin. However, a look at the top 10 bestsellers for FY2025 shows the continued dominance of SUVs, with just 3 hatchbacks and 1 sedan in the list. Without digressing further, these were the 10 bestselling cars in India in FY2025, based on SIAM’s wholesale numbers. 10 best-selling cars in FY2025ModelUnits10.Mahindra Scorpio N/Classic1,64,842 9.Maruti Dzire 1,65,021 8.Maruti Fronx 1,66,216 7.Maruti Baleno 1,67,1616.Maruti Swift 1,79,6415.Maruti Brezza 1,89,1634.Maruti Ertiga 1,90,972 3.Hyundai Creta 1,94,8712.Tata Punch1,96,5721.Maruti Wagon R 1,98,451 7 Maruti models among FY2025’s 10 bestsellers  Tata Punch is the bestselling SUV Maruti Ertiga continues as the only MPV on the list 10. Mahindra Scorpio 1,64,842 units With nearly 1.65 lakh units, the Mahindra Scorpio N and Classic together made it to the top 10 and are the only ladder-frame models on the chart. Priced between Rs 13.99 lakh and Rs 24.89 lakh, the Scorpio N comes with strong petrol and diesel engine options paired with a manual or an automatic gearbox and is a rough-and-tough SUV that even has off-road capabilities in 4x4 form. However, its drawbacks include cramped third-row seating and a poorly designed luggage area. Meanwhile, the Mahindra Scorpio Classic has a refined diesel engine and rugged appeal, but at its Rs 13.62-17.50 lakh price range, it lacks features and isn’t a particularly dynamically sound 7-seat SUV. 9. Maruti Dzire 1,65,021 units Despite SUVs continuing to place high on the top 10 sales list, the Maruti Dzire has managed to take the ninth spot with 1,65,021 units. Launched in November 2024, the fourth generation of Maruti’s compact sedan seems to have provided a push in terms of sales. The Dzire is known for its excellent ride and handling and good low-end response from the 1.2-litre petrol engine. However, for the Rs 6.84 lakh-10.19 lakh you pay for it, there are some features missing on top-spec trims, and the rear-seat headroom is a bit of an issue. 8. Maruti Fronx 1,66,216 units The Maruti Fronx has been on an upward trajectory throughout the year, hitting the 2 lakh sales milestone in September and ending the fiscal with 1,66,216 units. The Fronx’s highlights include the space and comfort it offers, along with an appealing design. However, our reviews of this compact SUV priced in the Rs 7.52 lakh-12.88 lakh range have shown that the 1.0-litre turbo-petrol engine option isn’t as punchy as expected, and the SUV also lacks some popular features. 7. Maruti Baleno 1,67,161 units With sales of 1,67,161 units, the Maruti Baleno is the first hatchback to feature in the top 10. It rivals the Tata Altroz and Hyundai i20 and costs Rs 6.70 lakh-9.92 lakh. While the Baleno boasts excellent ride quality and a spacious cabin, it now comes with an AMT gearbox option, which isn’t as smooth as the CVT unit offered previously with the premium hatchback. 6. Maruti Swift 1,79,641 units Maruti Suzuki’s answer to the Hyundai Grand i10 Nios outsold its more premium stable-mate, the Baleno, by a significant 12,480-unit margin, and that’s despite there being a significant price overlap between the two. The Maruti Swift is priced in the Rs 6.49 lakh-9.50 lakh range and is known for its light controls, easy-to-drive nature and impressive fuel economy. The demerits include a lack of punch from the engine. 5. Maruti Brezza 1,89,163 units Maruti’s other compact SUV offering, Brezza, which it retails from the Arena dealerships, witnessed sales of 1,89,163 units. Known for its comfortable ride, practicality and space, the Brezza is on the expensive side for what it offers – it costs Rs 8.69 lakh-14.14 lakh, and its 1.5-litre petrol engine has weak mid-range performance. 4. Maruti Ertiga 1,90,972 units The only MPV in this list is the Maruti Ertiga, which sold just over 1.9 lakh units during the year. Its excellent value proposition, combined with a flexible and practical cabin, has definitely helped its sales. However, the Kia Carens rival lacks some features and doesn’t have a diesel engine option. Ertiga’s prices range between Rs 8.97 lakh and Rs 13.26 lakh. 3. Hyundai Creta 1,94,871 units The popularity of the Hyundai Creta continues, with nearly 1.95 lakh units sold in the April 2024 to March 2025 period, helping the mid-size SUV reach the third spot. It should be noted that the all-electric version, the Hyundai Creta Electric, which launched in January this year, has also helped the sales marginally. This mid-size SUV outsold all its segment rivals – from the Maruti Grand Vitara to Honda Elevate to Skoda Kushaq to Volkswagen Taigun – partly due to the roomy and feature-packed interior. The Creta costs Rs 11.11 lakh-20.50 lakh, and its top-spec variants are pricey. Some plastics used inside could have been of better quality. 2. Tata Punch 1,96,572 units Tata’s smallest SUV was its bestselling model in FY2025, with over 1.96 lakh units sold. Priced from Rs 6.20 lakh to 10.32 lakh, the Tata Punch rivals the likes of the Citroen C3, Maruti Ignis, and the entry-level variants of the Nissan Magnite. This compact SUV boasts attractive packaging, mature driving manners and an elevated seating setup. However, higher variants are pricey, the petrol engine is dull, and the AMT gearbox isn’t the best unit around. 1. Maruti Wagon R 1,98,451 units Maruti’s popular tall-boy hatchback retains the top spot with 1,98,451 units. The Wagon R may not be ideal for highway runs due to its light build and boxy design, but the shape helps it boast a roomy cabin. In urban environs, the Wagon R is also easy to drive and frugal. This Tata Tiago rival is priced between Rs 5.65 lakh and Rs 7.48 lakh. All prices, ex-showroom, India.
