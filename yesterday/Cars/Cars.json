    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/why-zagato-and-touring-see-bright-future-coachbuilding",
    "description": "AGTZ invokes an old car without actually being based on one Italy’s famous coachbuilders aren’t worried about new technology and changing tastes \"It could be the revival of coachbuilding.” Andrea Zagato, CEO of the company bearing his surname, founded in 1919 by his grandfather, is confident. Confident that his specialist industry is fit and ready to not only survive the new automotive era but thrive in it: “The art of coachbuilding is 500 years old, while automotive is around 150. \"We’ve already survived all possible technological shifts. I joined the company in the middle of the crisis of the early ’90s, when other coachbuilders were lost. We survived all of this. So why not a change of technology?” While the romance of automotive coachbuilding was perhaps strongest in its early decades, it stands to win over new audiences a century later, due to two diverging strands: the move to EVs with vastly shared platforms (just look at Ford and Volkswagen buddying up) and the nostalgic response of restomods and their ilk. Whether on fully digitised or wantonly analogue bases, the need for individual designs and finely crafted bodies may be more crucial than ever. “We are case designers,” continues Zagato, “so we concentrate on what you see, what you touch. Whatever technology you provide us beneath, it’s not a big change for us. \"There are several converging trends in the automotive industry, and one is the growing demand for exclusivity. There’s also a standardisation of the components, even in internal combustion cars. \"Stellantis is a prime example: for me, the new Lancia Ypsilon is better-looking than the Peugeot 208, but they’re almost the same underneath. The styling might be the deciding factor for buyers.” Zagato insists that his firm will embrace new technology, rather than fear it. He cites artificial intelligence and 3D stamping as beneficial for its small-scale projects, explaining: “You don’t have to invest thousands of euros in moulds or tooling, because you can quickly build the parts to create one-off and few-off cars. We’re already building many one-offs with 3D stamping.” “We’re living through a technological challenge created by the war between EVs and ICE cars,” he continues. “If electric motors win, the standardisation in the industry will be maximised. I can see a time when you won’t be keen to own a mass-production car; you will rent, use, share. Design may become the main element of differentiation. “People are looking for uniqueness and personal expression. This is bringing us to the point that coachbuilding could be truly back soon. I believe restomods are an intermediate step.” This brings us to the £550,000-plus AGTZ Twin Tail (a collaboration between Zagato and La Squadra, a Polish dealer of collector’s cars), which clothes today’s Alpine A110 in a dramatic skin paying homage to the A220 endurance racer of the ’60s. Two bodystyles are replicated by one car, thanks to an innovatively removable longtail.  Its modern core means it doesn’t fit the true description of a restomod, says Zagato: “It’s a typical coachbuilding job, using inspiration from the past and telling the iconic story of the A220. \"This is a modernisation of the concept. We have airbags and contemporary safety systems on board. We’ve integrated modern technology with timeless design. This is the difference between us and a restomod.” Old and new together Another Italian coachbuilder is making a successful business case for true restomods, though. Last summer, Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera unveiled its Veloce12, which takes an old Ferrari 550 Maranello and endows it with freshened engine, chassis and brake components beneath a reimagined body. “We believe the market for high-end classic cars has seen a shift in buyers to a new generation of product,” says CEO Markus Tellenbach. “Cars from the ’50s or ’60s struggle a bit with younger buyers, which is where cars from the ’90s come into focus.” Many of the £600,000-plus Veloce12s have been sold to American buyers. Its status as a restomod is crucial there, as cars not originally approved for US sale can’t legally be imported for unrestricted road use until they’re 25 years old. “Our concept fits the story of the ’90s analogue car and using a donor means we don’t have to do our own homologation,” confirms Tellenbach. The 30 buyers are split 50/50 between those supplying their own 550 Maranello donor car and those buying the car purely on sight at Monterey Car Week in California. “Our youngest customers are in their late thirties – younger than Touring’s historic age,” reveals Tellenbach. “Making a classic design contemporary and fresh resonates with a new audience.” It seems Touring has tapped into an elusive market frequently chased by mainstream car makers, often in vain. “We aren’t burdened by the rucksack of being consistent with brand values like an OEM,” says Tellenbach. “For a big, established name, it’s tougher to respect all your usual rules and establish brand recognition while also appealing to younger buyers.” Yet the Veloce12 isn’t Touring operating at its purest, he adds: “Making 30 cars in two years is quite an efficient programme for us, all thanks to carbonfibre. With hand-built aluminium, you can’t do that. We love making one-offs or few-offs where the panel-beaters create the car: that’s where our true heart lies. It’s what I want to revive and keep active as a true coachbuilding discipline. Something which fully reflects the craftsmanship that a collector appreciates. “It’s more likely that we will find another way to reinterpret classic beauty than push the envelope on new construction materials. We aren’t scientists; we’re coachbuilders. If I find a friendly OEM with a 12-cylinder, front-engined car who will shake hands with us, you might see a brand-new Touring [rather than a restomod]. \"Maybe today that’s wishful thinking, but tomorrow, who knows? It’s only possible to have access to a brand-new platform when you’re working directly with the company in question.” One such company is Alfa Romeo, whose historical relationship with Touring helped secure the coachbuilder its contract to build the limited-run 33 Stradale supercar. “It has to be done in a co-operative way,” says Tellenbach. “We need a friendly relationship, similar to AMG with Mercedes or Alpina with BMW. That direction surely has a great future.” The companies previously paired up for the gorgeous Disco Volante, a proper coachbuilt ‘case’ atop the 8C Competizione’s platform. “That was designed by Touring and Alfa Romeo liked it so much they asked us to put their badge on it,” says Tellenbach. “Which is great if you like the story between the two brands, these neighbours in Milan, although it’s probably not typical. \"But we’re building the 33 Stradale with a team split almost 50/50 between the two brands. Our old friendship is revived.” And what of the relationship between Touring and another of its famous neighbours, Pininfarina, the Veloce12 essentially being the former’s resketching of the latter’s work? “Some online comments insisted that the original lines shouldn’t be touched,” admits Tellenbach, “but there is no animosity. We have a professional respect for each other’s work.\" Their question over dinner at Monterey was: ‘Does it sell?’” Tailoring and top hats While Automobili Pininfarina is a branch away from the coachbuilding culture of old (as a sibling company of the original Pininfarina design house), its cars are still subject to the same fastidious buyers, as evidenced by the Battista Targamerica, which was also revealed at Monterey, then handed over to “one of our most important clients” by CEO Paolo Dellachà. “It’s not what most of our customers want but a few of them,” he says. “They’re asking us if we can develop them something that isn’t just the usual colours, materials and finishing [CMF] bespoke process – they want to go a step further. \"To realise the first open-roof Battista, for instance. The Battista operates in a sphere where the residual value of the car is more bound to its level of exclusivity than its technology.” Does this represent a chance to return to the coachbuilding roots of Pininfarina that date back to 1930? “I will always be happy to create one-offs and few-offs spun from any of our main models,” answers Dellachà. “Pininfarina has been doing this very extensively in the past. Of course you have to do it in proportion, in the right measure, to avoid becoming specialised only in that. You need to have a solid platform first. Once you have that, there’s more freedom in terms of creating even more outstanding design.” One-offs aren’t necessarily the big profit-booster they can be for more mainstream manufacturers’ special vehicle divisions, however, says Dellachà: “They may cost more to the customer, but these unique cars require additional design, engineering and tooling. \"There’s always a homologation process, even for the Targamerica. It’s not just a show-and-display car [a way to bypass the US’s 25-year rule].” Dellachà joined Automobili Pininfarina in 2023, following lengthy stints at Ferrari and Maserati. “Mostly at those brands, our custom products concerned CMF rather than ‘top hat’ [ie body and interior] modifications,” he says. “Top hat is more of the Pininfarina tradition. “Such coachbuilding is not limited by the technology of the powertrain. You can do it on ICE, hybrid or electric [bases], and the transformation can go from zero to 100 according to the level of bespoke a customer wants to achieve – and the level of money they wish to invest in the process. “With a lot of patience and creativity, we can really thrill our buyer with something that’s exciting at all possible levels – and that’s purely working on design, without touching any of the performance.”",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/dacia-spring-vs-leapmotor-t03-uks-cheapest-evs-face",
    "description": "Small batteries and austere power outputs mean the Spring and T03 are best suited to town The Spring is widely regarded as the value champion but China's Leapmotor is here to fight it – which is better? Electric cars, and new cars in general, are expensive. You know it, we know it, and even though they prefer to draw your attention to attractive-looking finance deals and the potential savings of electric driving, car makers know it. Yes, they do appear to be trying to improve things (while protecting their bottom line, of course) but the various innovative ‘mobility solutions’ have proved to be deeply inadequate for most people and cheap ‘cars’ like the Citroën Ami are a case of being careful what you wish for. We want cheap cars, but not like that. Affordable petrol cars are bad for car makers’ CO2 quotas and, in spite of the demand from customers, are increasingly difficult to make a profit on. Of the five sub-£15,000 cars we gathered together for a group test in 2023, only Dacia’s Sandero remains below that mark today. The situation might be changing, though. The relentless march of progress means that the platforms aimed at developing markets may now be perceived as more acceptable over here. Meanwhile, battery costs are (slowly) coming down. So if you package a modest number of cheaper cells in one of those cheaper platforms, you might actually end up with a very decent yet affordable electric car. That recipe has been used for both the Dacia Spring Electric and the Leapmotor T03. Both are available for well under £20,000, can seat four people, are capable of motorway speeds and exceed 140 miles on the combined cycle. On the face of it, Mini and Honda were asking over £30,000 for the same sort of thing not so long ago. Sounds good, but there is the danger that we’re dealing with the Temu version of the Honda E and Mini Electric here: attractive on paper but horribly compromised in functionality. Dacia Spring vs Leapmotor T03: Design and engineering Encouragingly, both manufacturers are reputable enough to dispel such concerns. Dacia’s reputation speaks for itself by now. The Duster, Sandero and Jogger are brilliant examples of all the car you need, nothing you don’t. It’s not that Dacia reduces a car to its bare essentials but, more significantly, it does the essentials so, so well. The Spring is slightly different. It’s based on the Renault Kwid, which was launched in India in 2015 and gained early infamy for its disastrous crash test results. Since then, it has been updated with better crash structures, airbags, a couple of facelifts and latterly a pack of batteries under the floor. The electric version, which is built in China, is sold as a Renault elsewhere but came to mainland Europe a few years ago as the Dacia Spring. Last year, it had a major facelift to Dacify it further and turn it into a more cohesive product for the European market – including the UK this time. If you compare the Spring we have here with the old one, it might as well be an entirely different car. The Y-shaped light signature and cityscape pattern on the lower grille have really turned budget transport into a cool little city car, even if there is still something awkward-looking about its small-wheeled tippy-toe stance. If you peer through the rear wheel arch, you can actually see the torsion beam for the suspension. We know what a Dacia is, even if it’s actually a Chinese-Indian Renault, but what the hell is a Leapmotor? Fast-moving start-up, China, high-tech electric mobility, yadda, yadda. You’ve heard that sort of thing before, but what makes us all take notice is that Stellantis has a 21% stake in the company and owns 51% of Leapmotor International, a joint venture set up to increase Leapmotor sales outside of China. Not only that, but it has started building left-hand-drive T03s in the Fiat plant in Tychy, Poland. In other words, our Franco-Romanian car is made in China, whereas our Chinese car could have been built in Poland, although right-hand-drive ones continue to come out of China. So Stellantis gives credibility to Leapmotor in the form of brand recognition and a dealer network, but that’s about where the Stellantis involvement ends. The T03 isn’t a cut-down Vauxhall Corsa: it’s a pure Leapmotor development. There’s a battery under the floor, a motor in the front and, like many Chinese cars, a design that is inoffensive but very derivative. If the front has shades of cross-eyed Smart Forfour, from the back it could be absolutely anything. Instead, it draws you in by being apparently overspecced in almost every way, at least on paper. At the UK launch, Leapmotor’s PR team weren’t shy about making comparisons with the Dacia Spring and even brought a static Spring to show just how much better equipped the T03 is for the same price. Indeed, in a game of austerity Top Trumps, the Leapmotor wins easily. It comes in just one spec, and for your £15,995, Leapmotor gives you a 37.3kWh battery, 94bhp and loads of equipment: a fully fledged infotainment system with navigation, adaptive cruise control, blindspot monitoring, a panoramic sunroof and 48kW DC charging. Meanwhile, at Dacia, the same money will buy you a Spring with the upgraded motor (still only 64bhp), a battery of only 26.8kWh, no fast charging, no centre screen and none of that fancy-pants tech. Our test car is in Extreme trim, which adds an infotainment screen, cruise control and 30kW fast charging but is £1000 more. In practice, though, these philosophies are emblematic of the different ways that the Chinese and European manufacturers develop their cars. What’s there in the Dacia works well, whereas you’re in for a bit more of a fight with the Leapmotor’s apparent luxury features. Dacia Spring vs Leapmotor T03: Interior The interior is a case in point. Inside, the T03 is clearly intended to feel like a ‘proper’ car, with its restrained styling and standard infotainment screen. It’s unmistakably quite a small space, though, so it can’t help but feel slightly incongruous. There’s none of the sense of fun that small cars, including the Spring, are traditionally quite good at. Although the Leapmotor’s touchscreen works passably well, it’s not great. It has no Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, so you’re reliant on the radio and Bluetooth for media and the built-in system for navigation, which is quite fiddly to programme. The climate controls are also on the screen, and although they’re permanently displayed in a bar at the bottom, the ‘buttons’ are quite small. Neither of these cars has automatic climate control, so you end up fiddling with the heater and fan speed a lot. That process is so much easier with the Dacia’s physical knobs and switches. Our test car has the optional touchscreen with phone mirroring, and while the more basic version doesn’t have a centre screen at all, it has an integrated holder for your phone, which does media and navigation pretty well anyway. Neither of the two has heated seats. That’s frustrating because it can’t be very expensive to fit heating elements to the seats. Given these cars are used primarily for short hops, you end up losing quite a lot of range to the heater when you just want your back to be kept warm. With all that said, the T03 is far more accommodating than the Spring. Its doors feel much less tinny, the seats have more padding and the driving position is far superior to the Dacia’s. The Spring makes you feel more like a circus bear in a comedy car. The pedals are too close for comfort and you sit quite high in relation to the controls and the top of the windscreen. Both are small cars, so rear carrying space is inevitably limited. Surprisingly enough, at 6ft2in I can just about sit behind my own driving position in both, albeit slightly easier in the Leapmotor. That’s despite it being a little shorter in length than the Dacia. The T03 partly has its architecture to thank for that, because it doesn’t need to be able to house a petrol engine in the front for other variants, unlike the Spring. At the same time, it also sacrifices some boot space. Its 210-litre boot is notably tighter than the Dacia’s (308 litres) and has a much narrower opening. Dacia Spring vs Leapmotor T03: On the road The Spring makes more of its limited means on the road too. It’s easy to become jaded when it comes to power outputs in electric cars, but when you’re talking double figures, every pony counts. And in this case, the Leapmotor has almost 1.5 times as many of them as the Dacia.  If this were true for the Mercedes-AMG C63 and the BMW M3, the Mercedes would have 768bhp. According to the official figures, however, the Spring is only a second slower to 62mph, and subjectively you would struggle to tell the difference. Neither car is quick, but in both cases they have enough performance to keep up with traffic on A- and B-roads. Sure, you’re to the boards quite a lot, but while that’s tiring in a Kia Picanto screaming its little head off, it makes very little difference in an EV whether you use half or all the power. Where you do feel the lack of go – in both cars – is on the motorway. Make no mistake: these are not quadricycles; they’ll cruise at 70mph if they have to and that makes them all the more versatile. But you can sense they’re not entirely happy doing it. Driving at 60-70mph requires a bit of planning, crosswinds affect them in a way that we’re no longer used to and you feel vulnerable between HGVs or when overtaking the SUVs trundling in the middle lane. You might expect the Leapmotor to have another trump card here in the form of its adaptive cruise control. But it’s so poorly tuned that you might as well not have it. The way it seems to want to be either accelerating or braking, and struggles to maintain a speed, is just not comfortable. Although you can set it to standard cruise control, you have to be stopped and in Park to do so, which is not very practical on a motorway. If you plan to do anything more than occasional motorway driving, neither of these cars is going to provide you with much joy, also because their range and charging speeds feel like a throwback to EVs from seven years ago. Still, both will do more than 100 miles on a charge, in winter, which is a good deal more than most people cover on a daily basis. Again, the Dacia closes the on-paper gap. It may have a 10kWh-smaller battery, but it’s also considerably more efficient. On the same cold day, we achieved 4.2mpkWh from the Spring and just 3.4mpkWh from the T03. The Leapmotor has the longer range, but not by much. City streets are where these two feel most at home. At only about 1.6m wide and with a turning circle of less than 10m (the Dacia has a manual handbrake if you need it to be tighter still, though maybe not in town), you can thread them through narrow gaps without a care in the world. The Dacia is perhaps marginally easier to place because you can see the edges of the bonnet, but if this is how you’ll use them, there’s very little in it.  Bigger differences, of quality and character, surface on a country road. Some might see these as city cars, which they are, I suppose. Equally, they would be eminently useful for nipping into town if you live in a rural village with patchy public transport and no cycling infrastructure. You rarely appreciate a narrow car as much as when you’re dodging an oncoming truck on a narrow country lane. Any sortie in the Leapmotor necessarily starts by turning off about seven different ‘safety’ systems, to save you being driven to distraction by the lane keeping assistance tugging at the steering or the driver monitoring berating you for yawning. It’s impossible to turn them off while driving, too. I find it hard to imagine an engineer or exec driving this car and deciding this is a pleasant enough way to travel. In the Dacia, everything works better in the first place and turning it off is done with a single button. The Leapmotor unequivocally feels like the more mature car on the open road, though. It’s more planted, more stable, and you can be con dent that it will grip, whereas the Dacia feels flighty because of its loose body control, plastic Linglong EcoMaster tyres and rudimentary damping. The Spring’s rear axle seems to have next to no rebound damping and just slams down into the road a er sharp ridges and sleeping policemen. Both cars possess very light, disconnected steering, though the Dacia has a slightly keener front end, which actually makes it more fun if you’re prepared for the abundance of body roll and lack of grip. A quick look online shows that acceptably grippy tyres for the Dacia wouldn’t cost very much. Those might swing the balance the other way, but if you had to give one of these cars to an unenthusiastic driver, you would pick the T03 because it has just that fraction more of a safety margin. It used to be a French national sport to coax a clapped-out Citroën 2CV or Renault 4 up a mountain pass at lightning speed, but let’s be honest: not everyone is into that. To a greater or lesser extent, that is what these two cars feel like: the small cars of yesteryear. They’re quite tinny and not especially luxurious or capable, but they provide basic transport and there is something entertaining about driving them quickly down a country road and catching up all the dawdlers in their much faster cars. And while neither car will top any group tests for safety, you can bet your kneecaps that they’ll protect you better in a crash than a Citroën AX. Dacia Spring vs Leapmotor T03: Verdict Appointing a winner is tricky, because the Spring has gradually whittled away the T03’s on-paper advantage. The Dacia unapologetically feels like a small, cheap car. It does it well and with a sense of fun. The Leapmotor tries to be a more serious, big car and succeeds to a point but it also feels more like an appliance and frustrates with some of the underdeveloped ‘luxury’ features. There’s a place for both, but in the absence of outright competence, a small car is better with a sense of humour and the Dacia Spring is the more likeable product.  Winner: Dacia Spring Cheery and fun. There’s not much to it, but what little there is works well, except for the tyres. Second: Leapmotor T03 More of everything, even if not everything is quite up to snuff. The more competent car, but at the cost of charm. Nearly-new alternatives The step down in capability from a Renault 5 to a Spring is more of a tumble than the step down from a Megane to a 5. The same is true in the Stellantis family: the step down from an electric Astra to a Corsa is far smaller than from a Corsa to a Leapmotor T03. That automatically leads you to wonder: well, what about a Corsa? If you really want a newish electric car on a budget, there are lots of facelifted Vauxhall Corsa Electrics for sale online with delivery mileage for the same money as the Spring or the T03. The Renault Zoe has been out of production for almost a year, so you’ll have to accept a higher mileage, but very fresh ones can be had for even less than the Corsa. Or how about an MG 4? Delivery-mileage standard-range cars can be bought for well under £20,000. Comparing new and used is fraught when you have to take into account older cars and expired warranties, but this is not the case here and becomes more of an existential question.",

    "description": "Given that the motorcycle industry has been on the ropes the last few years, one of the bravest moves a major marque can make right now is release a niche motorcycle. But that’s exactly what BMW Motorrad has just done… and we’re here for it. The brand new BMW R 12 G/S—the latest model built on BMW’s updated neo-retro R12 boxer platform—combines vintage aesthetics with a decent measure of off-road capability. It speaks to customers who sit in the middle of a very unique Venn diagram; those who want a classically styled bike, those who like going off-piste, and those willing to spend a premium for the privilege. This isn’t the first modern classic boxer to bear the G/S moniker.…",

    "description": "Bolt Motor Company specializes in lithe custom creations with sharp lines and crisp finishes. Their ethos likely has to do with the fact that they share a workshop with their sister company—the Spanish Formula 3 racing team, Campos Racing. Of all the marques that pass through Bolt’s doors, we can tell they love tinkering with BMWs the most. Since opening their doors, they’ve peppered us with a steady stream of custom BMWs ranging from mild to wild. This custom BMW R100 sits squarely in the latter camp. The donor bike, a 1982 R100RT, was first wheeled into Bolt Motor Co.’s workshop with very high mileage and looking more than a little worse for wear. Bolt loves nothing more than restoring rough wrecks into fantastic forms of fantasy, so they happily tore into it.…",

    "description": "China’s CFMoto has many new bikes that are catching attention worldwide, but none of them have made as big a splash as the 450MT. This is the motorcycle that the company plans to re-enter India with in mid-2025, and we had a chance to get acquainted with it on a ride around the Outer Ring Road in Hyderabad. One of the many things the 450MT has going right is the way it looks. It has a handsome, large and proportionate design that doesn’t look or feel budget in any way. When it comes to looking like a scaled-down big ADV, the 450MT achieves this better than any of its current rivals. The overall fit, finish and quality of materials feel like they’re from a segment above, and you could remove the badges and easily believe that this was a bike from any top manufacturer. Weighing 195kg fully fuelled, it is 13 kilos heavier than the new 390 Adventure but a kilo lighter than the Himalayan 450. Lifting it off the stand echoes the weight figure on paper – definitely not as light-feeling as the KTM but also not as top-heavy as the Himalayan, which is interesting because this has a similarly sized 17.5-litre fuel tank. Seat height is the lowest in the class at 820mm, and it can be further lowered to 800mm by using a different mounting point on the rear shock linkage. Tall riders will probably want to go for the accessory seat, which raises the seating position by 50mm. There are only two bikes in the country at the moment, and they’re being used for validation purposes by CFMoto’s local partner (who has asked not to be named yet), so we didn’t take the risk of riding the 450 off-road. On-road manners were good, with the bike having a light steering feel and being easy to manage at low speeds. This easy nature translates to the handling as well – it’s quite good, although it very much feels like a tall ADV with a large front wheel. The bike displays a tendency to lean over a little abruptly, but I chalk that down to the CST tyres, which work decently well, but you could improve the bike with better tyres. I’d also like more bite from the brakes, which, like the tyres, are more than adequate but not great. The suspension feels set a little on the firm side, but it is fully adjustable at the front and rebound/preload adjustable at the rear. Attacking a set of tall rumble strip speed breakers suggested that this suspension doesn’t feel quite as plush as the Himalayan, but it is better at taking big hits than the KTM 390 Adventure. The engine is one of the highlights. It’s smooth in a way no single can match, and it makes a deep and involving sound that’s similar to the Aprilia RS 457 but also a little different. CFMoto has gone for very short gearing, so the bike feels remarkably tractable at low speeds but a little high-revving above 120kph. A super-light clutch also aids rideability in the city, although those interested in a lot of high-speed touring may want to make some changes to the final drive sprockets. The 6-speed gearbox is smooth, and an upshift-only quickshifter will be sold as an accessory.   Our test bike had quite poor fuelling, but we were warned that this would be the case as the company was working on engine calibration for our local fuel. The second bike behaved far better, and the company assures us that the fuelling will be fully sorted by the time it launches the 450MT. On that topic, the recommended fuel is 95 octane. In typical CFMoto fashion, the 450MT is loaded with features, including a very nice TFT display, a height-adjustable windscreen, cross-spoked rims that support tubeless tyres, and adjustable suspension. From a touring standpoint, the only thing some people may miss is cruise control. A limited opportunity to shoot photographs means that this will be a quick review, but you can check out our video review for more details. Ultimately, the 450MT looks good, is enjoyable to ride and has built a good reputation overseas for quality and reliability. It will come into India as a CKD, and we’re told a sub-Rs 4 lakh price is the target, which we hope the company can achieve because anything more will be a bit of a challenge. Moreover, CFMoto and its local distributor have a big task on their hands when it comes to providing high-quality sales and after-sales experience. Hopefully, that will be achieved. Because this bike really has a lot going for it. Also see: CFMoto 450MT video review",

Suzuki Burgman to be updated soon Sports a different exhaust, suggesting some engine changes Currently priced between Rs 95,800 and Rs 1.16 lakh Suzuki Burgman to be updated soon; spotted testing The Burgman has largely remained unchanged since its launch in 2018 With this update, it is likely that Burgman’s design will see evolutionary updates, similar to the changes we saw on the 2025 Access compared to the previous model. The brake light on this Burgman test mule appears to be similar to the Avenis, but the spy shots reveal that the display has been carried over from the outgoing model. This update is likely to revise the design of the Burgman with some feature additions, just like Suzuki did with the latest Access.  It is likely that the updated Burgman will feature powertrain and chassis upgrades similar to those of the Access. One clue that the engine will see some revisions is in the different exhaust muffler on the test mule, which is quite similar to the latest Access.  The Suzuki Burgman was launched back in 2018; since then, this maxi-scooter has largely remained unchanged. It recently received an update to comply with the OBD2B norms and a new colour, but its overall design has remained unchanged. It is available in two variants: Street (Rs 95,800) and Street EX (Rs 1.16 lakh), where the latter gets a 12-inch wheel. It’s worth mentioning that before the 2025 Access was launched, spy shots of its test mule had been seen for quite a few months. Since this is the first time a spy shot of the updated Burgman has surfaced, its launch is likely some time away. When this updated Suzuki Burgman does launch, expect a small price bump in price over the current model. All prices ex-showroom, Delhi.

    "description": "The BMW R 12 G/S has been revealed overseas after the brand teased its imminent arrival a few days ago. This is the scrambler version based on the R 12 nineT platform and it shares its engine and main frame with that bike.  BMW R 12 GS has 200mm / 210mm (F/R) of suspension travel It shares its engine, main frame with the R 12 nineT Available with 17-inch or 18-inch rear wheel options BMW R 12 GS engine, weight, styling details R 12 GS rides on a 21/17-inch (F/R) setup with raised suspension The R 12 G/S is a scrambler that is based on the R 12 nineT. In terms of design changes, the R 12 G/S features hand protectors with cockpit fairing as standard.  The R 12 G/S comes with a 21-inch front wheel as standard. For the rear wheel, there are two options, depending on the chosen package: Standard or Enduro Package Pro. The main differences between these two packages are the rear wheel size and seat height. The Enduro Package Pro upgrades the rear wheel from 17-inches to 18-inches and raises the seat height from 860mm to 875mm. With the optional Rallye seat, the seat height can be increased further to 890mm. Additionally, the Enduro Package Pro includes features like off-road footpegs, a 20mm handlebar riser and the Enduro Pro riding mode, which adds to the standard Rain, Road, and Enduro modes. It sports minimal bodywork and sits higher from the ground with a fully adjustable USD fork with 200mm of travel and a monoshock with 210mm of travel. The R 12 G/S has a tank capacity of 15.5 litres and with it fully brimmed, it tips the scales at 229kg. These updates give the scrambler a distinctly purposeful stance, complemented by the Paralever swingarm. Its design is more closely aligned with the earlier HP2 Enduro than the R 1300 GS, and its heritage can be traced back to the iconic R 80 G/S. Braking duties are handled by twin 310mm discs up front with axially mounted Brembo callipers coupled with a 265mm rotor at the rear. It gets a full suite of electronic rider aids from BMW such as traction control, cornering ABS (switchable), engine braking control, keyless ignition and LED headlight with optional adaptive headlight. The 1,170cc, air/oil-cooled, horizontally-opposed (boxer) twin-cylinder engine is carried over from the R 12 nineT that produces 109hp at 7,000rpm and 115Nm at 6,500rpm. It provides the same peak power at identical rpm as the R 12 nineT. It is available in a single variant with three colour options. It remains to be seen when BMW launches the R 12 G/S in India and at what price. Also see: Royal Enfield Classic 650 launched at Rs 3.37 lakh",

    "description": "The Eldorado’s new looks for 1967 were received very well, and generated immediate sales success for Cadillac’s halo coupe. Eldorado had continually struggled to find anything but a niche customer base since its inception in 1953, but it seemed its time had finally arrived. As discussed in our last entry , both 1967 and 1968 were banner years for the Cadillac brand and Eldorado, and the company broke its overall sales record on both occasions.  In 1968 Cadillac sold 230,003 vehicles, and despite a hefty 11 percent price increase 24,528 of those were Fleetwood Eldorados. 1969 brought new styling across the line, and Eldorado strayed away from its sleek origins. But would customers take notice and shop elsewhere? ( Note: The bearded 18th century man glares angrily at the 1969 Eldorado because it is significantly uglier than the previous year.)",
