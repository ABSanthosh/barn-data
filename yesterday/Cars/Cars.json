    "description": "As with the older Tour-X4, Arai’s latest Adventure helmet is very versatile, in that it can also be configured as a road helmet without the peak or an MX-style helmet without the visor. However, it now addresses a universal complaint with the previous Tour-X4 – its visor change mechanism that needed the removal of four screws. The new one debuts a much easier system where the entire peak and visor can be removed by using just a small push tab under the covering plate. In typical Arai fashion, it’s a marvelously over-engineered solution that can be intimidating to use at first, but you quickly figure it out, and the system works well. Just ensure that the mechanism is properly clicked into place before you ride off!   The X5 gets a new Pinlock-compatible visor that has a more rounded profile with improved optics. One of the big changes here is the removal of the trademark eyebrow vents in the visor, which is a bit bittersweet. On the one hand, those vents definitely work well, but the flip side is that they tend to leak in continuous heavy rain, even when closed. The Tour-X5 also drops the chin vents on the sides of the helmet jaw. The total number of vents has reduced, but the actual venting is still superb, so I have no complaints.      I spent a week in this helmet at the GS Trophy, which was easily the most intense riding of my life, and the comfort was excellent. The best helmets are the ones that melt away into the background and let you focus on your riding, and this one manages just that.  The Tour-X5’s peak has also been redesigned, and I found that it had noticeably less lift at high speeds on an adventure bike. It also feels much better on naked bikes, with negligible lift at a steady 100kph. However, the tradeoff is that wind noise is quite high, so it’s best to use this helmet on a bike with good wind protection.    The Tour-X5 has a weight similar to the Tour-X4   Weighing 1,650 grams, it is more or less the same as the T4, but like the old helmet, it feels superbly balanced and great for all-day usage. Another really appreciable change is that Arai knows almost all its customers will install a Bluetooth communicator, so they’ve made it easier to do so. The cheek pads now have dedicated circular Velcro extensions for your speakers, and there are even small wire-managing tabs built into the liner. This is definitely the nicest helmet I’ve used for installing/removing a comms device, and it’ll be great to see other Arai models get a similar treatment.    It has convenient cut-outs for speakers   The helmet is now ECE 22-06-compliant, and quality is at a typically high level with a beautiful paint finish, the most luxurious inner liner material you’ll ever come across and a solid, built-to-last feel in every component. As always, this helmet is an investment in a top-quality handmade product, and the prices match that. They currently start at a little under Rs 60,000 for plain colours in Europe and go up for graphics. You will save a significant amount if you shop from some Asian markets, but be aware that Arai’s shell shapes and sizes are different in these markets, so it’s crucial to try before you buy.    Where: araihelmet.eu   Price: Rs 64,000 (approx.)   Also see: Arai Tour-X4 helmet review",

    "description": "If there’s one thing our otherwise very accommodating photo and video crew insist on, it’s an early morning start. The golden hour of soft light at sunrise guarantees beautiful captures.   But today, it’s me leading the pre-dawn charge to our shoot location an hour outside Mumbai for a less noble, more selfish reason. There’s a Lotus Emira waiting on the other side of the journey, and I’m itching to drive it. Drive it hard. There’s just a few hours before our favourite road is swarmed by two-wheelers, trucks and tractors. The window of opportunity is small.   Lotus Emira engine and chassis What is the Emira, and why is it special? In a line, it’s a small, light and tight sportscar – the kind of car that made Lotus Lotus. Think Elise, Exige and Evora. What makes the Emira doubly special is that it is also the last of its kind from Lotus, with the Chinese-owned Brit carmaker committing to an all-electric future in the years to come. The all-electric Eletre SUV and Emeya grand tourer are the ‘new’ Lotus’ first steps in its transformation from sportscar specialist to EV specialist. No volts, amps or range talk today, though. The Emira is a proper combustion-enginedsportscar with its heart literally in the right place – just ahead of the rear axle. The mid-engined layout dictates the Emira’s gorgeous form, but I’ll have time to ogle at it later. Time is of the essence. The engine in question is Mercedes-AMG’s manic M139 unit, better known as the source of power on the mad AMG A 45 S. The highly strung turbocharged four-cylinder unit makes 360hp and 430Nm in the Lotus (421hp and 500Nm in the A 45 S), and more powerful iterations are said to follow. There’s a supercharged V6, too (see below), but the four-pot unit, at the very least, deserves a fair hearing. Let’s not forget Lotus has a long, back catalogue of four-cylinder greats. The engine is nestled amidst an aluminium chassis, and the Emira tips the scales at 1,446kg, all in. It’s not as featherweight as Lotuses of old, but it’s no heavier than a comparable Porsche Cayman either. Lotus Emira performance The Emira’s doors open conventionally (no scissor or butterfly doors here), and getting in is convenient enough by sportscar standards, thick sill notwithstanding. There’s a Lambo-like flap to access the starter button; press it, and the engine rumbles to life. The sound at idle itself establishes that this is no namby-pamby family sedan engine. Let the show begin. I quickly realise I’ve underestimated the potency of the powerplant. Pressing down hard on the accelerator launches the Emira well into the mid-range, and before I can say “turbo lag”, it is well past 6,000rpm. I back off before it does. Woof! I make a fresh start and learn a few more things about the engine over the next few minutes. One, it’s un-turbo-like in its willingness to rev. I think I saw 7,000rpm on the digital tacho. Two, there’s a delightful urgency with which it pulls in the mid-range. It’s almost as if no one told it it’s a small engine. Three, it sounds great. With the engine just behind the passenger cabin, you can hear it breathe intimately. The soundtrack made up of intake noises, hisses from the blowoff valves, a raspy exhaust note, and pops, bangs and crackles on the overrun is better than anything you’d get on the otherwise superb KEF audio system. Despite thin rubber on 20-inch rims, ride comfort is good. The characterful engine eggs you to drive harder, and you know what? The relatively sensible power figure means you can get more out of the engine than you can in an over-endowed supercar. The 4.42-second 0-100kph time isn’t record-setting but is quick in absolute terms and par for the course for this class of sportscar. Oh, and Merc’s 8-speed dual-clutch gearbox is game for spirited driving and is satisfyingly responsive to tugs at the paddle shifters or gear lever. Lotus Emira ride and handling The experience gets elevated when I get to the twisty section of the road. Lotus sportscars have long been revered for their handling prowess. Now I know why. There’s a brilliant connect at the steering. Hydraulically assisted, it feels well-oiled in its smoothness and has the right weight to perfectly communicate what the front wheels are up to. Turn-in is sharp and smooth without feeling absolutely pointy, which, in its own way, makes this car easy to get up to speed with. Grip levels are reassuringly good throughout, and I’m always left with a feeling that the car could have taken the last corner faster still. There’s room for the driver to level up to the car’s capabilities without being intimidated, and that’s a good thing.   Over familiar corners, the Emira’s mid-engined balance shines through. There’s no delay between command and execution, and I feel at one with the car. It’s not a front-row seat to your favourite artist’s performance. In an Emira, you are the artist. A compliant suspension that’s quick to regain composure after a mid-corner bump, beautifully metred brakes and a gearbox happy to oblige with a high rpm downshift are other elements that keep you so, so engrossed in the drive. For the brave, there’s the option to dial up the engagement further by switching to Track drive mode, which reduces electronic intervention and brings with it some twitchiness at the rear end. On the subject, the Emira doesn’t get adjustable dampers. Buyers have to pick between the Tour and Sport packages (different dampers, spring rates and tyres) at the time of speccing their car. Only larger speedbreakers will require a zig-zag manoeuvre to clear. Other takeaways from my drive? Frontal visibility is great, and ride comfort is actually pleasant. I’m not cocooned from road imperfections, but the Emira is also not jarringly stiff as many other sportscars are. The 20-inch low-profile tyres tend to tramline, though, which is something to be careful of on wavy surfaces. There’s no nose-lift function, but a slow crawl is enough for the Emira to clear speedbreakers without making chin or belly contact. However, the Emira has an unusually large turning circle, and as I learn, the gearbox doesn’t like being rushed between drive and reverse. Also, the Emira doesn’t particularly like crawling speeds – it’ll lurch when you want it to inch forward. Lotus Emira interior and exterior It’s when the photo and video crew shoot static shots that I get to really take in the Emira’s design. What a looker! It’s some parts aggressive, some parts delicate, and all parts gorgeous. There’s a fantastic flow to the design, and even the aero scoops and channels don’t look forced or overdone. It’s a thing of beauty in the classic sense. My favourite bit is the rear end, which is home to a high deck spoiler and purposeful dual exhausts that poke out of a mesh surround. “Ferrari hai kya?” Emira draws attention everywhere. It’s rather nice on the inside, too. It’s a fuss-free – simple even – environment that gives the driver easy access to all information and controls. The 12.3-inch digital dials are easy to read; the 10.25-inch touchscreen packs in Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and there are physical controls (hurray!) for the climate control and drive mode functions. All touch points are really well finished, and our test car even had an Alcantara finish on the roof. Also, while the cockpit is cosy, there’s enough space for two large adults to sit in comfort. There’s a degree of practicality built into the cabin with cupholders, door pockets, a storage box between the seats, a usable open space under the centre console and storage behind the front seats (it’s a strict two-seater) for a soft bag or two. The engine cover also lifts to reveal a 151-litre cavity that can accommodate two cabin bags. It may not look it, but there’s enough room for two large adults.   Lotus Emira price estimate, verdict It’s easy to fall for the Lotus Emira. It’s stunning to look at, deeply rewarding to drive and even reasonably India-friendly thanks to a comfy-enough ride. Before you start mentally speccing your Emira (might I recommend the fetching Hethel yellow), there is a spoiler. And that is the price. Lotus is expected to launch the Emira at Rs 3.1 crore (estimated, ex-showroom) before options. To put things in perspective, the sensational Porsche Cayman GTS 4.0 was on offer for Rs 1.6 crore not too long ago. Then again, the Cayman is no longer on sale, and there’s actually no other mid-enginedsportscar available in India for Emira money. The Ferraris, Lamborghinis and McLarens of the world sit way higher up the power and price ladder. The luggage bay aft the engine can hold two cabin bags. The Emira doesn’t have price to power on its side, but driving purists with deep pockets might see the Lotus in the right light. And that is as a loud, proud and emotive sportscar. The kind of car that we grew up lusting for.And one that’s guaranteed to light up your drives for years and maybe decades to come. If you’re on the fence about adding one to your driveway, just remember they won’t make ’em like this in the not-too-distant future. The clock is ticking. Lotus Emira V6 engine If AMG’s turbocharged four-cylinder doesn’t cut it for you, the Emira can also be had with a 3.5-litre supercharged V6. The Toyota-sourced unit makes more power (400hp and 430Nm) and betters the AMG-powered Emira with a 4.3 second 0-100kph time. However, the bigger differences will be in the way the power is delivered and theatrics. Gearbox options include a 6-speed auto and a, wait for it, 6-speed manual, complete with an exposed gearchange mechanism! The other thing? The price difference to the turbo is expected to be all of Rs 10 lakh or so. Something tells me the supercharged V6 will be the engine of choice in India. Manual gearbox an option on the V6.

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-ax5-review-in-demand-433488#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Car+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options – an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox – priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) – to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. What’s missing is a variant badge on the boot.  Mahindra XUV 3XO AX5 interiors The interior retains the dual-tone colour scheme with the top half of the dashboard and door pads being black, and the lower half finished in white. While the dual colours elevate the cabin’s appeal and sense of space, its white areas get soiled very easily and warrant utmost care to keep clean. It doesn’t get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you won’t be left with a sweaty back on a hot day. The seats, however, are small, and occupants with large body frames will find these too snug for comfort. Also, the driver footwell is cramped, just like the other variants. The rear seat is a spacious and comfortable place, even for three adults. A space saver spare tyre beneath its floor has enabled Mahindra to liberate a bit more luggage space (compared to the XUV300), but the 3XO’s 295-litre boot is still small by segment standards, and its loading lip is high. Also read: Mahindra XUV 3XO gets five star BNCAP crash test rating Mahindra XUV 3XO AX5 equipment This variant gets a small, single-pane sunroof. As far as equipment goes, the AX5 variant gets twin 10.2-inch screens – one for the instrument cluster and one for the touchscreen – with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. It also gets a sunroof (single pane), a wireless charger, dual-zone climate control, auto LED headlamps, power-folding mirrors, rear air-con vents, a reversing camera, hill-start assist, 6 airbags and ESP, to name a few. Mahindra XUV 3XO AX5 performance Carried over from the outgoing XUV300 is the 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine that now makes 111hp and 200Nm. The good news is that despite being a three-cylinder unit, it is very smooth and refined. Compared to the TGDi direct-injection turbo-petrol unit (available in higher variants), this unit makes 20hp and 30Nm less, but we’re happy to report that in the real-world, this deficit hardly comes to light. .  It is quicker than its predecessor in both outright and rolling acceleration. It isn’t devoid of turbo lag, but once it is on boost – beyond 2,000rpm – it accelerates with a sense of urgency. Performance feels strongest and most effortless, in the 2,000-4,500rpm band. At 1,362kg, the XUV 3XO is heavy, but it still accelerates to 100kph from a standstill in a respectable 11.58 seconds. Interestingly, the 3XO’s outright as well as rolling acceleration times from 20-80kph in third gear and 40-100kph in fourth gear are much quicker than its predecessor.

To keep a check on fuel consumption while idling, it gets an automatic engine stop-start function, too.   The XUV 3XO’s clutch is light but has a long travel. Also, while its 6-speed gearbox is smooth, its throws are too long and it doesn’t feel as slick as some of its Japanese or Korean rivals. Its steering feels effortless, and even though it gets adjustable steering modes that alter its weight and resistance, it doesn’t make it sportier or sharper.   Ride quality feels even better than the top-spec due to the AX5's higher profile tyres. Its ride and handling balance is spot on, but what further enhance the ride comfort are its high profile tyres (with 16-inch alloys). These absorb road shocks better than its higher variants that come equipped with 17-inch alloys. Mahindra XUV 3XO AX5 price and verdict Performance is so good, it makes you question the need to spend more for the TGDi version. The entry-level MPFI turbo-petrol’s performance and refinement are so good, it makes you question the need to spend more for the more powerful and advanced TGDi turbo-petrol engine. Sure, the latter is available in higher variants only and packs some premium features but despite being limited up to the mid AX5 variant, the MPFi engine gets more than just the mere basics. And for Rs 11 lakh, this AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol and manual transmission spells excellent value for money, which explains why it is in such high demand.

    "description": "With its casual bobber styling and easygoing twin-cylinder motor, the Royal Enfield Shotgun 650 isn’t the type of motorcycle you’d expect the unhinged crew at ICON Motosports to froth over. Nevertheless, Portland’s finest were nonplussed when Royal Enfield asked them to customize one for the annual EICMA trade show. ICON specializes in the outrageous—and nothing is quite as outrageous as turning a mild-mannered cruiser into a bonkers café racer-cum-drag bike. But getting the Shotgun from there to here necessitated a substantial overhaul of its chassis. Most of the frame’s rear half was binned, along with the bike’s wheels, suspension, and swingarm. With a new subframe welded into place, team ICON started piecing together the Shotgun’s new running gear. Some judicious finagling of the front end made room for a set of nitrogen forks from a 2015 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10R.…",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/business/can-european-car-makers-counter-china-%E2%80%9Cworking-smarter%E2%80%9D",
    "description": "Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares says that although Chinese enjoy cost advantages, “they work harder and faster” Penny for the thoughts of Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares when the bombshell news broke of the Volkswagen Group’s decision to close factories in Germany for the first time.  The seismic VW restructure is the result of slowing demand for electric vehicles, coupled with a spiralling cost base. In its development of electric vehicles, VW has chosen to create dedicated architectures and models, selling them alongside existing combustion-engine model lines, something that requires development and investment in two parallel technologies.  Stellantis has taken the opposite approach of ‘multi-energy’ architectures that can house multiple powertrain options, with the advantage of being able to scale according to demand.  Just weeks earlier at the Paris motor show, Tavares had said the VW approach “is going to put you on your knees”.  While not referencing VW directly, he said: “Piling up the new world on top of the old world is not the same thing as transforming from the old world to the new world.  “Even if many people think that you make tons of money in the automotive industry, it does not have the capability to pile up the two worlds. The diversity and complexity that generates is unmanageable, unmeasurable. “We are just growing the size of the monster. You are keeping more technologies, more platforms for longer. You are going to pump your blood, your resources. At one point in time you are going to get stuck.”  With this in mind, the industry’s next trend is perhaps even more alarming for the strain it will put on resources: two identically styled models carrying the same badge but built on two different architectures.  We’ve seen it with the new Mini Cooper (ICE models from Oxford, EVs from China) and both VW and Mercedes-Benz have confirmed this approach for their future model lines too. An unwillingness to compromise on products is admirable, but at what cost?  Car makers are community citizens too, and in the case of VW this bloated approach will lead to job cuts and factory closures, and pay cuts for the staff left behind.  Behind this, Europe’s lack of cost competitiveness with China on all fronts links so many of the industry’s struggles here. The Chinese enjoy cost advantages on components but “they work harder and faster”, said Tavares. Europe can counter by “working smarter” and ditching bureaucracy that “the customer does not care about and uses a lot of resources\". He added: \"We are overregulated in the West. The same number of hours with less bureaucracy is the same thing as working more. How many hours do we spend doing things that don’t create value for the final cost in the West? A lot.”",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/finally-first-pictures-2026-electric-jaguar-super-gt-revealed",
    "description": "Prototype for Jaguar's £100k Taycan rival gives a long-awaited first look at the firm's new design language The first car of Jaguar’s new era has finally broken cover as it begins road testing for a 2026 launch, just two weeks before the firm unveils a concept that will set the tone for the design of all its upcoming models. The first all-new Jaguar since the I-Pace was launched in early 2018, this striking four-door GT is the first of three upcoming electric cars due to arrive by the end of the decade atop a new brand-specific, EV-only platform dubbed JEA. The other two EVs are a large luxury saloon and an SUV. Technical details remain closely guarded, save for what the company has already confirmed: it will pack north of 575bhp, have a range of more than 430 miles and be priced above £100,000. But now that road testing is finally under way, fresh images give the first indication of the size, shape and silhouette of Jaguar’s Porsche Taycan rival. They reveal just how accurate Autocar’s earlier renderings (see below) were in their straight-edged proportions, long bonnet and complete departure from recognisable Jaguar styling hallmarks - features that will carry over to all the brand’s future models. Beneath the heavy camouflage of this early prototype, it is clear that the Jaguar GT will be a large, low-slung saloon with a rakish, coupé-like roofline, a generous wheelbase and its A-pillars positioned as far as possible behind the front axle to give a cab-rear silhouette reminiscent of some of Jaguar’s biggest-engined past models. Interestingly, in size and shape, it appears not dissimilar to the electric Jaguar XJ that was axed midway through its development programme in 2021, though it will bear no relation to that car. The front ends of Jaguar’s new models will be dominated by a distinctive new lighting arrangement made up of ultra-slim LED strips that will be almost invisible when off, but they are covered entirely on this test car. The one design element recognisable from past Jaguar models on this car is the front grille panel, which is the same shape as that of the I-Pace, but camouflage is clearly visible underneath, which strongly suggests that it is non-functional and won’t feature on the production car. Instead, electric Jaguars will wear an all-new face centred around a new decorative ‘grille’ and a new interpretation of the Jaguar badge. The company has not released any pictures of the rear end, but Autocar has previously reported that one of the most shocking design elements of Jaguar’s new-era models will be the absence of a rear windscreen. Instead, there will be a digital rear-view mirror, à la Polestar 4. It is unlikely we will see the interior before the official unveiling next year, but sources suggest Jaguar’s future cabins will be highly minimalist and tech-heavy affairs, largely omitting buttons in favour of touch controls and dominated by a wraparound infotainment interface that spans the width of the dashboard, with a secondary touchscreen in the centre console for climate control and audio functions.  A greater focus will be placed on rear passenger refinement, with screens on the backs of the front seats, USB-C charging ports and blinds for the back windows. There will also be the option to spec future Jaguar models with two separate rear seats in place of a conventional bench. Clearer indications of what to expect from Jaguar's new-look line-up will be given on 2 December, when CEO Adrian Mardell pulls the wraps off a long-awaited show car at Miami Art Week, dubbed Design Vision Concept, as the first step in a ground-up overhaul of the Jaguar brand that's been in train since JLR's Reimagine strategy was detailed in 2021. In recent weeks, the brand has wound down production of all models except the F-Pace SUV, and even that car has now been pulled from sale in the UK, though it will remain available in other markets for just over a year. Until the production version of the GT arrives in just under two years, Jaguar will have no new cars in showrooms in the UK. During that time, the brand will ramp up its focus on its aftersales and servicing operations, while expanding the electric GT's testing programme worldwide - no doubt providing plenty of opportunities to uncover more details of its design.",

    "description": "Jaguar’s transformation into an all-electric brand has moved closer, as the company has started testing the prototypes of its all-new electric car on public roads this week. Jaguar says the car has already completed ‘tens of thousands of miles of virtual and physical testing’, and the tests on Britain’s public roads will soon be followed by testing on public roads and test sites around the world. While the car seen on Britain’s roads is a disguised prototype of the actual production model, on 2 December, during the Miami Art Week, JLR will present a concept that will serve as a vision of what the new car and company would be like. Jaguar new electric prototype styling details   While the new Jaguar’s styling details are well camouflaged, what’s clear from the pictures are the car’s proportions. Jaguar says it will be a 4-door GT. The prototype clearly shows an elongated bonnet with a rear-set cabin and a swooping coupe-like roofline with a small, flat-deck boot lid. Also evident from the shots are a very upright nose, a long overall length and large tyres. Interestingly, there appears to be a large, tacked-on rectangular grille-like piece upfront. With this being an EV, it’s likely to have been done intentionally to clue us in on a styling detail rather than being there for cooling purposes. Our sister publication, Autocar UK, reports that the car will have “a distinctive new grille motif envisioned as the new face of the Jaguar brand”. Jaguar new electric prototype technical details  The car will be built on a new dedicated electric architecture called JEA (Jaguar Electric Architecture) and will be produced in Solihull in the UK. While further technical details are yet to be confirmed, what’s interesting to see is the upright nose, long bonnet and massive tyres – traits not typical of today’s ‘slipstreamed’ EVs designed to maximise aero efficiency in the pursuit of driving range. However, Autocar UK reports that the production car will have a range of over 700 km and put out around 580hp. The prices in the UK are expected to start at £100,000 (Rs 1 crore approximately). For now, there’s no word on Jaguar’s India plans. However, given the brand’s Indian (Tata Motors) ownership and its operations in India, the electric 4-door GT will likely be headed here after its expected unveiling late next year.  Also See: New Audi Q7 facelift launch on November 28, bookings open Mercedes AMG C 63 S E Performance launched at Rs 1.95 crore",

Engine sizes range from 50cc-450cc Includes Enduro, Motocross and Kids bikes KTM dirt bike range details Three of the six new KTM dirt bikes launched in India are aimed at very young riders. These are the KTM 50 SX, KTM 65 SX and KTM 85 SX. All three of these use two-stroke engines, with the 50cc displacing 5.4hp in a bike that weighs just 41kg. Meanwhile, the KTM 85 SX produces 16hp and has a kerb weight of 81kg. The above bikes are targeted at children getting into the world of off-road riding, but KTM also has options available for adults looking at powerful, full-sized motocross bikes. The first of these is the KTM 250 SX-F which gets a powerful 249.9cc four stroke motor that produces 46.8hp at 13,900rpm and 26.5Nm at 9,500rpm. The 250 SX-F weighs in at 104kg.

    "description": "2011 RUF RT Roadster Location: Miami, Florida Original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: - Mileage: 6,900 miles Price: Call for Price   The Car | 1 of 1 RUF RT Roadster With a reputation for creating the pinnacle of bespoke performance sports cars, RUF can sometimes afford the luxury of creating one-off coach-built vehicles for close family friends and special clientele. The one-of-one RUF RT Roadster was the result of a unique idea presented by such a client to produce a true B-pillar Targa that hadn’t been available from Porsche from the 993 until the 991. This meant engineering a new body based on a 2011 997.2 chassis to create a Targa that would seamlessly combine nostalgia with the exhilarating driving feel RUF is so well known for. The team wanted to pay homage to the very first Targas produced which were famous for their ability to fully remove the rear window to provide a ‘soft window’ Targa experience. The RT Roadster reimagines the iconic rear quarter panel openings that feed the intercoolers, breathing cold air into the twin-turbo 3.8-liter flat-six that produces 650 horsepower delivered to all four wheels through a PDK transmission. Underneath rests a special RUF-tuned suspension and carbon ceramic brakes on all four corners. Finished in a truly bespoke Chromaflair satin paint, the lines of this RT Roadster flow as the paint transitions through its various layers of flake and its undertones are exposed. The interior is finished in contrasting red leather with silver stitching, extended carbon fiber accents, and painted Chromaflair satin interior trim, showcasing RUF's meticulous attention to detail. Factory options include phone connectivity, foldable carbon bucket seats, color-matching hard top panels, matching red leather luggage belts on the rear parcel shelf, and center lock wheels. The RT Roadster was unveiled at Rennsport VI in 2018 and subsequently featured in a MotorTrend article. It has been privately enjoyed by its original owner since then before being offered for sale to the general public. Continue...",

Believed to be the first nut-and-bolt restoration project ever undertaken by Lamborghini, years before the creation of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015, this Countach LP5000 QV represents a unique chapter in Lamborghini history. This 1986 Countach Quattrovalvole, finished in Rosso over Champagne with a Brown dashboard, was originally delivered on April 17, 1986, to a dealership called Autolynn in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. It was equipped with fuel injection to comply with North American emissions regulations and featured USA-specific bumpers. In the summer of 1988, the car was owned by a real estate agent who, after an afternoon drive, parked it in his driveway. Later that day, smoke began to emanate from the engine bay, ultimately igniting a fire that damaged the engine, body panels, and interior, scorching the seats and causing significant smoke damage. Deemed a write-off by the insurance company due to the scarcity and cost of replacement parts, the car seemed destined for obscurity—until the current custodian, a Canadian collector with a deep passion for the Countach, entered the picture. The search for parts was arduous. “I called every Lamborghini dealer in North America, faxed lists, and made countless calls, only to be told that parts were unavailable or would take months to arrive,” the owner recounted. “The factory had shifted focus to the new Diablo, making Countach components nearly impossible to find.” Then, an unexpected call came from a Toronto lawyer representing Lamborghini. The company, aware of his search through multiple inquiries across North America, wanted to inspect the salvaged parts. By 1989, he shipped the car to Milan. Lamborghini’s sales manager, Ubaldo Sgarzi, responded within a week of the car's arrival, confirming receipt and outlining plans to prepare an estimate for the restoration. With the production line for the Countach already dismantled, many parts had to be handmade or specially ordered from original suppliers. The extensive project took two and a half years and cost over USD $240,000— $30,000 more than the price of a new Diablo at the time. “The documentation is immense,” says the owner. Invoices, receipts, and correspondence attest to what was essentially a full rebuild. This restoration stands as a landmark: the first comprehensive restoration carried out by Lamborghini itself, years before the establishment of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015.   Continue...",
