    "description": "Audi is no stranger to odd naming decisions. It replaced its engine displacement badge with an arbitrary ‘performance’ number; ‘e-tron’ (aside from its meaning in French) was first a model, then a suffix, and now a sub-brand; and did you know its CNG cars are badged g-tron? Most recently, in 2023, the brand made the bold decision to assign odd numbers to all its ICE model names and even numbers to all EVs, turning decades of legacy on its head. It was so confusing to customers that the brand reneged in 2025 and is back to numbering cars based on their size. But even before this double U-turn, one model never quite sat right on the scale, and that’s the Q8. 8 is the largest number in the Audi model range, but the Q8 is not the largest SUV. It also implies a relation to the A8, but the Q8 offers nowhere near that kind of chauffeur-driven experience. Most confoundingly, it shares its name with the Q8 e-tron, an EV that’s noticeably smaller. Some argue that it earns its 8 because it’s a sporty, stylish coupé-SUV positioned above the Q7 – but then, its name would include ‘Sportback’, which it doesn’t. Looks menacing and sleek without going over the top. Having spent some time with our long-term Q8, I’ve realised it is best not to think about any of that too much because it detracts from the fact that this is an honest-to-goodness great luxury SUV. For one – and going back to that ‘Sportback’ point – though it looks a little sleeker than most big 5-seat SUVs, it sacrifices no space or practicality to the design. You’d have seen Santa Sergius load it up with Christmas gifts (Autocar India, January 2025), and I, too, managed a couple of airport runs in my time with the Q8. The boot can hold a lot more than its 605-litre rating or the dipping roofline would have you believe, and the rear seat is wide and spacious. I once carried a full complement of passengers, and they actually marvelled at how they weren’t making contact with one another. 605-litre boot is more spacious than it looks on the outside. The Q8 is part of the outgoing generation of big Audis, and with it will go a distinct interior layout that was started with the current Q7 a decade ago. It’s not without its flaws, like the dashboard and centre console made entirely of gloss-black plastic and screens, which attract a layer of dust every time I open the windows even for a short while. But back then, it successfully modernised the Audi interior while keeping it classy and expensive-looking, and that holds true even today, more so now that we’ve seen what’s coming next. It’s a similar story with the digital dials that, though simple, are incredibly clear and easy to read on the move. Among the last Audis to use this cabin layout. Not without flaws, but oh so classy. It’s a big car, for better or worse. I absolutely love lording over traffic on the way to work every day, but navigating the tiny streets in my neighbourhood and parking in my small driveway is tedious, to say the least. At my typical crawling speeds, it’s not surprising that a 2.1-tonne SUV with a turbo-petrol V6 isn’t going to be efficient, but 5.4kpl is low by any measure. And while Sergius enjoyed the ride quality on his highway drive to Goa, in town, the suspension feels firm (and the steering heavy); air suspension is a feature they should not have deleted. Struggled to reach even 6kpl on the daily commute. Then there’s Sakhir Gold: a colour that doesn’t even slightly resemble gold but is no less alluring for it (another confusing Audi naming choice, I suppose). I love the paint shade and am glad they offer it amidst the greys, blacks and silvers typical of German luxury cars. You can even get it on the Q7 now, and it never fails to rouse a remark from anyone who steps into the SUV. In fact, in my experience, whoever does experience the Q8 has only good things to say about it. It’s only those of us who’ve been trying to wrap our heads around its positioning who never quite got it. With the facelift and price revision, it’s now better placed against the likes of the BMW X5 and Mercedes GLE, and in my opinion, it looks better than either of them. By the time you read this, it will have left the fleet and been replaced by a Q7, and for many in the team, that will be an upgrade. For one, it’s got even more space and, crucially, smaller wheels and air suspension, which should allow it to ride better. But its colour? Samurai Grey. Boo!

    "description": "Ride-hailing firm Waymo will work with manufacturer Magna to convert the EVs at a new US factory More than 2000 Jaguar I-Pace electric cars are set to be converted into autonomous taxis at a new factory in the US. The EVs will be converted in Arizona by manufacturer Magna as part of a push by Alphabet-owned autonomous vehicle firm Waymo to expand its services. Already completing more than 250,000 autonomous taxi trips each week in Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix and San Francisco, Waymo now wants to expand to Atlanta, Miami and Washington DC from next year. Its fleet currently consists of 1500 vehicles, which are all I-Paces. Conversion of a further 2000 I-Paces (a “final delivery” to Waymo before Jaguar pulled the model from sale last year ahead of its 2026 rebranding) includes retrofitting an array of hardware, such as roof-mounted lidar, a host radar sensors and 29 cameras, and integrating its own computing software: the sixth-generation Waymo Driver. “The Waymo Driver integration plant in Mesa is the epicenter of our future growth plans,” said Ryan McNamara, Waymo's vice-president of operations. “With our partners at Magna, we’ve opened a manufacturing site that enables the cost efficiency, flexibility and capacity to scale our fleet to new heights.” As the I-Pace no longer made by Jaguar, the site will also begin to convert new cars, such as the Zeekr Mix. At full capacity, the factory will be capable of converting tens of thousands of vehicles per year, claimed Waymo.",

    "title": "What are e-fuels and how can they reduce car emissions?",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/e-fuels",
    "description": "Porsche is one of the leading car brands when it comes to exploring e-fuels 'Carbon-neutral' synthetic fuels could complement electrification – but they face significant challenges The impending ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars has raised questions about whether alternative fuel solutions also have a role to play in reducing transport emissions alongside electrification. Some car manufacturers and governments are working to produce alternative means of fueling a car. This includes hydrogen-powered vehicles, but other firms are pushing two main forms of fuel: e-fuels and biofuels, both types of synthetic fuel.  So what exactly are e-fuels and biofuels, how are they made and could they enter mainstream production? We've collated all we know about these alternative fuels and put together a comprehensive guide about this technology, so read on for more.  What are e-fuels? The name ‘e-fuel’ is short for ‘electrofuel’. E-fuels are a type of synthetic fuel that can be used in internal combustion engines in the same way as normal petrol or diesel.  They're produced using ‘green’ hydrogen and carbon, often sourced from waste biomass or CO2 captured from the atmosphere.  How are e-fuels produced? E-fuels are made by separating hydrogen and oxygen from water using electricity. The next step in the process involves capturing CO2 from the air and then combining that with hydrogen using chemical synthesis.  E-fuels are carbon-neutral, because they use the same amount of CO2 emissions as they emit. For this reason, they’re considered by some car brands, such as Porsche, as a potential alternative to electric cars. An e-fuel’s removal of atmospheric CO2, either through photosynthesis when growing the biomass or by carbon capture, is argued to offset the emissions produced when the fuel is burnt in an engine.  Are e-fuels clean? Whether e-fuels are as environmentally friendly as they seem continues to divide opinion.  Despite arguably being cleaner to produce, e-fuels still emit gases that are harmful to the environment, similar to petrol and diesel. According to the non-profit organisation Transport \u0026 Environment (T\u0026E), recent testing of e-fuels has shown that synthetic fuel emits a similar volume of NOx gases as a car running on regular E10 petrol while also producing far more ammonia and CO. There's also the argument that e-fuels aren't all that efficient in use. According to Enerdata, vehicles using e-fuels have an energy efficiency measuring 4-5 times lower than battery electric cars.  Pros of e-fuels There are a few positives to e-fuels. Some argue that e-fuels are a cleaner source of energy compared with petrol and diesel, due to the methods that can be used to produce them. Electricity required to produce e-fuels can be generated using solar and wind power. E-fuels are capable of powering modern cars without the need for modifications. They can also be used in heavy goods vehicles and vans. While other fuels like hydrogen and electricity require new infrastructure, e-fuels can be used with existing fuel lorries, refineries and pipelines, and filling stations can remain the same.  Need to fill up a car using e-fuels? You’re in luck: it takes just a few minutes, like filling up with petrol or diesel.  Cons of e-fuels The key problem with e-fuels is that they’re costly to produce and can’t yet be produced in large quantities.  They're also incredibly energy-intensive to produce. In the case of e-fuels, there is a huge energy requirement to overcome to produce the necessary hydrogen.  T\u0026E suggests the EU would be required to produce one and a half times its current energy production to generate enough electricity to power its entire road fleet using e-fuels.  In addition, research from the International Council on Clean Transport (ICCT) suggests that around 48% of renewable electricity will be lost during the process of converting e-fuels into liquid.  For comparison, it was found that when using renewable electricity, a battery electric car could travel up to six times farther than a car using e-fuel.  Despite being cleaner to produce, e-fuels also still emit gases that are harmful to the environment, similar to petrol and diesel.  As with fossil fuels, burning them produces poisonous NOx gases and CO, which pose a health risk for local communities. Which manufacturers are investing in e-fuels? Porsche is the front-running car maker in e-fuel development. It invested £62 million into pilot production of synthetic fuels in Chile late in 2022, with a target of roughly 28,500 gallons (130,000 litres) annually. “The potential of e-fuels is huge,” said Porsche research and development executive Michael Steiner. “There are currently more than 1.3 billion vehicles with combustion engines worldwide. Many of these will be on the roads for decades to come, and e-fuels offer the owners of existing cars a nearly carbon-neutral alternative.” Despite Porsche heavily investing in battery electric vehicles, CEO Oliver Blume has said synthetic fuels could extend the life of the purely combustion-engined 911 until the end of the decade. Several other car makers, particularly those with low-volume production outputs, are also keen on using e-fuels to retain combustion engines beyond the end of the decade. Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna has suggested that “ICE still has a lot to do” and Ineos Automotive CEO Lynn Calder was categoric in predicting “that the combustion engine will continue”.   Mazda has also expressed interest, with the brand’s deputy general manager of R\u0026D Christian Schultze saying describing e-fuels as \"an important addition to electrification, as they are easy to implement and they can give an immense effect to the decarbonisation simply by the high number of cars used.” Renault-owned sports car maker Alpine is also keen on e-fuels. However, other car makers, such as Bentley and Volvo, are opposed.  What does the future look like for e-fuels? The UK government has yet to factor e-fuels into its emissions-reduction strategy officially. A report by the Transport Select Committee recently accused the government of “putting all its eggs in one basket” by effectively mandating a widespread transition to battery electric vehicles from 2035.  The report cited shortcomings in EV charging infrastructure and a shortage of raw materials, which may slow or prevent a smooth transition to EVs. “As the cliff edge of 2030 (2035, 2040 and 2050) approaches and minds are concentrated, reality will bite,” it said. The committee urged a “reality check” on the government’s transport strategy and said: “Addressing the existing [petrol and diesel] fleet will be decisive in achieving the UK’s climate goals.\" According to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency, producing all of today’s industrial hydrogen output from electricity would create an electricity demand of 3600TWh.  This is almost 1000TWh more than the EU’s entire energy production last year, of which just 39.4% came from renewables. And that just to match today’s hydrogen output, not the surplus needed for the mass industrialisation of e-fuels; using electricity that could less wastefully power battery electric cars. Yoann Gimbert, e-mobility analyst for environmental lobby group Transport \u0026 Environment, said in October 2022 that using e-fuels in cars and commercial vehicles risks “[sucking] up renewable electricity needed for the rest of the economy”. Gimbert added that e-fuels should be diverted to planes and ships, which can't yet use batteries to decarbonise.  Nonetheless, momentum continues to build globally. Porsche’s e-fuel partner, Highly Innovative Fuels, is now producing e-fuels at its Haru Oni plant in Chile and recently gave the go-ahead for a second plant in Texas, US.  Steve Sapsford, an independent consultant and advisor to sustainable fuel specialist Coryton, told Autocar: “The trick is using the resources for the best overall outcome. On the renewable electricity question, the key argument is that you should be making e-fuels where you have an abundance/excess of renewable energy.  “This is why the Haru Oni plant is in Chile. There is an excess of solar and wind, more than their domestic consumption, but it is difficult to export that energy as electricity to energy-hungry countries, [such as in] Europe.  “It then becomes much more attractive to use that energy to make an extremely energy-dense liquid hydrocarbon, which is easy to ship around the world.”  David Richardson, Coryton’s business development director, believes a total shift is required: “Behind the scenes, there are a lot of very worried people that are saying there’s no way that we can do this [achieve climate targets by switching solely to EVs].  “I’d rather everyone was honest and reset ourselves. Get out and ask what is now the right thing to do, instead of the short-termist – the soundbite type stuff.”",

    "description": "Last month, the 63rd edition of Salone del Mobile, colloquially known as Milan Design Week, filled the Fiera Milano Rho exhibition center with works from the world’s best design houses. Names like Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Prada, Dior, and Hermès were among those represented, as the event showcased everything from furniture to classic, contemporary, and conceptual product design. One particularly curious installation featured a Royal Enfield Flying Flea electric bike, transformed into a bona fide two-wheeled sculpture by Los Angeles–based multidisciplinary artist Mattia Biagi. The custom scene constantly flirts with the concept of motorcycles as works of art. But this project took a no-holds-barred approach to that idea, with Mattia treating the pint-sized Flying Flea FF.C6 as a literal canvas.
