    "description": "Few products have had as tumultuous a journey from concept to reality as the Simple One. Shown first in 2021 with a promise to go on sale in 2022, it eventually went on sale in mid-2023. Fast forward to 2025, and after 1,817 units sold (as per VAHAN data), Simple Energy has updated the One. Simple One updates for 2025 The main update is that it now has a claimed 248km IDC range, up from the original 212km. It has the same 5kWh battery capacity as before, and the company says this increase has been achieved via some electronic trickery and a more efficient drivetrain.  There was no way to test those numbers in our limited time with it, but what I can tell you is that in 45km of mixed riding in all four modes (Eco, Ride, Dash and Sonic), the battery dropped from full to 76 percent SOC. Simple One design, performance This was my first time seeing a Simple One in the flesh, and I thought it was a smashing-looking thing, even if its sharp and angular design is somewhat similar to the Ather 450’s. Quality, too, is at a pleasantly high level, and there are no flimsy plastics or uneven panel gaps. At 30 litres, the One doesn’t have the biggest boot in the segment, but its shape allows you to fit an ECE-certified full-face helmet inside comfortably.   And once you swing your leg over it, you’ll discover the One has the go to match the show. With 8.5kW and 72Nm of torque on tap, acceleration in any mode is peppy, and even in the lowest mode, it can climb flyovers without slowing down. Achieving and maintaining the claimed 105kph top speed is effortless in Dash and Sonic. However, acceleration from a standstill doesn’t feel as spirited as in the Warp mode on an Ather 450. Simple One areas of improvement The problem is that in both of the top two modes, the scooter surges forward for a second or two even once the accelerator is closed, which can put you in trouble, considering the strong performance. We reported this issue when we first rode the prototype in 2022, and it’s disappointing that it hasn’t been resolved. Simple says it is aware of it and is working on a solution, but I think this should have been ironed out before customer deliveries began.   While the scooter’s sporty design language may lead you to believe that it will be stiffly sprung, the suspension setup is rather plush, and the One is one of the more comfortable electric scooters I’ve experienced. However, at 136kg, its weight isn’t something that you can shake off, and what only compounds matters further is the tall (for a scooter) 796mm seat height.  Simple One price, verdict Currently, Simple Energy has only 10 showrooms operational. The company says it plans to scale up to 150 showrooms by March 2026 and bring in a generation two product (the one we rode was termed ‘version 1.5’) to bolster its portfolio. Ultimately, all of that is in the future, and Simple still has much to prove. Until Simple Energy scales up its dealer network and builds a good after-sales reputation, the Rs 1.66 lakh One and its more affordable sibling, the Rs 1.45 lakh Dot One, will remain niche offerings.    All prices ex-showroom, Bengaluru Also See: Simple Energy One prototype review: A simple answer?",

    "description": "It’s akin to landing a dream job you lied through your teeth to get. You walk in on day one, staring down a pile of responsibilities you aren’t remotely qualified for. The job? Managing a car with a 1.5-liter turbo engine running around 2 bar of boost mounted where the groceries used to go. No airbag, no abs, no training wheels. Just figure it out before you get fired or, in this case, sent backward through a guardrail. Your new boss, (who ignores OSHA and HR) the Renault R5 Maxi Turbo, expects results.  Juan Carlos Fernandez knows what it’s like to start from nothing. In 1963, his family fled Cuba with an infant Juan in tow, leaving behind their home, their belongings, everything they had ever known. They landed in Puerto Rico with no roadmap, just the need to survive. His parents worked tirelessly to rebuild, instilling in him the kind of work ethic that doesn’t ask for shortcuts. By the time he was a teenager, cars had his full attention. His cousins were in the auto business, and he scraped together whatever he could to buy his first car, a $200 project. One car turned into two. Two turned into three. The hustle never stopped. If he needed more money, he worked harder. Decades later, that drive turned into Ferco Motors, the dealership he owns today.  A friend once told him the R5 was “so ugly it’s beautiful,” but to Juan, it was just beautiful. It had character, presence, and the kind of raw, unfiltered driving experience that modern cars have lost. It wasn’t built for straight-line speed or effortless performance, it was built to be driven hard, to demand something from the driver. And that’s exactly what drew him to it. The R5 is a product of Renault’s obsession with Group B, the golden era of rally racing where manufacturers built the most extreme machines they could get away with. The FIA required manufacturers to build a limited number of road-going versions to compete, and Renault’s answer was to take their humble economy hatch and reimagine it into something wild. At risk of boiling things down, and for the sake of brevity we’ll just say the engine was moved to the back, the body was widened, and the power was turned up The result was the R5 Turbo. That car made its competition debut in 1980 at the Tour de Corse, a rally known for its tight, twisting tarmac stages. French driver Jean Ragnotti piloted the car and, despite being up against much more developed machines, showed its potential. The real breakthrough came the following year when Ragnotti drove the R5 Turbo to an outright victory at the 1981 Monte Carlo Rally. It was undoubtedly good, but... was more possible?       Enter the R5 Maxi Turbo, the ultimate version, the final boss. It was built to compete with the Audi Quattro and the Peugeot 205 T16. Definitely a tough crowd. Renault brought in Bozian Racing, a French motorsport engineering firm known for squeezing every last drop of performance out of small-displacement engines. In this case they pulled 350 horsepower out of Renaults 1.5L engine. They made the car stiffer, and increased the work aerodynamics were doing.  It had some success in competition, and proved its mettle on tarmac, but as all-wheel-drive rivals took over, its time on the dirt and in the spotlight, faded.  Juan’s R5 wasn’t perfect when he bought it. It had been sitting, neglected, and the first drive was a disappointment. No boost, a failing clutch, just a reminder that even the greats need work, and time spares no one, and no thing. But with the right expertise, the right people, and a lot of effort, it came back to life, a worthy tribute to the Group B legend.  Juan Carlos Fernandez didn’t get here by taking the easy way. He came from nothing, worked for everything, and never asked for a shortcut. The R5 doesn’t give one either. It just wants you to show up for work. Continue...",

    "title": "Is This The New Le Mans Golden Age We've Been Waiting For?",
    "link": "",
    "description": "History Repeating: A New Golden Age for Le Mans Shines Brighter Than Ever The 24 Hours of Le Mans is the world’s most famous sports car race, and since its inaugural edition in 1923, the legendary event has seen fluctuating levels of manufacturer competition. Today, however, we are witnessing an unprecedented resurgence, as three iconic marques—each with a rich legacy of success—are set to join the already stacked grid of Alpine, BMW, Cadillac, Ferrari, Peugeot, Porsche, and Toyota in the battle for overall victory. Aston Martin will debut its radical Valkyrie hypercar this year, while Genesis—the luxury division of Hyundai—will enter the fray in 2026, embarking on a new motorsport chapter. Meanwhile, Ford recently announced a factory-backed return in 2027, and insiders suggest that McLaren is preparing to follow suit. A joint McLaren-Ford entry, reminiscent of their final Formula 1 season together in 1993 with Ayrton Senna, was initially explored but ultimately abandoned. However, McLaren’s announcement of a long-awaited return could be perfectly timed for the 30th anniversary of its stunning 1995 Le Mans victory. Watch this space! Aston Martin: A Lone Overall Victory, But a Storied Le Mans History Aston Martin returns to Le Mans with unfinished business. The British marque’s only overall win came in 1959, when Carroll Shelby and Roy Salvadori piloted a DBR1/300 to victory in a grueling race of attrition. Shelby, battling dysentery and carrying a nitroglycerin capsule under his tongue for heart issues, and Salvadori, who drove for 14 hours despite suffering from the flu, emerged victorious ahead of the sister Aston Martin of Maurice Trintignant and Paul Frère. Ferrari finished third, while Porsche endured its worst-ever showing, with all its cars failing to finish. Aston Martin first entered Le Mans in 1928, running nearly every edition until it shifted focus to a less-than-successful Formula 1 campaign. However, it found further glory in GT racing, winning the GT1 class in 2007 and 2008 with the DBR9, famously defeating Corvette in fierce head-to-head battles. The brand's most thrilling modern Le Mans moment came in 2017, when its Vantage GTE snatched victory from a faltering Corvette C7.R in the race’s dying minutes. Now, in 2025, Aston Martin steps back into the top class with the V12-powered Valkyrie—a road-going hypercar developed in collaboration with Formula 1 aerodynamicist genius Adrian Newey. Among its fiercest rivals? Ferrari, winners of the past two Le Mans editions with the 499P hypercar, and Porsche, the reigning World Endurance champions with a factory-backed effort led by motorsport legend Roger Penske. Ford: Iconic GT40 Dominance and a Triumphant Return Ford’s Le Mans legacy was immortalized in the 2019 film Ford v Ferrari, which dramatized Henry Ford II’s personal vendetta against Enzo Ferrari after a failed acquisition deal. Determined to exact revenge, Ford assembled an all-star team led by Carroll Shelby (yes, the ’59 winner with Aston, who was now focused on running the cars) and star driver Ken Miles, and together they steered the GT40 into a race-winning machine. In 1966, Ford famously secured a 1-2-3 sweep, though a controversial staged finish saw Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon take the victory over the Miles/Denny Hulme entry. Tragically, Miles was killed testing the car’s successor (The ‘J-Car’ which became the GT40 MkIV) but his legacy was assured. The GT40’s dominance continued, with Dan Gurney and A.J. Foyt winning in 1967—an event best remembered for Gurney’s spontaneous invention of the champagne-spraying podium celebration. The Gulf-liveried GT40 of Pedro Rodríguez and Lucien Bianchi triumphed in 1968, followed by Jacky Ickx’s legendary 1969 victory, where he deliberately walked to his car at the start in protest of the traditional sprint start, only to deliver a masterclass in racecraft by winning the race by a mere 120 meters. Ford returned to Le Mans in 2016, celebrating the 50th anniversary of its historic first victory by winning the GTE-Pro class with the modern GT, in a program managed by Chip Ganassi Racing. McLaren: The Shock 1995 Victory That Defined Its Hypercar Legacy This June is McLaren’s 30th anniversary of its jaw-dropping victory in 1995, when its F1 GTR won on debut in dramatic fashion. In tasting a sweet victory the Woking-based brand, which was better-known for its Formula 1 success, scored four of the top five positions, with only the second-placed Courage C34 prototype, that included racing legends Mario Andretti and Bob Wollek, putting up a fight. The destiny of the race win was transformed in the closing stages, as the race-leading Harrods McLaren, run by David Price, suffered gear selection problems. This writer just happened to be in pits with two hours to go when Wallace alighted and handed over to Derek Bell, and I only realized something was amiss when he insisted on briefing Bell at length before Derek climbed in, delaying the car’s departure. When it was eventually released, instinct told me to tail Andy into the garage (a journalist’s life was far easier in those days!) where he exclaimed to Price “It’s f*cked, Dave! The gearbox is completely f*cked! I’ve told Derek to leave it in sixth”. This led to a lot more swearing from Price, with whom I developed a warm friendship in years to come but, on that day, I was one of many in the vicinity who was told in no uncertain terms where to go, as he vented the frustration of losing a Le Mans victory in such cruel circumstances. That handed victory to the Lanzante-run Kokusai Kaihatsu Racing team’s lineup of JJ Lehto (who starred in wet conditions in the night), Yannick Dalmas \u0026 Masanori Sekiya. That team had solved the McLaren’s delicate gear linkage issue, which affected many of its entries, by repeatedly spraying it with WD40 at each pitstop. That helped it to win by a lap. While that remains McLaren’s sole success at Le Mans, its modern-day road cars, like the P1 and recently-launched W1, take huge inspiration from the endurance racing heritage established by the F1 GTR. The Future of Le Mans’ Golden Era Success at Le Mans cements a manufacturer’s place in motorsport history and leaves a lasting imprint on its brand identity. The race’s influence extends beyond the track, shaping the development of the world’s most celebrated hypercars. No wonder that so many marques are signing up for this current golden age of sports car racing. Continue...",

    "description": "Kia EV2 concept will preview a production car due in 2026 Production EV4 and PV5 are due this year; EV2 concept previews electric Rio replacement for 2026 Kia will reveal the production versions of the EV4 and PV5 and a concept version of the EV2 later this month. The trio will make their debuts at Kia EV Day, the Korean brand’s annual showcase event that takes place this year on 27 February. Ahead of the event, the three new models have been previewed by images that showcase aesthetics inspired by Kia’s Opposites United design philosophy. The EV4 (below) will arrive next year and rival the likes of the Tesla Model 3 and Volkswagen ID 3. It will be sold in both hatch and a fastback bodystyles, with the former the main target for the European market. It is based on the same E-GMP platform used by Kia’s existing electric cars, including the EV3, EV6 and EV9, as well as various Hyundais. Given that it is positioned towards the lower end of that line-up, it is expected to share powertrains with the EV3. That car is currently offered solely with a 201bhp motor mounted on its front axle. Two batteries are available, with the entry-level 58kWh option yielding 267 miles of range and the 81kWh pack 372 miles. The Volkswagen ID Buzz-rivalling PV5 will be the first in a range of electric commercial vehicles launched by Kia. It will be joined by a smaller PV1 and PV3, as well as the Mercedes Sprinter-sized PV7.  Kia is targeting a starting price in Europe of €35,000 (around £30,600). Two versions will be offered at launch: a seven-seat people mover and the high-roof panel van. The EV2 concept (below) will preview the production version of the Kia EV2, a new electric hatchback earmarked for launch in 2026 at a price of at around £25,000. The small, high-riding hatchback will rival the new Renault 5. The production version will share a platform with the EV4.",

While these two venerable luxury saloons are still going strong, the increasing number of SUVs on our roads means that the traditional perspective of what a luxury car actually is has dramatically shifted. SUV or saloon, a luxury car is a premium model that offers superior performance, cutting-edge technology and unparalleled comfort in both the front seats and the back, a sumptuous interior and isolating ride and noise refinement. Whether you're after sleek sports cars, high-end saloons or opulent SUVs, the options are vast. For many owners, these cars will also be status symbols above all - some powered by large-capacity diesel engines or V8s, or even electric or plug-in hybrid systems.  To help you narrow down your choices, we've curated a list of the top 10 best luxury cars on sale - and our top pick is the electric BMW i7, which sits above its peers for comfort, driving dynamics and practicality.  You might see some notable brands aren't included on this list. Don't worry: we've also put together a list of the top 10 best super-luxury cars. There you will find the even pricier Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Mercedes-Maybach models.",

    "description": "The thing about EVs is that you don’t tend to stray too far from a home charger – or, in my case, the office charger. The Mercedes EQE SUV, which was part of our long-term fleet for a few months, rarely left town. Other than a quick dash to Pune, it’s been pretty much city-bound, gently gliding over Mumbai’s clogged and bumpy roads. Most of the time, I’ve been behind the wheel, enjoying its smooth drive. On occasions when parking is a struggle, I’ve had to switch to being chauffeur-driven. Even then, I find myself preferring the front passenger seat because the rear seat, while spacious, doesn’t hit the mark in terms of comfort. The lack of underthigh support and a backrest that is a touch too upright seriously compromise the ultimate comfort you want and expect from a Merc. The other issue is that the nearly 3-metre-long wheelbase (and the absence of rear-wheel steering) makes manoeuvring through tight spots challenging – or so it seems at first. However, the light controls and surprisingly responsive nature of this 2.7-tonne electric SUV take much of the sting out of navigating confined spaces. The rear seat lacks Merc levels of comfort and plushness. It’s confined spaces I am happy to leave behind as I hit the Atal Setu and head to, yes, you guessed right, Mahabaleshwar. The drive to Mahabaleshwar is my go-to testing ground for cars. The mix of six-lane expressways, single-lane stretches, and the twisty ghat roads that lead to the hill station is a perfect workout for any car. The EQE SUV aced the first leg of this journey, sucking just 55 percent of the battery for the 190km drive (from the office) to Poladpur at the foot of the ghats. The efficiency translated to 4.7km/kWh, which is very impressive for such a big and heavy car. One of the reasons for this remarkable efficiency is the EQE SUV’s aerodynamics. With a low drag coefficient (Cd) of just 0.26, the EQE SUV slices through the air far more efficiently than most vehicles in its class. Mercedes’ engineers have focused heavily on reducing drag, and it shows – not just in the numbers but in the car’s rounded, less traditional SUV-like design. Mumbai-Mahab run drained battery’s SOC to 22 percent. This aerodynamic philosophy mirrors what we experienced with the EQS sedan, which played a crucial role in our Guinness World Records title for the longest distance travelled on a single charge. While the EQE SUV’s shape has put off traditionalists looking for a boxy, rugged silhouette – like its ICE-equivalent GLE – it’s hard to argue with the results when you’re covering long distances with minimal energy consumption. With enough range in my pocket, or rather the battery, I threw range anxiety out of the window for the last 40km up the Ambenali ghat, which, as always, was a blast. The tarmac, which is ripped apart after every monsoon, was in surprisingly good shape this year. Mahabaleshwar to Mumbai run drained battery’s SOC to 43 percent. The colossal 858Nm of instant torque from dual electric motors and their near-silent operation made for an exhilarating drive. The EQE SUV’s ride quality is a bit of a mixed bag. On NH66, it managed the countless speed bumps with aplomb, flitting over them in a way that made the journey incredibly comfortable. However, at speed, the suspension felt a bit floaty and things didn’t improve much on the Ambenali ghat. Even in its stiffest setting, Sport, the suspension couldn’t quite rein in the car’s body movements. The EQE SUV felt a bit roly-poly leaning into corners. While it’s not a deal breaker for daily use, spirited drivers will find this soft setup a bit disappointing. Gravity and a heavy right foot took their toll on the range, which plummeted by the time I reached the top. Still, I arrived in Mahabaleshwar with a decent buffer of 22 percent charge remaining. Considering I completed the drive in a brisk four hours flat, that’s pretty efficient. Under normal conditions, a leisurely highway cruise with no significant elevation changes would translate to a real-world range of around 400km. The HUD has crystal-clear graphics and is unobtrusive. To put the effect of gravity or an uphill climb into perspective, the drive back on the same route, covering the same distance in the same time, resulted in a much healthier 42 percent charge remaining! No Mahabaleshwar trip of mine is complete without the boot packed to the brim. Whether it’s weekend luggage, shifting books to stock my library in the hills, or a couple of crates of strawberries on the way back, the EQE SUV’s 520-litre boot proved adequate, despite the spare tyre sitting on the flat and wide loading area eating into space. Light-coloured trim gets dirty very easily. Charging? Always tricky when you’re out of town. The public charger at the Taj in Mahabaleshwar, which I had planned to use, was out of order – an all-too-common issue in India’s fledgling EV ecosystem. As a result, I relied on my home 3kW slow charger, which, though reliable, is painfully slow and took over a day to top up the large 90.6kWh battery. Living with the EQE SUV, it’s hard not to be wowed by the cabin. The materials, the design, and the sheer tech on offer make it feel truly special. The Hyperscreen, which stretches across the dashboard, is the star of the show. Not only is it incredibly functional, but it also transforms the cabin into a futuristic lounge, especially at night when the ambient lighting adds to the drama. The Hyperscreen with large icons is easy to read and use. These few months with the EQE SUV gave me a nice taste of the future of electric luxury.

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/maserati-grecale-review-india-friendly-maserati-434390#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Car+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "Think Maserati, and you’d probably picture a seductive, low-slung sports car or perhaps a sharply suited sedan. The Maserati featured here is of a very different type, shape and form. This is the Grecale, and by virtue of being an SUV, it’s the most India-friendly Maserati you can buy. Maserati Grecale exterior design The Grecale is Maserati’s second SUV after the Levante, which is now in its run-out phase, with production having stopped earlier this year. The Grecale is half a size smaller than the Levante, and in dimensions, it slots in between a Porsche Macan and Cayenne. The Grecale’s job is to fly the Italian flag in a segment crowded by German alternatives, and design is the differentiator. The classic Maserati elements are all there – low-set concave grille, a trio of vents at the sides, the distinctive cut to the glass house and the trident logo on the D-pillar. The Grecale is undoubtedly sporty in its stance and, like the latest Maseratis, looks better in person than it does on screen. To my eyes, though, larger headlights would have given the Grecale a stronger face. Quad exhausts establish the Grecale as something serious at the back. Not to get geeky, but the boomerang shape of the rear running lights and ridge on the bumpers are a visual link to the 3200 GT’s iconic LED lights. All in all, the Grecale looks exotic, and that’s half the job done. Maserati Grecale interior and features Grecale’s interior neatly blends a new-age vibe with an old-world feel. The Grecale is very inviting inside, too, and it’s where old-school Italian craftsmanship meets new-age tech. There’s a generous use of leather all throughout the cabin, and the pattern stitched on the dashboard is a particularly rich touch. In fact, there’s a warmth to the Grecale’s cabin that you wouldn’t get in a Porsche. I’m not entirely sold on the classic analogue clock atop the dash making way for a digital one, but you can shuffle between three clock faces or have the screen display either a compass or a G-meter or brake and throttle measure. Touchscreen climate control is (relatively) easy to use There are three other screens – of course, large in size. The 12.3-inch IP is neat, while the 12.3-inch centre touchscreen is slick to respond, though it has lots to display, so the menus take some getting used to. There’s another 8.8-inch touchscreen lower down for the climate control system, among other functions. Touchscreens for climate control are not an ideal solution, but at least the Maserati’s is among the best of the kind: swipe left or right anywhere on the screen to control blower speed, swipe up or down to adjust the temperature. In effect, you don’t need to take your eyes off the road to aim at a specific area. The Grecale does have its quirks. For instance, while the steering is home to a lot of buttons, including the start-stop and drive mode selector, you won’t find any audio or volume buttons here. That’s because they’re hidden from view, behind the steering spokes. Then, there’s no gear lever at the centre console or Mercedes-like gear stalk behind the steering wheel either. Rather, the Grecale has buttons on the dash for park, reverse, neutral and drive, with dagger-sized paddles mounted on the steering column for gear selection. And when it’s time to exit the car, you’ll realise that there’s no lever to pull; a button does the job. In terms of features, the Grecale gets quite a bit, including a panoramic sunroof, front seat heating and cooling, a head-up display, a 360-degree camera, and three-zone climate control, with many of these being paid options. There’s plenty of kneeroom, but headroom is limited, and the backrest is a tad upright. The Grecale is not an SUV we’d wholeheartedly recommend for chauffeur-driven buyers. The kneeroom is comfortable for six-footers, but the headroom is limited, and the backrest adjust is also missed. Maserati has packaged in a fold-down centre armrest with two cup holders as well as storage for a mobile phone, and rear-seat passengers get a dedicated zone for the climate control system. There’s a very usable 535 litres of luggage space behind the rear seats, and flat-fold seats mean the space can be enhanced further. Sadly, there’s no spare tyre. All you get is a puncture-repair kit. Maserati Grecale performance and powertrain The Grecale is available in three flavours. There’s the range-topping GrecaleTrofeo with the 530hp Nettuno 3.0-litre twin-turbo V6 petrol engine from the MC20. The Grecale Modena and this Grecale GT aren’t quite as special under the hood. A 2.0-litre turbo petrol engine is the source of power, but it packs in mild-hybrid tech to assist the engine at full load, and there’s also an electric compressor to help bottom-end performance. The numbers sure are promising: 330hp on the Modena and 300hp on this GT. This engine might not be large in absolute terms, but it’s got the soul of a larger engine. It’s got more to give low down in the rev band than you’d expect, and it doesn’t necessarily feel turbocharged as you go further up the rev range. The Grecale always feels light on its feet and very likeable. Find the right road, press down hard on the accelerator, and the Grecale will also rev very urgently to 6,000rpm. The 5.6-second 0-100kph time means that even in this mildest of guises, the Grecale is fast. Top speed is limited to 240kph. The Grecale sends power to all four wheels via ZF’s 8-speed gearbox. You’ll be very tempted to use the feelsome paddle shifters, but the gearbox isn’t lightning-quick in its responses and won’t grant you a high rpm downshift when you really want it. It’s best to leave the gearbox to its own devices. Maserati Grecale handling and ride quality The build of speed is backed up by a nice soundtrack. The engine sounds sweet, and the exhaust note is really wholesome. There is a buzzkill, though, and that’s the speed-warning buzzer. The other thing? The Grecale is quite muted inside and actually sounds better and louder when it passes by you. For the full sound effect, you’ll need to dial things up to Sport. There’s also a Sport setting for the suspension and steering that brings in a bit more weight and makes the Grecale feel pointier. The Grecale really comes into its own on a winding road. There’s a crispness to the whole setup; the steering is light but precise, and grip levels are good throughout. The Grecale really is up there with a Porsche Macan in handling, and that is very high praise. I’m not sure how many buyers will give handling much weightage, but the Grecale does comfort well, too. No, it’s not pillowy soft, and there is a firmness to the setup, but you won’t be chucked about even on the worst of patches. And remember I said it’s the most India-friendly Maserati? Speed breakers are the nemesis of low-slung Maseratis. Thankfully, this is not a problem for the Grecale as it glides over bumps without the underbody making ground contact. The Grecale GT packs in a few advanced driver-assistance systems, and they worked well enough on wide, well-marked roads on our route. Maserati Grecale price and verdict That’s a quick taste of the Maserati Grecale. It’s fast, comfy and stylish enough to stand out in a crowd of luxury SUVs. The thing is, the Grecale is not the largest SUV by size or engine capacity, and for the money Maserati wants for one, it’s sure to be a sticky point. Prices start at Rs 1.31 crore (ex-showroom) for this Grecale GT, which makes it more expensive than a Macan, though the Porsche is older and makes less power in base spec, too. At the top end, the Rs 2.05 crore GrecaleTrofeo does have the performance to hold its own amongst the super SUV heavyweights. The Grecale doesn’t quite make a watertight case for itself, and your decision to buy one would be one of heart over head. Then again, isn’t that true for all Italian exotics?

The late-2000s Buell XB series is a prime example. Combining aggressive streetfighter styling with bold engineering, it featured a Sportster engine with a downdraught intake, a sculpted fuel-in-frame chassis, and perimeter disc brakes. David Shrader is a bigger Buell fan than most. An aircraft technician by trade, he bought his first Buell (an M2 Cyclone) new in 1999 and has been enamored with the brand since.

    "description": "Ever heard the expression “A builder’s house is never finished?” It counts for custom motorcycle builders, too. Even though customization is their bread and butter, many of them ride bikes that are stock—or just partially modified. That was the status of Nicko Eigert’s 2012-model Moto Guzzi V7 up until recently. The founder of Indonesia’s Smoked Garage bought the V7 about a year ago as his personal daily runner, but it soon became the shop’s workhorse. And even though he had a million ideas of what he wanted to do to it, a steady stream of customer projects kept it on the back burner. Things changed when the Moto Guzzi, which had been super dependable until then, broke down. With parts on order from Italy and the V7 patiently waiting on the bench, Nicko and his team couldn’t resist making a few tweaks.…",

    "description": "Audi has silently delisted the A8 L sedan and RS 5 Sportback from their India website. The Audi A8L and the RS 5 were brought to India as completely built imports (CBUs) and their last recorded price was Rs 1.63 crore and Rs 1.13 crore (ex-showroom), respectively. We have reached out for an official statement, but Audi India is yet to revert. Audi A8L: a brief recap The last iteration of the A8 L was launched in July 2022, which was a facelift of the fourth-generation model. The A8 was available in long-wheelbase guise in India, as is the favoured choice in this segment, and in 4- and 5-seat configurations. It was powered by a 340hp, 3.0-litre, turbo-petrol V6 engine with quattro all-wheel drive. With Audi having vacated the flagship limousine segment, this space is now left to just the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and BMW 7 Series/i7. Mercedes and BMW's flagships have consistently outsold Audi’s A8. Globally, too, the A8 is towards the end of its lifecycle, while the S-Class and 7 Series are fresher products. The next-generation A8 will likely be an electric-only model, but its launch is likely some time away. Audi RS5 Sportback: a brief recap The Audi RS5 Sportback was launched in August 2021, and it came powered by a 450hp, 2.9-litre, twin-turbo V6 engine. The A5 line-up in India, in fact, could only be had in one of the two sporty iterations – RS5 or S5; the latter is still on sale. The RS5 was also pleasantly practical as it came as a 4-door Sportback unlike the 2-door coupe form of its predecessor. Like the A8, the RS5, too, is towards the end of its lifecycle. The A5, on which the RS5 is based, has moved on to its next generation overseas and already has an S5 variant in the line-up; an all-new RS5, therefore, can be expected to join the family soon. In the meantime, Audi is gearing up to launch the RS Q8 facelift in India on February 17, and you can read more about it here.
