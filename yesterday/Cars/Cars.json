    "description": "This 1993 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 coupe was modified by Singer Vehicle Design between 2015 and 2016. The “Fiona Commission” spent time in the United Arab Emirates before it changed hands in 2019 and returned to the US, where it was purchased by the selling dealer in 2025. Finished in paint-to-sample non-metallic Midnight Blue, the car is powered by an Ed Pink-built 4.0L flat-six that drives the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transaxle with a limited-slip differential. Additional features include carbon-fiber body panels, individual throttle bodies with velocity stacks, Öhlins adjustable shock absorbers, Brembo cross-drilled and ventilated disc brakes with body-color calipers, staggered-width 17” Fuchs-style forged aluminum wheels with nickel-plated spoke accents, carbon bucket seats, Espresso and Cognac leather-weave interior trim, a laminated-wood shift knob, a padded leather-trimmed roll bar, air conditioning, power windows, and an upgraded sound system with a Becker radio and a Parrot infotainment unit. This Singer-modified 964 is now offered with an accident-free Carfax report and a clean New York title.",

    "description": "You are probably already familiar with the Suzuki Access 125 because it is a common sight on our roads. Ever since its launch in India in 2007, the Access has been an extremely popular choice in the 125cc scooter category because it offers a practical, efficient and ultra-reliable scooter experience combined with zippy performance for a decent price. In nearly two decades, this is only the second major update the Access has received. So, what has Suzuki changed? Catering to this end of the Indian scooter market is tricky because traditional consumers identify with the established body style that is prevalent, but, at the same time, the company needs to keep its product fresh against its rivals. Which is why Suzuki has not strayed very far from the previous Access’ design ethos. The underseat storage space has grown by 2.6 litres to 24.4 litres. Park the old and new scooters side by side, and the 2025 model looks just new enough to differentiate itself but not so much that the average consumer will mistake it for anything else. We think the Access manages to cut a pleasing figure with its neo-retro aesthetic, and this shade of sea green only helps things further. It has two front cubbies now, but their opening is rather narrow. While not much is new in terms of features and technology, the 2025 Access has improved upon its predecessor in the storage capacity. The boot measures 24.4 litres (up from 21.8), and this scooter now has two slim cubbies on the front apron. Do bear in mind that these cubbies have a rather slender opening, and you cannot fit a 1-litre water bottle like you could in the previous scooter’s single cubby.   The Suzuki Access is very much a family scooter, but unlike most of its rivals, it never feels dull to ride. And its fun character doesn’t come at the expense of any sacrifice in practicality or handling. True to its family-scooter roots, the Access has a plush suspension setup, which never feels out of sorts unless you turn up the wick to the point where seldom any staid rider will venture. Neutral ergos, a spacious seat and balanced suspension keep you comfy. For 2025, Suzuki has given the Access a new frame and heavily reworked the engine – we will address the chassis first and the motor a little later. To be perfectly frank, ride this 2025 model and a previous-gen scooter back to back, and you will be hard-pressed to tell the difference – we actually did just that, so you can take our word for it. That’s really no bad thing because the 106kg Access feels light in traffic (despite its weight having gone up by 2 kilos) and is manageable for riders of all sizes, both attributes expected of a family scooter. Seat has grown slightly longer, and cushioning is on the firmer side. However, for all that has changed, we would have liked to see a 12-inch rear wheel on the Access with this update. Because it still rides on an archaic 10-inch unit (just like it did way back in 2007), at higher speeds and while going through turns, the Access doesn’t feel as stable as its Indian rivals that use 12-inch wheels at both ends (think TVS Jupiter 125 and Hero Destini 125).   That small gripe aside, we are happy to report that the Access retains its zippy, playful demeanour. And a big part of that is down to the tried and tested 124cc engine. This mill is energetic right from the get-go. Even if you’re holding a steady 70kph on the highway, if you open the throttle, there’s still enough left in reserve to manage a reasonably quick and effortless overtaking. Heavily revised engine retains its pep and turbine-smooth character. By and large, Japanese engines are known to have two major USPs: refinement and reliability. As for the former, the most vibration is actually felt only when you are at a standstill, as is typical for scooters. It disappears as soon as you get moving. In fact, it is so smooth that even at an indicated 90kph, there is absolutely no buzz either in the floorboard or the handlebar. Disc brake is reserved for the top two variants and has sufficient bite. In our tests, the new Access was quicker than the BS6 version in roll-on acceleration as well as the sprint to 80kph, which is impressive considering it is a little heavier now and has to comply with stricter emissions norms. Moreover, along with its energetic performance, the Access continues to have great fuel efficiency. In fact, these numbers could have been even better if the Access had start/stop tech like the Burgman, but you can’t opt for that feature here.   The 2025 Access has stuck to the same formula as its predecessor but with minor refinements all across. While it doesn’t have any one standout feature, it blends frugality, practicality and comfort with a dash of zippiness wonderfully. Another important factor to consider is that Suzukis are generally light on the pocket to purchase as well as run, which now brings us to the price. Round chrome mirrors look nice, but the field of view isn’t the best. With prices ranging from Rs 81,700 to Rs 93,300, the new Access is Rs 1,000-1,500 more expensive than the outgoing model. It is also nearly on par with competitors in pricing. The aforementioned factors are why the Access has achieved such widespread success. Even today, if you’re in the market for a new 125cc scooter, the Access remains a really compelling option. Also See: 2025 Suzuki Access video review",

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-comparison-reviews/ktm-390-adventure-vs-royal-enfield-himalayan-comparison-review-435056#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Bike+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "Two of the most compelling options in the mid-capacity category in India are the 2025 KTM 390 Adventure and the Royal Enfield Himalayan 450. While both bikes promise adventure-ready capabilities, they take different approaches to design, features, performance and ride quality. However, the most significant difference between the two is their price, and we’re here to tell you if the new kid on the block justifies its higher price tag. Form and function The latest KTM 390 Adventure embraces a more rugged ADV-focused design. While it appears more premium than its predecessor, its underbelly exhaust design deviates from traditional adventure bikes. The KTM’s headlamp easily outshines the RE’s. Available in only two colours, the KTM’s aesthetic may not appeal to everyone, but it does feel modern and carries less visual bulk than the Himalayan. However, the extensive use of plastic panels means you will need to learn to live with buzzes and rattles, something our test bike already had. The RE’s headlamp has adequate illumination. The Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 has less of a traditional ADV aesthetic and instead focuses on a more muscular naked look with a big fuel tank, minimal bodywork and a small windscreen. The larger dimensions, heavier weight and distinct side-stand lean angle make it feel like a bigger motorcycle, but the downside is that this makes it heavy and intimidating for some riders. The Himalayan’s more metal-heavy construction gives it a greater sense of durability and toughness. The 390 Adventure's TFT has a better user interface. Both motorcycles have essential electronics such as a TFT display, switchable ABS and riding modes, but the KTM 390 Adventure goes one step ahead with segment-first features like cruise control, traction control, cornering ABS and dedicated ABS modes. KTM's switchgear feels higher quality and more tactile. The KTM’s user interface is smoother, retains rider preferences even after being switched off, and has a more premium feel with tactile switchgear. Himalayan's circular TFT is legible even on a sunny day. In contrast, the Himalayan 450’s electronics feel less refined. The mode-switching response is inconsistent, and the built-in Google Maps navigation, while excellent in theory, requires an unlocked smartphone screen to function, making it less practical. The Enfield's switchgear doesn't feel nearly as tactile as the KTMs. The toggle switch to browse the menu also feels flimsy and tricky to control, diminishing the user experience. Given these quirks, the KTM’s interface feels more polished and rider-friendly.  Comfort and convenience The KTM 390 Adventure has an upright seating position with wide handlebars, making it comfortable for taller riders. Its slightly forward-leaning stance aids control, while the taller windscreen provides better wind protection. However, the non-adjustable windscreen can be intrusive for some and blocks airflow, making city riding in hot weather uncomfortable. Its LED headlamp is among the best on any Indian motorcycle, significantly outperforming the Himalayan’s. KTM doesn’t offer an alternative to their hard seat. KTM has equipped the 390 Adventure with crash bars, a bash plate and handguards, but the bike lacks a centre stand and has limited luggage-mounting points. While KTM offers optional accessories, the Himalayan takes the lead in customisation. Useful rear rack and optional touring seats make the Himalayan better equipped for a long tour. Royal Enfield offers a wide range of OEM accessories, including luggage options, seat choices and crash protection. It has better standard luggage mounting points, and its tank guard doubles up as an extra mounting location. The optional touring seat is among the most comfortable in its class, making it better suited for long rides. Off the beaten path The KTM 390 Adventure is a significant 13kg lighter than the Himalayan, making it easier to manoeuvre. The lighter weight also helps shorter riders feel more confident in handling the bike, particularly off-road. The KTM’s throttle response is precise, its electronics enhance trail riding, and its brakes offer better control. Thanks to its lighter weight, the KTM is easier to handle off-road. The bi-directional quickshifter is a great addition, making gear shifts seamless – especially when wearing off-road boots. However, the KTM’s suspension struggles with aggressive off-road riding, frequently bottoming out. While KTM offers adjustable suspension, it doesn’t cope as well as the Himalayan, even when firmed up, and most riders would prefer a well-balanced setup out of the box. The Himalayan 450, on the other hand, offers a superior suspension setup that absorbs off-road bumps effortlessly. Despite its heavier weight, it manages low-speed manoeuvres and jumps surprisingly well. The torquey engine is easy to control, and the clutch, though precise, is not as light as the KTM’s. The brakes require careful modulation, as the rear locks up easily. While lacking advanced electronic rider aids, the Himalayan still performs admirably in off-road conditions, handling about 95 percent of what the KTM does and keeping its rider more comfortable while at it. On the open road On highways, the KTM 390 Adventure is more engaging and stable and equipped with cruise control, which is a game-changer for long-distance touring. The KTM shares its main frame and engine with the 2024 KTM 390 Duke, but it features a bespoke rear subframe, swingarm and steering head for enhanced stability. It holds triple-digit speeds effortlessly and accelerates faster than the Himalayan. In our tests, the 390 Adventure was nearly a second quicker to 100kph, while roll-on acceleration is almost on par. The Himalayan 450 offers a more tractable mid-range and better overall comfort. Its plush suspension smooths out rough patches, making it the better option for long-distance touring. It also has a larger fuel tank, improving range. However, the Himalayan’s handlebar vibrates at higher RPMs, leading to numb hands after extended riding. Despite this, the Himalayan performs well as a commuter, with a tighter turning radius and smooth lane-splitting capabilities. Meanwhile, the KTM feels  smooth at highway speeds but has harsh vibrations in the footpegs at lower revs within the city. What took me by surprise were the Himalayan’s braking figures, which were pretty much on par with the KTM’s despite a significantly higher weight. Different strokes for different folks  Both motorcycles present compelling options depending on rider priorities. The KTM 390 Adventure offers lighter weight, superior electronics and stronger performance. The main attraction is that it is lighter and easier to ride than the Himalayan, and it has a chassis that is engaging both on and off the road. On the other hand, the Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 is a more rugged, comfortable and budget-friendly alternative. The KTM is clearly the better adventure bike, but the issue arises when you look at the on-road price difference, which stretches to as much as Rs 80,000-90,000 in Mumbai. If you simply want the KTM’s lighter and friendlier nature, then the lower-spec 390 Adventure X with its 19-inch front wheel is the answer, especially since it costs the same as the Himalayan. However, those willing to pay additional money for the standard 390 Adventure will probably be doing so for the extra edge in off-road performance, and that’s where the KTM’s suspension doesn’t quite match the expectation. That’s why, in this particular comparison, the Himalayan 450 just about wins by a whisker from a value-for-money perspective.

But this facelift/update/call it what you will took on a life so large that it has a new name, a new appearance, even a new chassis derivation: CXV (115 – Morgan’s age last year) replacing CX (110). That has even necessitated homologating and crashing it again.Perhaps helpfully it positions the Supersport further from the Plus Four, the traditional shape and style and still the meat of the Morgan’s output.",

    "description": "It was only fitting that the first intercity run in our long-term Curvv EV was to the Tata Motors plant in Pimpri for a special occasion – Tata Motors’ EV Day, celebrating the milestone of 2,00,000 Tata EVs sold! No other Indian manufacturer has achieved this feat, a testament to Tata’s pioneering role in the country’s electric mobility revolution. Launched in August last year, the Curvv EV is the latest addition to Tata’s electric line-up. Essentially a ‘coupe-fied’ version of the Nexon, it packs a larger battery, more power and faster charging. While we’ve yet to test its DC fast charging speeds, our first top-up was on our office’s 22kW AC charger. The Curvv EV supports AC charging at 7.2kW, which is sufficiently fast when the car is parked at work. The charging port is conveniently located in the nose, so it’s easy to access from any side. However, accessing the charging port wasn’t as simple as expected, and it had a glitch. The flush-fitting charging flap, designed to slide open via a haptic touch control on the dashboard, refused to budge. No amount of pressing or coaxing worked, and in the end, I had to physically pry it open by hand – hardly ideal when you’re plugging in regularly. This fault was reported to Tata Motors, and after a quick workshop visit, it was rectified. That said, the location of the charging port – neatly integrated into the Curvv’s nose – is a definite advantage. In our office parking, where the designated EV slot is right next to a wall, side-mounted charging ports can be a hassle, often requiring an awkward squeeze to plug in. More often than not, you end up brushing against the wall and dirtying your clothes. With the port up front, there’s none of that frustration – just a clean, open space to manoeuvre the charging gun into the socket with ease. Gliding up to Tata Motors’ plant on the outskirts of Pune took under three hours, thanks to the Atal Setu, which has changed our lives. Getting in and out of Mumbai is unbelievably easy and even pleasant. I started off with a full charge and an indicated 338km range and drove fairly hard, revelling in the Curvv EV’s high-speed stability and settled ride. But I kept an eye on my speed – not just to conserve range, but because of the swarm of speed cameras that now dot the Mumbai-Pune Expressway. A single violation can cost you Rs 2,000, and with some sections frustratingly capped at 60kph, avoiding a fine feels almost impossible. Throttle pedal has a large initial dead zone, making it difficult to modulate in stop-go traffic. The 10km climb up the Lonavala Ghat is brutal on an EV’s battery, draining range at an alarming rate. That’s why I wasn’t too concerned when I reached Pimpri with a 46 percent charge and just 140km of range left, despite having 150km to cover on the return journey. The downhill run would help me recoup some charge, and by the time I usually hit the toll plaza at the base of the ghat, my range is often higher than it was 10km earlier. So, I skipped recharging at the Tata Motors factory, eager to find out if the Curvv EV could truly pass the acid test of completing a Mumbai-Pune round trip on a single charge. Turns out, it just about could. I was much gentler on the accelerator on the return trip, toggling between Eco and City modes. In both these modes, you hit an initial dead zone when you press the accelerator pedal, so you miss that instant response EVs are known for. The Curvv EV is much more responsive in Sport mode, but I didn’t want to risk indulging in it with the battery more than half empty. On the drop down from Lonavala to the toll plaza, the electric motor’s regen wasn’t particularly effective, and despite using the strongest L3 regen mode, I couldn’t recoup as much charge as expected and only managed to claw back 2-3km of added range. The Mumbai-Pune round trip proved difficult, with the descent not recouping sufficient charge. It’s likely that the Curvv EV’s brake regeneration is deliberately not too strong because with the car being front-wheel drive, all the regen happens on the front wheels, and the regen strength has been limited to prevent excessive front-end dive. It meant that as I entered the Atal Setu, the SOC dipped below 10 percent, triggering power-saving mode and capping my speed to around 50kph. I moved to the slow lane and had the ignominy of Wagon Rs and Altos overtaking me! I’ve never driven so slowly on the Atal Setu before. I reached the office (and not home, which was another 7km away) with just 6 percent and a huge relief, finally plugging the car into our wall-box charger. Curvv’s aircon cools the cabin effectively, with the express cool working particularly quickly. Living with the Curvv EV has otherwise been painless, and it’s turning out to be an excellent city car. The big standout feature for me is the air-conditioning system. The fixed-scroll aircon compressor is silent, and during an unusually sizzling March, it cooled the cabin brilliantly. For the next few months, the Curvv EV will be my daily driver, and I’m looking forward to seeing how it fares in the long run.

Just like previous Lamborghini editions, this, too, is limited to 693 units worldwide. The bike gets exposed carbon fibre components with a special livery At 185kg, it weighs 2kg less than the V4 S on which it is based 63 Panigale V4 Lamborghinis have been reserved for Ad Personam owners Ducati Panigale V4 Lamborghini details Limited edition Ducati is the third Lamborghini inspired model  Ducati has previously unveiled two models in collaboration with Lamborghini – the Ducati Diavel 1260 Lamborghini and the Streetfighter V4 Lamborghini. Now, the Panigale V4 Lamborghini is the third collaboration between these two renowned Italian marques. This Panigale V4 Lamborghini is also the third special edition after the Panigale V4 Tricolore and Panigale V4 Tricolore Italia to be based on the 2025 Panigale V4 S. 630 units have been allocated for buyers worldwide For starters, this special edition is limited to 630 units worldwide. In addition to this, there will be 63 more units reserved for Lamborghini Ad Personam owners who can customise their Panigale V4 Lamborghini to match their Revuelto. Customisation is not only limited to the livery but also extends to the seat, brake calipers, logos, wheels and Plexiglas – all of this coupled with a colour-matched rear paddock stand.  The other 630 units come with a unique black and green livery with the number ‘63’ commemorating the year Lamborghini was founded – 1963. The livery is inspired by the same design as that of the Lamborghini Revuelto Ad Personam. The brand claims that the tail section and winglets have also been inspired by the lines of the Revuelto supercar.  Gets 2.5hp more than the standard Panigale V4 This special edition bike comes with exposed carbon fibre at the fairing, tail section, front and rear mudguard and exhaust cover. The special componentry just doesn’t end there. The motorcycle also gets a homologated Akrapovič titanium under-belly exhaust with a carbon-fibre tip, giving it a 2.5hp boost compared to the Panigale V4 range. At 185kg (wet weight, no fuel), the weight has been reduced by 2kg compared to the V4 S. Another special touch is the billet aluminium plate at the steering head bearing the bike’s unique identification number. This information is also displayed on the TFT dash during start-up. The bike continues to use the same Euro 5+ compliant, 1,103cc Desmosedici Stradale V4 engine, producing a slightly higher 218.5hp at 13,500rpm and 122.1Nm (up by 1.2Nm) at 11,250rpm. This engine comes mated to a 6-speed gearbox. Also see: Ducati Desmo450 MX revealed: A new segment for Ducati",
