    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/official-fiat-500-hybrid-arrive-november-six-speed-manual",
    "description": "Petrol-powered city car will finally enter a new generation after 18 years, using electric 500e underpinnings Fiat will begin production of the new 500 Hybrid in November – and the first official pictures reveal it has received an overhauled interior and a six-speed manual gearbox. More than 100,000 examples of the new model are expected to roll off production lines each year at the company's Mirafiori plant in Turin. Both hatchback and cabrio models will be sold. The first images of non-camouflaged pre-production models show that it will look identical to the electric 500e except for a reworked front grille to feed more air to a petrol engine. That engine will be the same 1.0-litre three-cylinder mild-hybrid Firefly engine that powers the old 500 and Fiat Panda. The new Fiat adopts the 500e's interior, which includes Stellantis's 10.25in touchscreen. Alongside this, the dashboard features a larger and squarer new storage cubby and the gearlever is elevated alongside the steering wheel – as in the old petrol 500. The move to retrofit an electric car with a combustion engine is unprecedented in the European car industry.  Several reports in March 2024 suggested that the bold measure was borne out of two key challenges.  First was the need to up production rates at the Mirafiori factory amid slow sales of the 500e and its Abarth 500e hot hatch sibling, which led Fiat to pause production on several occasions last year. Meanwhile, it ended production of the old petrol 500 (which accounted for the majority of 500 sales), as the 17-year-old model fell foul of new EU legislation on cybersecurity, which would have required a costly rehomologation effort. Fiat CEO Olivier François acknowledged the challenges, saying in a statement that the 500 Hybrid will boost production at Mirafiori \"to ensure the plant’s productivity\". He added that launching a new combustion-engined 500 in response to flagging sales of the EV serves as \"proof that social relevance is at the core of the brand mission\". Fiat previously said it would also invest €100 million (£85m) into the 500e, with plans to redesign its platform for new battery technologies aimed at improving its affordability. This suggests that an update for the EV is also due around 2026.",

    "description": "The crossover joins the larger 7 as the second car in Chery-owned Jaecoo's line-up The Range Rover Evoque-rivalling Jaecoo 5 will go on sale this year – and it will make its UK debut at next week’s Goodwood Festival of Speed. The crossover will be the second car in the Chery-owned Jaecoo line-up, joining the larger Jaecoo 7, a car that has quickly gained popularity here after amassing almost 6000 sales since it went on sale at the start of the year.  The Jaecoo 5 is based on the same T1X platform as its stablemate, as well as sibling brand Omoda’s similarly named 5, 7, 9 and recently revealed 3 – the 3 being its most closely related cousin. Unusually, the Jaecoo 5 will not be launched first with an electric or electrified powertrain. Instead, it will be powered by a 1.6-litre turbocharged petrol engine. While exact technical details have yet to be confirmed, its state of tune is likely to match the same capacity unit in the Omoda 5: 187bhp, 203lb ft, and paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. Visually, the Jaecoo 5 is a shrunken version of the 7, with near-identical front and rear end designs, but with a shorter wheelbase and a more raked roofline.   Inside, however, the 5 receives a smaller infotainment screen (its exact size has not yet been disclosed) than the 7’s 14.8in unit, and the larger car’s 10.25in floating driver’s display has been replaced by a screen housed within the dashboard. The 5 will be sold in two trim levels: Pure and Luxury. Entry-level equipment includes a six-speaker audio system, six-way adjustable seats, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Luxury trim adds a panoramic roof, wireless phone charging, and heated and ventilated front seats. Further details, including pricing, exact delivery dates and complete technical spec, will be revealed next week.",

    "description": "The Skoda Slavia, in its Monte Carlo trim, has really been turning heads. Not because it’s new, but I guess in a jam full of SUVs, a sedan wearing bright red is quite the attention-grabber. Walking up to it makes me happy the moment I see it parked there, knowing that the 1.5 TSI engine will be a delight to drive. Oh, and on a side note, I just realised ‘jam’ would be an apt collective noun for a group of cars. The storage space under the front armrest is nice and deep. So far, I’ve used the Slavia only within the city, but with summer vacations on and traffic appreciably lighter, I’ve actually been able to enjoy clear roads, steady cruising, and decent fuel efficiency, too. I’ve managed an overall figure of about 8.5kpl over this past month – not bad for a petrol automatic in Mumbai, and I haven’t been driving with efficiency in mind. You can only have a dial display of the speedo or tacho, not both together. Rather, it’s been tempting to enjoy the 150hp and 250Nm of torque, which makes it responsive off the line and also allows you to take advantage of empty stretches of tarmac. It’s amazing how quickly you’ll be nudging the 70kph speed limit around town. Beyond outright speed, though, it’s the crisp nature of its power delivery that you will enjoy every time you dab the throttle, so don’t think of this as something you can only enjoy out on highways. Have to say, though, at very low speeds, it sometimes trips up between 1st and 2nd gear, typical of so many DSGs. Indented shelf cubby neatly creates two separate handy storage spaces. Another bit that annoys me – even though it’s a far smaller issue – is the instrument display. It’s customisable and has dials, but you can only call up a speedo or a tacho dial, not both at the same time. And while I’m on about stuff I don’t like, let’s talk air conditioning. The VW Group’s India 2.0 cars were known to have subpar ACs, and while this one is just about holding up against the summer, every now and then, you will need to tweak the temperature or fan speed, and those touch controls are fiddly to use. The indentation does help, but it’s hard to get a precise change in temperature or fan speed, and you need to look down to confirm just how much has changed. Console slot should have been deeper to easily store the key fob. Such a contrast to the steering-mounted audio controls. The track selection buttons fall into hand easily, and the volume scroll wheel is simply a delight to use: quick, easy, and with a nice tactile feel as well. It’s a familiar Skoda, and it’s nice to see these on the India 2.0 cars too. Speaking of familiar Skoda traits, there’s a ‘simply clever’ bit I really like and put to use every day; the centre console cubby has an indented shelf design that creates two spaces within and neatly holds my phone on the wireless charging mat and my wallet in the space ahead. And while I’m on about storage, the boot is pretty handy, too, at 521 litres. That’s around what some SUVs offer. So, if plans materialise, I’ll be off to Goa soon, and after a raft of SUVs, I think it’s this sedan I’ll take this time around.

    "description": "The compact SUV segment continues to grow, and the latest entrant in this tightly contested space is the Skoda Kylaq. It offers everything we liked about the Skoda Kushaq in a smaller and more affordable package, so the question is: how does it stack up against the winner of our last compact SUV comparison, the Mahindra XUV 3XO? Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO exterior design and engineering Kylaq looks proportionate and mature, while the 3XO is distinctive. Let’s start with the way they look. Both models measure just under 4m in length, but the Kylaq looks more proportionate. The wide signature front grille, split headlamps and chunky bumper work well to give the Skoda a good presence. Around the side, the 17-inch alloys, chunky cladding and roof rails add some flavour, while the faux scuff plate at the back gives it an outdoorsy look. However, the small square tail-lights make it appear more like a hatchback rather than a crossover. XUV 3XO styling may not appeal to everyone In comparison, the 3XO’s tail looks abruptly cut off, as it’s based on the 4m+ Ssangyong Tivoli. Like newer Mahindras, the 3XO has a polarising design, to say the least. Vertically oriented headlights, C-shaped daytime running lamps and a sharply cut bumper lend the 3XO its distinctive face. Like the Skoda, the Mahindra also gets 17-inch rims, body cladding and roof rails to further its SUV look. The rear is characterised by a full-width LED light bar and a chunky bumper. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO specificationsKylaqXUV 3XOLength (mm)3,9953,990Width (mm)1,7831,821Height (mm)1,6191,647Wheelbase (mm)2,5662,600Boot capacity (litres)360295Ground clearance (mm)189201Tyre size205/55 R17215/55 R17Engine3 cyls, 999cc, turbo-petrol3cyl, 1197cc, turbo-petrolPower115hp at 5000-5500rpm131hp at 5000rpmTorque178Nm at 1750-4000rpm230Nm at 1500-2500rpmGearbox6-speed torque converter auto6-speed torque converter auto Overall, the XUV does appear to be the more substantial of the two, given that it’s the widest and has the longest wheelbase in the segment. The XUV also has the advantage of 201mm ground clearance; the Kylaq’s is 189mm. However, the Skoda does have an edge when it comes to boot space, measuring 360 litres up to the parcel shelf, while the Mahindra has a 295-litre capacity. Both can also be expanded further thanks to split-folding rear seats, though the Skoda has a deeper boot. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO interior space and comfort Kylaq interior is built tough, but all-black scheme detract from sense of space All-black theme with green trim gives Kylaq cabin a sporty vibe; quality is solid. These two also take a different approach on the inside. The Kylaq, as expected, closely resembles the Kushaq, with shared elements like the high-quality, 2-spoke steering wheel, digital instrument cluster and touch-based panel for climate control. However, Skoda has added some flash value by giving it olive green inserts on the dashboard, door panels and centre console, along with a light-textured fascia. Overall, the design is clean and uncluttered and has a solid build, which is only furthered by the reassuring ‘thud’ you get when closing the doors. It has a dual-tone theme, but the black upholstery can make you feel hemmed in, especially when compared to the XUV. It has a practical interior, too, with large doorbins, plenty of cubbies, and some typically Skoda ‘Simply Clever’ touches like the phone slots on the front seatbacks, a ticket holder on the windshield, and more. Headroom and kneeroom are decent, but it’s only wide enough for two. The Kylaq’s front seats are better in this company, given that they offer better support and feature electric adjustment and ventilation. But in terms of the backseat, it falls behind the Mahindra. It has an adequate amount of legroom and headroom for average-sized adults, but the narrow cabin and the seat contouring mean it is best suited for two passengers. Rear occupants get their own AC vents, Type-C charging ports, adjustable headrests and a centre armrest with cupholders. XUV 3XO cabin feels airier and more premium Looks and feels more premium, thanks to soft-touch materials and light upholstery. In comparison, the XUV 3XO’s interior looks and feels more upmarket. The light-coloured upholstery uplifts the space, as does the panoramic sunroof, but the ivory seats will be challenging to keep clean. Top-spec versions get a soft-touch finish on the dash; there’s a generous use of gloss black, and elements like the steering wheel, window switches and light/wiper stalks feel top-notch. It’s also nice that the XUV gets physical buttons and knobs for the dual-zone climate control. Like the Kylaq, the 3XO has plenty of storage spaces in the cabin, with large doorbins, a good-sized cooled glove box, and more. XUV 3XO's rear seat has more room and can comfortably fit three adults. You’ll appreciate the view you get out of the cabin from the XUV, and the bonnet flares give you the feeling that you’re driving an SUV. The front seats, even though they’re well-cushioned, aren’t as accommodating as the Kylaq’s, and you’ll also miss that you don’t get electric adjustment or ventilation. But it’s at the rear where the Mahindra has the most evident advantage. Owing to its width, three adults can sit comfortably in the XUV, and the long wheelbase means that legroom is plenty, too. If anything, accommodating the mechanism for the sunroof has eaten into headroom, but that’ll only be an issue for those taller than 6 feet. Amenities at the back include AC vents, a centre armrest with cupholders, a 12V port and a USB Type-C charger.

Common features include LED headlamps, 17-inch alloys, a sunroof, a wireless charger, a digital instrument cluster, a touchscreen infotainment system with wireless smartphone integration, leatherette upholstery, auto climate control, six airbags, traction control and ISOFIX child seat mounts. Commendably, both the Kylaq and XUV 3XO have a 5-star BNCAP rating. However, they both have features unique to them as well. Kylaq one-ups XUV 3XO with powered and ventilated front seats Ventilated front seats unique to the Kylaq. The Kylaq’s front seats have ventilation and power adjustment, which the XUV lacks, and we found the output from the Skoda’s 4-speaker and 2-tweeter audio system to be more consistent. The Skoda makes do with smaller 10-inch and 8-inch screens for the infotainment and cluster, respectively. However, its screen features a newer UI compared to its stablemates, and on the whole, this system is slick and has good graphics. XUV 3XO gets Level 2 ADAS, 360-degree camera, rear disc brakes, and more 3XO’s panoramic sunroof will be a big draw. Coming to the XUV 3XO, the AX7 L featured here gets a larger panoramic sunroof, larger 10.25-inch screens, an electronic parking brake, a 360-degree camera, more connected tech, a 7-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, rear disc brakes, and Level 2 ADAS (blind-spot monitor, autonomous emergency braking, lane-keep assist, and more) over the Kylaq’s range-topping Prestige variant. The ADAS features work well on a clearly marked road and can be switched off completely, too, should you want to. I found the blind-spot monitor, which appears in the instrument cluster, to be particularly useful. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO performance and refinement Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO performanceAccelerationKylaqXUV 3XO0-20kph (seconds)1.471.370-40kph (seconds)2.972.780-60kph (seconds)5.134.720-80kph (seconds)7.977.610-100kph (seconds)11.6911.050-120kph (seconds)16.0215.7420-80kph (seconds)6.386.3840-100kph (seconds)8.728.11 Now, on to the driving bits. Both SUVs are powered by a 3-cylinder, direct-injection, turbo-petrol engine, but they vary in displacement and output. The Kylaq has a smaller 1.0-litre unit that puts out 115hp and 178Nm, while the 3XO’s larger 1.2-litre motor produces 131hp and 230Nm. Both versions tested were paired with the same Aisin-sourced 6-speed torque converter automatic gearbox. 131hp 1.2L mill feels strong throughout rev range. Given the difference in output, the Mahindra is naturally quicker in a sprint to 100kph, completing it in 11.05sec to the Kylaq’s 11.69sec. The Skoda claws back in the 20-80kph run, posting an identical time of 6.38sec, but it is marginally slower in the 40-100kph run. Skoda 1.0 TSI feels stronger than expected 115hp 1.0 TSI engine punches above its weight. The Kylaq’s engine is slightly slower to respond at low speeds, and that’s something you’ll have to get used to in city driving. But then on, power delivery becomes smooth and progress easy. The TSI engine punches above its weight and feels significantly stronger than its cubic capacity would have you believe. And that’s most evident in the mid-range. What helps make the most of the mid-range are the paddle shifters, which add to the engagement. And even in fully automatic mode, the gearbox does its job rather smoothly. In isolation, the Kylaq’s engine is refined, but it is the noisier unit in comparison. XUV 3XO feels punchier at low speeds The XUV 3XO has a significant power and torque advantage, and you feel as much from the get-go. Drive modes also help fine-tune the experience. Just as you start out, you’ll feel that the XUV 3XO is more responsive at low speeds. However, you have to be mindful – at least in city driving conditions – that it’s better in Zip mode, where power delivery is the smoothest. If you’re in Zap or Zoom mode, you will find that the engine bunches up its power quite early in the rev range. And you don’t want that when you’re in very tight moving conditions. Modes alter response and steering weight. Of course, when the road opens up, you’d want to switch to Zap or Zoom mode, which will have the engine breathe freer and feel different in its power delivery. While the Kylaq’s engine is the strongest in the mid-range, the XUV’s mill feels strong throughout. So, right from low revs, it’s more alert and responsive, and even in the mid-range, there is a constant and steady stream of power. You don’t have to work the engine to get the best out of it. Paddle shifters add to the Kylaq's drive experience. The 3XO is quick and fun, but you will miss paddle shifters. Gear shifts via the lever are responsive enough, though. What’s remarkable is the Mahindra engine’s refinement. Even when revved hard, it doesn’t thrum like you’d expect a 3-cylinder unit to. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO fuel efficiency XUV 3XO was more frugal in our testing Kylaq returned a better mileage on the highway, while the XUV 3XO sipped less fuel in the city. Coming to the important topic of fuel efficiency, we put the two cars through our test loops in Mumbai city as well as on the highway. And it’s the XUV that delivered a higher figure of 9.9kpl in town. The SUV’s auto stop/start keeps the engine off for longer durations, which could have helped the economy. The Kylaq managed 8.7kpl in the city, but it did edge past on the highway, delivering 13.3kpl to the XUV 3XO’s 13kpl figure. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO fuel efficiencyFuel efficiencyKylaqXUV 3XOCity (kpl)8.709.89Highway (kpl)13.3613.01 Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO ride comfort and handling Kylaq corners better, but XUV 3XO feels more stable at high speeds Around the bends, the Kylaq feels more engaging. The Kylaq doesn’t get steering modes like the XUV 3XO, and in general, it has a lighter steering wheel, but it’s nice and smooth, and you can have great fun in the corners. You also get the feeling that this chassis could actually take on a larger, more powerful engine, maybe the 1.5 TSI for a Kylaq RS? When cruising on the highway, the Kylaq drives like a bigger car, but over undulations, there is more up-and-down movement than you get in the 3XO. And if you talk specifically in comparison to the 3XO’s ride comfort, the Kylaq is more absorbent at lower speeds, and over bumps and potholes, you’ll sense that there’s a bit more wheel travel as well. XUV 3XO's driving modes noticeably affect steering feel. The XUV 3XO, too, feels fun to drive on a twisty road. Notably, its drive modes also change steering weight progressively. You get a good feeling of control at the steering wheel, but the standout element is the grip that you experience around corners. So, you can carry a lot of speed with a great deal of confidence. At higher speeds, the 3XO feels poised and composed, and you can attribute that to the relatively flatter ride than the Kylaq. On the flip side, the low-speed ride is a bit firmer than the Skoda, but not to the extent of being a dealbreaker. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO price and verdict Both compact SUVs trade blows on the price front They're close in terms of driving experience, but the Mahindra feels like a more complete package. In terms of pricing, the Skoda Kylaq and Mahindra XUV 3XO are about at par for comparable trim levels. The fully loaded XUV 3XO AX7 L featured here is pricey at Rs 15.79 lakh (ex-showroom, Mumbai). But forgo the ADAS, 360-degree camera and electric parking brake, and you can get the AX7, whose Rs 13.99 lakh price tag is identical to that of the top-spec Kylaq Prestige AT. Talking about like-priced variants, there is a bit of give and take in features, but they’re still close. The duo is also close in terms of driving experience, the 3XO being marginally faster, while the Kylaq is more entertaining in its handling and slightly more absorbent in its ride quality. Where the 3XO moves ahead is in its plusher interior, more refined engine and more room for passengers. The advantage in fuel economy also tips the scales in favour of the Mahindra. Keen drivers will enjoy both models, no doubt, but it’s the XUV 3XO that eventually makes you feel like you’ve got more for your money.

He launched his career at the tender age of 15 as an intern at Ironwood Motorcycles, under the guidance of Arjan van den Boom. He’s had a hand in many of the amazing machines that have graced our pages—and he’s learned a thing or two, judging by this beautifully executed BMW boxer bobber. “I was there with Arjan when he built the Mutant, and most of the other BMWs that put Ironwood on the map,” Sam tells us. “It was an extremely exciting time for me, as you can imagine. Most of my friends had jobs in supermarkets or cafés and I was helping build these amazing-looking and sounding custom bikes.”…",

But it’s a lot harder when the bike in question has already been customized, particularly if the existing mods don’t harmonize with your vision. The man behind the HB-Custom name, Holger Breuer, knows this all too well. When this 1978 Kawasaki Z1000 arrived at his workshop in Hussum, Germany, it had already been turned into a streetfighter with a hodgepodge of pricey parts. But it was a far cry from what Holger’s client wanted, both aesthetically and practically. “It came with a 180-wide rear tire, a K\u0026J swingarm, and high handlebars,” he explains. “It had a short rear with a Giuliari seat for one person, and a very loud Marving four-into-one exhaust system.…",

    "description": "Citroen is seriously evaluating bringing the e-Spacetourer to India to enter the fast-growing premium MPV space here. If it materializes, it will be brought to India as a full import, but given the ongoing FTA talks, Citroen could have the opportunity to price it attractively. This MPV is available with diesel and electric powertrains abroad, but it is only the EV version that’s being evaluated for India. e-Spacetourer gets a 75kWh battery with up to 348km range Available in two trims with two wheelbase options abroad Could be positioned between BYD eMax 7 and MG M9 Citroen e-Spacetourer: what is it? Measuring over 5meters in length in its long wheelbase guise, the e-Spacetourer is a typical upright and boxy MPV in similar vein to the upcoming MG M9. It packs in a 75kWh battery that powers a single electric motor producing 136hp. Citroen claims a range of 348km in a single charge on the WLTP cycle. The e-Spacetourer also gets a short wheelbase version with a smaller 49kWh and a claimed range of up to 320km, but it is likely that the long wheelbase variant with the larger battery will be brought to India. The biggest USP of the such a body style is, of course, the second and third-row space. On that front, the e-Spacetourer has an incredibly spacious cabin with captain chairs for the third row that are just as comfortable as the middle-row. The middle-row even gets a swiveling function in certain configurations with fold-out tray tables.  Case for the Citroen e-Spacetourer in India The luxury MPV space has steadily been growing over the last few years. Just last year alone, Toyota sold as many as 1,155 units of the Vellfire in India, and its sibling, the Lexus LM, is also very popular among the wealthy. Mind you, these are MPVs priced well above Rs 1 crore (ex-showroom). Meanwhile, at the lower end of the spectrum, the Kia Carnival has sold 967 units in between January to May this year. And with MG joining the ranks soon with the M9, this segment is only going to grow further. So, while it is a niche, there certainly is a business case here. Citroen e-Spacetourer: positioning in the market The e-Spacetourer, however, isn’t as luxuriously appointed as a Kia Carnival or the MG M9. It’s cabin is functional, yet gets the basics right with plush seats and adequate creature comforts, which means Citroen could price it attractively against the similarly sized Carnival and M9. More importantly, it is likely to be brough to India from the UK, and given India’s ongoing FTA talks, Citroen might just be able to get the pricing right. Upon launch, it could fit in the space between the BYD eMax 7 and the Kia Carnival.  Also See: Mahindra BE 6, XEV 9e Pack Two variants add bigger 79kWh battery Renault Duster EV confirmed by sister brand Dacia's CEO",

The Dominar 400 is now priced at Rs 2.39 lakh, while the Dominar 250 costs Rs 1.92 lakh (both ex-showroom, Delhi). Dominar 400 gets ride-by-wire, four riding modes, and a new bonded glass LCD Dominar 250 now offers four ABS modes 2025 Bajaj Dominar range: What’s new? Both motorcycles get electronic upgrades and ergonomic changes for 2025 The most notable change is the addition of ride-by-wire on the Dominar 400, which now enables four riding modes – Road, Rain, Sport, and Off-road. These alter throttle response and ABS intervention. The Dominar 250 retains its mechanical throttle setup and now comes with four ABS modes. Both versions now feature a colour LCD bonded glass speedometer and new switchgear that have been borrowed from the Pulsar NS400Z.  Additionally, a small integrated visor has been added above the instrument cluster to reduce glare. Other shared updates include a revised handlebar designed to improve comfort over long distances, and a new carrier with a GPS mount has been added too. Bajaj has also updated the switchgear, which now looks and feels more premium. Both remain mechanically unchanged and the Dominar 400 continues to be powered by a 373cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine producing 40hp and 35Nm, while the 250 uses a 248.8cc motor with 27hp and 23.5Nm.
