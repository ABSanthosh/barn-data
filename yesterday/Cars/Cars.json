    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/has-alpines-new-hot-hatchback-struck-chord-enthusiasts",
    "description": "Clio RS may be dead but its spirit lives on in the new A290, says Prior I’ve just spent some minutes talking to Autocar’s road testers about the Alpine A290, the quick version of the new Renault 5 EV. What’s great is that we weren’t talking about where the charge port was or how far it could go or whether the driver assistance systems were infuriating. Instead it was an old-fashioned chat about lift-off oversteer (not as much as in an old Renaultsport hot hatch but more than most of the competition) and whether it should have had an additional steering knuckle on its MacPherson struts to reduce its torque steer (it just about gets away with it). They were also intrigued that Alpine had left it front-wheel drive, rather than taking any temptation, if it had any, to add rear-wheel drive to the mix by fitting another motor at the back. That’s something that’s “technically possible”, admitted Alpine, but only slightly reluctantly to a direct question about it, at the A290 launch event.  The truth is that almost anything is technically possible, but it comes with cost and complexity, and besides, Alpine is still a fan, it professes, of lightweight cars. And if an electric car can’t be as light, at least not yet, as a similarly sized and powered combustion-engined car, Alpine can do things with control weights and suspension response to at least make it feel lighter than any of the competition. The near-1500kg A290 is weighty by ICE car standards for a sub-four-metre-long hatch, but in the greater scheme of modern EVs, it’s really not so much. Deciding that it should have the same 52kWh battery size as the regular 5 and keep front-wheel drive only might have just been a budgetary decision, but I think it’s also a wise one from a dynamic perspective. As our Illya Verpraet just said to me, if you find an EV that offers a choice of two- or four-wheel drive, it’s almost a certainty that the 2WD version drives better. I’ve thought and said it of the Porsche Taycan and the Volvo EX30: the rear-driven, single-motor variants ride more deftly and steer more sweetly and with more agility than the pokier dual-motor counterparts. Anyway, I’m just pleased to find a new car that talks to enthusiasts in the way we were used to talking about cars. The A290 is a new-tech vehicle with an old-school feel.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/lion-kings-peugeot-508-pse-meets-505-gti",
    "description": "Stephen Dobie bids farewell to Peugeot's performance saloon and compares its most significant ancestor When was the last time you saw either of these cars? The Peugeot 505 sold over a million but, because of the equally vicious hands of rust and scrappage schemes, scant few still survive on British roads. Even fewer roam freely upon them. The now six-year old Peugeot 508 PSE won’t score as many I-Spy points, but given Peugeot has recently axed it from sale – it wants its whole range to have an EV option – it’s going to remain the choice of the brave few. Especially in the form represented here. Dear reader, of around 7000 cars overall, Peugeot UK has sold a grand total of 155 examples of the 508 Peugeot Sport Engineered since its 2021 launch, around a third of which are the (arguably prettier) five-door fastback rather than the more practical estate. BMW has sold tens of thousands of quick 3 Series in that time. The big, luxe French car remains one of the automotive world’s most curious and often inventive places – and one of the most easily snubbed by buyers. What’s more significant is that the 508 PSE takes performance Peugeots with it, at least for the foreseeable future. For the first time we can remember, there’s no meaningful sporting initialism in the Peugeot price list. For the first time since the 505 GTi was launched, perhaps. So you’re looking at the bookends of quick modern Peugeots. And, my, aren’t they handsome. This chiselled and chromed 1983 example has been brought along by John Yearron and there’s an emotive story woven into it. His grandad bought it brand new and it has since passed down the family; his dad sadly passed away before being able to restore it as hoped. John took the role and the car now runs regularly rather than being hidden away. The day after this photoshoot, John’s son rode to his first day of school in it. It’s what classics – and their preservation – are all about. The 505 lived an uncommonly long life. It was produced between 1978 and 1992 in Europe but continued to be made into the early noughties around the world. Like its 504 predecessor, it possessed a hardiness that had global appeal. The GTi badge perhaps didn’t mean as much then as it does today, and Turbo and V6 versions were quicker. But the GTi still packs a punch, its 2.2-litre four-cylinder petrol engine possessing 128bhp and 139lb ft for a 0-62mph time of 9.8sec. Perhaps more promisingly, it’s rear-wheel drive – the last Peugeot production car to make that claim. Unless you count the 508 PSE in one of its bamboozling array of drive modes. This plug-in hybrid is the most powerful Peugeot road car yet, with its mixture of 1.6-litre turbo petrol four and two electric motors making 355bhp and 384lb ft for 0-62mph in 5.2sec. It’s perhaps not as quick as you might expect alongside its 41-year-old ancestor, but then it does have around 600kg more to propel. Thankfully, its suspension, brakes and tyres have all had a thorough upgrade over a stock 508 to match the jump in performance. Adaptive damping adjusts with your drive mode, and should that be Electric, then you might just have a rear-driven Peugeot on your hands once again – albeit briefly and pegged at 110bhp. Not that the old 505 trumpets its rear-drive layout like the German saloons it once rivalled. You get the sense of an inherent rightness to its chassis but no more. There’s no danger of its modest power and torque figures – inevitably delivered at quite high revs – ever disturbing the peace below. Perhaps the Turbo invokes some actual mischief. But that’s not to say the GTi isn’t anything other than pleasant to drive. The front end tucks into corners intuitively, the steering is smooth and communicative, and while there’s almost comical roll and lean into corners, it’s all part of the car’s rich dialogue with its driver. Committed cornering in this Peugeot feels like it resembles those wild pictures that fill the 1980s Autocar road testing archive and yet it’s all without loss of control or momentum. Crucially, you will be having a ball at speeds markedly below the 60mph single-lane limit, which no modern performance car – even a lot of recently retired hot hatches – can truly claim. The engine is hard work, mind, but with the increasingly rare five-speed manual of John’s car, you will relish playing your role. Just prepare to use third – occasionally even second – on hills like these. Anyone familiar with a 205 GTi of the same era might relish the four-cylinder rasp that accompanies it all too, even if the two don’t actually share an engine. The 505 breathes with the road and builds your confidence, all helped along by its slim hips and abundant glass. Cars like these may crumple in crash tests but they don’t need to be draped in cameras and sensors like tinsel on a tree, either. The basis of a really good car – of Peugeot’s famed ride and handling balance – courses through it, though it does give the vibe of a repmobile done good rather than an outright performance hero, which perhaps explains its comparative scarcity alongside 205s now. But isn’t every car maker’s range all the better for having cars like this on the price list? Flawed as the modern 508 may be, it’s already missed, and we can only hope the increasingly spicy EV powertrains being deployed elsewhere in the Stellantis group can find their way into future fast Peugeots. If the supple 505 GTi can inform how they drive, all the better. Because alongside it, the PSE places too many layers between you and its thoughts. It’s a very accomplished car that can cover ground quickly but you often feel like you’re having a conversation with someone in another room rather than face to face. Perhaps it’s a little mean to point that out, because broadly this is a car I really rather like. Knowing the areas where it could be sharper simply frustrates rather than outright offends. Once you’ve become accustomed to the overeagerness of its steering, you’ll find a car that’s keen and alert and whose grip is evenly distributed across its axles, which allows you to depend on (and exploit) them both. With a heavy front bias to its power split, this never mimics a BMW M340i for fun, but it makes a decent fist of putting a smile on your face. Bumps the 505 simply glides over will make you wince in the 508, though, as its overwrought 20in alloys compress into them. You don’t really lose speed but it’s simply more evidence of an otherwise plush car being quite stiffly sprung. But then it’s nice the engineers were allowed to crank it up this far: wider tracks, Alcon brakes and gnarly Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tyres betray a development team keen to make their mark, and against its contemporary rivals it would feel more composed. Its ability to whoosh around as an EV for 20 or so real-world miles goes some way to justifying that kerb weight too. Indeed, in most circumstances you will let the car default to Electric or Hybrid among its modes – all the better for easing the ride and letting the eight-speed auto do its own thing when the engine rumbles into life. There’s no real reward from flicking the paddles up and down yourself, and if you ask for too many downshifts in a row on the approach to a corner, you’ll be left impatient as the car does none… and then all at once. It comes with the paradoxical frustration of many performance plug-in hybrids: the complex powertrain that makes it so quick and interesting also adds the weight and complication that blunts a little of its spirit. Peugeot ramped this 1.6-litre up to 266bhp in the RCZ R: how much sharper might the 508 have felt equipped with only that? But then it would have remained a niche product while lacking the crucial messages it’s been tasked with relaying from the hybrid, four-wheel-drive 9X8 Hypercar of a pricey World Endurance Championship programme. The iconic performance Peugeots were light and simple. The PSE is neither. But its complexity is laced around a heck of a lot of character, and it looks flipping fantastic. Beside the classy 505 its winglets and stickers could look gauche, but the overall aesthetic reeks of glamour. Especially with its frameless windows, forever an exotic little Easter egg when tucked into an otherwise sensible car. In my week with the 508, I was stopped frequently to talk about it. If you’re brave enough to take the plunge on one as they exit the Peugeot dealer network, expect the same star treatment. You really won’t see many others",

It all began when Tobias van Schneider—a German multi-disciplinary designer living in Brooklyn—spotted a custom BMW R80 on the street. Enamored, he nabbed a photo of it and sent it to a friend. That friend happened to be the founder of Myth Motor, Matias Corea. Matias immediately recognized the bike and knew its creator—Argentine-born Sebastian ‘Seba’ Achaval, who works under the moniker ‘oneYedeer.’ Matias connected Tobias and Seba, and the idea of ‘The Escape Machine’ was born. Initially working with a running 1984 BMW R80ST, Tobias and Seba started hashing out ideas. “Anyone familiar with me knows I’m passionate about my work,” says Tobias.…",

    "description": "You may have seen enough of the Mahindra Thar Roxx, Force Gurkha 5-door and Maruti Suzuki Jimny during our Off-road Day feature, so I’ll keep the introductions short. The Thar Roxx is more than just a longer, 5-door version of the Thar because it’s built on a new chassis, packs in more tech and has a few added off-road tricks up its wheel arches, too. Force’s Gurkha 5-door adds length, doors and practicality to the Gurkha 3-door we know and love, and it also debuts a more powerful engine. The plucky Maruti Suzuki Jimny hasn’t changed in any way, shape or form since its launch last year but promises a very different experience to the others. First order of business? To judge the trio for what they are – off-roaders. Thar Roxx vs Jimny vs Gurkha 5 door off road performance  The three tick the off-roader essentials checklist with tough ladder-frame constructions and low range. The Jimny is the only one to use solid axles at both front and rear, promising greater articulation, while the Thar Roxx and Gurkha 5-door use a combo of solid axles at the back and comfort-biased independent front suspensions. The Jimny is the odd one out in terms of footwear, running highway-terrain tyres, while the Thar Roxx and Gurkha come shod with standard-fit all-terrain tyres. An on-paper comparison will tell you that it’s the Thar Roxx with the best approach angle, the Jimny with the best departure angle and the Gurkha with the best ramp breakover angle and water-wading ability. The Roxx is great off-road and feels as able as the Thar 3-door; Off-road info is a cool touch; Rear diff can be locked by button. But what are they really like in the rough? It’s 4-Low and over to our favourite off-road playground – Learn Offroad at Pali, Maharashtra. The Thar Roxx is quick to dismiss any doubts about its off-road ability being compromised by the wheelbase extension versus the three-door Thar’s. The Roxx is doing the same obstacles and with a higher degree of convenience, thanks to its move to an easier-to-twirl electric power steering. It’s the easiest of the three off-roaders to manoeuvre, too, as we learn. Roxx 4x4 with automatic transmissions promises to be even more so thanks to what Mahindra calls ‘Intelli-turn’ that independently brakes the inner wheels to reduce the turning radius on slippery surfaces. The other major upgrade to the Roxx is a button-operated electronic rear differential lock (the Thar uses a mechanical-locking rear diff) that helps prep the Mahindra for an obstacle in advance. It does its job, enabling the Roxx to claw its way out of trouble without any of the mid-obstacle snappiness of the 3-door’s auto-locking unit. A point to note about the Thar Roxx 4x4 manual featured here is that clutch modulation isn’t very smooth. Gurkha is hardcore, but its height and weight can be intimidating; Front and rear diff locks only on Gurkha; Only Gurkha gets shift-on-the-fly 4x4. Next up is the Force Gurkha 5-door. You sit high off the ground, which means great visibility on trails, but the first-floor seating also accentuates side angles and descents, and this can be unnerving. Also, there’s no escaping the sensation that there’s a lot of SUV around you. It exhibits the most weight transfer over articulations, too, but the longer wheelbase does help the Gurkha 5-door feel more grounded than its sibling. Unique to the Gurkha are its front and rear mechanical-locking differentials. With the rear diff locked, the Gurkha finds grip when there’s seemingly little of it, while the front diff lock is your ally in the most extreme situations. But while the diff locks unlock new abilities, they don’t always work. Calling them to action requires a firm pull of the levers, and even then, you’re not quite sure if they’ve engaged. There were also times when we couldn’t unlock the diffs; it’s an irritant in trying conditions when you need your vehicle to be on your side. The Gurkha feels the most mechanical and old-school of the three, and I’m sure everyone will accept that. 4x4 aside, Jimny’s small size and light weight are a boon off-road; H/T tyres are surprisingly good off-road; Jimny gets 4x4 but no diff locks. It’s actually the Jimny with the fewest off-road frills – no off-road modes or differential locks. However, it champions the cause of small and light is right. The Jimny’s size puts you at ease in the rough, and there’s comfort in knowing a helping hand (or two) is enough to get the lightweight Jimny out of a sticky situation. You will have to work the Jimny’s engine the hardest to keep momentum but stick to the right line out, and the plucky Suzuki will scrabble its way through the tricky stuff. On a side note, the Jimny’s manual gearbox needs a firm push, and the clutch isn’t the easiest to modulate. A Jimny with an automatic transmission delivers a far nicer experience.  The learnings at Learn Offroad are that the Jimny is the least intimidating, the Gurkha feels the rawest, and the Roxx strikes a great balance between ability and sophistication. Thar Roxx vs Jimny vs Gurkha 5 door exterior and features Five-door off-roaders they may be but there’s the compact Jimny on one side and the significantly larger Thar Roxx and Gurkha 5-door on the other. The Jimny is the shortest, narrowest and lowest among the three. It rides on small 15-inch wheels and almost looks like a miniature in the company of the other two. It’s not the one to give you an ego boost if that’s what you want from your off-roader. The Roxx is the longest in overall length and wheelbase and looks the business, particularly in top-spec form that has 19-inch rims. That Jeep Wrangler vibe is unmissable, too. Over to the desi G, the Force Gurkha, which, at over two metres tall, looks the most substantial. Its 18-inch rims help balance the shape, while the snorkel, windshield bar, roof rack and rear ladder make it look ever-ready for adventure. Roxx feels most upmarket inside. Opt for mocha upholstery if you intend to go off-roading; Digital dials look snazzy but not user-friendly; Thar Roxx offers the most room for luggage. The three offer very different experiences inside. It’s a climb into the Thar Roxx’s cabin. However, the Roxx immediately impresses with what is the most upmarket interior here. The overall material quality is the best here, and the large touchscreen and digital dials also do their bit to up the ambience inside. The touchscreen is nice to use and packs in off-road data screens, too, but all features weren’t functional on our test car. Also, the menus on the digital dials are cumbersome to navigate. The Thar in top-spec AX7 guise goes the distance with features such as a powered driver’s seat, ventilated front seats, 360-degree camera, wireless phone charger, electronic parking brake, and even ADAS, which I’ll get to in a bit. Seat comfort is fine, and the high driving position gives a good view of the world outside. However, there’s not enough foot room on manual gearbox versions, and the pedal covers also worked themselves loose over our time with the Roxx. Tall Gurkha gives the best view of the outside. Its dash is basic, and the quality is not befitting of a Rs 18 lakh SUV; Digital screen among few frills in the Gurkha; Third row gives flexibility but limits luggage room. You’ll need to trek your way up into the Gurkha’s high-set cabin, but the effort rewards you with a commanding driving position. The front seats will also accommodate the largest of individuals with ease. The Gurkha feels airiest, at least up front, with a sizeable space between the front seats. That said, the Gurkha also feels the most basic inside, and overall fit and finish are a few notches down as compared to its rivals – frankly, it’s not in keeping with the Force’s price tag. Features-wise, the Gurkha packs in a digital instruments cluster and a 9-inch touchscreen that’s big but basic. There’s no auto climate control either. Jimny feels compact inside. Its dash is functional and goes with the off-roader vibe; Orange backlit dials are a link to the Gypsy; You can fit a weekend’s luggage into the Jimny. Access to the Jimny’s front seats is the easiest. The front seats are comfy, but you sit close to your co-driver; it really feels like a small vehicle. And because you don’t sit all that high, you don’t get the same view out as you do in the other off-roaders, though I’d still rate visibility to be good. The dashboard is functional, and the material quality is decent. Maruti’s 9-inch touchscreen is good to use, but the reverse camera could do with more pixels. Thar Roxx vs Jimny vs Gurkha 5 door interior and practicality Now, on to the back seats. The Thar’s rear door handles are vertically oriented, and you will need to use the footboard and hand grips to pull yourself in. Once in, you’ll be more than satisfied with the space and comfort on offer. There’s enough knee room for six-footers, the seat is wide enough to host three passengers, and there’s also the option to adjust the backrest angle. Then, there’s the panoramic sunroof that does its bit to enhance the rear seat experience, particularly on a day of fine weather. Jimny feels the smallest, but its rear seat is adequate for two average-sized adults. The Maruti Jimny sits lowest to the ground, and that helps when getting in, but do note that the rear door aperture isn’t all that big. Unsurprisingly, the Jimny feels the smallest inside and is actually certified only as a four-seater – seating for just two at the back. Even so, larger-framed individuals will be sitting shoulder to shoulder. A pair of average-sized adults will find space adequate, though.  The Gurkha once again calls for the most effort to get into. Once inside, you’ll be a bit surprised because, for a vehicle so large, it’s not all that roomy. The knee room is limited, and it doesn’t help that the seat can’t be slid back to make more space. But the Gurkha has one thing that the other two off-roaders don’t – a third row of seats. It adds seating flexibility but isn’t without compromise. Access to the third row is only via the tailgate, which isn’t easy, and while the front-facing seats are comfy, the wheel well eats into the foot room. The large Gurkha is surprisingly tight on legroom. Getting in requires the most effort, too. Also, fitting luggage in the limited space available blocks access to the third row. There’s a luggage rack on the roof as an alternative, but we’d advise against using it as it’ll only worsen the Gurkha’s top-heavy dynamics. The Jimny’s tailgate swivels open to reveal reasonable luggage room, while the Thar Roxx’s two-part tailgate gives access to the most accommodating luggage area. The Jimny and Thar also give the option to fold the second row to make more space for luggage. Roxx offers the comfiest rear seat; its panoramic sunroof lifts the ambience.   Thar Roxx vs Jimny vs Gurkha 5 door engine and gearbox It’s the Thar Roxx that offers the widest variety of engines and gearboxes. There are petrol and diesel mills, each with manual and auto gearbox options. However, those looking specifically for 4x4 will be restricted to the diesel manual or auto. There’s no petrol 4x4 Roxx, at least for the moment. Featured here is the Roxx diesel 4x4 manual. The Gurkha 5-door is yours in a single diesel-manual avatar, but it runs the latest iteration of Force’s Mercedes-derived 2.6-litre diesel engine, which ups power and torque to 140hp and 320Nm, respectively. The Jimny, on the other hand, is a petrol-only model, though you have the option of a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed torque converter automatic. Jimny’s dull 1.5 petrol engine lacks punch for highway drives. What are they like to drive on the road? Let’s go in the order of engine power. First up, the Jimny, whose 1.5-litre naturally aspirated petrol engine makes a humdrum 105hp and 134Nm. The Maruti manages low-speed urban settings and off-road environments adequately well, but it’s when you take the Jimny out onto the open road that you’ll experience its weakness. It doesn’t have any punch, it’s slow to rev, and when you need to overtake in a hurry, well, you’ll have to either downshift or flatten your foot on the accelerator pedal and wait patiently. The clunky 5-speed manual gearbox doesn’t make frustrated downshifts any more enjoyable. Moving on to the Gurkha, the first thing to talk about is, of course, the updated engine; 140hp is not a massive figure for a vehicle of this size and weight, but it sure beats the 90hp the Gurkha was launched with. The new iteration of the engine feels a lot readier with its power delivery. It doesn’t have that commercial vehicle vibe that the older Gurkha engine had. It also revs a bit more, with ‘bit’ being the operative word, because, by 3,000-3,500rpm, the engine is done with its best. Engine aside, even the gearbox doesn’t like to be rushed. The gearbox has a long throw, so you’ll have to extend a bit, particularly for first and second gear, and gear shifts need a bit of effort. Strong diesel engine makes Thar Roxx most enjoyable to drive. The Roxx’s performance stands out, particularly in this company. Mahindra’s mHawk 2.2-litre diesel engine in this 152hp and 330Nm state of tune feels the most powerful, the punchiest and even the sportiest. The unit feels alert at low speeds, it’s got plenty to give in the mid-range, and it also revs quite quickly for a diesel. Its power and grunt do so much to uplift the driving experience. Helping here is the six-speed gearbox that’s really nice to use. Clutch modulation, as mentioned, needs care at low speeds, though. Thar Roxx vs Jimny vs Gurkha 5 door ride and handling Typically, the steering doesn’t get mentioned in the list of highlights on an off-roader, but things are different on the Thar Roxx. Its new-gen electric power steering is leagues ahead of the units on the Jimny and Gurkha. The steering is light at low speeds yet gives you the confidence that you need at high speeds. Even the turning circle is rather nice forwhat is a pretty substantial vehicle. On the flip side, the Roxx can’t hide its ladder-frame underpinnings. It’s unfazed by big potholes, but out cruising, the ride remains busy.    It’s the Jimny with the best ride comfort. Low-speed rides are nice and absorbent; even at higher speeds, it feels quite planted. Of course, the fact that the Jimny sits relatively low to the ground makes a big, big difference here. All’s not perfect, though. You’ll have to work with the slow-geared steering (it needs more lock than you’d expect) and the unusually large turning circle that takes away from the dinky Jimny’s ease-of-use quotient. The added power helps, but Gurkha is happiest on a gentle cruise. The Gurkha feels the largest from behind the wheel. Its high centre of gravity will force you, pun intended, to go easy, especially on a winding road. As for ride comfort, the Gurkha feels at home on bombed-out sections of roads, but there is some steering kickback, and you’ll also feel judders coming through the body. However, for the size of the potholes that the Gurkha can flatten, ride comfort can be described as cushy. What the Gurkha needs is uprated braking. The front-disc and rear-drum setup doesn’t feel strong enough. Thar Roxx vs Jimny vs Gurkha 5 door safety features None of the three have a Global NCAP or Bharat NCAP safety rating yet. In terms of standard safety features, the Gurkha offers just the basics, such as dual airbags, ABS and rear parking sensors, but it handily packs a tyre pressure monitor. The Jimny and Thar each get six airbags as standard, electronic stability control, hill descent control, hill hold control and ISOFIX child seat mounts. The Thar’s higher-spec versions add front parking sensors, a tyre pressure monitor, a 360-degree camera and rear disc brakes. Its range-topping variants go a few steps further with segment-first camera and radar-based ADAS. There’s auto emergency braking, lane keep assist and high beam assist. Auto gearbox versions even feature adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go. The features are a great additional safety net and make the Thar Roxx feel more complete than the other two. Thar Roxx vs Jimny vs Gurkha 5 door price and verdict The Gurkha 5-door has a substantial road presence, and Force’s updated engine brings a noticeable performance upgrade. However, the Gurkha still makes for a very committed choice. It’s great off-road in the right hands, but the package as a whole just feels way too raw for something that costs Rs 18 lakh (ex-showroom). A three-year/1.5 lakh kilometre standard warranty and four free services sweeten the deal to some extent. The Jimny is the most affordable of these 4x4 off-roaders. Prices start at Rs 12.74 lakh for the Zeta manual and top off at Rs 14.79 lakh for the Alpha automatic. Push for deals and discounts, and you could save upwards of Rs 2 lakh on the listed prices. Judged purely as an off-roader, the Jimny impresses. It’s an unintimidating, scrappy little thing that’ll put a smile on your face in the wild. The thing is, the Jimny isn’t quite as nice as everyday transport. The small cabin and unexciting engine are to blame. There’s also the matter that the Jimny just doesn’t have the road presence many want from their off-roader. In this comparison, it’s the Thar Roxx that ticks more of the boxes of interest. It’s got the right look and the right image, and that’s a great starting point. The tough demeanour is backed by genuine ability off-road, a polished on-road driving experience and enough thrills and comfort to make the Roxx feel like an all-rounder. It makes the most convincing case as the only vehicle in the family, and that’s why it’s the one we’d readily recommend. Prices for the Roxx 4x4 variants start at Rs 18.79 lakh and go up to Rs 22.49 lakh for the fully loaded automatic version. The Thar Roxx is the most expensive model here, but pricing is actually tempting once you factor in all that the Mahindra packs in. PS: Not to end on a bummer, but if you’re interested in a Roxx, you’re quite late: 1.76 lakh people booked one within 60 minutes of bookings opening!

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-vs-tata-nexon-diesel-comparison-433597#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Car+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "The newest entrant in the compact SUV space is the Mahindra XUV 3XO, which builds on the strengths of its predecessor, the XUV300, and ups its desirability quotient on account of a new interior, more features and an overall fresher design language. Mahindra’s changes seem to have paid off, as the 3XO has been well received by the market, with waiting periods on the rise. We put the diesel manual version through our real-world tests and, for perspective, compare it to the Tata Nexon diesel – one of the best-sellers in the segment – to find out which is better. The XUV 3XO’s squat stance, larger 17-inch alloys and connected LED tail-lamps give it a more premium look than the 300. However, certain design elements could come across as overdone to some. The Nexon’s sharper styling – the distinct Tata family look, coupé-like roofline and harmonious curves – lends it a more modern look. While both cars are similar in dimensions, the XUV 3XO’s wheelbase is much longer, which translates into more cabin room (more on that later). The Nexon sits slightly higher above the ground with a clearance of 208mm versus the XUV’s 201mm.   Mahindra XUV 3XO interior and seating The XUV 3XO’s cabin certainly looks more upmarket, thanks to a generous use of bright colours and a segment-first panoramic sunroof. Furthermore, soft-touch materials on the dashboard and door cards, as well as the dimpled, leather-wrapped steering, feel high quality – the overall fit and finish are top-notch. On the whole, the Mahindra’s cabin makes you feel like you’ve spent your money well, although it will require more effort to keep clean. Narrow seat, limited thigh support on offer in the Mahindra. The cabin fares well in terms of user-friendliness, too – ergonomics are agreeable, storage areas are well-defined, and the use of proper buttons and knobs makes things easier to use on the move. The driver’s seat, however, isn’t very comfy due to a snug backrest, inadequate thigh support and a cramped footwell, leaving no room for a dead pedal. XUV's longer wheelbase liberates more room. The rear seat experience is much better, though, with a broader seat, a comfier backrest angle and an overall greater sense of space than the Nexon. The shoulder room is good, too, so three abreast will be an easier fit. However, thigh support for the outer passengers will feel inadequate due to the curvy seat base design. What’s nice is that even the middle occupant gets a three-point seat belt as well as an adjustable head restraint. Three abreast comfier here; adjustable headrests, 3-point seat belts for all.   Tata Nexon interior and seating Shifting focus to the Nexon, the dark-coloured cabin hampers its sense of roominess and makes it appear a lot smaller, at least visually. The dashboard sports some modern-looking bits like a floating touchscreen, two-spoke steering wheel and capacitive touch controls for the HVAC system, but these bits are finished in piano black, which is likely to pick up surface scratches and smudge marks easily. Nexon's firm backrest isn’t very comfy. The Nexon continues to be plagued by ergonomic foibles, such as the inconvenient placement of its USB ports deep in a recess and the awkwardly angled bottle holders in the door. The buttons on the thick-rimmed steering protrude out a fair bit, and a wireless charging pad has replaced the front cup holders. Supportive seating in the Nexon, though contoured for two. The front seats have a ventilation function, but the seats are about as narrow as the 3XO’s. Knee and legroom at the rear are tighter, and even though there isn’t any dearth of shoulder room, its back seat seems to be designed to accommodate just two adults, as the thick, concave side bolsters force the outer passengers inward. Also, the middle passenger will have to make peace with the tall central floor hump and protruding air-con console. Adequate shoulder room, but concave shape is not comfy for outer occupants. In terms of boot space, the Nexon’s is a bit larger than the XUV’s, and its loading lip is higher, too. Interestingly, the 3XO only gets a temporary spare tyre (T135/90 R16), which is one of the reasons its boot space is more than that of its predecessor, which had a larger spare. Also, for an otherwise well-equipped car, the 3XO doesn’t get a parcel shelf as standard; it has to be bought as an accessory.   The Mahindra XUV 3XO has a much lower starting point, with its base variant priced at Rs 9.99 lakh – Rs 1 lakh lower than the Nexon’s. For this comparison, we have the XUV 3XO’s second-from-top AX7 variant priced at Rs 13.69 lakh and the Nexon’s fully loaded Fearless +S DT variant, which costs Rs 14.70 lakh. The Nexon’s Fearless variant is priced at Rs 13.70 lakh, but it misses the JBL sound system and the sunroof. The Mahindra also gets a fully loaded AX7 L variant priced at Rs 14.99 lakh, which adds ADAS, a 360-degree camera and an electronic parking brake. Excellent fit and finish and high-quality materials used in the cabin; Wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto didn’t work in test car; Bright colours, large sunroof elevate the cabin’s appeal; Footwell is too cramped in an otherwise user-friendly cabin. The Mahindra doesn’t get ventilated front seats, which the Nexon offers, but even this AX7 variant gets 17-inch alloys (vs Nexon’s 16 inchers) and a panoramic sunroof and rear disc brakes, which the Tata doesn’t get. As far as their user experience, user interface and sound systems go, the Nexon certainly has an edge. The touchscreen feels nicer to use, and the JBL speakerssound more immersive and deliver a better aural experience. In our XUV 3XO test vehicle, many features, such as wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, hadn’t been activated. Even the different sound modes didn’t change the audio experience. Performance is stronger, and acceleration times are better, too; Diesel engine sounds gravelly and coarse at all times; The sound quality of the JBL speakers is excellent; Its dark colour scheme hampers the sense of roominess. What worked better, though, were the XUV’s LED headlamps, which illuminated the road more evenly and had a better spread, too. Interestingly, the Nexon’s 360-degree camera is clearer in the day, but in low-light conditions, the XUV’s two reversing lights brighten up the area better. The Nexon’s single reversing light results in a camera feed that isn’t as clear, although it displays a much wider view. Both the cars are powered by 1.5-litre, four-cylinder turbo-diesel engines mated to 6-speed manual transmissions. But that’s where their similarities end. To meet stringent BS6.2 emissions norms, Tata uses a Lean NOx Trap (LNT) and diesel particulate filter (DPF). It is accompanied by the cost-effective Passive Selective Catalytic Reduction that eliminates the need for a urea tank and an injection system, which are a part of the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system. The XUV 3XO diesel deploys the latter, which is more expensive as it warrants a separate AdBlue tank and other ancillaries. It also needs regular maintenance as owners have to refill the AdBlue tank at fixed intervals, which is an added cost. Right off the bat, the Mahindra’s diesel feels smoother and more refined. Yes, you can hear some diesel clatter at idle, but the engine note isn’t as coarse or as gravelly as the Tata’s. With 117hp and 300Nm, the XUV’s diesel has the numbers in its favour – 2hp and 40Nm more than the Nexon’s. However, its 1,469kg kerb weight makes it 112kg heavier than the Nexon diesel, which negates its advantage on paper. Like other Mahindras, a crisp throttle response lends it a nice feeling of power each time you dab the accelerator. There is some turbo lag below 1,700rpm, but the gush of torque beyond that makes the XUV sail past slower-moving traffic with ease. The Tata’s engine feels stronger, thanks to its lighter kerb weight and more aggressive power delivery. Turbo lag is also managed better, and the drive modes, which transform the way the Nexon behaves, make a significant difference. In ‘Eco’ mode, it feels starved of power in the interest of efficiency. However, dial it to ‘Sport’ mode, and the Nexon sprints forward with gusto. In our tests, both cars were neck and neck when accelerating from 0kph to 100, but in rolling acceleration, the Nexon leaves the XUV trailing by a significant margin in every gear. So, while the Nexon diesel impresses with its performance, refinement isn’t its strong suit. The gravelly diesel note gets progressively louder as you spin this engine harder.   The Mahindra XUV 3XO gets an automatic engine stop-start system to save fuel while idling, whereas the Nexon gets an Eco drive mode to abate fuel consumption. In our real-world test, the Nexon’s 1.5-litre diesel delivered an average fuel efficiency of 18kpl, which is 2.5kpl higher than what the XUV 3XO diesel achieved. In the city, the Nexon bettered the XUV’s number by 3kpl, delivering 16.5kpl. On the highway, the Nexon returned 19.4kpl in our tests, 2kpl better than the Mahindra. Also see: Mahindra XUV 3XO real-world fuel economy tested, explained Tata Nexon real-world fuel economy tested, explained Typical of a Mahindra, the XUV 3XO’s underpinnings feel tough. It soaks up harsh blows from bad roads with an added layer of cushioning, resulting in a plush low-speed ride, although the suspension can get quite loud while at work. At highway speeds, too, the XUV feels planted, and while vertical movement is greater than the Nexon’s, body movements aren’t to the point of feeling uncomfortable. There are steering modes on offer in the XUV 3XO that alter the weight and resistance of the electric power steering, and while ‘Sport’ mode makes the steering unnaturally heavy, ‘Comfort’ feels light and effortless, which is what most users are likely to prefer. While on the topic of user-friendliness, the clutch pedal doesn’t warrant any more effort than the Nexon’s, and even though its gearbox has long throws, it feels smoother and easier to slot into gates. The XUV gets rear disc brakes (the Nexon gets drums at the rear), so despite being 112kg heavier, in our panic braking tests from 80kph to a standstill, it stopped at a shorter distance. XUV’s suspension tackles bad roads with an added layer of cushioning; The Nexon is sportier to drive, and high-speed stability is excellent. The Nexon feels sportier thanks to sharper steering, a tighter chassis and an overall stiffer suspension setup. Its structure feels inherently robust, and it shrugs off bad roads and does so in a quieter manner. What’s also nice is that the Nexon remains glued to the road at highway speeds, and the body roll is well in check. However, since its suspension isn’t as absorbent as the XUV’s, passengers in the Nexon are likely to feel sharp body movements over rough sections of road, especially at city speeds.     The Tata Nexon brings a lot to the table, such as a spacious cabin, a long list of features, and a fantastic infotainment and audio experience. And besides feeling tough, it boasts a 5-star Global NCAP crash-test rating. The 3XO has scored five stars, too. What’s more, the Nexon’s strong diesel engine makes it both quicker and much more fuel-efficient than the Mahindra XUV 3XO. However, the XUV 3XO’s diesel engine is far ahead on smoothness and refinement; its driving controls are lighter, and ride quality in the city is plusher. A generous use of bright colours and higher-quality materials make its interiors feel more upmarket, too. Yes, it misses ventilated front seats, a very popular feature these days, but it makes up for it with others like a panoramic sunroof and ADAS (on the AX7 L), for a price very close to the Nexon’s. In summary, while the Nexon has strong fundamentals, it is the Mahindra that feels more polished and upmarket, and that’s why it wins this comparison test. Test scorecardMetricXUV 3XONexonCommentsComfort8/107/10The Mahindra has a comfier back seat, and ergonomics are more user-friendly. The Nexon’s front seats are better, though.Performance7/109/10Not only is the Nexon much quicker in terms of acceleration, but it is also much more fuel-efficient than the XUV.Refinement9/107/10The Tata’s diesel engine clatter is audible and sounds coarse, too. The XUV’s 1.5-litre is relatively smoother and quieter.Value8/107/10The XUV 3XO has a lower starting price, and its AX7 variant (as tested) is nearly a lakh cheaper than the top-spec Nexon.Safety9/109/10Both cars get similar safety kits, but the XUV also gets rear disc brakes and the option of ADAS, which the Nexon misses.Ride9/108/10Even though both feel tough, the XUV’s low-speed ride feels plush. The Nexon feels more confident at higher speeds.Handling8/109/10The Nexon’s steering is sharper, and its chassis feels stiffer, making it sportier and more enjoyable to drive.Build \u0026 quality9/108/10XUV’s interior feels better built and looks more upmarket, with better quality, fit and finish.

    "description": "Photography by: Johnathan Rothman (@thejohnrothman) 1956 Jaguar XK140 Convertible Raced in period by Briggs Cunningham and Denise McLuggage Location: California, USA Country of original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: S818207 Mileage: 76,025 miles Colour: Red Original colour of delivery: Carmine Red Price: Call for Price The car As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer a unique collector-grade Jaguar. The Jaguar XK140 represented the epitome of front-mounted 6-cylinder Jaguars in the mid-1950s. This particular example is without a doubt the most storied one in the United States of America, as it was raced and campaigned by two of the most prolific personalities in the American racing world. The car was first campaigned by renowned Briss Cunningham, who was indisputably one of the most pivotal figures in postwar sports car racing, making a profound impact as a driver, team owner, and constructor. Briggs then proceeded to donate his XK140 to Denise McLuggage, an American auto racing driver, journalist, author and photographer. She pioneered gender equality in motorsports and journalism in the U.S., and was among the very first women taking part in professional automotive racing. Her racing achievements included winning the grand touring category at Sebring in a Ferrari 250 GT in 1961, and a class win in the Monte Carlo Rally in a Ford Falcon in 1964. She also participated in the Nürburgring 1000 km sports car race. This car's past is in fact so fascinating that it recently enabled it to earn a very coveted spot in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (MSHFA), where it resided in 2022 alongside other giants of the racing world. What's perhaps even more remarkable, is that the car presents in unaltered condition. It's been kept 'as-is' by its 4 owners (Briggs Cunningham, Denise McLuggage, and 2 other owners, including the present one), and is showing a splendid amount of patina. Everything about this car is original and has remained untouched over the last 58 years - the chassis, body panels, engine, transmission, suspension, wheels, seats, dashboard materials, and more, are all original. And, magically, 58 years later, it still elegantly runs and drives. Continue...",

    "description": "2011 RUF RT Roadster Location: Miami, Florida Original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: - Mileage: 6,900 miles Price: Call for Price   The Car | 1 of 1 RUF RT Roadster With a reputation for creating the pinnacle of bespoke performance sports cars, RUF can sometimes afford the luxury of creating one-off coach-built vehicles for close family friends and special clientele. The one-of-one RUF RT Roadster was the result of a unique idea presented by such a client to produce a true B-pillar Targa that hadn’t been available from Porsche from the 993 until the 991. This meant engineering a new body based on a 2011 997.2 chassis to create a Targa that would seamlessly combine nostalgia with the exhilarating driving feel RUF is so well known for. The team wanted to pay homage to the very first Targas produced which were famous for their ability to fully remove the rear window to provide a ‘soft window’ Targa experience. The RT Roadster reimagines the iconic rear quarter panel openings that feed the intercoolers, breathing cold air into the twin-turbo 3.8-liter flat-six that produces 650 horsepower delivered to all four wheels through a PDK transmission. Underneath rests a special RUF-tuned suspension and carbon ceramic brakes on all four corners. Finished in a truly bespoke Chromaflair satin paint, the lines of this RT Roadster flow as the paint transitions through its various layers of flake and its undertones are exposed. The interior is finished in contrasting red leather with silver stitching, extended carbon fiber accents, and painted Chromaflair satin interior trim, showcasing RUF's meticulous attention to detail. Factory options include phone connectivity, foldable carbon bucket seats, color-matching hard top panels, matching red leather luggage belts on the rear parcel shelf, and center lock wheels. The RT Roadster was unveiled at Rennsport VI in 2018 and subsequently featured in a MotorTrend article. It has been privately enjoyed by its original owner since then before being offered for sale to the general public. Continue...",

    "description": "Someone wise recently told me: “A watch tells more than time.” Essentially, this means your watch is an extension of yourself, and different watches fit different people's personas. That saying is actually quite fitting for this bike – the gorgeous Royal Enfield Goan Classic 350. It isn't too different from the Classic 350, but it's targeted at a rather different rider – someone who wants to be unique but doesn't want the compromises that come with this style of bike. RE Goan Classic 350: Design, changes to Classic Design is one of the foremost ways the Goan Classic differs from the standard Classic. Starting at the front, you've got these very retro-looking whitewall tyres, which are found only on a microscopic amount of bikes available on sale today. While the tyres have a retro look, a welcome surprise is that the Goan Classic runs cross-spoke laced wheels, which permit tubeless tyres. The tyres are CEAT’s new Zoom Classic rubber, developed specifically for the Goan Classic. While the front wheel is a 19-incher, like the bike it is based on, the rear wheel is a 16-incher in proper bobber fashion. Then, the Goan Classic trades the Classic's handlebar for tall ape-hanger bars that put your arms almost straight and in line with your shoulders. It also has more forward-set pegs from the Meteor 350, and together, these changes put you in a properly relaxed riding position. The Goan Classic is also the only RE 350 to get the metal switch cubes from the larger 650s. Even the exhaust muffler is new and has a bit of a raspy note to it. You also have a cantilevered rider's seat, which is just 750mm off the ground, making it the second-lowest seat on any Royal Enfield today, after the Super Meteor 650. But my favourite design element is this articulated rear fender that moves with the wheel. The logos and badging on this bike also align with the retro custom aesthetic and add that little bit of extra pizzazz to its design. The Goan Classic’s colour palette is very funky and out there, and those who like to make a statement with their bikes will like the paint options. There are four colours to choose from, but my favourite has to be the Trip Teal (nice naming, RE!). RE Goan Classic 350: Ride and handling, comfort So, how do all these changes affect the riding experience? The short answer is, not much. The Goan Classic feels very similar to the Classic 350, which is a very pleasant feeling, with the only difference being how you're seated. The tall ape hangers work rather well when you're riding, and there's no strain on your arms or shoulders. After a brief accustomization period, I found my rhythm, and I suspect it will be the same for most others. The only small caveat here is that while making a tight U-turn, you need to plan your movements correctly and be a little more mindful of the tall bars. And because of how you're seated on the bike, you'll also bear the brunt of bad roads a little more than the Classic. That said, the Goan Classic is nowhere as uncomfortable as its competitors from Classic Legends. Honestly, aside from the different riding positions, the rest of the riding experience is pretty much identical to the Classic 350. This means it's the same relaxed, comfortable, and smooth yet torquey bike we've come to know and loved over the years. RE Goan Classic: Verdict All in all, the Goan Classic 350 feels like a cut above the rest of the 350s in terms of fit and finish, quality, and uniqueness. This will also be reflected in its price, as it will probably be the most expensive 350 RE. Prices start at Rs 2.35 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) and go up to Rs 2.38 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), making it Rs 42,000 more expensive than the Classic 350. With the Goan Classic, you're getting a very unique-looking thing with proven fundamentals, a custom bike straight from RE. So, if you're one of the few people who use their watch not just to tell the time but to make a statement, I think the Goan Classic will be right up your alley.

    "description": "Royal Enfield has introduced a new addition to its 350cc lineup, the Goan Classic 350. It is a bobber-style motorcycle that blends retro aesthetics with practical features. It has been launched at the company’s Motoverse riding festival for Rs Rs 2.35 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) for the base variant and Rs Rs 2.38 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) for the top-of-the-line variant.  Costs Rs 42,000 more than the Classic 350 349cc engine remains mechanically unchanged  RE Goan Classic 350 details The Goan Classic retains the trusted 349cc engine, delivering 20.2hp and 27Nm of torque. The main chassis also remains unchanged and it has a kerb weight of 197kg (2kg heavier than the Classic 350) and a 13-litre fuel tank.  Its design elements include a low-slung bobber stance, single-seat layout, and mini-ape hanger handlebars. The motorcycle comes with an optional pillion seat, which can be mounted at the base of the rider’s seat.  Additionally, Royal Enfield has given the Goan Classic 350 a set of white-wall tyres from Ceat, mounted on spoked rims that support tubeless tyres which is a first in the 350cc segment. The motorcycle also sports a 16-inch rear wheel (down from the 18-inch wheel on the Classic 350), paired with a 19-inch front wheel. The Goan Classic features metal switch cubes borrowed from Royal Enfield’s premium 650cc range and it will be offered in four striking colour schemes. It has a seat height of 750mm, and a set of forward-set footpegs taken from the Meteor 350. Despite its low stance, Royal Enfield has increased the rear suspension travel to 105mm (up from 90mm on the Classic 350). Also see: RE Goan Classic 350 review: More than just a dressed-up Classic",

    "description": "The Lexus ES sedan has received a second facelift in international markets, suggesting that the new, eighth-gen model is still some time away. Revealed at the recently concluded Auto Guangzhou show in China, the refreshed ES gets changes to its exterior design, and less buttons on the inside. Incidentally, the ES sedan is not only a popular model for Lexus in India, accounting for 58 percent of the brand’s sales in October, but it’s also an in-demand model in China, where over 10 lakh units have sold so far. ES facelift gets RX-inspired grille design Gets new 14-inch touchscreen infotainment Remains mechanically unchanged On the outside, the updated ES sports a new design for the spindle grille that seems to be inspired by the RX. There are new, sharper, matrix LED headlights with new boomerang-shaped DRLs. An LED light bar now connects the mildly tweaked tail-lights, which also get L-shaped LEDs. The cabin of the ES now features a larger 14-inch touchscreen infotainment that also houses all the controls for the climate control system – there are fewer physical buttons overall, especially around the centre console and gear lever. What Lexus calls a ‘Silver Lance Moon Ridge’ trim can also be seen on the dash and doors. Buyers in China will be able to spec their ES in a Snowy Night White interior theme, or a two-tone Tanzanite Snow Night. The ES facelift doesn’t get any mechanical changes for the Chinese market, and is likely to be brought to India in the same manner. In India, it gets a 218hp, 2.5-litre petrol-electric hybrid powertrain and retails at Rs 64.00 lakh-69.70 lakh. It rivals the Mercedes E-Class, BMW 5 Series and Volvo S90. While an India launch date is uncertain, expect Lexus India to bring the refreshed ES here next year.
