    "description": "Bentley's go-faster Bentayga derivative swaps W12 shove for V8 gargle and more besides A drift mode and titanium plumbing from a respected but rather extroverted Slovenian supplier are not what we commonly associate with SUVs, but this is the Bentley Bentayga Speed, after all.And Bentley has successfully gone GT3 racing with the improbable, 2.3-tonne Continental GT and once enlisted Juha Kankkunen to fire a bio-ethanol-powered, rag-top Conti Supersports to more than 200mph on a frozen stretch of the Baltic Sea. So nobody can say the company doesn’t have a bit of an unpredictable streak.The main thing here is that, compared with the previous Bentayga Speed, the 6.0-litre W12 engine is out, its 626bhp and 664lb ft being supplanted by a lighter 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 with more power and only a fraction less torque.Performance is monstrous – think 193mph and a BMW M5 Touring-beating 0-60mph time – yet the suspension calibration in Comfort mode is supposedly as per the regular Bentaya, so on paper this car should still have manners. With a starting price of £219,000 (with an awful lot of head room for optional spend), the Speed slots into the range between the standard V8 Bentagya and the Bentayga EWB.You can most easily tell it apart from the others by its vast 23in wheels (optional, but most owners will have surely them), which facilitate 440mm carbon-ceramic front brake discs – the largest of any production car. Those and the big spoiler.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/audi-replaces-indicator-stalks-buttons-new-%C2%A338300-q3",
    "description": "The crossover is one of Audi's best selling models and will arrive in September priced from £38,300 The Audi Q3 has returned for a third generation, bringing a fresh design and a quite radical interior operational change. One of the German car maker’s best selling models – having sold more than two million globally since its 2011 launch – the crossover will arrive in September priced from £38,300. While sporting a much-changed new design compared to the previous model, one of its most interesting changes comes inside, where traditional control stalks have been replaced with a new solid block with buttons.  What Audi refers to as its ‘steering wheel control unit’ houses everything from drive selection and light functions to windscreen wiper operations and even the indicators. All are operated by physical buttons and the panel ends do not, like a stalk, move. If customer feedback is positive on the new control unit, it will likely be rolled out across the rest of the range. Audi isn’t the first car maker to try and reinvent operational stalks, the most notable being Tesla which, with the facelifted Model 3, did away with them altogether, moving indicators to touch-sensitive buttons on the steering wheel - something, after feedback, it reversed with the updated Model Y. What’s more, removing the previous model’s gear lever has freed up space in the centre console for a pair of cup holders and a wireless charging pad. Elsewhere, the Q3’s cabin gains a new 12.8inch infotainment screen and 11.9inch instrument cluster. The new Q3 arrives with a fresh exterior design which is a big departure from the more rounded second-generation car it replaces.  The crossover borrows much of its lighting signatures from the new A6 Avant: at the front it uses its slimmed LED lights, and at the rear the same light bar and rear light designs. The Q3’s rear badge is, like most new VW Group cars, also illuminated. Again based on the same MQB platform as the Audi A3 and VW Golf, the new Q3 opens with the 148bhp four cylinder mild-hybrid and is topped by a 268bhp plug-in hybrid with 75 miles of engine-off range, double that of the car it replaces. With that top spec powertrain, the Q3 is priced at £45,800. The Q3 is also offered with a £40,000 148bhp diesel which, alongside the new A6, will be some of the final Audis to offer the fuel option. What remains unclear is the future of the hot RS Q3 variant. The previous generation used the Audi RS3’s 394bhp turbo fi ve-pot, but Autocar understands that engine will soon be retired (in part down to increasingly stringent emission regulations) and Audi is increasingly pushing towards EVs.",

    "description": "In the ADV world, the GS moniker carries some serious baggage – but the good kind. A brand that’s instantly recognisable, even in the remotest of trails. But what if you want that GS clout without lugging around upwards of 250kg of flagship girth off-road? That’s where the F 900 GS rolls in. It costs Rs 1.25 lakh more than its predecessor and is now lighter, livelier, and loaded, but there’s also a bit of a catch. BMW F 900 GS design and quality (8/10) The F 900 is now more compact and lighter than its predecessor The F 850 GS looked like a skinnier F 850 GSA. The F 900 GS, however, comes across with a rally-raid aesthetic that looks even narrower and more focused. BMW has redesigned the fuel tank with plastic panels, resulting in a slimmer midsection. The entire silhouette looks leaner, and the motorcycle is now 14kg lighter than before. It appears someone has already kicked the indicator/brake light The bike is currently offered in two variants: Style Passion and Style GS Trophy. The Style Passion variant, which is the one tested here, features 20mm less suspension travel, a more accessible 835mm seat height, plastic handguards, a clear visor and misses out on a bash plate. For an additional Rs 25,000, you can opt for the Style GS Trophy variant, which offers 20mm more suspension travel, a taller 870mm seatheight, rugged metal handguards, a black tinted visor, and a slightly thicker, more comfortable seat. High quality and tactile switchgear make navigating the user interface a breeze While this motorcycle is specced out nicely, it misses out on the Enduro Pro Package available internationally. That would have included a 45mm fully adjustable Showa fork, a black handlebar with aluminium forged risers (20mm taller), and other enhancements that would’ve raised its off-road credentials. The new rally raid aesthetic looks more focused the F 850 GS Everything you see here is standard, except for the engine guard (Rs 40,000 extra). While the overall design is purposeful, the São Paulo Yellow paint may divide opinion. The headlight (same as the G 310 GS) could’ve been brighter, and the brake-light setup, which is integrated into the indicators, also looks like it could be a fall or an accidental snag away from a trip to the service centre. BMW F 900 GS position and comfort (7/10) Overall riding position is better suited for off-road riding The lower seat height of the Style Passion variant will help shorter riders, but this is still a tall bike. While the reach to the handlebar feels slightly stretched while seated, that same reach works well when you’re standing on the pegs. Seat padding and comfort could have been better The tank is now narrower, the seat more rally-style, and the overall ergonomics are off-road-biased. While standing on the pegs feels natural and confident, long-distance comfort is compromised. Another thing worth mentioning is that while the seat height is lower, the seat padding is also thinner, which eventually results in saddle soreness. It isn’t very pillion-friendly either. The advantage of this firm seat is that standing up from it feels a lot easier, but it will come at the cost of long-distance comfort. If height isn’t a concern, pay the extra money and get the GS Trophy variant instead Range is another limitation. The new tank holds 14.5 litres – half a litre less than before. Compared to the F 900 GS Adventure’s 23-litre tank, the standard F 900 GS will likely cover under 300km on a full tank. The lack of grab rails and mounting points also hurt its touring credentials. BMW does offer panniers and luggage racks, but these are optional extras that could set you back over a lakh. BMW F 900 GS performance and refinement (9/10) It has more performance and better refinement than the model it replaces Under the skin, BMW has worked on the old 853cc motor, bumping displacement to 895cc. It now makes 10hp and 1Nm more than before. Fire it up, and the engine has a bit more character, thanks in part to the standard Akrapovič can. Akrapovic exhaust looks great but not much louder than stock On the move, the bike feels livelier across the rev range. The broader torque spread allows for easy chugging in higher gears and confident overtakes. There’s no explosive top end, but the mid-range is very strong, perfect for trails and highway cruising. The F900 GS's motor is pretty refined at triple digit cruising speeds Despite its upright stance, the F 900 GS is deceptively quick and will get into high triple-digit territory with ease. Above 160kph, the blocky Metzeler Karoo 4 tyres become the limiting factor. City commutes don’t reveal much heat despite the season, and it shouldn’t be a problem in traffic. Punchy motor and well calibrated electronics ensure controlled slides Hit the dirt, and power delivery is strong but predictable, with plenty of bottom-end grunt to crawl up rocky climbs or make any overtakes on highways. The off-road traction control system also works well, enabling plenty of slide, but not too much. The six-speed gearbox is slick, but the bi-directional quickshifter requires a firmer foot, especially with standard road boots. It improves with off-road boots but lacks the smoothness of some rivals. BMW F 900 GS ride comfort and handling (8/10) It handles like a proper GS, with less bulk to manage There has been a complete overhaul in terms of the chassis, and the reduced weight, revised steering geometry, and shorter rear subframe make it feel more agile than the 850 GS. It still retains that familiar, planted GS feel, but now with more willingness to play. Despite the knobby tyres the F 900 GS handles rather well At 226kg, it’s not light by enduro standards, but its weight is so well-balanced that it never feels intimidating. The suspension has a soft baseline tune but can feel firm over sharp bumps. Meanwhile, there’s not much you can do about the front on the Style variant as rebound and preload adjustability can only be tweaked at the rear. The F900 GS feels right at home off-road The GS Trophy variant gets an additional 20mm of travel and would be a better pick for serious trail work. Even in this spec, though, the F 900 GS manages light to moderate trails quite well, and it’s predictable and easy to handle on loose surfaces. While there is a lack of feedback, the F 900 GS is quite eager to fall into corners Enduro Pro mode is the only fully customisable mode, and, even with traction control on, it rarely cuts in unnecessarily. ABS, however, cannot be fully switched off at the front, and there were a few instances of it intervening unexpectedly. Early signs of wear are a bit concerning On the road, the bike feels surprisingly light and easy to filter through traffic. Around corners, the chassis feels composed, but the Karoo 4s start to show their dual-purpose nature. These tyres work well off-road but wear quickly, with significant wear already visible with less than 3,000km on the odo. BMW F 900 GS features and safety (8/10) The F900 GS has a whole host of electronic aids that can be fine tuned to suit your style It features a crisp and clear 6.5-inch TFT with an easy to read and use layout. Additionally, this TFF supports Bluetooth connectivity and other app based features. As standard, the F 900 GS gets four riding modes (Rain, Road, Enduro and Enduro Pro). The best TFT in its class with an excellent layout While the other modes cannot be tweaked, the Enduro Pro mode is the only one that allows you to fine tune its parameters. Additionally, this model also gets heated grips for India which should be handy in colder parts of our country. The F 900 GS also gets adjustable gearshift and brake levers to suit riders of different shapes and sizes.  BMW F 900 GS price and verdict (9/10) The F 900 GS significantly under cuts its closest rivals BMW hasn’t just added 50cc and changed the paint; it’s a proper evolution of the F 850 GS. With sharper handling, better ergonomics, and stronger mid-range performance, this is a much more focused machine than its predecessor. Even without the international-spec Showa fork or Enduro Pro pack, the Indian version remains a well-equipped and versatile ADV, especially for those who prefer trails to tarmac. Factor in BMW’s aggressive pricing, despite being a CBU, and this bike undercuts its key rival. If you prefer broken trails and dirt roads over well paved tarmac, the F 900 GS is one to consider If you were to throw in the extra Rs 25,000 to get the top variant and spec in some accessory extras, you’d still manage to undercut the Triumph Tiger 900 Rally Pro and the Ducati Desert X by a fair margin. If road touring is your goal, BMW has you covered with the F 900 GS Adventure. But if you’re after a lighter, more playful GS that still carries the badge’s spirit, the F 900 GS, particularly in GS Trophy trim, might just be your Goldilocks bike.

    "description": "Yamaha’s FZ family has been around long enough to earn the “old guard” tag in the 150cc space. It’s the motorcycle that brought muscle to the masses when it first launched and has since become a go-to for smooth, reliable everyday riding along with big-bike looks. Over the years, the bike has received numerous updates, and the latest one brings in some interesting new features. Enter the FZ-S Fi Hybrid, a variant that doesn’t promise earth-shattering performance, but what it does offer is more efficiency and a big step up in tech and features. The big question, though, is this: does the hybrid tech make a difference, or is it just a buzzword? Yamaha FZ-S Fi Hybrid design and features (8/10) Muscular design with added TFT, Bluetooth, and hybrid tech Visually, Yamaha has played it safe, and there are no major design changes apart from some new colours and refreshed indicators. This is still unmistakably an FZ, and it continues to have that muscular streetfighter stance that made it so popular in the first place. Build quality is mostly very good, which is typical of Yamaha. A noticeable gap between the seat and the tank However, what caught my attention was a noticeable gap between the seat and the tank that effectively gives you a peep at the cylinder head. This Fi Hybrid variant is also available in an exclusive shade of grey and blue. The new colours, a touch of blue on the engine case, new switchgear and a brand-new TFT are the only ways to differentiate it.  Feature-packed TFT with good legibility is a boon The new 4.2-inch full-colour TFT display is a big step up from the drab LCD units we’re used to in this segment. It’s crisp and well laid out and offers Bluetooth connectivity through Yamaha’s Y-Connect app. The features list includes turn-by-turn navigation, call/SMS alerts, phone battery status, last parking location, and even malfunction notifications. It’s more tech than most 150cc buyers expect, and that’s a good thing.  New switchgear is well-finished but isn’t too tactile The LED headlamp does a decent job with illumination and is reliable for any late-night commutes. While single-channel ABS is standard, Yamaha has even thrown in traction control, which, with this amount of power, feels about as necessary as a raincoat in a desert. You’d have to ride through an oil spill to get it to kick in, and while it is a nice thing to have, dual-channel ABS would have been a more valuable safety feature. Yamaha FZ-S Fi Hybrid position and comfort (9/10) It has a relaxed, upright seating position with a spacious, well-padded seat Swing a leg over, and you’ll find that Yamaha gives you a commanding yet relaxed posture, which is ideal for city commutes and short highway stints. The seat is flat, spacious and adequately padded for both the rider and the pillion. At 790mm, its height remains accessible for most riders, and the bike’s 138kg kerb weight means it’s easy to manoeuvre in tight traffic. Add to that a well-judged footpeg position, and what you get is a very accommodating rider’s triangle for daily riding, with a hint of sportiness thrown in. Yamaha FZ-S Fi Hybrid performance and refinement (8/10) Refined and smooth in the city, but performance feels more 125cc than 150cc The 149cc air-cooled SOHC engine makes 12.4hp and 13.3Nm; on paper, it’s the same as the regular FZ-S. But the big news here is the Smart Motor Generator (SMG), which supports the crankshaft by delivering assistance at low RPMs. This system is similar to what you’ll find in the likes of the TVS Jupiter, but it’s hard to feel the system at work in the Yamaha.  Our performance tests also show very similar figures to the older model, so it’s safe to assume that there are no real performance gains here. What has improved is the fuel efficiency, but how much of that is down to the hybrid tech and how much is thanks to the new start/stop system is unclear. What we can say for certain is that the start/stop system works well and is one of the best we’ve experienced so far. It restarts quickly and silently when you pull in the clutch, even if you accidentally stall the engine, which is a slick little party trick. Out on the road, the motor is quite refined and tractable, with barely any vibration even at higher revs. The power delivery is rather linear, and the motor will happily pick up from 30kph in 5th gear. The performance is decent till about 80kph, but anything beyond that feels strenuous. Overall, it feels closer to a quick 125cc bike than a 150cc or 160cc one, and while the FZ is effortless to ride, it certainly isn’t exciting.  Yamaha FZ-S Fi Hybrid ride comfort and handling (7/10) Well-balanced in the city, but its firm suspension compromises comfort over rough roads The chassis is unchanged, and that’s not a bad thing – mostly. The steering is light, the turning radius is tight, and the bike feels nicely balanced in the city. The suspension setup has a firm edge to it, which results in decent handling but comes as a compromise in city comfort. For a motorcycle whose engine has evolved in the direction of being a city commuter, the suspension should have become a bit softer as well. High-speed stability is decent, though this isn’t a bike that eggs you on to carve corners. Braking duties are handled by discs at both ends, and while the bite isn’t razor-sharp, it’s progressive and confidence-inspiring.  Yamaha FZ-S Fi Hybrid price and verdict (8/10) Tech-loaded, fuel-efficient commuter that feels overpriced for the performance it offers At Rs 1.45 lakh, the FZ-S Fi Hybrid costs about Rs 10,000 more than the standard FZ-S. While you get better efficiency and a TFT screen with Bluetooth, this bike is priced higher than the top versions of the Bajaj Pulsar N160 and TVS Apache RTR 160 4V. Those motorcycles offer vastly better performance, upside-down forks and dual-channel ABS. What Yamaha has created here is a good-looking city commuter that brings premium features and better fuel economy. But that comes at a steep price, and if you couldn’t care less about the TFT and don’t mind being your own stop/start system, you won’t be missing out by settling for a more affordable variant from the FZ line-up.  Also see: 2025 Royal Enfield Hunter 350 review: Meaningful changes",

    "description": "In the end, no matter how well a car is engineered or how smartly it is priced, it’s the market that passes the final judgement. The customer is the ultimate arbiter. And our market is littered with examples of good cars that should have done better. The Hyundai Exter, it seems, is quietly joining that list. Spending a few weeks with our long-term Exter has left me a little perplexed. It’s a well-rounded package in nearly every respect, yet it doesn’t sell in the numbers it should. In contrast, the Tata Punch, which the Exter beats in several key areas, outsells it by a healthy margin. In fact, it emerged as the bestselling car in the country for several months. Yes, the Punch has a more upright, squared-off stance that gives it a mini-Tata Harrier look, and there’s no denying its presence. The Exter, in contrast, is a bit more funk than brute, with split headlamps, a busy grille, and lots of design elements fighting for attention. But still, it’s far from unattractive. If anything, it’s distinct and modern and stands out in a sea of safe, conservative shapes. All-black interior makes cabin gloomy. But the real story of the Exter begins once you get inside. First impressions matter, and while the cabin is well-laid-out and logically arranged, the all-black interior, with its shiny surfaces and hard plastics, does rob it of a sense of airiness and premiumness. It’s not bad per se, just rather dull. Lighter cabin tones, even as an option, would go a long way in making the interior feel more inviting. That said, the build quality is solid, and there’s good attention to detail in terms of fit and finish. What I particularly appreciate is the smart use of space. Storage is generous, and the wireless charging pad is one of the best I’ve used – it snugly fits my large iPhone 16 Pro Max without fuss. There’s even a thoughtful slot to route the cable cleanly in case you’re not wireless charging. A bit of a disappointment, though, is the very ordinary audio system, which lacks the clarity or ‘punch’ of rivals like the Punch. Audio system delivers average sound quality. But where the Exter genuinely comes into its own is out on the road. This is a car that thrives in the city, and the more I drive it, the more I appreciate just how easy it is to live with. The 1.2-litre, 4-cylinder naturally aspirated petrol engine won’t win any drag races, but it’s smooth, refined and delivers its power in a linear, predictable manner. You don’t need to keep wringing it out to get moving briskly in traffic, and that’s exactly what you want in a city runabout. Our long termer comes equipped with an AMT (automated manual transmission), and while I’m usually a bit sceptical about these clutchless manuals, the Exter’s unit is surprisingly good. Sure, there’s still that tell-tale pause between gearshifts, especially at low speeds. But it’s smoother and less jerky than in other AMTs I’ve driven. Hyundai has clearly worked hard on the calibration here, and it shows. Most of the time, it just does its job quietly in the background – exactly what you want from an urban automatic. AMT calibration is one of the best. The ride quality is another high point. There’s a certain tautness to the way the Exter goes over bumps – it doesn’t feel soft or wallowy like some of its rivals. In fact, there’s a bit of a ‘big car’ feel to the way it handles rough patches. And yet, it’s never uncomfortable. It soaks up potholes with a mature, composed feel, and that adds to your confidence when navigating Mumbai’s unpredictable roads. The steering also deserves a mention – it’s light, accurate and makes parking in tight spaces a breeze. But it doesn’t go numb at higher speeds either, which is encouraging when you do get the chance to stretch its legs. Speaking of which, I’m keen to take the Exter on a longer run. While it’s clearly built with urban use in mind, I suspect it might surprise me on the highway. Sure, you won’t be munching miles at triple-digit speeds in this, but with its decent ride comfort and a willing engine, it should do the job just fine. Well-thought-out cabin has good storage spaces. As I settle in for the next few weeks with the Exter, I’m genuinely looking forward to seeing how it fits into my daily life – and beyond. It’s already winning me over with its practicality, ease of use, and calm and composed character. And I can’t help but feel that more people need to give this car a second look. It may not shout for attention, but it quietly gets the job done – and sometimes, that’s exactly what makes a car a keeper.

    "title": "New BMW M5 review: lesser than its predecessor?",
    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/new-bmw-m5-review-lesser-than-its-predecessor-435696#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Car+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "A few months ago, we got a taste of the seventh-generation (G90) BMW M5 at the Buddh International Circuit. However, that was with a pace car; today is different. Very different. We have it all to ourselves at the CoASTT racetrack and out on public roads. So, it’s time for a full review and to get some answers to that weighty issue. You see, amidst stringent emissions regulations, the new M5 has managed to hold on to the V8 engine thanks to a plug-in hybrid setup. While the new M5 is a lot more powerful than its predecessor, it’s also far heavier. Oh, and it’s got all-wheel drive too. 2025 BMW M5 powertrain and performance Twin-turbo V8, plug-in hybrid setup BMW M5 specificationsFuel typePetrol-hybridEngine4395cc, twin-turbo V8 petrolPower585hp at 5600-6500rpmTorque750Nm at 1800-5400rpmBattery18.6kWhElectric motor power197hpElectric motor torque280NmCombined power727hpGearbox8-speed torque converter automaticTyres (front)285/40 R20Tyres (rear)295/35 R21Kerb weight2435kgGround clearance115mm It was clear that if the M5 had to continue with the 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 under the bonnet and still do its diligence to Mother Nature, it would need some form of electrification. Enter the plug-in hybrid, which provides a claimed 67km of all-electric range. It also gives the 585hp engine an additional 197hp from an 18.6kWh battery pack. The combined output stands at a healthy 727hp and 1,000Nm. V8, hybrid and AWD all add up to a lot of weight. Expectedly, with the motor’s instant response and the power of the mighty V8, the new M5 is rapid off the line. It simply shoots off and continues to pull well past hysterical speeds. 0-100kph in 3.5 seconds might be slower than the previous version, but 0-200kph in under 11 seconds is very quick. Opt for the M Driver’s Pack, and the top speed jumps from 250kph to 305kph. As soon as it gets a straight road, it’s as excited to unleash its 1,000Nm as a dog is on the beach. However, while the numbers are strong, the M5 has always been more about the experience behind the wheel. Yes, the acceleration is impressive, but the sensation of speed just isn’t there. It also gets a ‘Boost’ mode, which lends a push under acceleration. Still, the abundance of foam and leather cocoons you, and the hushed cabin feels unfazed by the blur on the outside. Sure, the exhaust sound that is piped in through the speakers adds some drama, but none of it feels raw or unhinged. 2025 BMW M5 ride comfort and handling Heavy kerb weight can be felt in the corners Get to the long and flowing corners of CoASTT, and the elephant in the room starts to make its presence felt. The 2.5-tonne kerb weight is too much to hide. Yes, BMW has done its best to keep the weight in the centre and low to the ground with the floor-mounted battery pack, but it’s not enough, especially when it comes to a change of direction. There is constant understeer, and despite getting the tyres up to temperature, they just scream in despair as the AWD system tries to find grip on every inch of tarmac.   No fun if you are into attacking corners. You can try and find the sweet spot by tinkering around in the drive mode settings menu, which is nothing short of a Pandora’s box. You can either get it way too wrong or hit the jackpot. Either way, it will take time. With settings that can be altered for throttle response, steering feedback, chassis setup, brake feedback and dampers – before you even get to the hybrid modes – it is far too overwhelming. You’d expect BMW to provide a ready-made car like the M340i, where it sticks to one basic character, and you can fine-tune a few settings to a limit. But with the M5, it’s to each his own. Vast setup needs a lot of trial and error. It can be an altogether different beast, depending on the buttons you press. In the event you do find the right setup, there are two red buttons tagged ‘M1’ and ‘M2’ that act as preset switches, so you don’t have to spend hours calibrating the setup again. However, if lap times aren’t your priority, there is the option to switch to 2WD, which sends power exclusively to the rear wheels for some sideways action and tyre smoke. Sure, it needs confidence to push the rear out on a 727hp rear-wheel-drive car, but, if done correctly, it makes for a fantastic Instagram post. Also worth praising are the carbon-ceramic brakes, which have the toughest job here – stopping this very quick woolly mammoth. The brake feel is natural, and the strong bite means you don’t need to worry about a tired ankle after a track day. It gets all the cutting-edge tech to master a racetrack but feels at home on highways. So, it’s clear that on a race track, the new M5 is not particularly fun. It is better suited for long highway straights. In Comfort, the suspension is tamer, too, and broken roads are dealt with impressively. There is body movement over highway undulations, but nothing that can be termed unsettling. The car remains flat at cruising speeds and is surprisingly comfortable. The steering can be set up for lightness, the gearbox for lenient shifting, and the throttle for a less aggressive approach. What further helps its daily manners is the plug-in hybrid system, with approximately 50km of real-world electric range on a full charge. It may not sound like a lot, but any saving of high-octane fuel is always welcome. Expect about 50km of all-electric driving range. Don’t think you’re missing out on the speed, though. Even in electric mode, the top speed is 140kph, so as long as there is charge, the M5-ness is there. At low city speeds, the one thing you need to be wary of is the speed bumps. With no ride height adjust, there isn’t much you can do to tackle some poorly constructed breakers, and you have to crab-crawl like a supercar. Still, it feels more at home and comfortable outside of a racetrack. You have the instant acceleration for quick gaps, the drama with the exhaust that will get all the metropolitan attention, and plenty of features to keep you busy while at a standstill. 2025 BMW M5 exterior design Less of a 'sleeper' than prior M5s In the past, the M5 has mastered the art of being a ‘sleeper car’ – an unassuming, discreet design that packs a surprise under the bonnet. But with each generation, the subtle approach has taken a back seat. Speed bumps need to be dealt with caution, but it is better than an i5. The new one shows off aggression with flared wheel arches, aggressive bumpers, and a matte black paint that is nonchalant yet gets enough second looks. 20-inch front wheels and 21-inch rear wheels further elevate the drama, and if nothing else, a simple exhaust upgrade will have people take notice. 2025 BMW M5 interior and features 14.9-inch infotainment system, 12.3-inch digital driver's display Inside, the M5 gets BMW’s minimalistic layout with a curved display. The 12.3-inch cluster and 14.9-inch touchscreen are crisp and responsive, but the minimalistic dashboard has resulted in a chaotic iDrive system. Everything from the HVAC to media and the drive modes are buried under menus and sub-menus, and while there are shortcuts and widgets, it just isn’t natural or intuitive. Funky dashboard with generous use of crystal and ambient lighting. Feels racy yet luxurious. The chunky steering wheel feels great to hold, and the seats are superbly accommodating – sporty but broad, with lots of adjustability and well-cushioned. Long drives are what this M5 yearns for. For all the cutting-edge tech underneath to help it out at the Nürburgring, it feels like it would be happiest on the Autobahn. Rear seat space is inevitably of lower priority, but despite being the standard wheelbase (unlike the long-wheelbase regular 5 Series), there is plenty of room on offer. Being chauffeured around in electric mode from Monday to Friday sounds like a good idea, so long as you are okay handing your chauffeur the keys to your 727hp supersedan. Don't look up to pray. No sunroof here. Boot space is impressive too, so that weekend escape to the farmhouse can definitely happen, and it will be rapid and comfortable. Just engage Comfort mode, amp up the 18-speaker Bowers and Wilkins system, and blast off. 2025 BMW M5 price and verdict Rivals the Porsche Panamera GTS and upcoming Mercedes-AMG E 63 At Rs 1.99 crore (ex-showroom, India), the M5 has some stiff competition. The closest of the lot is the Porsche Panamera GTS, which is also a four-door super-sedan with a V8 engine. The new Mercedes-AMG E 63 will soon set foot on our shores, but in the past, the competition was never a major threat to the M5. With this new one, though, things don’t seem as easy. The M5's competitors are much stronger this time round. It’s not as exciting as the last one when it comes to driving dynamics. Making some amends is the outstanding straight-line speed and the fact that it is a comfortable daily driver. If you’ve driven the previous F90 M5, the excitement is missing, and this one will not impress you as much. However, if you’re getting into one with no M5 baggage, the new-gen M5, with its V8 intact, will do enough to have you smiling.

    "description": "Honda has launched the 2025 XL750 Transalp at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom, Haryana). Its price remains unchanged compared to the outgoing model, but it receives a few new features. XL750 Transalp gets a new headlight; design same as the CB750 Hornet It gets revised suspension settings at both ends Honda XL750 Transalp: what’s new? For 2025, the XL750 gets a new windscreen and revised suspension settings For 2025, the Transalp’s fundamentals remain unchanged. It gets a new bi-led headlight setup, setting it apart from the outgoing model. It gets a redesigned windscreen with a new central duct that's supposed to improve airflow over the rider’s helmet. Honda has also made one crucial change to its suspension, with reduced damping at the front and a firmer shock at the rear. We had pointed this drawback out in our review and we look forward to experiencing this revised setup. The brand claims to have increased compression and rebound damping at both the front fork and rear shock. The XL750 Transalp also features an updated 5.0-inch TFT and four-way switchgear from the NX500. It features more customisation options compared to the outgoing model’s TFT. It also gets five riding modes (Sport, Standard, Rain, Gravel and User) that alters engine performance, engine braking and traction control. Apart from these changes, the 2025 XL750 Transalp remains unchanged from the outgoing model. It continues to be offered in two paint schemes – white and black – but they have been revised compared to the 2024 model. The XL750 Transalp continues to be powered by the same 755cc, parallel-twin, liquid-cooled engine that delivers 91.7hp and 75Nm. It's mated to a six-speed gearbox with a slip-and-assist clutch. The bi-directional quickshifter is a pricey optional extra. Priced at Rs 11 lakh, the 2025 XL750 Transalp’s price remains unchanged compared to the outgoing model. Booking has commenced with deliveries beginning from July.  Also see:  Updated Honda Transalp 750 to launch in India soon",
