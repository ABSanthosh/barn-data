    "description": "The attraction to automobiles does not always pertain entirely to a physical quality. Sure, a car’s design, or its smell, or its sound can be part of that attraction, but a bigger part lies within something more abstract. If there was ever anyone who could relate to such an emotion, it would be Rob Simon. His steed of choice has been, and always will be, the legendary BMW E30 M3. In the automotive space, the legendary Bavarian warrior needs no introduction or backstory. It has long been heralded as one of the most exceptional machines ever sculpted by mankind, offering a pure driving experience unmarred by unnecessary aids or features. Despite a near-death experience in his red E30 M3, Rob always lusted for another one. It wasn’t just the behind-the-wheel time he longed for but the deeper, unspoken connection it wove between him, his father, and his brother, all of which had E30 M30s of their own. That chance would thankfully arise once more, but not in the way he would expect. Tune in to the Petrolicious YouTube channel and relive Rob Simon’s BMW E30 M3 tale alongside us. Maybe bring some tissues along for the ride, too. Continue...",

    "description": "Gaydon goes very large indeed on both performance and 4x4 capability for its very first ultimate Defender On a rutted, unsealed gravel road about 200 miles north of Cape Town, South Africa, a very special new Land Rover - the Defender Octa - is doing its thing. It’s been doing it all day, to be honest - over rock, sand, mud and asphalt. But right now, it’s hitting a truly spectacular and unbelievably composed stride.There is very little besides us on this dead-straight, bumpy stretch that beams out towards a horizon wonderfully broad and invitingly mountain-spiked. Local speed limits on minor roads like these are are ‘surprisingly high’, say our guides; and, led by them, our convoy soon finds itself approaching UK motorway speeds - on surfaces on which you simply wouldn’t contemplate going nearly so quickly unless utterly confident that you were driving a very rare and particular kind of performance car.Here and now, we’re probably carrying 40-50% more speed than you would dare in most modern fast SUVs - Porsche Cayenne, Lamborghini Urus and even Mercedes-AMG G-Class included - for fear of being bounced off course, blowing a tyre or simply losing control and careering heaven knows where. But this Land Rover is very evidently made of different stuff, and its chassis is simply cutting through the dust, clawing at terra firma underneath and sucking up what punishment it finds, staying incredibly level and composed all the while.And so, alongside names and reputations like the Ariel Nomad and Ford Ranger Raptor, we must now rank the Defender Octa: a fast 4x4 that, it seems, can do absolutely everything and go everywhere that a regular Defender 110 can but an awful lot more quickly.",

    "description": "From full English to Continental, breakfast club car meets cater to all tastes I’m not sure if it was the Duke of Richmond’s people who coined the term ‘breakfast club’ for the famous enthusiast gatherings at the Goodwood Motor Circuit, but if it wasn’t, they were certainly the first to recognise and harness the power and popularity of these simple events. These days, they stage four breakfast clubs on Sunday mornings during the motorsport season, choosing different themes for entered cars (and motorbikes) and weaving the gatherings around their bigger events. You don’t pay to enter, although you do have to register (and thus provide your details). There’s good but pricey food and drink on offer, while a few stalls can sell you car-flavoured stuff. The demand has grown to the extent that keen entrants arrive before 7am and the organisers have taken to issuing instructions for spectators so that they will avoid getting in the way of the cars arriving for display. Inevitably, the success has spread widely. Other motorsport venues (such as Prescott hillclimb, near Cheltenham), car museums (such as the National Motor Museum at Beaulieu), car factories (such as Caterham Cars’ in Dartford) and even some big dealerships hold thriving breakfast clubs. In the season, there can be a dozen to choose from right across the country. As a serial Goodwood attendee, I can say with authority that the appeal of a breakfast club is powerful and enduring. For a start, you’re presented with a solid-gold reason for taking the trouble to fettle your pride and joy and then to drive it to a nice location. Once there, you get to hobnob with others with similar enthusiasms whom you might not otherwise meet and from whose experience you can always learn. Better still, this can be a family affair. Breakfast clubs usually only occupy a couple of hours, so family members can happily tag along for the ride knowing that they won’t get bored and they will arrive home with plenty of hours left in the day. And on site, you get to park somewhere photogenic that wouldn’t normally be available to you. Think the central arena at Beaulieu or the paddock at Shelsley Walsh hillclimb. Yet despite this brush with the rarefied atmosphere, you don’t have to do anything expensive or competitive, let alone bother with encumbrances like helmets or race suits. Lots of us enjoy the society of other owners but shun the competitive bit. It’s certainly easier on the car. Best of all, if your eye is on safeguarding the future of classic or specialist cars, you can proudly scan the ranks of people like yourself and cars like yours and know that, together, you constitute a lobby so powerful that the most rampant bunch of car-hating legislators would do well to take seriously.",

    "description": "The annals of music history are littered with bands whose third albums didn’t quite manage the success of their debut and sophomore offerings. That trend was at the forefront of Rick Hannah’s mind when he set out to build his third Kawasaki W650 desert sled. A South African ex-pat currently living in the UK, Rick works in the tech industry—but he’s a petrolhead at heart. Working under the cheeky nickname of Dirty Dick’s Motos, he burst onto our pages a few years ago with a picture-perfect Kawasaki W650 scrambler in the style of vintage British desert sleds. He followed it up with a similarly styled W650 a year later, leaving him with more than enough data to build a third. Rick’s biggest challenge was figuring out how to repeat his success, without getting carried away.…",

    "description": "Few cars boast brand equity as strong as the Hyundai Creta. This formidable midsize SUV has long dominated its segment, thanks to its well-rounded packaging, feature-rich appeal and diverse powertrain options. Now, Hyundai has taken the winning Creta formula and electrified it, giving rise to the Creta Electric. The big question is if this battery-powered version can replicate the success of its internal combustion engine (ICE) counterpart. The Creta Electric is built on the ICE platform, but it has undergone significant reworking to accommodate its electric powertrain. The cabin floor sits slightly higher to make room for the battery pack, the suspension has been stiffened to handle the additional weight, and the front wheels are powered by an electric motor. Despite these changes, the Creta Electric retains the dimensions of its ICE sibling, including an impressive 200mm (unladen) ground clearance. An \"electric\" badge on the bootlid and pixelated accents on the bumper set this version apart from its ICE counterpart.   Hyundai Creta Electric exterior In terms of design, the Creta Electric takes inspiration from the Creta N Line, particularly at the front. The enclosed grille, featuring a pixelated theme reminiscent of the Ioniq 5, incorporates a centrally placed charging port. This pixelated motif extends to the closed front air dam, which includes active flaps to enhance aerodynamic efficiency. The 17-inch aero-style alloy wheels further emphasise its EV identity, and they come wrapped in lowrolling resistance, EV-specific tyres. Adding to its aesthetic appeal are silver highlights on the lower edges of the black plastic cladding, creating a striking contrast. Our dual-tone test unit featured black pillars, a black roof, and a black rear spoiler for added flair. Unique identifiers, such as an \"electric\" badge on the bootlid and pixelated accents on the rear bumper, set this version apart from its ICE counterpart. The sight of its battery pack beneath its body looks a bit ungainly, especially when viewed from the sides. Flaps on the front air dam automatically open and close to improve aerodynamic efficiency.   Hyundai Creta Electric interior Step into the Creta Electric’s cabin, and you’ll immediately notice its resemblance to the ICE version. However, several EV-specific upgrades make it distinct. A notable addition is the all-new three-spoke steering wheel with a circular horn boss, adorned with four dots symbolising the letter ‘H’ in Morse code. Interestingly, the steering buttons have been rearranged – the infotainment and phone controls are now on the right, while ADAS functions are on the left. New three-spoke steering wheel with a circular horn boss; four dots symbolise the letter ‘H’ in Morse code. The familiar 10.25-inch instrument cluster now features an additional cube-like theme, akin to the Ioniq 5. The air conditioning console – borrowed from the updated Alcazar – combines infotainment shortcuts with touch-sensitive keys, although practical physical toggles for temperature and a volume knob remain. A standout addition is the steering column-mounted drive selector, reminiscent of the Ioniq 5. This design frees up the centre console, which now adopts a floating style. It houses a drive mode button, an electric parking brake, an auto-hold button, ventilated front seat controls, and dual cupholders. Impressively, there’s a lower deck area beneath it which houses a fair bit of storage space. Even the armrest console is huge, and like the glovebox, it features a cooling vent to keep beverages cool. Lower deck area beneath the centre console houses a fair bit of storage space. In line with Hyundai’s sustainable focus, the seats are upholstered in eco-friendly materials derived from corn extracts and recycled plastic bottles. Surprisingly, the texture is smooth and closely resembles the leatherette used in the ICE model. The slightly higher floor impacts the driving position, which feels elevated even at its lowest setting. While rear seat space remains unchanged and is comfortable, the seating postureis slightly knees-up. A new boss-function allows rear passengers to electronically slide the front passenger seat forward, enhancing legroom. Utility trays on the front seatbacks include grooves for mobile devices and integrated pop-open cupholders for added convenience. You're seated in a slightly knees-up position, although it isn't uncomfortable. Additionally, the Creta Electric features a V2L (Vehicle-to-Load) system with a 3-pin power socket, enabling users to power devices like laptops or small appliances. Storage capacity remains practical with the unchanged 433-litre boot, complete with a spare tire under the boot floor. A 22-litre frunk provides extra loading space beneath the bonnet. 433-litre boot remains just as practical as the ICE version; gets a spare tyre beneath the floor, too.   Hyundai Creta Electric features Besides carrying forward the ICE version’s feature-set, the Electric gets some new equipment too, like rain-sensing wipers, electric front seats with driver’s seat memory, a cooling central console, boss seat function as well as front seatback-mounted utility trays. It carries forward the Autonomous Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) suite, which, like in the standard Creta, adds a safety net without feeling too intrusive in its function. Familiar 10.25-inch instrument cluster gets new cube-like display theme. Hyundai has invested heavily in developing an in-car payments option, which, with a mere touch, facilitates a wallet-based payment for vehicle charging, as well as future subscription-based features. In addition, the company has developed a first-of-its-kind mobile application through which users can not only identify and navigate to over 10,000 EV chargers across different brands but also make payments via the app to certain service providers. This eliminates the hassle of downloading and registering on multiple brand-specific applications. We’re still sore that like the standard Creta, it misses out on things like wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, adjustable front armrest, a headrest for the middle rear passenger, and the volume of its 8-speaker Bose setup is much lower at the rear than in the front. Also, compared to the large screens of its competitors, the Creta Electric’s 10.25-inch touchscreen comes across as a bit small. A new boss-function allows rear passengers to electronically slide the front passenger seat forward, enhancing legroom.   Hyundai Creta Electric performance The Creta Electric is offered with two battery options: a 42kWh pack and a 51.4kWh Long Range pack. Both utilise Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) cell chemistry, similar to the Ioniq 5. This type of battery is more compact and energy-dense than Lithium Ferrous Phosphate (LFP) batteries, although LFP batteries are known for their longer lifespan. For added peace of mind, Hyundai offers an 8-year/1,60,000km warranty on the battery, alongside the standard 3-year warranty on the car. The sight of its battery pack from the side looks a bit ungainly. Powering the Creta Electric is a single motor on the front axle that drives the front wheels. In the Long Range variant, this motor produces 171hp and 255Nm. Interestingly, its torque matches the diesel variant's 250Nm and is close to the turbo-petrol's 260Nm. However, being an EV, the power delivery is strong yet exceptionally linear. Acceleration feels brisk and effortless, even in its most efficient ‘Eco’ mode. The three drive modes – Eco, Normal and Sports – deliver noticeably different responses to part-throttle inputs, while flooring the accelerator unleashes the motor’s full potential. A synthesised bassy hum under hard acceleration adds a touch of drama to the otherwise silent drive. In our tests, the Creta Electric managed a 0-100kph time of 8.2 seconds, slightly behind the claimed 7.9 seconds. Flat out, it can achieve a top speed of 180kph. Acceleration feels brisk and effortless, but real-world range of over 400km impresses. The Creta gets a total of five regenerative braking options, with Level 1, 2 and 3 adjusting deceleration and bringing the car to a crawl.While these modes are mild, Levels 4 and 5 are strong. Drivers can also disable regenerative braking entirely for a free-rolling experience or opt for the ‘i-Pedal’ mode, which allows one-pedal driving by bringing the car to a complete stop without using the brake pedal. Each mode feels distinct and natural, making them intuitive to use. Adaptive cruise control integrates seamlessly with the regen system, adjusting braking automatically based on the situation, though drivers can override this using steering-mounted paddle shifters. Hyundai Creta Electric range and charging The 42kWh battery variant has an ARAI-certified range of 390km, while the 51.4kWh Long Range version offers 473km. In a mixed driving cycle of city and highway conditions, our preliminary test of the Long Range variant returned an impressive real-world range of approximately 426km. For reference, our 289.6km drive at an average speed of 41kph toggling through different drive and regenerative braking settings, utilised 68 percent of the charge. Charging port behind the enclosed front grille gets an LED indicator. Hyundai claims the battery can be charged from 10 to 80 percent in just 58 minutes using a 50kW DC fast charger. With a 11kW AC charger, the larger battery charges fully (10 to 100 percent) in 4 hours and 50 minutes, while the smaller battery completes this in 4 hours. Hyundai Creta Electric ride and handling To support the additional weight of the battery and motor, the Creta Electric’s suspension is stiffer than the ICE version’s. Remarkably, it doesn’t translate into a crashy or uncomfortable ride experience. Yes, you can feel its firmness at low speeds, and you’ll also hear its suspension ‘thwack’ over sharp bumps (particularly due to an otherwise silent cabin), but road shocks are still well in check. What’s nice is that the stiffness has eliminated unnecessary (secondary) body movements, and even at highway speeds, the Creta Electric doesn’t lose its poise. The steering, too, is noticeably heavier than the ICE version’s, and as a result, it warrants more effort at slow and parking speeds. But at no point does it feel excessive or cumbersome. And while it hasn’t resulted in more feel or feedback per se, the added weight only adds to the driver’s confidence, especially at high speeds or around a series of bends. Also nice is that the Creta Electric changes directions well, and with its weight being concentrated lower down, body roll seems to be far better controlled than the petrol-version. Notably, the Electric’s braking is so good, the transition from regenerative to frictional brakes feels extremely smooth and superbly calibrated, thus lending to a very natural brake pedal feel. Hyundai Creta Electric verdict The Creta Electric has its flaws – the ride is stiffer than the ICE version’s; the steering is a bit weighty; and finally, its floor is a bit raised, which results in a slightly knees-up position. But none of these are a dealbreaker. A standout addition is the steering column-mounted drive selector, akin to the Ioniq 5. The Electric version still retains the ICE’s brilliant packaging like its spacious cabin, ample practicality, and a decently sized boot – it gets a frontal loading area (frunk), too. Performance is smooth, linear and reasonably quick. But what’s even more impressive is its real-world range of over 400km, with reasonable charging times. And even though its suspension is firmer than the ICE Creta’s, it gets a newfound confidence in the ride and handling department. Typical to the Creta’s proposition, this electric iteration is feature-rich, too. At an expected price ranging between Rs 17 lakh and Rs 23 lakh, the Creta Electric comes across as a fantastic EV. Will it replicate the ICE's success? If first impressions are anything to go by, the Creta Electric seems to have what it takes to dominate the EV space.

The group is expected to shell out around $1 billion to launch its own independent range of cars, trucks and buses under the JSW brand. SAIC Tie-up At the same time Jindal added that its existing joint venture with MG Motor has a lot of potential for growth. “When it comes to JSW MG, we believe that we have just scratched the surface in this company. And I think the joint venture is a very powerful one and there is a huge opportunity in India. Today we are a marginal player in this space. We have 1.5 percent market share in this country and JSW will never be satisfied unless we are in the top 3 of any industry that we are in,” he said. He added that the JSW’s vision for JSW MG is to come into that top 3 while being number 1 in new energy vehicles. “There is a large opportunity and with JSW MG and JSW, we should be able to fulfill that opportunity and scale the overall business for the group and for our partners. We are not looking for an equity partner, but a technology partner to fulfil that,” Jindal added.

    "description": "Bucking the trend of rushing into SUVs, Tata Motors will launch its Avinya luxury electric brand with a Sportback and follow that up with an SUV. Speaking to Autocar India at Auto Expo 2025, Martin Uhlarik, head of Global Design at Tata Motors, said, “The Avinya concept we showcased two years ago is a manifesto, but it will be the first product to launch and will be a Sportback – a 5-door, very low and very dynamic.”  The description is similar to what the first concept was all about, and Uhlarik says the design of the Sportback \"is finished in the design department, and the car will arrive next year.\" Uhlarik also described it as a 'real brand builder,' indicating that the focus for Tata Motors is to grab eyeballs with its first product and set the tone and shape of its new luxury electric brand. While the car may sport a non-mainstream body style, our sources indicate that the company plans a production run of an appreciable 24,000 units per annum. Luxury SUV to follow  Following the Avinya Sportback will be an SUV based on the Avinya X concept shown at this year’s Auto Expo. Uhlarik described it as a ‘brand pillar’, possibly signifying its larger potential given its more traditional SUV body style. Our sources tell us that the SUV will sit near the top of the five currently planned Avinya models, with a 3-row version occupying the top step. All cars, including the Sportback and SUV, would be built on JLR’s EMA platform. Our sources tell us that beyond these three products, the company is also working on two more body styles: a smaller SUV around the 4.4-metre mark and a larger 4.9-metre luxury UV, similar to the Volvo EM90 MPV.
