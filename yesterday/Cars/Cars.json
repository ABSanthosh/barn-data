    "title": "Nissan-Honda merger would create new automotive powerhouse",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/business-corporate/nissan-honda-merger-would-create-new-automotive-powerhouse",
    "description": "Wide-reaching merger would create a company selling more than seven million cars per year The reported merger talks between Honda and Nissan could divide the Japanese car-making industry into two powerful entities. Neither Honda nor Nissan has confirmed plans for a merger, first reported on 17 December by the Japanese newspaper Nikkei. However, the pair agreed to work together on software and EVs in August. A merger would create an automotive force with sales of more than seven million cars annually, based on last year’s figures for both companies. That would have the new company vying for third place in the global automotive sales charts, along with Hyundai Group, which last year sold 7.3 million cars. Mitsubishi could also join the new company, according to Nikkei, adding another million sales and taking the combined entity closer to the Volkswagen Group. Japan is already home to the world's biggest car maker in Toyota, which sold 11.2 million cars last year. It also owns Daihatsu and has formed financial and technical alliances with Mazda, Subaru and Suzuki. A potential merger would come to the aid of Nissan, whose struggles this year forced it to announce plans for 9000 job costs and a cut in production capacity by a fifth. Nissan is facing many of the same problems that forced it into an alliance with Renault in 1999. The company’s operating profit dropped 90% in the six months to the end of September, dragging it perilously close to its first loss since Covid-hit 2020. Honda’s results were better in the same period, with operating profit down 15%, but the two companies are facing similar problems and together could pool resources to come up with solutions.  Probably the biggest concern weighing both Honda and Nissan is China, once a huge market for both but where buyers are now rapidly turning away from their largely ICE line-ups towards locally developed EVs and PHEVs.  Both companies are rapidly trying to develop their own plug-in models to cater more for Chinese tastes, but they're both saddled with too many factories building too few cars in the country. Both Nissan and Honda are also deeply embedded in the US, and while they have assembly plants in the country, both face the same issue potential tariffs on vehicles imported from key plants in Mexico.  However, in the US, Honda has the upper hand in its range of hybrids – something Nissan lacks. Honda’s profits are still holding up in the US, whereas Nissan is being forced to discount amid buyer apathy. “Our core models are not selling as much as we expected, nor are they generating the profit that we expected,” Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida told investors earlier in December. Nissan is a far bigger force in Europe than Honda, but the region is small for both marques. Nissan might have the sales edge over the two, at just under 160,000 cars in the six-month period compared with 48,000 for Honda, but Nissan loses money in Europe. The region is still profitable for Honda, but its income fell 72% in the six-month period, even as revenue increased.  For both brands, their European presence is heavily weighted toward the UK, where the ZEV mandate has forced them to discount their very limited range of electric cars in a scramble to hit targets. Honda closed its Swindon plant in 2021, but Nissan still builds its key European models at Sunderland. Any merger between the two could open up Sunderland to Honda vehicles, giving production there a much-needed boost after falling away from its peak of more than 500,000 a decade ago. Nissan’s immediate problems would force concessions from Honda. “It would likely be premised on early restructuring at Nissan,” Kohei Takahashi, an analyst at the bank UBS, wrote in a note. “Rapid cost cuts would need to be implemented quickly prior to integration.” Other problems remain. “Two very different corporate cultures to bring together, and this will be a huge hurdle,” former Nissan executive Andy Palmer wrote on X. Nissan’s share price is low enough that merger at current share prices for both companies would give Honda shareholders 84% of the new company, the bank Jefferies has calculated.  That has implications for Renault, whose 36% stake in Nissan would translate to 5.8% stake in a possible new company. Renault is open to a possible merger, Bloomberg reported on 18 December, citing sources who said that the French company would be interested in any outcome that strengthened the future of its alliance partner and bolster the value of its shares.  Also reported to be throwing its hat into the ring is Foxconn, the Taiwanese contract manufacturer that is most famous for building the iPhone but keen to enter the automotive space. Foxconn is seeking to take a controlling stake in Nissan, Japan's NHK newspaper reported. Honda has been independent since its foundation in 1948. However, despite the rivalries between local brands, Japan has traditionally nurtured its own industry as it successfully grew globally. It could be that Honda will see saving Nissan as its patriotic duty.",

    "description": "The 1930s proved to be a golden era for V-twin-powered American motorcycles, and if you’re fortunate enough to own one, you’re sitting on a substantial pile of dough. Harley-Davidson’s 1936 EL Knucklehead is regarded by many as the single most desirable classic HD and the right Indian Four will net over $200,000 these days. But that’s relative chump change compared to a little-known marque named Crocker, as one of these precious V-Twins can be worth a half-million to the full seven figures. Founded in 1901 and 1903 respectively, Indian and Harley-Davidson enjoyed tenured dominance over any would-be newcomers to the American market. Still, Albert Crocker took the opportunity to learn from both marques.

    "description": "Few motorcycles can claim the notoriety of the ill-fated Buell Blast. Propelled by half a Sportster engine and aimed at beginner riders, the Blast was such a disappointment that its creator, Erik Buell, signaled the end of its production by publicly tossing one into a crusher. Then, to drive the point home, he offered a limited run of crushed and autographed Buell Blast ‘cubes’ for sale. The Buell Blast’s infamy—and rarity—are precisely what tempted Toshiyuki ‘Cheetah’ Osawa to customize it. Based in Tokyo, Japan, Osawa-san is the brains behind the ‘Have Fun’ flat track racing event. He also builds some of the most imaginative flat trackers around. The Blast is hard to find in Japan, so Cheetah imported one from the USA earlier this year.…",

    "description": "I love using my Suzuki Access to bop around the city. It’s comfortable, practical, frugal and zippy. So much so that I haven’t ever found myself wanting another commuter. That was until the Ather Rizta entered our long-term fleet. Ever since it arrived, my Access hasn’t seen much action, and in the month that I’ve spent with the Rizta, I’ve covered more than 500km. Two things that have made a positive impression on me in these early days are its enormous boot and intuitive regenerative braking. Its 34-litre boot is deep enough to fit in a lot of stuff, along with the big charger. The 34-litre boot here isn’t the biggest in the e-scooter game, but it’s almost double the size of the one on my Access (and most other ICE scooters). I’ve managed to fit in my fully packed Kriega sling bag and the bulky charger supplied with the Rizta, with room to spare. This is also the only e-scooter (besides the River Indie) that can accommodate an ECE-certified full-face helmet, which I think deserves praise. Unlocking the boot always needs two hands, which is frustrating on a daily basis. The trouble is that when I need to open the boot, it doesn’t unlock with just the twist of the key. I need to press down on the seat exactly where the locking mechanism is located with the key in the unlock position to get it to release every single time. This isn’t a big negative, but it is one of those things that gets mildly irritating with time. Another positive here is Ather’s Magic Twist feature, wherein the regen progressively slows you down when you twist the throttle backwards. This has proved to be quite a treat in Mumbai’s typically staccato traffic. At speeds below 40kph, with a bit of planning, I didn’t have to use the brakes and relied solely on the regen to stop.   Ather’s Magic Twist is intuitive and works beautifully well in city traffic. But there is a problem here. Locking the rear wheel up is all too easy when you’re coming to a halt hurriedly. Part of that blame must be attributed to Mumbai’s atrociously slippery concrete roads, but Magic Twist and the rear brake working in tandem seem to enhance this tendency. This has forced me to actively pay attention to how much pressure I apply on the brake lever. Either that, or I avoid using the regenerative braking when coming to a halt quickly, using only the brakes. Barring these irritants, it has been smooth sailing with the Rizta, and I’m looking forward to adding more digits to the odo reading. Strong regen, along with rear brake usage, can cause the rear wheel to lock up easily. Nevertheless, the biggest advantage of any EV has to be the beautifully low running cost. Per my usage, I spend around Rs 1,000 on fuel every month with my Access, but using the Rizta, that number drops to roughly just Rs 120! Also See: TVS iQube S long-term review, 2,200km report",

    "description": "The Q7 was the Q that gave Audi India their big break. It established the brand and has since been a trusty badge if you want a big, luxury 7-seater SUV. However, competition has never been more cut-throat, so the Q7 has received another makeover to keep it relevant. Audi Q7 exterior and design It still gets the recognisable face with the wide grille and sharp lines, but look closer and you will spot small vertical chrome elements on the grille giving it a bejeweled look, the Matrix LED headlamps are even more intricate, and the bumpers are sportier and feature ducts and faux metal panels. Over to the side, the wheels are upsized to 20 inches from the 19 inchers, but the silhouette and lines are the same. Dimensionally, too, there is no change. So, the 3,000mm wheelbase and 5-metre-plus length continue to offer a strong road presence. At the rear, the LED tail-lamps get new detailing and the bumpers are redesigned. Trapezoidal exhaust tips complete the look and the Q7 continues to flaunt the serious, no-nonsense look. Audi Q7 interior, features and space Inside, there is a new dark, open-pore wood panel on the dashboard and door pads. Barring that though, you’d be lost trying to explain the new bits. However, while things may not be new, the quality levels are exceptional, and it's something we have always loved about the Q7. The dual-screen setup, with its click-based interface isn’t all too modern, but the resolution is crisp. We would have also liked wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Other modern amenities that one would expect in a luxury SUV like ventilated seats, wireless connectivity and ADAS are missing, too. The Q7 does get lane keep assist, but a full ADAS suite would have sweetened the deal. The front seats are hugely comfy and supportive. You can easily spend long hours in the driver's seat. Middle-row space is impressive even for passengers over six feet. The seats can also be adjusted for length, thereby adding more legroom or aiding more space for the third-row passengers. You get four-zone climate control with vents in the centre console and B-pillars, manual sunblinds, and a panoramic sunroof big enough to be enjoyed by rear-seat passengers without any compromise. The third row is best suited for children or short adults on short drives. But you do miss AC vents and it can get a bit stuffy. Best then to electronically flip down the third row and use it as a massive boot. Now, while space isn’t a concern, what might have some buyers alarmed is the spare wheel, or the lack thereof. You only get a puncture repair kit, and since the tyres are not run-flats, you need to be extra cautious. Audi Q7 engine, performance, gearbox Powering the Q7 is a lovely 3.0-litre, 340hp turbo-petrol V6 engine. Refinement is simply excellent and this Q7, despite being a big and heavy luxury SUV, is rapid! 0-100kph is a quick 5.6 seconds and there is also a raspy exhaust note as you get closer to the redline. Mated to the engine is an 8-speed automatic gearbox that shifts without a fuss. It is quick, has impressive kickdown times and is enjoyable to use. The engine thrums along at 100kph at just a shade over 1,500rpm and the Q7 can munch on the kilometres happily. Audi Q7 ride, comfort, handling While the engine and gearbox are the perfect partners, they are slightly pulled back by the suspension. The Q7 gets adaptive air suspension, but for the more balanced ‘Comfort’ mode, they have kept it on the softer side. As a result there is a fair amount of vertical movement inside the cabin over undulations. The car even nose-dives under braking. A cheat code to counter this is to use the drive modes, and more specifically, the Individual mode. In this mode, you can set the engine and gearbox to be at a relaxed setting that suits the highways, but switch the suspension setting to ‘Dynamic’ that tightens the setup. This ensures you have less pitching and the SUV's more sure-footed. Where the soft setup makes up though is over bad roads, where it absorbs the harsh shocks and thuds that make their way inside. Handling is nothing to boast of, but it's as you'd expect from a big luxury SUV like this. The quattro system ensures there is grip at all times, but there is so much mass moving at such a high speed, it will understeer if you push it. Audi Q7 price and verdict Prices for the updated Q7 start from Rs 88 lakh and this top-spec Technology trim is priced at Rs 97 lakh (ex-showroom, India). This variant goes up against the Mercedes-Benz GLE and the BMW X5, both of which have moved much ahead in terms of modernity. What will be of interest to buyers then, is the lower-spec model that makes for a good value proposition. The ride is comfy, the space and quality is top-level and the V6 is butter smooth. It's a comfy cruiser for those who want to be chauffeured around with little fuss. Also see:    Audi Q7 facelift launched at Rs 88.66 lakh Audi Q7 facelift video review",

    "description": "After we exclusively reported that the Ninja 1100SX would launch in our country this month, Kawasaki India has done just that. The new Ninja 1100SX is priced at Rs 13.49 lakh (ex-showroom, India) and is available only in its standard guise here.  The Ninja 1100SX is slightly less powerful than the Ninja 1000SX Longer 5th, 6th gears for improved highway cruising manners Deliveries begin in January 2025, bookings open for Rs 50,000 Kawasaki Ninja 1100SX price, changes over Ninja 1000SX Powering the Ninja 1100SX is a liquid-cooled, 1,099cc, inline-four mill making 136hp at 9,000rpm and 113Nm of torque at 7,600rpm. Compared to the Ninja 1000SX, that’s a decrease of 6hp but an increase of 2Nm. Kawasaki has lengthened the Ninja 1100SX’s 5th and 6th cogs for lower engine rpm while cruising out on the highway, which it says also yields better fuel efficiency.  The Ninja 1100SX’s chassis components are nearly identical to the Ninja 1000SX, with the only difference being a marginally larger rear disc brake – by 10mm. The electronics suite is carried forward, too, with power modes, riding modes, traction control, a bidirectional quick-shifter and cruise control.  The Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX was a popular model for the Japanese company in India, as it combined litre-class performance with all-day comfort and touring capabilities. For now, Kawasaki India hasn’t gotten the 1100SX’s up-spec SE version with Ohlins suspension and Brembo brakes to India, and only the standard variant is on offer.   The new Ninja 1100SX has no real direct rivals to speak of in our market, with the closest competition coming from Triumph’s road-biased Tiger 900 GT (Rs 13.95 lakh). It can be booked from all authorised Kawasaki dealerships for a token amount of Rs 50,000. Deliveries will begin in January 2025.  Also see: 2020 Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX review, test ride",

    "description": "Skoda has released the first exterior sketches of its facelifted Enyaq and Enyaq coupe EVs, which boast the brand’s new Modern Solid design language. As this design was previewed by the 2022 Skoda Vision 7S concept, the pre-facelift Enyaq, which was revealed in 2020, did not sport this new language. The ‘Enyaq’ was Skoda's first offering in the pure EV space and is one of Europe’s best-selling BEVs in 2024. Enyaq facelift shares design details with smaller Elroq EV Modern Solid design said to extend EV range Pre-facelift Enyaq to be brought to BMGE 2025 Skoda Enyaq facelift design Like newer Skodas such as the Elroq, the Enyaq gets the brand’s new lettermark logo (replacing the winged arrow logo), along with what the Czech brand calls a Tech-Deck face – it features a much thinner grille that the outgoing model, which melds with the DRLs. The headlight units are placed directly below the DRLs, and are framed by air intakes in the bumpers. Visible along the side skirts and rear bumper are silver panels, which will likely be replaced by black plastic in the form of cladding on the production-spec version. As with the outgoing Enyaq, the facelift will also be available in Coupe form. The teaser image shows a silhouette with sharp lines running across the body, along with a black roof. In fact, the overall design of the Enyaq Coupe seems to be a bit more sedan-like than SUV, but this is likely to change for the production model, along with the likes of the massive alloy wheels and the lack of door handles seen in the sketch. Other details visible include dark chrome accents, a sharp tear-off edge and signature C-shaped taillights. Skoda Enyaq India launch plans Skoda has confirmed that the Enyaq facelift, and its coupe-counterpart, will only make its debut later in 2025. While Skoda showcased the previous Enyaq iV at the 2024 Bharat Mobility Global Expo, the Czech brand is likely to bring the same model to next year’s event in January. An India launch of the pre-facelift Enyaq has been on the cards for a while now, and test mules have been spotted here as well. Spy shots had shown that the Enyaq on test was the top-spec 80x variant, which gets a 77kWh (net) battery with up to 513km of WLTP range, up to 125kW DC fast charging support, and a motor on each axle producing a combined 265hp. Skoda claims a 0-100kph time of 6.9 seconds for this version of the e-SUV. More details will be revealed at the BMGE 2025 so stay tuned.
