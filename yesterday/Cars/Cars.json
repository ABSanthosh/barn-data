    "description": "When you’re late to the game, the best way to make an entry is with innovation. That’s exactly what Alpinestars did when they got into the motorcycle helmet market with the SM10 about six years ago. Having recently moved to this helmet after retiring my Leat GPX 5.5 (another innovative product), there’s a lot of out-of-the-box thinking that I’ve appreciated. The M10's snap-fit peak mechanism is convenient. For starters, I love the way the peak fit flush with the shell. The safety advantage is that the smooth interface leaves no edges or fasteners to catch on the ground in the fall, but the big benefit to me is the unique snap-fit fastening mechanism. There are no screws involved, and you can just pull the peak off or snap it back into place, which is a huge convenience if you regularly travel with the helmet. The downside of this design is that the peak position is not adjustable. The M10's liner has speaker cutouts. Other nice touches include speaker pockets and a three-way adjustable headband that can slightly adjust the angle at which the helmet sits on your head. There are grooves in the inner EPS liner for you to neatly route a drinks tube from a hydration bladder. Astars has also extended the EPS liner down below the cutout of the outer shell in the collarbone area. This is to reduce the chance of common injuries when the helmet hits the collarbone in a crash. Like many off-road helmets, this one also uses a variation of the MIPS (Multi-Directional Impact Protection System) technology. This enables a small amount of rotational slip between the outer shell and the inner liner, which is supposed to reduce the chances of concussion and other brain/neck injuries. The shell is constructed in a tri-composite material that uses carbon fibre, carbon composite and aramid fibres. Weighing in at 1,180gm, this would have been considered in the middle ground a few years ago, but it is now quite light with today’s stricter safety standards.   There are a huge number of vents all over the helmet (I counted 28!), and as you’d expect, the airflow is superb. The vision port is also very large, which means you should be able to fit a big pair of goggles without any issues. The comfort padding is fully removable and washable, and it uses an interesting fastening system, where you first align the buttons and then slide them into place. It works well once you figure it out. The M10's liner has exceptional ventilation. With a head circumference of 56.5cm, I’m in the no man’s land between sizes S and M. I went with the S that I usually use with other brands, but I find it a bit too tight. Astars has 5mm thinner accessory cheek pads that I’m keen to try, but I suspect it might have been smarter to go for the M size (which uses a larger shell) and then opt for the 5mm thicker accessory cheek pads if necessary. Just another reminder of why you must always try before you buy. Priced between USD 650 and USD 800, this helmet is on par with the competition from top rival brands. The M10 ships with a spare peak and a bag that’s spacious enough to hold a pair of goggles and even a jersey and pants set without the armour. While the helmet does feel very well-made, there is still a small margin to be gained in terms of ultimate quality and plushness when compared to something like an Arai. But in pure performance terms, this helmet is superb, and it can justify its price.

    "description": "The Lamborghini Temerario has been launched in India barely 9 months after its international debut at Monterey Car Week in August last year. Priced at Rs 6 crore before options, the Temerario is Lambo’s successor to the Huracan. 800hp V8 engine combined with 3 electric motors Temerario weighs 1,715kg (dry weight)  Interior similar to Revuelto Lamborghini Temerario engine, performance, specifications New V8 engine is claimed to be most powerful in a production car Lamborghini Temerario specificationsEngine4.0-litre twin-turbo V8Power800hp at 9000-9750rpmTorque730Nm at 4000-7000rpmElectric motors power150hp + 82hp + 82hpTotal maximum power920hpTotal maximum torque800NmGearbox8-speed dual-clutch auto0-100kph (claimed)2.7sTop speed (claimed)Over 340kph Unlike its predecessor, which came with a naturally aspirated 5.2-litre V10 engine, the Temerario is powered by a plug-in hybrid powertrain that combines a 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 engine with 3 electric motors. The turbo-petrol engine alone produces 800hp and 730Nm and has the turbochargers mounted between the two cylinder banks. Another highlight of this engine is that it revs all the way up to 10,000rpm; Lamborghini claims it is the most powerful and highest-revving V8 engine ever installed in a production car. Of the three electric motors, a 150hp, 300Nm unit is mounted in the 8-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox, while the other two – axle-mounted motors producing 82hp each – draw power from a 3.8kWh battery. The Temerario’s total system output is 920hp and 800Nm of torque. The brand claims a 0-100kph time of just 2.7 seconds and a top speed of over 340kph. The 3.8kWh battery can be charged via an AC charging port (up to 7kW in 30 minutes), through regenerative braking, or directly from the V8 engine. While the Temerario is an all-wheel drive model, it is the first Lamborghini to feature a drift mode. It also gets drive modes – Citta (FWD, fully electric), Strada, Sport and Corsa – and is equipped with 410mm aluminium disc brakes with 10-pot calipers on the front wheels and 390mm discs with four-pot calipers at the rear; Lambo claims a 100kph-0 stopping distance of 32 metres. Lamborghini Temerario exterior design, platform Alleggerita (‘lightened’) package brings weight down by 25kg  The Temerario uses an all-aluminium spaceframe that is said to improve torsional rigidity by 20 percent while keeping weight in check. Lambo’s junior supercar tips the scales at 1,715kg (dry), though a track-focused Alleggerita (‘lightened’) package brings that down to 1,690kg as it comes with a carbon fibre rear wing and wheels and a unique bumper treatment. It’s unlikely that the Temerario would be mistaken for anything other than a Lamborghini, as there are clear inspirations derived from its predecessors, the Huracan and Gallardo, along with new bits that are reminiscent of the Revuelto, specifically the hexagonal motifs. The Temerario has staggered 20- and 21-inch wheels with forged or carbon-fibre options, as well as numerous aero-based design elements, which are said to make the new supercar 103 percent more aero-efficient than the Huracan Evo, and 158 percent more when equipped with the Alleggerita pack. Lamborghini Temerario interior and features Interior takes inspiration from Revuelto On the inside, the Temerario is quite similar to the Revuelto, with Lamborghini’s typical fighter jet-themed cabin and plenty of hexagonal motifs. The interior features a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a central floating 8.4-inch touchscreen display and a slim 9.1-inch display for the front passenger. Lamborghini says comfort has been a big focus; 6ft 5inch drivers can wear a helmet and fit with ease, says the Italian marque. The 18-way power adjustable ‘comfort’ seats come with heating and ventilation, and there’s also onboard telemetry, a dashcam, and augmented reality navigation. Lamborghini says the Temerario also has more luggage-carrying capacity than the Huracan. Lamborghini Temerario rivals Temerario priced higher than Ferrari 296 GTB and McLaren Artura In India, the Lamborghini Temerario goes up against the Ferrari 296 GTB (Rs 5.4 crore) and McLaren Artura (Rs 5.1 crore). All prices, ex-showroom, India.

    "description": "BMW has unveiled an all-new generation of its sports tourer, the R 1300 RS. This model is essentially a faired version of the previously introduced R 1300 R, sharing many of its core components. It’s powered by the same boxer engine found in the R 1300 GS. BMW R 1300 RS features the same boxer engine as the R 1300 GS Runs on 17-inch wheels that are 1.4kg lighter At 245kg, the R 1300 RS is 8kg heavier compared to R 1300 GS BMW R 1300 RS revealed ahead of India launch A faired sports tourer from BMW with the same 1300cc boxer twin BMW has revealed the R 1300 RS, a sport tourer that replaces the R 1250 RS in its lineup. To simplify its position in the brand's lineup, the R 1300 RS plays a similar role to what the Ninja 1100SX does in Kawasaki’s range. It uses the same 1,300cc boxer engine found in the R 1300 GS. Here too, this mill produces the same 145hp at 7,750rpm and 149Nm at 6,500rpm. This horizontally opposed engine comes mated to a 6-speed gearbox with a bi-directional quickshifter as standard.  BMW R 1300 RS brakes and suspension  World's second series production bike to get adjustable spring rate in its USD fork This engine comes nestled within the same main-frame as the R 1300 GS, but borrows its rear subframe from the R 1300 R. Suspending this frame is a USD fork and a paralever EVO unit with preload and damping adjustment as standard.The R 1300 RS offers an adjustable spring rate in its USD fork, making it the second series production bike after the R 1300 R to feature this. Electronic suspension is available as an optional accessory. Braking is managed by twin discs at the front, paired with radially mounted 4-piston calipers, and a single disc at the rear. The R 1300 RS runs on 17-inch wheels at both ends but these new cast aluminium wheels reduce unsprung weight by 1.4kg. The rider’s perch is set at 790mm which can be further raised to 815mm.  The R 1300 RS features the same 17-liter fuel tank as the R 1300 R. However, at 245kg, it is 6kg heavier than its roadster sibling and 8kg heavier compared to the R 1300 GS. BMW R 1300 RS electronics suite Gets active cruise control with forward collision warning The BMW R 1300 RS comes equipped with a comprehensive set of electronic rider aids, including traction control, engine braking control, active cruise control with forward collision warning, and three standard riding modes: Eco, Rain, and Road. The optional Riding Package Pro unlocks additional Dynamic and Dynamic Pro modes. The R 1300 RS is available in four variants, each offering distinct color options– Basic version, Triple Black, Performance and Option 719 Cuyamaca. We expect BMW to launch the R 1300 RS in India in the coming months, and it will slot in between the R 1300 R (once it launches) and the R 1300 GS (Rs 21.20 lakh).

    "description": "Every custom motorcycle builder has a horror story (or many) about having to fix someone else’s mistakes. Sergio Almeida is no exception. When he got his hands on this Yamaha XT600, it was a far cry from the slick street tracker you’re looking at here. “The bike was already far from stock,” says Sergio, who operates as WKND Customs out of Porto, Portugal. “It had an upside-down fork swap, a set of supermoto wheels, and a mix of random parts, including a sportbike mudguard and a dual-headlight front fairing. It had already gone through a second engine, after blowing the first—clear signs of a rough past that showed throughout the bike.” Sergio had two mammoth tasks in front of him. First, he had to undo the work already done.…",

The Ducati Scrambler wasn’t the fastest bike on the track or gnarliest in the dirt, but it was fun, and in the age of Camelot, that was enough.

    "description": "Motoring industry's best up-and-coming female talent celebrated in ceremony at Horiba MIRA The winners of the 2025 Autocar Great Women: Rising Stars awards have been announced, recognising the motoring industry’s best up-and-coming female talent spanning nine categories. Held in conjunction with the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), Autocar’s Great Women awards celebrate the most successful rising stars across a wide cross-section of the industry, working for a huge variety of firms including BMW Group, JLR and Renault Group UK. There were 79 Rising Stars recognised across nine categories, with a winner emerging from each category. All Rising Stars were judged to be outstanding in their field and honoured today at Autocar's annual Great Women event, held this year at Horiba MIRA in Warwickshire. The Great Women: Rising Stars initiative also has an Apprentice category that recognises the most promising emerging talent from across the industry, with 32 impressive individuals named at this year’s event.  This year’s overall winner was Mollie Deacon, general manager of Citroën Burton for Vertu, who also claimed victory in the Sales category following a rapid rise through the business, having driven impressive results in electric vehicle sales, with her team achieving a 30% EV mix despite market hesitation. Among the category winners were Sophie Rowe, events manager, golf, at BMW UK; Loretta Dittrich, GME logistics director at JLR; and Abbie Harris, new product launch manager at Renault Group UK.  Autocar editor Mark Tisshaw said the standards this year were higher than ever: “This year, the exceptional quality of the submissions made the judging process both challenging and rewarding. I am confident that all the winners will continue to represent the best of our industry through their successful careers and personal growth. We are very eager to follow their future achievements.” Chair of the judging panel and managing director of Haymarket Automotive, Rachael Prasher, added: “My sincere congratulations to all the award recipients and the remarkable women we’ve recognised in 2025. The exceptional talent, wide-ranging expertise and deep-seated passion underpinning the automotive sector are truly inspiring. As we collectively steer through this period of significant industry transformation, such talent and varied perspectives are absolutely crucial.” SMMT CEO Mike Hawes said: “The Great Women awards shine a light on some of the extraordinary people driving the automotive industry, and this year’s candidates are nothing short of inspiring. Their achievements across such a diverse range of disciplines demonstrate the many rewarding careers and lifelong professional development opportunities the sector provides. Congratulations to all the winners – the industry’s rising stars who are already shaping its future success.” The event included a number of speakers, including talks and interviews from: Sarah Windrum, head of cluster development at Horiba MIRA; Volvo Car UK managing director Nicole Melillo Shaw; Diane Miller, director of the Parts Distribution Centre at Ellesmere Port for Stellantis; Lorraine Bishton, managing director of Subaru UK; and Renee Knott, head of project management and planning at Aston Martin.

    "description": "Chery will bring this electric 4x4 to the UK as the iCaur V23 The Chery-owned brand will be renamed iCaur outside of China to avoid a legal clash with Apple China car maker Chery will bring its electrified off-roader brand iCar to the UK next year as part of a global sales push. The brand will be renamed iCaur for models sold outside of China to avoid a clash with Apple, which owns the iCar name. The line-up will include the brand’s chunky V23 small electric SUV, launched in China last year. Top-end models use a four-wheel-drive setup (via twin electric motors) with a power output of 208bhp, drawing energy from a 82kWh NMC battery for 311 miles of range. The V23 will be followed at the end of next year by the 4.8m-long V25 SUV, which uses a range-extender EV drivetrain with a 1.5-litre turbo petrol engine.  In 2027, expect a small electric SUV dubbed V21 that will take on the Jeep Avenger. A large V29 is also planned for a later date, although UK sales haven’t been confirmed. iCar will open 2000 showrooms in 100 countries within three years as part of a wider Chery export push, CEO Su Jun said at the recent Shanghai motor show. Chery already sells cars in the UK through its Omoda and Jaecoo brands, which have grown rapidly since their launch last year to record a combined 6430 sales in the first three months of the year, ahead of Suzuki, Jeep and Fiat. The duo will soon be joined by a new Dacia-rivalling brand called Lepas. iCar was established in 2023 as a smart EV brand with a planned range of body types including a sports car and a people carrier, but it has since focused on chunky off-roaders.",
