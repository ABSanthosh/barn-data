    "description": "This 1959 BMW 507 is one of approximately 250 examples built during three years of production and was completed on October 6, 1958, before being delivered new on October 31, 1958, to Autohaus H. Bäte KG in Hannover, Germany. Chassis 70185 is said to have undergone a refurbishment circa 2012 that included a color change to its current shade of red before being acquired in 2022 by German specialists Arthur Bechtel Classic Motors, who performed a refresh that included a re-trim of its interior in beige leather. Power is provided by a 3,168cc V8 that features an aluminum block and cylinder heads and is topped by twin Zenith carburetors. Additional equipment includes an ivory-color hardtop, a four-speed manual transmission, 16” Rudge wheels, front disc brakes, a beige convertible top, and a Becker Mexico radio. This 507 was purchased from a collection by its current owner in January 2025 and is now offered on dealer consignment in St. Louis, Missouri, with photos from the refurbishment, a matching set of luggage, a scale model of the car, and a clean Montana title.",

    "description": "The world of motorcycle jackets is flooded with options that scream, “I ride; therefore, I must look like I’m about to scrape knees or win the Dakar Rally.” Enter Rynox’s Downtown Pro Jacket, which promises the right riding chops but prefers to whisper about them in a coffee shop rather than shout over an exhaust note. Available only in Midnight Black, it is rather muted and minimalistic for a riding jacket and is aimed at the urban commuter. The jacket’s touch and feel are quite premium for the price, and it still manages to be fairly practical. The fit is quite snug, and I found that the sizing chart was quite accurate. The chest panel is made of knitted polyester with infused reflective fibre that glimmers under light. There’s even a little reflective detailing that’s subtle by day and life-saving by night. While this appears a tad odd and out of place at the start, with time, I’ve begun to like its look. Pockets large enough to fit a regular size phone The jacket packs two large external pockets, usable enough to fit most things you’d need to access on the go. The shell is created using heavy-duty 3D polyester mesh and reinforced dual-stitching on slide zones. It is worth noting that while this jacket is mostly made out of mesh, the heavy-duty construction means it weighs more than a traditional mesh/textile jacket and has slightly less ventilation. Rynox also hasn’t disclosed any ratings for the abrasion resistance. Adjusters don't get in the way of folding your arm and it is easy to fine-tune the fit. In terms of comfort, the Downtown Pro does well in India’s harsh climate. The excessive use of mesh makes this a fairly breathable jacket for most seasons. While overall ventilation is quite good, it’s only during peak summer in Mumbai that I found it a bit lacking and not on par with the more affordable Cypher GT jacket. That seems like a fair trade-off to me, given the classy design. The knitted rib material used on the wrist and waist feels a lot nicer and should save you from any chafing. It is a soft and elastic material that ensures quite a snug fit. However, the downside is you won’t be able to wear a watch under your cuff, leaving it on display while riding. The front facing reflectors are integrated quite smartly into the jacket There’s also a removable internal rain liner, and the outer shell has some decent water resistance, so you can get through a short drizzle without looking like you walked out of a swimming pool. As for safety, this jacket is generously equipped with CE level 2 armour by Cerros. You get armour for your shoulders, elbows and back, along with an optional chest armour set that is sold separately. The armour is flexible, breathable, and sits flush with the body, so you don’t appear like you’re hiding a turtle shell underneath. At just Rs 5,950, the Rynox Downtown Pro punches above its weight. It is well-equipped and ventilated without breaking the bank. What’s impressive is how all this protection is integrated without ruining the silhouette. It’s very much a “ride to work, ride to dinner” kind of jacket. If your commutes are short and your evenings spontaneous, the Downtown Pro Jacket offers a presentable and perfectly comfortable option. However, if functionality and ventilation are your priority, I’d save the extra Rs 1,000 and check out the Cypher GT instead. Also see: Raida Frigate jacket review",

    "title": "TVS iQube 2.2 road test, review",
    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-reviews/tvs-iqube-2-2-road-test-review-435547#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Bike+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "The TVS iQube has routinely been among the top-selling electric scooters since its launch in 2020, and the very first one came with a 2.2kWh battery. Subsequently, TVS nixed that version and introduced newer variants with bigger batteries, but with ever-increasing inflation leading to larger price tags and a government subsidy that’s all but gone, TVS reintroduced the 2.2kWh option last year. It is now the new entry-level iQube and took over that role from the 3.4kWh variant. But is this 2.2kWh variant a genuinely usable scooter that retains the iQube’s strong points, or is it hamstrung in some way or another like most other budget-friendly e-scooters? After having ridden it extensively for a week, we have an answer. TVS iQube 2.2 design and features (8/10) Staid design and no groundbreaking features, but everything works wonderfully The iQube’s rather innocuous, boxy design hasn’t changed in the last five years, and if one passes you on the road, you’ll likely not give it a second look. All that notwithstanding, what is more pertinent here is that unlike other budget-friendly electric scooters, the iQube’s 2.2 variant doesn’t cheap out in terms of features or usability. It has a large 30-litre boot, a park assist function, a reasonably fast 650W charger, a handy brake-lock clasp, a colour TFT display, a 75kph top speed and even a front disc brake. Most of these features are also seen on the higher variants, so aside from the smaller battery and its lower range, from an end-user perspective, you don’t really get a lot less for your money. The standard 650W charger is quite compact and tops up the battery reasonably quickly. Addressing the boot for just a minute before we move on, the 30-litre unit is slightly smaller than the 32-litre unit on all the other variants. And while that’s still pretty spacious, it is rather shallow, so fitting tall items inside may prove to be a challenge. 30-litre boot on the 2.2 is slightly smaller than the other variants. It’s spacious enough but not very deep. There are a few areas where TVS can polish the iQube even further. For starters, it really should have a multi-function ignition key slot, just like the TVS Jupiter does. Opening the boot via its dedicated key slot is a more cumbersome process than it needs to be, especially if you’ve got your hands full with a bag of groceries or something of the sort. Another little irritant is that if you use the Park Assist function (which can take you both forward and backwards), once you’re done, the motor shuts off, and you again need to press the start button and the brake lever to switch it on once more. The iQube’s charger should also lock into place (like the Ather’s does), so no one can tamper with it when you’re charging it in an open area. And finally, you shouldn’t be forced to use the TVS app for something as simple as resetting the trip meter on the TFT display.  TFT display shows you all the relevant information, but some functions are needlessly complicated. TVS iQube 2.2 ride and handling (9/10) Plush suspension setup and comfortable ergos are hallmarks of the iQube Happily, all those niggles fade away into the background once you (swiftly and silently) get on the move. The iQube is one of the few scooters whose riding experience has always been uncluttered and very similar to a petrol scooter – aside from the pin-drop silence owing to its hub-mounted motor. At 110kg and with a low 770mm perch, this 2.2 variant is one of the lightest electric scooters on sale and is wonderfully manageable for smaller riders. At the same time, the riding position is spacious enough so that taller riders won’t feel cramped, and in general, the iQube’s rider triangle is spot on. Among EVs, the iQube’s riding experience is the closest to that of a petrol scooter. The seat is also generously roomy and can accommodate two full-size adults without a hitch. However, heavier riders will find that the seat’s padding is a little too soft, and they will start sinking into the hard seat base underneath after an hour or so of continuous riding. The seat is spacious but the padding is a little soft, which means heavier riders will sink in after a while. Considering its overarching role as a family scooter, the iQube has respectable handling capabilities, and it feels light on its feet in city traffic without seeming flighty at higher speeds. Credit must also go to its plush suspension setup, which keeps you comfortable and will shield you from all but the nastiest bumps Mumbai’s roads throw at you every so often. Braking performance is not lacking either because the iQube 2.2 is one of the only electric scooters at this end of the market to come with a front disc brake. While it doesn’t have hill-hold control like most other EVs do, the brake-lock clasp comes in handy, especially if you park your vehicle on a slope.  Brake-lock clasp is a handy feature, especially since the iQube doesn’t get hill-hold. TVS iQube 2.2 performance and efficiency (9/10) The range claim is extremely accurate, and it is very usable even in Eco mode With a 75kph top speed, this 2.2 variant is slightly slower in outright terms than the others, but never once did it feel like it was unusably slow in the situations we subjected it to. And unlike some other e-scooters where the Eco mode is quite dull, on the iQube, you can easily climb flyovers with a pillion and overtake traffic. Eco limits you to 47kph, and to go faster than that, you need to switch to Power mode, where you get zippier acceleration and can hit the scooter’s top speed. One of the iQube’s hallmarks is its plush suspension setup, which keeps you comfy on our roads. You can easily switch from Eco to Power while you’re on the move by using the dedicated mode switch, but if you want to go back to Eco, you need to slow down to 45kph or less. While initial acceleration from its hub-mounted motor isn’t as energetic as an Ather Rizta’s, the iQube is still a pretty zippy thing, and on most occasions, you’ll overtake everyone else who’s standing at the same signal as you. The motor is very quiet; outright performance is more than enough but initial acceleration lacks urgency. The iQube’s range indicator is ultra-reliable, a factor that greatly aids peace of mind on an EV, and what you see on the screen is how far you’ll actually go. In fact, in our tests, the iQube 2.2 covered 76.4km in Eco when TVS itself claims that the range is 75km. And the fact that you have a reasonably fast 650W charger means that topping up a flat battery to full takes a mere 3 hours and 24 minutes. This combination of a pretty quick charger and a small battery has proven to be a masterstroke, giving this iQube variant one of the quickest charging times in the industry. There are no compromises here, as you see in other EVs at a similar price. TVS iQube 2.2 price and verdict (9/10) The iQube 2.2 is a very compelling option among the affordable EVs currently sold in India Aside from some small UI issues that need ironing out, this Rs 1 lakh iQube 2.2 carries forward all the strong points of the other variants without exception. While it is an affordable machine, crucially, it doesn’t feel cheap. And knowing how reliable our previous TVS iQube S long-termer was, this one, too, should run without any hiccups every time you twist the key – come rain or sunshine. The iQube is one of few EVs at this price to get a front disc brake. Stopping force is decent, and it has CBS. This brings us to the question we posed about the iQube 2.2 at the start: does it feel hamstrung like some similarly priced electric scooters? As we are sure you can tell by now, the answer is an emphatic no. If you are someone whose daily running is under 50km and have secure charging at your home, then choosing this iQube really is a great way to save a lot of money.

    "description": "The premium electric vehicles (EV) space has really begun to heat up. While there weren’t any options between the Rs 25 lakh MG ZS EV and the Rs 1 crore Mercedes EQC earlier, now there are as many as six EVs priced around Rs 50 lakh on sale. Of these, the Hyundai Ioniq 5, the recently launched BYD Sealion 7 and the locally made BMW iX1 LWB appear to be the most compelling. We brought the three together and put them through our real-world tests to see which one deserves a spot in your garage. All three EVs measure over 4.6 metres in length, over 1.8 metres in width and have a 2.8-metre or longer wheelbase. The BYD is the longest and the widest, the BMW is the tallest, and the Hyundai trumps the other two in wheelbase length. As for their underpinnings, the BYD and Hyundai have born-electric platforms, which allow for better packaging and interior space. As such, these two feature a properly usable frunk (front trunk), which the ICE-to-EV converted BMW lacks.

The Ioniq 5 takes the shape of a large hatchback; the iX1 is more like a traditional SUV, while the Sealion 7 looks like a coupé-SUV. It really depends on which style you prefer, but all of them stand out in their own way with distinctive design elements. The Ioniq 5 has a neo-retro look with sharp cuts and creases and unique multi-spoke, dual-tone alloys, and I particularly like the rectangular lighting elements. In contrast, the Sealion 7 has a more rounded design that goes with BYD’s family look. It does look large and ungainly from the front, but the large alloys and the tapering roofline add some flair. At the rear, there’s a connected lighting element, which has some nice details. The BMW is the most conventional by far and has that upright stance of an SUV. It features BMW’s signature kidney grille, which appears a bit too large, as do the LED headlights. Its side profile does not look the most proportionate, thanks to the longer wheelbase and the smaller 18-inch wheels; the rear is quite similar to the standard X1, with large, L-shaped LED tail-lamps. BYD Sealion 7 vs Hyundai Ioniq 5 vs BMW iX1 LWB interior space and comfort The Sealion 7’s interior is superbly finished and loaded with tech, but the instrument cluster is cluttered. All three EVs have distinct identities inside the cabin as well. Starting with the Sealion 7, you’re greeted with a relatively conventional-looking dashboard, which houses the screens for the touchscreen infotainment system and the driver’s display. The 15.6-inch touchscreen, in typical BYD fashion, can change orientation from landscape to portrait, is very slick to operate, has high-res graphics, and even gets an updated UI over its siblings. This screen controls most of the car’s functions, but it’s nice that there are some physical controls in the centre console and a neat trick to adjust the AC without going into the sub-menus. All you have to do is swipe on the screen with three fingers from left to right for fan speed and from top to bottom for the temperature. Tinted glass at the back helps keep the Sealion 7 cool. The driver’s display, too, is high-res, but it appears very cluttered, and a lot of the important info appears small. But you have to commend BYD for the superb material quality and fit-and-finish, which feel on par with European luxury brands. The BYD's high-res 360-degree camera is one of the best. In the centre console, you get two wireless charging pads and two cup holders; there’s even some storage space below the console. The front seats feature ventilation, have just the right amount of cushioning and are very comfortable for occupants of all sizes. At the back, too, the seats feel plush and can be reclined; there’s loads of space, particularly legroom. The large windows and the glass roof elevate the sense of space. BYD’s 500-litre boot can fit in a lot. BYD has also packed the Sealion 7 with features like wireless smartphone integration, a 12-speaker Dynaudio music system, powered front seats, auto headlamps and wipers, a gesture-controlled and powered tailgate, dynamic ambient lighting, and much more. As for safety, there are 11 airbags, including one between the front seats and two for the rear side bolsters. There’s also Level 2 ADAS, a crisp 360-degree camera, and a driver-attention monitor, which is way too sensitive – even briefly glancing at the touchscreen generates a warning. The Sealion 7’s rear seat is big on space and feels the plushest. As for the new iX1 LWB, it has the same dash design as the ICE-powered X1 and the iX1 xDrive30, with a large, curved display that includes the infotainment touchscreen and the instrument panel. There are large, horizontal AC vents on the passenger side of the dash and under the screen, below which a sizeable wireless charging pad is located. The centre console extends from the centre armrest and houses some of the car’s key functions. The screens, while high in resolution, are too complicated tonavigate initially and on the go. While the fit and finish are great, some materials lower in the cabin are hard and scratchy. The steering is typically BMW with a chunky rim; the touchscreen has swallowed too many controls, and the UI is confusing. The front seats are supportive, but larger passengers may find them narrow, and they don’t have ventilation, which the other two EVs provide. The cushioning is firmer than the BYD’s. While the seats may not seem as comfortable initially, you’ll feel the cushioning is well-judged the longer you spend time in them. It’s at the rear where you get to experience the benefits of a long wheelbase. Though you are seated quite low and in a bit of a knees-up position because of the underfloor battery, you get acres of legroom; the seat base is longer by 15mm, and the backrest can be reclined up to 28.5 degrees, all of which make it more comfortable than the standard wheelbase version of the iX1. Compared to the BYD, though, the BMW feels narrower inside, and the backrest cushioning is on the firmer side. What also would’ve added to the comfort is rear sun blinds, which are also missing in the BYD. The iX1 has the most legroom but doesn’t get sunshades. The BMW is the least feature-rich EV here, but it still gets stuff like a large panoramic glass roof, ambient lighting, auto LED headlamps, connected tech, a smartphone-enabled key, leather upholstery, eight airbags and Level 2 ADAS tech. BMW’s 490-litre boot is the smallest here. Now, let’s come to the Hyundai Ioniq 5. Step inside it, and you get a great sense of space, thanks to the massive glass area, light colours, flat floor and the absence of a traditional centre console. Hyundai has used recycled and sustainable materials inside, and what’s great is that the fit and finish, as well as the touch and feel of bits, are top-notch. However, the white upholstery stains very easily, as you’d typically expect. The Hyundai's cabin is well-finished, logically laid out and big on practicality; UI is the easiest to use. Headlining the dash are two 12.3-inch screens – one for the instrument cluster and the other for the infotainment. These displays are crisp and easy to read, and the UI is easier to understand and navigate than that of the other two. The steering is a 2-spoke unit that houses a round drive-mode selector, while the drive-selector stalk is beneath the headlamp stalk. Uniquely, the entire centre console slides front and back to tailor the space and access. There are also plenty of storage spaces, such as a huge drawer in place of the glove box, large door bins and the centre console itself. The Ioniq 5's front seats are cooled, heated and get ottomans. The front seats are broad and supremely comfortable, with soft cushioning and plenty of electric adjustments, including extendable leg rests, and they can be configured into a comfy lounger. They also have ventilation and heating. The rear seats, though not as comfy as the ones in front, are easily wide enough for three adults, with the outer two seats featuring heating and electric adjustment. However, you are seated in a knees-up position due to the battery under the floor. The Hyundai's rear seats are wide enough for three, but you’re seated in a knees-up position. The Ioniq 5 also packs in a panoramic fixed glass roof, an 8-speaker Bose sound system, a 360-degree parking camera, dual-zone climate control, an electric boot, ESP, six airbags and ADAS. Wired smartphone integration is a downer, though.

The Sealion 7 has an all-wheel drive (there is also an RWD version), the Ioniq 5 is rear-wheel drive and, rather unconventionally, it’s the BMW that’s front-wheel drive. The BYD, in this dual-motor Performance guise, also has a clear advantage in terms of output (530hp/690Nm), followed by the Hyundai (217hp/350Nm) and the BMW (204hp/250Nm). And this is reflected in the performance figures. The Sealion 7 Performance makes the 0-100kph sprint in a brisk 4.43 seconds, compared to the Ioniq’s 7.48 seconds and the iX1’s 11.30 seconds. It’s the same story in rolling acceleration, with the BYD comfortably outperforming its rivals. Before we get into the nitty-gritty of how these feel like to drive, one thing each of them does admirably well is delivering power in a linear manner, unlike EVs of old, which served up all of their performance in one big chunk right from the get-go. All three also get drive modes, which affect throttle sensitivity, power delivery and range. Let’s start with the BYD, which easily feels the quickest of the lot. What’s nice is that it is able to put its power down in a tidy manner, thanks to the AWD system. On the move, you’ll also appreciate how smooth and progressive the power delivery is. And while the powertrain is silent, you will start to hear more of the outside world as you get closer to triple-digit speeds despite it featuring double-glazed front windows. Similarly, in the Hyundai, you don’t get that neck-snapping acceleration; the power delivery is nice and smooth. But that’s not to say that you’ll feel a lack of performance, as the Ioniq 5 feels sprightly in the Sport mode. The throttle modulation has also been judged very well, and it feels like a normal ICE car to drive. What’s also nice is that suspension, road and tyre noises barely disrupt the silence of the cabin. The BMW, by far, feels the most relaxed out of the trio, and while it packs over 200hp, given the weight it has to haul around, it can leave you wanting more, like when you want to make a quick overtake. As it has a front-wheel drive, there’s also some torque steer to contend with when driven flat out. As for sound insulation, it isn’t as quiet on the move as the Ioniq but fares better than the Sealion 7.

The Sealion 7 has an 82.56kWh unit with BYD’s blade cell LFP battery technology. The Ioniq 5 has the second-largest battery pack at 72.6kWh, and the BMW has the smallest at 66.4kWh; these two use the NMC battery chemistry. However, the Ioniq 5 has the highest claimed range of 631km, followed by the Sealion 7 (542km) and the iX1 (531km). In our real-world range test, the Ioniq 5 came out on top with a calculated overall range of 457km, significantly higher than the other two. The iX1 LWB had a 398km range, and given the extra power, the BYD delivered the least range of 371km. And, as is the case with most EVs, all three were more efficient in the city cycle, where they can recuperate more energy.  The move to the long wheelbase has come at the cost of some agility. All three get multiple regen braking modes, but the BMW has an advantage here with four modes; the Hyundai gets three, while the BYD has only two. One must note that the BMW also has an adaptive regen mode, but it’s not very intuitive, and the Hyundai is the only one in which you can turn off regen, allowing for free coasting. However, the BMW’s mode controls are baked into the touchscreen, making it tedious to change them on the move, and it’s also the most aggressive of the lot. On the other hand, the BYD feels the least aggressive, even in its ‘High’ mode. It’s the Hyundai’s regen that is best tuned, with a natural feel in the lower level, and you can even adjust levels or turn it off via paddle shifters. Also, the iX1 and the Ioniq 5 are capable of one-pedal driving. Despite huge 20-inch alloys, the ride is supple. The Ioniq 5 is the clear winner when it comes to charging speeds, as it is capable of DC fast charging at speeds of up to 350kW, which is enough to take it from 10 to 80 percent in just 18 minutes. The BYD can be charged up to 150kW on a DC fast charger. Both these are also capable of V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) and V2L (vehicle-to-load) functions, wherein they can charge other EVs and power/charge other devices. The BMW can be fast-charged up to 130kW. BYD Sealion 7 vs Hyundai Ioniq 5 vs BMW iX1 LWB ride comfort and handling As for ride and handling, the Sealion 7 has a hint of firmness to its ride, but it manages to deal with road imperfections fairly well. The 20-inch wheels on this AWD version are a fly in the ointment, making it feel crashy over bumps. Given its mass and high centre of gravity, the BYD rolls a fair bit around bends, and its steering feels a little too quick. Smaller 18-inch wheels help give it a cushy ride. The Ioniq 5 feels planted at all speeds, and you’ll like the maturity with which it drives. The steering is direct and has a good heft, but it doesn’t feel sporty to drive, which is fine given its focus on comfort. And despite sitting on those large 20-inch alloys, the ride feels comfy and well-damped, and the Ioniq 5 deals with the rough stuff fairly well. There are some minor vertical movements over expansion joints, but it feels well-controlled. Meanwhile, the long wheelbase has affected the BMW iX1’s handling just as you’d expect. It doesn’t feel as agile as the regular wheelbase, dual-motor iX1 xDrive30, but it still grips corners admirably well with little body roll to speak of. The ride quality, like in most BMWs lately, is excellent. It feels very absorbent and does a good job of making the iX1 feel composed over most surfaces. BYD Sealion 7 vs Hyundai Ioniq 5 vs BMW iX1 LWB price and verdict The iX1, which has BMW’s badge value to bank on, has plenty of space at the back and is very attractively priced at Rs 49 lakh; dynamically, it’s the best here. But it has its shortcomings – it isn’t as equipped as the others; the infotainment system is unnecessarily complex and has swallowed a lot of key functions; the rear-seat backrest cushioning is firm, and certain plastics lower in the cabin feel out of place on a BMW. Now let’s sum up the Sealion 7. It is BYD’s most rounded offering in India yet and has everything we love about the Seal sedan in a more practical package. The interior quality and fit-and-finish are top-notch; it’s got all the tech and features you need, a comfortable backseat, and the most powerful drivetrain that’s quite smooth. It’s also the only one here with all-wheel drive (Rs 54.90 lakh), though there’s an RWD version with a higher claimed range of 567km but a lower output (310hp, 380Nm) and a price tag of Rs 48.90 lakh, which is still more expensive than the Hyundai and with a lower promised range. The Sealion 7 loses ground in its real-world range, which is the lowest, and it isn’t as well-rounded in many specific matters – the sound levels inside the cabin are high, the ride isn’t as plush, and the driver’s display is cluttered. And then, there’s BYD’s relative lack of an aftersales network. And this brings us to the winner, the Hyundai Ioniq 5. It standsout as the most approachable and well-rounded package. The cabin is spacious, the seats are very comfy and unique, and the infotainment is easy to navigate. The Ioniq 5 is also the most natural to drive, has the best real-world range and can charge at the fastest pace. To top it off, it’s the most affordable, too, at Rs 46 lakh. It’s no wonder then that the Ioniq 5 won our Car of the Year 2024 award and this comparison, too.

    "description": "Updated performance model can outdrag an Aston Martin DB12, and packs a new drift mode The new Bentley Bentayga Speed has been unwrapped as the brand’s quickest SUV yet, beating its predecessor to 62mph by half a second and going on to 193mph. It swaps the previous Bentayga Speed’s 6.0-litre W12, now retired, for a twinturbocharged 4.0-litre V8 that puts out 641bhp and 627lb ft – a gain of 15bhp and a loss of only 37lb ft. The smaller powerplant also plays a significant role in cutting the Speed’s kerb weight by 42kg to 2466kg. Helped along by a new launch control function, the super-SUV is now capable of completing the 0-62mph dash in 3.4sec, beating the 3.9sec and 4.5sec sprint times of the old Speed and the V8-engined S. The extra power also boosts the Bentayga’s top speed by 3mph. In addition to its enhanced pace, the Speed gets reworked drive modes, including a Sport mode that increases the dampers’ stiffness by 15% and slackens off the stability control to “permit exhilarating drift angles”. Meanwhile, rear-wheel steering aids manoeuvrability at lower speeds and boosts stability when pressing on. A sports exhaust system is fitted as standard, but there is an optional Akrapovic-supplied titanium system with four tailpipes, said to unleash the “drama and potency” of the new powerplant. The new super-Bentayga is differentiated visually from other variants by the Speed badges on its fl anks, as well as a choice of bespoke 22in or 23in wheel designs.  The larger of those two is offered as an optional extra with the addition of carbon-ceramic discs. Inside, the Speed gets a different layout on its digital instrument screen, as well as Speed badging on the passenger side of the dashboard and the treadplates, plus matching embroidery on the seats. Prices start at £219,000, positioning the Speed between the S (£201,500) and the more opulent Mulliner EWB (£259,300).  Its closest rivals include the V8 Range Rover Sport SV (£169k), the V8 plug-in hybrid Lamborghini Urus SE (£208k) and Aston Martin’s V8 DBX S (£210k).",

    "description": "Steve Catlin, currently head of Volvo Car Financial Services UK, returns to Stellantis's British brand Welcome to Movers and Shakers, an Autocar Business feature covering the latest job moves from across the automotive industry. This page is updated regularly with all the biggest transfers, promotions and departures in the sector, covering everything you need to know. Name: Steve Catlin Company: Vauxhall Role: Managing director Vauxhall has named Steve Catlin its new managing director, following James Taylor's exit in February.  Catlin will be charged with overseeing the launches of crucial new models such as the Frontera crossover (in both hybrid and electric forms) and the electric-only relaunch of the GSe performance sub-brand. He joins Vauxhall from Volvo Car Financial Services UK, where he was also MD. The appointment marks his return to the British brand: he started his career at Vauxhall more than 20 years ago and gradually rose to become its retail sales director, before leaving in 2015. “Steve brings deep experience across the industry and a strong understanding of Vauxhall’s role in shaping the future of British mobility,\" said Eurig Druce, MD of Vauxhall parent firm Stellantis UK.  \"Vauxhall, a home brand for Stellantis UK, must return to growth, and I am confident Steve will lead the teams in a positive trajectory.\"  Name: Davide Sfrecola Company: Lamborghini Role: Head of UK Lamborghini has appointed former Japan boss Davide Sfrecola as the new head of its UK arm, as it negotiates a crucial year for the brand. Having already replaced the Aventador with the Revuelto and updated the Urus with plug-in hybrid power, Lamborghini will soon launch the Temerario, the successor to its previous volume-selling supercar, the Huracán. It will also open a new showroom in London's Mayfair, a battleground for luxury brands that also hosts marques such as Rolls-Royce, Ferrari and Aston Martin. Sfrecola brings vital experience to the launch, having previously overseen the opening of the Lamborghini Lounge in Tokyo. He replaces Andrea Cavedagni, who has become the head of Lamborghini North America. Sfrecola said: \"The UK has a unique relationship with cars and particularly super-sports marques. Our hybridised model line-up of Revuelto, Urus SE and the Temerario due to debut shortly ensures the continued appeal and demand for our luxury brand in this important region, as endorsed by the opening of a prominent new showroom in London’s Mayfair.\" Name: Carsten Intra Company: Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles Role: CEO The CEO of Volkswagen's van-making division, Carsten Intra, has left the company after almost five years in the top job and 25 years of working for the wider Volkswagen Group. In a post made on social media platform LinkedIn, Intra said the decision to step away was \"purely personal\", having been made with his family. \"I believe this is the right moment to hand over the leadership,\" said Intra, adding that the brand's improved financial performance under his leadership, as well as the arrival of new vans such as the Transporter and ID Buzz, means it is \"now in an excellent position for a successful future\". Intra will remain with the comapany until the end of June, at which point he will hand leadership to Stefan Mecha, who currently oversees Volkswagen's car brand in China. \"I would like to take this moment to thank the entire VWCV team, especially my board team, and all partners and friends for your trust and cooperation over the past years,\" said Intra. Name: Werner Tietz Company: Volkswagen Group Role: Head of group research and development Seat and Cupra R\u0026D boss Werner Tietz has been promoted to the same position for the wider Volkswagen Group, replacing Michael Steiner. Tietz has worked within the Volkswagen Group since 1994, having cut his teeth at Audi before becoming head of body and trim for Porsche in 2011. He worked on projects such as the Taycan concept before moving to Bentley in 2018. He was named executive vice-president of R\u0026D for Seat and Cupra in 2020. Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume said: “With his vision, technical expertise and more than three decades of experience within the Volkswagen Group, Werner Tietz has played a key role in shaping the innovative strength of brands such as Audi, Porsche, Bentley and Seat-Cupra. “His work stands for forward-looking development, from sustainable materials to electrification strategy. With this extensive expertise, he will continue to drive forward research and development at the Volkswagen Group.” Steiner has ceded the role of R\u0026D chief for the wider Volkswagen Group to become deputy chairman of Porsche, in what the sports car brand describes as a \"generational change\" at its executive level. He also retains his position overseeing Porsche's R\u0026D, which he has held since 2016. Blume hailed Steiner’s \"significant contribution” to the future of the Volkswagen Group, overseeing the development of new electrical architectures and for transitioning it to the development of software-defined vehicles. “His work has been important for key decisions in the areas of automotive software, batteries, and autonomous driving,” said Blume. “I would like to personally thank him for his commitment to the Volkswagen Group.” Wolfgang Porsche, chairman of the supervisory board for Porsche, said: “We are also pleased that Dr Michael Steiner will bring his experience and expertise to the additional role of deputy chairman of the executive board.” Name: James Taylor Company: Nissan GB Role: Managing director Former Vauxhall UK boss James Taylor has been appointed Nissan GB’s new managing director. Taylor, who left his role at Vauxhall in February, succeeds Diana Torres at Nissan GB, who herself only took on the role last March. He will start his role on 1 May. Taylor joins Nissan GB ahead of a busy period for the Sunderland-based car maker, with the new Leaf and new Micra due this year and the next Juke bound to arrive in 2026. “These are very dynamic times for the automotive industry, so now, more than ever, we need to be agile and responsive to business needs and customer demands,” he said. “Nissan already makes two of the UK’s top-selling cars, has exciting new products on the way and is a brand with real momentum. \"I look forward to working with the Nissan team, its dealer partners and other stakeholders to navigate current industry challenges and build the business for sustainable future success.” Name: Josep Maria Recasens Company: Ampere Role: CEO Josep Maria Recasens has replaced Renault Group chief Luca de Meo as the CEO of its electric car development arm, Ampere. Previously Ampere's chief operating officer, he takes the helm as Ampere gears up for the launch of the Twingo city car, due next year. He will also be responsible for launching a new range of C-segment models in 2028, previewed by the Emblème concept shown earlier this year. \"I know that with Josep Maria at the helm, Ampere will continue and successfully accelerate its role as a spearhead for the Group and the European industry.\" said de Meo. Alongside Recasens, Ampere named Marie Ollier its new vice-president of human resources, Sandra Gomez its head of strategy, and Vittorio d’Arienzo its product chief. Name: Ed Jones Company: Nissan GB Role: Sales director Nissan GB has named Ed Jones its new sales director from 16 June. Among his key responsibilities will be preparing the company for the launch of the next-generation Leaf EV, as well as ensuring the continued success of the Qashqai and Juke crossovers.  Jones returns to Nissan after seven years with Audi, where he was most recently sales operations manager.  “I’m delighted to be returning at such an exciting time,” he said. “Nissan was the only brand with two models in the top five best-sellers in 2024 and, with increased market share and double-digit sales growth, it’s a brand with real momentum in 2025.” He replaces Michael Auilar, who held the position for the past two years. Names: Steve Hicks, Sanka De Silva Company: Kia UK Roles: Marketing director, sales director Kia UK has appointed Steve Hicks (left) as its new marketing director and Sanka De Silva as sales director - both effectively swapping roles. Hicks, previously sales director for Kia UK, joined the business in 2017, leading all sales channels across retail and fleet, for new and used cars. De Silva also joined in 2017, progressing to the lead the wider UK marketing team. Both men maintain equal position on the executive board of directors for Kia UK and continue to report to commercial director Simon Hetherington. Hicks said: “Kia is at a pivotal moment right now as we enhance our position as a leader in electrification and build on our range of customer-centric electrified vehicles. I am honoured to have the opportunity to lead Kia’s product positioning and marketing communications to enhance how UK consumers approach and engage with the brand.” De Silva said: “I am thrilled to be taking on this new position at such an exciting and evolving time for Kia. With such a strong product line-up in view, an engaged and committed dealer network and sales momentum at a promising rate, we’re in a positive position and I am eager to get started and lead our sales function to new heights.” Name: Peter Rawlinson Company: Lucid Motors Role: CEO Lucid chief Peter Rawlinson has stepped down after six years in charge of the electric car manufacturer. He will now take on a new role as strategic technical advisor to chairman Turqi Alnowaiser.  Meanwhile, chief operating officer Marc Winterhoff will take on the role of interim CEO. Rawlinson first joined Lucid as its chief technical officer in 2013, having previously led the development of the Tesla Model S – the saloon widely credited with having popularised electric cars in the mainstream. Lucid launched its first model, the Air saloon, in 2021. Its headline-grabbing 549-mile range – according to European WLTP testing – soon found the firm favour as a technological leader. It has, however, yet to make a profit. Indeed, Lucid made a net loss of $2.7 billion (£2.1bn) last year against revenues of $807.8 million (£638m).  The firm has pinned its hopes of success on the new Gravity, a luxury SUV based on the same underpinnings as the Air. It expects the new model to increase the firm's production from just over 10,000 cars last year to around 20,000 by the end of 2025. The Gravity will be followed by a new ‘mid-size’ SUV, due next year and pitched as a rival for the Tesla Model Y. This will spawn a saloon (to battle the Tesla Model 3) and a third model. \"Now that we have successfully launched the Lucid Gravity, I have decided it is finally the right time for me to step aside from my roles at Lucid,\" Rawlinson said in a statement. Winterhoff added: \"Lucid's technology leadership is now well established and our roadmap well defined. \"I am honoured to step into this role as we enter the next stage in our transformational journey, and I look forward to capitalising on the tremendous opportunity this presents.  \"Our team remains focused on further ramping production of the Lucid Gravity, preparing for the launch of our three mid-size platform vehicles, and continuing development of our low-cost Atlas drive unit while we aggressively reduce our costs.\" Name: James Taylor Company: Vauxhall Role: Managing director James Taylor has left the role of Vauxhall managing director, ending his 25-year run working for the British brand. He first joined Vauxhall on a student placement scheme in 1997 and returned to the firm as a commercial vehicle forecast specialist in 2000.  By 2005, he was a national business manager for Vauxhall's then-owner, General Motors, and in 2011 he took over the brand's crucial fleet sales channel. He was named Vauxhall's managing director at the end of 2022 and has been faced with one of the trickiest periods in its history since, negotiating a shift upmarket under new owner Stellantis and the introduction of several electric models while facing government mandates forcing their sale. His departure comes as Stellantis prepares to shut the historic Vauxhall plant in Luton and after the brand recorded a 21.43% decline in annual sales compared with 2023 – a significant drop but also slightly less than that felt by arch-rival Ford in the UK. In the interim, Taylor will be replaced by Stellantis UK boss Eurig Druce. His long-term successor will be announced \"in due course\", according to a company statement. “I’d like to sincerely thank James for more than a quarter of a century of loyalty and dedication to Vauxhall,” said Druce. “James leaves Vauxhall ready for the UK’s transition to an electric future, and on behalf of his many colleagues and friends, I wish him personally all the best for the future.” Taylor said: “I’d like to thank all my colleagues, past and present, for both their amazing contributions to what has been achieved – especially in recent years, transforming Vauxhall through design, technology and marketing into an electric-first brand – and I wish them every success in the future.” Name: Michelle Mortiboys Company: Aston Martin Role: Chief product engineer Michelle Mortiboys, a nominee in the 2024 Autocar Great Women awards, has announced that she is the new chief product engineer for Aston Martin. Mortiboys joins Aston Martin from supplier Aptiv, where she was responsible for managing its European programmes and its UK site. Prior to that, she was the head of automotive for Dyson and took charge of manufacturing at the Land Rover Defender factory in Nitra, Slovakia.  During her time at JLR, she also headed the firm's Special Vehicle Operations (SVO) division. Name: Alex Smith Company: Lookers Role: Chairman Alex Smith, the former managing director of Volkswagen Group UK, has been named the new chairman of dealer group Lookers.  The company has more than 150 showrooms across the UK, with 38 brands and more than 7000 cars across its new and used arms at any one time.  Smith has also been appointed to the executive committee of Lookers owner Global Auto Holdings Limited (GAHL), taking responsibility for the firm's European operations. \"We are extremely pleased to add someone of Alex’s calibre to the Lookers leadership team,\" GAHL said in a statement. \"We believe his deep automotive expertise, track record of industry leading results and overall strategic capabilities will greatly benefit both Lookers as well as GAHL’s European operations as we continue to pursue operational excellence and growth.\" Name: Frank Marotte Company: Dacia Role: Vice-president for marketing, sales and operations Dacia has named Frank Marotte its new vice-president for marketing, sales and operations. Marotte was previously the president and managing director of Toyota France, overseeing both the Toyota and Lexus brands. He started his career in automotive with Peugeot in 1993. He replaces Xavier Martinet, who left Dacia last year to lead Hyundai's European operations. Marotte will begin his new job on 1 February. Names: Giuseppe Cava, Damien Dally, Nicola Dobson, Tom Ray, Nick Richards Company: Stellantis UK Roles: Managing director for Fiat, Fiat Professional and Abarth (Cava), brand director for Leapmotor (Dally), managing director for Peugeot (Dobson), B2B director (Ray) and pre-owned vehicles director (Richards) Stellantis has revised its UK management team, appointing new managing directors for the Abarth, Fiat and Peugeot brands. Giuseppe Cava, who was most recently the UK marketing director for Fiat and Abarth, replaces Damien Dally as the sibling brands' managing director. Dally moves into the role of brand director for Chinese debutant Leapmotor. Nicola Dobson, previously the director of pre-owned vehicles, replaces Eurig Druce as Peugeot managing director following his promotion to managing director of Stellantis UK. Nick Richards takes on Dobson's former role. Tom Ray, who joined Stellantis in 2004, has been appointed B2B operations director for the UK. All will report to Druce. Name: David Beattie Company: Mini UK and Ireland Role: Director David Beattie has been named the new director for Mini UK and Ireland, replacing Federico Izzo, who has been promoted to lead the brand's European operations. Beattie has worked for the BMW Group UK since 2005 and most recently led its used car sales operation. Names: Sjoerd Knipping, Pablo Martinez Masip Company: Kia Europe Roles: Chief operating officer (Knipping), vice-president of product and marketing (Martinez Masip) Kia Europe has appointed a new chief operating officer and vice-president of product and marketing. Sjoerd Knipping (above, left), the new COO, has been promoted from his previous role as vice-president of product and marketing. He has spent more than 25 years working in the European automotive industry, having held several senior roles at Kia and Ford. Replacing Knipping as the vice-president of product and marketing is Pablo Martinez Masip (above, right), who has been Kia's global VP for customer experience since 2021. \"Going forward, our strong team supported by these executives will continue to move our bold transformation process to be a sustainable mobility solutions provider with a focus on our people and our customers,\" said Marc Hedrich, president and CEO of Kia Europe. Name: Christian Meunier Company: Nissan Role: Chairperson of the management committee for the Americas Former CEO of Jeep Christian Meunier has been named the new chairman of Nissan's management committee in the Americas. He will report directly to Nissan's new chief performance officer, Guillaume Cartier, who was appointed to right the ship after the firm's operating profits dropped by 90% during the first half of its 2024 financial year. Challenges facing Meunier include the threat of a 25% tariff on its cars exported into the US from Mexico, as well as a profitability slide that was in part caused by liberal discounting in the region. He spent 17 years with Nissan (between 2002 and 2019) before taking the top job at Jeep. He left the American manufacturer in October 2023 to \"take a long break to focus on personal interests\", according to an official Stellantis statement. Name: Damien O'Sullivan Company: VW Group UK Role: Managing director Volkswagen Group UK has named Damien O'Sullivan as its new managing director, with Alex Smith leaving after six years at the helm.  O'Sullivan will take the top job in Milton Keynes on 1 December, having run Audi in Ireland for the past three years. Prior to that, he spent time in various positions within the VW Group in China and Taiwan, having joined the company's sales division in 2009. Smith, who has been with the VW Group UK for nearly 15 years, is leaving the company \"at his own request\", according to an official statement.  His tenure as VW Group UK MD has coincided with one of the most turbulent and disruptive periods in automotive history, but he leaves the company in a strong position ahead of a transformative few years in which each of its brands are planning to launch crucial new models to the UK market. \"I’m very proud of everything the team and the networks have achieved in a period which has included Brexit, a pandemic, a supply crisis and the introduction of mass-market electromobility,\" said Smith.  \"With Volkswagen the UK’s number one passenger car brand, Audi at number two and both Skoda and Seat/Cupra achieving record market shares so far this year, as well as Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles in number two position in the van market, it feels like the right time to hand over to Damien to continue building on Volkswagen Group’s market leading performance in the UK.\" Name: Xavier Martinet Company: Hyundai Europe Role: President and CEO Dacia marketing chief Xavier Martinet will become the next president and CEO of Hyundai Europe.

The ringing of two-stroke engines at the starting line of the cross-country race was no longer a beacon for the way out. They had become more like sirens, drawing us deeper. It was an hour-long race that wound through the deep woods outside of the Barber Vintage Festival, and we were well into it. With cameras in hand, we tried to track each rider through the trees as they wrenched their throttles and battled for position in the narrow corridors. The sweet sound of vintage dirt bike motors resonated from every side of the course. Leaving this place became the last thing in our minds.…",

Royal Enfield Bear 650 by Fuel Motorcycles The Royal Enfield Bear 650 has been a home run for the Indian company. A scrambler-ized version of their popular Interceptor 650, it scores high on both specs and style, with a delicious set of liveries on offer. The platform is ripe for customization, too. Royal Enfield recently handed one to Fuel Motorcycles to see what a major custom house could do with it, and the Spanish outfit knocked it out of the park.…",

    "description": "At the global debut of the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado, the brand had teased another rugged upcoming SUV by showing a boxy silhouette. Now, fresh patent images that have surfaced on the internet point at the same SUV and also give us a preview of its final design. Touted to be a min-Fortuner for the masses, this new SUV is likely to be called the Toyota FJ Cruiser upon global debut.  New SUV is expected to revive the FJ Cruiser nameplate Expected with a range of petrol and diesel engines Is based on a derivate of Fortuner’s ladder frame chassis New Toyota FJ Cruiser: what is it? The name FJ has been a legendary moniker for Toyota with most Land Cruiser generations bearing the FJ suffix, starting from the FJ20 back in 1955. The last time Toyota used the FJ name on an SUV was for the retro-styled “FJ Cruiser” that was sold from 2006 to 2022. This all new SUV was slated to see a global debut last year, but things seems to have been delayed. Toyota FJ Cruiser to be the brand’s smallest rugged SUV FJ Cruiser based on a modified IMV ladder frame chassis The patent images confirm that this rugged SUV from Toyota is a larger evolution of the Compact Cruiser EV concept that was shown back in 2021. As per our previous reports, the new FJ Cruiser from Toyota will sit on a modified version of the IMV ladder frame chassis that currently underpins the Toyota Hilux Champ pickup sold in Thailand and Indonesia. This platform is a derivative of the IMV ladder frame setup that underpins the Hilux, Fortuner and the Innova Crysta.  The patent hints at the production-spec design of the Compact Cruiser EV concept. While the patent for this SUV was filed last year, it is only now that the image has surfaced on the internet.  Apart from the boxy stance, the patent image also confirms a proper five door layout. It has pronounced front and rear fenders and thick C-pillars with an upright rear. The future Toyota FJ Cruiser’s styling upfront has some rounded edges, but the rectangular grille, the tall front bumper and the heavy body cladding give it a rugged and utilitarian look. At the back, apart from the upright rear door, the SUV also gets a full-size spare wheel mounted at the tail gate. As for dimensions and powertrain, we expect the future Toyota FJ Cruiser to get a 2,750mm wheelbase which is identical to the Hilux Champ and also the Toyota Fortuner. Under the hood, expect a range of powertrain options, including the 2.0-litre petrol seen on the HIlux Champ, a 2.7-litre petrol and also the 2.8-litre diesel that sees duty on the Fortuner.  Some variants will get a basic 4WD setup, similar to the Fortuner and Hilux. Toyota FJ Cruiser will it come to India While Toyota has been evaluating more SUVs for India, it remains to be seen if Toyota will bring it here in the future. Expect the new Toyota FJ Cruiser to see a global debut sometime in late 2025 or early 2026.  Image Source: Oriba, via X  Also See: Toyota Fortuner mild hybrid launched at Rs 44.72 lakh New Jeep Cherokee revealed with hybrid powertrain",
