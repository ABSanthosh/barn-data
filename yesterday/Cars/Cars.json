    "description": "This 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SL is one of 1,400 Gullwing coupes built during three years of production and was shipped from the factory on August 26, 1955, to Mercedes-Benz Distributors of Manhattan, New York. Chassis 5500668 was purchased new by CCCA regional director and early Gull Wing Group member Hubert Martin Cook, who used it for participation in group events during 52 years of stewardship before his 2007 passing. After five years with the original owner’s son, the car was sold to a Texas collector who commissioned a refurbishment by Sport Leicht Restorations in North Carolina that returned the car to its original color combination of white over red leather. After the project’s completion in 2016, the car won the Mercedes-Benz Club of America Award of Excellence at the 2016 Pinehurst Concours d’Elegance before changing hands in 2018 and later being purchased by the selling dealer in 2025. Power is provided by a 3.0-liter M198 inline-six that features Bosch direct fuel injection and dry-sump lubrication. Additional equipment includes a replacement four-speed manual transmission, servo-assisted hydraulic drum brakes, four-wheel independent suspension with a rear swing axle, and body-color 15” steel wheels. This W198 is now offered in North Salem, New York, with a copy of its factory build sheet, invoices dating back to the 1960s, photos and invoices from the 2013-2016 refurbishment, a Taris Charysyn matching fitted luggage set, a tool kit, workshop and owner’s manuals, brochures, and a Florida title identifying it as a 1956 model.",

Over in the USA, SMCO modifies the LiveWire S2 Del Mar electric street tracker, while Moto Borgotaro unearths an almost-zero-mile Ducati 900 SS. BMW R80 by WalzWerk We can usually spot a Marcus Walz special a mile away, but this BMW R80 initially threw us off. That’s because while it boasts the German custom builder’s typical build quality, the aesthetic breaks from his usual vintage BMW boxer template. The look is an amalgam of styles, guided by one particular inspiration: vintage board track racers. Marcus had always loved the board trackers of the 1920s, and wondered what an air-cooled BMW board tracker would look like if the sport was still prevalent in the 70s and 80s.…",

    "description": "You’re unlikely to see a Kymco KTR 150 on the street outside of Taiwan, where it’s built and predominantly sold. But this humble single-cylinder commuter is quickly gaining fame, thanks to a growing contingent of Taiwanese workshops choosing it for their custom builds. It’s easy to see why. The KTR is readily available and affordable, and its utilitarian nature makes it a versatile platform for customization. In the hands of experienced outfits like 2LOUD Custom, it sings. The Taipei-based workshop has been churning out custom bikes at a rapid rate lately. This svelte Kymco KTR 150 scrambler is their latest project, and it’s as much a champion of the KTR’s popularity as it is a showcase for 2LOUD’s skills. According to shop boss Ma ‘Max’ Yicheng, the goal was to build a carefree street bike with vintage motocross styling.…",

    "description": "Hydration packs aren’t just for long-distance riders and desert rallies. With Mumbai’s monsoon in full swing, I’ve been using Rynox’s Navigator Hydration Backpack paired with their Reload 2.5L bladder mainly for commutes and the occasional weekend sprint. During that time, it’s proven itself to be a compact, well-executed bit of kit with a few quirks. Despite its relatively slim profile entry level price tag, the Navigator feels like serious gear. The material quality is robust, with well-stitched seams, premium-feeling zippers and a sturdy harness system. Even in daily urban chaos, it hasn’t shown any signs of wear yet. While the bright yellow accents and reflective strips are practical, they also lend it a racy, trail-ready and dare I say, Dakar ready looks. This backpack has a rather sturdy and premium feeling harness The backpack sits snug and doesn’t bounce around, even when fully loaded. The sternum strap, in particular, adds a sense of security and keeps it planted well along with a waist strap for extra sense of security and stability. However, its tall profile can rub against the pillion seat on motorcycles with a slightly raised tail section, and the hydration hose clips can occasionally make contact with your helmet when turning your head. It’s not a deal-breaker, but something you’ll need to get used to. A brighter colour for the interior would have been nicer. Ventilation and padding are adequate. It’s nothing to write home about, but it gets the job done in humid riding conditions. Total amount of storage is limited and it tops out at just 4 litres in total, with the main compartment swallowing 3.5 litres and two outer compartments offering 0.25 litres each. It’s enough for your wallet, keys, and phone charger, but if you want to carry something bulkier—like a pair of headphones—you’ll need to leave the hydration bladder behind. One silver lining is the external elastic stash made of Hypalon— the same material used to make rafts. This extra external storage is great for carrying items like gloves or even goggles on your ride and it's an idea originated by Kriega.  Smoked finish looks on cool this bladder. With the bladder full, usable space does shrink further, but as you drink through your ride, some of that space frees back up. The bag opens easily enough even with gloves on, though removing it takes a moment due to the secure strap system - a fair trade-off for the fit and stability it offers. Speaking off, the 2.5-litre bladder pairs seamlessly with the Navigator and feels just as well put together. Its smoked finish looks slick, and after a good initial rinse, I never noticed any unpleasant taste. Filling, sealing, and cleaning it are all easy tasks, and I’ve had zero leaks, even when completely topped up. Allows for better adjustment to suit riders with different builds. The hose is long enough to route from under the arm to the mouth, and while there’s no internal channel inside the bag, external clips on either side keep things in place. The bite valve comes with a dust cover and is easy to use on the go, although if you have a full-face helmet with a long chin curtain, it might take a bit of fiddling to get right. Again, subjective to your choice of helmet.  Very handy to store extra things or a wet pair of gloves. At Rs 3,550 for the Navigator Hydration Backpack and Rs 1,350 for the Reload bladder, this setup comes in at Rs 4,900—which undercuts similar offerings from premium brands like Ogio. And frankly, it doesn’t feel like a compromise. It’s well-built, functional, and suited to real-world riding conditions. The lack of a waterproof compartment is a minor letdown in monsoon, but that’s easily solved with a zip-lock or dry pouch. Price: Rs 3,550 + Rs 1.350 Where: rynoxgear.com Also see: Rynox Downtown Pro jacket review Raida UrbanR riding shoes review",

    "description": "Hero has had its sights set on younger scooter buyers for some time, and the Xoom line-up plays directly into that ambition. The new Xoom 125 offers more performance, better hardware and a more mature design than the Xoom 110. Armed with its competitive price and swanky design, is the Xoom 125 ready to take on the best in the segment? Well, here’s what we discovered. Hero Xoom 125 design and quality (8/10) It is well-equipped for the price with upmarket looks, though practicality has its limits.  The first thing that grabbed my attention was the sharper, more grown-up design. Compared to the quirky Xoom 110, this scooter feels more polished and upmarket. The 14-inch diamond-cut alloys are quite eye-catching and give it a good stance. This top-end ZX variant commands a premium of Rs 6,000 and brings a host of extra features. Key specificationsHero Xoom 125Kerb weight121kgSeat height777mmGround clearance164mmFuel tank capacity5 litresWheelbase1327mm These include two additional colour options (taking the total to four), machined alloy wheels, sequential LED indicators, a boot light, an illuminated start button, turn-by-turn navigation, an extra front storage pocket with a tethered USB charger and a boot lamp. Two fairly large cubbies that host a USB charger and can accommodate some knick-knacks. The Inferno Red paint pops nicely in daylight. However, the overall paint and plastic quality is about average, the switchgear feels a little basic, and the finish levels aren’t the best in the segment. The new sharper-looking headlamp performs quite well and will be a good companion for night commutes. That said, I’m not a huge fan of the rear design, and while the new tail-light does look sleek, it’s not nearly as unique or recognisable as the ‘X’ shaped tail-light found on the Xoom 110. This new design has also left some empty space, and the rear just ends up looking rather blank. The Xoom 125’s simple and easy-to-read LCD display does the job but with no extra flash or flair baked in. The LCD is basic and easy to read, with two buttons to help you toggle through. The USB charging port is covered with a rubber cap that appears to be reasonably weather-resistant and is tucked into the front cubby. Practicality, however, is a mixed bag. While there’s enough underseat storage for groceries and small items, it can only accommodate a half-face helmet. But the added storage at the front somewhat makes up for it, depending largely on what you’d be carrying. 17 litres of underseat storage is on the low side and won’t hold a full-sized helmet; a half-face helmet will fit. The cubby is large enough to hold small water bottles and other small items. In case you’re wondering, both cubbies have drain holes at the bottom, so they should be fairly easy to clean and rinse. The external fuel filler is a practical touch, and Hero has even added a buzzer reminder in case you forget to shut it. Overall, it’s a design that should appeal strongly to younger buyers without feeling over the top. Hero Xoom 125 riding position and comfort (7/10) The seat shape leaves both tall and short riders with some compromise. The Xoom 125 keeps the riding triangle friendly for everyday use, but it’s not what you’d call spacious. While the 777mm seat height is accessible on paper, the wide shape makes it a little tricky for riders shorter than 5’7” to be able to flat-foot. At the other end, at 6 feet tall, I found that the contour of the seat forces you to sit quite forward, which is awkward. While this seat is well-cushioned, its shape leaves both tall and short riders with a bit of compromise. There is still space for a tall rider’s knees, but the rider’s seat restricts room to move back, and you’ll start to feel cramped within half an hour. Despite having a well-cushioned seat, these factors make the ergonomics a slight compromise for both tall and short riders. Pillion space is decent and well-cushioned for short spins. Hero Xoom 125 performance and efficiency (8/10) Its peppy, low-end response makes it fun in the city. The Xoom shares its 124.6cc engine with the Destini 125, but it produces a marginal 0.79hp more. It feels eager and responsive off the line and has a good surge from standstill up to mid-range, making it enjoyable while cutting through dense city traffic. EngineHero Xoom 125Engine124.6cc, single-cyl, air-cooledPower9.9hp at 7250rpmTorque10.4Nm at 6000rpm In fact, performance is up there with the competition. In our tests, it managed 0-60kph in 7.56 seconds and 0-80kph in 15.39 seconds, on par with the company’s claims. That’s faster than Hero’s own Destini 125, despite the Xoom 125 weighing 6kg more and having larger 14-inch wheels.  PerformanceHero Xoom 125Acceleration0-60kph7.56s0-80kph15.39sRoll-on acceleration20-50kph4.49s30-70kph9.4s50-80kph11.34sBraking60-0kph (in meters)18.39m Engine refinement is another strong point, and the motor stays smooth and buzz-free even at 60-70kph and only just starts to feel a bit busy closer to 90kph. In everyday use, it offers a nice mix of pep and poise. I would have liked a nicer exhaust note to go with its sporty nature, but instead, you’re left with a rather ordinary, typical scooter drone. Despite being peppy, the Xoom 125 is quite frugal in daily use, and its city figure of 56.7kpl is aided by a start-stop system that works decently well but is not class-leadingly responsive. With a highway figure of 55.7kpl, the Xoom returns an average of 56.2kpl. A 5-litre fuel tank translates to a real-world range of a little over 250km, which is more than enough for weekly commuting duties. Hero Xoom 125 ride comfort and handling (8/10) The Xoom 125 feels agile and confident, but the braking feel could be better. One of the standout traits of the Xoom 125 is how light and flickable it feels in traffic and around corners. Despite the 14-inch wheels, it doesn’t feel cumbersome at low speeds, and their larger size only adds to its stability. The chassis feels composed and nimble, whether you’re filtering through tight spaces or taking a corner a little quicker than usual. UnderpinningsHero Xoom 125Suspension (F/R)Telescopic/monoshockBrakes (F/R)Disc/DrumTyres (F/R)110/80-R14 / 120/70-R14 In fact, even with a pillion on, the ride quality remains balanced and composed. The MRF Zapper tyres also offer solid grip in both dry and wet conditions. That said, braking performance leaves something to be desired, and while the actual stopping power is adequate, the levers feel hard and offer almost no feel, which isn’t what one would expect from a sporty scooter. The ZX variant’s 14-inch wheels are machine finished and add a touch of flamboyance. As for the ride, the suspension setup is quite well-balanced and slightly on the firmer side. That said, larger potholes and broken patches will filter through. On corners, though, it feels composed, eager and confident. It is evident that the suspension favours agility over outright plushness but still manages to find a commendable balance between the two. Hero Xoom 125 price and verdict (8/10) Not the fastest or the most practical, but it’s a stylish and capable scooter that has plenty of appeal. The ZX variant offers great additional value and equipment. At Rs 93,000, the Xoom 125 ZX finds itself priced close to the Suzuki Avenis 125 and below the TVS NTorq 125, which are its most direct rivals in terms of positioning, performance and features. The Xoom leans more toward a youthful, design-first approach, and if you’re a college student or young office-goer looking for something sharp, fun and frugal, it makes a strong case. But if comfort, space, and a premium feel matter more to you – or if you’re a taller rider – this may not be the scooter for you.

    "description": "By now you probably know most of what the Tata Harrier EV is about. We know the prices, the specifications and we even experienced it at a curated off-road event. Now though, we’ve experienced it out in the real world and put it through some preliminary performance and range tests to see just how good it is.  Tata Harrier EV: Design and engineering - 7/10 Not striking but looks smart and has good road presence. Compared to the ICE Harrier, the EV gets only some subtle styling differences. Up front, there’s a new closed off grille with strakes and below that is a revised bumper with a different air intake area. Along the sides, there’s new aero-optimised 19-inch alloys and a small EV badge on the front door. On the rear, the only distinguishing elements are the Harrier EV badge on the tailgate and the absence of a tail pipe. Overall, the Harrier EV like its ICE counterpart is a handsome looking SUV that’s big on road presence but perhaps lacks the striking wow factor associated with modern EVs. Design updates from the ICE-powered Harrier are quite subtle.  Under the skin, the Harrier is not a born-EV but a very massive ICE-to-EV conversion. While it shares the top hat with the regular Harrier, the Omega Arc platform from the ICE model has been thoroughly reengineered to feature a completely flat floor and a new electrical and electronic architecture that it calls t.idal (Tata Intelligent Digital Architectural Layer). The Harrier EV comes with two drive layouts, with the lower variants getting a rear-wheel drive setup using a permanent magnet synchronous motor and the higher variant getting AWD through an additional front mounted induction motor. This makes the Harrier EV Tata’s first 4x4 model since the Safari Storme and Hexa SUVs. Tata Harrier EV: Interior space and comfort - 8/10 Spacious and comfy for both front and rear passengers.  Like the exterior, the interior too is largely shared with the ICE Harrier. So you get the same dashboard with the touch-based AC controls, the same four-spoke steering and the digital driver’s display. The changes are the new 14.5-inch touchscreen (more on that later) and a different gear selector. Also new is the key fob which is circular and can control various functions of the car including the summon mode. Interior updates include a new 14.5-inch touchscreen and a different drive selector.  The front seats are large and comfy and there’s plenty of adjustability to find your ideal driving position. However, taller drivers will find their knee rubbing against the centre console and the wireless charger isn’t easy to access, just like on the regular Harrier. There’s plenty of storage spaces too, including large door bins and a cooled cubby below the centre armrest. Three passengers can sit at the rear in reasonable comfort. The rear seat is also a spacious and comfy place to be. There’s no shortage of legroom and kneeroom, you’re also not sitting in a knees-up position unlike most EVs and the flat floor means three adults can sit here in reasonable comfort. What adds to the experience for the outer passengers are the winged headrests which hold your head in place; helpful for when you want to nap, there are also window blinds and a boss mode which lets you move the front passenger seat from behind to liberate more room. Other features at the back include dedicated AC vents, an armrest with cupholders and USB Type C ports. Boss mode helps free up additional space behind the front passenger seat. Boot space is claimed at 502 litres, though that’s calculated up to the roof and not up to the parcel tray as in the diesel Harrier (445 litres). The electric Harrier’s boot space is lower given that the floor has risen to accommodate the rear motor but it can still fit in quite a bit. What’s nice too is that Tata has also provided a space-saver spare below. There’s also a frunk, which has a capacity of 67 litres on the RWD versions and 35 litres on the AWD. Boot has 502 litres of space, measured up to the roof.   Tata Harrier EV: Features and safety - 8/10 Not the lengthiest feature list but gets all the expected bits and a few more too.  The Harrier EV comes absolutely loaded with everything you’d expect in a modern EV. The highlight is the 14.53-inch touchscreen that’s a Samsung Neo QLED, which Tata says is the world’s first Neo QLED automotive display. This screen impresses with its resolution and vibrant colours and it's slick to operate too. There’s also a superb sounding 10-speaker JBL Black audio system with Dolby 5.1 atmos, a UPI-based in-car payment system dubbed Drive Pay, there’s onboard apps and games, ventilated and powered front seats, a panoramic sunroof, configurable ambient lighting and much more. Parking camera resolution is low and a bit choppy. There’s also a whole array of cameras, for the in-built dash camera, the 540-degree parking camera which gets a transparent bonnet feature and uniquely, a digital rearview mirror. However, while the feed for the mirror appears crisp and smooth, the parking camera appears a bit too choppy and low res. It’s also worth noting that we did face some software related glitches with our test car like a flickering screen and random warning lights in the instrument cluster.  Feed from digital rearview camera is crisp and smooth.  Now coming to the features that have perhaps been the biggest talking point. The Harrier EV gets a ‘Summon mode’ which allows you to remotely control the car to come out of tight parking spaces using the key fob. It doesn't work smoothly though and there is certainly some room to refine the software here. Also present is an auto park function wherein the car will detect a parking spot and take over all the controls to help you park. There’s even the option to manually select a parking area should you want and there’s reverse assist too which memorizes the last 50 metres of driving and automatically reverses to get you out of tight spots. What’s nice is that the auto park did work very smoothly on our test drive.  New circular key fob can be used to activate the 'Summon mode'.  As for the safety kit, the Harrier EV gets 7 airbags, disc brakes all around and TPMS and much more. Level 2 ADAS is also part of the package and Tata says the autonomous systems have been calibrated specifically for our roads and include low-speed auto emergency braking (AEB). On our short drive, the ADAS systems worked well and rarely intervened unnecessarily. And to round it off, the SUV has also received a full 5-star crash safety rating from Bharat NCAP.   Tata Harrier EV: Powertrain and refinement - 9/10 Well calibrated and strong power delivery that’s nice and refined too.  The range-topping Harrier EV we drove, dubbed QWD or Quad Wheel Drive, features a dual motor setup, with one on each axle. Combined, they put out 313hp and 504Nm which is said to be enough to propel it from 0-100kph in 6.3sec. In our preliminary testing, it managed to do it in 6.65sec which is plenty quick. It even impresses in roll-on acceleration, with 20-80kph taking 3.75sec and 40-100kph taking 3.92sec. For reference, the Harrier EV AWD is quicker than its chief rival the Mahindra XEV 9e Pack Three, across all these parameters. Tata Harrier EV specsBattery capacity65kWh75kWhDrive layout RWDRWD/AWDPower238hp238hp/313hpTorque315Nm315Nm/504Nm While performance is strong as expected, what the powertrain really stands out for is its calibration. It feels very progressive right from the get-go, with no sudden spikes in power delivery and it doesn’t dump all its power in one big chunk which can feel overwhelming. The throttle pedal has a long travel, feels natural and it's not like an on/off switch - even in the sportiest mode - which can feel like so in some other EVs. Furthermore, there’s drive modes - Eco, City and Sport - like any other Tata EV, but the Harrier also gets a new Boost mode in which it feels the most immediate and rather uniquely, a Drift mode too. Tata has also done a good job with the refinement as the cabin is well isolated from the outside world, with only some minor wind and motor noise creeping in. Performance is progressive with no sudden spikes in power delivery.  Being a 4x4, there’s also 6 off-road modes for all sorts of different terrains and having experienced the Harrier EV on a light but slushy off-road trail, I can tell you that it feels very capable. Stay tuned because we will soon be putting it to a full day off-road. There’s even four levels of regenerative braking to choose from which are operated via the paddle shifters, including a Level 0 which allows for coasting on highway but there’s no single pedal mode. Harrier EV feels capable in all sorts of terrain thanks to all-wheel drive. While the overall mechanical package is impressive, what is a bit of a downer are the brakes. The pedal feels spongy, there’s not much feel and you often have to press the pedal harder than expected to bring this big, heavy SUV to a stop. Tata Harrier EV: Range and Efficiency - 8/10  Over 400 plus kms of real world range is easily achievable.  The Harrier EV QWD we drove comes with a 75kWh LFP battery pack that’s said to give it an ARAI range of 622km or a more realistic 460-490km on Tata Motors’ C75 cycle, which represents 75 percent of the typical driving cycle from Tata Motors current customers. The rear wheel drive versions get a 65kWh battery with a lower 238hp output but a higher 627km (ARAI) claimed range. While we didn’t get a chance to do our in-depth real world range test on the media drive day, we did manage to drain the battery from 98 to 3 percent, mainly on the highway and in Eco mode, during which the Harrier EV covered 414 km. This translates to an efficiency of 5.81km/kWh and a range of 436km, which isn’t far off the claimed C75 cycle. Tata Harrier EV range and chargingBattery65kWh75kWhClaimed range (ARAI)627km622km7.2kW AC charging (10-100%)9.3 hours 10.7 hours Tata claims a 120kW DC fast charger will top up the battery from 20 to 80 percent in about 25 minutes, while a 7.2kW AC charger is said to take 10.7 hours to charge it from 10 to 100 percent. Like most of Tata’s electric cars, the Harrier EV has vehicle-to-load (V2L) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) capabilities Tata Harrier EV: Ride comfort and handling - 9/10 Brilliant ride and handling balance especially so over rough roads.  Harrier EV strikes a good balance between ride comfort and handling. Without a doubt, the Harrier EV’s standout quality is its ride comfort. Key to this is what Tata calls ‘Ultra Glide Suspension with Frequency Dependent Dampers (FDD)’, which essentially offers you the best of both worlds. This setup gives the ride a cushy and composed feel without sacrificing the handling around bends. It particularly excels on broken surfaces and at low and medium speeds, where it simply irons out all the imperfections while keeping the occupants very isolated. It's at higher speeds where you can feel a bit of vertical movements creeping in at the rear, especially over things like expansion joints, but it settles quickly and should feel better with a fully laden car. Handling too is predictable, with body roll kept well in check and there’s decent grip on offer. The steering, which can feel heavy at low speeds, has good weight and feel at higher speeds which inspires confidence. Tata Harrier EV: Price and verdict - 8/10 Well rounded product that’s competitively priced.  The Tata Harrier EV is priced from Rs 21.49 lakh for the Adventure 65kWh version, going up till Rs 28.99 lakh for the range-topping Empowered QWD 75kWh version you see here. At this price, it undercuts its main rival the Mahindra XEV 9e while offering similar range but the option of AWD over it. Like the Mahindra, prices here also do not include the cost of the 7.2kW AC charger and installation, which is set at Rs 49,000.  Harrier EV undercuts the price of its chief rival, the Mahindra XEV 9e. The Harrier EV may not have the wow factor, or the longest feature list and it needs some software fine tuning to become easier to live with. But it is a very well rounded package, it impresses with its superb ride and handling balance, a powerful and well calibrated powertrain, a good real world range and it has a comfy and spacious cabin. To borrow a children's fairy tale phrase then, it hits the Goldilocks zone; not too much, not too little. The question now is, is this what today’s electric customers want?  Also See: 2025 Tata Altroz facelift review: Sharp suiter MG Windsor EV Pro review: Going the distance",

    "description": "The Ford Bronco SUV line-up has been expanded with an all-new electric Bronco, which is set to make its global debut soon. This SUV is an all-new vehicle but borrows heavily from the design of the petrol-powered Bronco and Bronco Sport SUVs that have been on sale overseas for a few years. Christened the “Ford Bronco New Energy,” this SUV will come with pure electric and EREV (Extended Range Electric Vehicle) powertrain options. Ford Bronco EV has a 650km range (CLTC) Ford Bronco EREV to have around 1,220km range in total Ford Bronco New Energy dimensions The SUV is essentially a joint project between Ford and Jiangling Motors, which is Ford’s partner in China. In terms of dimensions, the Ford Bronco New Energy measures 5,025mm in length, 1,960mm in width, and 1,815mm in height, with a 2,950mm wheelbase. It has a curb weight of 2,630kg, making it a tad bigger than the full-size petrol-powered Ford Bronco SUV. However, both SUVs share the same 2,949mm wheelbase, according to data revealed on China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) website. The Ford Bronco New Energy is almost as long as the Kia EV9 electric SUV. Ford Bronco New Energy powertrain and battery More data revealed about the Ford Bronco New Energy indicates that the SUV will get an AWD dual-motor powertrain with a 177hp motor on the front axle and a 275hp motor in the rear, providing a combined output of 311hp and a top speed of 170kph. It comes equipped with a BYD-supplied 105.4kWh lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) blade battery, which is good for 650km CLTC range. The images also show a lidar unit above the front windshield, suggesting more advanced ADAS for the Bronco New Energy line-up. The second powertrain for the Ford Bronco New Energy is a plug-in hybrid setup, now called EREV. It comes with the same electric motor upfront as the pure EV variant, along with a smaller 245hp motor on the rear axle. There’s also a 1.5-litre petrol engine that delivers 150hp of power. Thanks to EREV technology, the petrol engine is not connected to the wheels and functions solely as a power generator for the battery or to support the electric motors. The Bronco New Energy EREV comes with a 43.7kWh battery, capable of providing a 220km range. Combined with the 1.5-litre petrol engine, the SUV can travel up to 1,220km. The Ford Bronco New Energy EREV’s curb weight is 2,510kg. Ford Bronco New Energy launch timeline The Ford Bronco New Energy will first go on sale in China and is likely to be sold in more markets in the future. Ford currently does not sell any vehicles in India but is likely to make a comeback with the Everest SUV. Meanwhile, Maruti is also currently working on EREV technology which it could introduce it in one of its mass-market products once the tech is ready for India.

    "description": "Mercedes-Benz has unveiled the third generation of the CLA Shooting Brake, making it the very first all-electric estate from the German luxury carmaker. Aside from the paradigm shift in the powertrain department, the new CLA Shooting Brake is larger than its predecessor in every way, and packs in a lot more tech too. 2025 CLA Shooting Brake gets connected headlights and tail-lamps, backlit grille cover Cabin is more spacious than CLA sedan; gets triple screens and huge panoramic glass roof 85kWh battery is standard; up to 354hp and 761km of claimed range 2025 Mercedes CLA Shooting Brake exterior design Outsizes previous-gen model. The 2025 CLA Shooting Brake measures 4,723mm in length, 1,855mm in width, and 1,469mm in height – 35mm longer, 25mm wider, and 27mm taller than the outgoing model. Its 2,790mm wheelbase is also up 61mm over the previous CLA Shooting Brake. Looks identical to CLA sedan up to the B-pillar. Expectedly, the overall design of the 2025 CLA Shooting Brake largely mirrors that of the new-gen CLA sedan, which was revealed earlier this year. Up front, there’s a connected LED headlight setup with tri-star DRL signatures, and the grille underneath houses the Mercedes-Benz insignia. Depending on the variant, the 2025 CLA Shooting Brake gets either a conventional grille or a closed-off panel with 142 illuminated stars embedded in it. Coming to the side, you get retractable door handles and aero-optimised alloy wheels, and the rounded rear section includes connected LED tail-lamps with tri-star signatures, a roof spoiler with an integrated stop lamp, and a smooth gloss black bumper. 2025 Mercedes CLA Shooting Brake interior and features Roomier on the inside. Much like the exterior, the 2025 CLA Shooting Brake’s cabin layout is virtually identical to its sedan counterpart. However, there's 26mm more headroom for second-row occupants, and the 455-litre boot (expandable up to 1,290 litres) is 50 litres more voluminous. Moreover, larger rear door apertures have made second row access easier. Trio of screens take prominence on dashboard. A triple-screen setup – comprising a 10.25-inch digital driver’s display, a 14-inch central infotainment system, and an optional 14-inch passenger display – spans the width of the 2025 CLA Shooting Brake’s dashboard. The passenger screen allows you to stream movies/TV shows and play games, and buyers who don’t opt for it get a panel with illuminated star-pattern graphics. Illuminated and dimmable panoramic glass roof. The 2025 CLA Shooting Brake also features a massive panoramic glass roof that extends from the windshield to the rear spoiler. This dimmable unit is made with heat-insulating laminated safety glass with an infrared-reflecting and low-emissivity coating, which prevents the cabin from excessively warming up during the summers and reducing heat loss during the winters. The glass surface is also embedded with 158 illuminated stars, colour-matched with the rest of the ambient lighting. 2025 Mercedes CLA Shooting Brake battery and range Both variants use an 85kWh NMC battery. Initially, the 2025 CLA Shooting Brake will be sold with electric powertrains only. The entry-level 250+ variant gets an 85kWh nickel-manganese-cobalt battery pack coupled to a single rear-mounted motor, developing 272hp and 335Nm, while the stronger 350 4Matic variants throw in an extra motor on the front axle for four-wheel-drive capability, bumping the output up to 354hp and 515Nm. Up to 761km of range. On a single charge, the 250+ variant of the 2025 CLA Shooting Brake achieves a WLTP-claimed range of 761km and the 350 4Matic variant delivers a range of 730km – 31km and 40km down, respectively, from the equivalent variants of the CLA electric sedan. Thanks to Mercedes-Benz’s 800V architecture, the CLA Shooting Brake can yield a 310km range in just 10 minutes when charging from a 320kW DC source. AC charging can be carried out at up to 22kW. 0-100kph in as little as 5 seconds. In terms of performance, the CLA 250+ Shooting Brake can complete the 0-100kph sprint in a claimed 6.8 seconds, while the dual-motor 350 4Matic variant achieves the same in 5 seconds dead. Both models have a top speed of 210kph. 2025 Mercedes CLA Shooting Brake launch details CLA sedan coming to India. The 2025 CLA Shooting Brake is set to launch in Europe in March 2026. An India launch of the estate is unlikely given that this body style doesn’t really resonate with customers here. However, the CLA sedan is headed here, and is expected to launch by the end of 2025.
