  "text": "British number one Katie Boulter was knocked out of the Ningbo Open in straight sets by Beatriz Haddad Maia.World number 10 Haddad Maia completed a 7-6 (7-2) 7-5 victory to reach the quarter-finals, where she will play Spain's Paula Badosa.The sixth seed dominated a first set tie-break following an even start and then broke Boulter in the 11th game of set two before holding serve to win the match.It is a first loss to Brazil's Haddad Maia in four meetings for the 28-year-old Briton, who beat Sara Errani in her opening match after exiting the Wuhan Open in the first round last week.Boulter, who has three career singles titles, is ranked 35th in the world, having achieved a career-high ranking of 27 in March.Later on Thursday, fellow Briton Dan Evans was denied a superb win as US Open semi-finalist Frances Tiafoe fought back from behind at the Almaty Open.Evans, who has dropped to 180th in the world, lost 6-7 (10-12) 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 to 15th-ranked Tiafoe in Kazakhstan.Bidding for his first victory against a top-20 opponent for over a year, qualifier Evans showed glimpses of his quality shot-making, and served tidily, before a slow start to the decider proved costly.The 34-year-old Englishman has endured a tough season in which he has lacked form and fitness.But his persistence and commitment to try and play his way back into form has been rewarded this week at the ATP 250 event.Evans came through qualifying to reach the second round and the confidence gained from three straight wins helped him cause serious problems for American Tiafoe.",
