  "description": "If Joao Fonseca was not on your radar before this week, he certainly will be now following his run to the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF title match. The 18-year-old is the second youngest player in tournament history, but has played with a maturity beyond his years in Jeddah, where he enters Sunday‚Äôs final undefeated. The Brazilian earned impressive wins against top seed Arthur Fils and third seed Jakub Mensik in the Blue Group play and then dispatched Frenchman Luca Van Assche in the semi-finals for the loss of just five games. Standing in his way in the title match is the second-youngest player in the field, Learner Tien. The American lost in four sets to Fonseca earlier this week and will be desperate for revenge in the championship match, which takes place at 8 p.m. local time, 6 p.m. CET and 12 p.m ET.

While he won three ATP Challenger Tour titles in 2024, more than any other player in the Jeddah field, he had only earned three tour-level victories, which all came en route to the quarter-finals in Winston-Salem. However, the 19-year-old defeated Fils, second seed Alex Michelsen and Mensik to become the first player in tournament history to beat the top three seeds. He is now just one match away from becoming the second American to win the title (Brandon Nakashima 2022), but is aware of the test that awaits. \"It would be amazing to win,‚Äù Tien said. ‚ÄúI played Joao a few days ago and it was a rough one.
