He looked stronger, but Carlos kept having short spells where he looked to be catching fire. The set featured 11 break points across 10 games in which Alcaraz struck first blood, but failed to consolidate before Sinner broke to take the set after a medical timeout for Alcaraz (clay in his eye).  In the second set, Sinner raced to a 3-0 lead, dictating rallies. Alcaraz fought back from 5-2 to level at 5-5, but Sinner’s composure shone in the tie-break. His heavy-hitting and crowd-defying focus gave him a two-set lead, leaving Alcaraz on the ropes. Alcaraz had never come back from two sets down in a Slam before, but he adjusted well in the third, standing closer to the baseline to rush Sinner. Despite Sinner breaking him in the first game and him being unable to serve it out, Alcaraz’s stunning forehand winners and a crucial re-break in the 10th game kept him alive, shifting the momentum slightly. The fourth was where things picked up. Down 3-5, 0/40, Alcaraz faced three championship points but saved them with clutch serving and Sinner’s errors (long forehand, missed return, netted shot). Alcaraz broke Sinner in the next game and dominated the tie-break, forcing a fifth set as the pro Alcaraz crowd erupted. In the fifth set, Alcaraz had the wind in his sails as Sinner wasn’t moving as well, and after an early break, he led 5-4 but couldn’t serve it out. That gave Sinner a second wind, and at 6-5, it looked back on his racket. However, Alcaraz stayed steady, forced the tie break and then unleashed a barrage of winners, crushing Sinner 10-2 in the breaker to win after 5 hours and 29 minutes. Thoughts on the Final A high-quality final and one that either player could have won. The stats tell the story: virtually nothing separated them. It came down to just a handful of points. Alcaraz’s 13–1 record in fifth sets and his composure under pressure, particularly in the final tie-break, ultimately made the difference. Did Sinner’s 6–10 record in deciding sets and his 0–7 mark in matches lasting over 3 hours and 50 minutes play a role? Possibly. But if you replayed that match 100 times, the margins would still be razor-thin; 51–49, 52–48, maybe even 50–50 either way. On clay, I think Alcaraz has the more complete game, capable of higher peaks, but also more fluctuations in level. Early on, he seemed to play too much on Sinner’s terms by trading groundstrokes at a blistering pace, going shot for shot. I expected more variety from Carlos with more shape, more spin, more disruption, but for large stretches, he went toe-to-toe. Sinner had the upper hand in those exchanges early, thanks to his effortless power and elite movement, which are near-impossible to neutralise. However, as the match wore on, Alcaraz showed more grit and adaptability. Sinner will regret those missed championship points and the loss of precision in the final tie-break. But credit to Alcaraz, he went full Novak mode when it mattered most, playing flawless tennis under the heaviest pressure. What did you think of the final? Let me know in the comments.

Down 3-5, 0/40, Alcaraz faced three championship points but saved them with clutch serving and Sinner’s errors (long forehand, missed return, netted shot). Alcaraz broke Sinner in the next game and dominated the tie-break, forcing a fifth set as the pro Alcaraz crowd erupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the fifth set, Alcaraz had the wind in his sails as Sinner wasn’t moving as well, and after an early break, he led 5-4 but couldn’t serve it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat gave Sinner a second wind, and at 6-5, it looked back on his racket. However, Alcaraz stayed steady, forced the tie break and then unleashed a barrage of winners, crushing Sinner 10-2 in the breaker to win after 5 hours and 29 minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThoughts on the Final\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA high-quality final and one that either player could have won. The stats tell the story: virtually nothing separated them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came down to just a handful of points. Alcaraz’s 13–1 record in fifth sets and his composure under pressure, particularly in the final tie-break, ultimately made the difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid Sinner’s 6–10 record in deciding sets and his 0–7 mark in matches lasting over 3 hours and 50 minutes play a role? Possibly. But if you replayed that match 100 times, the margins would still be razor-thin; 51–49, 52–48, maybe even 50–50 either way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn clay, I think Alcaraz has the more complete game, capable of higher peaks, but also more fluctuations in level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly on, he seemed to play too much on Sinner’s terms by trading groundstrokes at a blistering pace, going shot for shot. I expected more variety from Carlos with more shape, more spin, more disruption, but for large stretches, he went toe-to-toe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinner had the upper hand in those exchanges early, thanks to his effortless power and elite movement, which are near-impossible to neutralise. However, as the match wore on, Alcaraz showed more grit and adaptability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinner will regret those missed championship points and the loss of precision in the final tie-break. But credit to Alcaraz, he went full Novak mode when it mattered most, playing flawless tennis under the heaviest pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat did you think of the final?
