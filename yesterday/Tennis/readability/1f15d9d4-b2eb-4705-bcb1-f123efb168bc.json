  "description": "One of the beauties of sport -- and tennis in particular -- is its continual capacity to surprise. For instance: The Czech Republic and Kazakhstan, seeded eighth and ninth, respectively, reached the semifinals at this frenetic United Cup. But at the end of another dramatic day, it was the two top seeds -- the United States and Poland -- advancing to Sunday’s final in Sydney. Second-seeded Poland took care of Kazakhstan 3-0 and later the top-seeded USA followed with a 3-0 victory against the Czech Republic. Poland, a finalist last year before losing to Germany, looks to take the final step in this spirited 18-nation competition. The Americans, winners of the inaugural event two years ago, are intent on winning two of three titles. The final awaits 💫Team USA will battle it out for the title against Team Poland tomorrow...🇺🇸 x 🇵🇱#UnitedCup pic.twitter.com/OExajKZAQy— United Cup (@UnitedCupTennis) January 4, 2025 A marquee WTA match will kick off proceedings in Sunday’s final: World No. 2 Iga Swiatek versus No. 3 Coco Gauff. Both players have won all six of their singles and doubles matches -- and their last meeting, at the WTA Finals in Riyadh, went to Gauff. The men’s match features the No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Taylor Fritz, opposite No. 16 Hubert Hurkacz. Fritz was trailing Tomas Machac 6-7 (4), 6-5 in Saturday’s semi-finals when the Czech Republic player abruptly retired with cramp. Machac, who led 5-3 in the second, actually served for the match. “Poland’s got a great team,” U.S. captain Michael Russell said. “I think keys to the match are coming out and fighting like Coco and Taylor did so well today. It’s going to come down to maybe a few points, but we have a great bench behind us, too, so it will be fun.” Swiatek’s 7-6 (5), 6-4 victory over Kazakhstan’s Elena Rybakina in the semi-finals was a scintillating display of performance under pressure. Swiatek converted her fourth set point to finish off the 72-minute opening frame. Earlier, Hurkacz defeated Alexander Shevchenko 6-3, 6-2 in a scant 59 minutes. Swiatek -- who was wearing a wrap on her right thigh -- has now won 14 of the 15 matches she’s played at the United Cup. She holds a commanding 11-2 lead in the head-to-head. “She’s playing great,” Swiatek said of the 20-year-old Gauff. “I think at this stage she’s developing every month, and it’s going to be also a nice challenge. I can kind of play without expectations and just push for more as I did today.” Fritz has won three of the four matches he’s played against Hurkacz, most recently a 7-6 (2), 6-4 round of 16 win last year in Madrid. “I think Hubi is tough,” Fritz said. “I think one thing going for me is I think I served really well today. I have been serving well the whole tournament. So that’s something I’m definitely going to need against him.” Fritz was part of the 2022 United Cup championship team; Gauff is playing for the first time.
