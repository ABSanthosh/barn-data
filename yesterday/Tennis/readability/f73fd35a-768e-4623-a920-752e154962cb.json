  "text": "Novak Djokovic is through to the last 16 of the Miami Open after a 6-1 7-6 (7-1) win over a spirited Camilo Ugo Carabelli.The Serb, seeded fourth, looked on course for a comfortable victory against the Argentine world number 65 when he took the first set in just 34 minutes and broke early in the second.But lucky loser Ugo Carabelli began to show more resistance, breaking back immediately and forcing the tie-break.But the 24-time Grand Slam champion showed his class and comfortably took the tie-break 7-1 to seal victory.The win moves Djokovic onto 411 wins in ATP Masters 1000 events, moving him ahead of Rafael Nadal and into top spot on the all-time list.The 37-year-old, seeking a seventh Miami Open title, will play Lorenzo Musetti in the last 16 after the Italian beat Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime 4-6 6-2 6-3.Elsewhere, Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas, seeded ninth, is out after a 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 defeat to American 24th seed Sebastian Korda, while Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov beat Russian Karen Khachanov 6-7 (7-3) 6-4 7-5.",
