  "text": "Novak Djokovic cruised past Lorenzo Musetti 6-2 6-2 to reach the quarter-finals of the Miami Open.The match was delayed because of rain and world number five Djokovic, who has won six Miami titles, started slowly and was broken in the opening game as Italy's Musetti opened up a 2-0 lead.But Serbian Djokovic, 37, completely dominated the match from that point.The 24-time Grand Slam champion won nine consecutive games, closing out the first set 6-2 and moving 3-0 up in the second.World number 16 Musetti, 23, offered little resistance despite winning a couple of games as Djokovic cruised through to set up a tie with American Sebastian Korda.Korda booked his place in the quarter-finals earlier on Tuesday with a 6-4 2-6 6-4 victory over Frenchman Gael Monfils, while Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo is also through after beating Norway's Casper Ruud 6-4 6-2. In the women's draw, Italian sixth seed Jasmine Paolini defeated Poland's Magda Linette 6-3 6-2 to set up a last-four tie with either world number one Aryna Sabalenka or China's Zheng Qinwen, who play later on Tuesday in Miami.",
