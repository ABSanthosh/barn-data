  "text": "The bottom half of the draw completed their round of sixty-four matches on Wednesday, with Carlos Alcaraz storming into the third round with a 6-0 6-1 6-4 win over Yoshihito Nishioka. Alexander Zverev wasn’t far behind, coming through for the loss of just six games as he routed Pedro Martinez 6-1 6-4 6-1. 7th seed Novak Djokovic again faced difficulty, dropping a set to qualifier Jaime Faria but finished strongly to make the third round in Melbourne for the 17th time. Casper Ruud was the biggest seed to fall, falling to Jakub Mensik in four sets. His record in Melbourne is patchy at best, now with an 8-6 W:L record. Full results and select highlights below. Day Four 2025 Australian Open Round of 64 Results Winner Loser Scoreline Novak Djokovic (7) Jaime Faria (Q) 6-1 6-7(4) 6-3 6-2 Tomas Machac (26) Reilly Opelka 3-6 7-6(1) 6-7(5) 7-6(4) 6-4 Jiri Lehedcka (24) Hugo Gaston 6-3 3-1 Benjamin Boni Francesco Passaro (LL) 6-2 6-4 3-6 6-4 Jack Draper (15) Thanasi Kokkinakis 6-7(3) 6-3 3-6 7-5 6-3 Alexsandar Vukic Sebastian Korda (22) 6-4 3-6 2-6 6-3 7-5 Nuno Borges Jordan Thompson (27) 6-3 6-2 6-4 Carlos Alcaraz (3) Yoshihito Nishioka 6-0 6-1 6-4 Jakub Mensik Casper Ruud (6) 6-2 3-6 6-1 6-4 Alejandro Davidovich Fokina Felix Auger-Aliassime (29) 6-7(7) 6-7(5) 6-4 6-1 6-3 Roberto Carballes Baena James Duckworth 6-4 6-2 Tommy Paul (12) Kei Nishikori 6-7(3) 6-0 6-3 6-1 Ugo Humbert (14) Hady Habib 6-3 6-4 6-4 Arthur Fils (20) Quentin Halys 6-2 4-6 7-6(2) 7-5 Jacob Fearnley Arthur Cazaux 3-6 7-5 6-2 6-3 Alexander Zverev (2) Pedro Martinez 6-1 6-4 6-1 Djokovic Drops Another Set Novak Djokovic lost another set, but like in the opening round, he finished strongly to defeat qualifier Jaime Faria 6-1, 6-7(4), 6-3, 6-2 and advance to the third round. Unlike his opener, Djokovic got off to a solid start, taking the first set and capturing an early break in the second, but a dip in form (a minor injury?) allowed Faria to win four straight games to put himself 5-2 in front. Although the Serbian recovered the break to force a tie-break, Faria clinched the set with his powerful serve and forehand to join the select club of players who managed to win a breaker against Nole. With Andy Murray sitting courtside, Djokovic regained momentum in the third set. He faced only one break point in the final two sets and won 90% of first-serve points to close the match in three hours. Djokovic will now face Tomas Machac, who defeated Reilly Opelka in a five-set thriller, and I am interested to see what level he brings, it’s 1-1 in the H2H, and Machac can be dangerous but also inconsistent. I think I responded very well in the third and particularly fourth sets, especially in the way I ended the match. He played lights-out tennis towards the end of the second set and the beginning of the third. I had to weather the storm. He’s been practically serving two first serves the entire match. It’s not easy to play someone like that who doesn’t have anything to lose coming out. He’s a big guy, very young, so I told him on the net that the future is bright for him and that he should keep going. I love this sport. I love competition. I try to give my best every single time. It’s been over 20 years that I’ve been competing in Grand Slams at the highest level. Whether I win or lose, one thing is for sure: I’ll always leave my heart out on the court. Djokovic on his win. Alcaraz Aces Nishioka Carlos Alcaraz put in the most impressive performance from any of the top players in Melbourne so far, dropping just five games as he dispatched Yoshihito Nishioka 6-0, 6-1, 6-4. Due to his road-running style, Nishioka can often be a tricky customer, but Alcaraz had zero problems. He dominated throughout the match and won the first nine games. Alcaraz will next face Portugal’s Nuno Borges, who upset 27th seed Jordan Thompson 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 as he looks to back up his impressive run in Melbourne twelve months ago. I always considered Borges a bit of a pillow puncher at the ATP level, but some of his wins last year were impressive so maybe he will put up some resistance. I think the less time you spend on the court at the Grand Slams, especially at the beginning of the other tournament, I think it’s going to be better, especially physically,” Alcaraz said post-match. “I’m feeling great. I just tried to be focused on spending as little time as I can. I’m really happy with the serve today. Am I a serve bot?” on the camera lens. “This is something that I worked on in the preseason. In the first round I struggled a little bit, so I wasn’t too happy with the serve. Yesterday I was more focused on practising the serve. I spent more time just serving with Juan Carlos [Ferrero], with my team, and it’s something that I really want to be better. So I’m just glad that today it worked pretty well. Hopefully in the next round it is going to be better. Alcaraz on his improved serve. Zverev Moves Past Martinez Alexander Zverev produced another solid performance to defeat Pedro Martinez 6-1, 6-4, 6-1. Unlike last year he’s made serene progress through his two opening matches, and he dealt well with Martinez’s varied game style, saving all six break points. Despite dropping just six games, Sacha did make a fair few errors, but his serve (2nd best in the world as per the ATP metrics) is a huge weapon these days and consistently gets him out of trouble. Zverev will next face Jacob Fearnley. The Briton followed up his impressive win over Nick Kyrgios with a 3-6, 7-5, 6-2, 6-3 victory over Arthur Cazaux. Usually, I play 7-6 in the fifth to entertain you guys a bit, [but] I’m getting older, so I have to shorten things up a little bit. Hopefully, there will be more of that in the later rounds. I like playing night matches here, I think the atmosphere is even better at night. Every time I get the opportunity to come out here in a night session, I like to make the most of it. Zverev on his win. Other Matches of Note Czech teenager Jakub Mensik followed in Joao Fonseca’s footsteps from yesterday, pulling off the upset by defeating No. 6 seed Casper Ruud 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 in the second round on Wednesday night. The 19-year-old has captured five victories in his last seven matches against the Top 10, and Ruud’s lack of success in Melbourne continues. Jack Draper battled through a five-set thriller to defeat Thanasi Kokkinaki, winning 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 despite a hip injury. Kokkinakis served for the match at 5-4 in the fourth set, but Draper broke back to love and sealed the win with a late break in the decider. Another heartbreak match for the Aussie after his won against Murray a couple of years ago. Draper has now played back-to-back five-setters. Can he recover for the third round? Another Brit, Jacob Fearnley, backed up his win over Kyrgios with a 3-6, 7-5, 6-2, 6-3 victory over Arthur Cazaux. Tommy Paul and Kei Nishikori both had tough opening five-set matches in the third round, but the American looked the fresher in their match. Kei started well but couldn’t go the distance as Paul came through 6-7, 6-0, 6-3, 6-1. In the longest match of the day, Alejandro Davidovich Fokina came from two sets down to beat 29th seed Felix Auger Aliassime in 4 hours and 52 minutes. The Spaniard hadn’t beaten Aliassime in three previous attempts, but he loves a five-set battle and came through without dropping serve in the final three sets.  Australian Open Day 5 Round of 64 Matches Jannik Sinner (1) vs Tristan Schoolkate (WC) Marcos Giron vs Tomas Martin Etcheverry Hubert Hurkacz (18) vs Miomir Kecmanovic Matteo Berrettini vs Holger Rune (13) Alex Michelsen vs James McCabe (13) Gabriel Diallo vs Karen Khachanov (19) Francisco Cerundolo vs Facundo Diaz Acosta Tristan Boyer (Q) vs Alex de Minaur (8) Taylor Fritz (4) vs Cristian Garin (Q) Daniel Altmaier vs Gael Monfils Ben Shelton (21) vs Pablo Carreno Busta Denis Shapovalov vs Lorenzo Musetti (16) Joao Fonseca vs Lorenzo Sonego Fabian Marozsan vs Frances Tiafoe (17) Corentin Moutet vs Mitchell Krueger (Q) Learner Tien (Q) vs Danill Medvedev (5)",

He’s a big guy, very young, so I told him on the net that the future is bright for him and that he should keep going. I love this sport. I love competition. I try to give my best every single time. It’s been over 20 years that I’ve been competing in Grand Slams at the highest level.

I just tried to be focused on spending as little time as I can. I’m really happy with the serve today. Am I a serve bot?” on the camera lens. “This is something that I worked on in the preseason. In the first round I struggled a little bit, so I wasn’t too happy with the serve. Yesterday I was more focused on practising the serve. I spent more time just serving with Juan Carlos [Ferrero], with my team, and it’s something that I really want to be better. So I’m just glad that today it worked pretty well.
