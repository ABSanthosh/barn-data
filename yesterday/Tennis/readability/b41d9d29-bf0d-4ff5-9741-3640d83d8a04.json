The 26-year-old Norwegian, who lost to #NextGenATP star Jakub Mensik in the second round in Melbourne, ousted Argentine Mariano Navone 6-3, 6-3 in the Davis Cup Qualifiers first round, levelling the tie 1-1 after Tomas Martin Etcheverry gave Argentina an early lead with a win over Nicolai Budkov Kjaer. Ruud displayed clinical form on his way to securing his 28th Davis Cup match win. He won 71 per cent (35/49) of first-serve points and saved six of seven break points he faced in the 70-minute encounter. [ATP APP] Earlier, Etcheverry escaped Norway’s 18-year-old Budkov Kjaer 7-5, 2-6, 7-6(5) after a three-hour, 49-minute battle. In disbelief after the hard-fought victory, the 25-year-old Etcheverry fell on his back and covered his eyes. Etcheverry trailed 2-4 in the final set, but refused to go down. Budkov Kjaer, the 2024 Wimbledon boys’ singles champion, suffered with cramps as the match progressed. Etcheverry seized control in lengthy baseline exchanges and eventually secured his fourth Davis Cup match win.[NEWSLETTER FORM]",
