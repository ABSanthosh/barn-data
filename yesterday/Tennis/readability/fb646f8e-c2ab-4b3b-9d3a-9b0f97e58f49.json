Beyond the drama of a five-hour, 29-minute marathon ‚Äî in which he saved three straight championship points to deny rival Jannik Sinner his first Roland Garros title ‚Äî Alcaraz‚Äôs victory is rich with striking parallels and history-making significance. Following in Rafa‚Äôs footsteps Alcaraz lifted his fifth Slam trophy just one day older (22 years, 34 days) than his idol and countryman Rafael Nadal. Fittingly, Nadal‚Äôs fifth major also came in dramatic fashion. The lefty toppled Roger Federer in a legendary 2008 Wimbledon showdown, one of the most iconic battles in their 40-match Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry. Now, fans will talk about Sunday‚Äôs thriller between Alcaraz and World No. 1 Sinner in the manner they talk about Nadal and Federer‚Äôs '08 Wimbledon classic, which the Spaniard won 9-7 in the fifth set, with daylight quickly fading.

Federer, a 20-time major champion, won his first Slam at Wimbledon in 2003 and did not lose a major final until 2006 Roland Garros, where he fell to Nadal in four sets. Alcaraz earned his first major trophy at the 2022 US Open, which came with a double prize for the Spaniard. Not only was he crowned champion, Alcaraz also became the youngest No. 1 in PIF ATP Rankings history. Going for double glory The 22-year-old will chase another historic feat at Wimbledon. Alcaraz aims to become just the second player ‚Äî alongside Bjorn Borg ‚Äî to claim the Roland Garros-Wimbledon double in back-to-back seasons. Borg won the Roland Garros-Wimbledon double in 1978, '79 and '80. Alcaraz, who is first in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, has won the Wimbledon title the past two seasons, twice denying Novak Djokovic from a record-tying eighth trophy at the grass-court major.
