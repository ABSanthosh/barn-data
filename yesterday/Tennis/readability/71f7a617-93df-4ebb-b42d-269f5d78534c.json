  "description": "Jenson Brooksby claimed his first ATP Tour title in supreme style this week at the Fayez Sarofim \u0026 Co. U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship in Houston. Beginning as a qualifying wild card, the 24-year-old American completed his dramatic run Sunday with a 6-4, 6-2 final victory against second seed and 2023 Houston champ Frances Tiafoe. After saving match point in three matches en route to the title â€” one in the qualifying first round, three against third seed Alejandro Tabilo in the main-draw second round and one against top seed Tommy Paul in the semi-finals â€” Brooksby left no doubt in a brilliant final performance. \"Thank you to my team.

Two of the biggest points of the match were won by Brooksby in show-stopping fashion: He clinched the first set as he fell to the floor while executing a perfect pickup volley, and later roped a backhand passing shot on the dead run to break for 4-2 in the second set. By converting on five of six break points, according to Infosys ATP Stats, Brooksby improved to 3-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head against his countryman Tiafoe. The finalists emerged from an all-American quarter-final lineup on home soil, the first time since 1991 (Orlando) that Americans occupied all eight quarter-final spots at an ATP Tour event. \"The support has been amazing since Round 1 of qualifying,\" added Brooksby, who is now 3-3 against Top 20 players this season. \"Thank you, everybody. I've loved the support here and it's great to be back in Texas.\" Having entered the week at No. 507 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Brooksby is the third-lowest-ranked champion in ATP Tour history (since 1990). He has moved up 335 places to No. 172 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings behind his title run, trending back toward his career-high of World No. 33 in 2022.
