  "description": "The European Open, Belgium’s largest tennis tournament, is moving to Brussels after nine editions in Antwerp, the tournament announced Wednesday. From 12-19 October, the tournament will take place at the ING Arena, the former Palais 12 at Brussels Expo. “This new location allows us to take the tournament to the next level, both for players and fans,” Tournament Director Dick Norman said. The new arena’s central location makes it easy to access for visitors from both Belgium and abroad. Brussels Expo also provides more space, which will enhance the experience and comfort for all fans. “Brussels offers the ideal setting to help the tournament grow into a top-tier event, giving tennis lovers an unforgettable experience,” Norman added. In 2017, Palais 12 hosted a memorable Davis Cup match between Belgium and Australia. Steve Darcis delivered a decisive victory, creating a wave of excitement. That atmosphere is set to return this year, with fans expecting another incredible experience. The move to Brussels comes at the same time as a celebration of a decade of the European Open, the only ATP 250 tournament in Belgium. Geoffroy Bourbon, ATP Executive Vice President, Europe, said: \"We are excited to see the European Open enter its next chapter in Brussels. A strong foundation has been built over the years, and we are grateful to the organization for its dedication to tennis and the ATP Tour. The move to the ING Arena presents a fantastic opportunity to elevate the experience for players and fans, and we look forward to seeing the event thrive in its new home in the Belgian capital.\" [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
