  "text": "Day four at Roland Garros delivered some surprise upsets, gutsy five-setters, and top seeds navigating tricky conditions. Carlos Alcaraz showed why he’s one of the tournament favourites, shaking off a brief stumble to dispatch Fabian Marozsan. But the biggest shock came on Court Suzanne-Lenglen, where Portugal’s Nuno Borges stunned No. 7 seed Casper Ruud in four sets, handing the 2022 and 2023 finalist his earliest Paris exit in years. Elsewhere, Lorenzo Musetti continued to impress with a clean win over Daniel Elahi Galan, Matteo Gigante pulled off a career-best victory over a fading Stefanos Tsitsipas, and Tommy Paul dug deep to escape a two-set hole. Here’s a full rundown of the day’s action, standout performances, and what to look out for on Day Five. Day Four French Open 2025 Round of 64 Results Winner Loser Scoreline Lorenzo Musetti (8) Daniel Elahi Galan (LL) 6-4 6-0 6-4 Mariano Navone Reilly Opelka 6-1 7-6(1) 6-3 Quentin Halys Miomir Kecmanovic 4-6 6-3 7-6(2) 7-5 Holger Rune (10) Emilio Nava (WC) 6-3 7-6(5) 6-3 Frances Tiafoe (15) Pablo Carreno Busta 6-4 6-3 6-1 Sebastian Korda (23) Jensen Brooksby 6-1 6-2 7-6(2) Hamad Medjedovic Juan Manuel Cerundolo (Q) 6-3 6-4 7-5 Daniel Altmaier Vit Kopriva 6-2 4-6 6-3 7-5 Nuno Borges Casper Ruud (7) 2-6 6-4 6-1 6-0 Alexei Popyrin (25) Alejandro Tabilo 7-5 6-3 6-4 Karen Khachanov (24) Sebastian Ofner 7-5 3-6 7-5 4-6 6-2 Tommy Paul (12) Marton Fucsovics 4-6 2-6 6-3 7-5 6-2 Ben Shelton (13) Hugo Gaston Walkover Matteo Gigante (Q) Stefanos Tsitsipas (20) 6-4 5-7 6-2 6-4 Damir Dzhumur Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard (31) 7-6(4) 6-3 4-6 6-4 Carlos Alcaraz (2) Fabian Marozsan 6-1 4-6 6-1 6-2 Daily Recap Carlos Alcaraz def. Fabian Marozsan 6-1, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 On Court Philippe-Chatrier, under the roof due to weather, No. 2 seed Carlos Alcaraz outclassed Fabian Marozsan in a 2-hour, 11-minute battle. Alcaraz stormed through the first set, breaking Marozsan twice and not facing a single break point as he won 69% behind his first serve. Marozsan, who had previously upset Alcaraz in Rome 2023, countered in the second set with deft drop shots, breaking in the opening game and maintaining his advantage to level the match. Alcaraz regrouped in the third, unleashing nine winners, including a forehand passing shot to break Marozsan twice to mirror the first set. In the fourth, Alcaraz broke at 2-1 and despite failing to consolidate, he reeled off the next four games to move into the third round. The Spaniard now faces Damir Dzhumur after he took out the big-serving Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard. Nuno Borges def. Casper Ruud 2-6, 6-4, 6-1, 6-0 Nuno Borges, ranked No. 41, upset No. 7 seed Casper Ruud on Court Suzanne-Lenglen in 2 hours and 19 minutes. While I didn’t think Ruud was a likely tournament winner, seeing him drop out in the second round is somewhat surprising. Ruud took the first set 6-2, breaking Borges three times with deep groundstrokes and winning 73% of first-serve points, and it looked like the type of match we expected. However, things changed quickly, and in the second set, Ruud’s left knee, an issue since Monte-Carlo, slowed him down. Borges broke at 2-2 and maintained his advantage to level at one set all. In the third, Borges took complete charge, breaking three times to beat the Norwegian, and by that point, there was no real fight left. The fourth was a 6-0 shutout. Borges hit 51 winners and converted 8 of 12 break points, whereas Ruud landed 38 unforced errors, mainly in the last two sets. Borges is the first Portuguese man to reach the Roland Garros third round, and he now faces Alexei Popyrin, which won’t be easy but is certainly winnable. The press conference was the first I’d heard of Ruud’s knee issue, and it’s not like he’s shown anything on court that’d indicate problems; after all, he won Madrid. Does he skip grass? Probably, he’s like a fish out of water on that surface, even when fully fit, so it makes sense. It’s hopefully nothing too serious. For the last couple of weeks, I’ve been experiencing some knee pain on and off. That’s why I decided to pull out of Geneva after Rome, do my best, and heal so I can be ready here. When you’re practising, leading up to the tournament, it’s easier to avoid specific movements that are painful. It’s not unbearable. Everything is not painful. However, certain movements are what make it painful. Certain shots are painful to do. When you’re playing matches, you can’t control it in the same way. You do everything you can to get to every ball. Sometimes you forget that this is a shot I shouldn’t take, maybe in terms of the pain in my knee. That’s pretty much all. Ruud on his knee issue. Lorenzo Musetti def. Daniel Elahi Galan 6-4, 6-0, 6-4 No. 8 seed Lorenzo Musetti defeated lucky loser Daniel Elahi Galan 6-4, 6-0, 6-4 in 2 hours and 6 minutes, and the Italian has looked very sharp so far.  Despite challenging windy conditions, Musetti maintained control, converting 6 of 12 break points and hitting 38 winners to Galan’s 13. Musetti has some real craft to his game, and his slightly tweaked serve motion is working well for him. He faces Mariano Navone next, who is a tough clay courter, but I think he’s got too much in his arsenal to come unstuck in that one. It’s been a tremendous clay season so far, but the ambitions now are higher and of course here I never reached more than the fourth round. Hopefully this year will be the year, and the mentality is to try and beat everyone… I have the chance to play against everyone here, and hopefully, I will take these chances. Musetti on his win. Matteo Gigante def. Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-4, 5-7, 6-2, 6-4 Italian qualifier Matteo Gigante secured his first Top 20 victory, upsetting former finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas to reach the third round of a major for the first time. The 23-year-old’s powerful forehand and varied backhand disrupted Tsitsipas, and he saved all eight break points in the fourth set. Gigante faces Ben Shelton next after the American received a walkover from Hugo Gaston. Tsitsipas exits the Top 20 for the first time since August 2018, but it seems an age since he was a factor at any tournament other than the Monte Carlo Masters. Probably time for some coaching changes, as you can’t see where he’s improved over the last few years compared to his peers. Tommy Paul def. Marton Fucsovics 4-6, 2-6, 6-3, 7-5, 6-4 Tommy Paul staged a dramatic comeback from two sets down to defeat Marton Fucsovics, reaching the third round and matching his best Roland Garros result (2024). Trailing 5-3 in the fourth, the 28-year-old clinched his second career win from a 0-2 deficit, and while he isn’t going to, win the tournament, his clay results so far have exceeded expectations. He faces Karen Khachanov next.

Probably, he’s like a fish out of water on that surface, even when fully fit, so it makes sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s hopefully nothing too serious. For the last couple of weeks, I’ve been experiencing some knee pain on and off. That’s why I decided to pull out of Geneva after Rome, do my best, and heal so I can be ready here. When you’re practising, leading up to the tournament, it’s easier to avoid specific movements that are painful. It’s not unbearable. Everything is not painful. However, certain movements are what make it painful. Certain shots are painful to do. When you’re playing matches, you can’t control it in the same way. You do everything you can to get to every ball. Sometimes you forget that this is a shot I shouldn’t take, maybe in terms of the pain in my knee. That’s pretty much all. \u003ccite\u003eRuud on his knee issue.\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLorenzo Musetti def.
