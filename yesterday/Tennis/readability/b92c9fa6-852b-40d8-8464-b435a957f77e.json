  "description": "The doubles field for the 2024 Nitto ATP Finals is now set. Following Nathaniel Lammons and Jackson Withrow’s loss in the Rolex Paris Masters, Wesley Koolhof/Nikola Mektic, Rohan Bopanna/Matthew Ebden, Kevin Krawietz/Tim Puetz and Harri Heliovaara/Henry Patten have all qualified for the season finale. Those teams join Marcelo Arevalo/Mate Pavic, Marcel Granollers/Horacio Zeballos, Simone Bolelli/Andrea Vavassori and Max Purcell/Jordan Thompson in Turin. The year-end championships will take place at Inalpi Arena from 10-17 November. Koolhof and Mektic, the 2020 Nitto ATP Finals champions, qualified for the season finale for the second time as a team. Four years ago, the Dutch-Croatian duo lifted the trophy at The O2 in London. They have claimed four titles in 2024, triumphing in Auckland, Rotterdam, Indian Wells and Shanghai. Two of those events, Indian Wells and Shanghai, are ATP Masters 1000 tournaments. Koolhof and Mektic also made the final in ’s-Hertogenbosch and Basel. Bopanna and Ebden will compete together at the Nitto ATP Finals for the second consecutive year. They began the year on a high by winning the Australian Open. They also triumphed in Miami, made the Adelaide final and the semi-finals at Roland Garros. The Indian and Australian made the semi-finals in Turin last year, when they fell to Granollers and Zeballos. Bopanna is a two-time runner-up at the Nitto ATP Finals, advancing to the championship match in 2012 with Mahesh Bhupathi and 2015 with Florin Mergea. He also competed in the event in 2011 with Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi. Krawietz and Puetz will play in the year-end championships as a duo for the first time. Krawietz competed in the tournament each season from 2019-21, twice with Andreas Mies (2019-20) and once with Horia Tecau (2021). Puetz will make his debut. The Germans emerged victorious in Hamburg, reached a major final at the US Open and also made championship matches in Brisbane and Halle. They battled to semi-finals in both Indian Wells and Miami, while also reaching the Australian Open and Wimbledon quarter-finals. Heliovaara and Patten began their partnership during the clay-court season and teaming has paid dividends. After claiming glory in Marrakech and Lyon, they went on a dream run at Wimbledon to their first major trophy. The Finnish and British team also triumphed in Stockholm and made the final in Bucharest and Beijing. Heliovaara competed in the Nitto ATP Finals in 2022 with Lloyd Glasspool. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
