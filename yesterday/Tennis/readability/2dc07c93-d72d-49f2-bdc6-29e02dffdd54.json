  "text": "Wimbledon 2025Dates: 30 June-13 July Venue: All England ClubCoverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full coverage details.Almost four years ago, a 13-year-old Mimi Xu was part of a group of aspiring players who sat and watched Emma Raducanu stun the world with her US Open triumph.On Monday, Xu will make her Grand Slam debut at Wimbledon - and will face British number one Raducanu, who she describes as an \"inspiration\", in the first round.The 17-year-old Welsh player has been given a wildcard at the All England Club, a reward for the potential she has long showed and her progress over the past few years.Xu is ranked just outside the world's top 300 and has earned two victories over top-100 players on the British grass this summer.\"I was at the national academy in Loughborough when Emma was playing in the US Open final and me and all the girls who boarded there watched it,\" Xu said.\"We were all gathered around the TV - it was absolutely amazing. \"She's someone I've looked up to and I think she's a really good role model to have.\"Xu sat A-Level biology exams between her matches at the British grass-court tournaments, but she is now able to fully focus on tennis.The US Open junior semi-finalist believes she will not be daunted by playing 22-year-old Raducanu on one of the biggest stages in the sport - potentially on Centre Court or Court One.Xu was moving between rented accommodation when the draw was made at Wimbledon on Friday, and was left in suspense about who her opponent would be.Xu and mum Wendy started receiving messages before they had seen the news.\"It was funny because we were moving at like 10:05am and I got a message from my coach saying what an exciting draw,\" Xu said.\"And then my mum's getting messages saying 'that's so good and so exciting', but they weren't saying the name.\"So I'm like, 'oh my gosh, what is the draw? Who am I playing?' so I went onto the Wimbledon website and it wasn't there. Eventually someone told me.\"I feel like I'm really ready and excited for it. It's going to be a really good test for me - a good opportunity to go out, play and have fun.\"Xu is one of three British players aged 17 and under in the women's draw - the first time this has happened in Wimbledon history.Hannah Klugman and Mika Stojsavljevic – both aged 16 – have also been handed tough draws against seeded players.The trio have known each other since they were little and have developed together through the ranks.\"To play Wimbledon for the first time together is cool,\" US Open junior champion Stojsavljevic added.",
