  "description": "The tennis community is rallying around Americans Trevor Svajda and Zachary Svajda as their father, Tom Svajda, battles cancer. An exhibition event featuring James Blake and Brandon Nakashima will take place on Saturday, 7 December, with all proceeds directed towards Tom's medical expenses. The event, hosted at Rancho Santa Fe Tennis Club in San Diego, will feature the 22-year-old Zach partnering his brother, Trevor — a standout college player at Southern Methodist University in Dallas — in a doubles match against former World No. 4 Blake and 2022 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion Nakashima. \"This event holds a special place in my heart,\" said Zach, who climbed to No. 102 in the PIF ATP Rankings earlier this year.. \"My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, and our journey through his treatment and fight has been incredibly challenging. Supporting him through this has been one of the most difficult yet meaningful experiences of my life.\" Zach's younger brother, Trevor, explained how important the moment is for their family. “This occasion is incredibly meaningful to me, particularly because our dad is going through a difficult period,” said Trevor, who in 2023 competed in US Open qualifying after reaching the final of the USTA Boys' 18s National Championships. “The commitment of everyone attending to show their love and support truly makes a difference and means everything to us.” [ATP APP] Tom, who has worked as a tennis coach for more than 30 years, is a beloved figure in the San Diego community and beyond. Tickets to the exhibition can be purchased by clicking here. Additional donations can be made by visiting the Svajda’s GoFundMe. Blake's father, Thomas Blake Sr., lost his battle with gastric cancer in 2004. Money raised by James Blake Foundation supports the Thomas Blake Sr. Fund at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.  “I decided to participate because the tennis community is very small. It is a lifetime sport and also a family sport. I played with my parents and Zach and Trevor played with their dad. It is a sport that can be enjoyed as a family, and when a part of the tennis family is hurting, the whole community is hurting,\" said Blake. “We feel for Tom so much and want to do what we can to help the family and raise some money. So the time and energy for me to be a part of it is my pleasure. I hope it makes a meaningful difference.” Nakashima added: “I’ve known Tom and the Svajda family for more than a decade since my junior tennis days competing with Zachary. Tom has been so committed to helping his kids pursue their passion. Zachary and I have a great friendship. We train together, motivate each other, and push each other through the challenges of the tour. \"For me, it is so fulfilling to use my platform to lift up their spirits during this very difficult time. I love to give back to the community whenever I have an opportunity to do so.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
