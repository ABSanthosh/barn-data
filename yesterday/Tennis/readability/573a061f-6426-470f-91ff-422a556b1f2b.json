  "text": "Day 3 at the Monte-Carlo Country Club brought a whirlwind of action as the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters Round of 64 concluded and the Round of 32 began, delivering upsets, 48-shot rallies and gritty comebacks on the red clay. Matteo Berrettini stole the headlines, ousting top seed Alexander Zverev in a 2-6, 6-3, 7-5 epic, while defending champion Stefanos Tsitsipas battled back to defeat Jordan Thompson 4-6, 6-4, 6-2. The day wasn‚Äôt without surprises; 10th seed Holger Rune retired against Nuno Borges, and Ugo Humbert fell to Alexei Popyrin in a three-set thriller. Meanwhile, Flavio Cobolli, Arthur Fils, and Frances Tiafoe notched impressive wins to advance. Full results from Tuesday‚Äôs matches below, plus select highlights as the tournament heats up in The Principality. Day Three 2025 Monte Carlo Round of 64 and 32 Results Round of 64 Winner Loser Scoreline Nuno Borges Holger Rune (10) 6-2 3-0 RET Pedro Martinez Lorenzo Sonego 6-4 1-6 6-2 Grigor Dimitrov (15) Nicolas Jarry 6-3 6-4 Tomas Machac Sebastian Baez 3-6 6-3 6-2 Tomas Martin Etcheverry Corentin Moutet (Q) 4-6 6-1 6-4 Frances Tiafoe Miomir Kecmanovic 6-2 5-7 7-6(5) Alexei Popyrin Ugo Humbert 3-6 7-6(2) 6-4 Roberto Bautista Agut Brandon Nakashima 6-2 6-4 Flavio Cobolli Dusan Lajovic (Q) 6-4 6-2 Arthur Fils (12) Tallon Griekspoor 6-7(3) 6-4 6-2 Round of 32 Winner Loser Scoreline Matteo Berrettini Alexander Zverev (1) 2-6 6-3 7-5 Stefanos Tsitsipa (6) Jordan Thompson 4-6 6-4 6-2 Jack Draper (5) Marcos Giron 6-1 6-1 Berrettini Blasts Through Zverev Matteo Berrettini was a dominant force on clay post Wimbledon last season, and he‚Äôs similarly started 2025, firing past Sascha Zverev 2-6, 6-3, 7-5 in a two-hour, 27-minute battle. It‚Äôs the Italian‚Äôs biggest ever win in terms of ranking, although perhaps somewhat misleading as Zverev has been handing out wins against the world number 2 like sweets since the Australian Open üòÅ In this one, Zverev dominated early, racing through the first set as Berrettini struggled to find his rhythm. However, Berrettini has a potent serve and forehand, and he dialled up his aggression, levelling the match and carrying the momentum into a tense decider. At 5-4, Berrettini faltered while serving for the match, but he regrouped with flair. At 5-5, 40/40, he dug in for a grueling 48-shot rally, clinching it with a forehand winner that brought the crowd to its feet. Moments later, he broke when Zverev couldn‚Äôt retrieve a ball in the backhand corner, and this time, Berrettini didn‚Äôt waver, sealing the win on serve and raising his arms to soak in the raucous cheers. For Zverev, he has not played well since Australia, and he‚Äôs gone from having a realistic chance at world number 1 to barely winning a match. He‚Äôll look to regroup at the ATP 500 in Munich on home soil, but his forehand is a complete liability, and unless he stops pushing the ball in, the trend will continue. I have not won many matches. So it‚Äôs been the worst period since my injury for the last few months. I played a great first set, and once I got broken in the second set, I played 10 levels down. My ball is much slower. I stop hitting the ball. The same story for the last few months. Nothing changes. So it‚Äôs me who lost the match, once again‚Ä¶ I thought my level was terrible, but that‚Äôs just my opinion. It‚Äôs a matter that I‚Äôm losing. It‚Äôs as simple as that. You win one or two matches like this; there are no more questions for me in my mind. But I lost three sets in Buenos Aires, I lost three sets in Rio, I lost three sets in Indian Wells, I lost three sets in Miami, I lost three sets here, and I didn‚Äôt win a single one. So that‚Äôs the matter. Zverev on his loss. Tsitsipas Turns the Tide Against Thompson Stefanos Tsitsipas often delivers his best at the Principality, and he staged a gritty 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 comeback against Jordan Thompson on Tuesday to kick off his title defense. Thompson, who has only won 2 matches on clay at the Masters 1000 level in his career, wasn‚Äôt expected to pose much of a threat, but he caused the Greek problems early. However, Tsitsipas adjusted his game plan, shifting to a more aggressive return position in the second set, which paid dividends. Ultimately, he ended up running away a comfortable winner, winning seven of the last nine games to progress. Next up, the 26-year-old faces either Nuno Borges or Pedro Martinez in the third round. I really didn‚Äôt know what to expect, you don‚Äôt know what your opponent is capable of. He showed a good first set, he seemed to be playing quite reserved and wasn‚Äôt giving me much to work with. I was just trying to find something to reignite that consistency within my game. Tsitsipas on his win. Other Matches of Note Italian Flavio Cobolli backed up his Bucharest title by moving past qualifier Dusan Lajovic 6-4, 6-2 in a confident opening match. Fresh off his first ATP Tour title in Romania, where he defeated Sebastian Baez, Cobolli dictated play with his aggressive baseline game to firmly put to bed his woeful start to the season. He‚Äôll face 12th seed Arthur Fils in the second round after the Frenchman outlasted Tallon Griekspoor 6-7(3), 6-4, 6-2 in a two-hour, 19-minute grind. Fils, who struggled on serve early, found his rhythm in the decider, winning eight of the last ten games to advance. Elsewhere, 14th seed Frances Tiafoe survived a rollercoaster against Miomir Kecmanovic, prevailing 6-2, 5-7, 7-6(5). Tiafoe, who arrived in Monte-Carlo after competing in Houston, looked sharp in the first set but faltered as Kecmanovic battled back to force a decider. The American held firm in the third-set tiebreak, winning the final three points to advance after two hours and 43 minutes. He‚Äôll now face Alexei Popyrin, who staged a comeback of his own to upset Ugo Humbert 3-6, 7-6(2), 6-4. Will Big Foe have anything left in the tank after Houston, a trans Atlantic flight and today‚Äôs three-setter? 15th seed Grigor Dimitrov dispatched Nicolas Jarry 6-3, 6-4. The Monaco resident won 72% of his first-serve points, setting up a second-round clash with local wildcard Valentin Vacherot. Meanwhile, Nuno Borges pulled off a surprise, leading 10th seed Holger Rune 6-2, 3-0 when the Dane retired due to injury. The 2023 finalist, Rune, struggled physically, handing Borges a path to the second round, where he‚Äôll face Pedro Martinez, who battled past Lorenzo Sonego 6-4, 1-6, 6-2 in a topsy-turvy affair. Tomas Machac also impressed, overcoming serial clay winner Sebastian Baez 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 to reach the second round. The Czech, a consistent performer over the last 18 months, adjusted his game after a slow start, using his flat groundstrokes to dictate play and set up a meeting with eighth seed Alex de Minaur. Rounding out the action, Roberto Bautista Agut cruised past Brandon Nakashima 6-2, 6-4, while Tomas Martin Etcheverry fought back to defeat qualifier Corentin Moutet 4-6, 6-1, 6-4 and end his losing streak.

It‚Äôs a matter that I‚Äôm losing. It‚Äôs as simple as that. You win one or two matches like this; there are no more questions for me in my mind. But I lost three sets in Buenos Aires, I lost three sets in Rio, I lost three sets in Indian Wells, I lost three sets in Miami, I lost three sets here, and I didn‚Äôt win a single one.
