Holt, the son of former WTA World No. 1 Tracy Austin, won his maiden Challenger title at the Bangkok Open 3 while Kovacevic was crowned champion at the Oeiras Indoor 2 in Portugal. Holt and Kovacevic travelled to their respective events following second-round appearances in Australian Open qualifying. They each dropped just one set en route to their title runs. The 26-year-old Holt defeated top-seeded Czech Vit Kopriva 6-3, 6-2 in the championship match. Following his triumph, the California native is up 34 spots to No. 176 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.
