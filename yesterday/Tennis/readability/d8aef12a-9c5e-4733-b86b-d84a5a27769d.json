  "description": "Two-time finalist Daniil Medvedev advanced to the fourth round at the BNP Paribas Open after Alex Michelsen was forced to retire just 10 minutes into their maiden meeting on Sunday due to illness. Medvedev took a medical timeout himself to deal with a nosebleed in the second game, but upon resumption at 0-2, Michelsen called the match. The fifth-seeded Medvedev made an impressive start by defeating Buyunchaokete on Friday for his 200th hard-court win since 2020. The 29-year-old is now 10-5 on the season and is one victory away from a fourth consecutive ATP Tour quarter-final. “I played a very good first round, so I was looking forward to playing Alex,” said Medvedev. “I didn’t see him [play] too much, but I like the way he plays and I think it could [have been] an interesting match. It’s unfortunate for him to get food poisoning, or something like this, but it happens. “It’s not easy to play here, always tough conditions. Before the tournament I was starting to lose [my rhythm], but I got it back after the first match. I’m starting to feel better and better here.” In the fourth round, Medvedev will face 10th seed Tommy Paul, who earlier ousted 2021 champion Cameron Norrie 6-3, 7-5 to earn his 50th ATP Masters 1000 win. The 27-year-old joined Taylor Fritz as the only active American players to reach this milestone.  Following Michelsen's retirement, the third-round match between Holger Rune and Ugo Humbert has been moved from Stadium 4 to Stadium 1, where it will start not before 3:30 p.m. local time. Michelsen has also withdrawn from the doubles event, in which he partnered Ben Shelton. The American duo has been replaced by Alexander Erler and Constantin Frantzen. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
