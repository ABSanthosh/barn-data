  "description": "Rafael Nadal was honoured with the Laureus Sporting Icon Award on Monday evening in Madrid. The two-time Laureus World Sportsman of the Year (2011 and 2021) retired last November after competing for his country in Davis Cup action. \"I don't know how to start, honestly. I didn't prepare for this amazing moment, talking in front of all of you,\" Nadal said. \"But a lot of you have been sportspeople that inspired [me] since I was a kid and having the chance to talk in front of you today is something very, very special.\" The Spaniard won 92 titles and earned 1,080 tour-level match wins in his illustrious career, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. He spent 209 weeks at No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, the sixth-most weeks in history (since 1973). Edwin Moses introduced Nadal and Simone Biles handed the legendary lefty his trophy. Moses said: \"Away from the tennis court, his work with his foundation continues to change young lives for better, some 15 years after its inception. As I stand here in the Spanish capital, I'm proud to honour a global sport icon and one of his country's grestest-ever sportsmen, a man with an indomitable will to win, but wrapped in compassion, humility and sportsmanship.\" Nadal ended his speech with words of advice: \"Congrats for Simone [Biles] and the rest of you for amazing careers. Wishing you the best of luck in the future. \"The ones that keep competing, enjoy the moment, because the professional careers are short. But just try hard, enjoy and appreciate every single moment that you have the chance to enjoy this beautiful world of sport. Keep going.\" Nadal enjoyed a laugh on the red carpet with countryman Carlos Alcaraz, who was nominated for World Sportsman of the Year, won by Mondo Duplantis. Other tennis players in attendance at the 2025 Laureus World Sports Awards were Novak Djokovic, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Paula Badosa, Garbine Muguruza, Belinda Bencic, Caroline Garcia and Donna Vekic.
