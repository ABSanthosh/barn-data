I think I can become one of the best athletes out there in tennis and I'm just looking forward to seeing how much I can do.\"My natural athleticism is something that I have to use. I have to hone it, I have to polish it, it's still pretty raw and I don't think anywhere near fully developed so he's going to help me explore that.\"Nakamura has been training with Raducanu and her coach Nick Cavaday at the National Tennis Centre in London all week.After Christmas in New Zealand, Raducanu will start the season in Auckland at the end of December and also hopes to play in Adelaide before the Australian Open begins on 12 January.",
