The Austrian won 77 per cent (24/31) of points behind his first delivery, according to Infosys Stats, to wrap an 87-minute victory and qualify for the main draw in Paris for the second consecutive year.

The 23-year-old Italian Zeppieri defeated Federico Agustin Gomez 6-1, 6-4, and later found out he was facing Alcaraz after the Spaniard’s original opponent, Kei Nishikori, withdrew.
