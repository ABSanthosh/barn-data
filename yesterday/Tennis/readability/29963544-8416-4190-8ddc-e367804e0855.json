  "text": "Second Serve: Your new weekly tennis briefingIn the second edition of Second Serve, a weekly snapshot of the tennis tour, BBC tennis reporter Jonathan Jurejko looks at the talking points from Miami.In a week where the appetite for revolution has been the hot topic in the tennis world, there is a need to consider evolution for one of the sport's leading young players. The Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) launching a lawsuit against the governing bodies has largely overshadowed what has happened on court at the Miami Open.So let's shine a light on Carlos Alcaraz - and the soul-searching he will look to do before starting his European clay-court season - after a surprise early exit to Belgian veteran David Goffin.Sometimes it is easy to forget how young Alcaraz is given the success he has already achieved.Bumps in the road are inevitable for a player who does not turn 22 until the start of May - even if he has already won four Grand Slam titles.That does not stop the inquest, though, after the Spaniard's second straight defeat.Having received a first-round bye, world number three Alcaraz was completely out of sorts - making a host of sloppy mistakes which pointed to a drop in concentration and confidence.It was a similar story in his Indian Wells semi-final defeat by Britain's Jack Draper just six days earlier.Four losses in 19 matches - in a season which has included a title win in Rotterdam - does not suggest the panic button should be pressed yet.But the pattern of Alcaraz's losses raises concerns. Dominant sets showcasing his shot-making and athleticism are outweighed by ones where he displays vulnerability and nervousness.The aura of invincibility which he had developed has dropped a notch. Now he's seen as beatable.Coming from a country with little tennis pedigree, Alexandra Eala is already accustomed to being a trailblazer for the Philippines - even though she is still only 19.In 2021, Eala became the first Filipino to win a WTA Tour match and the first to win a junior Grand Slam crown with the 2022 US Open title.The triumph even led to the teenager gracing the cover of Vogue back home.Now she has announced herself to a wider global audience, having beaten Australian Open champion Madison Keys to reach the Miami last 16.\"It's a big thing to take in,\" said Eala, who has jumped 23 places in the live WTA rankings to a career-high 117th.\"I'm so super proud of what I was able to accomplish, but it definitely fuels me more.\"Next she faces Spanish 10th seed Paula Badosa and another eye-catching win will put her into the top 100.All eyes remain on Miami.The combined ATP Masters and WTA 1,000 event - played in the tier of tournaments below the four majors - hits the business end this week. With Alcaraz, Draper and Daniil Medvedev among a host of top-10 seeds already out, the men's draw has opened up and thrown up the possibility of another first-time Masters champion.Or it could be Novak Djokovic...Having cut a forlorn figure after a \"bad day in the office\" at Indian Wells, the 24-time major champion has looked more like his old self in Miami.Biggers tests await than Australia's Rinky Hijikata and Argentine lucky loser Camilo Ugo Carabelli - starting with Italy's Lorenzo Musetti in the last 16 - but he is certainly sharper having benefitted from more time on the court.The top four seeds remain in the women's draw - Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula, as does defending champion Danielle Collins.Alcaraz's struggle to find consistency demonstrates - if we didn't already know - how hard it is for the world's leading players to replicate their best every week.Jack Draper received a reminder in Miami, too.Fresh from lifting the Indian Wells title, the British men's number one was brought back down to earth with an opening defeat by talented Czech 19-year-old Jakub Mensik.More positively, Emma Raducanu answered some of the sceptics with an impressively gritty win over eighth seed Emma Navarro and is aiming to reach the quarter-finals of a WTA 1,000 event for the first time.The warp-speed rise of Jacob Fearnley is showing no signs of stopping yet.As we keep reminding you, the 23-year-old was still a university student in the United States this time last year and ranked outside of the world's top 500.Now he has provisionally become the British men's number two - overtaking former world number eight Cameron Norrie - and is on course to become a top-75 player when the rankings are updated next week.Norrie has plummeted outside the top 80 as his struggles continue, while Dan Evans - playing this week at an ATP Challenger in Naples - is on the verge of dropping out of the top 200. With so many professional tennis tournaments taking place across the world, and across so many levels, it can be hard to keep up with everything from one week to the next.As part of BBC Sport's commitment to offer more for tennis fans, Second Serve will be your weekly round-up of the biggest stories in the sport.As well as the main talking point, you can see which ATP and WTA players are making significant progress - or struggling for form, how the British contingent are doing and what the next stops on the calendars are.You can also sign up to get the latest tennis news from BBC Sport delivered straight to your mobile phone.More on this story",
