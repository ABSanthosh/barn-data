  "description": "In a year already filled with breakthrough moments, Joao Fonseca will check off another milestone at Wimbledon, where he will make his debut. Ahead of his first-round match, the 18-year-old Brazilian fine-tuned his grass-court game in a high-intensity practice session with two-time defending Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz. Alcaraz and Fonseca warmed up on the lawns of Aorangi Park by rallying crosscourt before they shifted gears into a full practise set, which Alcaraz narrowly won 7-5. The Spaniard was full of praise for Fonseca's game following the session and shared why he believes the Brazilian has the ability to excel on grass. \"I was excited about hitting with him, since the last time that I hit with him [was] in 2023 [at the Nitto ATP Finals],\" Alcaraz said. \"I have been excited to hit with him since he [arrived] on the ATP. He's quite new on grass. I've been talking with him. He's not really an experienced player on grass. But his style, he loves to play aggressively, to hit big forehands, go to the net. So I'm pretty sure he's going to get the level on grass really, really soon. \"Right now, [there are] a few things that he has to learn because he's so young and he is just starting to play the new tournaments. But his level is pretty high so far.\" Carlos doing Carlos things üòè#Wimbledon | @carlosalcaraz pic.twitter.com/EsIaG9XCrk ‚Äî Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) June 28, 2025 Earlier this week, Fonseca notched his first tour-level grass-court victory at the ATP 250 event in Eastbourne. The 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion will face Jacob Fearnley in the first round at the All England Club. Alcaraz, fresh of his Queen's Club title, will try to become just the second man in the Open Era, alongside Bjorn Borg, to complete the Roland Garros-Wimbledon double in consecutive years. The Spaniard is also aiming to become just the fifth player in the Open Era to win three consecutive Wimbledon titles. \"I really want to win the title. I really want to lift the trophy,\" Alcaraz said. \"[I'm] not thinking about how many players have done it, winning three Wimbledons in a row. I just want to be ready and just want to prepare myself in the best way possible, just to start the tournament with a lot of confidence. I feel a lot of confidence right now.\" Alcaraz will open Centre Court play on Monday against Fabio Fognini. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
