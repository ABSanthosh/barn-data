As great as these achievements were, I am reminded of Althea saying, 'No matter what accomplishments you make, somebody helped you,'\" ATA president Robert Foster said. \"This collaboration with the USTA helps us to increase awareness of the ATA, grow our brand, and help increase the tennis community footprint.\"The initiative will include a mentorship program for developing diverse tennis professionals and coaches, from the junior level and up.Reuters contributed to this report.",
