  "description": "Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic continued their perfect start to the ABN AMRO Open on Friday afternoon, but the top seeds were forced to pull through two tough sets to book their semi-final spot in Rotterdam. Arevalo and Pavic prevailed 6-4, 7-6(4) against Hugo Nys and Edouard Roger-Vasselin at the indoor hard-court ATP 500. They rallied from 0-3 to claim the opening set before clinching a 97-minute win by prevailing in a second-set tie-break. With victory, the joint No. 1s in the PIF ATP Doubles Rankings improved to 2-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series against Nys and Roger-Vasselin, following their Adelaide quarter-final triumph last month. Awaiting Arevalo and Pavic in the semi-finals at Rotterdam Ahoy will be Sander Gille and Jan Zielinski. Third seeds Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori were also straight-sets winners in Rotterdam on Friday. The Italian pair overcame qualifiers Jakob Schnaitter and Mark Wallner 7-6(3), 6-3, having won 86 per cent (32/37) of points behind first serves en route to victory, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Bolelli and Vavassori will look to continue their impressive start to 2025 when they take on Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool for a spot in the championship match. They reached the final at January’s Australian Open and are currently second in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
