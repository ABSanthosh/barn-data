  "description": "The USTA on Monday announced plans for an $800 million investment into the US Open, with highlights being the reimagination of Arthur Ashe Stadium and creation of a new player performance centre. The project will enhance and modernize Arthur Ashe Stadium, creating a new, striking Grand Entrance, increase the promenade-level concourse by 40 per cent and modernise concourses with newly designed retail experiences and food and beverage spaces. There will also be increased access to restrooms, more escalators and elevators, an upward extension of the court side-level bowl and plenty more. The new player performance centre, set to cost $250 million, will provide the sport’s stars and members of their team best-in-class amenities with indoor and outdoor performance and relaxation spaces. The facility will feature two stories on the top two floors of a four-floor building adjacent to the practice courts. [ATP APP] USTA CEO and Executive Director Lew Sherr said: “The US Open is the pinnacle of sports and entertainment, with the greatest athletes and fans in all of sport, and this reimagination of Arthur Ashe Stadium and construction of a state-of-the-art Player Performance Center will enhance the experience for everyone that comes on site to the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. “This project enables us to maintain the greatest stage in tennis - Arthur Ashe Stadium - which was constructed more than 25 years ago, and modernize it in a way that will set it up for the next 25 years. It also provides us the opportunity to give the players that compete in that stadium an unparalleled space that will enable them to perform at their best and enjoy a higher level of luxury and comfort while they are off the court. The US Open helps us to deliver on our mission - growing tennis to build healthier people and communities everywhere - by showcasing our sport on the global stage, and this reimagination will bring this presentation to an entirely new level.” The reimagination project will take place over three phases and be completed by the 2027 US Open, without interruption to scheduled play or fan access for the 2025-26 events.
