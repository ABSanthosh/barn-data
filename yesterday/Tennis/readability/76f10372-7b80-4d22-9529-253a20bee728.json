Alcaraz again broke Lehecka's serve to complete the win, letting out a roar of delight as his opponent struck a backhand into the net.Alcaraz did not face a single break point and slammed down 18 aces on his way to a 21st career title.Wimbledon starts June 30.Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",
