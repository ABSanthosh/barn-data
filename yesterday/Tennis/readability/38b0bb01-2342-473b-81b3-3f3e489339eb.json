  "text": "The 2025 Australian Open is upon us, and the draw took place on Thursday evening in Melbourne.  All the big names are present, with defending champion Jannik Sinner the top seed. While Zverev’s strong end to the season bumped him up to the second-seed position. Ten-time Australian Open champions Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz landed in the same section and are on a quarter-final collision course at the season’s first Grand Slam tournament. Elsewhere, Nick Kyrgios is back after a lengthy layoff (although he apparently has another injury scare), and Jensen Brooksby also returns after a doping suspension. Qualifying also threw some young guns into the mix, with Fonseca, Tien and Landaluce all making the main draw in Melbourne for the first time. Fonseca, who won the Next Gen ATP Finals, looks to have a deadly forehand so he’s one to watch this season.  You can see the full draw below.

Sinner opens his title defence against Chilean Nicolas Jarry, who had an indifferent end to the season after a strong start when he made the final in Rome. Should he advance, a second-round clash with Taro Daniel is likely. Marcos Giron or Flavio Cobolli could test sinner in the third round, while an intriguing fourth-round showdown looms against Hubert Hurkacz or Matteo Berrettini—both unlikely to but capable of pulling off an upset. The quarterfinals could pit Sinner against Alex de Minaur. Like Sinner, De Minaur had a stellar 2024 season that saw him reach his first ATP Finals. Last week, he announced during the ATP Cup that his legs were back after some injury problems hindered him post-US Open. De Minaur would likely need to navigate past Botic van de Zandschulp, Federico Coria, Alexander Bublik, and Stefanos Tsitsipas. All of them are dangerous but have shown too much inconsistency lately. Tsitsipas, in particular, had a poor 2024, and he didn’t look too clever at the ATP Cup, so my expectations are low.  While a Sinner vs De Minaur matchup is interesting, especially for the home fans, the Italian holds a commanding 9-0 head-to-head record over the Aussie, so it’s hard to see anything other than a comfortable Sinner victory. Second Quarter Seeded Players: (4) Taylor Fritz, (5) Daniil Medvedev, (9) Andrey Rublev, (16) Lorenzo Musetti, (17) Frances Tiafoe, (21) Ben Shelton, (25) Alexei Popyrin, (30) Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard Projected Quarterfinal: Taylor Fritz vs Daniil Medvedev Fourth seed Taylor Fritz anchors this section of the draw as he chases his elusive first Grand Slam title. The American came agonisingly close last season, reaching his maiden Major final at the US Open, only to be outclassed by Jannik Sinner in straight sets. This time, Fritz will look to go one step further, but he faces stiff competition in a stacked quarter featuring three of his fellow countrymen: Ben Shelton, Brandon Nakashima, and Frances Tiafoe. Fritz also starts his campaign against fellow American Jenson Brooksby, who’s been out injured and had a doping suspension. However, he’s a tricky opponent with an interesting game style, so he won’t make things easy. A potential second-round clash with Borna Coric could also test his consistency, while the third round might pit him against the big-serving Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard. But the real headline matchup could come in the fourth round, where Fritz is projected to face close friend and compatriot Ben Shelton. If Fritz can advance to the quarterfinals, he will likely face Daniil Medvedev or Andrey Rublev. Medvedev, the fifth seed and a last year beaten finalist, typically plays well in Melbourne but hasn’t played any warm-up events due to the birth of his second child. Can he re-find his form after a pretty poor 2024 season? Third Quarter Seeded Players: (3) Carlos Alcaraz, (7) Novak Djokovic, (10) Grigor Dimitrov, (15) Jack Draper, (22) Sebastian Korda, (24) Jiri Lehecka, (26) Tomas Machac, (27) Jordan Thompson Projected Quarterfinal: Novak Djokovic vs Carlos Alcaraz Third seed Carlos Alcaraz and seventh seed Novak Djokovic headline this quarter of the draw. Djokovic enters Melbourne with question marks after ending 2024 without winning a title and exiting the Brisbane International in the quarterfinals. In contrast, Alcaraz has yet to step onto the court this season, but he had a successful 2024 season with two Grand Slam titles. Djokovic opens his campaign against wildcard Nishesh Basavareddy, who is in the semi-finals in Auckland. This is followsemifinalstial tests against Pavel Kotov, Reilly Opelka (who beat him in Brisbane), and Grigor Dimitrov. Meanwhile, Alcaraz starts against Alexander Shevchenko. As he works through the draw, he may face Yoshihito Nishioka, Jordan Thompson, and Jack Draper. A quarterfinal showdown between Alcaraz and Djokovic would be a rematch of their Olympic Final, so it’s the match most people want to see happen. Those guys are probably my two favourite active players, so I do, too. Bottom Quarter Seeded Players: (2) Alexander Zverev, (6) Casper Ruud, (12) Tommy Paul, (14) Ugo Humbert, (20) Arthur Fils, (23) Alejandro Tabilo, (28) Sebastian Baez, (29) Felix Auger-Aliassime Projected Quarterfinal: Alexander Zverev vs Casper Ruud Second seed Alexander Zverev arrives in Melbourne in great form. Like Fritz in New York, Zverev came close to winning his first Grand Slam at the French Open, falling to Carlos Alcaraz in the final. He also reached the semi-finals at the Australian Open last year, where Daniil Medvedev stopped him. Zverev opens his campaign against wildcard Lucas Pouille in a matchup that should allow him to find his rhythm early. A second-round clash against Pedro Martinez is likely, with a third-round encounter against home favourite Nick Kyrgios potentially on the cards. In the fourth round, Zverev could face either dangerous 14th seed Ugo Humbert or rising star Arthur Fils, the 20th seed. Looking ahead, Zverev is projected to meet sixth seed Casper Ruud or 29th seed Felix Auger-Aliassime in the quarterfinals. Ruud’s experience makes him the more likely opponent. Interesting First-Round Matches Jannik Sinner (1) vs Nicolas Jarry Tomas Martin Etcheverry vs Flavio Cobolli (32) Matteo Berrettini vs Cameron Norrie Zhizhen Zhang vs Holger Rune (13) Stefanos Tsitsipas (11) vs Alex Michelsen Taylor Fritz (4) vs Jensen Brooksby Gael Monfils vs Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard (30) Ben Shelton (21) vs Brandon Nakashima Matteo Arnaldi vs Lorenzo Musetti (16) Andrey Rublev (9) vs Joao Fonseca (Q) Fabio Fognini vs Grigor Dimitrov (10) Who’s your pick to lift the trophy? 🏆",

champion Jannik Sinner heads up this quarter; he comes into Melbourne off the back of a career-defining season, overcoming a silent ban to secure eight titles in 2024, including two Grand Slams—his maiden Major at the Australian Open and a second triumph at the US Open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinner opens his title defence against Chilean Nicolas Jarry, who had an indifferent end to the season after a strong start when he made the final in Rome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould he advance, a second-round clash with Taro Daniel is likely. Marcos Giron or Flavio Cobolli could test sinner in the third round, while an intriguing fourth-round showdown looms against Hubert Hurkacz or Matteo Berrettini—both unlikely to but capable of pulling off an upset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe quarterfinals could pit Sinner against Alex de Minaur. Like Sinner, De Minaur had a stellar 2024 season that saw him reach his first ATP Finals. Last week, he announced during the ATP Cup that his legs were back after some injury problems hindered him post-US Open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDe Minaur would likely need to navigate past Botic van de Zandschulp, Federico Coria, Alexander Bublik, and Stefanos Tsitsipas. All of them are dangerous but have shown too much inconsistency lately. Tsitsipas, in particular, had a poor 2024, and he didn’t look too clever at the ATP Cup, so my expectations are low. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile a Sinner vs De Minaur matchup is interesting, especially for the home fans, the Italian holds a commanding 9-0 head-to-head record over the Aussie, so it’s hard to see anything other than a comfortable Sinner victory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSecond Quarter\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSeeded Players:\u003c/strong\u003e (4) Taylor Fritz, (5) Daniil Medvedev, (9) Andrey Rublev, (16) Lorenzo Musetti, (17) Frances Tiafoe, (21) Ben Shelton, (25) Alexei Popyrin, (30) Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProjected Quarterfinal:\u003c/strong\u003e Taylor Fritz vs Daniil Medvedev\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFourth seed Taylor Fritz anchors this section of the draw as he chases his elusive first Grand Slam title. The American came agonisingly close last season, reaching his maiden Major final at the US Open, only to be outclassed by Jannik Sinner in straight sets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, Fritz will look to go one step further, but he faces stiff competition in a stacked quarter featuring three of his fellow countrymen: Ben Shelton, Brandon Nakashima, and Frances Tiafoe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFritz also starts his campaign against fellow American Jenson Brooksby, who’s been out injured and had a doping suspension. However, he’s a tricky opponent with an interesting game style, so he won’t make things easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA potential second-round clash with Borna Coric could also test his consistency, while the third round might pit him against the \u003ca href=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/the-power-and-precision-of-giovanni-mpetshi-perricards-serve/\"\u003ebig-serving Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard\u003c/a\u003e. But the real headline matchup could come in the fourth round, where Fritz is projected to face close friend and compatriot Ben Shelton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Fritz can advance to the quarterfinals, he will likely face Daniil Medvedev or Andrey Rublev.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMedvedev, the fifth seed and a last year beaten finalist, typically plays well in Melbourne but hasn’t played any warm-up events due to the birth of his second child.

As he works through the draw, he may face Yoshihito Nishioka, Jordan Thompson, and Jack Draper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quarterfinal showdown between Alcaraz and Djokovic would be a rematch of their Olympic Final, so it’s the match most people want to see happen.

Like Fritz in New York, Zverev came close to winning his first Grand Slam at the French Open, falling to Carlos Alcaraz in the final. He also reached the semi-finals at the Australian Open last year, where Daniil Medvedev stopped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZverev opens his campaign against wildcard Lucas Pouille in a matchup that should allow him to find his rhythm early. A second-round clash against Pedro Martinez is likely, with a third-round encounter against home favourite Nick Kyrgios potentially on the cards. In the fourth round, Zverev could face either dangerous 14th seed Ugo Humbert or rising star Arthur Fils, the 20th seed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking ahead, Zverev is projected to meet sixth seed Casper Ruud or 29th seed Felix Auger-Aliassime in the quarterfinals.
