  "text": "Media caption, Draper beats Rune in Indian Wells final - highlightsWhen Jack Draper had to retire injured from his Australian Open match against Carlos Alcaraz in January, some people asked the same old questions.Was the Briton's body built for success at the top of a physically demanding sport? Could he get over the line mentally in career-defining moments?Eight weeks later, Draper has answered any lingering critics.On Sunday, he won the biggest title of his career at Indian Wells. He has also cracked the world's top 10 for the first time.This is how the 23-year-old has done it.What's changed since Melbourne?Draper was coping with a hip problem at the Australian Open and required a regular intake of painkillers to play.He came through three gruelling successive five-setters to reach the fourth round - showing he had already improved his durability - but it eventually took its toll against Alcaraz.Afterwards, Draper said he may need to manage what he described as hip tendonitis throughout the rest of his career.More difficult choices had to be made.The British number one skipped the Davis Cup tie against Japan and also pulled out of a tournament in Rotterdam in early February.He returned later that month, finishing runner-up at the Qatar Open before heading to Indian Wells.Ultimately, the \"sensible\" decision to retire against Alcaraz - and manage his workload since - has paid off.Having greater belief in his body allowed the left-hander's technical and tactical talents to flourish in the Californian desert.Consistent serving - a mixture of dangerous, swinging deliveries out wide and flatter, pacy serves - laid the platform.His forehand switched from punchy to loaded with spin, keeping opponents guessing, while sharp footwork allowed him to stay in rallies longer.\"His serve percentage over the last nine months has really gone up and that makes a huge difference,\" his mum Nicky told BBC Sport.\"But also I think he's been hitting down the line very well on his forehand. Some of those players are maybe expecting him to hit a cross-court forehand, they're almost going that way. And then when he is hitting a flatter one down the line they are not sure.\"I've seen quite a lot of them trying to slice the ball on the forehand, because they have not got the footwork in because they think it's going the other way.\"Coach James Trotman, who has worked with Draper since he was a teenager, has been a driving force in his success.\"Jack has a way of playing that we should be looking to execute first and foremost,\" he told the ATP website., external\"A big part of [our] journey is to try and impose his weapons and take the racquet out of his opponent's hand.\"How 'Team Murray' is making vital contributionFormer world number one Andy Murray might be in Novak Djokovic's coaching box nowadays, but the long-time flagbearer of British tennis continues to have an influence on Draper.Two core pillars of the recently-retired Scot's team - physiotherapist Shane Annun and fitness coach Matt Little - are now part of Draper's inner circle.Just two years ago, Draper was lamenting being known as \"the guy who got injured all the time\".Building his fitness in the gym has allowed him to compete more regularly on the tour - instrumental in his rise up the rankings.\"Being away from home, waking up early on a daily basis – it's like groundhog day,\" Draper told BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller.\"Putting in hours and hours on the court, in the gym, in the ice bath at the end of the day when I don't want to.\"It's like a normal job. Some days you really enjoy it and other times you don't want to get out of bed.\"But you do it anyway and do it to the best of your ability because you know it is going to pay off on the big stage.\"Off the court, Draper has spent nights in Indian Wells playing Monopoly Deal - a shorter version of the classic board game - and refuelling with healthy takeaways.\"As much as I enjoy playing, being around my team and doing the right thing, it's one thing saying you'll do the hard work and another to do it when you're tired and really don't want to,\" Draper added.\"That is what feels good when you're playing well on court.\"Is this the springboard to Slam success?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jack Draper won the third title of his career in Indian Wells and moved up to a career-high ranking of seventh in the worldDraper's rise over the past year has been solid and steady.His first trophy came on the Stuttgart grass in June last year, followed by an ATP 500 hard-court title in Vienna in October.His run to the US Open semi-finals captured the attention of the wider British public, although his nerves were illustrated by vomiting on court in a defeat by eventual champion Jannik Sinner.Draper began seeing a \"breathing coach\" to help solve the issue, and he pointed to the way he came through the third set against Alcaraz as an example of his improved composure.\"I had a few doubts before the Indian Wells final wondering if would feel the same things - but I didn't,\" he said.\"I was really strong and focused on my breathing and things I could control. That's what I was really proud of.\"The next step from Masters champion is a logical one - becoming a Grand Slam champion.Winning Indian Wells is no guarantee of future major success but as Dominic Thiem, Naomi Osaka and Bianca Andreescu have shown, coming through a 96-player field of the very best opponents is a strong indicator.Hard courts have been Draper's most successful surface, but the next two majors are on the French Open clay-courts and Wimbledon grass.So far he has struggled on clay, but his improved footwork should help, while the increasingly dangerous serve and groundstrokes are suited to grass-court success.\"I still feel I have a lot to prove on the clay,\" Draper added.\"I didn't get it going last year, but I don't see why I can't be pushing the best players on that surface.\"As for grass, I feel my game has improved massively since last year.\"More on this story",
