  "description": "Faced with a dialled-in opponent and with a final spot on the line, Jiri Lehecka opted for all-out attack on Saturday night at the European Open. The fifth-seeded Czech was rewarded for his courage with a 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 semi-final triumph against Marcos Giron at the indoor hard-court ATP 250. Lehecka responded emphatically to a mid-match surge from Giron by breaking the American‚Äôs serve twice in the deciding set en route to a one-hour, 57-minute victory. ‚ÄúAll the best to Marcos, he played incredible tennis, especially in the second set,‚Äù said Lehecka in his on-court interview. ‚ÄúA few times I was speechless with what he was able to produce, so I‚Äôm very happy with the win, so happy to be through and today it was a hard-fought battle. ‚ÄúAfter the second set, when I thought I wasn‚Äôt playing bad but he was just playing incredible from the back of the baseline, I knew I had to use every chance I had to push forward and to be aggressive.
