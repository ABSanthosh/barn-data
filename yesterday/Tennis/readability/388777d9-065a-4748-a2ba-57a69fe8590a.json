  "description": "Ethan Quinn has thoroughly enjoyed his first full season as a professional, whether it was winning his maiden ATP Challenger Tour title in his final tournament of the year or indulging in two off-court passions: visiting coffee shops and antique stores. The #NextGenATP American turned pro in June 2023 shortly after winning the NCAA singles title while competing for the University of Georgia. While in Athens for a memorable 16 months, Quinn became a coffee-shop enthusiast in part thanks to Georgia’s assistant coach Will Reynolds. “When we were on the road, at like 6 a.m. he would go and find a local coffee shop wherever we were at. Often times I’d just ask him, ‘Hey, can I join?’” Quinn told ATPTour.com. “By doing that, I just started to enjoy going to these local places. I felt like it was just better than buying this corporate coffee. The quality was better, the people really cared about conversing with you rather than just being a factory giving out coffee.”[ATP APP] It was also in college when Quinn began exploring antique stores — a hobby he has since brought with him while travelling across the world. “My mom got a house in Athens during my college time and the way she furnished the house was by going to antique stores, so I would go with her and I thought it was really cool going to all these different markets and little stores,” Quinn said. “Being able to furnish everything, whether it was a cheaper price, that was also nice, but also those unique pieces you would find. I thought it was really cool just having your own character, your own identity in these pieces you’d find.” Quinn’s latest collector’s item is a shiny piece of hardware, which he won after a dominant run at last week’s Champaign Challenger. The Fresno, California native downed Nishesh Basavareddy 6-3, 6-1 in the all-American #NextGenATP final. “It means a lot to finally be able to get that reward for the hard work and the struggles I've gone through this year,” Quinn told commentator Mike Cation. “Now going into the offseason, it gives me a little pep in my step. I can go into my offseason knowing that what I’m doing is working.” Ethan Quinn is crowned champion at the ATP Challenger Tour 75 event in Champaign, Illinois.

He has already been introduced to the travel hurdles that come with the job, including one which turned into an unforgettable bit of fortune. “After Newport, I was flying to Atlanta and my flight got delayed 12 hours in one hour increments,” Quinn said. “There was a man that I met in the lounge who was talking to his brother and he was like, ‘I’m chartering a jet.’ And I asked him, ‘Hey, do you have any extra seats for me and my coach to get on the plane with you. I play a tournament that starts tomorrow. Is there any way you can help me get onto the flight? I would really appreciate it.’ “He ended up charging us a much cheaper fee than what it would’ve been. I was really fortunate to meet this man and get into this tournament. If I hadn’t made it, it would’ve been a really unfortunate week.” It may have been a lesson in adapting to your circumstances, something that Quinn has also developed on court this year as he no longer competes for the Georgia Bulldogs. “One thing my coach was able to put into a term that I understood was now that I’m not competing for Georgia, I’m competing for a different team and I guess that team would be the ‘E.Q.’ team,” Quinn said, referring to his initials. “It took me a little bit to recognise that. I was leaving Georgia, I was leaving that team there. Now I’m playing for my own team. “Not just compete for yourself, but for everyone else you have been working so hard with in the shadows. I know at the start of my career, I thought it was very lonely out on the tour because everyone is not really your friend, you are competing against each other. But once I was able to realise that everyone wants the best for you, especially within your team, I was able to enjoy the whole process a little bit more.”[NEWSLETTER FORM]",
