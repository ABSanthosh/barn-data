  "text": "Image caption, Both Jannik Sinner and Alexander Zverev are appearing in a third Grand Slam finalAustralian Open 2025 - men's finalDate: 26 January Venue: Melbourne Park Time: 08:30 GMTCoverage: Live radio commentary on BBC 5 Sports Extra, plus live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and appJannik Sinner will aim to make history for Italy by defending his Australian Open title as Alexander Zverev chases a first major in the Melbourne final.World number one Sinner, 23, could become the first Italian player in history to win three Slam titles and will start the final on a career-best 20-match winning streak.German world number two Zverev is yet to win a major, having lost his previous two Grand Slam finals.It is the first time since Novak Djokovic defeated Rafael Nadal in 2019 that the top two seeds in the men's singles will contest the final at Melbourne Park.While reigning champion Sinner is the favourite, it is Zverev who leads the head-to-head record with four victories from the pair's six meetings.\"We've had some very tough matches in the past. Everything can happen,\" said Sinner.\"There is going to be a lot of tension again, but I'm happy to play in this position.\"The Australian Open men's singles final begins at 08:30 GMT on Sunday, with live coverage on the BBC Sport website and app.Sinner followed up his maiden triumph at Melbourne Park 12 months ago by winning the US Open last September.The Slam double was among eight titles he won during a stellar 2024, establishing himself as the leading player in the men's game in the same season that Rafael Nadal's retirement left Novak Djokovic as the last 'Big Three' player standing.Sinner claimed his first major in dramatic circumstances last January, recovering from two sets down to defeat Daniil Medvedev in a five-set thriller before embarking on a memorable season in which he won 73 of 79 matches.Sinner has dropped just two sets in six matches at this year's tournament, despite battling illness in his fourth-round win over Holger Rune and cramp in the semi-finals against Ben Shelton.His run to his second Australian Open final has come against the backdrop of the Italian's ongoing doping case, which will be heard behind closed doors at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) from 16-17 April.The World Anti-Doping Agency appealed against the decision to clear Sinner of blame after he twice tested positive for a banned substance last March and is seeking a one to two-year ban.\"There's a lot of things going on, on and off the court,\" said Sinner.\"I try to isolate myself a little bit, trying to be myself on the court. There are days where it's easier, days where I struggle a little bit more. \"I'm just happy to play for a big trophy again.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jannik Sinner won his most recent meeting with Alexander Zverev at the Cincinnati Open last year, ending a run of four straight losses to the GermanWhile Sinner is seeking to add his name to a list of seven men to achieve perfect records in their first three Slam finals during the Open Era, Zverev will hope to avoid becoming the sixth to lose their first three.The German has suffered five-set defeats in his previous two major final appearances.That is despite leading Dominic Thiem by two sets at the 2020 US Open and having a two-set-to-one lead over Carlos Alcaraz at last year's French Open.Zverev took the first set of his semi-final against Djokovic before the 10-time champion retired injured.Victory on Sunday would make Zverev the first German to win a men's singles title in almost 30 years, since Boris Becker triumphed at the 1996 Australian Open.\"I think Jannik has been the best player in the world for the past 12 months,\" said Zverev.\"There's no doubt about it. He has won two Grand Slams. He has been very, very stable, so definitely one of the best players in the world.\"In June 2024, Zverev's trial over domestic abuse allegations made by his former girlfriend was discontinued after a settlement was agreed between the defendant and the complainant. Zverev denied the allegations.More on this story",
