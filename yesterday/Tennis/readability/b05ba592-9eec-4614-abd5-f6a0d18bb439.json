  "text": "Australian Open 2025Dates: 12-26 January Venue: Melbourne ParkCoverage: Live radio commentary on Tennis Breakfast from 07:00 GMT on BBC 5 Sports Extra, plus live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website and appAryna Sabalenka says the Australian Open \"feels like home\" after she began her title defence with a straight-set victory over American Sloane Stephens.The world number one and back-to-back champion in Melbourne defeated Stephens 6-3 6-2 in the first round on Rod Laver Arena.The 26-year-old Belarusian is aiming to become just the seventh player to claim a third straight Australian Open women's singles title, and the first since Martina Hingis in 1999.\"I'm super happy to be back. I love this place and we have a full stadium, I couldn't dream for more,\" said Sabalenka, who overcame a wobble in the opening set to take victory.\"I don't feel like I played my best probably but I'm glad that I managed to close this in straight sets.\"It definitely feels like home.\"Sabalenka has now won 28 of her last 29 matches in hard-court Slams since the start of 2023, including 15 consecutive matches at the Australian Open.She has also won 17 consecutive sets at Melbourne Park and is the heavy favourite for the women's title.Sabalenka entertained the Melbourne crowd with some dancing on court after the match, having built up a following on social media by posting videos of her dancing with her team on TikTok.Fast becoming a fan favourite, she then went to take a picture of the crowd with a polaroid camera before realising it had run out of film.The top seed will face Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, who knocked out British hopeful Sonay Kartal, in the next round.Rain affected proceedings on the outside courts on day one of the season's first Grand Slam, but the Rod Laver Arena roof was open in time for Sabalenka's evening match after Zheng Qinwen, her opponent in last year's final, beat Romanian qualifier Anca Todoni.Sabalenka finished 2024 as the year-end world number one for the first time and, beginning her campaign in Australia as two-time defending champion and top seed, looked in fine form as she raced to a 4-0 lead.But Stephens, who has pedigree on the hard court as a former US Open champion, pegged Sabalenka back, breaking back twice for 4-3 as Sabalenka made a series of unforced errors.Often animated on court, Sabalenka roared in frustration at each mistake, waving her arms around in exasperation.What had looked likely to be a straightforward opening set of her campaign turned out to be more tricky but the three-time Grand Slam champion converted her fifth break point for 5-3 then served to take the set.Sabalenka once again earned herself a double break in the second set and this time was able to hold on to her advantage over Stephens, who has not won a match since last year's Wimbledon.By contrast, Sabalenka warmed up for the tournament by winning the Brisbane - and she looks in fine form for a historic 'three-peat'.",
