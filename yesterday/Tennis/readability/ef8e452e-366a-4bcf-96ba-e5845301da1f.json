  "description": "The first meeting of the 2025 ATP Player Advisory Council was held Friday evening in Melbourne ahead of the Australian Open. Pedro Martinez, Andrey Rublev, Camilo Ugo Carabelli, Andrea Vavassori and Jaume Munar are newly elected members of the Council for two-year terms (2025-2026), joining Alexander Zverev, Mackenzie McDonald, Dusan Lajovic, Miguel Reyes-Varela and Matthew Ebden. Throughout the season, members of the Player Advisory Council will write a diary for ATPTour.com bringing fans closer to the hard work the players do behind the scenes to help elevate the sport. This time, new PAC member Jaume Munar picks up the pen. # # # Hello everyone, happy new year and I hope you are all excited for the new season just like we are! I am so happy to be part of the ATP Player Advisory Council for the first time. It was a long time ago that I started thinking of trying to be a Council member. I am 27, but I have always wanted to help the players and present our opinions on every matter possible on Tour. I have gained experience over the past seven years and I hope to use that to be helpful for the ATP. I know quite a lot of people from the players' side to talk to whom I can discuss important topics and I feel confident that I can do a really good job here. I was in touch with Rafael Nadal, a former member of the Council, a lot during the last year of his career and I know the path he and all the people on the Council took. It’s such a good thing to have the opportunity to follow in their footsteps and keep growing the sport. It is a lot of responsibility to be a member of the Council, but at the end, it is more than just us — we are only voices here in the Council. The real responsibility is with all the players to get involved, to try to understand the situations we are dealing with and to try to move forward to deliver for the members and to improve the standards in different areas. The first meeting was nice. I have known most of the people here for a long time, so it felt normal to be part of the group. I was taking notes and trying to put myself in a position to help others. I think it is important for me to have an opinion in these meetings, to be the voice of everyone who elected me and to put the new and fresh ideas on the table to move forward. The relationship with the other players should go both ways. I represent them, so I know how important it is to provide the members with information so they are fully aware of what is going on with the Tour and so they can feel confident in us. I would also be happy if they give me their thoughts and ideas to bring to the Council so that everyone can have their voices heard. It is giving something to receive something. That’s how I feel about being on the Council and to be a representative for everybody here. I just want to be a good member of the council and to have the chance to move forward in the topics that matter the most. In this meeting, I was able to rely on my own experiences when we discussed the ATP Challenger Tour and provide my perspective. Explaining my mindset as a player not only helps my fellow Council members and our Player Board representatives understand things that might not affect them as directly, but it also gives ATP leadership more insight to help them continue improving the product. During my career I have taken online classes and always do everything I can to learn outside of tennis. To keep educating yourself, to keep learning — not just on the court — is very important. It is nice and it really makes my journey more rewarding and I really want to keep improving in all the areas I can. This is just one more step in my life. We are tennis players today, but we don’t know where we will be tomorrow, and I hope to bring that mindset to our meetings. Fans see us competing our hardest in front of millions of fans around the world. But we are humans, too. We have a future after tennis. We have a family and a life. I want fans to know that I have clear ideas, I have priorities in my life. Tennis is of course one, but it is not the only one. I feel like everything I can do outside of tennis is important and that’s why I dedicate so much time to other things like the Council. I am looking forward to a great year ahead. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
