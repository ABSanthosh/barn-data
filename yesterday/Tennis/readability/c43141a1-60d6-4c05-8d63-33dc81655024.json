  "description": "A day after being knocked out of the Nitto ATP Finals in Turin, Carlos Alcaraz landed in Málaga to join the Spanish team, which will take the court against the Netherlands in the Davis Cup Final 8. It’s a competition that is always special, but this time will be a momentous occasion because it will be Rafael Nadal’s last tournament as a professional. And the significance of it hasn’t eluded Alcarez. Far from it. ‘It’s probably the most special tournament I’ll play in my career, because of what’s happening, because of the circumstances,’ Alcaraz began. ‘The Davis Cup has always been a tournament that I’d love to win one day, I’m passionate about representing Spain. I’ve said it many times: one of the greatest things in the world is being able to represent your country in any field. Having Rafa by my side, knowing it’s his last tournament, will make it much more special,’ he went on. ‘I’ll try to contribute and help the team any way I can – for me, for Spain and especially for Rafa. No player deserves more to finish the incredible career he had with a title, and I know how special the Davis Cup is for him. It will be a difficult challenge but winning it for Rafa is a huge motivation.’ [ATP AWARDS] Alcaraz, 21, is clear about what the priorities are for the next week, aware that Nadal’s farewell is a unique moment in his life. ‘Rafa’s farewell is much more important, at least for me,’ said Alcaraz. ‘The Davis Cup is every year. Rafa’s farewell, saying goodbye to a legend of the sport, unfortunately only happens once. The Davis is very important, representing your country and trying to win it for Spain, but personally I’m very excited to be by Rafa’s side for his farewell. And the fact that it’s in the Davis, which is a very important tournament for him, virtually where he started his career with that victory against Roddick... Being able to retire in this competition is special, and it is for me, too. It will be an incredible event because of the occasion and hopefully it will end with the title.’ Alcaraz helped Spain qualify for the Final 8, scoring two singles points in Valencia (against Ugo Humbert in the series against France and Tomas Machac in the tie with the Czech Republic) and one in doubles (joining forces with Marcel Granollers to defeat Jakub Mensik and Adam Pavlasek). Spain will take the court on Tuesday against the Netherlands in the Davis Cup Final 8. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
