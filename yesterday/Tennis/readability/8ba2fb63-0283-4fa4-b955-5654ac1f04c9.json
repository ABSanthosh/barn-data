  "description": "A busy week on the ATP Tour will feature a host of Top 10 stars competing across three ATP 250 events in Marseille, Delray Beach and Buenos Aires, respectively. Former champion Daniil Medvedev returns to the Open 13 Provence in Marseille, where he leads the field at the indoor hard-court event. Two-time defending champion Taylor Fritz will compete at home at the Delray Beach Open, while recent Australian Open finalist and World No. 2 Alexander Zverev heads to the clay in Buenos Aires, where he is the top seed at the IEB+ Argentina Open. ATPTour.com breaks down five things to watch at each event. [HOT SHOT] FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN MARSEILLE: 1) Medvedev Seeks Big Reaction: Medvedev will look to claim a first tour-level title since the 2023 ATP Masters 1000 in Rome when he leads the field in Marseille. The 28-year-old triumphed at the ATP 250 event in 2021 but has not competed there since. He seeks a strong reaction after being stunned by qualifier Mattia Bellucci in the second round at the ATP 500 in Rotterdam last week. 2) Defending Champ Humbert: Second seed and home favourite Ugo Humbert returns to the site where he won his fifth ATP Tour crown. The Frenchman has reached at least the semi-finals in each of his three appearances in Marseille and will look to ignite the indoor form that propelled him to the championship match at the Rolex Paris Masters last year. 3) Khachanov, Mpetshi Perricard Among Indoor Threats: Top 20 star Karen Khachanov seeks to impose himself on his first indoor event of the season. The 28-year-old has won four tour-level titles on indoor hard courts, including the Marseille crown in 2018. The big-serving Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard also aims to exploit his aggressive style in his debut appearance in Marseille.   4) Gasquet, Stan Lead Wild Cards: Richard Gasquet continues his farewell tour as a wild card in Marseille. The former No. 7 in the PIF ATP Rankings announced that he will retire after Roland Garros in 2025. Three-time major winner Stan Wawrinka will also compete as a wild card at the event where has reached the quarter-finals in three of his five appearances. 5) Nys/Roger-Vasselin Top Seeds: Hugo Nys and Edouard Roger-Vasselin will chase their first title as a team when they headline the doubles action in Marseille. The Monegasque-French duo will aim to build on its positive start to the year, in which it reached the quarter-finals in Adelaide, at the Australian Open and in Rotterdam. FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN DELRAY BEACH: 1) Two-time Defending Champ Fritz: World No. 4 Fritz has his sights set on a three-peat at the Delray Beach Open this year. The American has won the previous two editions of the tournament, and he will seek to bounce back quickly from a disappointing second-round loss in Dallas last week. 2) #NextGenATP Tien: Learner Tien will hope to continue his standout start to the year in Delray Beach, where he enters as a wild card. The 19-year-old, who reached the championship match at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF in December, will aim to build some momentum after he upset Medvedev en route to the fourt round at the Australian Open last month.  Watch 2024 Delray Beach Final Highlights: 3) Norrie, Opelka Among Former Champs: Cameron Norrie put in an impressive showing to win the Delray Beach title in 2022 and the former World No. 8 returns for his first appearance since he lifted the trophy. American Reilly Opelka, who reached the quarter-finals in Dallas last week, won his second ATP Tour crown at the 2020 Delray Beach Open and is one to watch as he continues his return from injury. 4) Michelsen Seeks First Title: After his run to the fourth round at the Australian Open, fast-rising Alex Michelsen is at a career-high No. 36 in the PIF ATP Rankings. The 20-year-old American has reached three tour-level finals on home soil (0-3), but can he improve with a title run in Delray Beach? 5) Withrow/Zeballos Lead Doubles: Jackson Withrow and Horacio Zeballos will headline the doubles action in Delray Beach, where they team for the first time. Withrow won four tour-level titles with Nathaniel Lammons in 2024, while Zeballos qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals with Marcel Granollers, but can they bring that form into their new pairing this week? [ATP APP] FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN BUENOS AIRES: 1) Zverev Seeks More Glory On Clay: Top seed Zverev will make his anticipated debut at the clay-court ATP 250 in Buenos Aires, where he aims to add to his eight tour-level titles on the surface. Last year’s Roland Garros finalist is competing in his first event since his defeat to Jannik Sinner in the Australian Open final last month. 2) Rune, Musetti Lead Top 20 Stars: World No. 14 Holger Rune commences his clay-court season in Buenos Aires, where he is aiming to improve on his first-round exits in each of his two prior appearances. Lorenzo Musetti will also look to find his best form on the clay. The Italian won the bronze medal at last year's Paris Olympics, which was held at Roland Garros. 3) Fonseca Ready To Shine: Joao Fonseca will aim to continue his rapid rise in Buenos Aires, where he arrives after an impressive run in Australia. Last year’s Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion carried his momentum into a stunning performance at the Melbourne major, where the 18-year-old notched a straight-sets victory over World No. 9 Andrey Rublev in his main-draw Grand Slam debut. 4) Defending Champ Diaz Acosta: Facundo Diaz Acosta holds fond memories of Buenos Aires, where he produced a stunning run to clinch his first ATP Tour title at the 2024 edition. The Argentine will head into his title defence with a 3-2 record in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. 5) Gonzalez/Molteni Top Seeds: Maximo Gonzalez and Andres Molteni will look to draw on their 2024 clay-court exploits when they return to home soil in Buenos Aires this week. The Argentines won both of their two ATP Tour titles last year on the surface, in Cordoba and Barcelona, respectively. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
