  "text": "Draper sets up Indian Wells semi-final with AlcarazMedia caption, Draper beats Shelton to set up Alcaraz semi-finalJack Draper beat big-serving American Ben Shelton 6-4 7-5 on a cold and blustery evening in Indian Wells to set up a tantalising semi-final against two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.Britain's Draper reached his first Grand Slam semi-final at September’s US Open but had never before made it to the last four at a Masters 1000 event.If the 23-year-old beats four-time major champion Alcaraz on Saturday he will be guaranteed a place in the world’s top 10 for the first time. \"I’m always proud of myself,” said Draper, who is yet to drop a set in the tournament.\"Unfortunately in tennis you're in a sport where there is always the next match and you have to prove yourself every time.“I'm never content with anything. I always want to have more wins and more opportunities to play top players.\"Draper has played Alcaraz four times, with his sole win coming on grass at Queen’s last year.Spanish world number three Alcaraz beat Argentina’s Francisco Cerundolo 6-3 7-6 (7-4) to record his 16th successive match win in California.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jack Draper's previous best run at Indian Wells was a fourth-round showing in 2023Draper won the first set against Shelton with a serving performance every bit as commanding as the one he produced in his fourth-round win over Taylor Fritz.He conceded just three points on serve, and one break was enough to secure the first set.However, the partisan crowd did not take too long to find its voice, with Shelton's huge ground strokes helping him win the first three games of the second set.A frustrated Draper was given a warning for unsportsmanlike conduct after hitting a ball high into the stands in the third game, but he refocused to force the set back on serve.The match turned decisively in his favour when Shelton double-faulted to give Draper a chance to serve for a semi-final spot.He went 0-30 down but reeled off the next four points to secure victory.\"I felt like maybe the conditions suited me a little bit more,\" Draper told BBC Sport.\"His serve would be bouncing very high if it were lively, but I felt it was a challenge for both of us dealing with the wind and the dead conditions.\"However, the Briton expects no such advantage against Alcaraz.\"I think these courts bring out the best in him,\" Draper added.\"He can show all his skills and look for his forehand.\"I think the conditions really suit him - but then again, he does well in most circumstances.\"'I said sorry, I don't normally celebrate like this'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Daniil Medvedev once said that not celebrating victories was going to be his \"thing\"Daniil Medvedev will face Holger Rune in Saturday's other semi-final.Russia's Medvedev, runner-up here the past two years, beat France's Arthur Fils 6-4 2-6 7-6 (9-7)Medvedev is famous for not celebrating his victories but made an exception this time, leaping into the air four times with sheer delight after Fils missed a volley on match point.\"I was surprised, and that got my adrenaline too much. I couldn't control it,\" the fifth seed said.\"I jumped next to him. Then I was, like, sorry, man, I usually don't celebrate like this.\"But I lost three very tight matches this year, two of which I was really close to winning.\"The more you lose matches like this, the more you lose confidence in these tight moments.\"He will face Denmark's Rune, who beat Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor 5-7 6-0 6-3, for a place in the final.",
