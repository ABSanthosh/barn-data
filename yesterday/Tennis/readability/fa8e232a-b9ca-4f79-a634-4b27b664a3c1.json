  "description": "Taylor Fritz and Coco Gauff arrive in Perth off the back of stellar finishes to the 2024 season looking to translate that form into team success for USA at the United Cup. Fritz capped a standout year, in which he made title-match runs at the US Open and Nitto ATP Finals, by reaching a career-high of No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings, while Gauff continued to hit new heights. In Riyadh last month, the 20-year-old World No. 3 became the youngest player to win the prestigious WTA Finals since Maria Sharapova in 2004. On Sunday they will unite to lead Team USA onto court against Canada in their opening Group A clash. “I'm super pumped to have Coco as my partner,” Fritz told ATPTour.com in Perth. “It's great playing mixed and knowing I can fully trust the person that I'm playing with. She's won a lot in doubles and she's obviously an incredible doubles player.” [ATP APP] Although Gauff boasts an impressive doubles resume - nine tour-level titles including the 2024 French Open - mixed is a different game. Fritz and Gauff found that out at the Paris Olympics, where they notched just one win. Yet despite their underwhelming cameo in the French capital, Team USA is no stranger to success on the international stage, underpinned by the key role Fritz played en route to the inaugural United Cup title in 2023. “I think a big key to our team's success in 2023 was the team chemistry and the vibes,” said Fritz, who won seven of his eight matches during their title run. “In these team events, energy is a really underrated factor in teams playing well. “Enjoying everyone's company, that's something that our team has always done well.\" Team USA at the 2025 United Cup in Perth. Photo: Tennis Australia After failing to progress to the knockouts last time out in Perth, Team USA will be keen to reignite that team atmosphere this week in Perth. As the leading man and woman, Fritz and Gauff will look to Danielle Collins and Desirae Krawczyk on the bench for that extra burst when they need it. Yet judging from their vibrant media-day antics, it doesn’t seem that they will have much trouble finding it. “Danielle is definitely the most feisty,” Gauff said with a laugh. “She has already told me some of the things she would try to pull if she was to step out on the court. She’s a great sub, I played some points with her and she was playing great.” “Des really [has been] a cheerleader the last two years,” Fritz added. “She's a great team member for someone who hasn't played in the last two years. She's always done an amazing job on the bench.” Fritz and Gauff will have a shot at avenging their Olympics loss to Felix Auger-Aliassime and Gabriela Dabrowski when they face Team Canada in their opening Group A tie. Starpower is one thing they will have on their side, belief is another. “Fom knowing Taylor, I feel that our approach is very similar, mindset-wise,” said Gauff. “I think the belief factor that I have, he has the same - that’s the biggest [similarity]. Some guys I see, they may believe in themselves, but I think Taylor [really] does. “I think if things get pretty tense, I'll definitely look to the bench for energy, and I'll be right there cheering Taylor on [in the singles] when I can. I think I'm excited and looking forward to that.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
