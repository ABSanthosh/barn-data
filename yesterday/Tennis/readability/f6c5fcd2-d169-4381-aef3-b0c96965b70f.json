  "description": "Camilo Ugo Carabelli earned one of the most memorable and dramatic wins of his career at the Movistar Chile Open on Tuesday. The Argentine fended off three match points and staged a thrilling deciding-set comeback, edging past 2023 champion and home favourite Nicolas Jarry 5-7, 6-3, 7-6(9). Jarry will rue his first match point at 5-4 in the third set when he missed a routine backhand volley in the net. The 25-year-old Ugo Carabelli won four consecutive points from 2/5 in the deciding-set tie-break, including a dramatic exchange at 3/5 when Jarry celebrated prematurely, shouting \"Vamos!\" ‚Äî believing the point was over ‚Äî only for the Argentine's forehand to clip the baseline and sail past the seventh seed. ‚ÄúI feel very happy.

Tuesday marked Ugo Carabelli and Jarry‚Äôs first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, though they clashed four times on the ATP Challenger Tour and once at a tour-level qualifying event.
