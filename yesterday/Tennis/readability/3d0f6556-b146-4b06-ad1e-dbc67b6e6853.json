  "description": "Arthur Cazaux notched a bittersweet victory Monday evening to kickstart his campaign at the Open Occitanie in Montpellier. The 22-year-old produced a commanding performance to advance past former World No. 3 Stan Wawrinka 6-4, 6-3 at the hard-court ATP 250 event. Cazuax, a Montpellier native, will team with Wawrinka on the doubles court tomorrow, but that did not stop him from putting on a show to outfox the 39-year-old in 88 minutes. ‚ÄúIt was such an honour for me to share the court with him today,‚Äù Cazaux said of three-time major winner Wawrinka. ‚ÄúOf course I watched him on TV when I was very young, when he won three Grand Slams. It was an honour, but it wasn‚Äôt easy for me because we talked together before the tournament about playing doubles and we also practised together two days ago. ‚ÄúI am happy with my win today. I had to stay focused because he played better in the second set. He served better so it wasn‚Äôt easy for me to pressure on his service games. I‚Äôm pretty happy with the win because I played a pretty good level during the whole match.‚Äù next-level shot placement üéØüî•@ArthurCazaux | @OpenOccitanie | #openoccitanie pic.twitter.com/b1hv9jvCO3 ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) January 27, 2025 The key to Cazaux‚Äôs victory was his rock-solid display on serve, where he won 85 per cent (29/34) of points behind his first delivery, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

There were glimpses of the tennis that propelled Wawrinka to three major titles, but the Swiss player was unable to convert any of the two break points he created.
