The 18-year-old Brazilian raced past Luca Van Assche 4-2, 4-2, 4-1 to book his championship-match spot at the 20-and-under event in Jeddah, where he will take on Learner Tien for the trophy on Sunday from 8 p.m. local time (6 p.m. CET/12 p.m. ET). The No. 145 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Fonseca struck the ball with depth and fierce power off both wings to overwhelm Van Assche and become the lowest-ranked finalist in tournament history. ‚ÄúOn hard courts, [I‚Äôve never had such a good week],‚Äù said Fonseca in his on-court interview. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm playing a very high level. I‚Äôm just very proud of myself and the way that I‚Äôve been with my routine this week, so focused.

The Brazilian converted four of 14 break points he earned, according to Infosys ATP Stats, while he did not face any on his own serve. ‚ÄúToday was a great match. I played really solidly,‚Äù said Fonseca. ‚ÄúI did what I talked about with my coach. He didn‚Äôt have too many chances because I was playing so aggressively and making all the shots. There is one more match to go, and I hope I can for it.‚Äù The one-hour encounter against Van Assche was in stark contrast to Fonseca‚Äôs five-set victory against Jakub Mensik 24 hours earlier, when the Brazilian prevailed in five sets that all went to tie-breaks. His group-stage campaign also included the biggest win of his career by PIF ATP Ranking against World No. 20 Arthur Fils. Fonseca began the week as the lowest seed in an eight-man field but is now the only undefeated player left standing after Tien earlier defeated Alex Michelsen in the opening semi-final of the day. Sunday‚Äôs final at King Abdullah Sports City will be the second Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting of the week between Fonseca and Tien, after the Brazilian claimed a four-set triumph in the group stage.
