Another clean performance from him and the typical display of precision hitting that has propelled him to the world’s number-one spot this season. The Italian headed in as the betting favourite, and after a tight first set that resulted in a tiebreak, he took charge to land his 3rd Masters 1000 title of the season comfortably. Djokovic has had a good week after a relatively long absence from competitive play, but he didn’t create a single break point on Sinner’s serve, nor did he even manage to reach deuce in any return games. This is uncharacteristic, and he didn’t move that well, certainly not as well as he would need to against Sinner.

But to counter that, Djokovic has an imperious record in Shanghai, so it would always be close, but he wasn’t quite at Sinner’s level. In the first set, the four-time champion looked capable of getting the job done. He struck the ball nicely and took good care of his service games. The problem was Sinner readily matched him, snuffing out the one dangerous moment when Novak led 5-4 and had a 0-30 window before sealing the first set in a tense tiebreak. The Italian won 38 points to Djoker’s 37 overall and 81% of points behind his first serve in the opening set, rock-solid numbers. After dropping the first set, I thought Djoker had lost a step as Sinner surged ahead in the second set with an early 4-1 lead. This freed him up on return, and he won 6 of 9 second-serve return points during set two. The break of serve proved unrecoverable, and although Djoker kept it tight enough, Sinner was never close to relinquishing his advantage. He was too fast and too consistent over the one-hour and 37-minute encounter. After the win, Sinner’s celebration was pretty subdued. He’s not one to go crazy anyway, but this was even more toned down. Why? As I said pre-tournament, there are still huge question marks around his two positive doping tests for Clostebol, and he must be aware of what could happen with the WADA appeal. But it’s not just the incident that I find strange; the paid tennis media openly refuse to investigate the case. When was the last time you read any info about it? It has been memory-holed. I am unaware of one mainstream paid journalist who has dug into the nitty gritty of things or even questioned why the ATP or ITIA have not explained their decisions. Instead, they promote Sinner and pretend like nothing has happened. Why? Probably because the pay model for a modern ‘sports journalist’ depends on the game’s success to fill their coffers. “Scoops” mean very little; being the first to put out a little generic quote from a press conference (which you need accreditation for and must be in the good books to obtain) is what they now strive for. It was a very tough match, obviously, playing against Novak is one of the toughest challenges we have. I’m very happy with how I handled the situation. He was serving great in the first set, and I couldn’t find a way to break him. I played a really good tie-break, which gave me confidence to start well in the second set. I’m very happy with my performance throughout this whole tournament. It’s a very special one.” His victory capped off an extraordinary season, further solidifying his dominance on the hard court surface and his place as one of the top players in the world. Sinner on beating Djokovic. Well, I think there are quite a few positives that I can take. First, I think my tennis level was really good in this tournament, probably the best after the Olympic games in terms of how I played, performed, and fought. I did my best tonight. Under the circumstances, I felt maybe not a hundred per cent fresh, but at the same time, enormous credit to Jannik for playing the big points better than me, and that’s what made the difference. He deserved to win; he was just too strong in important moments. Nevertheless, I still think that even in the finals today, I played pretty well, which, you know, gives me, I guess, a reason to believe that I can still play with these guys who are the best in the world at this level. Hopefully, I can maintain that level in the upcoming months, \u0026 also for the future. Djokovic on his week in Shanghai. What did you think of the final? Let me know in the comments.

It has been memory-holed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am unaware of one mainstream paid journalist who has dug into the nitty gritty of things or even questioned why the ATP or ITIA have not explained their decisions. Instead, they promote Sinner and pretend like nothing has happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy? Probably because the pay model for a modern ‘sports journalist’ depends on the game’s success to fill their coffers. “Scoops” mean very little; being the first to put out a little generic quote from a press conference (which you need accreditation for and must be in the good books to obtain) is what they now strive for.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was a very tough match, obviously, playing against Novak is one of the toughest challenges we have. I’m very happy with how I handled the situation. He was serving great in the first set, and I couldn’t find a way to break him. I played a really good tie-break, which gave me confidence to start well in the second set. I’m very happy with my performance throughout this whole tournament. It’s a very special one.” His victory capped off an extraordinary season, further solidifying his dominance on the hard court surface and his place as one of the top players in the world. \u003ccite\u003eSinner on beating Djokovic.\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eWell, I think there are quite a few positives that I can take. First, I think my tennis level was really good in this tournament, probably the best after the Olympic games in terms of how I played, performed, and fought. I did my best tonight. Under the circumstances, I felt maybe not a hundred per cent fresh, but at the same time, enormous credit to Jannik for playing the big points better than me, and that’s what made the difference. He deserved to win; he was just too strong in important moments. Nevertheless, I still think that even in the finals today, I played pretty well, which, you know, gives me, I guess, a reason to believe that I can still play with these guys who are the best in the world at this level. Hopefully, I can maintain that level in the upcoming months, \u0026amp; also for the future.\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ccite\u003eDjokovic on his week in Shanghai.\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat did you think of the final?
