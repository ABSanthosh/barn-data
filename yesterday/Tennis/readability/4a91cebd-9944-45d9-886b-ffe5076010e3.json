The 23-year-old spent nearly seven hours on court Sunday, due to heavy rain all week postponing several matches. Burruchaga won a three-hour, two-minute semi-final against home hope Gustavo Heide before returning to court and winning the second-longest Challenger final in history (three hours, 45 minutes). The Argentine saved a championship point, surviving countryman Facundo Mena 7-6(8), 6-7(6), 7-6(4) to lift the Brasil Tennis Challenger trophy.
