  "text": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Novak Djokovic has won the Miami Open on six previous occasionsNovak Djokovic is safely through to the third round of the Miami Open after a straight-set victory over Australia's Rinky Hijikata.The Serbian fourth seed raced through the first set without dropping a game and although he was made to work harder in the second, still sealed a 6-0 7-6 (7-1) win in a little over an hour and 20 minutes.Djokovic, who received a bye in round one, will face world number 69 Camilo Ugo Carabelli of Argentina in the next round.Build up to the tournament has been dominated by news that the Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA), co-founded by Djokovic, has begun legal action against tennis' governing bodies.However, in his first match in Miami since 2019, the 37-year-old showed no signs of being distracted as Hijikata was swiftly swatted aside.The 24-time Grand Slam champion broke in the second game of the match and never looked back, winning the first set to love in 28 minutes.It was more of a contest in the second, but Djokovic dominated in the tie-break to move a step closer to a seventh Miami Open title.\"I was playing really well, I mean on a very high level from the beginning, I knew exactly what I wanted to do tactically,\" he said.\"Obviously it's just the first match but the way I felt on the court and the way I played is really encouraging.\"Medvedev out but Ruud and Dimitrov advanceSeventh seed Daniil Medvedev was beaten 6-2 6-3 by Spain's Jaume Munar.The 2023 champion made 31 unforced errors as he was brushed aside by world number 56 Munar.Casper Ruud also had a scare, but the Norwegian came from a set down to claim a 3-6 6-4 6-4 victory over Serbia's Miomir Kecmanovic.Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov saw off Federico Cina of Italy in straight sets, winning 6-1 6-4 but, having claimed his first win since 2022 earlier this week, Australia's Nick Kyrgios lost 7-6 (7-3) 6-0 to Karen Khachanov.More on this story",
