He smashed an ace but then hit a double fault of his own on match point.Munar made him pay this time to force a deciding set.After Alcaraz went 2-0 up, the French Open champion was broken in his next two service games and Munar went into a 4-2 lead.Alcaraz, however, was not done yet, and two more breaks of serve sealed a hard-earned victory as he continued his preparations for Wimbledon, where the Spaniard will be aiming to complete a hat-trick of triumphs.\"I'm proud of the level I showed today. It's my second match on grass this year,\" Alcaraz said.\"There were moments I struggled a lot mentally and physically. I still don't know how I'm standing here. But I'm really happy I've given myself another chance in the quarter-finals.\"Alcaraz will face French lucky loser Arthur Rinderknech after his 7-5 7-6(3) win over American Reilly Opelka. Rinderknech has lost both previous meetings with Alcaraz, the last loss coming at Queen's in 2023.Elsewhere in the Queen's Club draw. British number two Jacob Fearnley reached his first ATP Tour quarterfinal with a 6-3 2-6 6-2 win over French qualifier Corentin Moutet.\"I'm very happy to be in my first quarterfinal, it's even better to do it here in the UK,\" Fearnley said.\"I tried to stick to my game plan and be aggressive. I did that better in the third set and the result speaks for itself.\"Fearnley raced into a 3-0 lead, and while Moutet broke back, the Briton responded immediately with another break of his own to ease through the first set.Moutet did likewise in the second, sailing 3-0 ahead before breaking for a second time to clinch the set and force the decider, where Fearnley broke twice before holding serve to love to clinch victory in style.The 23-year-old will now face Jiri Lehecka after the Czech beat Canada's Gabriel Diallo 6-4 6-2.",
