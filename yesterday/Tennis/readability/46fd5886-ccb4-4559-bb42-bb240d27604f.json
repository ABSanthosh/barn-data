  "description": "Two years ago Taylor Fritz made his debut at the Nitto ATP Finals and advanced to the semi-finals. On Sunday, the American will try to cap his second appearance in the season finale with a trophy. But the fifth seed will face a big challenge in the final at the Inalpi Arena when he stands across the net from top seed Jannik Sinner. It is a rematch of both this year’s US Open final and a clash from Group Ilie Nastase play earlier this week. “I thought the match here was actually even a higher level from both guys. Jannik is extremely even-keeled,” Fritz’s coach, Michael Russell, told ATPTour.com. “He’s just so calm under pressure and explosive out of the corners. He’s very agile and able to turn defence into offence better than most of the guys on Tour, which makes it challenging. “But Taylor knows that and Taylor, when he serves how he can serve with high percentages, it puts so much pressure on his opponents. He has a lot of confidence and he’s hitting the ball great.” Watch Fritz Turin SF Highlights: In recent years Fritz has experienced a lot of firsts. In Indian Wells two years ago he claimed his maiden ATP Masters 1000 trophy and just two months ago he made his first major final at the US Open. What has he learned from those big-match experiences, especially his recent effort in New York? “I think a lot of it is managing emotions and also having confidence, vanquishing any self doubt,” Russell said. “We all talk about being in finals of major events, but then actually being able to do it, that gives you the confidence from having that experience and putting yourself in those positions time and time again. You get more comfortable every time you’re on the court in that situation.” The score in the US Open final was 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 in favour of Sinner. But in the match Fritz served for the third set and had a chance to push the encounter into a fourth set, so he had opportunities. Since then, the eight-time ATP Tour titlist has made the semi-finals in Shanghai and now the final in Turin. “We’re all proud of the way that he’s conducted himself and the work that he’s putting in and it’s a constant process,” Russell said. “It doesn’t stop. It never stops. You’ve got to continue to put the work in and [follow] the process and the progress and the results will come.” [ATP AWARDS] Regardless of the result Sunday, Fritz will leave Turin having broken new ground. He will climb to a career-high No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings on Monday and become the first American to finish in the year-end top four since James Blake was No. 4 in 2006. “It’s fantastic. To start the year outside of the Top 10 and then finish the year [at No.] 4, it’s a phenomenal achievement,” Russell said. “Credit to Taylor and the team for really improving, continuing to improve, continuing to progress. “He’s put in a lot of hard work and to make the final of the US Open, to be in the final here, to win multiple 250 events, it’s not easy. It’s a long year, its a lot of travel, there’s a lot of adversity to deal with and he’s just done a really remarkable job of being mature and dealing with those variables.” Two years ago, Fritz was new to the Nitto ATP Finals scene, and making the semi-finals was a breakthrough in itself. Now the 27-year-old has a chance to cause a big upset and stun the Italian crowd for the biggest title of his career. “He’s definitely more confident in his abilities and that parlays into not just playing on court, but the fitness part, the mental toughness, the resilience,” Russell said. “He’s always been a great competitor, but now he’s seeing the results. That leads to a new level of confidence when you’re in those pressure moments — the belief to go for certain shots, to hit certain serves, to be able to take the racquet out of your opponent’s hand. “That’s the difference of Taylor in 2024 compared to Taylor in 2022.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
