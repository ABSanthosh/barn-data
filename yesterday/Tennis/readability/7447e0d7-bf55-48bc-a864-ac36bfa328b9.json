  "description": "Tallon Griekspoor settled back in quickly to indoor conditions on Tuesday at the Open Occitanie in Montpellier. The Dutchman overcame countryman Botic van de Zandschulp 7-5, 6-3 in a topsy-turvy 95-minute battle. Now with 24 indoor wins since the start of the 2023 season, Griekspoor trails only the No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Jannik Sinner (33) for most on the ATP Tour. “I’ve always played well here, felt well… I like the conditions,” said Griekspoor. “I like a roof above my head, the same as Rotterdam next week. It’s perfect for me to be here, first win of the season, a great day so far. “It’s very not easy to play each other, we practise together every day when we’re back home in Amsterdam. We know each other better than anyone else I guess, so that also makes it very tricky. I don’t think we played our best match, but that’s what happens when you know each other so well.” Griekspoor squandered a break lead in both sets, but made amends with his clinical performance at the net. The fifth seed won 18 of 24 points when at the forecourt, according to Infosys ATP Stats, en route to improving to 2-1 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Van de Zandschulp. Awaiting the Dutchman in the second round is three-time champion Richard Gasquet, who prevailed 6-3, 6-2 in an all-French clash with Adrian Mannarino. It was a record-extending 29th main-draw win in Montpellier for Gasquet, who has announced he will retire after Roland Garros this year. “It’s always special to play against a friend. We are used to it. I’ve played many times against a French player,\" said Gasquet after his 76-minute victory. \"It’s a little bit different, and my last time here in Montpellier so of course I’m really happy to win. \"I hope Adrian will win in the future, but I’m really happy with how I played. It’s really important for me to play another match. I really like to play here, I won many times, so I’m really happy to play here again.” In other action in Montpellier, Christopher Eubanks battled past qualifier Alibek Kachmazov 7-5 6-4 to set up a meeting with top seed Andrey Rublev. Frenchman Constant Lestienne rallied back from 2-5 in the second set to defeat Borna Coric 6-3, 7-5, and Mattia Bellucci defeated 2018 champion Lucas Pouille 6-4, 6-4. In an all-French matchup, seventh seed Arthur Rinderknech eliminated Harold Mayot 7-6(2), 2-6, 6-1 in two hours and 10 minutes. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
