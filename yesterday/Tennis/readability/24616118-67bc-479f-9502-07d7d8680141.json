Just 13 days removed from his triumph at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, the Brazilian returned to the winner's circle Saturday at the ATP Challenger Tour 125 event in Canberra, Australia. Fonseca downed American Ethan Quinn 6-4, 6-4 in the Workday Canberra International final, extending his match winning streak to 10. Only one other past Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion won his next event at any level: Jannik Sinner, currently No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings.

The #NextGenATP star turned pro in February, shortly after his dream run in Rio de Janeiro, where backed by home support, Fonseca became the second-youngest ATP 500 quarter-finalist since the series began in 2009. The teenager‚Äôs first Challenger title came in August, when he triumphed in Lexington, Kentucky to become the youngest Brazilian champion at that level. Fonseca was dominant en route to both Challenger title runs, not dropping a set in either Lexington or Canberra.
