  "text": "With the third round wrapping up, Day Six at Wimbledon saw the top contenders make powerful statements as the tournament heads into the business end. Rain made a brief return to SW19, suspending play on the outside courts around 11:50 a.m. and delaying the schedule until just after 1:30 p.m. BST. But once the action resumed, it was largely one-way traffic as the top seeds cruised into the second week. Sinner has dropped just 17 games through three rounds, Djokovic barely broke a sweat against Kecmanovic, and Flavio Cobolli continued his run with a dominant win over Jakub Mensik. Marin Cilic continued his resurgence with another steady victory. Meanwhile, Grigor Dimitrov and Alex de Minaur impressed with straight-set wins, and Ben Shelton powered through his third-round test in style. Full recap below. Day Six Wimbledon 2025 Round of 32 Results Winner Loser Scoreline Jannik Sinner (1) Pedro Martinez 6-1 6-3 6-1 Grigor Dimitrov (19) Sebastian Ofner 6-3 6-4 7-6(0) Ben Shelton (10) Marton Fucsovics (LL) 6-3 7-6(4) 6-2 Lorenzo Sonego Brandon Nakashima (29) 6-7(5) 7-6(8) 7-6(2) 3-6 7-6(10-3) Marin Cilic Jaume Munar 6-3 3-6 6-2 6-4 Flavio Cobolli (22) Jakub Mensik 6-2 6-4 6-2 Alex de Minaur (11) August Holmgren 6-4 7-6(5) 6-3 Novak Djokovic (6) Miomir Kecmanovic 6-3 6-0 6-4 Sinner Cruises Into Last Sixteen Top seed Jannik Sinner cruised into the Wimbledon fourth round for the fourth straight year, defeating Pedro Martinez 6-1, 6-3, 6-1 in 1 hour and 55 minutes. Sinner has cruised so far, dropping just seventeen games, and nobody has got anywhere close to taking a set off him.  Martinez isn’t a player to fear on the grass at the best of times, and the fact that a right shoulder issue further hampered him means it was never competitive, as he wasn’t even able to clock 100mph on serve. Sinner next faces Grigor Dimitrov after the Bulgarian came through Sebastian Ofner. Neither of them has been tested, and although Grigor will be Sinner’s toughest opponent so far, I am not sure he’s up to causing an upset in the face-off against Sinner’s machine-like ball striking. I’m very happy to be in the second week, but I think we all saw he was struggling with his shoulder. He couldn’t serve very well, and especially on this surface, if you can’t serve well, it’s not easy to play. But huge credit to him for coming out. From my side, I tried to stay solid from the back of the court. I feel like I haven’t won anything compared to you. For us athletes, it’s very nice when we see new faces because we are not used to playing in front of such special guests, so thank you for watching. Sinner on his win. Djokovic Dismantles Kecmanovic  Novak Djokovic secured his 100th Wimbledon match win, defeating fellow Serbian Miomir Kecmanovic 6-3, 6-0, 6-4 in 1 hour and 47 minutes to reach the fourth round for the 17th time. Novak has looked sharp so far and he dominated baseline rallies and even produced some deft volleys, a shot which he’s improved 10 fold over the last few years. Next  he faces Alex de Minaur next after the Australian’s 6-4, 7-6(5), 6-3 win over qualifier August Holmgren. De Minaur has the court coverage and foot speed to test Novak but I still think on grass he’s going to have the edge with the way he moves and puts points together. I am very grateful, privileged to be in the position that I am. I have said it many times. Tennis made me who I am. It has given me things in life that I can experience. I try not to take anything for granted, particularly at this age. I’m still going strong, trying to compete with the young players and do some slides and some splits on the court. Wimbledon is a favourite tournament and dream tournament of not just myself but probably the majority of tennis players. Growing up most of the kids dream of playing here and winning here and I am blessed to have done it multiple times. Any history that I make at my favourite tournament, I am blessed. Djokovic on his 100th win. Other Notable Matches Flavio Cobolli def. Jakub Mensik 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 Flavio Cobolli delivered a commanding performance to defeat Jakub Mensik 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 and make the fourth round for the first time at a Grand Slam. Cobolli, who had not dropped a set in his prior matches against Beibit Zhukayev (6-3, 7-6(7), 6-1) and Jack Pinnington Jones (6-1, 7-6(6), 6-2), dominated throughout, breaking early in each set and never look back. Surprisingly, Mensik was the betting favourite (significant value on Cobolli if you got on early enough), but I don’t think he looked convincing in his opening two rounds, and if he wasn’t able to win points immediately after landing a first serve, then he quickly ran out of ideas. Alex de Minaur def. August Holmgren 6-4, 7-6(5), 6-3 11th seed Alex de Minaur advanced to the Wimbledon fourth round with a 6-4, 7-6(5), 6-3 victory over Danish qualifier August Holmgren on Court 2. Holmgren has had a great tournament and he was again competitive, forcing a tie break in the second set but De Minaur’s baseline consistency prevailed. It was a typical gritty type performance from him  and his speed is a nightmare for opponents. Marin Cilic def. Jaume Munar 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 Marin Cilic continued his run, defeating Jaume Munar 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 on Court 18. Cilic. He broke early to capture the first but faced resistance as Munar leveled the match in the second. Cilic’s experience shone in the third and fourth, saving break points to consolidate for 4-2 and maintaining his lead. He now faces 22nd seed Flavio Cobolli, aiming for his first Wimbledon quarterfinal since 2017.

Wimbledon is a favourite tournament and dream tournament of not just myself but probably the majority of tennis players. Growing up most of the kids dream of playing here and winning here and I am blessed to have done it multiple times. Any history that I make at my favourite tournament, I am blessed. \u003ccite\u003eDjokovic on his 100th win.\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eOther Notable Matches\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/wimbledon-recap.avif\" alt=\"wimbledon recap\" width=\"1400\" height=\"933\" srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/wimbledon-recap.avif 1400w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/wimbledon-recap-300x200.avif 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/wimbledon-recap-1024x682.avif 1024w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/wimbledon-recap-768x512.avif 768w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/wimbledon-recap-150x100.avif 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%201400%20933\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\"/\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFlavio Cobolli def.
