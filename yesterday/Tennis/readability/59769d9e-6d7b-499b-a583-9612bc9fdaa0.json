  "text": "Day three at the Miami Open brought the big guns out to play—and two of them got sent packing. Jaume Munar’s 6-2, 6-3 dismantling of former champ Daniil Medvedev was on the cards for those who’ve tracked the Spaniard’s hard-court surge this season, but David Goffin turning the tables on second seed Carlos Alcaraz with a 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 upset? That was a big surprise as the 34-year-old Belgian reminded everyone he can still cause the elite problems. Add in Novak Djokovic’s rock-solid return to capture his 410th ATP M1000 win, Gael Monfils defying Father Time, and a few gritty comebacks, Friday’s play was the best yet. Full results and highlights below. Day Two 2025 Miami Open Round of 64 Results Winner Loser Scoreline Jaume Munar Daniil Medvedev (7) 6-2 6-3 Gael Monfils Jiri Lehecka (26) 6-1 3-6 7-6(8) Sebastian Korda (24) Elliot Spizziri (WC) 6-4 6-2 Stefanos Tsitsipas (9) Chun Hsin Tseng (Q) 4-6 7-5 6-3 Lorenzo Musetti (15) Quentin Halys 3-6 7-6(4) 7-5 Felix Auger-Aliassime (18) Tristan Schoolkate (Q) 6-4 6-4 Alex Michelsen (32) Camilo Ugo Carabelli (LL) 6-7(3) 7-5 6-3 Novak Djokovic (4) Rinky Hijikata 6-0 7-6(1) Casper Ruud (5) Miomir Kecmanovic 3-6 6-4 6-4 Alejandro Tabilo (30) Corentin Moutet 5-7 6-3 7-5 Francisco Cerundolo (23) Alexandre Muller 6-1 6-2 Tommy Paul (12) Alexander Bublik 5-7 7-5 6-4 Grigor Dimitrov (14) Federico Cina (WC 6-1 6-4 Karen Khachanov Nick Kyrgios 7-6(3) 6-0 Brandon Nakashima (31) Roberto Carballes Baena 6-4 4-6 6-3 David Goffin Carlos Alcaraz (2) 5-7 6-4 6-3 Goffin Ousts Alcaraz David Goffin landed the surprise of day three by turning over Carlos Alcaraz on Friday night at the Miami Open. Recording a 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 victory, Goffin capitalised on 43 unforced errors (28 off that forehand) from the former champion, who has issues responding to bad losses after his lacklustre performance in Indian Wells. Goffin, now 2-1 in H2H with Alcaraz, brought plenty of determination and his typical crisp flat ball striking, leading by a break in every set and making them count in the final two. Alcaraz, meanwhile, unravelled. That forehand, a liability against Draper in Indian Wells, betrayed him again, and Goffin took full advantage. His tennis has regressed recently, so I am unsure what the plan will be. Will he continue to tweak his serve and backhand and opt for short-term pain for long-term gain? Next up for Goffin is Brandon Nakashima, who battled past Carballes Baena 6-4, 4-6, 6-3. It feels amazing. Sometimes some matches are tough and you have to fight, like the first round, and you’re happy to have a second round like that in a stadium. That’s why I continue to play tennis, to have that kind of match in a stadium, to play some good tennis. [I was] just trying to enjoy the moment… I felt that physically I was ready to fight and then I was feeling the ball really well, so it’s the kind of night that you feel great and you’re happy to fight, you enjoy every point and at the end it’s it’s a perfect end with a great match point. It was amazing. Goffin on his win. Munar Mauls Medvedev Jaume Munar pulled off the second biggest upset of the day at the Miami Open by toppling former champ Daniil Medvedev 6-2, 6-3 in just 78 minutes. You do not want to see Munar in your section of the draw. Although he has lacked prominent wins, he’s performed well on hard courts this season, culminating in Medvedev’s scalp. The Spaniard was far too strong for the back-hobbled Medvedev, keeping his cool to save two break points while serving it out.  Medvedev, meanwhile, was a shadow of his 2023 Miami-winning self. Taped up and nursing a lingering back issue, he’s gone from almost insuperable to anyone outside the top 10 to highly vulnerable. It means a lot. I am feeling great after all the work I have put in to have a tournament like this. I feel really comfortable here and I have been playing great this year on hard courts. It got a little bit tight at the end but I am happy with the performance and it means a lot. I’ve been changing a lot. I changed techniques, tactics. It has been working very well this year. I think I have to keep improving to keep changing things. To look where my game can improve and I think me and my team are doing very well. Munar on his win. Djokovic Delivers in Miami Novak Djokovic levelled Rafael Nadal’s mark of 410 ATP Masters 1000 match wins with a 6-0, 7-6(1) demolition of Rinky Hijikata. The six-time champ was in vintage form, snapping a rare three-match losing streak. Even when the Aussie found his feet in a tighter second set, Djokovic flipped the switch, reeling off six straight points in the tiebreak to seal it in 80 minutes. Based on what I’ve seen from Djokovic this season, I wasn’t too worried about his form, as it feels just like a matter of time before he finds his groove. Is it here in Miami? Maybe. Next up: lucky loser Camilo Ugo Carabelli, who fought past Alex Michelsen 6-7(3), 7-5, 6-3.  I was playing really well, at a very high level from the beginning. I knew exactly what I wanted to do tactically. I played him in the first match of the season in Brisbane. So I think it was good to do some homework, look at those videos. I know that the stats and the metrics have not been that great for me post Australia. Obviously it took me a little bit more time after an injury to really find that groove, find that movement, that rhythm, that striking zone. I love the way I was practising actually the last seven to 10 days and had some great, great sessions on this court as well. I’m obviously excited to compete to keep on playing at the highest level when I play this way. Obviously it’s always a pleasure when you come back to an amazing city like Miami after six years of absence and I’ve had this many people in the first match, so I’m really, really grateful for their support. Djokovic on his win over Hijikata. Other Matches of Note Gael Monfils saved a match point to outlast 26th seed Jiri Lehecka 6-1, 3-6, 7-6(8). At 38, fresh off becoming the second-oldest Miami match-winner against Marozsan, the Frenchman delivered yet again to book his spot in the third round. Elsewhere, Stefanos Tsitsipas dodged a bullet. The World No. 10, who looked back in form after Dubai, stared down a set-and-a-break deficit against qualifier Chun-Hsin Tseng before clawing back for a 4-6, 7-5, 6-3 win. He’s got Sebastian Korda in the next round after he defeated Elliot Spizziri. Nick Kyrgios’ second-round defeat came at the hands of Khachanov, who produced a clean, powerful display to take him out 7-6(3) 6-0. Rusty is not quite ready to go the distance with the 22nd seed. Casper Ruud had to dig deep to overcome Kecmanovic in a two-hour, six-minute battle, marking his first ATP Masters 1000 win since Montreal 2024. Kecmanovic will rue a Djokosmash he produced when he had a break point late in the second set, but Ruud picked up his level and’ll face Alejandro Tabilo in the third round.

Although he has lacked prominent wins, he’s performed well on hard courts this season, culminating in Medvedev’s scalp. The Spaniard was far too strong for the back-hobbled Medvedev, keeping his cool to save two break points while serving it out. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMedvedev, meanwhile, was a shadow of his 2023 Miami-winning self. Taped up and nursing a lingering back issue, he’s gone from almost insuperable to anyone outside the top 10 to highly vulnerable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt means a lot. I am feeling great after all the work I have put in to have a tournament like this. I feel really comfortable here and I have been playing great this year on hard courts. It got a little bit tight at the end but I am happy with the performance and it means a lot. I’ve been changing a lot. I changed techniques, tactics. It has been working very well this year.

Is it here in Miami? Maybe.

I knew exactly what I wanted to do tactically. I played him in the first match of the season in Brisbane. So I think it was good to do some homework, look at those videos. I know that the stats and the metrics have not been that great for me post Australia. Obviously it took me a little bit more time after an injury to really find that groove, find that movement, that rhythm, that striking zone. I love the way I was practising actually the last seven to 10 days and had some great, great sessions on this court as well. I’m obviously excited to compete to keep on playing at the highest level when I play this way. Obviously it’s always a pleasure when you come back to an amazing city like Miami after six years of absence and I’ve had this many people in the first match, so I’m really, really grateful for their support. \u003ccite\u003eDjokovic on his win over Hijikata.\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eOther Matches of Note\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/miami-open-2023-seeds.jpg\" alt=\"miami open schedule\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/miami-open-2023-seeds.jpg 1200w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/miami-open-2023-seeds-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/miami-open-2023-seeds-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/miami-open-2023-seeds-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/miami-open-2023-seeds-150x100.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%201200%20801\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/miami-open-2023-seeds.jpg 1200w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/miami-open-2023-seeds-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/miami-open-2023-seeds-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/miami-open-2023-seeds-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/miami-open-2023-seeds-150x100.jpg 150w\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/miami-open-2023-seeds.jpg\"/\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\n\u003cp\u003eGael Monfils saved a match point to outlast 26th seed Jiri Lehecka 6-1, 3-6, 7-6(8).
