Britain's Raducanu, 22, was deliberating whether to travel to the United States for the hard-court event which starts next week.The former US Open champion was shaken after a man \"exhibited fixated behaviour\" towards her at last week's Dubai Tennis Championships.The man was later detained and given a restraining order, Dubai Police said. Raducanu was visibly upset after seeing the man in the stands during her second-round match last week.The BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells begins on 5 March.The Californian event is one of the biggest tournaments of the season outside of the four Grand Slams, with the world's best men and women competing in a combined ATP/WTA event over a fortnight.Raducanu had direct entry into the 128-player women's singles field having climbed up to 55th in the world rankings.Last year, the British number two was given a wildcard as she fought back from wrist and ankle surgeries which ruled her out of most of the 2023 season. Raducanu is likely to be flanked by increased security at the event.The WTA, whose full-time security arm is led by former US Secret Service agent Bob Campbell, says it can provide enhanced security if a player has been the target of a credible threat.Players are usually escorted to and from the match court by at least one security officer.But the Dubai incident raised questions about the security measures in place to protect players.Raducanu had spotted the man in the first few rows of the stand during her match against Karolina Muchova.A day before, Raducanu was approached by the same man in a public area close to the tournament.Police said he gave the 2021 US Open champion a letter, which sources told BBC Sport included his name and telephone number, and took a photograph.After raising her concerns with the WTA, the tournament's security team were informed and told to be on alert.However, the man was still able to enter the small stadium where Raducanu played later that evening.More on this story",
