  "description": "It can be easy to forget that Jannik Sinner is just 23 years old. Still early in his career, the Italian has compiled a lengthy list of achievements. He’s held No. 1 honours in the PIF ATP Rankings since last June, won eight of his 18 tour-level trophies in the past 12 months and lost just one of his past 37 matches. A relentless competitor boasting ice-cold composure, Sinner’s next task is to defend his Australian Open title Sunday, when he battles Alexander Zverev in the final. Beyond Sinner’s accolades, one key component has earned the praise of his coaches Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi: the Italian’s maturity. “I know he's just 23 years of age, but sometimes it feels like he's much older and wiser than what we are,” Cahill said during a press conference Friday in Melbourne. “He's an incredible young man. It's no surprise to us to see him back in the final. I think that his level has been great for a long time now, but his level here in Australia is even better.”Post-match under the city lights 🌃#AO2025 | @janniksin pic.twitter.com/vBAMPiiwof— ATP Tour (@atptour) January 24, 2025 Balancing the demands of a top-tier tennis career with the joys of youth is not an easy task. Sinner’s team has seen firsthand his growth, while also reminding their charge to embrace life’s lighter moments. “He's matured, for sure,” said Cahill. “I think there are many areas of not just what he's doing on the court but certainly off the court, as well. “All these young kids, they are living a life that is great, but you have to have a wise head on your shoulders dealing with the media and the fans and the pressure of playing in front of 15,000 people and living up to expectations. You grow up fast. Jannik is one of those. “So I think there's many areas where we talk to him about making sure that he still remains a 23-year-old. He's still a young man that needs to enjoy life, enjoy the people around him, have his friends, go out and have a good time.” Perhaps those off-court moments have created a necessary balance, allowing Sinner to excel under the bright lights. “I think Jannik likes this situation, the pressure point, to be in a storm, in a difficult moment,” said Vagnozzi when reflecting on Sinner’s 7-6(2), 6-2, 6-2 semi-final victory against American Ben Shelton. “So in this moment, he [plays] the best tennis.” Sinner will put his 20-match winning streak on the line against Zverev, who the Italian trails 2-4 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Sinner is aiming for his third major crown while the 27-year-old Zverev seeks his first. “Alexander has been around, doing this for years. He's going to be a really tough opponent for Jannik. We can't wait to see how it goes,” Cahill said. “I think it's going to be a great match. Different challenges come from different opponents. Getting Zverev's serve back is going to be a challenge in itself. “It's the number one and two in the world, so it's the perfect final as far as the rankings are concerned. A great challenge for both players.”[NEWSLETTER FORM]",
