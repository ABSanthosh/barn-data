Draper had not played for a month before this week, having pulled out of Shanghai as a precaution with an abdominal injury suffered the week before in Tokyo.That came after he raised concerns about the scheduling demands put on players.\"I feel really good. I didn't know what to expect coming out after being injured and I was ill for a week,\" said Draper, who plays Czech Tomas Machac next.\"Potentially I was going to be rusty and not feeling good but I've been really strong.\"Looking refreshed and sharp, Draper had to be patient before wearing down Darderi.Draper broke serve for a 6-5 lead and fired down four aces in the next game to seal the opening set, having won all 21 points on first serve.In the second set Draper continued to play aggressively and confidently as a frustrated Darderi unravelled.More on this story",
