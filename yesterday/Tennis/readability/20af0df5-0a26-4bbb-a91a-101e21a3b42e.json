We have both played some really tough matches this week and he was just too strong for me in the third set.It is Rublev's second Qatar Open title after lifting the trophy in 2020, the first time he has won the same event on two occasions.\"It is amazing. It is the first title I have won twice so I am really happy,\" said Rublev.\"We were both exhausted after some long matches this week. It was difficult but we were able to play to a good level.\"After the second set, I started to play much more free - he was more tired. I was able to break him and the match changed completely.\"Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool cruised to victory in the men's doubles final against fellow Britons Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski.Cash and Glasspool needed just 62 minutes to seal a 6-3 6-2 win and a third ATP Tour doubles title, following victories in Tokyo and Brisbane.The pair only made their debut together in September and are now up to third in the ATP doubles team rankings.\"We really enjoyed our time here. Lloyd and I put a lot of effort in and it's kind of showing early in the year, which is nice,\" said Cash. \"Hopefully we can keep improving and get some bigger titles down the road.\"Glasspool said: \"I try to have low expectations [about the rest of 2025], honestly. Just try to keep working hard, have belief in our level and trust it, and see what happens. If you put that hard work, eventually it should hopefully show at some point.\"",
