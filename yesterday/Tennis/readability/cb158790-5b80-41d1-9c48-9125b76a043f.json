  "text": "A \"free and expressive\" Emma Raducanu began her grass-court singles campaign with an impressive straight-set victory over Spanish qualifier Cristina Bucsa at Queen's.The Briton needed just one hour and five minutes to breeze past world number 112 Bucsa 6-1 6-2 and clearly relished the occasion in front of a home crowd at the west London tournament.\"Going on to the court laughing at certain shots, or I'm smiling if I have pulled off a great shot, it does help relax you,\" Raducanu said.\"I play my best when my personality is put on the court and I can express myself, and I feel like sometimes when I've been constrained to play a certain way, it hasn't necessarily worked.\"I just need to be free and expressive, and then certain moments of creativity can come up.\"For now at least, victory places Raducanu above compatriot Katie Boulter in the live rankings and could spell the end of Boulter's almost two-year reign as British number one, depending on how they each perform this week.Boulter booked her place in the last 16 earlier on Tuesday but is defending ranking points at the tournament, the first women's Tour event at Queen's since 1973.She overcame a stern test against Australian qualifier Ajla Tomljanovic, winning 7-6 (7-4) 1-6 6-4 in the end, after Heather Watson beat Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva 6-4 6-3 to set up a last-16 meeting with fourth seed Elena Rybakina.Wildcard Francesca Jones could not make it a British clean sweep on day two as she was beaten 6-2 6-4 by American McCartney Kessler.Raducanu has experienced a difficult 12 months.Left feeling \"wary\" after being targeted by a stalker during a match in Dubai, she has also had a period of uncertainty with frequent changes to her coaches and a series of back problems that have at times kept her sidelined.But the 2021 US Open champion has started this grass-court season with a more familiar and stable set-up, including the return to her team of coach Nick Cavaday.She has also been \"managing\" the back issues and looked physically and mentally at ease in her maiden singles match at Queen's.Raducanu has played down her expectations at the tournament but, having got a feel for the grass alongside Boulter in their doubles victory on Monday, quickly made herself at home to the delight of a partisan crowd.Cries of \"Emma, we love you!\" could be heard from fans throughout, while Raducanu returned the love by cheering and smiling towards the crowd after winning points and signing the camera lens \"home turf\" with a smiley face after her victory.The heavily scrutinised Raducanu would surely benefit from a run at a tournament where she has quickly become comfortable, but tougher tasks lie ahead.She will next face Rebecca Sramkova, who beat reigning Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova 6-4 6-3.Krejcikova is on the comeback trail after a serious back problem sidelined her for six monthsBoulter navigated a tricky match filled with twists and turns against Tomljanovic in her first singles match of the season on grass.The 28-year-old came through a tense deciding set to book a last-16 meeting with fifth seed Diana Shnaider.But, having slipped in the rankings this year while Raducanu has quietly crept back up, Boulter could end the tournament having lost her status as Britain's leading woman, which she has held since June 2023.The two have paired up for the doubles event at Queen's and Boulter said she is happy to see Raducanu pushing her for top spot in the singles.\"Obviously, it holds a massive privilege being that person, but as I have said for the last two years which I have held that position, I'm not focused on necessarily that. I'm focused on myself and keeping my ranking up where I want it to be,\" Boulter said.The pair are on opposite sides of the draw at Queen's, meaning they could not meet until the final.But Raducanu will need to equal or better Boulter's run to regain her status as British number one, a position she held following her 2021 US Open win until Boulter took over.The 22-year-old was keen to play down the significance of the rankings.\"The tournament is still young and Katie can go on a rip this week as well. Honestly, it's nice in a way having something to chase at one, but we have such a great relationship that it's a very healthy competition,\" she said.Raducanu and Boulter will set the friendly domestic rivalry aside on Wednesday when they team up to take on top seeds Lyudmyla Kichenok and Erin Routliffe in the doubles after the top-seeded pair from Ukraine and New Zealand beat Britain's Kartal and Jodie Burrage 7-6 (10-8) 7-6 (7-1).",
