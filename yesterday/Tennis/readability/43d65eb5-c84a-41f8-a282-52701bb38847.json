  "text": "Draper out of season-opening event in AustraliaImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jack Draper has reached a career high of 15th in the world British number one Jack Draper will miss the first event of the 2025 season with a hip injury but is \"very positive\" about competing at the Australian Open.The 22-year-old cancelled a training camp with four-time major champion Carlos Alcaraz in Spain this week because of a \"little bit of a niggle\".Draper says he has now been advised not to play for Great Britain in the United Cup team competition - starting against Argentina in Sydney on 30 December - and will also sit out the Davis Cup tie in Japan in late January.The Australian Open starts in Melbourne on 12 January.\"As I work to get on top of my hip injury and get match fit, I have unfortunately been advised not to play in the United Cup,\" he said in a message posted on his social media channels.\"While we are very positive about competing in the Australian Open this year, I know I won't be able to jump straight into a packed schedule as I manage and strengthen my hip.\"I'm gutted as I was really looking forward to playing in the United Cup for the first time.\"Draper has risen to number 15 in the world after winning ATP titles in Stuttgart and Vienna and reaching the semi-finals of the US Open in a breakout 2024 season.He will now spend Christmas in the UK before flying to Melbourne at the end of the month. He is not expected to play any events leading into the Australian Open.\"Together with [captain] Leon [Smith], we have also made the difficult decision for me to sit out the upcoming Davis Cup match in Japan in order to give me the opportunity post-Australian Open to complete the rehab and strengthening of my hip,\" he added.That could open the door for 23-year-old Jacob Fearnley to make his Davis Cup debut in his first full year on tour.In the absence of Draper, Fearnley - the world number 99 after a rapid rise up the ATP rankings this year - would be the second highest-ranked British singles player available.Cameron Norrie, ranked 49th in the world, could also make his return to the squad after missing September's round-robin event, where Britain were unable to secure a place in November's knockout stage.More on this story",
