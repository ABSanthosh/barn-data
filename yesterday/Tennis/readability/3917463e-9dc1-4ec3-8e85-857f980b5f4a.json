  "description": "Entering the Roland Garros final on Sunday, only two men had saved championship point en route to a Grand Slam title in the Open Era. Carlos Alcaraz made it three, joining¬†Gaston Gaudio and Novak Djokovic. The Spaniard had never rallied from two sets down in his career, but the No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings picked the perfect time for a first. The 22-year-old saved three championship points and battled past World No. 1 Jannik Sinner 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(2) in a showdown that will never be forgotten. \"The match [is] not finished until he wins the last point. It [was] just one point away from losing the match. But a lot of times people came back from match point down in [the] final of a Grand Slam or even in other matches,\" Alcaraz said. \"So I just wanted to be one of those players who saved match point in the Grand Slam final and ended up winning. \"I just believe all the time. I never have doubts about myself, even [on] those match points down. I thought, 'Just one point at a time'. Just one point and then after [another] point and then try to save that game and keep believing. That's what I thought.\" CARLOS TO-DO LIST üìù Come back from two sets down: ‚úÖ Save 3 championship points: ‚úÖ Defend title ‚úÖ SIMPLY. ON. ANOTHER.

Coria served for the title at 6-5 in the deciding set and earned two championship points, but made a backhand error and a forehand error, which allowed Gaudio to surge to a 0-6, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1, 8-6 victory. Djokovic turned the tables on Roger Federer in the 2019 Wimbledon final. The Swiss served for the championship at 8-7 in the fifth set, but let slip his opportunities to lift the trophy by pushing a forehand wide before Djokovic hit a perfect forehand passing shot for a winner on Federer's second chance. The Serbian eventually triumphed 7-6(5), 1-6, 7-6(4), 4-6, 13-12(3). The big difference in the Alcaraz-Sinner match is that Sinner did not earn championship point on his serve, nor were his chances in the deciding set. The Italian had three opportunities at 5-3 in the fourth set with Alcaraz serving to stay in the match. Learn about how Alcaraz saved the three championship points. This was the second-longest Grand Slam final in the Open Era. The longest was the scintillating five-hour, 53-minute duel between Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal in the 2012 Australian Open final, won by Djokovic. The third-longest major final was at the Australian Open in 2022, when Rafael Nadal rallied from two sets down to stun Daniil Medvedev in five hours and 24 minutes. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
