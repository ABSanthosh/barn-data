  "description": "Much has been made at Wimbledon about Carlos Alcaraz's series of golf matches against fellow former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings Andy Murray. It appears the two-time defending champion at the grass-court major has a new challenger: Tom Holland The actor paid a visit to Alcaraz's practice court Tuesday before the Spaniard's quarter-final wub against Cameron Norrie. But while the stars are at SW19 for tennis, the conversation quickly turned to golf. \"Tom! I saw you playing golf as well. Good swing, good swing, eh?\" Alcaraz called out to the actor in a video published by the tournament on social media. \"We should play!\" Holland quickly responded. Alcaraz agreed, but for the time being, the Spaniard was focused on taking a 5-2 Lexus ATP Head2Head series lead against Norrie and continuing his pursuit of a third consecutive Wimbledon trophy. Holland is an avid tennis fan, who attended last year's BNP Paribas Open final at Indian Wells with partner Zendaya. The winner of that match? Alcaraz. After Alcaraz eased past Norrie in straight sets, he was excited to talk about the golf that may come in the next two days before his semi-final Friday against Taylor Fritz. \"Once we set up a match on golf, I just go for it,\" Alcaraz said of Holland. \"I saw him playing sometimes. There are some videos of him playing golf. I would say he could beat me. \"But yeah, I would love to play against him in the golf course. For me, it would be such an honour. I will try to set it up in these two days that I will have much time to do it. So let's see if he will be available, and we'll tee it up.\" [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
