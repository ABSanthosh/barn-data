Earlier on Tuesday, world number one Jannik Sinner withdrew from the Masters 1,000 event with illness.Italy's Sinner said he had picked up a virus after arriving early in the city to practise for the event.\"Today I feel better already a little bit, but the body is not ready to compete and I still feel very, very weak,\" the 23-year-old said.\"It doesn't make sense to go on court and try to compete.\"Sinner will be hopeful of recovering before the ATP Finals, which take place in Turin from 13-20 November.",
