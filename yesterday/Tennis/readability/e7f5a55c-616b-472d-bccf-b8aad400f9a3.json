  "text": "Belinda Bencic reached her first WTA Tour final since returning from maternity leave with a surprise victory over Elena Rybakina at the Abu Dhabi Open.The Swiss former Olympic champion clinched a 3-6 6-3 6-4 triumph over world number five Rybakina in two hours and six minutes.Bencic welcomed her daughter, Bella, in April 2024, and returned from a 13-month break from the tour six months later.The 27-year-old's win over Kazakhstan's Rybakina was her first against a top-five opponent since she became a mother, and she will face American Ashlyn Krueger in Sunday's final.Bencic, who won the Abu Dhabi title in 2023, said reaching the final was reward for \"working really hard to come back\" after the birth of her first child.\"It was definitely not an easy road, and I'm so excited that the results are coming so fast,\" Bencic said.\"It still doesn't mean that the work is over, so I have a long way to go, but I'm really happy how it's working on the court. I'm really enjoying myself on the court.\"Ranked 1,213 in the world four months ago, Bencic is now guaranteed a return to the top 100 following the conclusion of the tournament.World number 51 Krueger, who has one WTA singles title to her name, reached the final with a straight sets victory over Linda Noskova of the Czech Republic.The 20-year-old beat the world number 39 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 at the Zayed Sports City International Tennis Centre. Carlos Alcaraz cruised into the semi-finals of the Rotterdam Open with a routine 6-2 6-1 win over Spanish compatriot Pedro Martinez.In a first meeting between the two players, world number three Alcaraz quickly asserted his authority against Martinez - ranked 41 places below him - with consecutive breaks of serve.The 2024 Wimbledon champion sealed the first set with an ace and was handed the initiative in the second after Martinez blundered through his first two service games to surrender consecutive breaks. Alcaraz wrapped up the match with yet another break - sealing his win with a whipped cross-court forehand in just over an hour.\"With every match I play, I'm improving. Hopefully, I can end the week with the trophy,\" said Alcaraz, who will face Poland's Hubert Hurkacz in the last four.Hurkacz booked his place in the semis after fighting back from a set down to clinch a 6-7 (5-7) 6-3 6-4 win over Russian Andrey Rublev.Elsewhere, Italian qualifier Mattia Bellucci continued his dream run as he beat Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece 6-4 6-2. Bellucci, ranked 92nd in the world, will face Australia's Alex de Minaur who brushed aside German lucky loser Daniel Altmaier 6-1 6-4.",
