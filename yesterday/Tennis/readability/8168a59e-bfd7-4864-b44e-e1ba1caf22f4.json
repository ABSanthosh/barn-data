  "text": "British men's number two Cameron Norrie was knocked out of the Hong Kong Open as veteran Japanese opponent Kei Nishikori reached his first ATP semi-final in almost four years.Norrie, 29, lost 3-6 6-3 2-6 against 35-year-old Nishikori, who is just outside of the world's top 100 after suffering a catalogue of injuries over the past three seasons.Norrie, ranked 49th, is aiming to rediscover the form which took him into the top 10 in 2022.Last year, he struggled with form and fitness before finishing the season on a positive note by reaching the Moselle Open final in Metz.But he was unable to match that run in Hong Kong, where there are no seeded players remaining in the last four.Following his defeat by 2014 US Open finalist Nishikori, Norrie is set to move on to the ASB Classic in Auckland - the final tournament before the Australian Open begins on 12 January.Meanwhile, British number one Jack Draper has been practising at Melbourne Park as he ramps up his preparations for the opening Grand Slam of the season.Draper, 23, skipped the curtain-raising United Cup team event in Sydney - where Britain were eliminated at the quarter-final stage - because of a hip injury.After continuing to work on his fitness in London, Draper flew to Melbourne earlier this week.The world number 15, who is looking to build on his breakthrough 2024 season, remains confident of being in good shape when the Australian Open starts.However, the US Open semi-finalist will be playing competitively for the first time since losing at the Paris Masters on 31 October.",
