Britain's Katie Boulter, Emma Raducanu, Sonay Kartal, Jodie Burrage, Jack Draper, Cameron Norrie and Jacob Fearnley all have direct entry into the main draw at the first major of 2025.Former world number one Naomi Osaka has said she will have a scan on the injury that forced her to retire from the Auckland Classic final, but remains optimistic about playing at the Australian Open.The 27-year-old was playing in her first WTA final in three years after taking a 15-month break and giving birth to her first child midway through 2023.However, she was forced to quit with an abdominal injury after winning the first set 6-4 against Denmark's Clara Tauson on Sunday.A two-time champion at the Australian Open, Osaka said: \"I'm having an MRI today to assess.\"I don't feel that it's too serious and I still feel very optimistic about AO.\"The Australian Open main draw begins on Sunday.",
