  "description": "Tommy Paul will make his Top 10 debut in the PIF ATP Rankings this coming week at the Dallas Open. On Saturday afternoon, the defending champion learned his draw. The third seed will take on fellow American Jenson Brooksby in the pair’s third Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. “The field is definitely super strong. I knew it was going to be. Everyone wants to come play here,” Paul, the new World No. 9, said. “In terms of Americans, we absolutely love playing in the States. It’s our favourite time of the year, this swing and also the US Open series, so we’re all excited to play here. We love Dallas and we love playing in Dallas.” One year ago when Paul lifted the trophy at the Dallas Open, then an ATP 250 event, it was held at Southern Methodist University. Now an ATP 500, the tournament is being played at The Star, the world headquarters and practice facility of the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys. “The courts feel great,” Paul said. “Obviously I have great memories last year here and everything has improved a tonne, so I’m really happy to be back.” [ATP APP] Ironically, Paul wore a Philadelphia Eagles hat to the draw ceremony in front of Cowboys’ faithful. “The colours are great,” Paul said of the blue-and-gray courts, replicating the colours of the Cowboys, the Eagles’ rival. “They’re better on the court than on a football field, that’s for sure.” Three of the Top 10 players in the world are in the field. Top seed Taylor Fritz will open against Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech and second seed Casper Ruud will play Marcos Giron. One of the most interesting first-round clashes pits sixth seed Tomas Machac against former World No. 4 Kei Nishikori, who Saturday led Japan to Davis Cup victory on home soil against Great Britain. Seventh seed Alex Michelsen will face former Top 10 star Cameron Norrie. Five of the eight seeds in the draw are American. Fourth seed Ben Shelton will take on Aleksandar Vukic in a rematch of the 2022 Champaign ATP Challenger Tour final (won by Shelton) and fifth seed Frances Tiafoe plays Japanese Taro Daniel.
