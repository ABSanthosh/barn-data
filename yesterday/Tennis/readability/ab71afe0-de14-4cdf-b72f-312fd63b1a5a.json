Runner-up at last month's Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF in Jeddah, the 19-year-old qualifier dug deep for a 6-3, 7-6(4), 6-7(8), 1-6, 7-6(10-7) triumph over the fifth seed in four hours, 49 minutes, crossing the line at 2:55 a.m in Melbourne.

With his gutsy victory, the Californian became the second-youngest American man to reach the third round at the Australian Open after 18-year-old Pete Sampras in 1990.
