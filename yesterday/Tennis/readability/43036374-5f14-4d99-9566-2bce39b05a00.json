And that tournament. And most matches he has contested in the 15 months since.From the start of that tournament in Beijing, Sinner's record is 98 wins and just nine defeats - and three of those losses were against four-time Grand Slam champion and rival Carlos Alcaraz.Sinner replaced Novak Djokovic as world number one in June 2024 and since then has won a record-equalling 47 of his first 50 matches as the top ranked men's player, matching Bjorn Borg and Jimmy Connors.He also has a 30-2 record at Slams since winning his first Melbourne title 12 months ago.Cash said: \"Sinner and Alcaraz are so far ahead of everybody else.\"Until other young guys come through it is a two-horse race. We saw that for a while with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, then [came] Andy Murray, Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka.\"Things can change really quickly, but as of now it's a one-horse or two-horse race for the Grand Slams.\"Sinner 'maturing on and off the court'Before Sinner became the youngest man since 1993 to win back-to-back Australian Open men's singles titles, co-coaches Simone Vagnozzi and Darren Cahill identified Sinner's maturity as key to his progress.Australian Cahill, coach to former top-ranked players Andre Agassi and Andy Murray, said: \"He's just 23 but sometimes it feels like he's much older and wiser than we are. \"He's an incredible young man. He's matured, for sure, not just on the court but certainly off it as well. \"You grow up fast. You need a wise head on your shoulders. Jannik has one of those.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jannik Sinner is the 11th player in the Open era to retain the Australian Open men's singles titleSinner moves exceptionally well for his 6ft 3in frame, marrying court-consuming agility with robust endurance.His serve has also improved. Sinner won 91.4% of his service games in 2024, his 563 aces representing a 29% increase on the year before and more than 50% on 2022. He led the Tour for second serve points won (57.9%) and, in condemning Zverev to a third major final defeat, became just the fourth player in 35 years to not face a single break point in a major final.Perhaps what separates Sinner from most is his resilience in high-pressure moments. He saved an unmatched 73.7% of the break points he faced in 2024, while also ranking second for tie-breaks won (75%).Sinner has also credited sleep as a key factor in his success - including pre-match naps.\"Usually I'm quite relaxed until 20 minutes before the match,\" Sinner said.\"I try to sleep in as long as possible. I slept around 10 hours [before playing in the third round]. Hopefully I wake up when it counts.\"'He likes to be in a storm' - Sinner's uncertain futureSinner is the first player to claim 10 successive straight-set wins over top-10 opponents since the ATP rankings were established in 1973.But, while he has started the year in the same dominant fashion he ended the last, there is uncertainty over his future.Sinner was cleared of any wrongdoing by an independent tribunal after twice testing positive for the banned substance clostebol in March 2024.However, the World Anti-Doping Agency has appealed against that decision and will seek a ban of between one and two years at the Court of Arbitration for Sport on 16-17 April.That hearing will take place more than five weeks before Roland Garros, the second Grand Slam of the year, but it is not known whether a verdict will be delivered before then.\"I think Jannik likes this situation, the pressure point, to be in a storm, in a difficult moment. In this moment, he [plays] the best tennis,\" his coach Vagnozzi said.Former British player Annabel Croft told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"There's a lot coming up. I think you have to just admire the way he just puts it all to one side and focuses on one point, one day at a time.\"",
