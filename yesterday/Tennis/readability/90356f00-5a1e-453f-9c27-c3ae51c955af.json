  "text": "D'Arcy Maine, ESPN Senior WriterJan 18, 2025, 05:26 PM ETThe 2024 major season ended with two Americans -- Taylor Fritz and Jessica Pegula -- playing for the singles titles at the US Open. Their collective success, as well as that of other Americans throughout the year, set up high expectations for 2025.With 14 men and 19 women competing in the main draws at the Australian Open, it seemed as if chances were high for more deep runs at the year's first Slam. Now that we're officially into the second week in Melbourne, it's safe to say, the American contingent is living up to the hype. A history-making six men and five women from the United States reached the third round.While Fritz and Pegula were upset in the round of 32, and other notable names such as Frances Tiafoe and Amanda Anisimova were also sent home early, seven Americans remain -- the most in the round of 16 at the Australian Open since 2004.Three of those still contending -- Coco Gauff, Alex Michelsen and Learner Tien -- are under 21 years old. In fact, this marks the first major since 1991(!) in which two American men 20 or under have reached the second week.No American has won the title Down Under since Sofia Kenin did so in 2020, and no American man has done it since Andre Agassi claimed victory in 2003.Will this be the year fortunes change for those representing the red, white and blue? Here are the Americans remaining in the draw, how they got here and what (or who) stands between them and the quarterfinals.Coco GauffWho she has beaten so far: Sofia Kenin, Jodie Burrage, No. 30 Leylah FernandezUp next: Belinda BencicDespite being just 20 years old, Gauff has been one of the country's most consistent performers over the past two seasons. She won her first and only (for now, anyway) major title at the 2023 US Open, and after making some technical and personnel changes with her team, she recovered from a challenging 2024 season by closing it out with the trophy at the WTA Finals.The No. 3-seeded Gauff has opened the 2025 season with eight consecutive victories -- becoming just the fifth woman in the Open Era to achieve such a record -- and helped lead the U.S. team to a championship at the United Cup earlier this month. In the final, she defeated world No. 2 and five-time major champion Iga Swiatek 6-4, 6-4 for her second straight win over the Polish superstar.In Melbourne, Gauff has yet to drop a set and has charmed the crowds with her Marvel-inspired looks and funny on-court interviews. Although Gauff struggled with her forehand early in the match against Fernandez, she remained unfazed and closed out the match in just 75 minutes, advancing to the second week of a Slam for a staggering 14th time.While many fans had hoped for a showdown with Naomi Osaka in the next round, Osaka was forced to retire from her third-round match because of an abdominal injury. Gauff will instead face Bencic, the 2020 Olympic gold medalist who returned from childbirth earlier this month. The two have played twice previously, with the series split. Gauff won their last meeting in the quarterfinals in Washington, D.C., in 2023, en route to the title and at the start of her wildly successful hard-court summer season.But Gauff didn't seem too concerned about her next opponent, or even about matching her 2024 semifinal result at the tournament, and instead shared her newfound perspective Friday after the win over Fernandez.\"Tennis feels so high stakes, but it's really not,\" Gauff said. \"I'm so lucky to do what I do -- [and] also get paid doing it. \"My biggest thing I learned last year is just not to take anything for granted, and [I] just realized this time is going to go by so fast.\"Hopefully, it doesn't feel like it in the moment but I'm sure 20 years from now I'll be, 'Dang, sometimes I wish I could go back.' I'm just trying to enjoy it while I'm here.\"Tommy PaulWho he has beaten so far: Christopher O'Connell, Kei Nishikori, Roberto Carballes BaenaUp next: Alejandro Davidovich FokinaThe 27-year-old had the best major result of his career in Melbourne in 2023 when he reached the semifinals -- and he certainly looks like he's capable of repeating that feat again this time around.Paul, the tournament's No. 12 seed, had dramatically different matches throughout the first week. He needed five sets (and a medical timeout for treatment on his shoulder) to get past O'Connell, an Aussie who had the crowd behind him, in the first round, but then recorded bagel sets against both Nishikori and Carballes Baena. In his third-round 7-6 (0), 6-2, 6-0 victory over Carballes Baena, Paul had 56 winners to 29 unforced errors, and he won 37 of 46 net points.\"That's definitely the game plan coming in, for most of my matches, try to get to the net and play aggressive,\" Paul said during his on-court interview after the match. \"Today it worked out. I was happy with how I played.\"Paul defeated Davidovich Fokina in the round of 64 during his triumphant 2023 Australian Open -- and in the two other matches they have since played, both also in 2023. But that certainly doesn't mean a victory is guaranteed. Davidovich Fokina has proven he can never be counted out this week as he became the first man in 20 years to earn consecutive two-set comeback wins at the Australian Open.And regardless of what happens in the fourth round or beyond, Paul is expected to break into the top 10 for the first time in his career when the rankings are released following the Australian Open. He is currently No. 9 in the live rankings.Emma NavarroWho she has beaten so far: Peyton Stearns, Wang Xiyu, Ons JabeurUp next: No. 9 Daria KasatkinaThe No. 8 seed Navarro had a breakthrough season in 2024, reaching the semifinals at the US Open and the quarterfinals at Wimbledon, in addition to winning her first WTA title (Hobart) and making the Olympic team.While she went just 1-2 in her two lead-in tournaments ahead of the Australian Open, it seems the 23-year-old has brought her best, or at least grittiest, tennis to Melbourne. She has needed deciding sets in all three matches thus far, and she managed to hold off a resurgent Jabeur in Saturday's third-round clash, winning 6-4, 3-6, 6-4.\"I love three sets! I love tennis so much I can't resist, I got to play three sets\" Navarro joked on court after the match. \"I just wanted to stick in there and keep believing in myself and know that if I put myself in the best position to do what I want to do, then maybe I'll come out and top. I was able to do that.\"She then went on to credit her dad for her endurance in long matches and how he used to \"drag\" her and her siblings into grueling hikes and bike rides.Navarro, a former NCAA champion, is now into the fourth round at the event for the first time -- and she has reached the second week at all four majors in just her ninth Slam appearance. She is the only American woman besides Gauff to have reached the four major fourth rounds since the start of last season.She will take on Kasatkina, a 2022 French Open semifinalist, on Monday in their first career meeting. The 27-year-old Kasatkina has not lost a set so far in Melbourne and has dropped just 12 total games.Alex MichelsenWho he has beaten so far: No. 11 Stefanos Tsitsipas, James McCabe, No. 19 Karen KhachanovUp next: No. 8 Alex de MinaurThere is perhaps no one in the tournament with a more impressive run to the fourth round than 20-year-old Michelsen.Making just his second appearance at the Australian Open -- and having reached the third round during his debut in 2024 -- Michelsen is the third-youngest American man since Andy Roddick did so in 2003 to reach the second week in Melbourne, and the sixth youngest in the Open Era. He is also just the third U.S. men's player since 1990 (14 years before he was born) to defeat two ATP top-20 players before the round of 16 at a major.During his first-round stunner over Tsitsipas, a 2023 finalist at the event, Michelsen played fearless tennis and took control early. Despite the moment and the opponent, Michelsen and his confidence never wavered. He defeated his far-more-experienced opponent in four sets. On Saturday against Khachanov, a 2023 Australian Open semifinalist, he won in straight sets and successfully thwarted any of Khachanov's efforts to get back into the match.\"I played unbelievable for most of the match,\" Michelsen said on court. \"I don't know what's going on. ... I've never hit my forehand that well. I'm super happy and hope to keep this momentum going.\"Having already won over the crowd with his audacious play, he continued to enamor fans in the stands as he joked about not having time to properly chat with his mother back home in California earlier in the day.\"Mom, hi! I'm sorry I only called you for a minute this morning. I had things to do,\" he said looking into the camera. \"I love you. I miss you. I hope everything's good at home.\"Currently ranked No. 42, Michelsen is now projected to rise to a career high of No. 34 in the latest rankings after Saturday's win -- and would be just outside the top 30 with another victory. He has twice played against De Minaur, splitting their two matches but winning their lone hard-court contest in Los Cabos this past February 6-4, 6-1.Madison KeysWho she has beaten so far: Ann Li, Elena-Gabriela Ruse, No. 10 Danielle CollinsUp next: No. 6 Elena RybakinaPerhaps the most experienced American remaining, the 29-year-old Keys is a two-time semifinalist in Melbourne and also played in the 2017 US Open final. The No. 19 seed opened her 2025 season with a quarterfinal appearance in Auckland and the title last week in Adelaide. She is now riding an eight-match win streak into the fourth round, following her 6-4, 6-4 third-round victory over fellow American (and tournament villain) Collins on Saturday.The victory marked her fifth win over a top-10 opponent at the Australian Open but her first since beating Barbora Krejcikova, the then-No. 4 seed, in the quarterfinals in 2022.\"I've been playing some good tennis,\" Keys said on court Saturday night. \"I always really love playing in Australia.\"Keys now looks to reach her 11th major quarterfinal but will first have to get past Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion, on Monday. They have each won twice in their head-to-head series, with Rybakina taking their most recent meeting in Miami last year. Keys won their only previous showdown at a major, however, with a three-set victory in the third round at the 2022 French Open.Learner TienWho he has beaten so far: Camilo Ugo Carabelli, No. 5 Daniil Medvedev, Corentin Moutet (Qualifying: Gregoire Barrere, Juan Pablo Ficovich, Jozef Kovalik)Up next: Lorenzo SonegoEasily one of the best stories of the tournament, the 19-year-old Tien has gone from qualifying to the fourth round in his Australian Open debut behind solid play and a seismic upset over Medvedev, a three-time finalist, in the second round.Tien is now the youngest man to reach the second week at the event since Rafael Nadal in 2005 and the second-youngest American man in the Open Era to do so, behind only Pete Sampras.\"I don't think I can start comparing myself to [Nadal] now, but that's really cool,\" Tien, who was the runner-up at the Next Gen ATP Finals in December, said when told of what he had achieved.During his win over Medvedev, Tien needed five sets -- and nearly five hours -- in a match that ended just before 3 a.m. He had his initial match point in the third set, but Medvedev clawed his way back. It was ultimately decided, almost two hours after that first match point attempt, in a 10-point deciding-set tiebreak, and Tien showed his steely resolve for a 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-7 (8), 1-6, 7-6 (7) final score.\"It was definitely harder than maybe it could have been, but, whatever,\" Tien later told the crowd.But on Saturday, taking the court just hours after training partner Michelsen secured his ticket to the second week, Tien was far more efficient. He defeated Moutet in straight sets, 7-6 (10), 6-3, 6-3. He couldn't hide his excitement about what he had achieved after the match.\"This [has] exceeded my expectations, what I was hoping for coming into this week,\" Tien said. \"You go into every match believing you can win, but to be in the second week is amazing.\"He will next play Sonego, who is also seeking his maiden Slam quarterfinal bid, for the first time. However, no matter what happens in Monday's match, Tien will be one of the tournament's big winners. He arrived in Melbourne ranked No. 121 and should be in the top 80 in the next rankings -- a new career high. He will have almost doubled his career earnings by reaching the fourth round.Ben SheltonWho he has beaten so far: Brandon Nakashima, Pablo Carreno Busta, No. 16 Lorenzo MusettiUp next: Gael MonfilsThe 22-year-old Shelton has gone somewhat under the radar during his latest run in Melbourne as his (slightly) younger cohorts receive much of the limelight. He even joked about being \"old news\" at the start of his news conference on Saturday. However, that might not be the case for much longer, and he's not all that far removed from his own star turn at the tournament.Two years ago, and playing outside of the United States for the first time, Shelton was the surprise quarterfinalist at the Australian Open and went on to advance to the semifinals at the US Open later in the year. Since then, he has become one of the country's best-known players and has won two ATP titles. During the first week in Melbourne, he has dropped just two sets and has largely been in control during all three of his matches. During Saturday's clash with Musetti, who had beaten him in both of their previous meetings, Shelton staved off a decider by gutting out the victory in a fourth-set tiebreak for a 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (5) win.\"He's definitely one of the most talented guys on tour,\" Shelton, the No. 21 seed, said after the match. \"One of the top three shot-makers on tour. He does some things you can't believe when he's on the court. ... We say on tour if someone beats you three times in a row, they're your daddy, so I was fighting to not let that happen.\"It marked Shelton's third victory over a top-20 player at a Slam. He is now one match away from replicating his previous best result in Melbourne and from reaching the third major quarterfinal of his career. But it won't be easy against the resurgent Monfils, a 38-year-old fan favorite who came back to defeat the heavily favored Fritz on Saturday. Shelton and Monfils have never played, but it has the potential to be an electrifying classic between two of the tour's best showmen. Shelton talked about watching Monfils' career highlights on YouTube and said he had the \"greatest mixtape\" in all of tennis.Shelton is the only seeded player remaining in his quarter of the draw, but he said that was irrelevant to him.\"I always feel like I have a chance,\" he told reporters. \"I always back myself, I always play the big guys, I feel like I have stuff that can make them uncomfortable. I never walk on the court not thinking I have a chance to win. It's just the way that I'm wired and probably why I've had some success and moments that I probably shouldn't have had, or before I was really ready for it. I don't really care who's on the other side of the court.\"",

He will have almost doubled his career earnings by reaching the fourth round.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr/\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca data-player-guid=\"2358bec1-f6f0-3540-a37e-13bc322d2c08\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=9250\"\u003eBen Shelton\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho he has beaten so far:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca data-player-guid=\"b55524e2-a931-d142-f794-50b742380e8e\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=3774\"\u003eBrandon Nakashima\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca data-player-guid=\"7ba77580-4f3a-73fd-66f7-7354306769dd\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=1590\"\u003ePablo Carreno Busta\u003c/a\u003e, No. 16 \u003ca data-player-guid=\"9b79e506-da5f-e10a-6b4e-9a2a93ed34bb\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=3764\"\u003eLorenzo Musetti\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUp next:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca data-player-guid=\"2262b9be-52a3-4979-3e0c-722694ff682b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=242\"\u003eGael Monfils\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 22-year-old Shelton has gone somewhat under the radar during his latest run in Melbourne as his (slightly) younger cohorts receive much of the limelight. He even joked about being \u0026#34;old news\u0026#34; at the start of his news conference on Saturday. However, that might not be the case for much longer, and he\u0026#39;s not all that far removed from his own star turn at the tournament.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTwo years ago, and playing outside of the United States for the first time, Shelton was the surprise quarterfinalist at the Australian Open and went on to advance to the semifinals at the US Open later in the year. Since then, he has become one of the country\u0026#39;s best-known players and has won two ATP titles. During the first week in Melbourne, he has dropped just two sets and has largely been in control during all three of his matches. During Saturday\u0026#39;s clash with Musetti, who had beaten him in both of their previous meetings, Shelton staved off a decider by gutting out the victory in a fourth-set tiebreak for a 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (5) win.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026#34;He\u0026#39;s definitely one of the most talented guys on tour,\u0026#34; Shelton, the No. 21 seed, said after the match. \u0026#34;One of the top three shot-makers on tour. He does some things you can\u0026#39;t believe when he\u0026#39;s on the court. ... We say on tour if someone beats you three times in a row, they\u0026#39;re your daddy, so I was fighting to not let that happen.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt marked Shelton\u0026#39;s third victory over a top-20 player at a Slam. He is now one match away from replicating his previous best result in Melbourne and from reaching the third major quarterfinal of his career. But it won\u0026#39;t be easy against the resurgent Monfils, a 38-year-old fan favorite who came back to defeat the heavily favored Fritz on Saturday. Shelton and Monfils have never played, but it has the potential to be an electrifying classic between two of the tour\u0026#39;s best showmen. Shelton talked about watching Monfils\u0026#39; career highlights on YouTube and said he had the \u0026#34;greatest mixtape\u0026#34; in all of tennis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShelton is the only seeded player remaining in his quarter of the draw, but he said that was irrelevant to him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026#34;I always feel like I have a chance,\u0026#34; he told reporters. \u0026#34;I always back myself, I always play the big guys, I feel like I have stuff that can make them uncomfortable. I never walk on the court not thinking I have a chance to win. It\u0026#39;s just the way that I\u0026#39;m wired and probably why I\u0026#39;ve had some success and moments that I probably shouldn\u0026#39;t have had, or before I was really ready for it. I don\u0026#39;t really care who\u0026#39;s on the other side of the court.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
