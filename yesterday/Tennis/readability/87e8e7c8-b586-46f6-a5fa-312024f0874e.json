  "description": "A familiar face in a not-so-familiar setting! Novak Djokovic has spent plenty of time on the practice court with his new coach Andy Murray in the past few weeks. Yet the Serbian still needed a little time to adjust to having his great ATP Tour rival in his player box on Monday during his Australian Open win against Nishesh Basavareddy. ‚ÄúI did, of course, practice sessions with him the whole week before tonight's match. But it's different in an official match, centre court, night session,‚Äù said Djokovic after his 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 victory against #NextGenATP American Basavareddy. ‚ÄúThe court on which we have faced each other the opposite side of the net quite a few times actually. I think we played I don't know how many finals. That's why it was a little bit strange to see that and experience that. ‚ÄúI'm obviously enjoying myself spending time with him on the court and off the court, talking to him about tennis, just picking his brain, understanding how he sees tennis. I try to ask him questions a lot of times, how he sees my game. He asks me constantly to understand how I feel, what I'm going through. ‚ÄúIt's still that initial period of getting to know each other. There's a lot of communication.

The record 24-time Grand Slam champion and 10-time titlist in Melbourne was impressed with the energy emanating from his new coach, against whom he triumphed in four Australian Open championship matches. ‚ÄúHe's constantly supportive and encouraging me. He's brilliant with that,‚Äù revealed Djokovic. ‚ÄúHe cares a lot and he's putting a lot of energy into trying to make me feel good on the court. I think that's what I need, honestly.
