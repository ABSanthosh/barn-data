  "text": "Halep to stay 'patient' after another comeback lossImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Simona Halep has won one of her five matches - across the WTA and Challenger tours - since returning in March 2024 after a 19-month exileFormer world number one Simona Halep says she needs to remain patient after her latest comeback on the WTA Tour ended in a straight-set defeat.Halep, 33, was playing only her second match at the highest level since being allowed to compete again after a doping ban.The two-time Grand Slam champion returned to competitive action at the Miami Open in March after an initial four-year punishment was reduced to nine months.Losing 6-3 6-3 at the Hong Kong Tennis Open to China's Yung Yae, ranked 45th in the world, was Halep's first tour-level outing since Miami because of a knee injury.\"My level was not bad at all but the opponent played really well and had confidence,\" said Halep, who played two matches at a second-tier Challenger event at the end of September.\"I'm not happy with the way I played but it was much better than the previous match.\"Ranked 883rd in the world, Halep is relying on being given tournament wildcards as she looks to rebuild her career.Halep, who won the 2018 French Open and Wimbledon in 2019, always maintained her innocence after being charged with two separate doping offences.While her case was partially upheld, the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled Halep 'on the balance of probabilities' had not taken roxadustat - an anti-anaemia drug which stimulates the production of red blood cells in the body - intentionally.Cas also dismissed a second charge over irregularities found in her athlete biological passport.On her upcoming plans, Halep said: \"It depends on the wildcards, but I just want to work harder because I need a stronger body to perform at this level. \"I will take it slow. I have to give myself patience and try to get better day by day.\"More on this story",
