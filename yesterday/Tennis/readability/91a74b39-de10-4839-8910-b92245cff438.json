  "description": "Novak Djokovic is ready to rock the Miami Open presented by Itau for the first time in six years, and he is starting off on a high note by meeting rock legend Bon Jovi on Thursday. The two stars enjoyed an extended conversation and posed for a photo at the ATP Masters 1000 event. Making his 19th appearance in Miami, the Serbian arrives at this year’s edition seeking to regain his top form, having lost his opening match in Indian Wells and in Doha last month. But the fourth seed is determined to keep the faith and make a memory at Hard Rock Stadium. “Let’s say I am in a pursuit to find the desired level of tennis. I haven't played my best, even close to my best in Indian Wells and Doha. After I retired in my semi-finals in Australia, I haven’t been able to find that quality of tennis I’ve been looking for,” Djokovic said in a press conference. “I’ve been working hard, giving it my all on the practice court. Eventually it’s going to come, I know that. Hopefully here. I played great in Australia, I thought I had a pretty good shot at the title in Melbourne. It’s unfortunate that it ended for me the way that it ended.” The 37-year-old Djokovic is just one title shy of capturing his 100th tour-level crown. Should he win his seventh Miami trophy, Djokovic would break his tie with Andre Agassi for most titles at the hard-court event. Despite the recent skid, Djokovic is drawing on his semi-final run at the Australian Open as evidence that he can still contend for trophies. “It’s still encouraging for me to experience the way I was playing in Australia. I’m still able to win against the likes of Alcaraz,” said Djokovic, who defeated Carlos Alcaraz in a four-set quarter-final in Melbourne before retiring in his semi-final against Alexander Zverev. “That’s probably the biggest reason why I still keep pushing myself, motivating myself, because I know I still have it in my legs, my hands, my arms. “I still have that tennis level that can put me in a good position to win the biggest titles in the sport.” Boasting a 44-7 tournament record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, Djokovic is competing in Miami for just the second time since the tournament relocated from Key Biscayne to Hard Rock Stadium. The Belgrade native first won the event as an 18-year-old in 2007, and most recently in 2016. Aiming to become the oldest ATP Masters 1000 champion in series history (since 1990), Djokovic will begin against Australian Rinky Hijikata in what will be their second Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. Djokovic won their first encounter 6-3, 6-3 earlier this year in Brisbane. “I haven’t played in Miami in six years, I’ve missed it,\" Djokovic said. \"I’ve always loved the Sunshine Double. I’ve had plenty of success, I think I won two or three times in a row the Sunshine Double [2014-2016]. “I look forward to getting out in front of the very vibrant crowd. I think here, very international as well, a lot of South Americans that love tennis and just always love the atmosphere here in Miami. I thought it was very unique so I can’t wait to be out on the court.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
