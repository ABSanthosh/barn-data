  "text": "Zverev heckled again over domestic abuse allegationsImage source, ReutersImage caption, Alexander Zverev is the current world number threeAlexander Zverev asked for a spectator who heckled him over domestic abuse allegations to be kicked out of his Munich Open quarter-final.The German number one seed was serving at 5-5 in the second set against Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor when the fan shouted: \"Let's go, you wifebeater.\"Zverev spoke to chair umpire Fergus Murphy and could be heard saying \"Fergus, please kick him out\". It is not clear if the spectator was ejected from the stadium. In January, Zverev was heckled by a spectator during the Australian Open men's singles trophy ceremony. As he stepped up to receive his runners-up trophy, a spectator loudly shouted: \"Australia believes Olya and Brenda.\"The 27-year-old was accused of violence by his former girlfriend Olya Sharypova in 2020 and of domestic abuse in 2023 by Brenda Patea, with whom he has a child.Zverev has repeatedly denied both sets of allegations and a Berlin court case brought by Patea was discontinued last year. Zverev won the match on Friday against Griekspoor 6-7(6) 7-6(3) 6-4. He will face Hungary's Fabian Marozsan in the semi-final on Saturday.What's the background?In October 2020, former girlfriend Sharypova accused Zverev of violence and emotional abuse during their relationship. Zverev denied the allegations and said they were \"unfounded\".Sharypova did not press charges, and a 15-month investigation by the men's ATP Tour found there was \"insufficient evidence\" to substantiate claims made by Sharypova and so Zverev did not face disciplinary action.In November 2023, Zverev was given a penalty order and fined by a German court after being accused of physically abusing his ex-girlfriend Patea.Zverev denied the claims and lodged an objection against the order, which resulted in a public trial.The trial was discontinued in June 2024 after a settlement was agreed between the defendant and the complainant.At the time, the court told BBC Sport: \"The decision is not a verdict and it is not a decision about guilt or innocence.\"More on this story",
