Argentine Francisco Cerundolo earned his first Lexus ATP Head2Head win in three attempts against countryman Tomas Martin Etcheverry on Friday at the Movistar Chile Open, where the top seed is into the semi-finals. The 26-year-old rallied from a set down to oust the heavy-hitting Etcheverry 4-6, 6-3, 7-5. “Today was a really tough match,” said Cerundolo, who struck 31 winners, including 21 behind his forehand. “Tomy is an incredible player, incredible fighter, incredible friend. He’s one of my best friends on Tour. It’s really difficult to play against him. “I think we both played really nervous today. We played well but I think we both were a little bit tight, nervous.

The fifth seed Etcheverry defeated Cerundolo in Santiago two years ago en route to a final appearance. At last year's US Open, Etcheverry again overcame Cerundolo in five sets. Cerundolo will next face Serbian Laslo Djere, who ousted Jaime Faria 7-6(5), 4-6, 6-4 after two hours and 42 minutes.
