  "text": "Tatjana Maria completed an incredible run from qualifying to the title as she beat Amanda Anisimova to become the first women's champion at Queen's for 52 years.The 37-year-old German confounded the American world number 15 in a 6-3 6-4 victory.It capped an astonishing week for the mother-of-two, who dropped just one set across seven matches in nine days.She has beaten four top-15 players over the past five days, including reigning Australian Open champion Madison Keys.Such is Maria's longevity that she made her professional debut just a few days before the 23-year-old Anisimova was born.Maria threw her arms into the air in disbelief as a wide Anisimova forehand confirmed her victory before the two shared a warm hug at the net.She then darted over to celebrate with Charles, her husband and coach, and their two children - although youngest daughter Cecilia appeared to have slept through the match in her pushchair.After writing \"Queen of Queen's\" on the camera lens, Maria told BBC Sport: \"When we arrived here my little girl said 'wow, that's a nice trophy' and I said 'OK, let's go for it'.\"In the end I've won it - it's incredible. Everything is possible if you believe in it.\"You go your way, doesn't matter what it is, but you have to keep going. It's amazing.\"This was the first women's tour event at Queen's since 1973, with Wimbledon beginning on 30 June.Maria, who turns 38 in two months, is the oldest WTA Tour champion since Serena Williams won the Auckland title in 2020.She has said she wants to continue until she has played doubles with eldest daughter Charlotte, who often hits with her on the practice courts.A surprise Wimbledon semi-finalist in 2022, Maria has a game made for a grass court - but even she could not have thought her week would pan out like this.She arrived in west London on a nine-match losing streak. She leaves as the champion, having moved from 86th to inside the world's top 50 in the live rankings.Her slice-heavy style of play, accurate serving and ability to disguise her drop shots have infuriated opponent after opponent, particularly big hitters Anisimova, Keys and Elena Rybakina.Maria went an early break up in the first set, drawing errors out of Anisimova, before a thumping backhand winner from the American put it back on terms.However, Maria kept Anisimova on the move, visibly frustrating her, and a netted forehand gave Maria the break back, before she served out the set with ease.The numbers told the story, with Anisimova committing 10 unforced errors to Maria's three in the opener, and the momentum stayed with the German as she broke at the first chance in the second set.A mammoth fourth game saw seven deuces and Maria saving two break points for 3-1, before a brilliant scamper to a drop shot in the next allowed her to go a double break up.Anisimova, who won the WTA 1000 title in Qatar earlier this year, went for broke, pummelling her shots to rescue a break and keep in touch.But Maria, backed by the packed crowd, kept her nerve to serve out to 30 and secure her place in Queen's history.Maria is due to compete at the Nottingham Open, which begins on Monday, but said she will celebrate with her family first.\"This doesn't happen every week so we have to celebrate with something,\" she added.\"I think the kids will probably want some crepes with Nutella!\"",
