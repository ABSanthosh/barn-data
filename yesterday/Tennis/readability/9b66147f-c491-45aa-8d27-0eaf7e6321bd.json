  "description": "Nick Kyrgios is gearing up to make a comeback on home soil. Speaking on a panel at SXSW (South By Southwest) in Sydney on Thursday, the Aussie confirmed his participation at the 2025 Australian Open. “I will be playing the Australian Open this summer,” he said. “I just miss being out there playing in front of a home crowd. We’ve got such a crowd of guys at the moment like Alex de Minaur playing amazing tennis.” Struggling with knee and wrist injuries for the past 16 months, Kyrgios has been out of action for almost two seasons. Last year, he played a single tour-level match at the BOSS OPEN in Stuttgart and lost to Wu Yibing. “The injury I had was brutal … The surgeon said I probably wouldn’t be able to play again,” Kyrgios shared. “But I said whatever, just try and get me another two to three years of my career … It’s been a brutal last couple of years, but just being out there to play in front of a home crowd … I just want to be out there, lighting up the crowd and playing in front of my own country. “Whether it is good or bad, it will certainly be a lot of fun, for sure. I am looking forward to it … My only motivation to come back and play is to try and win a grand slam, and I’ll give it one more shot.” [ATP APP] Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley looks forward to having the home favorite back at Melbourne Park. “We love to have Nick coming back playing in 2025 … He’s back out there practicing,” Tiley said. “He’s fully expecting to play, and we expect to see Nick playing… We’ll ensure Nick’s out there playing in the main draw. “His preparation, we know he’s doing more than he’s done before, we know that he wants to do it, we know that he’s mentally preparing to get ready to play in January. He’s got to be physically healthy to do that.” - with assistance from Tennis Australia. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
