Arthur Fils, a three-time ATP Tour titlist, is the top seed and leads Blue Group. The 20-year-old Frenchman will be joined by Jakub Mensik, Learner Tien and Joao Fonseca. Alex Michelsen is the second seed at the year-end event and heads Red Group, which will also feature Shang Juncheng, Luca Van Assche and Nishesh Basavareddy. [ATP APP] At No. 20 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Fils comes into the tournament as the strong favourite and with a much higher ranking than Blue group rivals Mensik (48), Tien (122) and Fonseca (145). But Fils is expected to face a tough time in his group. He suffered a 6-0, 6-4 defeat to Fonseca in Rio de Janeiro earlier this year. Mensik has one of the most explosive and dangerous games of any player at the tournament , having earned four Top 10 wins in 2024 and Tien comes in with hot form, winning three Challenger Tour titles this season. Michelsen (41) and Shang (50) both sit inside the Top 50 in the PIF ATP Rankings. They have never faced off but will fancy their chances of advancing to the semi-finals, ranked more than 70 places above Van Assche and Basavareddy. Shang won his maiden ATP Tour title in Chengdu in September, while Michelsen reached finals in Newport and Winston-Salem in 2024. Van Assche, currently No. 128 in the PIF ATP Rankings, and World No. 138 Basavareddy make up Red Group. Van Assche reached the third round at the Australian Open in January, while Basavareddy has lifted two ATP Challenger Tour trophies since October. The Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF begins on Wednesday, with the final on Sunday 22nd December. The round-robin stage will be held from Wednesday to Friday, with the semi-finals on Saturday. The title match will occur at 8 p.m. local time (6 p.m. CET) on Sunday 22nd.
