  "text": "Tennis players facing allegations of doping or corruption will be able to access pro bono legal support as part of a new scheme launched by the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA).The PTPA, established by Novak Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil in 2020 to increase player power in the sport, said it would ensure access to \"world-class legal expertise regardless of a player's financial standing and personal resources\".Men's world number one Jannik Sinner and five-time women's Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek failed doping tests last year.The handling of those cases by tennis authorities led to criticism from some players over double standards - a claim the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) has strenuously denied.Sinner, 23, did not receive a ban after failing two tests in March - but that case will be heard at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in April after an appeal by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).Former world number one Swiatek served a one-month suspension, which ended in December, and missed three tournaments after the ITIA found the 23-year-old's positive test was caused by contamination.However, former British doubles player Tara Moore served a two-year absence because of a doping ban, which was later overturned, and told Reuters she spent £200,000 in legal fees.Moore, who co-founded the PTPA's pro bono Athlete Counsel \u0026 Equity (ACE) Program, returned to tennis in April 2024 after her ban was lifted. That decision is being challenged by the ITIA.Moore said: \"The fight to prove my innocence left me with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and overwhelming emotional distress. \"My hope is that the PTPA ACE Program and these incredible legal teams will ensure that no player has to face these challenges alone, especially in cases involving integrity issues. \"Every player deserves the chance to defend themselves without fear of financial or emotional ruin.\"",
