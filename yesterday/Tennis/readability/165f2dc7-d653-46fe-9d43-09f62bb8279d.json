  "description": "On Thursday, the Carlos Alcaraz Foundation officially opened its Los Pies en la Tierra (Ones Feet on the Ground) exhibition, which seeks to highlight the importance of equal opportunities for children. On an emotional evening on the patio of the Carcel Vieja building, where the exhibition can be visited free of charge from 14 December to 15 February, Los Pies en la Tierra was inaugurated at an event that was attended by Carlos Alcaraz, Beatriz Garfia, the foundation’s director, and Jose Ballesta, the mayor of Murcia. Los Pies en la Tierra is a call for all citizens to take pause for thought. Through the story of the life of Alcaraz, a boy with a normal childhood which allowed him to follow his path and chase his dreams, the exhibition underlines the fact that very close by there are many boys and girls who are much less fortunate, faced with obstacles that hinder their development and condition the rest of their lives. [ATP APP] “I was just like any other kid, growing up in El Palmar, in an average family, running around in the park with his friends, who went to the local school, without enjoying any luxuries,” said Alcaraz. “I was passionate about sport and tennis in particular, but it was a very normal childhood. Today we are here, feeling very fortunate and grateful and we would like to do our part by taking action for children.” “The goal of this exhibition is to show a reality, that of a very challenging childhood. It is a reality that to us may be invisible or distant, but in fact it is very close. This is about raising awareness of that, of the importance of this stage of human life,” said Beatriz Garfia, the foundation’s director. “And because, individually or collectively, we have a lot to say, we have the capacity to influence. Every small gesture counts and can make the difference to children’s lives.” After Alcaraz officially opened the exhibition by cutting the ribbon, which was symbolically hanging over a tennis net, guests had the opportunity to enjoy a guided tour of the exhibition, led by the tennis player himself and his family. Los Pies en la Tierra was conceived for visitors of all ages, and it provides an interactive experience through video games, activities, and questions. It includes some of Alcaraz’s most important trophies as well as a few surprise items the tennis player has donated. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
