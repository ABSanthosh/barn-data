The Italian’s emphatic ascent has been punctuated by milestones that reflect not just his talent but his unyielding determination. While his demeanour on and off the court remains composed and unassuming, Sinner’s dominance at the top of the ATP Tour tells a different story.         View this post on Instagram                       A post shared by ATP Tour (@atptour) Sinner carved out a stellar 2024 season that has cemented his place as one of the game’s defining forces. The first Italian No. 1 One of Sinner’s many landmark moments came in June 2024, when he became the first Italian to reach No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings. Sinner’s full-circle moment came in November, when he drew his season to a close by securing his first title on home soil (Nitto ATP Finals) and leading Italy to a successful defence of its Davis Cup title. By breaking new ground for Italian tennis, Sinner has inspired a generation of players from his home country. The year-end No. 1 After falling short to Novak Djokovic in the final of the 2023 Nitto ATP Finals, Sinner’s return to Turin was made sweeter as he collected his maiden ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours trophy. The Italian’s emphatic 2024 season saw him pull well clear of the chasing pack, with a Tour-leading 73 wins and eight titles, including his first two Grand Slam crowns. The one you can’t ignore Sinner’s scintillating rise to the top of the tennis world is something that simply cannot go unnoticed. With his blistering baseline play and eerie athleticism, Sinner soared to a 73-6 win-loss record in 2024 (18-5 vs Top 10) according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. The steely nature of his game was further highlighted in his historic run to the Nitto ATP Finals title, where he became the first player to triumph without dropping a set since Ivan Lendl in 1986.
