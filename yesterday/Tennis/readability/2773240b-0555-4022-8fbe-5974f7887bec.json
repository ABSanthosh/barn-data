  "description": "Rain has suspended play again on Tuesday at the 2025 BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, where no action will take place before 5:30 p.m. local time. After rain delayed the start of Day 7 action, Tallon Griekspoor and Yosuke Watanuki did step onto Stadium 2 in the first ATP Tour singles match of the day. However, play was suspended at 1:27 p.m. local time with the Dutchman Griekspoor leading 7-6(4), 4-1. They resumed again at 2:00 p.m and Griekspoor quickly wrapped up a 7-6(4), 6-1 win to reach the quarter-finals at an ATP Masters 1000 for the first time. On Stadium 1, Holger Rune overcame Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets to improve to 4-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. The rain began again shortly after the conclusion of Rune's win at 4:05 p.m., when Arthur Fils and Marcos Giron were forced off court at 1-1 in the first set. There will be no play before 5:30 p.m. local time. Later on Tuesday, Daniil Medvedev will play Tommy Paul in the other fourth-round match. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
