  "description": "Petr Nouza and Patrik Rikl could hardly have been more emphatic in winning their first ATP Tour title. The Czech duo on Saturday completed a perfect week at the Grand Prix Hassan II, where they downed top seeds Hugo Nys and Edouard Roger-Vasselin 6-3, 6-4. Nouza and Rikl did not drop a set across their four matches in Marrakech. In the championship match, the unseeded Nouza and Rikl saved all three break points they faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats. They are the first all-Czech team to win an ATP Tour title since Roman Jebavy/Jiri Vesely triumphed in 2017 in Istanbul. As a result of their title run in Morocco, Nouza and Rikl have jumped 16 spots to 17th in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Rankings. The 26-year-olds are now 10-9 as a team at Tour-level, a tally which includes a championship-match run in Stockholm last October. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
