The eighth-seeded Altmaier hit 10 aces and saved six of the eight break points he faced to emerge victorious in one hour and 47 minutes according to Infosys ATP Stats. Altmaier leveled the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 1-1. \"Honestly I like playing here. It was a tough match, especially mentally,\" Altmaier said. \"Finding my way into the match, how to compete on grass, was important.\" The German will next take on Spaniard Pedro Martinez or Frenchman Corentin Moutet. In other action, Laslo Djere eliminated Buyunchaokete 6-4, 6-4. The Serbian will play in-form sixth seed Gabriel Diallo or Jaume Munar in the second round. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
