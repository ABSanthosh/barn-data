    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/schwartzman-retirement-tribute-buenos-aires-2025",
    "description": "Diego Schwartzman has played the last professional tennis match of his life. Fighting back the tears, he lost 6-2, 6-2 to Pedro Martinez in the second round of the IEB+ Argentina Open on Thursday. Somewhere in that roller coaster of emotions was the pride of accomplishment (and of a dream come true). He will be remembered on Tour, as well as for his achievements, for being a player who set the bar for those looking to push themselves past whatever their own personal limitations may be, with his discipline, passion and a born ability to compete. This opinion of ‚ÄòEl Peque‚Äô is not based in any particular geographical location or a specific tournament where he enjoyed success, it is universal. Schwartzman, the player experts said would never reach the elite because of his height, proved his doubters wrong time and time again, ever since he first picked up a racquet at the age of seven. He always wore a smile on his face, and he always looked forward, which is what he tried to do one last time in the Guillermo Vilas Stadium. The emotion in his voice, as he fought back the tears, and the standing ovation the former No. 8 in the PIF ATP Rankings received was, largely, an ode to the constant challenge of disproving the naysayers; Schwartzman wanted it more than anyone, and he achieved more than most. Many moons ago, as his dreams and skills grew in parallel from the age of seven, probably his greatest concern, and that of his family, would have been how to cover the costs of progress in an ‚Äòexpensive‚Äô sport. When Schwartzman was 13 years old, a doctor told him he would never grow taller than 5‚Äô 7‚Äù. The news hit him like a train and he was unsure if he wanted to continue playing tennis. However, ‚ÄòEl Peque‚Äô, the nickname he was affectionately given many years later, never took his eye off the ball and he certainly reaped his rewards for it. With four ATP Tour titles (Istanbul 2016, Rio 2018, Los Cabos 2019 and Buenos Aires 2021) as well as 10 finals, the French Open semi-finals in 2020 and qualification for the 2020 Nitto ATP Finals in London, the Buenos Aires native produced many a masterpiece on the ATP Tour. The Argentine capital, of course, was always a special place for Schwartzman, a place where he would slip into the stands to watch his heroes play, and where he would win his first ATP Tour match in 2013. He was crowned champion of the tournament in 2021 and reached the final there in 2019 and 2022, as well as being fifth of the list of Argentine tennis players with the most main-draw matches in the history of the event, with 28; only behind M√≥naco (34), Acasuso (34), Chela (31) and Nalbandian (29). For the 32-year-old right-hander, the result against Martinez will always be just the final line in a novel with countless chapters, because his time had come to retire, as he recognised in the build-up to the event and back in May when he announced his decision. How did he prepare for that moment? By enjoying every day in his new life as a ‚Äúnon-tennis player‚Äù, by soaking up the small moments. Schwartzman went on holiday for the first time since he was 16. The fact is that for over a decade and a half, January and February were intense months for Schwartzman, with the start of the season in Australia and then the Latin American clay swing and the chance of playing at home, something that didn‚Äôt happen the rest of the year. His goodbye, then, comes at a perfect time to end the cycle. However, if there is one thing that makes Schwartzman proud of his career it is the fact that he made the decision to hang up his racquet on his own. ‚ÄúI understood my body, I understood my head. I knew I had been exhausted for a while and that I couldn‚Äôt keep up what I had always managed to do... I achieved much more than I ever dreamed of,‚Äù he told ATPTour.com. Of course, on court he was known for his enduring consistency; staying at the top of the Tour, being a member of the ‚Äòelite‚Äô for more than a decade. He leaves two particularly telling stats in his wake; Schwartzman played 36 consecutive Grand Slams starting at the 2014 French Open, and was in 52 consecutive main draws at Masters 1000 events, for over seven years. Schwartzman was present at all four majors every year for almost a decade, and with outstanding results; apart from his semi-final at the 2020 French Open (his best finish), he also reached the quarter-finals at Roland Garros (2018 and 2021) and the Australian Open (2017 and 2019). At the ATP Masters 1000s, from March 2017, when he played in the first round in Indian Wells, every time the Argentine signed up for an event in that category, he went straight into the main draw. He also went five years without dropping outside the Top 30 players in the PIF ATP Rankings. What does the future hold for him? ‚ÄúI want to help Latin American tennis by organising tournaments or being part of the present and the future of Argentinian tennis in some way,‚Äù he said in recent days. Schwartzman is an empathetic player, one of those who always looks around themselves with humility, genuinely interested in and concerned for the people around him. Going forward, ‚ÄòEl Peque‚Äô is not ready to put his feet up just yet. He wants to enjoy the rest of his life, and for the girls and boys that aspire to a life in tennis to have opportunities and to be able to make their dreams come true, just like he did. With a racquet in his hand, and his racquet bag over his shoulder, Schwartzman showed everyone what can be done.

    "description": "Diego Schwartzman is retiring from professional tennis after competing this week at the Argentina Open in his hometown of Buenos Aires. The Argentine has crafted a distinguished career, in which he became one of only 12 players from his country to crack the Top 10 of the PIF ATP Rankings, competed in the Nitto ATP Finals and went toe to toe with some of the best players in tennis history. Before saying his farewell on the court, Schwartzman wrote his goodbye to the fans, detailing in a first-person essay why he decided to retire, the lessons he has learned and plenty more. Last month, I was in Uruguay enjoying a holiday with my family when I ran into a French guy who was probably 22 or 23 years old. He said to me, ‚ÄòI remember that time you were playing Rafa at Roland Garros and the rain came!‚Äô In the 2018 quarter-finals, I led Rafa by a set and a break when the weather made us come back the next day. Rafa won the match and the tournament. I lost seven times in the second week of Grand Slam tournaments to Rafa or Nole. I was playing so well. If I didn't have these guys in front of me, I think I could have gone even deeper in these tournaments. But I am proud that I never went down against these legends without a fight, and it is nice that fans still remember that. I have not competed in a tournament since last year‚Äôs US Open and I have been able to do things like snowboard with family and even play padel a little bit. Every so often I run into fans who tell me nice things, give me hugs and everything. That has been special. This week I am retiring after the Argentina Open in Buenos Aires. While it has been a little bit sad watching tennis lately knowing this moment was coming, it was in a good way. I have a lot of amazing memories to think about and achievements to celebrate. I had the opportunity to check off many dreams and do more than people thought was possible for me. I have a small body, but it gave the biggest players in our history bad moments. ¬† # # # The beginning of the end of my career came in Hamburg in 2022. I lost in the first round in a close match, but something was not right. My body did not answer the questions that day. I was feeling emotions during the match, but not good ones. My hands were shaking a little bit. I was struggling with irritation and cramping. I thought that maybe I was a little bit tired and that I had to rest. Just two minutes after I walked off the court, I sat with my coach, Juan Ignacio Chela. He asked me different questions about my body and what I felt on court and about the match. It was a different feeling. But sometimes that happens to tennis players. For a few weeks your tennis, the mind and everything else do not work. You go home, rest, recover and that helps. But this time, I felt different. I was never the same. At the end of 2022, I thought things were improving. I had a good preseason and was feeling well entering the new year. But by the clay-court season, I knew the end would come sooner than later. After going to Australia and competing in South America, I had only won one match. The same feeling I had in Hamburg was back. I was cramping, and my body was not cooperating. I could not respond. I was really struggling and was not enjoying the process. To compete at the highest level you need to practise and do everything to a certain standard, so it was very difficult. I changed my trainer and my coaches, thinking maybe it was time to change something, listen to different voices and new ways of working. That was not the right decision. It was me. It was nobody else. What I had done for years helped me achieve a lot in our sport. At the 2017 US Open, I was a seeded player at a Grand Slam tournament for the first time and made the quarter-finals. Looking back, I had a huge opportunity to make the semi-finals against Pablo Carreno Busta. That was when I took my career to a new level. After that moment, I understood how my body was going to feel after five sets, what it was going to be like in the second week of a major. The next year I broke into the Top 20 for the first time. In 2020, I made the semi-finals at Roland Garros, reached a career-high No. 8 in the PIF ATP Rankings and competed in the Nitto ATP Finals. The following March I won my fourth and final ATP Tour title at home in Buenos Aires. It was a magical moment for a boy from Argentina. During that time I learned that to be successful takes a lot. There are so many important things: training, nutrition, mentality, having the right people around you and being confident in your abilities and preparation. I gave it my all. ¬† My tennis was not just about forehands and backhands. Sometimes I walked on court trying to think about how I could crack my opponent. It is kind of funny that in the end, tennis cracked me, and that is why this is the end. But that is okay. I am happy. If you would have told a young Diego I would accomplish what I have, my answer would have been simple: ‚ÄòNo chance‚Äô. Growing up, it was not easy for my family financially. I would travel with my mother and the hotel would never have a TV and at almost every tournament we shared a bed. Once we stayed somewhere because a room cost two pesos for the night. We scrambled to earn money to help me travel. We even sold rubber bracelets left over from my family‚Äôs old business to pay for these trips. I would run around tournaments selling them. Other kids would too, and we would give them some of the profit. So how did I make it as far as I did? I have no idea, really. I know that I was a really good player, and I can see now when I practise, I'm still good. I had four or five years at the top level, but if I‚Äôm being honest, I really did not know I was going to get there.¬† Something a lot of people spoke about was my height, 170 centimetres. I didn't like that during my career, because many times when I was playing good tournaments, everyone was asking me how I did it and how I was going to win the next match. It was all about my weight, my height and everything about my small body. Nobody is at the top without height, it's true. Barely anybody in the Top 100 is my height. I can‚Äôt lie, it was tough. I had to work so hard off the court so that my opponents did not feel I had less power or my movements were shorter or anything. For sure I know that height is a very important thing playing tennis. But more than 50 per cent the way you win matches comes from what you do away from the court. I really like when people say to me, ‚ÄòYou were a fighter, but you were also a very good tennis player‚Äô. Just being a fighter, you are not going to be at the top of the sport. You need to play good tennis. You need to have a good forehand, a good serve and good movement. Just being a fighter does not get you to the top. I was there because I was good at this sport. Nobody gave me a gift. I earned this. When I was young, I didn't expect to achieve what I did. But during my career, I belonged. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
