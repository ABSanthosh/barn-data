    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/de-minaur-hurkacz-fritz-indian-wells-2025-monday",
    "description": "Alex de Minaur recorded his 50th ATP Masters 1000 win on Monday at the BNP Paribas Open, where he earned a statement 6-4, 6-0 victory against Hubert Hurkacz to reach the fourth round in Indian Wells. The ninth-seeded Australian was in ruthless mood against Hurkacz in a blistering 75-minute win. He converted all four of his break points and saved the one break point he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to advance with little trouble. De Minaur now leads Hurkacz 2-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, with this their first meeting since 2019. De Minaur, whose best Masters 1000 result was a final run in Toronto in 2023, has never advanced beyond the fourth round in the California desert. The No. 10 in the PIF ATP Rankings will aim to change that record when he takes on Francisco Cerundolo. The Argentine beat Novak Djokovic's conqueror Botic van de Zandschulp 6-3, 6-4. De Minaur has enjoyed a good start to the season, highlighted by a first Australian Open quarter-final and a title match showing at the ATP 500 event in Rotterdam. He is 15-1 against players outside the Top 20 in 2025. Former champion Taylor Fritz recovered from a slow start to overcome Alejandro Tabilo 4-6, 6-3, 6-1. The third seed, who captured the biggest title of his career in Indian Wells in 2022, committed 43 unforced errors to 32 winners against Tabilo in a topsy-turvy performance. But he did hit with more consistency and found greater rhythm on his serve in the third set to advance after one hour and 54 minutes and improve his record on Stadium 2 to 7-0. \"I just tried to cut down on the mistakes,\" Fritz said in his on-court interview. \"I was making more random, no reason mistakes than I possibly could have thought. Even with me giving him a lot of free points, I still felt it was pretty close for the first set and a half. I just had to clean it up and be more solid. I just needed to be more solid.\" Fritz has struggled to find his best level in recent weeks, falling in his second match in Dallas and Delray Beach. The World No. 4 will aim to continue to improve on home soil in Indian Wells, where he next takes on British lefty Jack Draper. Fritz holds a 4-0 Lexus ATP Head2Head advantage against Tabilo, who snapped a seven-match losing streak when he defeated Dusan Lajovic in his opener on Saturday. There was also success for another American, Brandon Nakashima, on Day 6 in Indian Wells. The World No. 33 eliminated Italian Matteo Arnaldi 6-2, 6-4 in 75 minutes to reach the fourth round at the hard-court event for the first time. Nakashima is in good form, having advanced to the semi-finals in Acapulco earlier this month. Next up for the 23-year-old in California is Ben Shelton or Karen Khachanov. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten made a confident start to their bid for a maiden ATP Masters 1000 crown Monday at the BNP Paribas Open. The second seeds defeated Marcelo Melo and Alexander Zverev 6-2, 6-3 in Indian Wells. The reigning Wimbledon and Australian Open champions Heliovaara and Patten, who are the current leaders in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings, will play Yuki Bhambri and Andre Goransson next. Bhambri and Goransson moved into the second round with a nail-biting 3-6, 7-6(5), 10-8 win over Sander Gille and Jan Zielinski. Bhambri claimed his maiden ATP 500 title in Dubai earlier this month with Alexei Popyrin, and the Indian will hope to continue that form in the California desert, where he is making his team debut with Sweden’s Goransson. Former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Doubles Rankings Jamie Murray ensured that his 1,000th tour-level doubles match ended in victory. The Briton, teaming with Adam Pavlasek, saved a match point to rally past Ariel Behar and Robert Galloway 2-6, 7-6(5), 12-10. With his Indian Wells first-round win, Murray joined Marcelo Melo (1,079) as the only active players to contest 1,000 doubles matches. Matteo Berrettini and Lorenzo Sonego served an upset in the California desert by moving past fifth seeds Nikola Mektic and Michael Venus 6-4, 6-3. The Italians delivered a clinical first-round showing, in which they dropped just four points behind their 34 first serves, according to Infosys ATP Stats. After seeing off the fifth-seeded team, which triumphed in Auckland in January, Berrettini and Sonego will face the American duo of Ryan Seggerman and Patrik Trhac. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
