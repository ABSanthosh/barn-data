    "description": "Stan Wawrinka produced a vintage performance Thursday at the BNP Paribas Nordic Open to become the oldest quarter-finalist in Stockholm tournament history. The 39-year-old dug deep to prevail 6-4, 3-6, 7-5 against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina and record back-to-back tour-level wins for the first time since reaching the third round of the 2023 US Open. Wawrinka twice trailed by a break in the deciding set, but found some gutsy tennis to advance in two hours, 12 minutes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm super happy to get through this match, it was a tough opponent today, but the level was good and it was great to win two matches here,‚Äù said Wawrinka. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an amazing atmosphere, a full house. Thank you everybody for making so much noise.‚Äù STAN THE MAN üëè A great week continues for @stanwawrinka as he rallies past Davidovich Fokina 6-4 3-6 7-5 to reach his 112th tour-level quarter-final!@EuroTennisOpen | #EuropeanOpen pic.twitter.com/qy9mFjAXt0 ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) October 17, 2024 Wawrinka, the former No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings, capitalised on a lacklustre seventh game from the Spaniard before closing out the first set with ease. Davidovich Fokina then raised his level in a near-flawless second set, during which he won 89 per cent (16/18) of points behind his first serve, according to Infosys ATP Stats. However, the 25-year-old was unable to close out the match in a deciding set full of momentum shifts. Wawrinka eventually took advantage of an untimely double fault from his opponent to set up the sole match point needed. [ATP APP] Wawrinka will face top seed Andrey Rublev, who got underway with an emphatic 6-4, 6-1 win over Alexandre Muller. Rublev did not blink throughout the contest, during which he struck 17 winners and saved all three of the break points he faced. Rublev is currently eighth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, leading ninth-placed Alex de Minaur by just 275 points in what is turning out to be an absorbing battle for qualification for the Nitto ATP Finals. Earlier, Miomir Kecmanovic held his nerve in a thrilling contest with Nicolas Jarry that went down to the wire. The Serbian clinched the hard-fought contest 6-4, 4-6, 7-6(2). Third seed Grigor Dimitrov closed the day with a 7-6(1), 6-3 victory against Quentin Halys to record his 18th match win ‚Äî most among active players ‚Äî at the ATP 250. The Bulgarian, who won his first tour-level title in Stockholm in 2013, will meet Swiss Dominic Stricker in the quarter-finals. Dimitrov, currently tenth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, is aiming to make a late-season push and qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals for the first time since he won the season finale in 2017.

    "description": "Stefanos Tsitsipas was forced to resort to defence mode Thursday in order to secure a thrilling opening-round win at the European Open. The second seed was on the brink of defeat, but showcased his resilience to defeat Brazilian qualifier Thiago Seyboth Wild 7-6(5), 4-6, 7-5. Tsitsipas fended off three break points in the 11th game of the decider before finding a crucial break of his own to seal victory in two hours, 26 minutes. [ATP APP] ‚ÄúIt was exhausting out here having to stay in the match,‚Äù said Tsitsipas, who improved to 40-19 on the season. ‚ÄúThe comeback was crazy. When he was up in the score, I managed to stay in the points and defend well. ‚ÄúIt was all psychological at the end, I managed my nerves pretty well. I don‚Äôt usually like to build my game around defensive shots, but I had to fight, I had to do anything within my artillery to make it work.‚Äù¬† Tsitsipas set up a quarter-final clash with fifth seed Jiri Lehecka, who earlier eased past Daniel Altmaier 6-4, 6-3 in one hour, 13 minutes. The Czech was imperious on serve throughout the contest, during which he won 91 per cent (30/33) of points behind his first delivery, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Zizou Bergs brought the day to a close with a rousing win over fourth seed Sebastian Baez to the delight of the home crowd. With his 6-3, 6-4 triumph, the 25-year-old became just the third Belgian to reach the quarter-finals in Antwerp after David Goffin and Ruben Bemelmans. Bergs will next face Marcos Giron, who earlier produced a gutsy showing to edge past Arthur Rinderknech 7-6(6), 7-6(4) and reach his personal-best sixth quarter-final of the season. The eighth seed was forced to dig deep but found some steely tennis when necessary to advance in Antwerp. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
