    "description": "Friends became foes ‚Äî for 71 minutes at least ‚Äî on Monday evening when Alex Michelsen took on Learner Tien in the first round of the Fayez Sarofim \u0026 Co. U.S. Men‚Äôs Clay Court Championship. Only one of the Americans was able to move on to the second round in Houston. Michelsen did so emphatically at the ATP 250 event, dismissing his close friend Tien 6-4, 6-2 to avenge a defeat from the semi-finals of last year‚Äôs Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. ‚ÄúI needed to do pretty much everything well. He knows me like the back of his hand. I know him like the back of my hand,‚Äù Michelsen said in his on-court interview. ‚ÄúI had to serve really well and I feel like I've had some really good clay-court prep heading into this tournament, so I feel like that helped me a lot today. It was one of those days where I was playing really well, so super happy with that.‚Äù Moving on üí™ Alex Michelsen cruises through to a 6-4 6-2 victory over Tien.@mensclaycourt | #USClay pic.twitter.com/wJTOaKv2fR ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) April 1, 2025 One year ago, Michelsen played his first tour-level match on clay at this event. This time it was Tien doing the same, and the difference in experience on the surface showed. Michelsen had an answer to every problem his opponent posed on court. ‚ÄúI remember like it was yesterday, losing my first match here last year. So I know what he's feeling,‚Äù said Michelsen, who won 87 per cent of his first-serve points according to Infosys ATP Stats. ‚ÄúIt's really tough to come out here and play on clay, especially being from California. There are zero clay courts anywhere. So it was tough for him, but yeah, I played really well.‚Äù The fifth seed leveled their Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 1-1 and will next face Yannick Hanfmann or Nicolas Moreno De Alboran. Another American who moved on was qualifier Jenson Brooksby, who defeated Japan‚Äôs Taro Daniel, the No. 124 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, 6-4, 6-4. Brooksby did not face a break point en route to a showdown with third seed Alejandro Tabilo of Chile. Cristian Garin, another Chilean, defeated Switzerland‚Äôs Alexander Ritschard 6-3, 6-4. The 2019 Houston champion will play top seed Tommy Paul in the second round. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Richard Gasquet might be 38, but he continues to prove his ability to compete at the highest level. The former No. 7 in the PIF ATP Rankings rallied from the brink of defeat on Monday in Bucharest, overcoming a 4-6, 1-4 deficit to surge past Botic van de Zandschulp 4-6, 7-5, 6-1 in the first round of the Tiriac Open presented by UniCredit Bank. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Sometimes tennis you have to fight and you never know what can happen in the end of the match. I just tried to fight, to put the ball in, to play with more consistency and a little bit [deeper]. I did it,‚Äù Gasquet said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always tough to finish a match, to end a match, and it happened to him. Then I felt much better on the court and that‚Äôs tennis. ‚ÄúSometimes you win and it‚Äôs tough, but I did a great job and I‚Äôm happy to be here in Bucharest.‚Äù Not done yet üí™@richardgasquet1 completes the turnaround vs van de Zandschulp to book his spot into Round 2 üôå#TiriacOpen pic.twitter.com/DT0ob6CWmO ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) March 31, 2025 Van de Zandschulp served for the match at 5-4 in the second set but was unable to complete the victory. Gasquet converted six of his 15 break points according to Infosys ATP Stats. This is the Frenchman‚Äôs third appearance in Bucharest and first since 2008. Gasquet, who is retiring at Roland Garros, had not earned a tour-level win on clay since the Parisian major one year ago. He will next face third seed Flavio Cobolli. Last year‚Äôs finalist Mariano Navone made a winning start on his return to Bucharest, where he overcame Serbian Laslo Djere 6-1, 4-6, 6-2 to reach the second round. The seventh-seeded Argentine, who reached his second tour-level final at the clay-court event last year, committed just seven unforced errors and won 55 per cent (17/31) of points on Djere‚Äôs second serve to advance after one hour and 58 minutes in the pair‚Äôs first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. \"I am very happy to be in the second round,\" Navone said. \"I prepared well and played well in the first [set]. I had a little mistake at 4-5 in the second [set], but this is tennis. It is important for the start of European clay swing. I played very well in South America but didn't have the results I wanted. It is tough when you play good but don't close matches.\" Navone now holds a 4-0 record in opening matches on clay this season and will next play 2024 champion Marton Fucsovics in a final rematch or Italian Luca Nardi. Wild card Filip Cristian Jianu became the first Romanian to win an ATP Tour match since Marius Copil reached the quarter-finals in Antwerp in 2019. The home favourite defeated #NextGenATP American Nishesh Basavareddy 6-3, 6-4 on his ATP Tour debut in one hour and 33 minutes. The 23-year-old Jianu, up 12 spots to No. 229 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, next meets Mongasque qualifier Valentin Vacherot or Damir Dzumhur. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
