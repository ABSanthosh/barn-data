    "description": "Luciano Darderi had little time for sentiment on Tuesday at the Erste Bank Open in Vienna. The Italian dialled in for a 7-6(6), 6-2 triumph against Dominic Thiem in the final match of the former World No. 3‚Äôs career. Darderi kept his cool in a raucous atmosphere at the Wiener Stadthalle, where he edged Thiem in a tight opening set before accelerating to a 91-minute victory. It's not goodbye. It's see you later üíô#DankeDomi | @ErsteBankOpen pic.twitter.com/keOAKBtOgJ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) October 22, 2024 The 17-time tour-level champion Thiem produced some trademark moments of brilliance in his final outing as a pro, including a couple of rasping backhand winners that had the home fans on their feet. Yet Darderi, the No. 42 in the PIF ATP Rankings, did not let the occasion get the better of him and was ultimately a deserved winner on his Vienna debut. After Darderi hammered a forehand to secure his win, he was congratulated at the net by Thiem. The Austrian was then in turn saluted by his home crowd, and he also gave a short on-court speech to thank them for their support. \"I've had so many nice goodbyes in the last few months, but today I want to say thank you for all the sensational years,\" said Thiem. \"I am only a part of this career. The whole journey has been an absolute dream and I want this afternoon, this evening to be yours. I couldn't have imagined it any better. Thank you!\" Thiem had opened a 4-2 lead early in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash with Darderi, but the 22-year-old Italian responded superbly and finished the match having converted three of five break points he earned, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Darderi arrived in Vienna on a seven-match losing streak, but he will now head into his second-round meeting with seventh seed Jack Draper, a 7-6(5), 7-5 winner against Kei Nishikori, full of confidence. The Cordoba champion Darderi, who had earned only one tour-level win prior to 2024, is 24-23 for the season. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
