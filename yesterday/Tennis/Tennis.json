Let‚Äôs take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Argentine Sebastian Baez began his Movistar Chile Open title defence Thursday by ousting countryman Francisco Comesana, with whom he shares a coach, Sebastian Gutierrez. Fresh off successfully defending his Rio de Janeiro title, Baez is aiming to match that feat in Santiago, where he survived Comesana 6-3, 5-7, 7-6(5) to reach the quarter-finals.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always very hard to play with Fran. He‚Äôs a great guy, we share our team, so we are together so much,‚Äù Baez said during his on-court interview. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always difficult, but I‚Äôm happy to be in the next round.‚ÄùRed-hot Sebastian üå∂Ô∏èThe defending champ @sebaabaez7 extends his winning streak, taking down compatriot Comesa√±a in a great encounter! üá¶üá∑@chile_open | #MovistarChileOpen pic.twitter.com/bbVbQrUTlk‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) February 27, 2025 Baez trailed 3/5 in the deciding-set tie-break before tallying four consecutive points and sealing the victory with a rainbow lob winner. Leading 2/1 in the tie-break, the 24-year-old Baez retrieved a drop shot from Comesana and tumbled, looking up in disbelief after realising that he struck a winner. A seven-time tour-level champion, Baez is on a six-match winning streak. He has captured a Tour-leading 74 clay-court wins since the start of the 2022 season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Up next for the No. 31 player in the PIF ATP Rankings will be Damir Dzumhur, who overcame sixth seed Mariano Navone 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 after two hours, 36 minutes. The 32-year-old saved seven of the 10 points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats. It will be Baez and Dzumhur's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
