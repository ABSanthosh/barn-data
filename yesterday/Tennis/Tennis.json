    "description": "When Bjorn Fratangelo was injured in 2023, he began working with his then fiancée Madison Keys. What has happened ever since has been straight from a movie script. Fratangelo and Keys tied the knot this past November. Roughly six weeks later, Keys won the WTA tournament in Adelaide, her second tournament of the 2025 season. Now the American, No. 14 in the WTA Rankings, will compete in the Australian Open title match. It marks Keys’ second major final appearance and first since the US Open in 2017 — the same year Keys and Fratangelo began dating. [ATP APP] How did their relationship turn into a full-fledged on-court partnership as well? “I think it kind of started when we kind of had a little more tennis dialogue in our relationship, sort of when I was finishing my own career,” Fratangelo said in a press conference Friday in Melbourne. Fratangelo reached a career-high No. 99 in the PIF ATP Rankings in 2016 and won four ATP Challenger Tour titles. He played his final match in August 2023. “She was just bouncing ideas off of me and stuff. It was the first time I was giving input back. “Then it just came to a point where we started and decided that I was going to be with her full time. It was just like, ‘How much do you want to get out of this? Are you happy with staying 11 through 25 [in the rankings]? Do you want to try to push for more? What do you want?’” The 29-year-old Keys has enjoyed a recent resurgence, playing some of the best tennis of her life in Melbourne. She has ousted three Top 15 players, including five-time major champion Iga Swiatek in a thrilling semi-final, during which Keys saved one match point.

I think that's what I've tried to bring to the table,” Fratangelo said. “She's obviously done it her way for so long. It's brought her great success and an amazing career. I just thought, ‘Okay, if we make a few changes and some subtle tweaks here and there, maybe being 15 in the world turns to 10 and 10 can turn to eight, then all of a sudden you're in the mix, and you're being talked about again, like she is now.’” To win the title, Keys will need to defeat Aryna Sabalenka, who has lifted the Melbourne trophy the past two years. Sabalenka is No. 1 in the WTA Rankings. Fratangelo recognises Sabalenka’s elite level, drawing comparisons to some of the sport’s greatest players. “I was watching [her quarter-final] at night in the room in the hotel and there just wasn't a doubt in my mind that she wasn't going to win that match,” Fratangelo said of Sabalenka, who needed a decider in her quarter-final match. “That's kind of how you feel with Novak when he plays most matches, Serena when she played most matches, Roger, Rafa. I think she has that now.” When Keys is met with the pressure of competing in the high-stakes match Saturday, she can simply turn to her player’s box and be reminded of her biggest supporter: her husband. “I try to stay as calm as I can in the box, but I'm not going to sit here and lie to you and tell you that I don't have a pulse, you know. It’s nerve-racking,” Fratangelo said. “When you can't do anything and you're just sitting on the side, you feel kind of helpless. Like obviously if I'm playing in that situation, you're kind of dictating what happens. But when I'm just sitting there watching, it's another level of stress.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/cahill-vagnozzi-australian-open-2025-sf-reaction",
    "description": "It can be easy to forget that Jannik Sinner is just 23 years old. Still early in his career, the Italian has compiled a lengthy list of achievements. He’s held No. 1 honours in the PIF ATP Rankings since last June, won eight of his 18 tour-level trophies in the past 12 months and lost just one of his past 37 matches. A relentless competitor boasting ice-cold composure, Sinner’s next task is to defend his Australian Open title Sunday, when he battles Alexander Zverev in the final. Beyond Sinner’s accolades, one key component has earned the praise of his coaches Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi: the Italian’s maturity. “I know he's just 23 years of age, but sometimes it feels like he's much older and wiser than what we are,” Cahill said during a press conference Friday in Melbourne. “He's an incredible young man. It's no surprise to us to see him back in the final. I think that his level has been great for a long time now, but his level here in Australia is even better.”Post-match under the city lights 🌃#AO2025 | @janniksin pic.twitter.com/vBAMPiiwof— ATP Tour (@atptour) January 24, 2025 Balancing the demands of a top-tier tennis career with the joys of youth is not an easy task. Sinner’s team has seen firsthand his growth, while also reminding their charge to embrace life’s lighter moments. “He's matured, for sure,” said Cahill. “I think there are many areas of not just what he's doing on the court but certainly off the court, as well. “All these young kids, they are living a life that is great, but you have to have a wise head on your shoulders dealing with the media and the fans and the pressure of playing in front of 15,000 people and living up to expectations. You grow up fast. Jannik is one of those. “So I think there's many areas where we talk to him about making sure that he still remains a 23-year-old. He's still a young man that needs to enjoy life, enjoy the people around him, have his friends, go out and have a good time.” Perhaps those off-court moments have created a necessary balance, allowing Sinner to excel under the bright lights. “I think Jannik likes this situation, the pressure point, to be in a storm, in a difficult moment,” said Vagnozzi when reflecting on Sinner’s 7-6(2), 6-2, 6-2 semi-final victory against American Ben Shelton. “So in this moment, he [plays] the best tennis.” Sinner will put his 20-match winning streak on the line against Zverev, who the Italian trails 2-4 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Sinner is aiming for his third major crown while the 27-year-old Zverev seeks his first. “Alexander has been around, doing this for years. He's going to be a really tough opponent for Jannik. We can't wait to see how it goes,” Cahill said. “I think it's going to be a great match. Different challenges come from different opponents. Getting Zverev's serve back is going to be a challenge in itself. “It's the number one and two in the world, so it's the perfect final as far as the rankings are concerned. A great challenge for both players.”[NEWSLETTER FORM]",
