    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/best-of-2024-grand-slam-matches",
    "description": "To mark the end of another thrilling season, ATPTour.com is unveiling our annual 'Best Of' series, which will reflect on the most intriguing rivalries, matches, comebacks, upsets and more. Today, we are looking at the best Grand Slam matches of the year. The game's biggest stars shined bright on the Grand Slam stage this season, with the best-of-five-set format serving up a slew of memorable matches in 2024. Each of the dramatic encounters listed below went the distance, with twists and turns throughout each of the five frames. There were plenty of matches to choose from, with standout encounters like Daniil Medvedev's Australian Open semi-final against Alexander Zverev (read more) just missing out. Wins for Novak Djokovic, Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz and Frances Tiafoe feature in our selection of top major matches, with Sinner, Alcaraz and Tiafoe all appearing twice. [ATP APP] 5) US Open R3, Frances Tiafoe d. Ben Shelton, 4-6, 7-5, 6-7(5), 6-4, 6-3 Almost one year to the day after their electric 2023 US Open quarter-final encounter, Americans Tiafoe and Shelton produced another classic at their home major. In an Arthur Ashe Stadium battle of top servers, it was Tiafoe's returning and net play that made the difference in this match of razor-thin margins. After three sets, the scoreboard looked similar to 2023: Shelton won the first and third sets, taking the latter in a tense tie-break. But the sets were closer in the sequel, and Tiafoe felt the tennis was better, too. Avenging his previous New York defeat and a three-set loss in April's Houston final, Tiafoe carved out 21 break points against the electric Shelton serve, with that number nearly matching the lefty's ace count. Tiafoe converted five — one in each set — on his way to his second US Open semi-final appearance. \"Since I've been on Tour, today was probably the best that anyone has returned my serve that I have seen,\" Shelton said. \"From early in the match, there was one where I went big out wide, like 130 [mph], and he cracked it down the line clean, hit the baseline, and I was, like, 'Oh, one of those days.'\" \"I think the level was a lot higher this year than we played last year, throughout the five sets,” he said. It was not just about the tennis, either. The clash felt like a spectacle, with the fans inside the world's biggest tennis-only stadium thrilled throughout. Even in defeat, Shelton could not help but smile as he approached the net to greet Tiafoe. Photo credit: Al Bello/Getty Images 4) Wimbledon R3, Carlos Alcaraz d. Frances Tiafoe, 5-7, 6-2, 4-6, 7-6(2), 6-2 Two of the game's greatest entertainers combined for one of the must-see matches of the 2024 season. Competing for the first time since their five-set epic in the 2022 US Open semi-finals, Alcaraz and Tiafoe once again went the distance in a show-stopping affair on Wimbledon's Centre Court. Like in New York, Alcaraz emerged victorious and went on to lift the title.  Tiafoe had been slumping entering Wimbledon, but with nothing to lose against the Spanish defending champion, he hit fearlessly off both baseline wings to build a two-sets-to-one lead. At 4-4 in the fourth set, Tiafoe threatened at 0/30 but could not make the crucial breakthrough. Instead, Alcaraz took back control of the match by racing to a 5/0 lead in the ensuing tie-break.  The American opened the deciding set with a confident hold, but Alcaraz cruised through five straight games to stop Tiafoe's upset bid. \"It is always a big challenge playing against Frances,\" Alcaraz said. \"He is a really talented player and tough to face. We saw it once again that he deserves to be at the top and deserves to fight for big things. It was really difficult for me to adapt my game, find solutions and try to put him in trouble, but I am really happy to do it at the end of the match.\" Photo credit: Julian Finney/Getty Images 3) Roland Garros SF, Carlos Alcaraz d. Jannik Sinner, 2-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 In what he called one of the toughest matches of his career, Alcaraz outlasted Sinner in a battle of attrition on Court Philippe-Chatrier. On the way to his first Roland Garros title, the Spaniard twice surged back from a set down and overcame a slow start that saw him trail 4-0 in the opening set. \"You have to find the joy suffering,\" said Alcaraz, who dominated the winner count (65-39) but won two fewer points than the Italian (145-147). \"That is the key, even more here on clay at Roland Garros. Long rallies, four-hour matches, five sets. You have to fight, you have to suffer — but as I told my team, you have to enjoy suffering.\" Sinner struggled with cramp midway though the third set but still found a way to take a two-sets-to-one lead, breaking serve immediately after receiving treatment. There were 10 breaks in the first three sets, but neither man could create a single break point in the fourth until Alcaraz broke through in its final game to force a decider. The Spaniard kept his foot firmly on the pedal to start set five, winning the first three games to cash in on his momentum. As both players struggled to find their very best tennis for sustained stretches, this was a battle of heart and will as much as it was a test of skill. The drama continued until the final ball, with Alcaraz fighting through deuce in each of his last three service games. On his third match point, he sealed his place in the final. 2) Australian Open Final: Jannik Sinner d. Daniil Medvedev, 3-6, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-3 Known for thinking through matches like a chess player, Medvedev knows a thing or two about opening gambits. The all-out attack he sprung from the first ball of this Grand Slam final was one of the more surprising tactical moves of the season, and the unconventional approach took the third seed to the brink of his first Australian Open title. \"I was expecting something different from his side,\" Sinner said. \"So I had this feeling that he might come out a little bit more aggressive. But not this aggressive.\" Medvedev had played three five-setters on the way to the final and decided to let it rip in an effort to shorten points. The typically methodical baseliner unleashed the aggressive side of his game in the first two sets. With Sinner searching for answers, Medvedev fought to deuce on return at 4-4 in set three. But Sinner survived that game then broke for the first time in the match to snatch the set, flipping the match on its head. Medvedev created another break chance at 3-3 in the fourth, but again Sinner escaped before closing out the set with a break in its 10th game. The Italian pulled back in the rallies as the match wore on, inviting lengthier exchanges as he shifted the direction of the match with patience and poise. He finished as a worthy winner, and his first Grand Slam title paved the way for a historic season that saw him debut at World No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings and earn ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours for the first time. Photo credit: Daniel Pockett/Getty Images 1) Roland Garros R3: Novak Djokovic d. Lorenzo Musetti 7-5, 6-7(6), 2-6, 6-3, 6-0 The first of two consecutive comeback, five-set wins for Djokovic, this third-round thriller twisted and turned late into the early morning hours in Paris. The Serbian started well and, after leading by a break early in set two, had a set point on serve in the second-set tie-break. But the complexion of the match quickly changed when Musetti rattled off three straight points to level at one set all. Though midnight had already struck, the 25th-seeded Italian continued what could have been a Cinderella story with a dominant third set. Musetti's majestic one-handed backhand began to get the better of Djokovic's rock-solid two-hander, and the Italian was firmly in the ascendency entering set four. Both players used every bit of Court Philippe-Chatrier, mixing in a steady stream of drop shots and angled attacks that kept the crowd entertained until a record-late finish at 3:07 a.m., breaking the event's latest previous finish of 1:25 a.m. \"It didn't feel great playing him that third set [and] at [the] beginning of the fourth,\" Djokovic said. \"The crowd definitely got me going. I really needed that push, I really needed that energy. At two-all in the fourth, they start chanting my name and I just felt a great new wave of willpower and energy. And I think I was a different player from that moment onwards. I think from that moment I probably lost only one game the rest of the match.\" The one-sided ending was reminiscent of Djokovic's five-set win against Musetti at Roland Garros in 2021. In their first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, the Serbian stormed back from two sets down, winning 16 of the last 17 games before Musetti retired late in the fifth set. On this occasion, the Italian soldiered on but could not stop Djokovic from crossing the finish line after four hours, 29 minutes of memorable all-court action. \"That was perhaps the best match I ever played here,\" Djokovic added, addressing the crowd in French. \"The most exciting. Thank you so much. And now, who's going to sleep? It's impossible to sleep now with all this adrenaline. If you're going to celebrate, I'm coming too!\" Photo credit: AFP/Getty Images [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/best-of-2024-atp-matches",
    "description": "As the 2024 season draws to a close, it is time to reflect on the epic battles and career-defining performances that will stay etched in fans’ memories for years to come. At the heart of the action were some of the Tour’s standout performers across the year: Jannik Sinner, Alexander Zverev and Carlos Alcaraz. As part of our annual season-in-review series, ATPTour.com counts down the finest ATP Tour matches of 2024. [ATP APP] 5) United Cup F, Zverev d. Hurkacz 6-7(3), 7-6(6), 6-4 Donning their country’s colours can often ignite a player’s best tennis. Just ask Zverev and Hubert Hurkacz, who produced a show-stopping clash in the final of this year’s innovative United Cup. Zverev, requiring a win to keep Germany alive, rallied from the brink of defeat to overcome Hurkacz and send the final into a decisive mixed doubles rubber. Facing championship points at 4/6 in the second-set tie-break, Zverev pulled off a flicked forehand passing shot that caught the outer edge of the sideline by millimetres. It proved a pivotal moment in the match. He reeled off three further points to turn it on its head. \"I have absolutely no idea [how I won],” said Zverev. “I saved a match point by hitting a passing shot this much on the line, so this is how tennis goes sometimes. You win and lose by millimetres and today I was lucky enough in a way.” In a match decided by the finest of margins, it was Zverev who held his nerve to secure a vital win. The German would later return to the court with partner Laura Siegemund to seal the title with another stunning victory, kickstarting his 2024 year in emphatic fashion.   4) Hamburg F, Fils d. Zverev 6-3, 3-6, 7-6(1) A title clash between the home favourite and one of the Tour’s brightest prospects was always destined to produce drama, wasn’t it? In the Hamburg final, Zverev’s greater experience and vocal home support did not prove to be enough as Arthur Fils delivered a stunning performance to secure his maiden ATP 500 crown. In the dying embers of a fiery, three-and-a-half-hour battle, Fils was daring enough to attempt an underarm serve facing a break point at 5-5, which electrified the German crowd under the closed roof. That crucial break point was one of 21 that the #NextGenATP star saved throughout the match, according to Infosys ATP Stats, before he dominated the decisive tie-break to seal the win. “When we closed the roof I knew it was going to be just a fight,” said Fils. “You just have to fight until the last point, until the last ball. I think that [I've been] practising for this kind of moment for a long time so I'm really happy to win it.” Fils’ gritty triumph against the then No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings - the biggest of his career - proved to be a catalyst for a stellar run of form at ATP 500 level. Including his titles in Hamburg and Tokyo, the Frenchman won 13 consecutive matches to clinch the ATP 500 Bonus Pool.   3) Monte-Carlo SF, Tsitsipas d. Sinner 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 When it comes to the Rolex Monte-Carlos Masters, Stefanos Tsitsipas rarely puts a foot wrong. In the semi-finals this year, the two-time champion in the Principality found a fitting way to record his first win over a Top 3 opponent since 2022 when he outlasted Jannik Sinner in a high-quality clash. Their two-hour, 40-minute match was defined by gruelling baseline exchanges, which were forced to end through moments of brilliance. Both Tsitsipas and Sinner fired 27 winners, but it was the former who reeled off four consecutive games from 2-4 in the deciding set to complete an epic comeback. “It was tennis at its highest level that I have been able to play,” said Tsitsipas. “Jannik was an extremely difficult opponent and it can be seen throughout the year so far. He has been very consistent and I could see that throughout today with his game.” Tsitsipas would go on to defeat Casper Ruud in the championship match to clinch his third title at the ATP Masters 1000 event, becoming just the fifth player to achieve this feat (after Nadal, Borg, Muster and Nastase).   2) Cincinnati SF, Sinner d. Zverev 7-6(9), 5-7, 7-6(4) Sinner was heading into his semi-final encounter in Cincinnati with former champion Zverev having lost each of their previous four Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings, but the Italian battled through a hip niggle to secure a thrilling victory. In a pendulum-swinging, three-hour, seven-minute clash, which featured rain in the first set, Sinner displayed remarkable resilience to cross the line. Zverev let slip a break lead in the first set as well as two set points in the tie-break before Sinner took the lead. Despite Sinner’s edge, little separated the two and the German fought back with light fading in Cincinnati. Sinner summoned the energy to unleash a forehand return winner to bring up two match points in the deciding-set tie-break, which he converted on the second attempt. “Sometimes you have to play a bit with the gut feeling, and I think this today was my strength,” said Sinner, who went on to clinch his sixth ATP Masters 1000 title with his triumph over Frances Tiafoe in the final. “[There were] some ups and downs, which can happen, especially when you play [for] more than three hours. It was a good match, I think for both of us.”   1) Beijing F, Alcaraz d. Sinner 6-7(6), 6-4, 7-6(3) With the rivalry between Carlos Alcaraz and Sinner already brimming with spectacular encounters, the Beijing final was yet another testament to the stature of their duel. Through a high-quality display of bruising ball-striking paired with exquisite feel at the net, the two young stars pushed each other to their limits. Sinner had established himself as the standout contender on hard courts in 2024, but Alcaraz proved a stubborn obstacle for the Italian, who won their two previous Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings. Eager to spoil Sinner’s 16-match winning streak, Alcaraz’s nerve and skill came to the fore in a breathtaking showdown. After clawing back from a set deficit and letting slip a break lead in the final set, it seemed the final was becoming further out of reach for Alcaraz, who trailed 0/3 in the decisive tie-break. Yet the Spaniard had other ideas, stringing together seven consecutive points to seal a gutsy three-hour, 21-minute victory - the longest match in tournament history. “I never lost hope,\" said Alcaraz. \"Honestly I knew that [when I started it] that every tie-break Jannik plays is almost to his side. I thought that in the third set, I’m not going to lie, three-love down, two mini breaks for him. So I didn’t lose hope, but I thought, ‘Okay, I have to give everything that I have just to try to give myself the opportunity to be close.’” With the triumph Alcaraz took a 6-4 lead in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, marking the first time either of them had won three consecutive matches against the other. Sinner’s defeat to Alcaraz in Beijing, however, proved to be his sole loss in 27 matches from Cincinnati onwards in a stellar end to the 2024 season.   [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
