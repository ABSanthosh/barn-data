    "description": "The Fayez Sarofim \u0026 Co. U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship semi-final between top seed Tommy Paul and Jenson Brooksby has resumed following multiple weather delays. Brooksby, the former No. 33 in the PIF ATP Rankings, led Paul 7-6(5), 2-3 entering the most recent delay, which lasted more than three hours. The match was originally scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. local time and restarted after 7 p.m. in Houston.   Brooksby tallied five consecutive points from 2/5 in the first-set tie-break to win the opener. The 24-year-old displayed his superb defensive skills and shotmaking ability, redirecting the ball with ease. Brooksby committed just 10 unforced errors in the first set, compared to Paul’s 22. In an all-American Saturday lineup, Paul is aiming to extend his perfect 3-0 record in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Brooksby. Following the conclusion of the first semi-final, second seed Frances Tiafoe meets fourth seed Brandon Nakashima. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Petr Nouza and Patrik Rikl could hardly have been more emphatic in winning their first ATP Tour title. The Czech duo on Saturday completed a perfect week at the Grand Prix Hassan II, where they downed top seeds Hugo Nys and Edouard Roger-Vasselin 6-3, 6-4. Nouza and Rikl did not drop a set across their four matches in Marrakech. In the championship match, the unseeded Nouza and Rikl saved all three break points they faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats. They are the first all-Czech team to win an ATP Tour title since Roman Jebavy/Jiri Vesely triumphed in 2017 in Istanbul. As a result of their title run in Morocco, Nouza and Rikl have jumped 16 spots to 17th in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Rankings. The 26-year-olds are now 10-9 as a team at Tour-level, a tally which includes a championship-match run in Stockholm last October. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
