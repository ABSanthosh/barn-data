Let‚Äôs take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Marin Cilic, who has not competed since November, provided an update on his knee injury Thursday. The former No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings revealed that he suffered minor setbacks during preseason training, which prevented him from beginning his season alongside the rest of the ATP Tour‚Äôs stars. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, I had a few minor setbacks come up during my preseason training and want to make sure those are 100% ready before I get back to competing. I‚Äôm doing everything I can to get back on tour as soon as possible and hope to join team Croatia in Osijek for the Davis Cup! üá≠üá∑,‚Äù he wrote on Instagram. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Marin CÃåilicÃÅ (@marincilic) [ATP APP] Currently No. 181 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Cilic has not competed since November 2024, when he lost to Jiri Lehecka in the second round of the Belgrade Open. In September, the 36-year-old Croatian won the Hangzhou Open (No. 777) to become the lowest-ranked champion in ATP Tour history (since 1990). Cilic, a 21-time tour-level champion, underwent knee surgery in May 2024. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "The ATP recently filmed a special feature with Novak Djokovic in which the former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings answered questions from his peers, including Jannik Sinner and Alexander Zverev. One of those questions has proven timely. Zverev asked Djokovic: ‚ÄúNovak, are you finally going to let me win a Slam myself?‚Äù Of course the two-time Nitto ATP Finals champion was joking, and he was not the only player who asked a similar question. ‚ÄúCome on guys! I don‚Äôt know what to say,‚Äù Djokovic said, cracking a laugh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to have to disappoint all of you, because you‚Äôre going to see quite a bit of me in the next several years. I have big plans. I have still a lot to win.‚Äù Zverev will hope some of that winning does not come at his expense on Friday. If the 27-year-old is to claim his first major title at the Australian Open, he will need to battle past Djokovic in the semi-finals. Djokovic leads the pair‚Äôs Lexus ATP Head2Head series 8-4, including 3-0 at Grand Slam tournaments. Their most recent clash at a major came in the 2021 US Open semi-finals, where Djokovic needed five sets to triumph. To see the other questions ATP stars asked Djokovic and how the 37-year-old responded, watch the full feature at the top of the article. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
