    "description": "Nick Kyrgios is gearing up to make a comeback on home soil. Speaking on a panel at SXSW (South By Southwest) in Sydney on Thursday, the Aussie confirmed his participation at the 2025 Australian Open. ‚ÄúI will be playing the Australian Open this summer,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI just miss being out there playing in front of a home crowd. We‚Äôve got such a crowd of guys at the moment like Alex de Minaur playing amazing tennis.‚Äù Struggling with knee and wrist injuries for the past 16 months, Kyrgios has been out of action for almost two seasons. Last year, he played a single tour-level match at the BOSS OPEN in Stuttgart and lost to Wu Yibing. ‚ÄúThe injury I had was brutal ‚Ä¶ The surgeon said I probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to play again,‚Äù Kyrgios shared. ‚ÄúBut I said whatever, just try and get me another two to three years of my career ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs been a brutal last couple of years, but just being out there to play in front of a home crowd ‚Ä¶ I just want to be out there, lighting up the crowd and playing in front of my own country. ‚ÄúWhether it is good or bad, it will certainly be a lot of fun, for sure. I am looking forward to it ‚Ä¶ My only motivation to come back and play is to try and win a grand slam, and I‚Äôll give it one more shot.‚Äù [ATP APP] Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley looks forward to having the home favorite back at Melbourne Park. ‚ÄúWe love to have Nick coming back playing in 2025 ‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs back out there practicing,‚Äù Tiley said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs fully expecting to play, and we expect to see Nick playing‚Ä¶ We‚Äôll ensure Nick‚Äôs out there playing in the main draw. ‚ÄúHis preparation, we know he‚Äôs doing more than he‚Äôs done before, we know that he wants to do it, we know that he‚Äôs mentally preparing to get ready to play in January. He‚Äôs got to be physically healthy to do that.‚Äù - with assistance from Tennis Australia. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Faced with a dialled-in opponent and with a final spot on the line, Jiri Lehecka opted for all-out attack on Saturday night at the European Open. The fifth-seeded Czech was rewarded for his courage with a 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 semi-final triumph against Marcos Giron at the indoor hard-court ATP 250. Lehecka responded emphatically to a mid-match surge from Giron by breaking the American‚Äôs serve twice in the deciding set en route to a one-hour, 57-minute victory. ‚ÄúAll the best to Marcos, he played incredible tennis, especially in the second set,‚Äù said Lehecka in his on-court interview. ‚ÄúA few times I was speechless with what he was able to produce, so I‚Äôm very happy with the win, so happy to be through and today it was a hard-fought battle. ‚ÄúAfter the second set, when I thought I wasn‚Äôt playing bad but he was just playing incredible from the back of the baseline, I knew I had to use every chance I had to push forward and to be aggressive. His second serve was the only chance I had to do it, so I tried to use that and it worked well.‚Äù Lehecka converted three of six break points he earned against Giron, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to book his spot in his third tour-level championship match. The Adelaide champion is the first Czech to reach an indoor ATP Tour final since his former coach Tomas Berdych won the Stockholm title in 2015. [ATP APP] A familiar face will await Lehecka in Sunday‚Äôs final: Roberto Bautista Agut. The Spaniard earlier eased past Hugo Gaston 6-3, 6-4 to reach is 23rd tour-level title match, and his first since he reached a final in Adelaide in January 2023. Bautista Agut notched a break in each set to halt the inspired run of Gaston, who had downed second seed Alex de Minaur in the quarter-finals. In fine form üíØ@BautistaAgut takes down Gaston 6-3 6-4 to advance to championship Sunday. @EuroTennisOpen | #EuropeanOpen pic.twitter.com/bbHNuORoqx‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) October 19, 2024 ‚ÄúMy last final was in Adelaide last year and it means a lot to me to be in [another] final,‚Äù said Bautista Agut, who has risen 12 spots to No. 48 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings as a result of his run in Belgium so far. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been working very hard after the injury and to enjoy on the court, like I have this week. It‚Äôs why I love tennis and why I keep practising very hard. I‚Äôm very happy.‚Äù The Spaniard will step on court against Lehecka with a 3-1 lead in the pair‚Äôs Lexus ATP Head2Head series. The pair has split two meetings in the past six weeks, with Bautista Agut beating Lehecka at September‚Äôs Davis Cup Finals Group Stage, and Lehecka later prevailing in a second-round clash in Beijing.
