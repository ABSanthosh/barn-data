It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Novak Djokovic recorded another eye-catching personal milestone on Saturday at Roland Garros, where he moved past Austrian qualifier Filip Misolic 6-3, 6-4, 6-2. By reaching the fourth round, Djokovic moved to 99 match wins at the major, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, equalling his best mark at a single Grand Slam tournament. The Serbian has also clinched 99 victories at the Australian Open, where he is a record 10-time champion. Djokovic was in control throughout the two-hour, nine-minute encounter on Court Philippe-Chatrier against Misolic. He redirected the 23-year-old's pace and stepped in the court to up the aggression on big points to advance to the last 16 in Paris for the 16th consecutive year. Djokovic's W-L Record Per Grand Slam Event  Event  W-L  Titles  Australian Open  99-10  10  Roland Garros  99-16  3  Wimbledon  97-12  7  US Open  90-14  4 A three-time Roland Garros titlist, the 38-year-old is aiming to add to his tally this fortnight and clinch a record-extending 25th major. Yet to drop a set in the French capital, Djokovic will next meet British lefty Cameron Norrie, who beat countryman Jacob Fearnley 6-3, 7-6(1), 6-2 to reach the fourth round at the major for the first time. Djokovic will take a 5-0 Lexus ATP Head2Head series lead against Norrie into the match, having beaten the 29-year-old in Geneva last week. Djokovic suffered opening-round defeats on clay in Monte-Carlo and Madrid in April but re-found form at the ATP 250 event in Geneva, when he defeated Hubert Hurkacz in the final to clinch his 100th tour-level title The No. 6 in the PIF ATP Rankings has looked comfortable through his opening three matches in Paris, having beaten Mackenzie McDonald in the first round and Corentin Moutet in the second round. Last year at this venue, he won the gold medal at the Paris Olympics and will be hoping to make more history in the next week. Misolic was playing in the third round at a major for the first time. The 23-year-old was facing Djokovic for the first time but had spent time with the former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings in the past, training with the Serbian ahead of the US Open last year. Misolic leaves France up 13 spots to No. 140 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, having defeated Buyunchaokete and Denis Shapovalov. Did You Know? The only player to have earned more wins at Roland Garros than Djokovic is record 14-time champion Rafael Nadal, who holds a 112-4 record. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
