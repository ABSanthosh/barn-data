    "description": "Just two days after Stefanos Tsitsipas announced his split with Goran Ivanisevic, the Greek was on the practice court Friday in Toronto with father Apostolos Tsitsipas coaching him. The former No. 3 player in the PIF ATP Rankings was working hard under the hot Canadian sun, enjoying an afternoon training session with Karen Khachanov. The two stars, who have met in 10 Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings, spent extended time in crosscourt rallies. The 2018 National Bank Open Presented by Rogers finalist will be eager for a deep run following a 19-13 start to his season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. The 26-year-old explained his split on social media Wednesday. \"Working with Goran Ivanisevic was brief but an intense experience and a truly valuable chapter in my journey,\" Tsitsipas wrote in a statement posted on his Instagram story. \"I'm thankful for the time, effort and energy he dedicated to me and my team.\" Ivanisevic told media outlet HRT that he spoke to Tsitsipas this week, bringing their short-lived player-coach relationship to a close. “We had a nice chat, it's something that's been going on for the last ten days, there's no bad blood, we thanked each other,” Ivanisevic said. “He decided to try again with his father. I honestly, most sincerely mean this, the only person who can coach him is his dad. He played the best tennis with him, he knows him best, it's a family project.” Tsitsipas is the 23rd seed in Toronto, where he will take on Australian Christopher O'Connell or a qualifier in the second round.

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/medvedev-moutet-washington-2025-friday-suspension",
    "description": "French lucky loser Corentin Moutet handled a mid-match suspension due to lightning and then took advantage of three Daniil Medvedev double faults in his final service game at the Mubadala Citi DC Open on Friday to advance to his first semi-final above ATP 250 level. After two hours and 15 minutes of action in the gruelling Washington heat, play was halted due to lightning in the local area with the 26-year-old leading Medvedev 1-6, 6-4, 5-4. After a delay of an hour, Moutet returned to court to immediately break Medvedev’s serve and seal a dramatic 1-6, 6-4, 6-4 triumph after two hours and 25 minutes. The World No. 14 unraveled under pressure, coughing up three double faults in the resumed game, including one on the very first point, handing Moutet a golden opportunity that he seized. On his third match point, Moutet won one of the points of the match to capture his fourth Top 20 win on a hard court. After blocking back a return, the 26-year-old scrambled to the net to dig up a Medvedev drop shot. The eighth seed on the full stretch found the edge of his racquet to hit an overhead that clipped the top of the net, allowing Moutet to flick the ball back and then find a majestic lob. Medvedev recovered to the baseline to hit a forehand, but Moutet demonstrated great hand skills at the net to hit flick a pickup off his toes before he found a backhand volley on the full stretch. Medvedev pushed the resulting ball wide, with Moutet collapsing to the court after triumphing. In humid temperatures, Medvedev struck 10 winners in a dominate opening set to lead. However, Moutet, using his court craft and agility, rallied to win the second set and then came out firing upon the resumption to take advantage of Medvedev errors in the closing stages. The lefty is up 13 spots to No. 46 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings following his win and is set to rise to a career-high on Monday. Both players struggled in the hot conditions, with Medvedev receiving a medical timeout mid game at 2-4, 15/15 in the second set due to heat stress. A new way to water the flowers 🌹💧@moutet99 #MubadalaCitiDCOpen pic.twitter.com/9Fkgdo1b4F— Tennis TV (@TennisTV) July 25, 2025 Medvedev, seeking his first title since Rome in 2023, was aiming to reach his 60th tour-level semi-final. Moutet, who is now 1-1 against Medvedev in the pair’s Lexus ATP Head2Head series, was playing in his maiden ATP Tour quarter-final above 250 level. He will face Alex de Minaur or Brandon Nakashima in the semi-finals. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
