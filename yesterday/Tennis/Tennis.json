The fifth-seeded duo eased past Hugo Nys and Edouard Roger-Vasselin 6-3, 6-3 to reach the quarter-finals at the hard-court ATP Masters 1000. Mektic and Venus converted three of nine break points they earned, according to Infosys ATP Stats, in their 72-minute triumph at Hard Rock Stadium. After winning the title in their second tournament as a team in January in Auckland, Mektic and Venus arrived in Miami off the back of three straight defeats. The Croatian-Kiwi pair will next take on third seeds Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori or the in-form Christian Harrison and Evan King. Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool were also early winners on Sunday in Miami. The all-British team fended off Top 50 singles stars Pedro Martinez and Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard 7-5, 6-4 to set a quarter-final showdown with Yuki Bhambri/Nuno Borges or Jamie Murray/Adam Pavlasek.

    "description": "Novak Djokovic set one record on Sunday at the 2025 Miami Open presented by Itau. Could there be more to come? The Serbian defeated Camilo Ugo Carabelli 6-1, 7-6(1) to book his fourth-round spot at Hard Rock Stadium. It was Djokovic‚Äôs 411th match win at Masters 1000 events, moving him clear of his great rival Rafael Nadal for the most in series history (since 1990). He also remained on course for a record seventh title at the hard-court event in Florida with his triumph against lucky loser Carabelli. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm honoured to have another milestone, another record broken,‚Äù said Djokovic. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always something on the line, pretty much every time I play, and of course that motivates me to do well at tournaments.‚Äù Djokovic raced to the first set in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Carabelli and appeared to have taken complete control when he broke his opponent‚Äôs serve in the third game of the second. Yet the Argentine dug deep to immediately reclaim the break and held firm behind serve from then on to force a tie-break. There was little Ugo Carabelli could do to cling on in the tie-break, however, as the 99-time tour-level titlist Djokovic raised his level to complete his one-hour, 45-minute win. The Serbian finished the match having won 80 per cent (39/49) of points behind his first serve, according to Infosys ATP Stats. NOVAK STANDS ALONE ‚òùÔ∏èü´°@DjokerNole breaks the record for the most ATP Masters 1000 match wins in series history, defeating Ugo Carabelli 6-1 7-6(1)!@MiamiOpen | #MiamiOpen pic.twitter.com/HV3lNOAUEJ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) March 23, 2025 ‚ÄúI started off really well, 6-1, very similar to the first match two days ago,\" reflected Djokovic. \"Things got complicated in the second. I broke his serve, he rebroke my serve, and then we were kind of going toe to toe. I had some chances at 4-4 but I think it was fair to take the second set to a tie-break. Then, like two days ago, a perfect tie-break. Great serving when I needed to, and overall just pleased to get through.‚Äù Djokovic arrived in Miami on a three-match losing streak, but the 37-year-old is yet to drop a set after two matches of his first Miami appearance since 2019. The timing of his return to winning ways could prove to be particularly convenient given Carlos Alcaraz's shock opening-round defeat to David Goffin: Djokovic and Alcaraz were seeded to meet in the quarter-finals at Hard Rock Stadium. Regardless, Djokovic will next concentrate on his next opponent in Miami, Lorenzo Musetti. The Italian earlier overcame Felix Auger-Aliassime 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 to reach the fourth round for the second consecutive year. The World No. 16 Musetti earned back-to-back wins for only the second time this season by seeing off Auger-Aliassime after two hours and 26 minutes. He converted four of 14 break points he earned against the Canadian en route to his first Top 20 win since last October. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
