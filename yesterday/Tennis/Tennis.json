    "description": "The tennis community is rallying around Americans Trevor Svajda and Zachary Svajda as their father, Tom Svajda, battles cancer. An exhibition event featuring James Blake and Brandon Nakashima will take place on Saturday, 7 December, with all proceeds directed towards Tom's medical expenses. The event, hosted at Rancho Santa Fe Tennis Club in San Diego, will feature the 22-year-old Zach partnering his brother, Trevor — a standout college player at Southern Methodist University in Dallas — in a doubles match against former World No. 4 Blake and 2022 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion Nakashima. \"This event holds a special place in my heart,\" said Zach, who climbed to No. 102 in the PIF ATP Rankings earlier this year.. \"My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, and our journey through his treatment and fight has been incredibly challenging. Supporting him through this has been one of the most difficult yet meaningful experiences of my life.\" Zach's younger brother, Trevor, explained how important the moment is for their family. “This occasion is incredibly meaningful to me, particularly because our dad is going through a difficult period,” said Trevor, who in 2023 competed in US Open qualifying after reaching the final of the USTA Boys' 18s National Championships. “The commitment of everyone attending to show their love and support truly makes a difference and means everything to us.” [ATP APP] Tom, who has worked as a tennis coach for more than 30 years, is a beloved figure in the San Diego community and beyond. Tickets to the exhibition can be purchased by clicking here. Additional donations can be made by visiting the Svajda’s GoFundMe. Blake's father, Thomas Blake Sr., lost his battle with gastric cancer in 2004. Money raised by James Blake Foundation supports the Thomas Blake Sr. Fund at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.  “I decided to participate because the tennis community is very small. It is a lifetime sport and also a family sport. I played with my parents and Zach and Trevor played with their dad. It is a sport that can be enjoyed as a family, and when a part of the tennis family is hurting, the whole community is hurting,\" said Blake. “We feel for Tom so much and want to do what we can to help the family and raise some money. So the time and energy for me to be a part of it is my pleasure. I hope it makes a meaningful difference.” Nakashima added: “I’ve known Tom and the Svajda family for more than a decade since my junior tennis days competing with Zachary. Tom has been so committed to helping his kids pursue their passion. Zachary and I have a great friendship. We train together, motivate each other, and push each other through the challenges of the tour. \"For me, it is so fulfilling to use my platform to lift up their spirits during this very difficult time. I love to give back to the community whenever I have an opportunity to do so.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "title": "Murray's early impression of Djokovic: 'None of those guys matter, it's only Novak'",
    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/gilbert-on-murray-djokovic-partnership-2024",
    "description": "Brad Gilbert remembers asking Andy Murray an important question in 2006, when he began coaching the Scot. Gilbert went through a list of players, pressing Murray on which opponents gave him the most trouble. Nearly two decades later, Gilbert still recalls Murray’s response. “I remember him saying, ‘None of those guys matter, it’s only Novak,’” Gilbert told ATPTour.com. In a full-circle moment, Murray is now teaming with his rival Djokovic, coaching the Serbian in the off season and through the Australian Open. According to Gilbert, it is a fitting move. “I kind of sensed that Novak was going to do something. You didn’t know what he was going to do, but you kind of sensed that he probably needed something, and something to motivate him. And obviously he goes way back with Andy,” Gilbert said. “Andy knows a lot about Novak, knows a lot about the players who Novak is going to be chasing. But I think more than anything, where Novak is, you’ve got these two huge, young guys now [Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz] who have just really elevated and I think Novak probably feels like he needs a little bit and I think most importantly, needs that motivation.” Wasn’t on our 2024 bingo card… But SO here for it 😎@andy_murray | @DjokerNole pic.twitter.com/e9T2eFW25i — ATP Tour (@atptour) November 23, 2024 Murray, who retired at the Paris Olympics earlier this year, and 99-time tour-level titlist Djokovic clashed 36 times in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. The Belgrade native won 25 of those meetings. They battled on the world’s biggest stages, including in seven major finals. Gilbert, former No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings, also knows what it is like to make a quick transition from the court to the coach's box. He retired as a player in 1994, the same year he began coaching Andre Agassi. Instantly, Gilbert learned a valuable coaching lesson. “You’re the coach, looking through the lens of the player who you’re coaching. I was like, ‘I would do X, Y and Z, but Andre plays nothing like me, so I can’t think about what I would do. I have to think about what Andre needed to do’.” Born one week apart in May 1987, Djokovic and Murray are not the first pair of former No. 1s in the PIF ATP Rankings to join forces. In fact, Murray is the third former No. 1 to be in Djokovic’s corner. The Serbian has also worked with Agassi and Boris Becker. With an entire offseason to refine new strategies and tactics, Djokovic's early season will be particularly exciting. The 37-year-old will begin his 2025 campaign in Brisbane. “The first thing I’ll want to do when I’m in Australia is just go watch Murray and Novak practise,” Gilbert said. “It will be interesting, do they practise together? Is he practising with a practice partner? And [I want to see] if I notice anything different early in the first round. As a coach myself and a former player, I’m kind of fascinated seeing if there is something different right away.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
