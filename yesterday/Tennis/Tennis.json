    "description": "The wide slice serve is a CRITICAL tool to have in your tool box. It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/shelton-serve-indian-wells-2025-saturday",
    "description": "Ben Shelton has rapidly established himself as one of the ATP Tour’s most electrifying young stars in recent years, and his booming lefty serve is a major reason why. The 22-year-old American has put himself in the limelight by clocking jaw-dropping speeds off the racquet. But even Shelton learned on Saturday night at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells that raw power alone doesn’t always win the point. Tennis fans will remember Shelton’s firepower at the 2023 US Open, where he uncorked a 149 mph ace down the T — the fastest serve of the tournament — against countryman Tommy Paul. But in his second-round clash with Argentine Mariano Navone in Indian Wells on Saturday, Shelton took it a step further by hitting the 150 mph mark with a stinging serve through the middle. The problem? Navone’s reactions. Navone blocked the body serve with a chipped forehand return, allowing him into the point. Shelton continued on the front foot by pulling Navone out wide, but the Argentine landed a pinpoint backhand at his opponent's feet, quickly rushing up to an attempted half volley and picking Shelton off with a forehand winner. Shelton ultimately got the last laugh, however. The No. 12 in the PIF ATP Rankings claimed a 6-3, 6-2 victory over the Argentine and set a third-round meeting with 22nd seed Karen Khachanov, which will be their maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head contest.

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/medvedev-michelsen-indian-wells-2025",
    "description": "Two-time finalist Daniil Medvedev advanced to the fourth round at the BNP Paribas Open after Alex Michelsen was forced to retire just 10 minutes into their maiden meeting on Sunday due to illness. Medvedev took a medical timeout himself to deal with a nosebleed in the second game, but upon resumption at 0-2, Michelsen called the match. The fifth-seeded Medvedev made an impressive start by defeating Buyunchaokete on Friday for his 200th hard-court win since 2020. The 29-year-old is now 10-5 on the season and is one victory away from a fourth consecutive ATP Tour quarter-final. “I played a very good first round, so I was looking forward to playing Alex,” said Medvedev. “I didn’t see him [play] too much, but I like the way he plays and I think it could [have been] an interesting match. It’s unfortunate for him to get food poisoning, or something like this, but it happens. “It’s not easy to play here, always tough conditions. Before the tournament I was starting to lose [my rhythm], but I got it back after the first match. I’m starting to feel better and better here.” In the fourth round, Medvedev will face 10th seed Tommy Paul, who earlier ousted 2021 champion Cameron Norrie 6-3, 7-5 to earn his 50th ATP Masters 1000 win. The 27-year-old joined Taylor Fritz as the only active American players to reach this milestone.  Following Michelsen's retirement, the third-round match between Holger Rune and Ugo Humbert has been moved from Stadium 4 to Stadium 1, where it will start not before 3:30 p.m. local time. Michelsen has also withdrawn from the doubles event, in which he partnered Ben Shelton. The American duo has been replaced by Alexander Erler and Constantin Frantzen. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
