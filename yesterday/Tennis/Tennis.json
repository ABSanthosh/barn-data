Let‚Äôs take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Tommy Paul will make his Top 10 debut in the PIF ATP Rankings this coming week at the Dallas Open. On Saturday afternoon, the defending champion learned his draw. The third seed will take on fellow American Jenson Brooksby in the pair‚Äôs third Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. ‚ÄúThe field is definitely super strong. I knew it was going to be. Everyone wants to come play here,‚Äù Paul, the new World No. 9, said. ‚ÄúIn terms of Americans, we absolutely love playing in the States. It‚Äôs our favourite time of the year, this swing and also the US Open series, so we‚Äôre all excited to play here. We love Dallas and we love playing in Dallas.‚Äù One year ago when Paul lifted the trophy at the Dallas Open, then an ATP 250 event, it was held at Southern Methodist University. Now an ATP 500, the tournament is being played at The Star, the world headquarters and practice facility of the NFL‚Äôs Dallas Cowboys. ‚ÄúThe courts feel great,‚Äù Paul said. ‚ÄúObviously I have great memories last year here and everything has improved a tonne, so I‚Äôm really happy to be back.‚Äù [ATP APP] Ironically, Paul wore a Philadelphia Eagles hat to the draw ceremony in front of Cowboys‚Äô faithful. ‚ÄúThe colours are great,‚Äù Paul said of the blue-and-gray courts, replicating the colours of the Cowboys, the Eagles‚Äô rival. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre better on the court than on a football field, that‚Äôs for sure.‚Äù Three of the Top 10 players in the world are in the field. Top seed Taylor Fritz will open against Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech and second seed Casper Ruud will play Marcos Giron. One of the most interesting first-round clashes pits sixth seed Tomas Machac against former World No. 4 Kei Nishikori, who Saturday led Japan to Davis Cup victory on home soil against Great Britain. Seventh seed Alex Michelsen will face former Top 10 star Cameron Norrie. Five of the eight seeds in the draw are American. Fourth seed Ben Shelton will take on Aleksandar Vukic in a rematch of the 2022 Champaign ATP Challenger Tour final (won by Shelton) and fifth seed Frances Tiafoe plays Japanese Taro Daniel.

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/auger-aliassime-de-jong-montpellier-2025-sf",
    "description": "Felix Auger-Aliassime is reigniting his indoor form this week at the Open Occitanie in Montpellier, where he is into his second ATP Tour final of 2025. The second seed delivered a clinical display when under pressure to oust Jesper de Jong 6-4, 7-6(4) on Saturday and reach his first indoor championship match since he won Basel in 2023. Auger-Aliassime recovered from a break deficit in the second set, where he also saved two set points, to move into a 17th career final (6-10) after two hours, two minutes. ‚ÄúThe second set was very tricky, up and down,‚Äù said Auger-Aliassime. ‚ÄúI started serving less good and kept him in the match, but in the end I was glad I was able to come back and win in two sets. Not every match is going to be a straight road forward, so to pull it through in straight sets is a great thing.\" Taking care of business üíº@felixtennis takes down de Jong to record his 52nd indoor win since the start of the 2022 season üò±@OpenOccitanie | #openoccitanie pic.twitter.com/iT42brFfUs ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) February 1, 2025 After suffering a back injury at the end of last season, which forced him out of the Rolex Paris Masters, Auger-Aliassime has begun the year with a renewed vigour. The 24-year-old won his sixth ATP Tour title at the Adelaide International in January and holds a 9-2 record in 2025 heading into the Montpellier final on Sunday. He is seeking his first multi-title season since he lifted four trophies, all indoors, in 2022. In Saturday‚Äôs semi-final clash with De Jong, Auger-Aliassime held his nerve when it mattered most. The Canadian No. 1 lost his way in an error-strewn second set, where he was broken to love and forced to save two set points, but produced an emphatic response in the tie-break to seal a straight-sets victory. ‚Äú[I was] very focused until the very end, until the last ball. I have lost matches like this where you miss the forehand and all of a sudden you're in a third set,\" said Auger-Aliassime, who squandered a two-sets-to-love lead against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in the second round at the Australian Open last month. \"So I tried to stay calm and very focused until the end.‚Äù In Sunday‚Äôs final, Auger-Aliassime will face qualifier Aleksandar Kovacevic, who stunned top seed and World No. 10 Andrey Rublev 7-5, 6-4 for the biggest win of his career. In a match dominated by baseline exchanges, Kovacevic produced consistent depth from both wings to irritate his opponent en route to reaching his maiden tour-level final. ‚ÄúIt seems like every day we have the same conversation about me playing the best match I ever played,‚Äù Kovacevic said in his on-court interview. ‚ÄúMy level has definitely been good this week. Andrey is an incredible player, I have been watching him for years. Just stepping on the court with someone like this is a privilege. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre an underdog, playing a Top 10 opponent like that, you‚Äôre a lot more free. You have to go for it against these guys. I‚Äôm honoured to be on court with them, but if you don‚Äôt show up they're going to take it, just like they always do.‚Äù ¬† With his 95-minute win over Rublev, Kovacevic climbs to No. 75 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, three spots off his career high. The 26-year-old produced a gutsy display throughout his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Rublev, but was particularly fired up in the second set. Kovacevic saved a break point with a big second serve in the ninth game before reeling off four of the last five points on return in the following game to seal victory. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
