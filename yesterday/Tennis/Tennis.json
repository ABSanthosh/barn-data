    "description": "Arthur Fils let loose in the face of cramps to earn a thrilling third-round victory Monday at the Miami Open presented by Itau. The 20-year-old Frenchman won the final five games to claim a 7-6(11), 5-7, 6-2 triumph against Frances Tiafoe at the hard-court ATP Masters 1000. Fils, who let slip two match points in the second set, rallied from a break down at 1-2 in the decider by changing tactics to try and hit winners as soon as he could. ‚ÄúIt was very tough. When I got into the third set, I was cramping and I couldn‚Äôt find the rhythm anymore,‚Äù explained Fils, who will play top seed Alexander Zverev in the fourth round. ‚ÄúMy serve was tough and I couldn‚Äôt jump, so I tried to relax and play as fast as I could and hit as strong as I could. Somehow it worked. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to work every day, that‚Äôs for sure. Maybe once or twice out of 10 it‚Äôs going to work, and today it worked. I‚Äôm very happy about it, but Frances is a hell of a champion. It‚Äôs the first time we have played, and I hope we are going to have many more great battles.‚Äù An EPIC in the 305 ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•@ArthurFils1 becomes the first Frenchman to reach the fourth round of both Indian Wells and Miami in the same season since Jeremy Chardy in 2018!@MiamiOpen | #MiamiOpen pic.twitter.com/KCGMxGNf4n‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) March 24, 2025 In a match that ebbed and flowed throughout, Fils saved six set points in the first set before claiming it 13/11 in the joint-longest tie-break of the 2025 season so far. He then missed his first two match points at 5-4 in the second set, before Tiafoe reeled off a three-game streak to send the pair‚Äôs maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head to a decider. The home favourite Tiafoe, who was aiming to secure back-to-back tour-level wins for the first time since he reached the US Open semi-finals last September, appeared to have taken control of the third set with a break in the third game. Then came Fils‚Äô late barrage, however, during which the Frenchman notched three consecutive breaks of serve of his own with a series of searing blows off both wings. Fils converted four of 14 break points he earned in the two-hour, 55-minute encounter, according to Infosys ATP Stats. The Frenchman is now up two spots to No. 16 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, boosting his chances of setting a new career high after Miami, while he has now also reached the fourth round in his three most recent Masters 1000 events. ‚ÄúIt means a lot for sure,‚Äù said Fils, who has achieved that feat across Paris (last season), Indian Wells and Miami. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the first time at the Masters that I‚Äôve reached the fourth round twice [in a year]. In Indian Wells it was very good, and I was thinking that this week was going to be tough. ‚ÄúI was very focused to play the opening round against [Gabriel] Diallo. He got injured, and I‚Äôm sorry about it, and then today I found a way. Now we are in the fourth round, I‚Äôm going to play against the top seed, and let‚Äôs see how it goes.‚Äù [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/zverev-thompson-miami-2025-monday",
    "description": "Former finalist Alexander Zverev shook off a sluggish start on Monday to remain on track at the Miami Open presented by Itau and break an ATP Masters 1000 record. The top seed produced a clinical response to his error-strewn start to prevail 7-5, 6-4 against Australia‚Äôs Jordan Thompson and reach the fourth round in Miami for the fifth time. Zverev rode a mid-match surge in form, during which he won eight of the next nine games from 1-4 in the first set, to improve to 3-2 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Thompson. ‚ÄúJordan made it difficult for me for sure,‚Äù said Zverev, who is now 19-9 in Miami. ‚ÄúHe's a quality player. When you're in rhythm, he knows how to break [it] a little bit. So he did extremely well today. I'm happy with my level from 1-4 onwards, losing just one game out of [the next] nine.‚Äù By sealing his 81st Masters 1000 win since the start of 2020, Zverev broke his tie with Stefanos Tsitsipas for the most recorded by any player in that period. Since 2020, he has won four titles (Rome and Paris last year, Madrid and Cincinnati in 2021) and reached two further finals. ATP Masters 1000 Win Leaders Since 2020: ¬†Alexander Zverev ¬†81 ¬†Stefanos Tsitsipas¬† ¬†80 ¬†Daniil Medvedev ¬†78 ¬†Jannik Sinner¬† ¬†77 ¬†Hubert Hurkacz ¬†69 The No. 37 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Thompson reeled off the first three games to spark hopes of an upset at Hard Rock Stadium. Yet once Zverev had found his range, there was no way past. The World No. 2 executed a sublime drop volley in the 11th game before going on to break and let out a mighty roar. While Zverev‚Äôs first serve was typically sound, winning 76 per cent (32/42) of points behind it, his second serve proved key. The 23-time tour-level titlist dropped just three of the 13 second-serve points for a winning percentage of 77, according to Infosys ATP Stats. ¬† For Zverev, who fell in his Indian Wells opener to Tallon Griekspoor, his third-round win in Miami marks just the second time he has earned back-to-back tour-level victories since reaching his third major final at the Australian Open in January. The 27-year-old reached the 2018 final in Miami, where he lost to John Isner, and will next continue his campaign against Arthur Fils. The Frenchman overcame cramping in the deciding set to defeat Frances Tiafoe 7-6(11), 5-7, 6-2 in a thrilling third-round clash. The third-seeded Taylor Fritz avenged his recent Dallas loss to Denis Shapovalov by prevailing 7-5, 6-3 to seal his fourth-round spot in Miami. The American No. 1 let slip a 5-2 lead in the first set, but regained control with some imperious serving to motor to an 86-minute victory. ‚ÄúIf we went through that match 10 times, I feel like I would win it more times than I would lose it,‚Äù Fritz said of their recent meeting in Dallas. ‚ÄúIn that match he served really well. Today, I probably returned a little bit better, but I got more help from him as well. He threw in some double [faults] and overall I played well.‚Äù Since the Australian Open, Fritz has dealt with an abdominal injury, which forced him to withdraw from the ATP 500 in Acapulco. Yet, with back-to-back fourth-round runs in Indian Wells and Miami, Fritz seems to be gathering welcome momentum. ¬† A 10-minute delay to assist a courtside fan in need of medical assistance appeared to shift the momentum with Shapovalov serving at 2-5. The Canadian No. 2 conjured some inspired shot-making to level at 5-5, but his hard work unravelled in a shaky 12th game: Shapovalov surrendered his serve to love with back-to-back double faults before Fritz hit a left-handed forehand en route to clinching his only set point. Fritz continued to pile on the pressure to Shapovalov, who won just 62 per cent (23/37) of his first-serve points. In contrast, Fritz was ruthless on serve throughout the second set, during which he did not drop a point behind his 17 first deliveries en route to improving to 5-6 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head with Shapovalov. As the first Top-3 seeded American in Miami since Andy Roddick in 2007, Fritz will next face Australia‚Äôs Adam Walton, who overcame Hong Kong‚Äôs Coleman Wong 7-6(6), 4-6, 6-4 to become the fourth lucky loser to reach the Miami fourth round in tournament history.
