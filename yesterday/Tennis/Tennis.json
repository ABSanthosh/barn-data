It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "When you step through the gates at the Internazionali BNL d’Italia, the atmosphere is unmistakable. Italian tennis is thriving — and you can feel it. The marble statues that line the Foro Italico may recall Rome’s ancient past, but the energy coursing through the venue is undeniably modern. It’s not just about loyal fans packing the stands, but about a homegrown tennis boom, and right now, it’s alive and well in the Italian capital. “We are Jannik’s girls,” one lady told ATPTour.com, wearing an iconic orange jersey with ‘Alo’ Jannik’ written on it. “We love him, he’s the best in the world, full stop. He’s also a good, simple guy.” Jannik Sinner fans in attendance at the Foro Italico in Rome.  The sense of connection was evident as Jannik Sinner returned to the capital for the first time since becoming the first Italian to reach No. 1 in the history of the PIF ATP Rankings. The 23-year-old was met with a chorus of ‘Olé, Olé, Olé, Sinner’ during his first practice session on Campo Centrale, and those chants have not ceased as he made his way through the draw. Yet the enthusiasm isn’t reserved just for one player. Having joined Sinner inside the Top 10, Lorenzo Musetti's rise marks another step forward for the country’s depth, becoming just the sixth Italian player to achieve that feat. The adoration for Musetti was evident on Wednesday night, when the Italian rode the backing of a lively crowd to an inspired performance over defending champion Alexander Zverev. With his win, Musetti became the first Italian player to reach the semi-finals at all three clay-court ATP Masters 1000 events in one season. “Full crowd, full stadium, that’s a big advantage,” said Musetti. “All week there has been incredible support from the fans. I felt the adrenaline and the energy from the first point.” Lorenzo Musetti defeats Alexander Zverev in Rome. Photo: Dan Istitene/Getty Images Four of the six Italians to have cracked the Top 10 in PIF ATP Rankings history featured in the 2025 main draw in Rome, with Matteo Berrettini and Fabio Fognini joining Sinner and Musetti. The 37-year-old Fognini, who is tied with Stan Wawrinka and Novak Djokovic for the most men’s singles appearances in Rome (18), bade farewell to the tournament this year. Fognini’s last dance in the capital added a layer of emotion to proceedings during the opening week. “I love them,” Fognini said of the Italian fans. “I would like to be remembered for [being] a guy who showed passion, sometimes too much passion, on the court. That’s the way I was, I was feeling my work, feeling the tennis, feeling it in my veins.” This year, the sense of occasion came with another unique twist. With the papal conclave taking place during the tournament’s opening week, fans on Campo Centrale looked up to see the announcement of Pope Leo XIV’s election broadcast live on the big screens.It was a moment that added to the already distinctive atmosphere: Part history, part tennis, part something only Rome could deliver. Fognini's passion has long been a part of Italy’s tennis culture and, as the next generation rises, it’s being carried forward by a younger group eager to make their own mark and leave an impression among the home fans. The 21-year-old Luca Nardi, who was one of three Italian wild cards to win a main-draw match this year, spoke of what the tournament means to him and the importance of the vibrant fans. “I was coming here when I was a kid to watch the tournament as a fan,” Nardi told ATPTour.com after edging Flavio Cobolli in a rowdy all-Italian clash on Grand Stand Arena. “Playing here in front of my home crowd is an amazing feeling. It’s always amazing, the crowd is super motivated and cheers a lot for us. Every year it’s special.” Sinner has held the World No. 1 spot for 48 consecutive weeks, amassing six tour-level titles and just three match losses during that period. It’s no surprise that the 23-year-old from San Candido’s success has lifted expectation, as well as trophies. “It’s a motivation not just for me, but for all Italians,” Nardi said when asked of Sinner’s progress. “I know Lorenzo [Musetti], Flavio [Cobolli] and everyone else very well, it’s a big motivation for all of us.” That belief is mirrored by investment. The Italian Tennis Federation has expanded its commitment to the Italian ATP Masters 1000 event with a renovated Foro Italico and the addition of a new 3,200-seat stadium: Super Tennis Arena. “Every big tournament is trying to build new things, but Rome is a little bit different,” said tournament director Paolo Lorenzi. “We have a lot of history, and this place is not only for tennis, it’s for other things. “We just built this court from nothing. We have all the statues around the court, I think it’s something really special. Also for the players, I like that they have this feeling of staying in a place in the middle of history.” A new era in Rome 🎾 🇮🇹 The Foro Italico underwent a major transformation ahead of this year’s ATP Masters 1000 event 🔨 The expanded venue now features three brand new courts built inside the iconic Stadio dei Marmi: The SuperTennis Arena, a new 3,000-seat stadium, plus two… pic.twitter.com/usMFvMseNv — ATP Tour (@atptour) May 9, 2025 There are seven Italian men currently inside the Top 50, and Hologic WTA World No. 5 Jasmine Paolini emphasises the strength in depth across the board. Lorenzi, the former World No. 33, recognises the impact that this new wave of Italian stars is having — not just on the court, but how the country is perceived within the sport. Their professionalism and character, he says, are playing a key role in Italy’s growing reputation. “You have Sinner, Musetti, [Jasmine] Paolini, Berrettini… All of them have a good image,” Lorenzi said. “If you watch them, they are people that are working for tennis. At this moment, we are not only one of the best countries in the world for tennis, but also the image they give us is really important.” With every chant, cheer, and rising star, Rome reminds us this is more than a tournament — it's a celebration of Italy's tennis renaissance.  [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Novak Djokovic could have a chance at instant revenge against Matteo Arnaldi at the Gonet Geneva Open. The Serbian, seeded second, was put on a collision course with his Madrid conqueror with the reveal of the draw at the clay-court ATP 250. Djokovic will face the winner of Marton Fucsovics and Zizou Bergs in his opening match, and is seeded to meet Arnaldi in the quarter-finals. The eighth-seeded Italian will play Hugo Gaston in the first round and either Fabian Marozsan or a qualifier in the second round. A Djokovic-Arnaldi rematch would be just their second Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting after Arnaldi's 6-3, 6-4 win last month in what was Djokovic's opener at the Madrid ATP Masters 1000. Following that defeat, the Serbian carries a three-match losing streak into Geneva, with opening-round exits in four of his past five events. He did not compete in Rome. Should Djokovic return to winning ways, he is seeded to meet third seed Tomas Machac in the Geneva semi-finals for the second straight year. The Czech prevailed in last year's semis, but Djokovic improved to 2-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head with a win at this season's Australian Open. View the Geneva singles draw Geneva top seed Taylor Fritz will face Jaume Munar or Quentin Halys in his opening match, with sixth seed Hubert Hurkacz and fourth seed Karen Khachanov potential opponents beyond that. After reaching the last 16 in Madrid, Fritz was knocked out by fellow American Marcos Giron in his Rome opener. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
