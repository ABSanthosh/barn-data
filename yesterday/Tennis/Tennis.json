Let‚Äôs take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Casper Ruud quickly dismissed the disappointment of his early Australian Open exit with a Davis Cup win on home soil in Oslo on Thursday. The 26-year-old Norwegian, who lost to #NextGenATP star Jakub Mensik in the second round in Melbourne, ousted Argentine Mariano Navone 6-3, 6-3 in the Davis Cup Qualifiers first round, levelling the tie 1-1 after Tomas Martin Etcheverry gave Argentina an early lead with a win over Nicolai Budkov Kjaer. Ruud displayed clinical form on his way to securing his 28th Davis Cup match win. He won 71 per cent (35/49) of first-serve points and saved six of seven break points he faced in the 70-minute encounter. [ATP APP] Earlier, Etcheverry escaped Norway‚Äôs 18-year-old Budkov Kjaer 7-5, 2-6, 7-6(5) after a three-hour, 49-minute battle. In disbelief after the hard-fought victory, the 25-year-old Etcheverry fell on his back and covered his eyes. Etcheverry trailed 2-4 in the final set, but refused to go down. Budkov Kjaer, the 2024 Wimbledon boys‚Äô singles champion, suffered with cramps as the match progressed. Etcheverry seized control in lengthy baseline exchanges and eventually secured his fourth Davis Cup match win.[NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Fifth seed Tallon Griekspoor continued his indoor prowess Thursday at the Open Occitanie in Montpellier, where he spoiled home favourite Richard Gasquet's final appearance at the ATP 250 with a 6-3, 3-6, 7-5 victory against the three-time champion. Boasting 25 indoor wins since the start of the 2023 season, Griekspoor trails only the No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Jannik Sinner (33), for most on the ATP Tour. The 28-year-old Griekspoor was tested for two hours and three minutes by former No. 7 Gasquet, 10 years his senior. Griekspoor fought off six break points in the deciding set, including four at 4-4 that would have allowed Gasquet to serve for the match had he converted. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how I got away with that,‚Äù Griekspoor said in his on-court interview. ‚ÄúI guess I was a little bit lucky there. A lot of second serves there as well, just a little bit lucky there. It went my way. Happy with the win in the end and happy to get another chance to come back tomorrow.‚Äù [ATP APP] Into the quarter-finals, the Dutchman will next meet countryman Jesper de Jong, who upset third seed Flavio Cobolli 6-3, 7-6(2). Prior to this week, there had not been a Dutchman to reach the quarter-finals in the previous 14 editions of the Montpellier ATP 250. Gasquet, who made six consecutive Montpellier finals from 2013-18, is set to retire at this year‚Äôs Roland Garros. He was making a record 13th appearance in Montpellier, where he owns a tournament-record 29 match wins. Griekspoor praised the tour-veteran during his on-court interview and the home favourite was honoured with a presentation following the match. ‚ÄúFirst of all, big applause for Richard,‚Äù Griekspoor said. ‚ÄúUnbelievable career, achieved so much. If I can achieve a little bit of what he‚Äôs achieved in his career, I‚Äôd absolutely sign for it.‚ÄùMerci Richard ü•π The 3‚É£-time champion bids farewell to the Montpellier crowd in his final appearance ‚ù§Ô∏è@richardgasquet1 | @OpenOccitanie | #openoccitanie pic.twitter.com/HmwXpgVIXe‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) January 30, 2025 Earlier, American qualifier Aleksandar Kovacevic reached the last eight after he ousted Italian Mattia Bellucci 7-5, 7-6(5). Up next for the 26-year-old is defending champion Alexander Bublik, who also won the title in 2022.Nikoloz Basilashvili defeated seventh seed Arthur Rinderknech 6-0, 7-6(4) to reach his first tour-level quarter-final since 2022 Munich. World No. 178 Basilashvili, who has been as high as No. 16, is the lowest-ranked Montpellier quarter-finalist since No. 210 Tsonga in 2019. The 32-year-old next faces top seed Andrey Rublev.
