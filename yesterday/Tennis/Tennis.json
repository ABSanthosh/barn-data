    "description": "Four players are vying for the two remaining semi-final spots at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Luca Van Assche and Nishesh Basavareddy will clash on Friday to determine who finishes second in Red Group while Arthur Fils and Learner Tien aim to advance out of Blue Group. Second seed Alex Michelsen, safely in the last four, will kickstart Day 3 action against China‚Äôs Shang Juncheng. Like Michelsen, eighth seed Joao Fonseca is into the semi-finals with a perfect record. The Brazilian faces Jakub Mensik in the evening session. What are the semi-final scenarios? Click here to find out. [ATP APP] [6] Luca Van Assche (FRA) vs [7] Nishesh Basavareddy (USA) Van Assche and Basavareddy have both split their opening two matches and now will go toe to toe with high stakes: win or go home. Van Assche, one of three players in the field competing in Jeddah for the second consecutive year, has hopes of improving upon his 2023 semi-final showing. Basavareddy is fresh off the highest-ranked win of his career against World No. 50 Shang. The American Basavareddy enjoyed a superb ATP Challenger Tour season, claiming 41 match wins and two titles at that level. With both Van Assche and Basavareddy possessing all-court traits, their first meeting could be a battle of who can jump ahead first and ride momentum in the first-to-four, best-of-five set format featured in Jeddah. [1] Arthur Fils (FRA) vs [5] Learner Tien (USA) Top seed Fils and American Tien face a must-win scenario at the 20-and-under event. Fils, a finalist last year in Jeddah, bounced back quickly from his difficult start to improve to 1-1 in Blue Group. The 20-year-old has played some of his best tennis under pressure this season, securing ATP 500 titles in Hamburg and Tokyo. The ultra-consistent Tien went 35-9 on the ATP Challenger Tour this season with three title runs. The California native started this week on a high note, downing third seed Mensik, but suffered a four-set defeat to Fonseca on Thursday. Tien will next look to avenge his US Open loss to Fils, who earned a 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 first-round win against the lefty at Flushing Meadows less than four months ago. Fils created 19 break chances and converted seven of them, according to Infosys ATP Stats, emphasising Tien's importance of holding serve in Friday's high-stakes rematch. Fils, World No. 20, is the highest-ranked player in this year's field. Credit: Peter Staples/ATP Tour [2] Alex Michelsen (USA) vs [4] Shang Juncheng (CHN) The American Michelsen appears transformed from last year, when he went 0-3 in round-robin play in Jeddah. With a semi-final berth already secured, the 20-year-old hopes to maintain his perfect record in his first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Shang. They met twice on the ATP Challenger Tour spanning from 2022-23, with Michelsen winning both matches. While Shang is the first player to represent China in the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, Michelsen is one of three Americans competing this year alone. Shang, No. 50 in the PIF ATP Rankings, became just the second Chinese player to triumph on the ATP Tour with his title in Chengdu in September. Michelsen reached two tour-level finals this year: Newport and Winston-Salem. ROARING into the semis ü¶Å#NextGenATPFinals pic.twitter.com/odjjZChh3u ‚Äî Next Gen ATP Finals (@nextgenfinals) December 19, 2024 [3] Jakub Mensik (CZE) vs [8] Joao Fonseca (BRA) Adding your name to the record books amidst elite company such as Jannik Sinner is a difficult task. Yet that is what 18-year-old Joao Fonseca has done in Jeddah, becoming the second-youngest semi-finalist in event history, only one month younger than 2019 champion Sinner. But the Brazilian will first be focussed on the task at hand as World No. 48 Mensik comes hungry, searching for his first win this week. Mensik, the ATP Newcomer of the Year, broke into the Top 50 of the PIF ATP Rankings in the final month of the season. The Czech cemented his status as one of the Tour‚Äôs brightest prospects with standout results across the year. Mensik reached the Doha final in February and later made the third round of the US Open. In October, Mensik was a quarter-finalist in Shanghai, where he upset two Top 10 opponents, and Vienna. ORDER OF PLAY - FRIDAY, DECEMBER 20, 2024 CENTRE COURT start 2:00 pm [2] Alex Michelsen (USA) vs [4] Shang Juncheng (CHN) Not Before 3:00 pm [6] Luca Van Assche (FRA) vs [7] Nishesh Basavareddy (USA) Not Before 7:00 pm [1] Arthur Fils (FRA) vs [5] Learner Tien (USA) [3] Jakub Mensik (CZE) vs [8] Joao Fonseca (BRA) [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Fans are arriving from near and far in Jeddah for the 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. The 20-and-under event has already produced plenty of memorable moments on the court this week, with sublime shotmaking, group-stage upsets and plenty of unique moments thanks to the innovative set of rules in play. While some of those enjoying the action from the stands are seasoned tennis fans, the tournament has also attracted newcomers to the sport. ‚ÄúIt is fun here; I like the weather and the fan zone,‚Äù Omar Binsawad from Jeddah, who was attending Thursday‚Äôs evening session (featuring top seed Arthur Fils) with his nine-year-old son, told ATPTour.com. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really excited to experience tennis for the first time, and to bring my son to see a sport other than football. I want him to see other opportunities in other sports. It looks lovely here. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not that big a fan of tennis. I play padel, which is a little bit different, but it‚Äôs great that tennis activities are here in Jeddah now, so it‚Äôs an opportunity for us, and an opportunity for my son to see other sports. I think he might like it.‚Äù Fans play minitennis on Thursday in Jeddah. Photo Credit: Saudi Tennis Federation During breaks in play, ticketholders have been heading to the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF fan zone to grab a bite to eat, play minitennis, or enjoy a musical extravaganza featuring DJs and dancers. They also have the chance to meet some of the ATP Tour stars competing in Jeddah: On Thursday, Alex Michelsen signed autographs for fans after he sealed his semi-final spot with victory against Luca Van Assche. Fans watch a DJ perform on Thursday in the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF fan zone. Photo Credit: Saudi Tennis Federation Among those in the fan zone on Thursday evening were seven friends from Manila ‚Äî Alfie, Billy, Bogs, Dima, Fahar, Joe and Mike ‚Äî all of whom are members of Tennis Club Makkah in the Filipino capital. Although they are all passionate about playing the sport, watching elite-level tennis in Jeddah was a novel experience for some members of the party. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the first time ever I watched tennis live,‚Äù said Alfie. ‚Äú[Roger] Federer is my favourite player ever, but here my favourite is Shang Juncheng. The fan zone is cool. I like it here.‚Äù Members of Tennis Club Makkah in Manila, the Philippines, pose for a photo at the Jeddah fan zone. Photo Credit: Andy West/ATP Tour As well as Shang, Alfie is also a huge fan of another left-hander: Rafael Nadal. He did not hesitate when asked which of the Spaniard‚Äôs attributes he most admired. ‚ÄúFederer and Nadal, ‚ÄòFedal‚Äô, are my favourite players. Nadal was so fearless. The way he played was so full of energy and full of power. With all his technique and energy, he was amazing,‚Äù said Alfie, although he also acknowledged he had a unique personal reason to being drawn to lefties such as the Spaniard and Chinese #NextGenATP star Shang. ‚ÄúI like left-handers, because my weakness [when I play] is playing left-handers!‚Äù Billy, who was recently elected as the club president of Tennis Club Makkah, added: ‚ÄúThis is the second time members of the club have come to Jeddah. We were here for the Next Gen finals last year. We are all from the Philippines and love to play tennis. Now we are here. The stadium is amazing, and the weather is great.‚Äù [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
