    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/sinner-federer-straight-set-defeats-2024",
    "description": "Italian Jannik Sinner enjoyed a historic season in which he rose to World No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings and collected eight tour-level trophies, including his first two major titles. Across 79 matches this year, spanning countless kilometres, surface changes, and elite competition, Sinner also achieved a feat previously accomplished only by Swiss legend Roger Federer. The 23-year-old never lost in straight sets. Sinner and Federer are the only players in the Open Era to achieve this feat (minimum 20 matches played). Sinner finished his standout year with a 73-6 win-loss record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. “My goal was to understand what I can achieve this year,” Sinner said after winning the Nitto ATP Finals, his eighth title of the year. “There was no specific goal of winning a Grand Slam or being No. 1 or whatever. It’s going to be the same next year: Whatever we can catch, we take, and the rest we learn. “I think that was the mentality we approached this whole year [with] trying to raise my level in specific moments, which I’ve done throughout this year.” Comparing Sinner's 2024 season versus Federer's 2005 season Stat Sinner (2024) Federer (2005) W-L 73-6 81-4 Win % 92% 95% Titles 8 11 Record v. Top 10 18-5 15-2 Straight-sets losses 0 0   A dive into the results shows how difficult it is to dethrone the man atop the PIF ATP Rankings. Five of Sinner’s six losses came to Top 10 opponents. His lowest-ranked loss was to then-World No. 12 Stefanos Tsitsipas in Monte-Carlo, where the Greek went on to capture the title. Sinner’s great rival Carlos Alcaraz was a perfect 3-0 against the Italian this year, accounting for half of the six losses. When Alcaraz defeated Sinner, he eventually lifted the trophy, triumphing in Indian Wells, at Roland Garros and Beijing (where they met in the final). Alcaraz and Tsitsipas’ victories mean that four of Sinner’s six losses came to the eventual champion. How does this compare to Federer’s 2005 season? The Swiss went 81-4 that year and three of his losses came to the eventual champion at best-of-five tournaments. Federer also won two major titles in 2005 to bring his Slam tally to six. Sinner has already solidified his place in the record books and if this season is an indication, he is setting the stage for an even brighter future. [ATP APP] “Going into my offseason, starting next year, I feel like I have a good idea of what things I need to improve on, but I also feel like I'm playing very good tennis,” Sinner said. “Back when I was 5 [in the world], I didn't feel like I was 5. Now I'm ranked where I'm at, I feel like I belong. It's a different feeling. It's been a great year. That gives me a lot of confidence to have that belief. That's a huge part of having the big results.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/best-of-2024-rivalries-zverev-fritz",
    "description": "To mark the end of another thrilling season, ATPTour.com is unveiling our annual 'Best Of' series, which will reflect on the most intriguing rivalries, matches, comebacks, upsets and more. This week, we are looking at the best rivalries of the year.  Taylor Fritz appears to have mastered his rivalry with Alexander Zverev in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series this year. The American, who finished the year at a career high of No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings, strung together four consecutive wins over Zverev across the back half of the season. After a resounding defeat to the German in the quarter-finals in Rome, Fritz locked in to showcase the evolution of their rivalry, marked by stunning comebacks, pivotal moments, and relentless competition. [ATP APP] Rome QFs, Zverev d. Fritz 6-4, 6-3 Two of the qualities that have proven pivotal in Zverev’s ascent to No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings have been his trusty backhand and vastly improved serve. In his Rome quarter-final clash with Fritz, however, it was his forehand that made the headlines. After falling to the court in the third game, which drew audible gasps from the crowd, Zverev steadied himself to secure a commanding victory. The German produced an expertly measured performance to limit Fritz’s ability to attack from his favoured wing. Instead, Zverev unleashed 20 winners himself and faced no break points throughout the match, according to Infosys ATP Stats. “That’s the shot I either win or lose matches with. That’s how it’s been my entire career,” Zverev said of his forehand. “When I’m hitting that shot well, that’s when I win.” Zverev would go on to sweep the field in Rome to clinch his first ATP Masters 1000 trophy since the Cincinnati Open in 2021 and pull to a 5-3 lead in his Lexus ATP Head2Head with Fritz.   Wimbledon R16, Fritz d. Zverev 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 6-3 Leading two sets to love against Fritz in their Wimbledon clash, it seemed as if Zverev reignted his momentum from their meeting in Rome. However, if there was a textbook example of a ‘momentum shift’, it came with Zverev’s double fault at 4-4 in the third set. It marked the first time his serve had been broken in the tournament and it also ignited a heroic comeback from Fritz, who clawed back and sealed victory from a two-set deficit for the third time in his career. Not only this, but it proved to be a significant juncture in their Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry, which turned a sharp corner. “I thought it would really suck to be playing this well and to lose in three straight [sets],\" said Fritz, who improved to eight consecutive wins, including the title in Eastbourne. “I had the belief. I thought I was playing really good tennis.” US Open QFs, Fritz d. Zverev 7-6(2), 3-6, 6-4, 7-6(3) If Fritz was going to reach semi-finals at a major for the first time, having failed in each of the previous four occasions, he was going to have to do it in style. Facing former US Open finalist Zverev, however, Fritz did just that. With his skillful baseline consistently and tactful approach to the encounter, Fritz sealed a three-hour, 26-minute victory. In a fortnight of breaking new ground, Fritz then went on to defeat countryman Frances Tiafoe in a five-set epic to become the first American man to reach the final of a Grand Slam tournament since Andy Roddick in 2009. “I feel amazing,” Fritz said after his triumph against Zverev. “I’ve had a lot of looks at quarter-finals in the past couple of years, and today just felt different. I really feel that it was my time to take a step further and it’s only fitting I’m doing it here on this court at the [US] Open in front of this crowd.” Taylor Fritz in action at the 2024 US Open. (Photo Credit: Sarah Stier/Getty Images) Laver Cup RR, Fritz d. Zverev 6-4, 7-5 By the time of their next meeting later in September, Fritz had won four of his previous five hard-court matches against Zverev, and the momentum he was now carrying in their Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry showed no signs of slowing down. Although Fritz prevailed in straight sets, the match was yet another grueling example of their fiercely contested baseline battles. Claiming his seventh victory over a Top 10 opponent in 2024, Fritz further solidified his reputation as one of the season’s most improved players. Down 2-4 in the second set, Fritz drew on his steady game to wear down Zverev, reeling off five of the last six games to notch his third straight win over the German. “I think [our] games match up well,” said Fritz, who moved ahead (6-5) in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series for the first time. “I can serve and hang in there with my serve, because he's very tough to break. You have to have a good serve to stay in the match with him or else he's just going to serve you out of the match.”     Nitto ATP Finals SFs, Fritz d. Zverev 6-3, 3-6, 7-6(3) Fritz closed his dominant year against Zverev by snapping the Rolex Paris Masters champion’s eight-match winning streak in the semi-finals in Turin. After a near-flawless opening set from Fritz, during which he won 18 out of 19 first-serve points, Zverev eased into the encounter to force a deciding set. As had become a pattern in 2024, Fritz held his nerve in the demanding baseline exchanges, saving five all five break points faced in the third set to claim victory in a tie-break. The two-hour, 21-minute triumph was Fritz's fourth consecutive over Zverev in their intriguing rivalry.  “I felt like I played an almost perfect first set, but things can change so quickly when you're playing someone like Sascha,\" Fritz said. \"I found myself in some tough spots in the third, when we both started to get on each other's serves even more.”   [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
