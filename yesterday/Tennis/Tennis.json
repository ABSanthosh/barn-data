It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Andrey Rublev is up and running in 2025. The No. 10 in the PIF ATP Rankings earned his first win of the season on Wednesday at the Open Occitanie in Montpellier, where he overcame American Christopher Eubanks 6-4, 6-3 to reach the quarter-finals. Rublev suffered opening-round exits against Fabian Marozsan and #NextGenATP Brazilian Joao Fonseca in Hong Kong and at the Australian Open, respectively. However, the top seed was in control throughout his 66-minute clash against Eubanks at the ATP 250 indoor hard event in France, where he won 89 per cent (25/28) of his first-serve points, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Rublev leads Eubanks 2-0 in the pair’s Lexus ATP Head2Head series and will next play Arthur Rinderknech or Nikoloz Basilashvili in the quarter-finals. Felix Auger-Aliassime continued his good start to the season by overcoming Frenchman Arthur Cazaux 6-4, 7-6(5). The second seed lifted the trophy at the ATP 250 hard-court event in Adelaide earlier this month and is now in the quarter-finals in Montpellier for the second time. The Canadian, a semi-finalist in Montpellier last year, will next play China’s Buyunchaokete. The eighth seed defeated Constant Lestienne 6-2, 6-1. Defending champion Alexander Bublik began his title defence in France with a 6-4, 6-2 win against Dominik Koepfer. The fourth seed captured his fourth tour-level title at the ATP 250 last year. Bublik arrived in Montpellier holding a 0-2 record on 2025. In first-round action on Day 3, American qualifier Aleksandar Kovacevic moved past sixth seed David Goffin 6-2, 3-6, 6-4, while Dutchman Jesper de Jong advanced after French wild card Quentin Halys was forced to retire. De Jong, 24, led 7-6(7), 2-0 when play was stopped. De Jong will meet Flavio Cobolli in the second round. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/antwerp-brussels-relocation-2025",
    "description": "The European Open, Belgium’s largest tennis tournament, is moving to Brussels after nine editions in Antwerp, the tournament announced Wednesday. From 12-19 October, the tournament will take place at the ING Arena, the former Palais 12 at Brussels Expo. “This new location allows us to take the tournament to the next level, both for players and fans,” Tournament Director Dick Norman said. The new arena’s central location makes it easy to access for visitors from both Belgium and abroad. Brussels Expo also provides more space, which will enhance the experience and comfort for all fans. “Brussels offers the ideal setting to help the tournament grow into a top-tier event, giving tennis lovers an unforgettable experience,” Norman added. In 2017, Palais 12 hosted a memorable Davis Cup match between Belgium and Australia. Steve Darcis delivered a decisive victory, creating a wave of excitement. That atmosphere is set to return this year, with fans expecting another incredible experience. The move to Brussels comes at the same time as a celebration of a decade of the European Open, the only ATP 250 tournament in Belgium. Geoffroy Bourbon, ATP Executive Vice President, Europe, said: \"We are excited to see the European Open enter its next chapter in Brussels. A strong foundation has been built over the years, and we are grateful to the organization for its dedication to tennis and the ATP Tour. The move to the ING Arena presents a fantastic opportunity to elevate the experience for players and fans, and we look forward to seeing the event thrive in its new home in the Belgian capital.\" [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
