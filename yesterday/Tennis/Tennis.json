    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/sinner-wimbledon-2025-preview",
    "description": "Jannik Sinner has cemented his status as one of the dominant forces on the ATP Tour over the past year, but as he returns to Wimbledon, there‚Äôs still unfinished business. The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has had time to reflect on his gut-wrenching defeat to Carlos Alcaraz at Roland Garros, where he let slip three consecutive championship points. Now, his focus shifts to another challenge: the tricky transition from clay to grass. When asked about the biggest hurdle in adapting to grass-court tennis, Sinner was direct in his response. ‚ÄúMovement, for sure, because the movement is the most important part for us tennis players,‚Äù Sinner said in Saturday‚Äôs pre-tournament press conference. ‚ÄúIf someone moves well, it means that he is a good player. That's how I see tennis from outside. ‚ÄúYou have to cover the spots more, improvise a little bit more on the other sides. It's a very different game style we see on grass.‚Äù Despite the difficulties of switching surfaces, Sinner has already shown he‚Äôs capable of adjusting. Last season, just two weeks after falling in the Roland Garros semi-finals, the Italian lifted his first grass-court trophy in Halle. However, his title defence at the German ATP 500 didn‚Äôt go as planned this year, with Sinner bowing out in the second round to Alexander Bublik. That loss, coupled with his defeat to rival Alcaraz, who now leads Sinner 8-4 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, might raise doubts over his momentum heading into Wimbledon. But the top seed is unfazed. ‚ÄúHonestly, I feel ready to play. We are practising very well,‚Äù said Sinner. ‚ÄúWhat happened in the past is in the past already. I feel good. I feel especially mentally I feel in a very good spot. Halle was a little bit different, because before I haven't had so much time to cut that off. Now it's gone, and I also see the reactions of other players and people. They [said] the level is very, very high. Just privileged to be in this position. ‚ÄúWe are working very hard. I feel like I'm playing great, great tennis on grass. Hopefully I can show this also in the match court. I'm just looking forward to going on court and to compete and enjoy the time.‚Äù Sinner has plenty of positive memories at the All England Club. While Wimbledon remains the only major where he‚Äôs yet to reach the final, he‚Äôs enjoyed deep runs ‚Äî reaching the semi-finals in 2023, losing to Novak Djokovic, and making the quarter-finals in 2022 and 2024. ‚ÄúIt feels good again after one year coming back here,‚Äù said Sinner, who faces countryman Luca Nardi in his opener. ‚ÄúI'm very happy. I have some good feelings coming here, even though it's a bit different than last year, coming with the win in Halle. ‚ÄúBut it's good. I had some time off before coming here. We are practicing very well. The days are long. So I feel ready to compete again.‚Äù [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "In a year already filled with breakthrough moments, Joao Fonseca will check off another milestone at Wimbledon, where he will make his debut. Ahead of his first-round match, the 18-year-old Brazilian fine-tuned his grass-court game in a high-intensity practice session with two-time defending Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz. Alcaraz and Fonseca warmed up on the lawns of Aorangi Park by rallying crosscourt before they shifted gears into a full practise set, which Alcaraz narrowly won 7-5. The Spaniard was full of praise for Fonseca's game following the session and shared why he believes the Brazilian has the ability to excel on grass. \"I was excited about hitting with him, since the last time that I hit with him [was] in 2023 [at the Nitto ATP Finals],\" Alcaraz said. \"I have been excited to hit with him since he [arrived] on the ATP. He's quite new on grass. I've been talking with him. He's not really an experienced player on grass. But his style, he loves to play aggressively, to hit big forehands, go to the net. So I'm pretty sure he's going to get the level on grass really, really soon. \"Right now, [there are] a few things that he has to learn because he's so young and he is just starting to play the new tournaments. But his level is pretty high so far.\" Carlos doing Carlos things üòè#Wimbledon | @carlosalcaraz pic.twitter.com/EsIaG9XCrk ‚Äî Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) June 28, 2025 Earlier this week, Fonseca notched his first tour-level grass-court victory at the ATP 250 event in Eastbourne. The 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion will face Jacob Fearnley in the first round at the All England Club. Alcaraz, fresh of his Queen's Club title, will try to become just the second man in the Open Era, alongside Bjorn Borg, to complete the Roland Garros-Wimbledon double in consecutive years. The Spaniard is also aiming to become just the fifth player in the Open Era to win three consecutive Wimbledon titles. \"I really want to win the title. I really want to lift the trophy,\" Alcaraz said. \"[I'm] not thinking about how many players have done it, winning three Wimbledons in a row. I just want to be ready and just want to prepare myself in the best way possible, just to start the tournament with a lot of confidence. I feel a lot of confidence right now.\" Alcaraz will open Centre Court play on Monday against Fabio Fognini. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
