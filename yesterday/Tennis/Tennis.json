It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/sinner-australian-open-2025-title-no-1-club",
    "description": "To say Jannik Sinner is enjoying a successful first stint at No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings would be a massive understatement. Since climbing to the top of men's tennis on 10 June last year, the Italian has been nearly perfect. According to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, Sinner's winning percentage as World No. 1 has been better than all 28 previous No. 1s in the history of the PIF ATP Rankings (since 1973). Winning % As World No. 1 (Top Five)  Players  Record As No. 1  Winning %  1) Jannik Sinner  47-3  94%  2) Bjorn Borg  136-12  91.9%  3) Jimmy Connors  408-45  90.1%  4) Ivan Lendl  362-44  89.2%  5) Roger Federer  430-56  88.5%  6) John McEnroe  226-34  86.9% Sinner has tallied a 47-3 record since securing top spot, giving him a winning percentage of 94 per cent. The sample size is small compared to others on the leaderboard, but he is certainly off to a hot start. The 23-year-old has won titles at six of his nine tournaments: Halle, Cincinnati, the US Open, Shanghai, the Nitto ATP Finals and the Australian Open. Only three players have won at least 90 per cent of their matches while World No. 1: Sinner, Bjorn Borg (91.9%) and Jimmy Connors (90.1%). Not only has Sinner won an overwhelming percentage of his matches, but his three defeats have all gone to a deciding set. The lowest-ranked player he has lost to since becoming World No. 1 was then-No. 8 and eventual champion Andrey Rublev last year in Toronto. The Italian has not lost a match in straight sets since the championship match of the 2023 Nitto ATP Finals against Novak Djokovic. That loss came seven months before he climbed to World No. 1. Sinner's winning percentage as No. 1 is well ahead of the three other active players who are part of the ATP No. 1 Club: Djokovic (86.1%), Carlos Alcaraz (78.6%) and Daniil Medvedev (72.7%). It is important to note that Djokovic has played 513 more matches as World No. 1, but Sinner is off to a dream start. The pressure of being the player the rest of the ATP Tour is chasing has not stalled his growth. Sinner has won a significantly higher percentage of his matches as No. 1 (94%) than he did before reaching the top (74.3%). The San Candido native, who is up to 34 weeks as No. 1, is trying to become just the fifth player in history to extend his first stint to more than a year. Those who have previously accomplished the feat are Roger Federer (237 weeks), Connors (160 weeks), Lleyton Hewitt (75 weeks) and Djokovic (53 weeks). Sinner currently leads World No. 2 Alexander Zverev by 3,695 points. He is next scheduled to compete at the Qatar ExxonMobil Open in Doha, where the action begins on 17 February.

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/griekspoor-bvdz-montpellier-2025-tuesday",
    "description": "Tallon Griekspoor settled back in quickly to indoor conditions on Tuesday at the Open Occitanie in Montpellier. The Dutchman overcame countryman Botic van de Zandschulp 7-5, 6-3 in a topsy-turvy 95-minute battle. Now with 24 indoor wins since the start of the 2023 season, Griekspoor trails only the No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Jannik Sinner (33) for most on the ATP Tour. “I’ve always played well here, felt well… I like the conditions,” said Griekspoor. “I like a roof above my head, the same as Rotterdam next week. It’s perfect for me to be here, first win of the season, a great day so far. “It’s very not easy to play each other, we practise together every day when we’re back home in Amsterdam. We know each other better than anyone else I guess, so that also makes it very tricky. I don’t think we played our best match, but that’s what happens when you know each other so well.” Griekspoor squandered a break lead in both sets, but made amends with his clinical performance at the net. The fifth seed won 18 of 24 points when at the forecourt, according to Infosys ATP Stats, en route to improving to 2-1 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Van de Zandschulp. Awaiting the Dutchman in the second round is three-time champion Richard Gasquet, who prevailed 6-3, 6-2 in an all-French clash with Adrian Mannarino. It was a record-extending 29th main-draw win in Montpellier for Gasquet, who has announced he will retire after Roland Garros this year. “It’s always special to play against a friend. We are used to it. I’ve played many times against a French player,\" said Gasquet after his 76-minute victory. \"It’s a little bit different, and my last time here in Montpellier so of course I’m really happy to win. \"I hope Adrian will win in the future, but I’m really happy with how I played. It’s really important for me to play another match. I really like to play here, I won many times, so I’m really happy to play here again.” In other action in Montpellier, Christopher Eubanks battled past qualifier Alibek Kachmazov 7-5 6-4 to set up a meeting with top seed Andrey Rublev. Frenchman Constant Lestienne rallied back from 2-5 in the second set to defeat Borna Coric 6-3, 7-5, and Mattia Bellucci defeated 2018 champion Lucas Pouille 6-4, 6-4. In an all-French matchup, seventh seed Arthur Rinderknech eliminated Harold Mayot 7-6(2), 2-6, 6-1 in two hours and 10 minutes. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
