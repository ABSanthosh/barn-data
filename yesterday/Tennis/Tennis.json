    "description": "The wide slice serve is a CRITICAL tool to have in your tool box. It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Hubert Hurkacz continued his short and long-term redemption at the United Cup in Sydney Saturday, dismissing Alexander Shevchenko 6-3, 6-2 to take Poland to the cusp of its second consecutive final. After losing both his singles matches in group play to Casper Ruud and Tomas Machac, Hurkacz backed up his quarter-final win over Billy Harris with a 58-minute victory over the Kazakhstani to set things up for World No. 2 teammate Iga Swiatek, who now plays former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina. Hurkacz last year held two championship points in the tournament final against Alexander Zverev only to see the current World No. 2 rally to a comeback win and then team with Laura Siegemund to beat him and Swiatek in the deciding mixed doubles. “The last match here gave me a little bit of confidence and I’ve been playing better with every single match,” Hurkacz said. [ATP APP] After struggling against the weight of shot in his defeats to Ruud and Machac, World No. 16 Hurkacz was the one to dictate from the baseline against Shevchenko. He was also dominated on serve, putting 76 per cent of his first deliveries into play, winning 80 per cent of first-serve points and 73 per cent of second-serve points.   Shevchenko played his best tennis early in the second set when he had more success moving Hurkacz out of the centre of the court, but after missing a 30-all opportunity in the fourth game, he made three unforced errors to get broken to love in the following game and never recovered. Hurkacz now leads Shevchenko 4-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.   [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
