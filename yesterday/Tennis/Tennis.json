Let‚Äôs take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Matteo Berrettini and Jannik Sinner kept alive Italy‚Äôs hopes of defending its Davis Cup title on Thursday, when they sealed the Final 8 tie against Argentina with a deciding doubles victory. The Italians dropped the opening singles match, but fittingly, it was the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings who was heroic, beginning with a 6-2, 6-1 win against Sebastian Baez. Sinner returned to court, teaming Berrettini to down Maximo Gonzalez and Andres Molteni 6-4, 7-5.Next stop üîú semi-finals üáÆüáπ Sinner/Berrettini seal the deal for Italy üôå@DavisCup | #DavisCup | @federtennis pic.twitter.com/I1le0tn6rb‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) November 21, 2024 Berrettini and Sinner won 90 per cent of their first-serve points and fended off all five break points they faced. They earned a key break at 5-5 in the second set, creating a buzz amongst Italian fans in Malaga as the fan favourites closed in on victory. Italy will next face Australia in the Davis Cup semi-finals, a rematch of last year‚Äôs championship. The 23-year-old Sinner arrived in Spain fresh off claiming the Nitto ATP Finals trophy and has carried his momentum forward. In his singles rubber against Baez, Sinner did not face a break point until 4-0 in the second set, erasing all four of the Argentine's chances that game to maintain a double-break lead. \"It was a must-win match,\" said Sinner, who holds a 71-6 season record and has won 27 of his past 28 matches. \"Very different conditions. The court is very, very fast and tough to play. I haven't had so much time to adapt to the conditions, but I'm happy about today.\"[ATP AWARDS] Earlier, Argentine Francisco Cerundolo downed Olympic bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti 6-4, 6-1 in the opening rubber. Cerundolo seamlessly transitioned from defence to offence and pinned Musetti deep beyond the baseline en route to a 90-minute victory. ‚ÄúI played one of the best matches of the year for sure,‚Äù said Cerundolo. The 26-year-old, who beat Musetti in the Umag final earlier this year, converted six of his 13 break point chances, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Did You Know? In 2023, Sinner clinched Italy's first Davis Cup title since 1976 with a victory against Australia's Alex de Minaur. Sinner, an 18-time tour-level titlist, saved three match points against Novak Djokovic to send Italy to the championship round. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "\"How old are you?\" \"17.\" \"What are you playing in at the moment?\" \"Junior tournaments, I was planning to be in the USA this week.\" \"What about next year?\" \"I‚Äôd like to get a good result at the Junior Grand Slams, to improve as a player and make the jump to real tennis, with adults.\" \"Stick at it, it‚Äôs a long road, but the most important thing is that you enjoy it.\" The words of advice came from Rafael Nadal, he was talking to Andres Santamarta. The 17-year-old enjoyed the experience of a lifetime this week at the Davis Cup Finals, where he had the privilege of forming part of the Spanish team as a sparring partner. Photo Credit: Andres Santamarta During the days leading up to the competition, he practised with the 22-time Grand Slam champion. ‚ÄúTo me Rafa is a role model. I‚Äôve watched him for so many years, at the top for as long as I can remember. I‚Äôm very lucky and I hope I can learn something from him and apply it to my tennis, to my game,‚Äù he told ATPTour.com. For Santamarta, the current No. 1308 in the PIF ATP Rankings, it was a masterclass. As well as sharing a locker room with Nadal at his farewell tournament, he did the same with the very player who is destined to continue his legacy, Carlos Alcaraz, along with Roberto Bautista Agut, Marcel Granollers and Pedro Mart√≠nez. ‚ÄúI feel very lucky to have been able to share this moment with those five and with the whole team in general,‚Äù added Santamarta, who tried to be a sponge and absorb as many lessons as possible throughout the week. The young player was unable to share any time on court with Alcaraz, who arrived in Malaga from the Nitto ATP Finals in Turin and did not have as long to prepare. However, it was not the first time the two had met. Coincidentally, at last year‚Äôs Mutua Madrid Open they were champions in the event‚Äôs two men‚Äôs singles categories: ATP Masters 1000 (Alcaraz) and Under-16 (Santamarta). ‚ÄúYes, we had our photo taken at the Mutua Madrid Open when he won. He congratulated me and, now that I think of it, he told me practically the same as Rafa, to keep going, that it‚Äôs a very long road.‚Äù Photo Credit: Andres Santamarta Despite the fact that Spain‚Äôs journey at the Davis Cup came to an abrupt end in the quarter-finals, Santamarta‚Äôs adventure in Malaga continued into Wednesday. The Spaniard, who has five points in his PIF ATP Rankings account, was the man on the other side of the net as world No. 1 Jannik Sinner hit his first balls upon arrival at the Palacio de Deportes Jose Maria Martin Carpena. ‚ÄúBut I was also happy because he‚Äôs the world No. 1 and I really wanted to share a practice session with him. I really loved it. I admire him.‚Äù ¬† [ATP AWARDS] Once on court, Santamarta forgot his nerves and, just as Nadal had advised a few days before, he enjoyed the opportunity. ‚ÄúI felt very comfortable,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe thing that really struck me was the intensity, the same as with Rafa. He‚Äôs a very relaxed guy, he doesn‚Äôt get annoyed, and he plays with such intensity. He misses and he‚Äôs already prepared for the next ball. The thing I like about Sinner is how he moves and his backhand.‚Äù As a player at the GTennis Academy in his native Valencia, he had already practised with some elite players, but never of ‚Äòthis calibre‚Äô, as he put it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve learned so much and I really like it, because it‚Äôs a good experience to hit balls and train with top players. I‚Äôm going to try and take the positives, what I‚Äôve learned from them on and off the court.‚Äù He has a wish: ‚ÄúI would like to start with real tennis, the ATP and all the tournaments with adults, where you can really see the experience. I hope I can adapt, because it‚Äôs a really big change, the tennis is very different, the way they play and think.‚Äù Now, with so many memories, hope, desire and some priceless advice, he will return home to continue to make his way along that long road that lies ahead.
