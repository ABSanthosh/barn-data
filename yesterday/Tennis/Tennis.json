    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/best-of-2024-retirements-part-2",
    "description": "To mark the end of another thrilling season, ATPTour.com is unveiling our annual 'Best Of' series, which will reflect on the most intriguing rivalries, matches, comebacks, upsets and more. Icons Rafael Nadal and Dominic Thiem lead Part 2 of our 'Best Of' retirements story while Andy Murray was featured in Part 1. Rafael Nadal It was a Spanish sendoff for not only a country’s hero, nor just a tennis icon, but rather a sporting legend. Nadal competed in his final professional event in November at the Davis Cup Final 8. The 38-year-old, surrounded by teammates, friends and family, wiped away tears while addressing the crowd during an on-court ceremony. One of the best to ever compete on the ATP Tour, Nadal’s final match was a singles rubber defeat against Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp. To the loud tune of Spanish chants like ‘Vamos Rafa!’, Nadal applied the finishing touches to his career, fighting his hardest until the bitter end. “It’s been an emotional day,” Nadal said after his final match. “I knew it could be my last match as a professional tennis player. The moments leading up to it were emotional, kind of difficult to handle, in general. So many emotions. I tried to do it as well as possible.” Nadal’s sportsmanship and grace in both victory and defeat endeared him to fans worldwide. That humility was again on display when Nadal said in his farewell speech, “I’m the one who should be thankful… to so many people that it’s difficult to know where to start.” There are no words to thank you enough for what you’ve done to the sport. Gracias, Rafa ❤️@RafaelNadal | #RafaSiempre pic.twitter.com/PsYuuPbwGb — ATP Tour (@atptour) November 19, 2024 Nadal’s two-decade career was defined by competitive excellence and relentless determination. He set benchmarks that may never be surpassed, including an extraordinary record of 14 Roland Garros titles. He spent 209 weeks as No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, won 1,080 matches and lifted a whopping 92 tour-level titles. A host of Nadal’s records seem as if they could go untouched for an eternity. He won an ATP Tour title in a record 19 straight seasons (2004-22) and earned a record 23 wins vs. World No. 1s. He was ranked in the Top 10 for a record 912 consecutive weeks (2005-23). At ATP Masters 1000 events, Nadal earned a record 410 victories and second-most titles (36). The Spaniard became the first men’s player in history to complete the Career Grand Slam twice. He also won two Olympic gold medals (2008 Beijing singles, 2016 Rio doubles w/M. Lopez) and helped Spain win the Davis Cup four times. “I think as a tennis player, I just want to be remembered for the results I had. As a person, I hope to be remembered as a positive example of being respectful, well-mannered, and a good person,” Nadal said earlier this year. Read Nadal Longform Tribute. Dominic Thiem There was a buzz at Thiem's home tournament, the Erste Bank Open in Vienna, as the Austrian tennis hero said goodbye to the sport. “When I think back on my career, the main emotions are really big gratitude for everything I was able to experience,” Thiem said. “I was very lucky to stay healthy [most of] the time to be able to realise basically all my dreams. And yeah, I was never expecting a career like that when I was young. All I wanted was to be a professional tennis player, whatever comes with it.” The 31-year-old won the 2020 US Open and also reached the final of three other Slams. Thiem won a total of 17 tour-level titles, achieved a career-high PIF ATP Ranking of No. 3 and was ensconced in the Top 10 for the better part of six years. [ATP APP] Thiem achieved such success in arguably the most difficult era of tennis, with Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic not relinquishing their spots atop the sport. The only players with better Lexus ATP Head2Head records than Thiem against Federer, Nadal and Djokovic are… the Big Three themselves. One key win for Thiem came against Federer at Indian Wells in 2019. It was a thrilling championship match, which Thiem reflected on by saying, ‘Roger was toying with me’, in the early stages of the final. But the Austrian found his best level and claimed at the time what was his biggest title. It was Thiem’s lone ATP Masters 1000 triumph. Thiem’s 2020 US Open triumph was sealed with a two-sets-to-love comeback against Alexander Zverev. The Austrian stormed back and escaped the German 7-6 in a nervy fifth set from both players. It was unusually eerie inside Arthur Ashe Stadium as the final took place at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic and the whole tournament was conducted with no fans on site. There was no raucous crowd to help turn nerves into energy. Rather, it was a white-knuckle ride to the finish that featured Thiem earning one of the biggest moments of his career. Read Thiem Longform Tribute. Wesley Koolhof Koolhof knows what it is like to stand atop the PIF ATP Doubles Rankings and be crowned champion at some of the sport’s biggest events. The Dutchman won six ATP Masters 1000 titles — three each with Nikola Mektic and Neal Skupski, respectively — and the 2023 Wimbledon trophy (w/ Skupski). Koolhof qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals four times and won the season finale alongside Mektic in 2020. At this year’s event in Turin, Koolhof was celebrated for his standout career. He represented his home country one final time in Davis Cup before officially retiring. “I don’t know what will be next, but after taking some time off I’d love to stay in tennis,” Koolhof said. “In this world, you meet so many people, and tennis has always been part of my life… I will just wait and see what comes around the corner, and you'll see me somewhere.” Read Koolhof's, 'My Point' essay. Pablo Cuevas The highest-ranked Uruguayan in history (No. 19 in 2016), Cuevas’ hot shots compilation video would stand up against any player. He was a flashy shotmaker who struck the ball cleanly, as evident by his six tour-level titles. En route to his 2016 Rio de Janeiro crown, Cuevas upset Rafael Nadal in a semi-final three-setter, which was the Uruguayan’s second of three wins against Top 5 players. Cuevas, who announced his retirement in September, also won nine doubles titles, including Roland Garros in 2008 with Luis Horna. He lifted two ATP Masters 1000 doubles trophies: 2015 Rome with David Marrero and 2017 Monte-Carlo with Rohan Bopanna. “When I was a boy, I didn’t know what it meant to be a tennis player, and I didn’t have a ranking in mind that I wanted to reach, I just wanted it to be my job,” Cuevas said. “Then it became much more, being Top 100, Top 50, winning tournaments, but it was always about much more than the numbers… It was what I enjoyed doing and I was able to enjoy myself a lot along the way.” Read Cuevas Retirement Feature. Filip Krajinovic Krajinovic fought back tears as he played his final match in the US Open qualifying. The Serbian reached a career-high World No. 26, competed in five ATP Tour finals and defeated four Top 10 opponents. The career highlight that stands out the most to Krajinovic is his run to the final of the 2017 Rolex Paris Masters, his lone championship match at an ATP Masters 1000 event. “I am very proud. I'm very proud of my career,” Krajinovic said. “The only thing where I'm a little bit sad is I didn't win an ATP [title]. I had five finals, five tough finals. That's the only thing I wanted to have, but didn't happen for some reason. But everything else I would sign [for] because I think I played the way I wanted. I had very good results and my highest was 26, which I really appreciate. I left the court happy, because I think that I did well.” Read Krajinovic Retirement Feature. Donald Young In the last event of his career, Young partnered WTA player Taylor Townsend to a dream run to the US Open mixed doubles final. The former No. 38 in the PIF ATP Rankings bade farewell to a career in which he reached two tour-level finals. Born in Chicago, Young made a splash as a junior No. 1, a ranking he achieved at just 15 years old. The lefty earned tour-level wins against the likes of Andy Murray, Gael Monfils and Tomas Berdych. He twice reached the fourth round of his home Slam and faced each member of the ‘Big Three’ at major tournaments. Young will never forget his time on Tour. “It just changed the trajectory of my life, my family's life,” Young said. “And for that, I'm definitely indebted and grateful to tennis.” Read Young Retirement Feature.

    "description": "To mark the end of another thrilling season, ATPTour.com is unveiling our annual 'Best Of' series, which will reflect on the most intriguing rivalries, matches, comebacks, upsets and more. Today we look back at some of the biggest names who called time on their playing careers this year. Andy Murray leads Part 1 of this story, with Dominic Thiem and Rafael Nadal to feature in Part 2 on Sunday. Andy Murray The Scot bowed out in the most Murray-esque manner imaginable. Playing doubles at the Paris Olympics, the two-time singles gold medalist teamed with Daniel Evans. The pair won its first match against Taro Daniel and Kei Nishikori by saving five consecutive match points from a 4/9 deficit in the Match Tie-break to snatch victory. Murray and Evans were not done with their dramatic comebacks. They extended the former World No. 1 Murray's career further by surviving two match points against Sander Gille and Joran Vliegen in the second round before losing in the quarter-finals. After both wins, Murray celebrated as though he had just won the gold medal, final demonstrations of just how much the game always meant to the 46-time tour-level champion. Against all odds, #SirAndy 😤@andy_murray pic.twitter.com/zKm0GUDJXO — ATP Tour (@atptour) August 2, 2024 Murray spent 41 weeks as No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, claimed three major titles and tallied 739 singles wins in his laudable career. One key turning point came in 2012, when he captured the Olympic gold medal on the Wimbledon lawns. Later that summer he captured his first major title, the 2012 US Open, by defeating Novak Djokovic in a five-set final. The match lasted four hours, 54 minutes – tied for the second-longest US Open final in history. The next year Murray ended Great Britain’s 77-year wait for a home men's singles champion at Wimbledon. This was the day that the BBC said “turned Murray into a Wimbledon champion and a national treasure”. Winning Wimbledon was not the only thing Murray accomplished for Great Britain. In 2015, he propelled the British team to its first Davis Cup victory since 1936. The 37-year-old will be remembered for a career full of historic achievements, which he accomplished against some of the best players in the history of tennis. “I gave as much as I could to the career,” Murray said at the Paris Olympics. “There are obviously things that I look back on and wish that I could have done differently, but it’s been a tough time to win major titles in the sport with the players that were ahead of me. I’m proud of my achievements, my efforts and I’m looking forward to prolonged rest now.” Read Murray Longform Tribute. [ATP APP] Steve Johnson The California native Johnson established himself as a consistent force on the ATP Tour with his devastating forehand, lethal backhand slice and fighting spirit. Johnson turned pro in 2012 after leading the University of Southern California to four consecutive NCAA team titles and winning the singles crown twice. He completed his college career with 72 consecutive singles wins. Johnson went on to claim four tour-level singles trophies and reach a career-high No. 21 in 2016. He teamed countryman Jack Sock at the 2016 Rio Olympics, where they captured the bronze medal. For five consecutive years from 2014-18, Johnson finished inside the year-end Top 50 and always proved a tough out for any opponent. He retired in front of friends and family in Indian Wells. “As I sit here now very proud of what I accomplished, I felt like I did just about everything I could in my power to either rectify mistakes that I made, playing or all the things that go into playing tennis. I feel like I left no stone unturned. And for me, that's the most important piece,” Johnson said. “I don't want to look back and have any regrets or wish I would have done X, Y and Z. So for me, I feel very proud of what I accomplished. To have the career I had, the accomplishments and everything is super fun to look back on. But knowing that my wife and girls may not ever remember me playing tennis, but they will [see those things], that means the most to me.” Read Johnson Retirement Feature. Ivo Karlovic Propelled by his 6’11” (2.11m) frame, Karlovic boasted one of the biggest serves in tennis history. The Croatian is second on the all-time Aces leaderboard, having struck 13,728 aces, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Only John Isner has hit more (Ace count has been kept since 1991). Karlovic stepped away as an eight-time tour-level singles champion who ascended to a career-high No. 14 in 2008. At Wimbledon in 2003, Karlovic made his major debut and defeated then-defending champion Lleyton Hewitt en route to his lone Slam quarter-final. Karlovic confirmed his retirement in February, having not competed since October 2021. “I’ve had a very gratifying, unorthodox and long career coming from extremely humble beginnings, especially for a tennis player,” Karlovic said. Read Karlovic's 'My Point'. From left to right: Ivo Karlovic, John Millman, ATP Chairman Andrea Gaudenzi, Joao Sousa and Dominic Thiem at the 2024 Nitto ATP Finals. Credit: Corinne Dubreuil/ATP Tour Joao Sousa Sousa's accomplishments made him a national icon in his home country Portugal. The 35-year-old is the highest-ranked Portuguese player in PIF ATP Rankings history (No. 28, 2016). In 2013, Sousa became the first player from his country to win an ATP Tour title (Kuala Lumpur). He did not stop there. Sousa claimed four tour-level trophies and often came up against the best players in the sport, earning five Top 10 wins. He reached the fourth round at the 2018 US Open and 2019 Wimbledon. Sousa fittingly brought his career to a close in front of home fans in Estoril this year. “I couldn't ask for a better ending. I think that's the best place I could ever ask for a career ending,” Sousa said “It was very special [winning here] in 2018, with all the crowd supporting throughout the whole week. So it was just amazing to feel the love and the support from my fans at home, of course, in Portugal.” Read Sousa Retirement Feature. John Millman From the highest of highs to the lowest of lows, Millman experienced a wide range of emotions during a 14-year professional career which ended at the Australian Open. The Australian’s storied journey featured one ATP Tour title, an upset against Roger Federer en route to the 2018 US Open quarter-finals and maximising every bit of his potential — even in the face of adversity, such as multiple shoulder surgeries. “I hope people enjoyed the journey and saw that I left it all out there. If they resonate with that and that story, then I've done my job,” the former World No. 33 said. Read Millman Retirement Feature.  Federico Delbonis Delbonis was a tricky opponent, using his left-handed game to great effect and catching fans' attention with his unorthodox service motion and high ball toss. A two-time tour-level titlist, the Argentine reached a career-high No. 33 in the PIF ATP Rankings in 2016. He hung up his racquets in January. “Today is the end of one of the most enriching journeys of my life,” Delbonis said. “It is the end of a stage of my life in which I learned to be a sportsman and a person. I had some unforgettable and unbeatable moments on and off the tennis court.” Read Delbonis Retirement Feature. Ryan Harrison Harrison's game was as explosive as he was competitive. Harrison reached the Top 40 in the PIF ATP Rankings and also hit a doubles career-high No. 16. \"I consider myself one of the luckiest people in the world to have had a dream and had the opportunity to live out that dream,\" Harrison wrote in a retirement social media post in January. In 2017, Harrison was playing the best tennis of his life. He won his lone ATP Tour singles title in Memphis and partnered Michael Venus to claim the Roland Garros doubles trophy. Harrison and Venus qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals that year and reached the semi-finals. Read Harrison Retirement Feature. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
