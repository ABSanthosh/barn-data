It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/shang-jeddah-2024-media-day",
    "description": "Shang Juncheng's success has helped fuel a tennis boom in China. The first player from his nation to compete at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, the 19-year-old is now eager to be a part of the game's growth in Saudi Arabia.  \"This event, they've had so many great players in the past and a lot of good champions,\" he said. \"So I think coming here is really special, especially coming into Jeddah. Maybe a couple of years ago there wasn't too much tennis action going on, but now we have the WTA Finals and the Next Gen Finals here, so I'm really looking forward to it.\" [ATP APP] Shang enters Jeddah as a member of the Top 50 in the PIF ATP Rankings, having reached a career-high of No. 47 in October after winning his first tour-level title in Chengdu. He lost just one set in that run at the ATP 250 and beat Lorenzo Musetti in the final. Despite his quick rise up the rankings — and his more than $1 million in prize money this season — Shang remains the same person as his game evolves. \"I think I'm still the same happy kid,\" he said. \"I try to be happy on the court, try to learn every day what I can do better what needs to be improved. I think it's just a little bit of a challenge each day to make me a better player.\" Shang posted a 5-3 record at the Grand Slams this season (he bowed out in qualifying at Roland Garros) and reached the main-draw second round at all four ATP Masters 1000s at which he competed. Apart from his Chengdu title, he singled out his performance at the majors as a season highlight and took particular pride in completing the year without injury or illness. Ironically, he had an eye infection early in the offseason, but he still enjoyed some downtime on holiday in Dubai, complete with shopping and beach time. In recent months, Shang has also started a gluten-free diet, part of an overall effort to live a more professional lifestyle. Shang's parents are also key influences. His father, Yi, was a professional football player; his mother, Na, was a world champion table tennis player. \"I think the mentality is the same, that you go on court, you try 100 per cent,\" he said about taking lessons from their sporting careers. \"That's what they've been telling me all the time: You've got to be a competitor, but at the same time you've got to know your values — that maybe sometimes winning is not the most important thing. More to enjoy the competition and enjoy the people watching you. I think at the end of the day it's [the people] who are next to you that's the most important thing.\" While Shang and his fellow Jeddah competitors continue to learn about life as professional tennis players, their experience at the Next Gen ATP Finals provides a rare chance to compete exclusively amongst peers. \"The eight of us here, we know each other inside-out. We grew up all together, we're all around the same age,\" he said. \"It's really special because on Tour you play the older guys, not people your age. So coming here, I think it's some sort of pressure that I'm playing kids that are like me, my age.\" [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/mensik-jeddah-2024-media-day",
    "description": "Jakub Mensik earned his debut at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF with a breakout season that included four Top 10 wins. One of four Jeddah competitors inside the Top 50 of the PIF ATP Rankings — alongside Arthur Fils, Alex Michelsen and Shang Juncheng — Mensik knew before the 2024 season started that he wanted to end it at the 20-and-under showcase event. \"It was one of my biggest goals to reach this event before the season,\" he said this week. \"I'm glad to be here. So far it's amazing, the facilities and everything that they did for us. You can feel really that you're one of the best younger players in the world.\" [ATP APP] Throughout his rise, Mensik has always been able to count on the unwavering support of his parents, Michal and Katerina. Both his parents are in Jeddah, and they have regularly travelled with Mensik since his junior tennis days. The family are frequent flyers now, but they recalled an airport mishap years ago, long before Mensik grew accustomed to the nomadic life. When he was nine, the family was waiting at baggage claim when Mensik became distracted by a cat. After going over to investigate, he lost track of his parents, who left the baggage area before realising their son had gone missing. Mensik remembers a scary wait until his father returned: \"From nowhere, my dad appeared after 30, 45 minutes, and everything was good,\" he said with a laugh. It will be hard to lose sight of Mensik this week as he competes under the spotlight of the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. While Mensik exceeded all outside expectations this year on the ATP Tour, the 19-year-old is not putting himself under any undue pressure in Jeddah. As the third seed, he will open his campaign against Learner Tien on Wednesday. \"I never have expectations,\" he explained. \"Obviously just to enjoy this beautiful tournament. Of course I would be happy to win a couple of matches and of course I'm going here to win it.\" Mensik took a similar approach at his first ATP Tour tournament this February in Doha, where he beat Andrey Rublev en route to the final. He also beat Rublev on his way to the quarter-finals at the Rolex Shanghai Masters, where he pushed his idol Novak Djokovic to three sets. Mensik lists those two weeks as the highlights of his year, along with representing Czechia at the Olympics and Davis Cup.  He'll hope to end his 2024 campaign with another week to remember in Jeddah.
