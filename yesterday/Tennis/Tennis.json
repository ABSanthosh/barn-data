The Briton, who won the Washington title in 2023, claimed a hard-fought win against Zizou Bergs 3-6, 6-4, 6-3. The 35-year-old wild card let out a loud roar and pumped his fists towards his box in a fiery celebration following the two-hour, 29-minute battle. Look at what it means!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• 2023 champion Dan Evans digs deep to overcome Bergs 3-6 6-4 6-3 to progress in Washington. @mubadalacitidc | #MubadalaCitiDCOpen pic.twitter.com/BBnWEPu1dA ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) July 21, 2025 ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always said even when I was solidified in the Top 30, Top 40, that winning on this Tour is never easy,‚Äù said Evans, former No. 21 in the PIF ATP Rankings. ‚ÄúThe best part about winning on the Tour is now going to the bike to warm down and be with the people who work with you day in and day out. ‚ÄúSometimes we take it for granted, but the last year ‚Äî or two years ‚Äî has been difficult and I definitely enjoy it and cherish it every moment I get on these courts because it‚Äôs coming towards the end of my career, there‚Äôs no hiding from that.‚Äù The World No. 144 will next face 13th-seeded American Alex Michelsen. In other action at the ATP 500, Reilly Opelka crushed 23 aces, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to overcome Murphy Cassone 7-6(4), 6-7(5), 6-3 and set a second-round showdown against Daniil Medvedev. The eighth seed Medvedev leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 4-2, but Opelka won their most recent meeting in 's-Hertogenbosch last month. Opelka was one of four Americans who advanced. #NextGenATP teen Learner Tien raced past Emilio Nava 6-1, 6-4 while wild card Ethan Quinn downed Christopher O‚ÄôConnell 6-3, 6-2.
