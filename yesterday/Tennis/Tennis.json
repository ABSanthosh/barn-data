Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/monfils-australian-open-2025-feature",
    "description": "Gael Monfils’ reaction Saturday said it all. The 38-year-old had just upset fourth seed Taylor Fritz in the third round of the Australian Open, becoming the third-oldest player (behind Ken Rosewall twice) to defeat a top-five opponent at a major in the history of the PIF ATP Rankings (since 1973). What did he do? Break out into a dance. “It was very natural. I wanted to dance, so I danced,” Monfils later told his former coach, Roger Rasheed, in an interview. “It was a way for me to express my happiness.” Happy is a good word to describe Monfils’ state right now. His smile spoke for itself as he shimmied to the net to shake hands with Fritz, with the crowd delighted by the result. “I keep playing for those matches. Play a big player, big stadium, good crowd, good energy,” Monfils said. “When you're 38 years old, is what I want. I had it. I was very fortunate to win it.” That moment of joy remained with the Frenchman. Well after the match, when Monfils was preparing to meet with the media, he was joking around with American Frances Tiafoe just inside the locker room doors. It is fitting given Monfils and Tiafoe are two of the biggest crowd favourites on the ATP Tour. As Monfils opened the door to head upstairs for his press conference and broadcast interviews, waiting for the former No. 6 in the PIF ATP Rankings was wife Elina Svitolina, who was getting ready for her own third-round match at Melbourne Park. The 38-year-old departed the Australian Open players’ area to walk towards the elevator to the media level and passed by WTA player Taylor Townsend, enjoying a quick laugh with the American lefty, then walked by the man he had just defeated, Fritz. There is plenty of hype around Monfils in Australia. Before arriving, he triumphed in Auckland to become the oldest man to claim a tour-level trophy since 1977. Just how far can he go? Does the Frenchman think he could win the tournament? “That's your dream, I guess, to win a Slam. I’ll tell you my dream,” Monfils said. “My dream is to have an unbelievable family. Tennis is cool. Of course, you want to have goals, dreams, whatever. But my dream is out there.” All of the 13-time ATP Tour champion’s results are a bonus for him, though. Monfils has previously pointed out that his dream was to crack the world’s Top 10. He achieved that, has competed on the world’s biggest stages, won 574 tour-level matches and earned nearly $24 million in career prize money. Playing in front of and entertaining fans thrills Monfils still. Having fun makes him happy. “A couple of years ago I wasn’t sure about tennis anymore,” Monfils told ESPN’s Chris McKendry. But Svitolina played a big part in helping push him forward. “Let’s go Gael, let’s go! Let’s go Gael, let’s go!” French fans chanted that phrase repeatedly from below the ESPN studio, and Monfils repaid the people with a grateful wave from ESPN. The fans extend beyond the crowd, too. Many players in the locker room grew up watching the Frenchman. An example is his next opponent, Ben Shelton. \"There's this one highlight tape I feel like everyone has watched on YouTube that's just nuts. For me it's probably the greatest tennis highlight tape of all time. It's Gael, just a lot of athletic plays,\" Shelton said. \"One of them being, I think it was at Roland Garros when he dove for that overhead and then ended up winning the point. He was going nuts. \"So for me if there's one guy in all of sports you're, like, 'That guy has the greatest mixtape'... for me it's Gael Monfils.\" [ATP APP] In his various interviews, Monfils spoke about the importance of hard work, belief and his “great team”. That has helped him age like fine wine, as Rasheed later joked with him. Monfils is also fully aware of how well he is playing at the moment. Rasheed asked the No. 32 player in the PIF ATP Live Rankings about his tie-break performance against Fritz, losing just one point. “Flawless. Flawless,” Monfils said with a big smile. But perhaps part of what is allowing him to perform so well is that he does not need a certain result to be happy. Monfils spoke with great delight about his daughter Skaï and his family overall. The last request Monfils fulfilled was a selfie video with the ATP Tour. After a whirlwind of a day, the fans’ favourite spoke in his native French. “Thank you everybody! I hope you all speak French and see you all in the second week. See you soon!” “Subtitles!” Monfils said after stopping the video. The two-time Australian Open quarter-finalist then returned downstairs quickly to head to his wife’s match. Svitolina rallied for a three-set victory and after departing Margaret Court Arena, the same court her husband had won on just hours before, Monfils was waiting to take her bag and walk off into the night.

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/sinner-giron-australian-open-2025-saturday",
    "description": "Although Jannik Sinner booked his ticket to the fourth round at the Australian Open with a straight-sets win Saturday, the top seed and defending champion is seeking improvement in his game as he enters the second week. The 23-year-old Italian delivered a typically rock-solid performance en route to a 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 victory over Marcos Giron under the lights inside Rod Laver Arena. Sinner offered no let up from the baseline as he asserted his dominance and improved to 2-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.  “I am very happy to be in the next round,” Sinner said in his on-court interview. “Every match has its own difficulties. Today I felt like he was very solid from the back of the court when he served well. I still have room to improve, but every win is great, especially in these conditions. As always, thank you so much for your support, it’s amazing to play night sessions here. “Today the percentage of my net game was not really good, but I try to improve, it’s part of the game. Sometimes I feel things a little bit better, sometimes worse, that's normal. Trying to stay there mentally is the most important aspect. Hopefully in the next round I am able to raise my level, but I’m still very happy.” The title defense is still alive 💥@janniksin reaches the round of 16 at the @AustralianOpen for the fourth time.#AusOpen pic.twitter.com/JrCqrGUB2L — ATP Tour (@atptour) January 18, 2025 After dropping a set for the first time since early October against home wild card Tristan Schoolkate in the second round, Sinner locked in to earn an early service break against Giron in each set. Although he dropped serve in the final set, the 23-year-old saved six of seven break points, according to Infosys Stats. Sinner’s two-hour, one-minute victory was the shortest of his three so far during his 2025 campaign in Melbourne, and will offer a welcome sense of confidence as he heads into the second week of a Grand Slam for a 15th time. The two-time major champion crucially won four consecutive points from 0/30 when serving for the second set, underpinned by two ferocious forehand winners. Giron, the No. 46 in the PIF ATP Rankings, continued to make inroads on Sinner’s serve and was eventually rewarded with his first break to level the third set at 2-2. From there, however, Sinner regrouped to race across the line and become the third Italian man to reach the fourth round in Melbourne on four occasions after Fabio Fognini and Andreas Seppi. Awaiting Sinner next in his quest for a third consecutive hard-court major title is World No. 13 Holger Rune, who rallied for a 6-7(5), 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 win over Miomir Kecmanovic. The Serbian was on the cusp of victory when he served at 4-2, 30/0 in the fourth set, but Rune conjured some inspired shot-making to reel off four consecutive games and level the match. Struggling with cramp in the deciding set, Rune’s main objective was to shorten the points, and this paved the way for an entertaining end to the clash. The Dane outhit Kecmanovic 83 winners to 45 and crucially broke serve at 4-all in the final set to secure a three-hour, 27-minute victory. “I have no idea [how I won], I could not have done it without the fantastic crowd,” Rune said in his on-court interview. “I was feeling super exhausted but you guys lifted me up, so thank you from the bottom of my heart. “I was so tired so I needed to find a solution. I wasn’t able to run 15 balls side to side, so I had to go for it when I had the chance. Miomir had an amazing match, we played a couple of times before and he is just a big competitor, so credit to him.” Sinner and Rune's Lexus ATP Head2Head series is evenly poised at 2-2, with the Italian claiming each of their two previous matches.  [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
