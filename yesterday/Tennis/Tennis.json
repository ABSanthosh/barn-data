    "description": "Lorenzo Musetti notched the first Top 10 win of his Grand Slam career with a measured performance Sunday night at Roland Garros. The Italian wore down 10th seed Holger Rune after a competitive start and advanced to his second major quarter-final with a 7-5, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 victory. In the first match of the fortnight between Top 10 players in the PIF ATP Rankings, World No. 7 Musetti dominated the final two sets to earn his first Lexus ATP Head2Head win in three tries against Rune. As the steady Italian asserted his superiority in the rallies on Court Philippe-Chatrier, Rune adopted an aggressive game plan with frequent net charges but could not prevent the Italian from closing out the win in three hours, 18 minutes. Musetti will bid to match his Wimbledon semi-final run from last year when he takes on Frances Tiafoe, who has yet to drop a set in the tournament. A dramatic close to the opening set saw the players trade breaks from 5-4, with Musetti serving out the set at the second time of asking. Rune answered well to level in set two but could not match his opponent in the rallies as the match wore on. The 10th Italian man to reach the Roland Garros quarters in the Open Era, Musetti could meet countryman and World No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the final. MAGNIFIQUE FROM MUSETTI ðŸ”¥ He overcomes Rune 7-5 3-6 6-3 6-2 to cement his spot in the QFs ðŸŒŸ#rolandgarros #musetti pic.twitter.com/62lOnZnkGG â€” ATP Tour (@atptour) June 1, 2025 Tiafoe is also through to his first Roland Garros quarter-final after a 6-3, 6-4, 7-6(4) result against unseeded German Daniel Altmaier. The American's four wins this fortnight equal his win total in nine previous main-draw appearances at the clay-court major. He is the first American to reach the Roland Garros quarters without losing a set since Andre Agassi in 1995. He is joined by Tommy Paul in the quarters, marking the first time the U.S. has had two men in that stage since 1996. Tiafoe's win was a measure of revenge for his friend and countryman Taylor Fritz, after Altmaier knocked out the fourth seed in the opening round. He won 30 of 37 net points in the victory, according to Infosys Stats. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
