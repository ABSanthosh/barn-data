It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Carlos Alcaraz is pursuing more than an ATP Masters 1000 trophy this week at the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters. The Spaniard is closing on a return to the top two of the PIF ATP Rankings. According to the PIF ATP Live Rankings, if the Spaniard claims his first crown in The Principality, he will pass Alexander Zverev for World No. 2 next Monday. If Alcaraz does not triumph in Monte-Carlo, he will remain World No. 3. PIF ATP Live Rankings (Monte-Carlo Quarter-finalists)   Player  Current Pts Max Pts   3) Carlos Alcaraz  6920  7720  8) Alex de Minaur  3335  4135  13) Arthur Fils  2820  3620  14) Lorenzo Musetti  2750  3550  16) Stefanos Tsitsipas  2645  3445   17) Grigor Dimitrov  2595  3395  25) Alexei Popyrin  1860  2660   37) Alejandro Davidovich Fokina  1480  2280  Current Live No. 10: Casper Ruud (eliminated), 3,215 points Alcaraz could finish the week with as many as 7,720 points. Zverev, who lost his second-round match to Matteo Berrettini, has 7,595 points. Both are well clear of No. 4 Taylor Fritz, who has 5,280 points. Alcaraz became the youngest World No. 1 in the history of the PIF ATP Rankings (since 1973) on 12 September 2022. He has remained in the top three since then and has a chance in Monte-Carlo to further secure his standing. The 21-year-old is one of only two players in the Top 12 of the PIF ATP Live Rankings still alive in the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters. Because of that, there are opportunities for players to crack the Top 10. The current live No. 10 is Casper Ruud, who has 3,215 points. If No. 13 Arthur Fils reaches the final, he will have 3,270 points, enough to move into the live Top 10. The Frenchman would surge to 3,620 points and as high as World No. 7 by earning his first Masters 1000 title. Lorenzo Musetti is another player who could make his Top 10 breakthrough. The Italian, live No. 14, needs to win the title to achieve the feat. Musetti, like Fils, can soar as high as No. 7. Nos. 16 and 17, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Grigor Dimitrov, would return to the Top 10 by triumphing this week. No. 25 Alexei Popyrin won his first Masters 1000 title last year in Montreal. If the Australian adds to his Masters 1000 collection with another crown, he will ascend to as high as No. 16. Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, the 2022 Monte-Carlo finalist, is three victories from skyrocketing from No. 37 to No. 20 [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
