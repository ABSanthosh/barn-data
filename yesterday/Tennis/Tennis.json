    "description": "The wide slice serve is a CRITICAL tool to have in your tool box. It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/roland-garros-2025-doubles-final",
    "description": "Nearly six years after partnering for the first time at Montreal in 2019, Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos won their first Grand Slam title as a team Saturday evening in Paris. The fifth seeds, who have long been one of the top duos on the ATP Tour, defeated eighth seeds Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski 6-0, 6-7(5), 7-5 to win the Roland Garros title. \"It's a unique joy. Ever since I was a kid, I dreamed of winning Roland Garros, and today we finally did it after several chances,\" Zeballos said. \"I am very happy and I dedicate this to my family and our team.\" This was Granollers and Zeballos’ fourth major final together. They previously fell one victory short at the 2019 US Open and Wimbledon in 2021 and 2023. But on this occasion, they found a way to secure the crown. One miraculous shot might have been the difference between winning and losing. Granollers faced two break points at 3-3 in the deciding set when Zeballos hit arguably the shot of the tournament. The Britons took control of the point and crashed the net, with Salisbury eventually finding an sharp angle from deuce court to deuce court inside the service box. The ball went well outside the doubles alley and Zeballos’ only option was to flick a backhand between the netpost and sponsor signage, which were separated by half a metre. The Argentine did just that, saving the game with a shot that was so difficult, his opponents broke into laughter. Instead of falling behind by a service break late in the third set, Granollers and Zeballos escaped the game and eventually won the match. The champions, who hit 46 winners according to Infosys Stats, enjoyed an emotional celebration on Court Philippe-Chatrier. \"The best thing we did today was to stay mentally strong, and we had to make the difference when we needed,\" Zeballos said. Granollers said: \"I'm happy to have won it with Horacio. We've had many years of good results, and the major finals we lost were difficult moments, but we knew how to persevere. We never stopped trying, and today we have our reward\" Granollers and Zeballos are now third in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings. They are trying to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals for the sixth consecutive year as a pair. Britons Salisbury and Skupski began their full-time partnership this season and claimed their first Lexus ATP Head2Head victory against Granollers and Skupski in Rome, 6-3, 6-2. But they were unable to replicate that success in their first major final together. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/roland-garros-2025-boys-final",
    "description": "German Niels McDonald won his first Grand Slam boys’ singles title on Saturday when he defeated countryman Max Schoenhaus 6-7(5), 6-0, 6-3 in the Roland Garros final. “I’m extremely happy to start here [among] all the players and end up winning the tournament. It's an honour after probably a lot of legends have won this,” McDonald said. “But also, it's just one step of a big goal and dream I'm chasing that I started [in my] early years. So today or tomorrow we can celebrate, but at the end, then we also go back to work. Then we keep working to maybe play here on the big stage one day.” The 17-year-old, who is coached by Gianluca Marchiori, ousted four seeded opponents, including top seed Andres Santmarta Roig, en route to the trophy. He won 70 per cent of his second-serve points in the final, according to Infosys Stats. There was excitement among the finalists before the championship clash. German national coach Philipp Petzschner, the former No. 35 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, had agreed that if a German won the title, he would get a haircut of their choice. Since two players from the country made the final, Petzschner got his haircut before the final. “We went to the barbershop yesterday at 6:30. We booked an appointment for him,” McDonald said. “First we wanted to do like an Avatar haircut, just like an arrow on his head. Then watching it live, we were dying of laughter. Then we ended up feeling so bad we said, ‘Alright, shave everything off’.” Photo: Peter Staples/ATP Tour McDonald became the first German boys’ singles champion at Roland Garros since Daniel Elsner in 1997 and the first German boy to win a major singles title since Alexander Zverev at the 2014 Australian Open. “It’s an absolute honour and pleasure to win this tournament,” McDonald said. “And I'm more than happy to raise the trophy here.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
