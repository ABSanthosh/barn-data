    "description": "The wide slice serve is a CRITICAL tool to have in your tool box. It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let‚Äôs take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Novak Djokovic is set to return to action in the first week of the 2025 season at the Brisbane International presented by Evie. The former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings and 99-time tour-level titlist will aim to kick-start his season when he lines up in the field at the hard-court tournament for just the second time. Djokovic fell to Ernests Gulbis on his only previous appearance at the ATP 250 in Queensland in 2009. [ATP APP] Djokovic, whose only title in 2024 came at the Paris Olympics, will chase the 100th tour-level trophy of his career in Brisbane. The 37-year-old is trying to join Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103) as the only ATP stars to hit that milestone. A record 10-time Australian Open champion, Djokovic has not competed since he fell to Jannik Sinner in the Rolex Shanghai Masters championship match on 13 October. Currently the World No. 7, the Serbian will lead a field that also includes his fellow Top 10 star and 2023 Brisbane champion Grigor Dimitrov. Last year‚Äôs finalist Holger Rune and Frances Tiafoe will also compete, while home favourite Nick Kyrgios is set to make his long-awaited return to competitive action. It will be the 29-year-old Kyrgios‚Äô first ATP Tour appearance since June 2023 due to injury. Defending Champion Rublev Leads Hong Kong Field World No. 8 Andrey Rublev will defend his title at the Bank of China Hong Kong Tennis Open. Chinese stars Shang Juncheng and Buyunchaokete are also on the entry list in Hong Kong, where home hopes will be lead by Coleman Wong. Hong Kong played a significant rise in Shang's 2024 rise up the PIF ATP Rankings: He reached his maiden ATP Tour semi-final at the event, before going onto lift his maiden tour-level title in Chengdu. The 19-year-old finished the year as the World No. 50 and he will compete in the upcoming Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF in Jeddah. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/atp-awards-2024-coach-nominees",
    "description": "Before champions are crowned in front of packed stadiums on the ATP Tour, they are made on the practice court under the watchful eye of their coaches. These coaches often work in the background, happy to leave the glory to their players. In the 2024 ATP Awards, our five Coach of the Year nominees step into the spotlight. This year's nominees are Xavier Malisse (coach of Alexei Popyrin),¬†Emmanuel Planque (Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard),¬†Michael Russell (Taylor Fritz),¬†Brad Stine (Tommy Paul) and¬†James Trotman (Jack Draper). The nominees and winner in this category are voted on by fellow coaches. ATP Awards winners will be announced during Awards Week, starting Monday, 9 December. [ATP APP] Xavier Malisse (Alexei Popyrin) As part of Popyrin's coaching team alongside Neville Godwin, Malisse ‚Äî a former Top 20 player in the PIF ATP Rankings ‚Äî has helped the Aussie climb to the cusp of that elite group this season. Under the tutelage of Malisse and Godwin, a former Top 100 player himself, Popyrin won the biggest title of his career at the Cincinnati ATP Masters 1000 and entered the Top 25 for the first time. \"Neville and I worked a lot on the backhand. We've been working on more variety, slicing a little bit, and then working with the serve,\" said Malisse, who also credited fitness coach Evan Jenkins and physiotherapist Valentin Hollier for improving Popyrin's strength. Malisse and Godwin also emphasised patience with Popyrin, encouraging him to work the points more and attack at the right moment. Malisse's coaching style in his own words: \"Neville and I are a little bit different. When we are at the match, Neville might be a bit more intense sometimes, talking to Alexei. I stay more very relaxed, try to keep emotions in check, which is not always easy. But I like to say little things at the right time. I think coaching is knowing when to say something.\" Emmanuel Planque (Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard) Planque guided the 21-year-old Mpetshi Perricard to a breakout season, with the Frenchman winning his first two ATP Tour titles (Lyon, Basel) and breaking into the Top 30 of the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time. \"Giovanni had an excellent 2024 season, managing to improve his way of playing week after week,\" said Planque, pointing to the four tournaments (including three on the ATP Challenger Tour) Perricard won from February to May. \"He is starting to become familiar with high-level matches. The end of the season sent us this message by winning in Basel. However, we are aware that we still have a lot of work to do to one day be among the best players.\" Mpetshi Perricard was also nominated for a 2024 ATP Award, in the Most Improved Player category. Planque's coaching style in his own words: \"It's never really easy to define your way of working. Certainly, I am demanding and I strongly believe in work values but in fact, I simply hope to be a human, fair, and respectful coach of the athletes with whom I work.‚Äù Coach of the Year üòé #ATPAwards pic.twitter.com/fElcl0XNFH ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) November 25, 2024 Michael Russell (Taylor Fritz) Russell helped Fritz reach his first Grand Slam final at the US Open as well as his first title match at the Nitto ATP Finals. After posting a 17-4 record at the Grand Slams, more than doubling his previous high for major wins in a year, the American finished the season at a career-high PIF ATP Ranking of No. 4. Asked where he made the biggest impact on Fritz's game this season, Russell's response was indicative of his holistic approach to coaching: \"I think there is some impact in all parts of his game to continuing to be physically stronger and more explosive on and off the court, to being more comfortable finishing points at the net as well as having more confidence in pressure situations and stages.\" Russell's coaching style in his own words: \"My coaching style would be a mix of holistic, democratic, and autocratic. You have to have open communication and be empathetic while still creating structure and accountability. Taylor and I have a very good synergistic relationship.\" Brad Stine (Tommy Paul) Stine helped Paul win three titles this season (Dallas, Queen's Club, Stockholm) after the American entered 2024 with just one ATP Tour trophy to his name. Those three winning weeks, plus a final run in Delray Beach, led Paul to finish the year at a career-high PIF ATP Ranking of No. 12. Stine feels his biggest impact on Paul this season was on the mental side of the game, particularly his \"commitment to his identity as a player and his mental toughness\". Stine's coaching style in his own words: \"Collaborative.\" James Trotman (Jack Draper) Trotman was in Draper's corner for the Briton's breakout season, which included his first two tour-level titles in Stuttgart and Vienna. Set to turn 23 on 22 December, Draper will finish the year at a career-high PIF ATP Ranking of No. 15. \"I think the biggest area I helped Jack with his tennis this season was to play more aggressively, especially in the bigger moments in matches,\" Trotman said of his season alongside the British No. 1. \"A mentality in those situations to play to win.\" Draper was also nominated for a 2024 ATP Award, in the Most Improved Player category. Trotman's coaching style in his own words: \"My coaching style would be very much around sticking to a plan and not being too reactive, given the nature of the Tour with its ups and downs. Try to identify those areas of development and be consistent with the work to make those improvements over time.\" [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
