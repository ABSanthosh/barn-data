Let‚Äôs take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "More than 10,000 kilometres apart, Americans Brandon Holt and Aleksandar Kovacevic collected trophies Sunday on the ATP Challenger Tour. Holt, the son of former WTA World No. 1 Tracy Austin, won his maiden Challenger title at the Bangkok Open 3 while Kovacevic was crowned champion at the Oeiras Indoor 2 in Portugal. Holt and Kovacevic travelled to their respective events following second-round appearances in Australian Open qualifying. They each dropped just one set en route to their title runs. The 26-year-old Holt defeated top-seeded Czech Vit Kopriva 6-3, 6-2 in the championship match. Following his triumph, the California native is up 34 spots to No. 176 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. [ATP APP] ‚ÄúThis is the first Challenger I‚Äôve won. I made a final last year, so off to a good start in 2025,‚Äù Holt said. ‚ÄúIt was pretty warm so I think fitness was big. I think I did a good job managing the heat, staying fit and staying in long rallies. We had a lot of long rallies, especially in the final. I think I won the majority of those points and in the end, that‚Äôs everything. You win by a small margin in a lot of these matches and fortunately I was able to come out with a win every single time this tournament.‚Äù In Oeiras, top seed Kovacevic downed Hungarian Zsombor Piros 6-4, 7-6(4) in the final to claim his fifth Challenger title.Trophy time in Oeiras üëè#ATPChallenger pic.twitter.com/dCRcLPWnnC‚Äî ATP Challenger Tour (@ATPChallenger) January 19, 2025 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very happy,‚Äù said Kovacevic, No. 104 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. ‚ÄúI think the focus has been on getting my tennis level up. When I first broke the Top 100, my focus was getting my level high and then the results kind of came with that. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to do again because maybe I went away from that a little this past year.‚Äù Kovacevic, 26, was defending points from his second-round appearance at last year‚Äôs Australian Open, during which the American earned his first major main-draw win. Peru‚Äôs Juan Pablo Varillas won the AAT Challenger Santander Tigre in Argentina, where the fourth seed ousted Paraguay‚Äôs Adolfo Daniel Vallejo 6-4, 6-4 in the title match, which was moved to Monday due to rain.

    "description": "A disappointing exit will not stop Alex Michelsen drawing positives from his breakthrough campaign at the 2025 Australian Open. The American surged into the fourth round at a major for the first time at Melbourne Park, where he defeated seeds Stefanos Tsitsipas and Karen Khachanov en route before falling to Alex de Minaur in straight sets on Monday night. ‚ÄúIt was a good tournament. Probably seven out of 10, just because I played pretty poorly tonight,‚Äù reflected Michelsen after De Minaur‚Äôs 6-0, 7-6(5), 6-3 win. ‚ÄúIt is what it is. You can't win them all. I‚Äôm super happy because it's the second week of a Slam for the first time.‚Äù Despite delivering a patchy display that ended in straight-sets defeat, Michelsen still had positives to draw from his fourth-round performance inside Rod Laver Arena. He could have folded after De Minaur reeled off the first eight games of the match, but Michelsen dug deep to rally from 2-4 in the second set and force a tie-break. ‚ÄúI was super happy with the way I fought,‚Äù said the American. ‚ÄúI put myself in a position to almost win a set playing poorly against a Top 10 player. I was super happy with that. He came up with the goods in the breaker. Hit that forehand pass at 5/4 and the ace at 5-all. Credit to him there. ‚ÄúSuper happy with even getting it to a breaker there in that set, because it did not feel very good in the first hour of the match. It was really poor. So super happy to just compete and almost find a way in that second set.‚Äù Michelsen identified the change in conditions from his previous matches as part of the reason he was slow to settle in his third Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with De Minaur. ‚ÄúIt was my first night match of the tournament,‚Äù said the American. ‚ÄúI played during the day when it was hot every single time, and then played tonight, a little colder. I felt like the ball was coming at me a lot slower. I wasn't getting my feet set properly. I think that was a big part of it. ‚ÄúI was definitely a little nervous, but that wasn't really why I lost eight games in a row. I just couldn't find my feet. Obviously playing a guy like Alex, who is not going to give you anything for free, that's always in the back of your head when the balls fluff up quickly, you can't hit a winner.‚Äù DEMON TURNS IT UP AT HOME üòàüì£He brings the force to move into the quarter-finals with a 6-0 7-6(5) 6-3 win over Michelsen‚Ä¶ üî•#AO2025 pic.twitter.com/Ir2ld9Q2xq‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) January 20, 2025 Despite Monday‚Äôs disappointment, Michelsen has risen to No. 36 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, setting him up for a new career high on Monday. The three-time ATP Tour finalist believes he has plenty to build on for the rest of 2025. ‚ÄúI definitely have goals that I don't want to say in a press conference, but I definitely do have goals,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don't put too much pressure on myself in terms of ranking. I'm 20 years old. 36th in the world. I know that that's very good, and I'm very happy with that right now.‚Äù [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
