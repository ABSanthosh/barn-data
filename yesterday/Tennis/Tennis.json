    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/deminaur-vienna-2024-friday",
    "description": "Alex de Minaur kept his hopes of qualifying for the Nitto ATP Finals alive by dispatching #NextGenATP star Jakub Mensik 6-7(2), 6-3, 6-4 on Friday, to reach the semi-finals at the Erste Bank Open. The 25-year-old, currently ninth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, dug deep and emerged victorious in two hours and 34 minutes. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs crunch time. Every match counts. Every single point counts,‚Äù de Minaur said. ‚ÄúI am gonna do my best. I haven‚Äôt played enough tennis this year, I have been sidelined for a while. So, plenty of energy and plenty of fight in me. So, I am going to make sure I give it my all every time I step out on court.‚Äù Mensik was the first to switch gears as the opening set went into a tie-break. He employed aggressive groundstrokes and forced errors from the Australian to claim the first set 7-6(2). He fired 24 winners in the first set, including nine aces, according to the Infosys ATP Stats. De Minaur responded by earning a crucial break in the sixth game of the second set and leveled the match by clinching the set 6-3. The Australian improved his serve and won 70 per cent (21/30) of points behind his first delivery. Going all in, the Australian broke Mensik again in the fifth game of the third set and stayed in control for the rest of the match. Bidding to make his debut at the season-ending championships, de Minaur took a 1-0 lead in the pair‚Äôs Lexus ATP Head2Head series and reached his 25th tour-level semi-final. Despite the loss, Mensik remains on track to qualify for the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF in December. The 19-year-old is third in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah. De Minaur will play Karen Khachanov for a spot in the final. [ATP APP] Khachanov defeated Matteo Berrettini 6-1, 6-4, and extended his winning streak to seven matches. The 28-year-old, who won the Almaty Open last week, dispatched the Italian in one hour and 18 minutes to reach his first semi-final at the ATP 500 tournament in Vienna. Khachanov gained momentum early on with his aggressive play. He broke Berrettini twice, fired 10 winners, and made two unforced errors in the first set. Berrettini stayed on par by holding serve in the second set, including back-to-back love holds in his first two service games. But the seven-time tour-level titlist proved too strong and needed a single break point in the ninth game to emerge victorious. He was also successful while charging forward, claiming 100 per cent (7/7) of points at the net. With the win, Khachanov registered his first victory in the pair‚Äôs Lexus ATP Head2Head Series, which Berrettini leads 4-1. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Holger Rune‚Äôs impressive form at the Swiss Indoors Basel showed no signs of slowing down on Friday. The 21-year-old booked his spot in a third consecutive semi-final in Basel after defeating lucky loser David Goffin 6-2, 6-4. Rune was relentless throughout his 80-minute victory, during which he carved out 11 break points, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Dazzling into the semis üåü@holgerrune2003 has his eyes on the prize in Basel, the No. 4 seed dismisses Goffin 6-2 6-4!#SwissIndoorsBasel pic.twitter.com/A6BHhTAaNz ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) October 25, 2024 Rune, who is yet to drop a set this week, is into his 20th tour-level semi-final. With his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head win over Goffin, Rune became the fourth man to reach more than seven ATP Tour semi-finals in 2024. After improving to a 10-2 record in Basel, Rune is ¬†up to 14th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, 1,045 points adrift of eighth-placed Andrey Rublev. [ATP APP] Rune wasted little time in taking a stranglehold on the contest. He dismantled Goffin‚Äôs serve on two occasions to surge to a 4-0 lead before closing out the first set in 39 minutes. Goffin ignited hopes of a comeback in the second set when he clawed back a break of serve to level the score at 4-4. However, Rune dialled in to reclaim the advantage and serve out the contest with ease. Rune will next face Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard for a spot in the championship match in Basel. After taking down two-time-defending champion Felix Auger-Aliassime on Thursday, Mpetshi Perricard maintained solid momentum against Denis Shapovalov on Friday. The Frenchman staged a gritty comeback and ousted the resurgent Canadian 6-7(7), 6-3, 7-6(3), to reach the semi-finals. Playing his third tour-level quarter-final, Mpetshi Perricard emerged victorious in two hours and six minutes. Using his booming serve to take charge, he hit 46 winners, including 27 aces. The Frenchman also won 81 per cent (58/72) of first-serve points and claimed 50 per cent (12/24) of points at the net. The Frenchman has hit 70 aces in three matches this week, and a total of 445 aces in 24 matches for the 2024 season, averaging 18.5 aces per match. The 21-year-old, who started 2024 ranked No. 205, has moved back to his career-high No. 44 by reaching the semi-finals; he is third-highest Frenchman in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. Shapovalov was seeking his 21st tour-level semi-final. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
