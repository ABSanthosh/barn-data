    "description": "Joao Fonseca joined illustrious company by triumphing on Sunday at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. The Brazilian joined Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz as the only 18 year olds to win the event and was brimming from ear to ear following his four-set final win against Learner Tien. Fonseca was proud of his undefeated run in Jeddah, but insisted it was just the start. ‚ÄúIf you told Joao at the start of the year that he did all the things he did this year, he would think it is amazing,‚Äù Fonseca said. ‚ÄúIt is amazing how I have improved physically and mentally. I have been very strong mentally, winning matches against Top 50, Top 20 players. I am proud of myself, but of course I want more. My dream is to become No. 1. Of course, now after winning Next Gen, I want to enjoy it this week and relax and celebrate with my family. I want to enjoy the moment and I am very pleased and thankful for this year.‚Äù Fonseca started the season outside the Top 700 in the PIF ATP Rankings but finishes 2024 at No. 145, having demonstrated big-match mentality on home soil in Rio de Janiero in February when he advanced to the quarter-finals at the ATP 500 event. His opening-round win that week against Arthur Fils was his maiden tour-level win. Fonseca‚Äôs winning mindset was in play all week in Jeddah, where he beat top seed Fils and third seed Jakub Mensik in five sets in Blue Group play. He then crucially saved one set point in the final against Tien to avoid falling two sets behind.¬† ‚ÄúI talk with my coach that I like to play big matches in difficult circumstances,‚Äù Fonseca said. ‚ÄúI like playing the big guys. I like when I have a difficult match in a big stadium. I love the pressure. I belong on the stage of tennis where you have to be brave, where you have to go for the shot. I think I have improved a lot.‚Äù Since Sinner (2019) and Alcaraz have gone onto win the event, the Italian and Spaniard have both gone on to win multiple majors and rise to No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings. Fonseca feels he can do the same. ‚ÄúIt is a good pressure,‚Äù said Fonseca, who also won his maiden ATP Challenger Tour title in 2024 (Lexington). ‚ÄúBy winning Next Gen, it shows I am on the right path. I hope I can do the same or even better than what they have done and are doing and are going to do. I look forward to playing with them and I hope I can compete in big matches at Grand Slams. It is where I want to go.‚Äù Learn more about Fonseca Fonseca was supported by lively fans all week at the King Abduallah Sports City. The 18-year-old loved the crowds all week in Jeddah. ‚ÄúIt was amazing all week. Seeing people from other countries cheering for you. People don‚Äôt need to cheer for me but they are,‚Äù Fonseca said. ‚ÄúI am very happy with that. I like to entertain. In important moments I need help from the crowd I try to entertain. It was nice to see Brazilian fans here too. There was a group here all week. It was amazing to see them cheering for me and the country.‚Äù [ATP APP] Fonseca has grown up watching tennis. The Brazilian attended the ATP 500 in Rio de Janeiro when he was younger, often waiting courtside to gain autographs. Now, Fonseca is the one signing his name for fans and inspiring the next generation. ‚ÄúThree years ago I was the one asking for autographs and now kids are asking me and I need to get used to it,‚Äù Fonseca said. ‚ÄúWhen I walk in Rio, sometimes a kid will ask for my autograph and that is crazy. It is very nice that I am inspiring kids to play tennis.‚Äù [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Tennis has crowned its newest star at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, where Joao Fonseca on Sunday completed a perfect week to lift the trophy at the 20-and-under event in Jeddah. The 18-year-old Brazilian rallied past Learner Tien 2-4, 4-3(8), 4-0, 4-2 in the championship match at King Abdullah Sports City to become the second-youngest titlist in event history. By going undefeated across his five matches this week, Fonseca earned a tournament-record $526,480 prize money. \"I was really nervous before the match. I knew it was going to be so difficult,\" Fonseca said before lifting the trophy with former World No. 1 Rafael Nadal watching on from the stands. \"I played a final against Learner in juniors [at the 2023 US Open] and I know the way he can play. He is such a nice guy and a great player, so I knew it was going to be difficult, mentally and physically. But I got my way through.\" JOAO HAS DONE IT üèÜFonseca is the champion in Jeddah ü§©#NextGenATPFinals pic.twitter.com/UCy21lgIQb‚Äî Next Gen ATP Finals (@nextgenfinals) December 22, 2024 Fonseca started the year as No. 730 in the PIF ATP Rankings but will begin 2025 as the World No. 145. He will hope his Jeddah victory can act as a launchpad for a breakthrough season on the ATP Tour in 2025, when he will aim to add to the 12 tour-level wins (including five this week) he earned this year. Although Fonseca had shown glimpses of his potential in 2024, during which he notched his maiden tour-level win against Arthur Fils en route to the quarter-finals on home soil in Rio de Janeiro, he was competing as the lowest seed this week in Jeddah. That status did not stop him from reeling off five impressive wins in Saudi Arabia, including five-set victories against top seed Fils and third seed Jakub Mensik. \"I need to believe when I go to a tournament that I can win,\" Fonseca said. \"But now I have won it I am thinking, 'Wow, I made it'. I am very proud of myself.\" Fonseca was nonetheless made to dig deep to fend off Tien in Sunday‚Äôs final. The American was inspired in the early stages and held a set point to go two-sets-to-love clear at 7/8 in the second-set tie-break. Yet after holding his nerve to level the match, Fonseca increasingly took control with the help of some fierce forehand hitting. He raced through the third set and found a decisive break in the fifth game of the fourth set as Tien was unable to maintain his earlier level. A rock-solid serving display was the key to Fonseca‚Äôs comeback win. He won 83 per cent (34/41) of points behind his first delivery, according to Infosys ATP Stats, while he also triumphed in 68 per cent (15/22) of points on second serves. \"Honestly, I don't know how I did it in the second set,\" Fonseca said. \"I was just trying to keep my game strong on serve. I was not playing my best at the beginning, I was too nervous. But after the second set, I think the third set was another Joao. I was much more aggressive going for the shots and he got a little bit more tight. In the fourth set I just did my best and got the win.\" Fonseca is the third 18-year-old to lift the trophy in seven editions of the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, after current No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF Champions Joao Fonseca 2024 Hamad Medjedovic¬† 2023 Brandon Nakashima 2022 Carlos Alcaraz 2021 Jannik Sinner 2019¬† Stefanos Tsitsipas 2018¬† Hyeon Chung 2017¬† Despite his final defeat, Tien can reflect on a memorable week in Jeddah, where he became the first player in event history to defeat the three top seeds (Fils, Alex Michelsen, Mensik). The 19-year-old American won three ATP Challenger Tour titles in 2024 and will start the new season as the World No. 122. \"I had an amazing year,\" Tien said. \"I had a great week this week. It didn't end the way I wanted but I am proud of myself. I am really happy with the strides I made this year. \"I think I have played some really good tennis this week. I will try and make sure this loss does not take me down a notch. I played some really good tennis and am looking forward to next year.\" Sunday‚Äôs clash was the second Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting of the week between Fonseca and Tien. The Brazilian also prevailed in four sets in the group stage in Jeddah. Their previous meeting before this week was in the boys‚Äô singles final at the 2023 US Open, where Fonseca also lifted the trophy. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
