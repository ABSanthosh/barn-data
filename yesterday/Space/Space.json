    "description": "While faint, the constellation still makes a big impression because of its sheer sizeThis week, we track down one of the zodiacal constellations, Virgo, the virgin. It is a prominent constellation in the northern hemisphere’s spring night sky because of its sheer size. Covering an area of 1,294 square degrees, Virgo is the second largest constellation in the sky. By comparison, the easily recognisable Orion, the hunter, is a celestial minnow at just 594 square degrees.The chart shows the view looking south from London at 22.00 BST on 12 May, although the view will remain roughly the same all week.
