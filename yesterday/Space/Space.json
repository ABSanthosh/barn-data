A lunar eclipse is usually accompanied by a solar eclipse two weeks later, or vice versa, and this month is no exception. On 14 March, the moon was totally eclipsed by Earth; now it is the turn of the sun.There will be no total solar eclipse visible from the surface of Earth, but in certain parts of North America and Greenland up to 90% of its fiery surface may be obscured. For example, in Iqaluit, the capital of Nunavut in Canada, the sun will have 92% of its surface covered. Continue reading...",
