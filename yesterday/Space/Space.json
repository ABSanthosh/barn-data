    "description": "If it is clear, head outside and your patience will be rewarded – with the peak expected on 17 NovemberThe Leonids have a reputation for being a reliable meteor shower with fast, bright meteors that can number up to 15 an hour. The dust grains that we see burning up to form the Leonids have come from the tail of comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle, which can strike our planet’s atmosphere with speeds of up to 70km per second (43.5 miles per second), and leave bright, lingering trails.Roughly every 33 years, the Leonids produce exceptional outbursts called meteor storms, giving observers the chance to witness thousands or more meteors an hour. Such storms were reported in 1833, 1866, 1966, and 1999. Unfortunately, the next storm is not expected until 2032. Continue reading...",
