    "description": "The SpaceX chief’s powerful new system is set to slash the cost of missions, leaving Nasa in the dustIt was one of the most striking technological events of the year. On 13 October, Starship, the world’s largest and most powerful rocket, blasted into space from a launchpad in Texas.
