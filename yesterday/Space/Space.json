    "description": "Prominent constellation in the northern hemisphere’s spring night sky is associated with Canes Venatici, the hunting dogsThis week, we track down another prominent constellation in the northern hemisphere’s spring night sky: Boötes, the herdsman. Listed as part of the 48 constellations described by Ptolemy in the 2nd century, it is now one of the International Astronomical Union’s 88 official constellations.Although known as the herdsman, some stories associated with the constellation depict him as more of a ploughman, driving the constellation of Ursa Major, the great bear, around the pole. In these stories, Ursa Major is changed into an oxen and plough. Continue reading...",

    "description": "While faint, the constellation still makes a big impression because of its sheer sizeThis week, we track down one of the zodiacal constellations, Virgo, the virgin. It is a prominent constellation in the northern hemisphere’s spring night sky because of its sheer size. Covering an area of 1,294 square degrees, Virgo is the second largest constellation in the sky. By comparison, the easily recognisable Orion, the hunter, is a celestial minnow at just 594 square degrees.The chart shows the view looking south from London at 22.00 BST on 12 May, although the view will remain roughly the same all week.
