    "description": "The Sun is 93 million miles away, but its presence is felt strongly even at this distance. One of the more beautiful effects of this presence are the auroras which light up the sky in the Northern and Southern polar regions. These displays, also called the Northern and Southern Lights, are caused by interactions between particles of energy from the Sun and the molecules in the atmosphere above Earth’s poles.",

    "description": "The brilliant planet will move across the invisible line between the pair and appear 3 degrees away from the star AldebaranThis week, Venus will pass through the so-called Golden Gate of the Ecliptic. Although the name has risen to prominence with science popularisers in recent decades, its exact origin is unknown.It references two star clusters in the constellation Taurus, the Bull. The Hydes and the Pleiades lie on either side of the ecliptic, which is the plane of the solar system. As such, the sun, the moon and the planets all follow this line in their passage through the sky. The constellations the ecliptic passes through are known as the zodiacal constellations, referred to in popular culture as the signs of the zodiac. Continue reading...",
