    "description": "Peter Reason says the Booker prize winner’s novel may encourage the idea that we have to get off the planet to see what we are doing to itI was moved by Samantha Harvey’s Booker prize acceptance speech and look forward to reading Orbital (‘I’m so not an astronaut!’ Samantha Harvey on her Booker-winning space novel – and the anxiety that drove it, 13 November). However, it concerns me that her book may encourage the idea that we have to get off the planet in order to recognise, in her words, that “what we do to the Earth, we do to ourselves”. This view was encouraged by the famous photograph Earthrise, and by astronauts like Edgar Mitchell, who thought that seeing the beauty and fragility of Earth from space would bring about a shift in consciousness and a sense of unity and oneness.This shift has quite simply not happened, as evidenced by the accelerating loss of other life forms brought about by human action. To seek a view from outside may stop us from seeing what is before our eyes and in each breath: that every moment we’re part of a living planet.Peter ReasonEmeritus professor, University of Bath Continue reading...",

    "description": "Taken at 28,000km/h and costing billions of dollars, the first ever photos taken by astronauts are on show at Paris Photo. For Nasa print dealer Daniel Blau, they are proof that nothing is impossible when nations collaborateIt was one of history’s monumental moments – but if John Glenn hadn’t popped into the supermarket to pick up a Contax camera and a roll of 35mm film on his way to board the Friendship 7, there may have been no visual document of it. The photographs the American astronaut took from the window of his capsule as he orbited Earth on 20 February 1962 gave an unprecedented testimony of the Mercury Project’s first orbital mission. The Soviet Union might have beaten the Americans in the race to human spaceflight – but the Americans had now shot the first galactic colour photographs.The pictures are also, German gallerist Daniel Blau points out, “the most expensive photographs ever taken. Billions of dollars were spent to get them.” Blau exhibited an original print of Glenn’s first picture taken in space at this year’s Paris Photo, alongside a cache of rare Nasa photographic prints – many of them never publicly seen before, most of them by unknown scientists and astronauts.
