    "description": "Away from street lights, observers can expect to see about 15 to 20 bright and fast meteors an hour The peak of the world’s oldest known meteor showers will grace the skies this week. The Lyrid meteor shower is active from 16-25 April but is at its height on Monday night.The chart shows the view looking east from London at midnight as 21 April becomes 22 April. The radiant (the point on the sky from which the meteors appear to originate, and here labelled Lyrids), is found near the border of Lyra, the lyre, and Hercules, the hero. Conveniently, it is rather near to the bright star Vega. Continue reading...",

Wasn’t there anyone else we could have sent?, 14 April).Le Guin rightly suggests that it is an apparently unremarkable postmenopausal woman who is the ideal candidate to represent humanity on a space mission.
