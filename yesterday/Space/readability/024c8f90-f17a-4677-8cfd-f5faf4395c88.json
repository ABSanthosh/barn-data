The Starliner had so many problems getting to the space station that Nasa ruled it too dangerous to carry anyone and it flew back empty.Their homecoming was further delayed by extra completion time needed for the brand new SpaceX capsule that was supposed to deliver their replacements.Last month, Nasa announced the next crew would launch in a used capsule instead, pushing up liftoff to 12 March. The two crews will spend about a week together aboard the space station before Wilmore and Williams depart with Nasa’s Nick Hague and the Russian Space Agency’s Alexander Gorbunov.Wilmore and Williams – retired Navy captains and repeat space fliers – have insisted over the months that they are healthy and committed to the mission as long as it takes. They took a spacewalk together in January.",
