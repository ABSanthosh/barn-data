This giant star gives out about 400 times more light than the sun and is about 44 times larger in diameter. Roughly 65 light years away, it glows with a distinctly orange colour.Two star clusters can be seen with the naked eye: the Hyades and Pleiades. The Hyades is a V-shaped collection of stars that marks the bull’s head. The Pleiades sits above the bull’s shoulder and is known as the seven sisters.",
