(Image credit: Intuitive Machines) Intuitive Machines may have crashed its latest moon lander on the lunar surface, but that's not keeping the company down for long.The Houston-based company has picked SpaceX to launch IM-4, its fourth moon lander, on a Falcon 9 rocket in 2027 alongside two relay satellites for a NASA lunar communications network. The news comes just weeks after the company's IM-2 moon lander crashed near the moon's south pole, and as the firm continues work on its third moon lander (yes, it's called IM-3), which is expected to launch in 2026.“Lunar surface delivery and data relay satellites are central to our strategy to commercialize the Moon,\" Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said in a statement Tuesday (April 8). \"We plan to deploy the first of five lunar data relay satellites on our third mission, which will introduce our pay-by-the-minute service. The two additional satellites on our fourth mission are intended to scale that service, followed by two additional deployments to complete the constellation and fully support NASA and commercial lunar operations.\" The relay satellites will support NASA’s Near Space Network Services contract, Intuitive Machines wrote.The two legs of Intuitive Machines' private Athena moon lander jut up to the sky, with a half-lit blue Earth above, after the probe fell over during a landing attempt near the lunar south pole on March 6. 2025. (Image credit: Intuitive Machine)Intuitive Machines' IM-4 moon lander will carry six NASA payloads under a contract with the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. A new drill experiment built by the European Space Agency to hunt for water near the moon's south pole, will be aboard.Intuitive Machines' first moon lander, called IM-1 Odysseus, tipped over after breaking a landing leg while attempting to land in 2024. The second lander, the IM-2 Athena, fell on its side during a lunar south pole landing attempt on March 6.The IM-3 moon lander is under construction now.Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!
