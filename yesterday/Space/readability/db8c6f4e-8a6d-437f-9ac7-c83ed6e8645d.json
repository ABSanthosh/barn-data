  "text": "Sally Ride during STS-7, NASA’s seventh Space Shuttle mission, in 1983NASA Sally Cristina Costantini Disney+ (from 17 June) In 1983, Sally Ride made global headlines as the first US woman in space and the third woman after cosmonauts Valentina Tereshkova and Svetlana Savitskaya. A new documentary, Sally, directed by Cristina Costantini, sheds light on her extraordinary life. And it delves beyond the media spectacle to explore the complexities of her private life, including her 27-year-long relationship with Tam O’Shaughnessy, a children’s science writer. Having premiered at this year’s Sundance Film Festival in January, the picture opens with a long sequence composed of archive footage, including Ride’s guest appearance on Sesame Street, a fitting introduction to her role as an icon of empowerment. We can sense how her determination drove her on. “It’s important I don’t do anything dumb,” she says during her appearance on the programme – a statement that encapsulates her striving for perfection, but also the pressure she felt as a woman in highly competitive, male-dominated environments. Ride grew up during the golden era of the US space programme. In 1976, NASA’s decision to diversify its ranks opened the door for women and people from ethnic minority groups. Out of 8000 applicants for the astronaut training programme, 1500 were women – Ride, a PhD candidate in physics, among them. NASA ultimately hired 40 aspiring astronauts. Using a skilful mix of talking heads and remarkably well-crafted staged sequences shot on film – which are so good that they are nearly indistinguishable from the extensive archival footage – the film weaves together Ride’s professional ascent and personal struggles. Fellow astronauts Kathy Sullivan, Judith Resnik and Anna Fisher, along with journalist Lynn Sheer and Ride’s ex-husband, Steve Hawley, offer insights into her character (some feature in that older archival material). For example, Fisher recalls the pressures on female astronauts to downplay their femininity, especially in terms of clothing and make-up. We also meet fellow astronaut Mike Mullane, who is initially portrayed as a hard-line sexist but who ultimately emerges as a man trapped by his own prejudices, later penning a letter expressing profound regret for his past treatment of Ride. His change of heart provides a striking reflection on the professional challenges that she faced along the way. In 1976, NASA’s decision to diversify its ranks opened the door for women and ethnic minority groups Costantini also manages to trace, tenderly and endearingly, Ride’s lifelong bond with O’Shaughnessy, whom she met as a teenager on a sunlit tennis court when they were 13 and 12, respectively. Their relationship remained private for decades, a choice shaped both by Ride’s naturally reserved personality and by the era’s attitudes towards LGBT+ people. The soundtrack, featuring hits such as Lazy Calm by Cocteau Twins, Mr Blue Sky by the Electric Light Orchestra and Neil Young’s Harvest Moon – a song that held deep meaning for Ride and O’Shaughnessy – adds emotional depth to the narrative. The most heartbreaking part of the story starts with Ride’s pancreatic cancer diagnosis in 2011, a battle she fought privately. After delivering a speech at a conference in California, she had noticed how unwell she looked and booked a medical appointment for the following day. A medical ultrasound revealed the presence of a tumour the size of a golf ball in her abdomen. O’Shaughnessy’s testimony, in particular, conveys how their lives were upended in just 24 hours. Nevertheless, the pair managed to lead their lives to the full together until Ride’s last breath. Her legacy endures, not just through her scientific achievements, but also with the Sally Ride Science non-profit organisation, which continues to inspire young women in STEM. All in all, Sally is an illuminating and moving tribute to a woman who defied all expectations in both her career and her personal life. Costantini captures not only the triumphs but also the sacrifices that came with Ride’s pioneering journey, ensuring that her story continues to resonate with new generations.
