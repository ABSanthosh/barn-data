NS-28 will lift off from Launch Site One, the company's West Texas spaceport.NS-28 will carry Calandrelli, Marc Hagle, Sharon Hagle, Austin Litteral, James (J.D.) Russell and Henry (Hank) Wolfond to and from suborbital space.Related: 'The Space Gal' Emily Calandrelli opens up about her coming Blue Origin flight (interview)Calandrelli is an MIT-educated engineer, science communicator and author. \"With the premiere of 'Xploration Outer Space' (2014-present), she became the first American woman to be the sole host of a nationally broadcast science series,\" Blue Origin wrote in today's statement. \"Through her activism, she helped write a bill to improve the TSA's treatment of breastfeeding mothers and started a campaign which improved parental leave in the aerospace industry.\"The Hagles are a married couple who flew together on NS-20 in March 2022. Marc is president and CEO of the property development company Tricor International, and Sharon founded the education nonprofit SpaceKids Global.Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!Litteral is a risk management professional in the finance industry.
