The data reveals a series of features dipping towards the north – something Cardenas said indicated the beach grew out into the ocean. “In fact, it grew at least 1.3km north into the ocean.”Cardenas said the implications were exciting. “It’s a simple structure, but it tells you there had to be tides, there had to be waves, there had to be a nearby river supplying sediment, and all these things had to be active for some extended period of time,” he said.While the researchers noted that tilted features could arise from other types of activity, they say none of these explain the data. “We rule out volcanic, rivers, and wind-blown sand dunes. All of these are pretty commonly seen on Mars, but the structure just doesn’t fit any of them,” said Cardenas.He added that the discovery had implications for understanding the past habitability on Mars. “A beach is an interface between shallow water, air and land. It’s these sorts of environments where it’s thought life first came to be on Earth, and I think it would be a great place to send a follow-up mission looking for signs of past life,” he said.But while the Martian shoreline may have been sandy, the similarities to beaches on Earth are limited: not only would there have been a lack of palm trees and gulls but, Cardenas said, it would probably have been fairly chilly.“That said, I’d love to have seen it. Doing geology, reconstructing these ancient landscapes, it really is excellent daydream fuel,” he said.",
