(Image credit: SpaceX)It was the third static fire for this particular vehicle, which \"is undergoing final preparations for the ninth flight test,\" according to a Tuesday (May 13) SpaceX post on X that shared a video and photos of the trial.The company has not yet announced a target date for Flight 9, but it could happen in the next few weeks. SpaceX has already performed a static fire with the first-stage booster that will launch on the mission.A view at the Flight 9 upper stage's engines during the May 12 static fire. (Image credit: SpaceX)Starship, which stands 403.5 feet (123 meters) tall when fully stacked, is the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built. Both of its elements — the Super Heavy booster and Starship (or just Ship) upper stage — are designed to be fully and rapidly reusable.SpaceX believes that Starship's combination of brawn and reusability will make Mars settlement — a long-held dream of company founder Elon Musk — economically feasible at long last.Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!SpaceX hasn't announced a target launch date for Flight 9 yet. (Image credit: SpaceX)Starship has eight test flights under its belt, two of which have occurred this year.Both of the 2025 flights — which lifted off in January and March, respectively — had similar outcomes. Super Heavy performed well and came back to Starbase for a successful catch by the launch tower's \"chopstick\" arms. But the Ship upper stage had issues on both occasions, exploding less than 10 minutes into flight.Monday's long-duration Ship static fire seemed to go well, but we'll see soon enough if SpaceX has indeed worked out the kinks with the big upper stage.
