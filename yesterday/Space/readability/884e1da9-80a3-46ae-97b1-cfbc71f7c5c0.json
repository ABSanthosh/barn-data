(Image credit: SpaceX)\"Having hundreds of small satellites on orbit is invaluable to the NRO's mission,\" NRO Director Chris Scolese said in a press kit about the proliferated architecture network, which you can find here.\"They will provide greater revisit rates, increased coverage, more timely delivery of information — and ultimately help us deliver more of what our customers need even faster,\" Scolese added.Everything appeared to go well today; the Falcon 9's first stage landed on a drone ship in the Pacific Ocean about eight minutes after launch as planned. It was the 12th launch and touchdown for this particular booster, according to SpaceX.Related: SpaceX launches next-gen US spy satellites on 100th Falcon 9 flight of the year (video, photos)Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!SpaceX ended its livestream today just after booster landing, at the NRO's request; we got no views from the Falcon 9's upper stage or info about the payloads. That's not surprising; the NRO tends to be pretty tight-lipped about its spacecraft and their activities.But the proliferated architecture craft are believed to be modified versions of SpaceX's Starlink internet satellites, with some high-tech spy gear attached.The first proliferated architecture mission launched in May 2024. All 10 of them have flown on Falcon 9 rockets from Vandenberg. Join our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!
