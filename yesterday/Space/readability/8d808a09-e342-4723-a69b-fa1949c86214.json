(Image credit: Cai Studio/The Kennedy Center) A nearly month-long space mission is ready to lift off, with final preparations being made at the Kennedy Center.To be clear, not NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, but rather the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C.\"Earth to Space: Arts Breaking the Sky\" is set to transform the United States' national cultural hub into a launch pad for three weeks of live performances, films, art, interactive exhibits and discussions, all inspired by spaceflight and the wonders of the universe. The festival will see artists paired with astronauts, poets perform with physicists and dancers take the stage with spacecraft designers. EARTH to SPACE Festival @ The Kennedy Center | March 28 - April 20, 2025 - YouTube Watch On \"How do we use space? What are the issues with space? And how does space help us understand more about Earth? Those are the themes we explored as we talked to artists and scientists and traveled about to meet with people to understand as much as we could about this topic,\" said Alicia Adams, vice president for international programming at the Kennedy Center, in an interview with collectSPACE.com.

Kennedy's spaceflight legacy\"Earth to Space\" is the center's third festival as part of a decade-long initiative themed to the arts and nature. After focusing on rivers in 2023 and the forest in 2024, Adams and her co-curator, Gilda Almeida, were motivated by NASA's current focus on returning to the moon and the center's namesake to look beyond the planet for this year's event.\"[President John F.] Kennedy was an inspiration to us because he was the person who initiated the moonshot,\" said Adams. \"There are lots of quotes about what Kennedy thought about space. We do these things 'not because they are easy, but because they are hard,' as he said, and 'it's in our nature to explore,' so we started there.\"Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!The festival, which runs from Friday (March 28) through April 20, blasts off, quite literally, with a one-night-only event. On Saturday (March 29), the sky over the Potomac River will become a giant canvas for large-scale projections and custom fireworks to tell a truly cosmic story.\"Visible from the riverside of the Kennedy Center will be our big, splashy opening,\" Adams said. \"What you will experience will be narrated by artist Cai Guo-Qiang's custom AI model cAI, and it's a love story. That's why it's called 'Interspecies Love Letter.'\"The \"sky painting\" will follow the relationship between Stella, a satellite, and her engineer Ethan on the ground. In the fleeting moments of her \"life\" searching for extraterrestrial intelligence, Stella reaches out from her graveyard orbit to both her love and a new friend with a message connecting them both.\"It is interactive as well. People will be able to use their phones to access a QR code and, at the right time, they will be given a signal to do a certain thing, which will launch fireworks into the sky,\" said Adams.The \"Earth to Space\" festival brings the global Starmus conference to the U.S. for the first time and with it two days of presentations by astronauts, scientists and artists. (Image credit: Starmus/The Kennedy Center)The \"Earth to Space\" sessions then get underway Tuesday (April 1) with a two-day special version of Starmus, the global celebration that unites science, music and art. For its U.S. debut, the conference will feature talks by Apollo 16 moonwalker Charlie Duke, astronaut-turned-artist Nicole Stott, National Academy of Sciences president Marcia McNutt, SETI pioneer Jill Tarter, astrophysicist Garik Israelian and the Kennedy Center's own Youth Ambassador for the Arts and Environment, Aneeshwar Kunchala, among others.There will also be a special dance performance by the Debbie Allen Dance Academy based on a poem written by Allen's mother Vivian Ayers, who was a \"hidden figure\" at NASA.\"In terms of diversity and inclusiveness, what we say to audiences is that it's of real importance to support the artists, to support the art, to support the work that we as curators and the staff of this center have been doing for the last 50 years,\" Adams told collectSPACE. Her reply was in reaction to the recent changes in the center's leadership and the White House's efforts to do away with federally run diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, like the type that Kennedy urged to hire women and minorities to work for the space program.Related: NASA's real 'hidden figures'The River Pavilion at The Reach, part of The Kennedy Center, will become the Moon Rock Club, a space for talks and performances over drinks during the \"Earth to Space\" festival.
