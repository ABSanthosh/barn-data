    "description": "According to The Verge, legacy G Suite accounts will soon lose their individual storage allotment perks and be transitioned to pooled storage, which will be \"shared across all users within your organization.\" The changes will come into effect starting May 1st. From the report: G Suite was rebranded as Workspace in 2020. G Suite legacy free edition, which Google stopped offering in 2012, provides each user with 15GB of free allocated storage and was offered for personal use -- making it ideal for families or groups that need to share a collective domain. Existing users have been permitted to access Workspace services at no additional charge, but Google says it's now making this change because pooled storage provides a \"simpler and more flexible way to manage storage.\" \"Google Workspace customers have had the benefit of pooled storage for years, and now we're rolling it out to users with this legacy offering,\" Google spokesperson Jenny Thomson told The Verge. No action is required for the switch according to Google, and users cannot opt out of the pooled storage transition. The total amount of storage allocated to the entire G Suite account won't be reduced, but if more storage is required then it can be purchased \"at a discount\" starting at increments of 100GB, which typically costs $15. Google hasn't specified how large this discount will be. Storage limitations can still be set for each user within the G Suite account after the transition to prevent the collective storage pool from being hogged by individual users. These limits will have to be manually assigned by an account admin, however. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Roku is testing autoplaying video ads that play before users can access the home screen. While Roku claims this is just an experiment, users are threatening to abandon the platform if the change becomes permanent. Ars Technica reports: Reports of Roku customers seeing video ads automatically play before they could view the OS' home screen started appearing online this week. A Reddit user, for example, posted yesterday: \"I just turned on my Roku and got an unskippable ad for a movie, before I got to the regular Roku home screen.\" Multiple apparent users reported seeing an ad for the movie Moana 2. When reached for comment, a Roku spokesperson shared a company statement that confirms that the autoplaying ads are expected behavior but not a permanent part of Roku OS currently. Instead, Roku claimed, it was just trying the ad capability out. Roku's representative said that Roku's business \"has and will always require continuous testing and innovation across design, navigation, content, and our first-rate advertising products,\" adding: \"Our recent test is just the latest example, as we explore new ways to showcase brands and programming while still providing a delightful and simple user experience.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
