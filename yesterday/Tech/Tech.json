    "description": "This year marks the 125th anniversary of the New York International Auto Show (NYIAS), and despite concerns over tariffs, there are still a lot of manufacturers here showing off new models including a handful of US and global debuts. So without further ado, here are some of the coolest cars on display at the 2025 NYIAS.  The 2026 Subaru Trailseeker First up on the docket is Subaru, which is here today with an early look at its second-ever EV: the Trailseeker. Now I admit that the followup to the Solterra might not be the most exciting announcement, as this model will once again be based the e-TNGA platform, which is shared with Toyota's bZ4x. That said, while the Trailseeker doesn't have the most impressive range (around 260 miles), its updated styling, larger body and improved off-roading capabilities feel more suited to an outdoor lifestyle. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Sam Rutherford for Engadget Sam Rutherford for Engadget The 2026 Kia EV4 Kia has been on a roll when it comes to EVs thanks to existing cars like the EV6 and EV9. At the 2025 NYIAS, the company is looking to keep that momentum rolling with the US debut of the EV4, which incorporates many of the headline features from its previous battery-powered offerings, but with an even more affordable expected starting price of between $35,000 and $40,000. It also features Kia's improved i-PEDAL 3.0 regenerative braking tech which now works even in reverse. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Sam Rutherford for Engadget Sam Rutherford for Engadget Kia EV9 Nightfall edition Speaking of the EV9, while there aren't a ton of updates for 2025, Kia did roll out a new Nightfall edition for its flagship electric SUV. It features blacked-out accents throughout the vehicle including dark wheels, trim and badging. That color scheme even continues inside the vehicle with exclusive all-black upholstery. And when you consider that this remains one of the most affordable three-row electric cars, I think this is a pretty nice way to freshen up the look of the EV9. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Sam Rutherford for Engadget Sam Rutherford for Engadget Genesis X Gran Equator concept Billed as a luxury overlander, the Genesis X Gran Equator concept is easily one of the most striking cars at the 2025 New York Auto Show. It features an extremely long hood and LED light strips that wrap all the way around to the side of the vehicle along with matching tail lights in back. Inside, while it has fancy diamond-stitched upholstery, there are also dedicated holders for resuable waterbottles, which hint at its role as a potential camping vehicle. And while Genesis has not said what kind of powertrain it will have if the X Gran Equator reaches official production, the lack of a distinct grille up front means there's hope it will be an EV. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Sam Rutherford for Engadget Sam Rutherford for Engadget Lucid Gravity While the Gravity was officially announced late last year, it's largely only been available for purchase by friends and family of the company up until now, which has made it a relatively rare site both at trade shows and on the road. But the at NYIAS, it was on display in all of its three-row electric glory. Not only is the Gravity the fastest charging EV outside of China capable of sucking down up to 400 kW, it also boasts a top range of up to 450 miles. Plus, thanks its ability to add 200 miles of range in less than 11 minutes, it pretty much upends the belief that EVs aren't good for longer road trips. And while it's a niche feature, Lucid even created a special cushion that goes in its frunk that instantly converts it into a cozy little love seat. It's the kind of thing that makes me wish drive-in movie theaters weren't so hard to find nowadays.  Sam Rutherford for Engadget Sam Rutherford for Engadget Sam Rutherford for Engadget Hyundai Ioniq 5 N TA spec The TA in the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N TA spec's name stands for time attack. And last year, it did just that when it set the record at Pike's Peak for the electric modified SUV/crossover class with a time of 9 minutes and 32 seconds. But what might be the most impressive thing about the car is that despite some obvious changes to its body (just look at the size of that rear wing), Hyundai says the TA was also built to showcase the strength of the regualar Ioniq 5 N's power electric system. So instead of swapping in some one-off motors, this car has the same basic setup as the standard model (601 hp) with a small boost in output of just 37 horsepower.  Sam Rutherford for Engadget Sam Rutherford for Engadget Sam Rutherford for Engadget Maserati GT2 Stradale Even though we here at Engadget prefer EVs, we'd be remiss not to mention at least one gas-powered car at the New York Auto Show. Announced back in February, the Maserati GT2 Stradale is basically a road-legal version of the GT2 race car, which itself is based on the truly outrageous MC20 supercar. And as you'd expect, it has some pretty impressive specs with a blistering 0-60 time of 2.8 seconds despite it only having rear-wheel drive. It also features a carbon monocoque design just like its track-focused sibling and if you want, you can order one with semi-slick racing tires. So if you've ever had dreams of driving a race car on the street, this might be your ride. That said, Maserati hasn't announced official pricing for the GT2 Stradale. But as the saying goes, if you have to ask, you probably can't afford it.  Sam Rutherford for Engadget Sam Rutherford for Engadget 1924 Chrysler 6 prototype Finally, capping off this list is the Chrysler 6 prototype which made its debut way back at the 1924 New York Auto Show. Granted, this thing is ancient, but at the time it was state-of-the-art boasting the industry's first four-wheel hydraulic brakes along with a six-cylinder engine that produced a whopping 68 horsepower. When it eventually hit the market later that year, the Chrysler 6 cost $1,565. After factoring for inflation, that translates to a sticker price around $29,000, which actually doesn't seem too bad.  Sam Rutherford for Engadget Sam Rutherford for Engadget Sam Rutherford for Engadget This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/the-coolest-cars-at-the-2025-new-york-international-auto-show-144832805.html?src=rss",

    "description": "American Airlines has announced plans to finally offer free Wi-Fi on flights. The company said that its AT\u0026T-sponsored program will start offering free, high-speed Wi-Fi \"across more than 2 million American flights per year\" in January 2026. To be able to access free Wi-Fi you'll have to be a member of American's AAdvantage loyalty program, but once you're signed up, all you'll need to do is log in to access the internet. Wi-Fi will be offered on planes with \"Viasat and Intelsat high-speed satellite connectivity\", according to American, which includes 90 percent of the airline's fleet. \"American is also on pace to outfit more than 500 regional aircraft with high-speed Wi-Fi by the end of 2025,\" the company says. Nearly every major US-based airline offer some kind of free Wi-Fi program, and they're all able to do so thanks to satellite connectivity. United started using Starlink for Wi-Fi earlier this year, and both Hawaiian Airlines and Delta ran tests with SpaceX's satellite internet service back in 2022. Delta ultimately went with Viasat for its T-Mobile-sponsored Wi-Fi program in 2023, with the same loyalty program requirement as American Airlines.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/american-airlines-will-provide-inflight-wi-fi-for-free-starting-next-year-211243870.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Discord has begun testing age verification via facial scans or ID uploads for users in the UK and Australia seeking access to sensitive content. \"The chat app's new process has been described as an 'experiment,' and comes in response to laws passed in those countries that place guardrails on youth access to online platforms,\" reports Gizmodo. From the report: Users may be asked to verify their age when encountering content that has been flagged by Discord's systems as being sensitive in nature, or when they change their settings to enable access to sensitive content. The app will ask users to scan their face through a computer or smartphone webcam; alternatively, they can scan a driver's license or other form of ID. \"We're currently running tests in select regions to age-gate access to certain spaces or user settings,\" a spokesperson for Discord said in a statement. \"The information shared to power the age verification method is only used for the one-time age verification process and is not stored by Discord or our vendor. For Face Scan, the solution our vendor uses operates on-device, which means there is no collection of any biometric information when you scan your face. For ID verification, the scan of your ID is deleted upon verification.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "link": "https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/04/16/1959227/following-layoffs-automattic-employees-discover-leak-catching-watermarks?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon\u0026utm_medium=feed",
    "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from 404 Media: As part of the company's months-long obsession with catching employees leaking internal developments to the press, staff at Wordpress parent company Automattic recently noticed individually-unique watermarks on internal sites, according to employees who spoke to 404 Media. Automattic added the watermarks to an internal employee communications platform called P2. P2 is a WordPress product other workplaces can also use. There are hundreds of P2 sites across teams at Automattic alone; many are team-specific, but some are company-wide for announcements. The watermarks in Automattic's P2 instance are nearly invisible, rendered as a pattern overlaid on the site's white page backgrounds. Zooming in or manually changing the background color reveals the pattern. If, for example, a journalist published a screenshot leaked to them that was taken from P2, Automattic could theoretically identify the employee who shared it. In October, as part of a series of buyout offers meant to test employee's loyalty to his leadership, Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg issued a threat for anyone speaking to the press, saying they should \"exit gracefully, or be fired tomorrow with no severance.\" Earlier this month, the company laid off nearly 300 people. [...] It's not clear when the watermarks started appearing on P2, and Automattic has not responded to a request for comment. But Mullenweg has been warring with web hosting platform WP Engine -- and as the story has developed, seemingly with his own staff -- since last year. [...] One Automattic employee told me they don't think anyone is shocked by the watermarking, considering Mullenweg's ongoing campaign to find leakers, but that it's still adding to the uncertain, demoralized environment at the company. \"Can't help but feel even more paranoid now,\" they said.

Together, the “big three” account for more than 50% of the continent’s cloud market. “Europe has been heavily reliant on US tech and cloud for decades,” said Mark Boost, CEO of UK-based web hosting company Civo. “But there are alternatives, where France, Germany, and the UK have full control of their…This story continues at The Next Web",
