    "description": "PC players of Grand Theft Auto V have at long last reached parity with their console brethren. Following an announcement last month, today Rockstar Games has released a PC update with features that for several years had only been available to the latest console generation. It's a free update for anyone who already owned a copy of the hugely popular game. The original version of GTA V has been delisted from PC storefronts in favor of the new Expanded \u0026 Enhanced iteration of the game, which includes a copy of the old Legacy edition. Both Story Mode and Online progress can be migrated to the most recent version. The update includes technical improvements that debuted on the consoles, as well as some PC-specific ray tracing features if the recommended specs are met. There are also some minor additions on content, such as ambient wildlife, photography challenges, new vehicles and access to the GTA+ subscription service. Rockstar Games has been spiffing up several entries in its GTA franchise over the years. It released a trilogy of remasters for Grand Theft Auto III, GTA: Vice City and GTA: San Andreas in addition to providing these upgrades to GTA V and Grand Theft Auto Online. And while fans of the series might enjoy all the nostalgia, it's safe to say that expectations are sky high for the upcoming Grand Theft Auto VI.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/gta-v-finally-gets-its-next-gen-update-on-pc-three-years-after-consoles-234614209.html?src=rss",

    "description": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has dropped its lawsuit over peer-to-peer payment system Zelle, the latest in a series of dismissals from this department under President Donald Trump's administration. The agency had only just announced the suit ‚Äî filed against Zelle's operating entity Early Warning Services and partner banks JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo ‚Äì in December. According to the initial action, the CFPB said that customers of the three banks had lost more than $870 million during the seven years Zelle has been active. The CFPB made several moves to increase oversight on the financial products offered by tech companies under its previous director, Rohit Chopra. However, the agency is now overseen by Acting Director Russell Vought, who ordered the CFPB to cease all \"supervision and examination activity\" last month. While employees of the bureau have sued to try to keep the CFPB alive, there have been conflicting messages from government leadership about the agency's status. Since taking office, Trump and ally Elon Musk have taken sweeping actions to control and close federal government departments. Agencies that have historically regulated Musk's business activities have been among those with reduced powers, as have federal operations for cybersecurity, digital services and personnel management.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/cfpb-drops-zelle-lawsuit-in-latest-reversal-under-trump-administration-204639032.html?src=rss",
