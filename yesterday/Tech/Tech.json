    "description": "After a more than two-year investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission has sued Elon Musk over his delayed disclosure of the Twitter stock he amassed before announcing his intention to acquire the company in 2022. In a court filing, the SEC says that Musk filed paperwork with the SEC disclosing his purchase of Twitter shares 11 days after an SEC-mandated deadline to do so. (Federal law, as the SEC notes in its statement, requires investors to publicly report when they have acquired a more than 5 percent stake in a company.) This delay, according to the regulator, allowed Musk to buy up even more Twitter stock at a time when other investors were unaware of his involvement with the company. From the lawsuit: During the period that Musk was required to publicly disclose his beneficial ownership but had failed to do so, he spent more than $500 million purchasing additional shares of Twitter common stock. Because Musk failed to timely disclose his beneficial ownership, he was able to make these purchases from the unsuspecting public at artificially low prices, which did not yet reflect the undisclosed material information of Musk‚Äôs beneficial ownership of more than five percent of Twitter common stock and investment purpose. In total, Musk underpaid Twitter investors by more than $150 million for his purchases of Twitter common stock during this period. Investors who sold Twitter common stock during this period did so at artificially low prices and thus suffered substantial economic harm. The regulator has been investigating Musk for years, and has long been at odds with the owner of X. At one point, the SEC accused Musk of attempting to stall and use ‚Äúgamesmanship‚Äù to delay its investigation into his investment in Twitter. Last month, Musk shared a copy of a letter addressed to SEC Chair Gary Gensler in which Musk‚Äôs lawyer, Alex Spiro, accused the regulator of ‚Äúsix years of harassment‚Äù targeting Musk. The letter indicated that Musk refused a settlement offer from the SEC related to its Twitter investigation. Musk also faced a class action lawsuit from other Twitter investors and an FTC probe related to the delayed disclosure. However, as The New York Times notes, it‚Äôs unclear if the SEC‚Äôs latest action will amount to much, as Gensler is expected to step down following the inauguration of President Donald Trump. X didn‚Äôt immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement to The Times, Spiro called the SEC‚Äôs action a ‚Äúa single-count ticky-tack complaint,\" calling it ‚Äúan admission by the S.E.C. that they cannot bring an actual case.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/sec-lawsuit-claims-musk-gained-over-150-million-by-delaying-twitter-stake-disclosure-002627091.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Sonos is continuing to clean house as the company recovers from the hits it took following a disastrous mobile app redesign last year. Just a day after CEO Patrick Spence departed the company, chief product officer Maxime Bouvat-Merlin is also leaving. He will act as an advisor to interim CEO Tom Conrad during the leadership transition before fully exiting Sonos. Conrad informed Sonos employees about the latest leadership change in a company-wide email today. The CPO role is being made redundant, with Sonos' product team reporting directly to Conrad for the time being. Sonos has been in a tailspin since releasing a mobile app update in May that contained many bugs and was missing key features. The company's financial results took a dive, and it laid off about 100 employees in August. Sonos has made several efforts to keep customers aware of its plans to recover from the app launch, and the decision to replace top leadership seems like the latest move to win back public trust in the business.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/sonos-chief-product-officer-is-also-leaving-the-company-223256031.html?src=rss",

    "description": "OpenAI's \"reasoning\" AI model, o1, has exhibited a puzzling behavior of \"thinking\" in Chinese, Persian, or some other language -- \"even when asked a question in English,\" reports TechCrunch. While the exact cause remains unclear, as OpenAI has yet to provide an explanation, AI experts have proposed a few theories. From the report: Several on X, including Hugging Face CEO Clement Delangue, alluded to the fact that reasoning models like o1 are trained on datasets containing a lot of Chinese characters. Ted Xiao, a researcher at Google DeepMind, claimed that companies including OpenAI use third-party Chinese data labeling services, and that o1 switching to Chinese is an example of \"Chinese linguistic influence on reasoning.\" \"[Labs like] OpenAI and Anthropic utilize [third-party] data labeling services for PhD-level reasoning data for science, math, and coding,\" Xiao wrote in a post on X. \"[F]or expert labor availability and cost reasons, many of these data providers are based in China.\" [...] Other experts don't buy the o1 Chinese data labeling hypothesis, however. They point out that o1 is just as likely to switch to Hindi, Thai, or a language other than Chinese while teasing out a solution. Other experts don't buy the o1 Chinese data labeling hypothesis, however. They point out that o1 is just as likely to switch to Hindi, Thai, or a language other than Chinese while teasing out a solution. Rather, these experts say, o1 and other reasoning models might simply be using languages they find most efficient to achieve an objective (or hallucinating). \"The model doesn't know what language is, or that languages are different,\" Matthew Guzdial, an AI researcher and assistant professor at the University of Alberta, told TechCrunch. \"It's all just text to it.\" Tiezhen Wang, a software engineer at AI startup Hugging Face, agrees with Guzdial that reasoning models' language inconsistencies may be explained by associations the models made during training. \"By embracing every linguistic nuance, we expand the model's worldview and allow it to learn from the full spectrum of human knowledge,\" Wang wrote in a post on X. \"For example, I prefer doing math in Chinese because each digit is just one syllable, which makes calculations crisp and efficient. But when it comes to topics like unconscious bias, I automatically switch to English, mainly because that's where I first learned and absorbed those ideas.\" [...] Luca Soldaini, a research scientist at the nonprofit Allen Institute for AI, cautioned that we can't know for certain. \"This type of observation on a deployed AI system is impossible to back up due to how opaque these models are,\" they told TechCrunch. \"It's one of the many cases for why transparency in how AI systems are built is fundamental.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Verge: The Biden administration finalized a new rule that would effectively ban all Chinese vehicles from the US under the auspices of blocking the \"sale or import\" of connected vehicle software from \"countries of concern.\" The rule could have wide-ranging effects on big automakers, like Ford and GM, as well as smaller manufacturers like Polestar -- and even companies that don't produce cars, like Waymo. The rule covers everything that connects a vehicle to the outside world, such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular, and satellite components. It also addresses concerns that technology like cameras, sensors, and onboard computers could be exploited by foreign adversaries to collect sensitive data about US citizens and infrastructure. And it would ban China from testing its self-driving cars on US soil. \"Cars today have cameras, microphones, GPS tracking, and other technologies connected to the internet,\" US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in a statement. \"It doesn't take much imagination to understand how a foreign adversary with access to this information could pose a serious risk to both our national security and the privacy of U.S. citizens. To address these national security concerns, the Commerce Department is taking targeted, proactive steps to keep [People's Republic of China] and Russian-manufactured technologies off American roads.\" The rules for prohibited software go into effect for model year 2027 vehicles, while the ban on hardware from China waits until model year 2030 vehicles. According to Reuters, the rules were updated from the original proposal to exempt vehicles weighing over 10,000 pounds, which would allow companies like BYD to continue to assemble electric buses in California. The Biden administration published a fact sheet with more information about this rule. \"[F]oreign adversary involvement in the supply chains of connected vehicles poses a significant threat in most cars on the road today, granting malign actors unfettered access to these connected systems and the data they collect,\" the White House said. \"As PRC automakers aggressively seek to increase their presence in American and global automotive markets, through this final rule, President Biden is delivering on his commitment to secure critical American supply chains and protect our national security.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
