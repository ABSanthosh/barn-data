    "description": "You'll soon be able to get into your favorite games even faster with the updated Xbox home screen. According to Microsoft, Xbox Insiders are due to get three new customization options later this week that will make their dashboard feel a little more personal. As detailed in Xbox Wire, certain Xbox players will have options to reduce clutter and allow them to pull their favorite games to the front of the list. The first major change lets you pin up to three of your favorite games or apps to the recently-played list. Pinning these means that they'll stay near the front of your list even when you launch other apps occasionally. Beyond that, your Xbox will get the option to \"Hide System Apps\" which should reduce the clutter and tuck those less important shortcuts away. To further streamline your home screen, Xbox will introduce the \"Reduce Tile Count\" feature that lets you set how many visible tiles are in the recently opened games and apps list. With more control thanks to these new features, Xbox players should get a cleaner homepage that lets their dynamic backgrounds shine more. \"We‚Äôve heard from many of you that Home should feel more like your space,\" Eden Marie, principal software engineering lead of Xbox Experiences, wrote on Xbox's blog. \"Whether it‚Äôs surfacing your favorite games, hiding what you don‚Äôt use, or simply making Home feel less crowded, this update is a direct response to that feedback.\" According to Microsoft, these features will arrive on Alpha Skip-Ahead and Alpha users' consoles first. However, the company is still tweaking the Reduce Tile Count feature, adding that it \"will be coming soon.\" Now, if only there were a way to hide those ads on the homescreen.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-will-let-you-pin-up-to-three-favorite-games-to-your-homescreen-200051956.html?src=rss",

    "description": "\"The world has changed,\" writes Stack Overflow's blog. \"Fast. Artificial intelligence is reshaping how we build, learn, and solve problems. Software development looks dramatically different than it did even a few years ago ‚Äî and the pace of change is only accelerating.\" And they believe their brand \"at times\" lost \"fidelity and clarity. It's very much been always added to and not been thought of holistically. So, it's time for our brand to evolve too,\" they write, hoping to articulate a perspective \"forged in the fires of community, powered by collaboration, shaped by AI, and driven by people.\" The developer news site DevClass notes the change happens \"as the number of posts to its site continues a dramatic decline thanks to AI-driven alternatives.\" According to a quick query on the official data explorer, the sum of questions and answers posted in April 2025 was down by over 64 percent from the same month in 2024, and plunged more than 90 percent from April 2020, when traffic was near its peak... Although declining traffic is a sign of Stack Overflow's reduced significance in the developer community, the company's business is not equally affected so far. Stack Exchange is a business owned by investment company Prosus, and the Stack Exchange products include private versions of its site (Stack Overflow for Teams) as well as advertising and recruitment. According to the Prosus financial results, in the six months ended September 2024, Stack Overflow increased its revenue and reduced its losses. The company's search for a new direction though confirms that the fast-disappearing developer engagement with Stack Overflow poses an existential challenge to the organization. DevClass says Stack Overflow's parent company \"is casting about for new ways to provide value (and drive business) in this context...\" The company has already experimented with various new services, via its Labs research department, including an AI Answer Assistant and Question Assistant, as well as a revamped jobs site in association with recruitment site Indeed, Discussions for technical debate, and extensions for GitHub Copilot, Slack, and Visual Studio Code. From the official announcement on Stack Overflow's blog: This rebrand isn't just a fresh coat of paint. It's a realignment with our purpose: to support the builders of the future in an AI world ‚Äî with clarity, speed, and humanity. It's about showing up in a way that reflects who we are today, and where we're headed tomorrow. \"We have appointed an internal steering group and we have engaged with an external expert partner in this area to help bring about the required change,\" notes a post in Stack Exchange's \"meta\" area. This isn't just about a visual update or marketing exercise ‚Äî it's going to bring about a shift in how we present ourselves to the world which you will feel everywhere from the design to the copywriting, so that we can better achieve our goals and shared mission. As the emergence of AI has called into question the role of Stack Overflow and the Stack Exchange Network, one of the desired outputs of the rebrand process is to clarify our place in the world. We've done work toward this already ‚Äî our recent community AMA is an example of this ‚Äî but we want to ensure that this comes across in our brand and identity as well. We want the community to be involved and have a strong voice in the process of renewing and refreshing our brand. Remember, Stack Overflow started with a public discussion about what to name it! And another another post two months ago Stack Exchange is exploring early ideas for expanding beyond the \"single lane\" Q\u0026A highway. Our goal right now is to better understand the problems, opportunities, and needs before deciding on any specific changes... The vision is to potentially enable: - A slower lane, with high-quality durable knowledge that takes time to create and curate, like questions and answers. - A medium lane, for more flexible engagement, with features like Discussions or more flexible Stack Exchanges, where users can explore ideas or share opinions. - A fast lane for quick, real-time interaction, with features like Chat that can bring the community together to discuss topics instantly. With this in mind, we're seeking your feedback on the current state of Chat, what's most important to you, and how you see Chat fitting into the future. In a post in Stack Exchange's \"meta\" area, brand design director David Longworth says the \"tension mentioned between Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange\" is probably the most relevant to the rebranding. But he posted later that \"There's a lot of people behind the scenes on this who care deeply about getting this right! Thank you on behalf of myself and the team.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "An anonymous reader shared this report from CRN: CPU-tracking firm Mercury Research reported on Thursday that Intel's x86 CPU market share grew 0.3 points sequentially to 75.6 percent against AMD's 24.4 percent in the first quarter. However, AMD managed to increase its market share by 3.6 points year over year. These figures only captured the server, laptop and desktop CPU segments. When including IoT and semicustom products, AMD grew its x86 market share sequentially by 1.5 points and year over year by 0.9 points to 27.1 percent against Intel's 72.9 percent... AMD managed to gain ground on Intel in the desktop and server segments sequentially and year over year. But it was in the laptop segment where Intel eked out a sequential share gain, even though rival AMD ended up finishing the first quarter with a higher share of shipments than what it had a year ago... While AMD mostly came out on top in the first quarter, [Mercury Research President Dean] McCarron said ARM's estimated CPU share against x86 products crossed into the double digits for the first time, growing 2.3 points sequentially to 11.9 percent. This was mainly due to a \"surge\" of Nvidia's Grace CPUs for servers and a large increase of Arm CPU shipments for Chromebooks. Meanwhile, PC Gamer reports that ARM's share of the PC processor market \"grew to 13.6% in the first quarter of 2025 from 10.8% in the fourth quarter of 2024.\" And they note the still-only-rumors that an Arm-based chip from AMD will be available as soon next year. [I]f one of the two big players in x86 does release a mainstream Arm chip for the PC, that will very significant. If it comes at about the same time as Nvidia's rumoured Arm chip for the PC, well, momentum really will be building and questioning x86's dominance will be wholly justified.
