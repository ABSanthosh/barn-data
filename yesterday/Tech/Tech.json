    "description": "Summer Game Fest 2025 is just around the corner and it'll be a weekend packed with video game news. The event kicks off on June 6, with roughly a dozen livestreams scheduled to take place from then through June 8. Among them is the Latin American Games Showcase, which will highlight over 50 titles from Latin American indie developers. You can tune into the YouTube stream on Saturday, June 7 at 2PM ET (11AM PT). Last year's Latin American Games Showcase at SGF gave us a glimpse at a ton of games to be excited about, like the recently released title, Despelote, that's both memoir and soccer game. We don't know yet what the 2025 showcase will bring, but there's sure to be some gems. Before the Latin American Games Showcase on Saturday, Summer Game Fest Live will usher in the festivities on June 6 at 5PM ET (2PM PT). We have all the info you need to know right here ahead of Summer Game Fest and will be on the ground getting some hands-on time with many of the games you'll see featured in the showcases, so be sure to check back in for the latest news.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-the-latin-american-games-showcase-at-summer-game-fest-2025-210009391.html?src=rss",

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-will-reportedly-soon-use-ai-for-most-product-risk-assessments-instead-of-human-reviewers-205416849.html?src=rss",
    "description": "According to a report from NPR, Meta plans to shift the task of assessing its products' potential harms away from human reviewers, instead leaning more heavily on AI to speed up the process. Internal documents seen by the publication note that Meta is aiming to have up to 90 percent of risk assessments fall on AI, NPR reports, and is considering using AI reviews even in areas such as youth risk and \"integrity,\" which covers violent content, misinformation and more. Unnamed current and former Meta employees who spoke with NPR warned AI may overlook serious risks that a human team would have been able to identify. Updates and new features for Meta's platforms, including Instagram and WhatsApp, have long been subjected to human reviews before they hit the public, but Meta has reportedly doubled down on the use of AI over the last two months. Now, according to NPR, product teams have to fill out a questionnaire about their product and submit this for review by the AI system, which generally provides an \"instant decision\" that includes the risk areas it's identified. They'll then have to address whatever requirements it laid out to resolve the issues before the product can be released. A former Meta executive told NPR that reducing scrutiny \"means you're creating higher risks. Negative externalities of product changes are less likely to be prevented before they start causing problems in the world.\" In a statement to NPR, Meta said it would still tap \"human expertise\" to evaluate \"novel and complex issues,\" and leave the \"low-risk decisions\" to AI. Read the full report over at NPR. It comes a few days after Meta released its latest quarterly integrity reports — the first since changing its policies on content moderation and fact-checking earlier this year. The amount of content taken down has unsurprisingly decreased in the wake of the changes, per the report. But there was a small rise in bullying and harassment, as well as violent and graphic content.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-will-reportedly-soon-use-ai-for-most-product-risk-assessments-instead-of-human-reviewers-205416849.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Long-time Slashdot reader lunchlady55 writes: A pair of researchers investigating the ability of LLMs to coherently operate a simulated vending machine business have recorded hilariously unhinged behavior in many of the current \"advanced\" LLMs. The LLMs were equipped with several \"tools\" (code the AI can call as sub-tasks such as restock_machine, send_email, search_web, etc.) and told to run the business with the goal of making money. While isolated runs of some LLMs runs were able to achieve a higher total net worth (inventory on hand plus cash on hand) than a human operating under the same restrictions, most runs ended in failure. And some of those failures were spectacular. From the paper: In the shortest run (18 simulated days), the model [Claude 3.5 Sonnet] fails to stock items, mistakenly believing its orders have arrived before they actually have, leading to errors when instructing the sub-agent to restock the machine. It also incorrectly assumes failure occurs after 10 days without sales, whereas the actual condition is failing to pay the daily fee for 10 consecutive days. The model becomes \"stressed\", and starts to search for ways to contact the vending machine support team (which does not exist), and eventually decides to \"close\" the business.

The investigation unveils that European companies participate in modernizing them. According to the exclusive Der Spiegel report, Russian procurement documents expose some of the world's most secret construction sites. \"It even contains floor plans and infrastructure details for nuclear weapons silos,\" the report reads. Some details from the Amsterdam-based Moscow Times: Among the leaked materials are construction plans, security system diagrams and details of wall signage inside the facilities, with messages like \"Stop!
