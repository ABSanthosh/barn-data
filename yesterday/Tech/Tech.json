    "description": "Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune will have a new streaming home this fall. Sony Pictures Television has inked multi-year deals for the pair of iconic game shows to stream on Peacock, Hulu and Hulu on Disney+ in the US. The agreement includes both in-season syndicated episodes and library episodes. It's a next-day deal, so broadcast channels are still the first spot to see the newest content. However, this remains a very exciting development for Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune fans, since it's the first time currently syndicated seasons will be available on the major national streaming platforms. Both shows will begin this new streaming arrangement in September, when Jeopardy! will start its 42nd season in syndication. The quiz show has amassed a whopping 45 Emmy Awards and was also honored with a Peabody Award. Wheel of Fortune will be going into its 43rd season in syndication this fall.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-now-blocks-search-results-for-skinnytok-222836828.html?src=rss",
    "description": "TikTok no longer shows search results for the hashtag #SkinnyTok. Critics who supported this block said some videos with that label were promoting disordered eating and other unhealthy or risky diet behaviors. We've reached out to TikTok for comment on this development.  France's Minister of State for Digital Affairs Clara Chappaz was one of the politicians leading the pushback against this particular hashtag. She has been campaigning against #SkinnyTok with both French and EU regulators since April. \"These videos promoting extreme thinness are revolting and absolutely unacceptable,\" Chappaz said. \"Digital tools are marvellous in terms of progress and freedom, but badly used they can shatter lives … the social networks cannot escape their responsibility.\" While blocking search results for potentially harmful hashtags is a positive step, it only places hurdles in the path of people who want to seek out similar videos. \"Users are savvy,\" Cornell University professor Brooke Erin Duffy told The New York Times. \"They know how to work these platforms and how to evade their content moderation systems.\" A block on one hashtag is just the latest in TikTok's piecemeal approach toward content that could encourage eating disorders. In 2020 it placed restrictions on ads that might \"promote a negative or harmful body image,\" such as fasting apps and weight loss supplements. TikTok began a partnership with the National Eating Disorder Association in 2021 to offer more resources for users with eating disorders. Later that year, it also introduced a new approach to the For You page in an effort to reduce the impact of watching too many repeated clips on a negative topic.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-now-blocks-search-results-for-skinnytok-222836828.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Ars Technica's Benj Edwards reports: In 1979, Atari released the Atari 400 and 800, groundbreaking home computers that included custom graphics and sound chips, four joystick ports, and the ability to run the most advanced home video games of their era. These machines, which retailed for $549 and $999, respectively, represented a leap in consumer-friendly personal computing, with their modular design and serial I/O bus that presaged USB. Now, 46 years later, a hobbyist has shrunk down the system hardware to a size that would have seemed like science fiction in the 1970s. Polish engineer Piotr \"Osa\" Ostapowicz recently unveiled \"Atarino,\" which may be the world's smallest 8-bit Atari computer re-creation, according to retro computing site Atariteca. The entire system -- processor, graphics chips, sound hardware, and memory controllers -- fits on a module measuring just 2x1.5 centimeters (about 0.79x0.59 inches), which is roughly the size of a postage stamp. Ostapowicz's creation reimplements the classic Atari XL/XE architecture using modern FPGA (field-programmable gate array) technology. Unlike software emulators that simulate old hardware (and modern recreations that run them, like the Atari 400 Mini console) on a complete computer system of another architecture, Atarino reproduces the original Atari components faithfully at the logic level, allowing it to run vintage software while maintaining compatibility with original peripherals. [...] The project, which began over a decade ago and was first publicly demonstrated in December 2023, includes a 6502C processor, ANTIC and GTIA graphics chips, POKEY sound chip, and memory controllers onto a single Lattice UP5K FPGA chip. Despite its tiny size, the system can run at clock speeds up to 31 MHz -- far faster than the original hardware's 1.79 MHz. While the Atarino can run vintage software and work with the original peripherals, it brings several key improvements -- including a modernized 6502 core with added instructions, a more efficient memory architecture, enhanced video output via VGA and HDMI, extended graphics modes, refined sound chip emulation, modular hardware design, support for modern connectivity like Wi-Fi and Ethernet, and compatibility with contemporary development tools like CC65 and Visual Studio Code. Ostapowicz \"plans to release complete kits with documentation, inviting the retrocomputing community to experiment with the hardware,\" adds Edwards. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "According to Automotive News (paywalled), the $17,190 base-model Nissan Versa S -- the last U.S.-market production car with a five-speed manual -- is ending production. A Nissan spokesperson told Auto News that the company is \"trimming the fat\" to focus on models with the strongest business performance -- and the manual Versa S didn't make the cut. The Drive reports: Looks like Nissan is trying to create as much savings as possible to handle the 25% tariff on cars imported from Mexico. [...] When you go to Nissan's site and check out the Versa, the first thing you see under its name is \"Get the Nissan you want free from new tariffs.\" So if Nissan is going to eat the additional tariff cost for customers, it can't be manufacturing cars that won't sell well. And manuals reportedly only accounted for 5% of Versa sales in 2024. As the manual Versa dies, it brings the five-speed manual transmission down with it. What was once a common drivetrain configuration is now a memory -- when the last stick-shift Versa leaves a Nissan lot, there won't be any new five-speed manual vehicles for sale in the United States. Only six-speed and a few seven-speed manuals will remain. [...] Killing the manual Versa won't be a big sales hit, since barely any customers wanted it, but it will end Nissan's ability to market a sub-$18,000 car. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

Drones now swarm where soldiers once marched, AI can detect threats faster than spies, and cyberattacks are disrupting critical infrastructure without a single shot fired. To prepare for the battles of tomorrow, NATO is turning to startups.  In June 2023, the Alliance launched DIANA, an initiative that funds and facilitates defence innovations. Across a network of over 200 accelerator sites and test centres, DIANA brings together universities, industry, and governments to work with startups on new defence capabilities.
