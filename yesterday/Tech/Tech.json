    "description": "CD Projekt Red took us by surprise when it dropped a cinematic trailer for The Witcher 4 at The Game Awards, revealing Ciri as the new protagonist. Amidst all the excitement, some observant fans also noticed that Geralt of Rivia‚Äôs adopted daughter seems to sound pretty different than before, and not just in a ‚Äòseveral years have passed‚Äô kind of way. In a statement to TheGamer, CD Projekt Red confirmed that Ciri has been recast. While she was previously voiced by Jo Wyatt, Ciara Berkeley has taken over the role. ‚ÄúCiara Berkeley was cast as Ciri for The Witcher 4 Cinematic Reveal Trailer,‚Äù a spokesperson for CD Projekt Red told TheGamer, and later added that Berkeley voices Ciri in the full game too. ‚ÄúCiara is a talented actress who impressed us with her enthusiasm and vocal acting skills, and in this trailer we believe she truly brought Ciri to life in a way that is both faithful to the character and exciting for fans of the series.‚Äù So there it is. The Game Awards brought a ton of announcements last week in addition to our first look at The Witcher 4.

    "description": "With iOS 18.2 and iPadOS 18.2 now available, iPhone and iPad users have access to a slew of new features that make use of Apple Intelligence. That includes Genmoji, a new type of AI-generated emoji that was first introduced at WWDC 2024. What are Genmoji? Genmoji are custom emojis you can create if you‚Äôve installed the iOS 18.2 or iPadOS 18.2 update. They are the emojis of your imagination, made real with help from Apple Intelligence ‚Äî you describe what emoji you want to see, like a sad cowboy or an octopus DJ, and Apple‚Äôs AI will do its best to generate it. You can even create custom emojis of people you know if you have a photo of them in your library. Once you‚Äôve made Genmoji, they‚Äôll be stored in your keyboard so you can use them in Apple apps that support emojis. They can be sent as part of messages, as standalone stickers or as Tapback reactions. How to create Genmoji To create a Genmoji, you‚Äôll need a device that is up to date with iOS 18.2/iPadOS 18.2 or later and compatible with Apple Intelligence. That includes every iPhone 16 model, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, as well as iPad models with the M1 chip or later, and iPad mini (A17 Pro). At the moment, you can only create Genmoji on iPhone and iPad, though Apple says the feature will be coming to Mac down the line. The steps to create a Genmoji are the same for iPhone and iPad.¬† Apple First, open a conversation and tap the text field to bring up the keyboard. Then tap either the smiley icon or the globe icon, depending on which you have. After doing that, you should now see a multicolored smiley icon with a plus sign on it at the top right of the keyboard. Tap that and a text bar will appear prompting you to describe the emoji you‚Äôd like to create. Enter the description, then tap ‚ÄúDone.‚Äù¬† If you‚Äôre making a Genmoji of a specific person, make sure you‚Äôve already labeled them in your Photos app. Then, enter your description and tap the ‚ÄúChoose a Person‚Äù option above the text field. You‚Äôll be shown who it has identified from your photos, and a few style options as a starting point. Click the one you like, and it'll create the Genmoji using that character. Apple The results might not be to your liking the first try, and if that‚Äôs the case, just try tweaking your description until you get better results. Once you‚Äôve made Genmoji, you‚Äôll be able to find them in your keyboard either by swiping right through all the emoji options or by tapping the sticker icon. You can also add them to Tapback by pressing and holding a message, and clicking the smiley with a plus sign icon to search the emoji keyboard. How to delete Genmoji If you made a Genmoji and later decide you aren‚Äôt into it anymore, you can always delete it after the fact. To do this, head back into the emoji keyboard and either swipe right through all the pages or just tap the sticker icon. From there, find the Genmoji you want to get rid of, press and hold it, then tap Remove once the option pops up.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/how-to-use-genmoji-to-make-your-own-custom-emojis-225907928.html?src=rss",

    "description": "They provide training data to top AI companies including OpenAI and Meta, according to its web site. Founded in 2016, San Francisco-based Scale AI now has over 900 employees, eventually growing beyond \"unicorn\" status with over $1.35 billion in ivnestments. In May the company's valuation was over $14 billion, with investors including Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, Cisco, Intel, and AMD (as well as earlier investments from Y Combinator and $100 million from Peter Thiel's Founders Fund). SFGate calls them \"a buzzy San Francisco startup with high-dollar ties across the tech industry\". But SFGate also report Scale AI \"was sued Tuesday by a former worker with allegations that the company is committing wage theft and misclassifying workers.\" Steve McKinney filed the suit against Scale and several top executives, including 27-year-old billionaire CEO Alexandr Wang, in San Francisco Superior Court. With the filing, the former contractor aims to be a lead plaintiff for a class-action lawsuit against Scale; a judge will need to certify his proposed class of current and former contractors within California... McKinney, whose complaint says he was paid on an hourly basis and worked on a project eventually sold to Meta, is accusing Scale of amassing its clout and cash by exploiting workers. \"Scale AI is the sordid underbelly propping up the generative AI industry,\" the complaint says, before rattling off a list of allegations about its treatment of contractors. The document accuses Scale of bait-and-switch hiring promises; demanding off-the-clock, unpaid work; denying overtime pay; and unfairly booting contractors from projects... The Tuesday complaint calls Scale's control over its contractors \"Orwellian.\" The company makes contractors download a tool to track much of their computer use, including by taking periodic screenshots, the suit alleges. The lawsuit also alleges that Scale reassigns the workers to varyingly paid projects and docks pay if a task takes more than it was supposed to, plus posits that Scale is in violation of California's \"ABC\" test, which monitors use of the designation \"independent contractor.\" It argues that contracted \"Taskers\" like McKinney should be classified as employees instead... The complaint, along with arguing for class-action certification, seeks restitution, punitive damages and changes to Scale's worker classification model. The article adds that \"Per Fortune, Scale's armies of contractors marked up images for Cruise and Waymo to help autonomous cars understand their surroundings...\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Saturday night two men were arrested near Boston \"following a hazardous drone operation near Logan Airport's airspace,\" according to a police statement. They credit an officer \"leveraging advanced UAS monitoring technology\" who \"identified the drone's location, altitude, flight history, and the operators' position.\" Recognizing the serious risks posed by the drone's proximity to Logan's airspace, additional resources were mobilized. The Boston Police Department coordinated with Homeland Security, the Massachusetts State Police, the Joint Terrorism Task Force, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and Logan Airport Air Traffic Control to address the situation. \"Both suspects face charges of trespassing, with additional fines or charges potentially forthcoming.\" Meanwhile on Friday night \"Officials at Stewart International Airport, located roughly 60 miles north of New York City, said they shut down their runways for an hour,\" reports ABC News, after America's Federal Aviation Administration \"alerted them that a drone was spotted in the area around 9:30 p.m.\" Though officials say flight operations weren't impacted during the closure, the article notes that New York's governor is now calling for federal assistance, including more federal law enforcement officers, saying \"This has gone too far.\" [Governor Hochul] called on Congress to pass the Counter-UAS Authority Security, Safety, and Reauthorization Act, which would strengthen the FAA's oversight of drones and give more authority to state and local law enforcement agencies to investigate the activity. The article explores the larger problem of Americans reporting drone sightings: Officials from a wide range of federal agencies spoke with reporters Saturday on a phone call and emphasized that the federal investigation into drone sightings in New Jersey is ongoing. One FBI official said that out of the nearly 5,000 tips they have received, less than 100 have generated credible leads for further investigation. A Department of Homeland Security official said that they are \"confident that many of the reported drone sightings are, in fact, manned aircraft being misidentified as drones.\" The FBI official also talked about how investigators overlaid the locations of the reported drone sightings and found that \"the density of reported sightings matches the approach pattern\" of the New York area's busy airports including Newark-Liberty, JFK, and LaGuardia. But, an FAA official says that there have \"without a doubt\" been drones flying over New Jersey, pointing to the fact that there are nearly a million drones registered in the U.S. \"With nearly a million registered [unmanned aircraft systems] in the United States, there's no doubt many of them are owned and operated here within the state,\" the FAA official said... A Joint Chiefs of Staff official said that there have been visual sightings of drones reported by \"highly trained security personnel\" near Picatinny Arsenal and Naval Weapons Station Earle in New Jersey. The official said that they do not believe the sightings \"were aligned with a foreign actor, or that they had malicious intent.\" \"We don't know what activity is. We don't know if it is criminal, but I will tell you that it is irresponsible,\" the official said. \"Here on the military side, we are just as frustrated with the irresponsible nature of this activity.\" Later ABC News reported that the FAA had imposed temporary drone flight restrictions in New Jersey over the Picatinny Arsenal military base. And they added that America's Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas \"said the federal government is taking action to address the aerial drones that have prompted concern among New Jersey residents. \"I want to assure the American public that we in the federal government have deployed additional resources, personnel, technology to assist the New Jersey State Police in addressing the drone sightings....\" There have been numerous reports of drone activity along the East Coast since November. Mayorkas cited the 2023 change of a Federal Aviation Administration rule that allows drones to fly at night as to why there might be an uptick in sightings. \"I want to assure the American public that we are on it,\" he said, before calling on Congress to expand local and state authority to help address the issue. \"It is critical, as we all have said for a number of years, that we need from Congress additional authorities to address the drone situation,\" Mayorkas said. \"Our authorities currently are limited and they are set to expire. We need them extended and expanded... We want state and local authorities to also have the ability to counter growing activity under federal supervision,\" he added, echoing sentiments from local officials... Addressing national security concerns the sightings have prompted, Mayorkas said the U.S. knows of no foreign involvement and that it remains \"vigilant\" in investigating the drone sightings. [ABC News anchor George] Stephanopoulos pressed Mayorkas about past security threats drones have caused, including the arrest of a Chinese national last week who allegedly flew a drone over an Air Force base in California. \"When a drone is flown over restricted airspace, we act very, very swiftly,\" the homeland security secretary said. \"In fact, when an individual in California flew a drone over restricted airspace, that individual was identified, apprehended and is being charged by federal authorities.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "link": "https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech/episodes/1009",
    "description": "Leo Laporte, Harry McCracken, Christina Warren, and Lou Maresca discuss the evolving relationship between the tech industry and the incoming Trump administration, the future of TikTok in the U.S., advances in AI and its impact on everything from weather forecasting to web browsing, and much more. ‚Ä¢ Elon Musk and other tech billionaires are playing a major role in shaping President-elect Trump's transition team. The panel debated what this could mean for issues like antitrust regulation of Big Tech. ‚Ä¢ Trump has named entrepreneur and investor David Sacks as the White House AI and Crypto Czar. Sacks is an Elon Musk ally who has been critical of OpenAI. ‚Ä¢ The Hak Tuah cryptocurrency project suffered a 90% price crash shortly after launch amid controversy, in what may have been a \"rug pull\" scam. ‚Ä¢ Trump's pick to lead NASA, private astronaut Jared Isaacman, is expected to push the agency to partner more with SpaceX and the commercial space industry. But his close ties to Elon Musk could face political hurdles. ‚Ä¢ TikTok's future remains murky as U.S courts uphold a potential ban. The crew discusses the free speech implications and the role of geopolitics. EU also probes TikTok over Russian election interference. ‚Ä¢ Entrepreneur Frank McCourt's Project Liberty consortium is reportedly advancing a bid to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations, positioning it as a \"people's bid.\" ‚Ä¢ The U.S. House is set to approve an additional $3 billion to fund the removal of Chinese telecom equipment like Huawei and ZTE from domestic networks. ‚Ä¢ Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is departing after a challenging 3-year stint. The chip giant's future strategy is up in the air as it faces intensifying competition, but the chip company did outline breakthroughs at a conference in advanced transistors, packaging, and interconnects that could help it regain a manufacturing edge. ‚Ä¢ OpenAI is running a \"12 Days of OpenAI\" promotion highlighting new AI models and services. The TWiT panel debated whether it's mainly a technical showcase or a monetization push. ‚Ä¢ Google unveiled a weather forecasting AI model that it says outperforms the leading U.S. and European forecast systems, especially for predicting extreme events. ‚Ä¢ ElevenLabs launched a beta product that allows users to create and edit entire AI-generated podcast episodes, sparking discussions about the impact on human podcast creators. ‚Ä¢ With the rise of AI, could we see a new generation of AI-infused web browsers that better understand our behavior? A long blog post by tech guru Om Malik explored the possibilities. ‚Ä¢ In the wake of China's \"Salt Typhoon\" hacks of telecom networks, the FCC is proposing new cybersecurity rules - but with a twist that would allow law enforcement backdoor access. ‚Ä¢ In the latest twist in the CSAM scanning saga, Apple is being sued for abandoning the controversial child abuse image detection feature, after previously being pilloried for trying to implement it. ‚Ä¢ A sleeker, more accurate definition of a \"second\" based on atomic clocks using Strontium instead of Cesium atoms could be coming by 2030, enabling new scientific breakthroughs. ‚Ä¢ Just in time for Christmas, a pair of the iconic ruby slippers from The Wizard of Oz sold at auction for a whopping $28 million, a new record for movie memorabilia.

    "description": "In this week's episode of This Week in Tech, Leo Laporte and guests Devindra Hardawar, Doc Rock, and Jennifer Pattison Tuohy discuss a wide range of topics including Australia's ban on social media for under 16s, the latest in smart home technology and Matter protocol, CES 2024 expectations, Black Friday sales records, Elon Musk's legal battles, the FTC's efforts to protect consumers, and the growing threat of infrastructure sabotage. The panel also touches on the lifespan of smart devices, the ownership of social media accounts, and the growth of Bluesky. Australia bans social media for everyone under 16, sparking a discussion on the challenges of age verification, the necessity of such measures, and the potential impact on children's social lives Jennifer shares her thoughts on the progress and challenges of Matter protocol, the future of smart home technology, and the killer use cases like energy management that could drive broader adoption Devindra looks forward to checking out the latest tech at CES 2024, while the panel discusses the impact of potential tariffs on consumer electronics prices Black Friday online sales hit a record $74.4B, up 5% from last year, with over half of spending done on mobile devices and a surge in traffic to retail sites from AI chatbots Elon Musk files for an injunction to halt OpenAI's transition to a for-profit, accusing the company of discouraging investors from backing rivals like his own xAI Musk admits X is throttling links, effectively limiting people from reading news on the platform, which could impact content creators and marketers The panel discusses the implications of X's objection to The Onion buying InfoWars, reminding users that they do not own their social media accounts or followers As alternative social media platforms like Bluesky gain traction, the panel considers the challenges of managing multiple platforms and the potential for a more decentralized social media landscape The FTC releases a report on the hidden lifespan of smart devices, highlighting the need for transparency and the potential security risks of unsupported devices FTC changes its telemarketing rules to better protect consumers from growing 'tech support scam' calls Supreme Court considers whether ISPs should be liable for users' piracy, with potential far-reaching consequences Concerns rise over infrastructure sabotage as a Chinese ship's crew is suspected of deliberately dragging an anchor for 100 miles to cut Baltic cables Meta plans to build a $10B subsea cable spanning the world to support its services and ensure data traffic flow Host: Leo Laporte Guests: Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, Doc Rock, and Devindra Hardawar Download or subscribe to This Week in Tech at https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech Get episodes ad-free with Club TWiT at https://twit.tv/clubtwit Sponsors: NetSuite.com/TWIT bitwarden.com/twit e-e.com/twit INFO.ACILEARNING.COM/TWIT - code TWIT100",
