    "description": "Apple is being sued by victims of child sexual abuse over its failure to follow through with plans to scan iCloud for child sexual abuse materials (CSAM), The New York Times reports. In 2021, Apple announced it was working on a tool to detect CSAM that would flag images showing such abuse and notify the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. But the company was hit with immediate backlash over the privacy implications of the technology, and ultimately abandoned the plan. The lawsuit, which was filed on Saturday in Northern California, is seeking damages upwards of $1.2 billion dollars for a potential group of 2,680 victims, according to NYT. It claims that, after Apple showed off its planned child safety tools, the company ‚Äúfailed to implement those designs or take any measures to detect and limit‚Äù CSAM on its devices, leading to the victims‚Äô harm as the images continued to circulate.¬† In a statement shared with Engadget, Apple spokesperson Fred Sainz said, ‚ÄúChild sexual abuse material is abhorrent and we are committed to fighting the ways predators put children at risk. We are urgently and actively innovating to combat these crimes without compromising the security and privacy of all our users. Features like Communication Safety, for example, warn children when they receive or attempt to send content that contains nudity to help break the chain of coercion that leads to child sexual abuse. We remain deeply focused on building protections that help prevent the spread of CSAM before it starts.‚Äù¬† The lawsuit comes just a few months after Apple was accused of underreporting CSAM by the UK‚Äôs National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC). Update, December 8 2024, 6:55PM ET: This story has been updated to include Apple's statement to Engadget.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-sued-for-failing-to-implement-tools-that-would-detect-csam-in-icloud-202940984.html?src=rss",

    "description": "As spotted by a Reddit user this weekend, Panic is now selling a macaroni yellow charging brick to go with the yellow cable that comes with the distinctively yellow Playdate. Say yellow again. The good news for anyone who wants a complete set of matching accessories is that it‚Äôs only $5 ‚Äî the bad news is that shipping costs almost double that at its cheapest, so it‚Äôs kind of hard to justify buying on its own. Also note that the 10W power adapter has a USB-A connection so it‚Äôll work with your existing Playdate charging cable, but it‚Äôs otherwise kind of behind the times considering the general shift toward the USB-C connection. At the moment, Panic is only selling a version that‚Äôs compatible with the 2-prong plug type that‚Äôs standard in North America and Japan. It goes without saying that absolutely no one needs this ‚Äî our Playdates have been charging just fine without it so far ‚Äî but if you‚Äôre already on the site getting a pizza case now that they‚Äôre back in stock, then sure, go wild.

    "description": "Google's app store claims that their text-messaging app Google Messages means \"conversations are end-to-end encrypted\". \"That is some serious bullshit,\" argues tech blogger John Gruber: It's shamefully misleading regarding Google Messages's support for end-to-end encryption... Google Messages does support end-to-end encryption, but only over RCS and only if all participants in the chat are using a recent version of Google Messages. But the second screenshot in the Play Store listing flatly declares \"Conversations are end-to-end encrypted\", full stop... I realize that \"Some conversations are end-to-end encrypted\" will naturally spur curiosity regarding which conversations are encrypted and which aren't, but that's the truth. And users of the app should be aware of that. \"RCS conversations with other Google Messages users are encrypted\" would work. Then, in the \"report card\" section of the listing, it states the following: Data is encrypted in transit Your data is transferred over a secure connection Which, again, is only true sometimes. It's downright fraudulent to describe Google Messages's transit security this way.... [D]epending who you communicate with ‚Äî iPhone users, Android users with old devices, Android users who use other text messaging apps ‚Äî it's quite likely most of your messages won't be secure... E2EE is never available for SMS, and never available if a participant in the chat is using any RCS client (on Android or Apple Messages) other than Google Messages. That's an essential distinction that should be made clear, not obfuscated. Gruber's earlier blog post had pointed out that the RCS standard \"has no encryption; E2EE RCS chats in Google Messages use Google's proprietary extension and are exclusive to the Google Messages app, so RCS chats between Google Messages and other apps, most conspicuously Apple Messages, are not encrypted.\" And in his newer post, Gruber adds, \"While I'm at it, it's also embarrassing that Google Voice has no support for RCS at all. It's Google's own app and service, and Google has been the world's most vocal proponent of RCS messaging.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "This week a Florida-based Bitcoin-tech company named MARA Holdings announced it had bought a 114-megawatt Texas wind farm, reports Chron.com, \"and will subsequently take it off the power grid and use it to energize its mining operations.\" MARA's CEO tells the site they're \"leveraging renewable resources that would have otherwise been curtailed\" while \"reducing our bitcoin production costs through vertical integration, and demonstrating MARA's commitment to environmental stewardship.\" The wind farms were not a part of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid, but instead they were located within the Southwest Power Pool, which manages the market for the central U.S., including but not limited to most or parts of Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota and North Dakota... A 114-MW facility could power somewhere between 20,000 and 100,000 homes, depending on who you ask... Historically, the facilities use up a lot of power and have generated backlash from neighbors who have complained about the noise of the machines inside. Texas has been a haven for cryptocurrency tech companies, primarily because of the state's space, deregulated power market and friendly business climate. Two weeks ago, the Public Utilities Commission adopted a rule requiring crypto and other virtual currency miners within the ERCOT grid to register their locations, ownership information and electricity demands, to further ensure that they could be watchful of this emerging source of energy consumption. \"Crypto mining operations currently consume around 2.3 percent of US electricity, and it requires roughly 155,000kWh to mine one Bitcoin,\" notes the site Data Centre Dynamics. This is the second off-grid power deal MARA has signed over the last few months. In October, it launched a 25MW micro data center operation across oil wellheads in Texas and North Dakota. The data center will be powered exclusively by excess natural gas from oilfield production that would have otherwise been flared. The operation will be distributed across wellheads in Texas and North Dakota, with operational status expected by January 2025. Some context from Bloomberg: A few years ago Bitcoin miners took part in a global scramble for electricity to power their specialized computers... But the rise of AI, with its insatiable demand for electricity, dwarfed the needs of crypto and upended energy markets worldwide. Miners must now compete with much-larger tech firms for connections to electrical grids and power contracts. \"Bitcoin miners are being forced to go look at marginal generation,\" said [MARA CEO Fred] Thiel. \"The AI guys can afford to pay a much higher amount for energy than a Bitcoin miner\"... MARA's plan to mine only when the wind is blowing makes economic sense because its mine will house last-generation computers that would otherwise have been retired, Thiel said. \"Thiel said he'd be interested to potentially buy more wind farms over time.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Scientists in the UK have successfully created the world‚Äôs first carbon-14 diamond battery, which could power low-energy devices like satellite communication equipment for over 5,000 years. The battery is made of the radioactive isotope carbon-14, encased in a thin layer of synthetic diamond. As the carbon-14 decays it emits electrons. The diamond acts like a semiconductor, converting these electrons into electricity. Since carbon-14 has a half-life of 5,700 years, scientists expect the battery to last for millennia.¬† The UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) and the University of Bristol led the development, partly due to the former‚Äôs work on fusion energy.‚Ä¶This story continues at The Next Web",
