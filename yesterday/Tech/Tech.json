    "description": "OpenAI is keeping up its rapid-fire pace of new AI releases. The company introduced the o3 and o4-mini models to its ChatGPT platform in April. At the time, the business promised that a pro model of the o3 was on the way, and that version became available today. Both the o3 and o4-mini models are meant to use and combine all the tools under ChatGPT's umbrella. When OpenAI adds the \"pro\" designation to a model, it's a version that has been built to spend longer answering queries to provide better and more accurate responses. \"We recommend using it for challenging questions where reliability matters more than speed, and waiting a few minutes is worth the tradeoff,\" the company said in the release notes for the o3-pro. In the testing assessments shared, the o3-pro delivered better benchmarks than the o3 and the o1-pro options. There are some restrictions on the other ChatGPT services the o3-pro can use. Image generation and Canvas are not supported, so users will need to turn to different models for those features. The o3-pro is available today for ChatGPT Pro and Team users, while Enterprise and Edu customers will have access to this option next week.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-adds-the-o3-pro-model-to-chatgpt-today-212126136.html?src=rss",

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/razer-launches-its-first-barebones-mechanical-keyboard-205043334.html?src=rss",
    "description": "On Tuesday, Razer launched its first keyboard for the DIY set. As its name implies, the BlackWidow V4 75% Barebones is the popular mechanical keyboard, only without keys and keycaps. It could be a solid option if you like Razer's design and Chroma RGB but want to bring your own keys. Otherwise, the Barebones BlackWidow is identical to the fully assembled variant. It still supports 3-pin or 5-pin mechanical switches and custom keycaps. It offers a polling rate of up to 8,000Hz with Razer's HyperPolling tech. Razer Other details include factory-lubricated stabilizers for smoother keystrokes and dual-layer dampening foam. It even has pre-applied tape to soften higher frequencies. For a full rundown of the keyboard's feature set, Engadget's Igor Bonifacic reviewed it for IGN in 2023. At $140, the black barebones version is $60 cheaper than the pre-assembled version. The white variant is slightly less thrifty at $150. (Unfortunately, you can't get a barebones one in phantom green.) You can order the BlackWidow V4 75% Barebones today on Razer's website.

    "description": "\"Twelve years ago, a baby was born after someone used bitcoin to pay for a frozen egg IVF,\" writes longtime Slashdot reader bobdevine. \"I, for one, welcome...\" Blockworks tells the story of how it all came to be: In February 2012 -- almost two years after Laszlo's pizzas -- a fertility doctor named C. Terence Lee set about a personal and professional quest to onboard his patients to Bitcoin by accepting BTC for his services. He started with a \"Bitcoin accepted here\" sign in his window, and then a Reddit post. \"Jumping in to do my part to support the BTC economy. This may be a historic first?\" Lee wrote in a post on the BitMarket subreddit, titled: \"[WTS][USA] Male Fertility Evaluation.\" Lee was offering a 15-minute consultation to discuss fertility questions and a sperm analysis in exchange for 15 BTC, valued at $70 or so at the time. \"Actual value over $100,\" he wrote. Within three months, he'd found a Bitcoin customer. \"The patient turned out not... so much having a burning desire to know about his fertility, but he was a Bitcoin enthusiast, and he liked the idea of participating in history, in this ritual ceremony of what could be perhaps the world's first Bitcoin medical transaction,\" Lee explained at a 2013 conference in San Jose. \"So we chatted about Bitcoin. He taught me a lot about mining. That's how he acquired bitcoin. And we did a sperm test, and it turned out he had really good sperm ... after it was done he sent me 15 bitcoins... \" Lee changed up his strategy to only quiz his most trusted patients. There was one couple, who, on their fourth attempt at IVF, agreed to pay in bitcoin for a 50% discount, with Lee walking them through exchanging U.S. dollars for bitcoin via CryptoXChange, a now-defunct exchange operating out of Australia. The sperm stuck, leading CNN to reveal, on this day in 2013, \"the world's first Bitcoin baby\" -- a baby bought entirely with bitcoin. Thirty bitcoin to be exact, an amount then worth $500, or $3 million today. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "\"It is true, Google AI is stomping on the entire internet,\" writes Slashdot reader TheWho79, sharing a report from the Wall Street Journal. \"From HuffPost to the Atlantic, publishers prepare to pivot or shut the doors. ... Even highly regarded old school bullet-proof publications like Washington Post are getting hit hard.\" From the report: Traffic from organic search to HuffPost's desktop and mobile websites fell by just over half in the past three years, and by nearly that much at the Washington Post, according to digital market data firm Similarweb. Business Insider cut about 21% of its staff last month, a move CEO Barbara Peng said was aimed at helping the publication \"endure extreme traffic drops outside of our control.\" Organic search traffic to its websites declined by 55% between April 2022 and April 2025, according to data from Similarweb. At a companywide meeting earlier this year, Nicholas Thompson, chief executive of the Atlantic, said the publication should assume traffic from Google would drop toward zero and the company needed to evolve its business model. [...] \"Google is shifting from being a search engine to an answer engine,\" Thompson said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. \"We have to develop new strategies.\" The rapid development of click-free answers in search \"is a serious threat to journalism that should not be underestimated,\" said William Lewis, the Washington Post's publisher and chief executive. Lewis is former CEO of the Journal's publisher, Dow Jones. The Washington Post is \"moving with urgency\" to connect with previously overlooked audiences and pursue new revenue sources and prepare for a \"post-search era,\" he said. At the New York Times, the share of traffic coming from organic search to the paper's desktop and mobile websites slid to 36.5% in April 2025 from almost 44% three years earlier, according to Similarweb. The Wall Street Journal's traffic from organic search was up in April compared with three years prior, Similarweb data show, though as a share of overall traffic it declined to 24% from 29%.
