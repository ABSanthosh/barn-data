    "description": "Viktor Antonov, best known for his work as art lead on Half-Life 2 and Dishonored, has reportedly died at age 52. Half-Life writer Marc Laidlaw broke the news in an Instagram Story, and other former colleagues have since taken to social media to pay tribute as well. “I didn’t want to say much till I felt it was confirmed, but I learned today that Viktor Antonov, our visionary art lead on HL2, has died,” Laidla wrote in the now-expired post, which was reshared by LambdaGeneration on Saturday night. Antonov got his start in video games working on Redneck Rampage, and in addition to serving as art director for Half-Life 2 and Dishonored, he went on to consult on titles including Doom (2016) and Fallout 4. The Bulgarian artist just recently appeared in a documentary celebrating the 20th anniversary of Half-life 2 this past November. “RIP Viktor Antonov. I wish I told you how much admiration I had for you but we get caught in our lives until a surprise like this hits us,” Raphael Colantonio, founder of Arkane Studios and Wolfeye Studios, wrote on Bluesky. “You were instrumental to the success of Arkane Studios and an inspiration to many of us, also a friend with whom I have many fond memories.” In another post, game designer Harvey Smith added, “All this about his impact and talent is true, but I will also always remember how much he made me laugh, with his dry, devastating wit. RIP.”This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/viktor-antonov-art-director-for-half-life-2-and-dishonored-has-died-according-to-colleagues-203219167.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Apple Vision Pro may soon get an update bringing Apple Intelligence to the headset, according to a new report from Bloomberg. The first Apple Intelligence features started rolling out to iPhone, iPad and Mac in the fall, bringing features like notification summaries, ChatGPT integration for Siri and Genmoji over the last few months. But Apple’s AI hasn’t yet made it to the Vision Pro. According to Mark Gurman, that may change with the visionOS 2.4 update, which sources said may arrive in April with Apple Intelligence and a new app for viewing spatial media like 3D images and panoramas. The first Apple Intelligence features to come to Vision Pro will reportedly include Writing Tools, Genmoji and Image Playground. Gurman reports that developers may get access to these features in beta “as soon as this week.” Don’t expect any major changes to Siri on Vision Pro just yet, though. According to Gurman, a “major AI overhaul” the company had been planning for the assistant has been delayed.

    "description": "Nicholas Carr wrote The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains. But his new book looks at how social media and digital communication technologies \"are changing us individually and collectively,\" writes the Los Angeles Review of Books. The book's title? Superbloom: How Technologies of Connection Tear Us Apart . But if these systems are indeed tearing us apart, the reasons are neither obvious nor simple. Carr suggests that this isn't really about the evil behavior of our tech overlords but about how we have \"been telling ourselves lies about communication — and about ourselves.... Well before the net came along,\" says Carr, \"[the] evidence was telling us that flooding the public square with more information from more sources was not going to open people's minds or engender more thoughtful discussions. It wasn't even going to make people better informed....\" At root, we're the problem. Our minds don't simply distill useful knowledge from a mass of raw data. They use shortcuts, rules of thumb, heuristic hacks — which is how we were able to think fast enough to survive on the savage savanna. We pay heed, for example, to what we experience most often. \"Repetition is, in the human mind, a proxy for facticity,\" says Carr. \"What's true is what comes out of the machine most often....\" Reality can't compete with the internet's steady diet of novelty and shallow, ephemeral rewards. The ease of the user interface, congenial even to babies, creates no opportunity for what writer Antón Barba-Kay calls \"disciplined acculturation.\" Not only are these technologies designed to leverage our foibles, but we are also changed by them, as Carr points out: \"We adapt to technology's contours as we adapt to the land's and the climate's.\" As a result, by designing technology, we redesign ourselves. \"In engineering what we pay attention to, [social media] engineers [...] how we talk, how we see other people, how we experience the world,\" Carr writes. We become dislocated, abstracted: the self must itself be curated in memeable form. \"Looking at screens made me think in screens,\" writes poet Annelyse Gelman. \"Looking at pixels made me think in pixels....\" That's not to say that we can't have better laws and regulations, checks and balances. One suggestion is to restore friction into these systems. One might, for instance, make it harder to unreflectively spread lies by imposing small transactional costs, as has been proposed to ease the pathologies of automated market trading. An option Carr doesn't mention is to require companies to perform safety studies on their products, as we demand of pharmaceutical companies. Such measures have already been proposed for AI. But Carr doubts that increasing friction will make much difference. And placing more controls on social media platforms raises free speech concerns... We can't change or constrain the tech, says Carr, but we can change ourselves. We can choose to reject the hyperreal for the material. We can follow Samuel Johnson's refutation of immaterialism by \"kicking the stone,\" reminding ourselves of what is real. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "\"A robotic lander from Texas-based Firefly Aerospace is now in orbit around the Moon,\" reports Spaceflight Now, \"and going through its final preparations to land in the coming weeks.\" Its arrival comes nearly a month after the spacecraft launched onboard a Falcon 9 rocket from pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center. This is the third mission launched as part of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, an initiative designed to bring science and technology demonstrations to the Moon at a cheaper cost... Manifested on this lander are 10 NASA payloads, which cover a range of objectives. Those include the Lunar Instrumentation for Subsurface Thermal Exploration with Rapidity (LISTER) instrument, which will drill between 2- to 3-meters into the Moon's surface to study the heat flow; and the Stereo Cameras for Lunar Plume-Surface Studies (SCALPSS) 1.1 instrument, which will use a series of cameras to capture the plume generated at landing to help create a three-dimensional model... \"We saw that for the type of advanced scientific or engineering measurements we wanted to make, the instruments were small enough and compact enough that we could actually fly 10,\" [said Joel Kearns, deputy associate administrator for Exploration in NASA's Science Mission Directorate], \"if someone could actually schedule them to get all of their operations done over the 14 Earth day lunar daytime.\" Firefly Aerospace ended up winning that bid and carries with it the most NASA instruments manifested on a single Commercial Lunar Payload Services lander so far. Friday on X.com Firefly Aerospace wished a happy Valentine's Day to \"all those on Earth who dare to Dream Big.\" \"Blue Ghost has been capturing stunning imagery of our planet throughout its journey,\" Spaceflight Now says in a 12-minute video. And Friday on X.com Firefly posted Blue Ghost's first spectacular shots of the moon as it approaches — along with its special message for Valentine's Day. \"I love you to the Moon, but not back — I'm staying there.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
