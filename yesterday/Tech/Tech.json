    "description": "Sonos is embarking on a restructuring plan that will eliminate about 200 positions at the company. Interim CEO Tom Conrad announced the news in a call with the team, then shared the news in a public statement. Conrad said the company is \"reorganizing our Product organization into functional groups for Hardware, Software, Design, Quality and Operations, and away from dedicated business units devoted to individual product categories. With this simpler organization in place, cross-functional project teams will come together to improve our core experience and deliver new products.\" Sonos has been taking a beating financially and in the public eye after the launching a poorly received app redesign last year. The company already laid off 100 employees in August. Since then, CEO Patrick Spence and Chief Product Officer Maxime Bouvat-Merlin have also departed, and the company has altered some of its product release plans. Yesterday, rumors circulated that a new streaming box could be coming from Sonos in the coming months.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/sonos-will-cut-about-200-jobs-in-restructuring-233809885.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Over the past several weeks, Warner Bros. Entertainment has been uploading a selection of full movies to a playlist on YouTube. It's an odd move, considering parent Warner Bros. Discovery also owns the increasingly pricey streaming service Max. But free is free, so the company can be odd as much as it wants! It'd be easy to assume this is where the studio is putting its less prestigious back catalog, just to see if it can rake in some ad revenue from an unexpected source. And there is some impressively terrible stuff in the playlist, including a 1988 Bobcat Goldthwait vehicle that achieved the rare 0 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. But this isn't just a digital dumping ground for bad movies. Quality films such as Waiting for Guffman (from the hilarious Christopher Guest), The Science of Sleep (directed by Michel Gondry) and The Mission (starring Robert DeNiro and Jeremy Irons) are all currently available in full on the YouTube playlist. It's tough to gauge exactly why Warner Bros. would be taking this route, or how the company is selecting movies to release. Maybe it's a response to business debts. Maybe it's a licensing issue. Whatever the reason, the TL;DR is that there are some fascinating movies you can stream for free, and new titles are being added every week.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/warner-bros-is-sharing-select-movies-for-free-on-youtube-230005326.html?src=rss",

    "description": "During the fourth quarter of 2024, AMD surpassed Intel in datacenter sales for the first time in history -- despite weaker-than-expected sales of its datacenter GPUs. Tom's Hardware reports: AMD's revenue in Q4 2024 totaled $7.658 billion, up 24% year-over-year. The company's gross margin hit 51%, whereas net income was $482 million. On the year basis, 2024 was AMD's best year ever as the company's revenue reached $25.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year. The company earned net income of $1.641 billion as its gross margin hit 49%. But while the company's annual results are impressive, there is something about Q4 results that AMD should be proud of. Datacenter business was the company's primary source of earnings, with net revenue reaching record $3.86 billion in Q4, marking a 69% year-over-year (YoY) increase and a 9% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) rise. Operating income also saw substantial improvement, surging 74% YoY to $1.16 billion. By contrast, Intel's datacenter and AI business unit posted $3.4 billion revenue, while its operating income reached $200 million. But while the quarter marked a milestone for AMD, market analysts expected AMD to sell more of its Instinct MI300-series GPUs for AI and HPC. You can view AMD's 2024 financial results here.

    "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from the Associated Press: The website of the Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek, whose chatbot became the most downloaded app in the United States, has computer code that could send some user login information to a Chinese state-owned telecommunications company that has been barred from operating in the United States, security researchers say. The web login page of DeepSeek's chatbot contains heavily obfuscated computer script that when deciphered shows connections to computer infrastructure owned by China Mobile, a state-owned telecommunications company. The code appears to be part of the account creation and user login process for DeepSeek. In its privacy policy, DeepSeek acknowledged storing data on servers inside the People's Republic of China. But its chatbot appears more directly tied to the Chinese state than previously known through the link revealed by researchers to China Mobile. The U.S. has claimed there are close ties between China Mobile and the Chinese military as justification for placing limited sanctions on the company. [...] The code linking DeepSeek to one of China's leading mobile phone providers was first discovered by Feroot Security, a Canadian cybersecurity company, which shared its findings with The Associated Press. The AP took Feroot's findings to a second set of computer experts, who independently confirmed that China Mobile code is present. Neither Feroot nor the other researchers observed data transferred to China Mobile when testing logins in North America, but they could not rule out that data for some users was being transferred to the Chinese telecom. The analysis only applies to the web version of DeepSeek. They did not analyze the mobile version, which remains one of the most downloaded pieces of software on both the Apple and the Google app stores. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission unanimously denied China Mobile authority to operate in the United States in 2019, citing \"substantial\" national security concerns about links between the company and the Chinese state. In 2021, the Biden administration also issued sanctions limiting the ability of Americans to invest in China Mobile after the Pentagon linked it to the Chinese military. \"It's mindboggling that we are unknowingly allowing China to survey Americans and we're doing nothing about it,\" said Ivan Tsarynny, CEO of Feroot. \"It's hard to believe that something like this was accidental. There are so many unusual things to this. You know that saying 'Where there's smoke, there's fire'? In this instance, there's a lot of smoke,\" Tsarynny said.

    "description": "The potential of using artificial intelligence in drug discovery and development has sparked both excitement and skepticism among scientists, investors and the general public. “Artificial intelligence is taking over drug development,” claim some companies and researchers. Over the past few years, interest in using AI to design drugs and optimise clinical trials has driven a surge in research and investment. AI-driven platforms like AlphaFold, which won the 2024 Nobel Prize for its ability to predict the structure of proteins and design new ones, showcase AI’s potential to accelerate drug development.
