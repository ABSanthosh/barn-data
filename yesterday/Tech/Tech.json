    "description": "Steam announced this week that it will offer a compatibility rating that will designate when a game is supported on the company's operating system. The SteamOS Compatibility assessment is slated to roll out \"in the next few weeks.\" This metric is an extension of the Steam Deck Verified program, and it will award a checkmark to games based on a data subset within that vetting process. In other words, game developers won't have to take any additional steps if they're already completing Steam Deck Verified. On the player end, compatible games will show a blue checkmark when viewed in the Steam Store and Steam Client while running the operating system on a device other than the Steam Deck. The announcement is mostly a future-proofing move. Right now, the Lenovo Legion Go S is the only handheld besides the Steam Deck that's officially running Valve's operating system. But Lenovo was already teasing a second iteration of the hardware at CES this year and Valve clearly has plans for the number of SteamOS platforms to grow. The landscape for handheld gaming could start looking quite different if SteamOS really takes off as a standalone service.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/valve-made-a-steam-deck-verified-program-for-things-that-arent-steam-decks-224535134.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Buried in the blog posts and videos that accompanied Google's The Android Show: I/O Edition announcements was a nugget of Nothing news: The Nothing Phone 3 is going to be expensive. In an Android marketing video showcasing the company's phones, Nothing CEO Carl Pei shared that the new phone will cost around £800 when it launches this summer. That new cost is thanks to Nothing's decision to go \"all-in\" on the new device by including \"premium materials, major performance upgrades and software that really levels things up,\" according to Pei. The Nothing Phone 2 launched at £580 in the UK and $600 in the US, so selling the Phone 3 at £800 is a noticeable price jump. Assuming Nothing follows through on the premium upgrades it's promising, though, maybe it'll make sense that the Phone 3 costs as much as a Pixel 9 or iPhone 16. Nothing made its name on affordable phones that have unique, premium designs. For example, the company launched the Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro in March 2025, the budget and mid-range counterparts to the Phone 3. Both phones use mid-range chips and camera sensors, but feature a futuristic design and clever AI features that you'd expect out of a much more expensive device. Switching to trying to compete with Apple and Samsung in terms of price suggests Nothing is confident, at the very least. We'll have to wait until this summer when the Phone 3 is actually released to see if that confidence is justified.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/carl-pei-teases-the-all-in-nothing-phone-3-with-a-flagship-price-213023983.html?src=rss",

    "link": "https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/05/13/2234225/qatars-400-million-jet-for-trump-is-a-gold-plated-security-nightmare?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon\u0026utm_medium=feed",
    "description": "Qatar is gifting Trump a $400 million luxury 747 to serve as a temporary Air Force One, but experts warn that retrofitting it to meet presidential security standards could take years, cost hundreds of millions more, and risk national security due to potential embedded surveillance. The Register's Iain Thomson reports: The current VC-25s aren't just repainted 747s. They're a pair of flying fortresses that must be capable of allowing the president to run the country, survive wartime conditions (even nuclear), and be totally secure from outside influence or intrusion. While the precise details of the current airframe are a tightly guarded secret, some details are included on government fact sheets or have been revealed in various media reports. For a start, it must have an in-flight refueling capability so the president can go anywhere in the world and stay up as long as needed. Retrofitting this to an existing 747 would be very expensive, as the feds would need to strengthen portions of the hull to handle the refueling system and reconfigure the fuel tanks to handle trim issues. Then there's the hull, which is known to be armored, and the windows are also thicker than you'd find on a normal flight. The government would also need to build in weapons systems like the chaff rockets used against radar-guided missiles, flares against heat seekers, and AN/ALQ-204 Matador Infrared Countermeasure systems, or similar to try and confuse incoming missiles. Next up, the engines and electrical systems would have to be replaced. The electronics in the current VC-25s are hardened as much as possible against an electromagnetic pulse that would be generated by a nuclear detonation. There are also claims that the aircraft have extra shielding in the engines to help against missile fragments should a physical attack happen. Next up are communications. Air Force One has air-to-ground, air-to-air, and satellite comms systems that are thought to be the equal of what's in the White House. There are at least two separate internal phone systems - one open and the other highly secure - that would need to be installed and checked as well. Then there are incidentals. Contrary to what films will tell you, there is no escape capsule on the current Air Force One, nor a rear parachute ramp, but there is a medical suite with emergency equipment and space for a physician which would already need to be installed, as well as a secured cargo area designed to prevent tampering or unauthorized access. As for the threat of embedded surveillance devices, Richard Aboulafia, managing director of aircraft consultancy AeroDynamic Advisory, said: \"You'd have to take it apart piece by piece to stop a professional operator putting in lots of equipment to confuse things, like spare sensors and wiring.\" \"It wouldn't be in the air before 2030 at the earliest, long after he's left office and probably later than the existing planned replacements,\" said Aboulafia. \"It makes no sense on any level, except that he wants a free 747 for himself. Nothing else makes any sense.\" \"What's sort of annoying about the whole thing is I'm not sure what's wrong with the current Air Force One,\" Aboulafia said. \"Maybe if they gave it a gold makeover, he'd like it more.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "According to Rest of the World, a major confrontation between Meta and the local authorities in Nigeria is currently taking place: \"Local authorities have fined Meta $290 million for regulatory breaches, prompting the social media giant to threaten pulling Facebook and Instagram from the country.\" Techdirt reports: As with earlier EU fines imposed on the company, the sticking point is Meta's refusal to comply with local privacy laws [...]. The fine itself is small change for Meta, which had a net income of $62 billion on a turnover of $165 billion in 2024, and a market capitalization of $1.5 trillion. Meta's current revenues in Nigeria are relatively small, but its market shares are high: \"According to social media performance tracker Napoleoncat, Meta has a massive presence in the country, with Facebook alone reaching about 51.2 million users as of May 2024, more than a fifth of the population. Instagram had 12.6 million Nigerian users as of November 2023, while WhatsApp had about 51 million users, making Nigeria the 10th largest market globally for the messaging app.\" Since many Nigerians depend on Meta's platforms, the company might be hoping that there will be public pressure on the government not to impose the fine in order to avoid a shutdown of its services there. But it is hard to see Meta carrying out its threat to walk away from a country expected to be the third most populous nation in the world by 2050. In 2100, the population of Nigeria could reach 541 million according to current projections. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
