    "description": "Nintendo added an absolute gem to its Switch Online library of classic titles this week: the 1994 Game Boy game, Donkey Kong. The beloved game arrives alongside the 1995 puzzle game, Mario‚Äôs Picross. Both are available now for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers, right in time for Mario Day (March 10). Donkey Kong built upon the arcade game that came before it, and features roughly 100 stages. The story should feel pretty familiar even to those who don‚Äôt have a nostalgic connection to it ‚Äî Donkey Kong has kidnapped a beautiful woman (Pauline) and Mario is in hot pursuit to rescue her. While the Super Game Boy brought some enhancements for the original game, those haven‚Äôt been carried over for Nintendo Switch. But it should still be a treat to revisit as is. Mario‚Äôs Picross offers a totally different experience, presenting the player with a couple hundred puzzles to solve by chiseling away at boxes and uncovering the secret image below.

    "description": "Employees of the General Services Administration, which manages government real estate and certain IT efforts, have been given a custom chatbot from Elon Musk‚Äôs DOGE to help automate tasks, according to a new report from Wired, with an internal memo telling workers it can be used to ‚Äúdraft emails, create talking points, summarize text, write code.‚Äù The chatbot, GSAi, gives users a choice of three models ‚Äî Claude Haiku 3.5 (the default), Claude Sonnet 3.5 v2 and Meta Llama 3.2 ‚Äî and is ultimately meant to be used to ‚Äúanalyze contract and procurement data,‚Äù Wired reports. The GSA is one of the many agencies that have been affected by the federal government‚Äôs mass job cuts, and has so far let go upwards of 1,000 workers, sources told NPR in a report published this week. That includes roughly 90 people from its tech branch, according to Wired. In memos about the new chatbot seen by Wired, workers were told not to input ‚Äúfederal nonpublic information,‚Äù personally identifiable information or ‚Äúcontrolled unclassified information.‚Äù It was reportedly tested among a smaller group last month before rolling out to the roughly 1,500 workers who now have access, with plans to expand down the line.

    "description": "This week the Free Software Foundation \"backed a lone developer's brave effort to overturn a pivotal court ruling that threatens to undermine the AGPLv3 ‚Äî the foundation's GNU Affero General Public License, version 3,\" reports the Register. \"At stake is the future of not just the AGPLv3, but the FSF's widely used GNU Public License it is largely based on, and the software covered by those agreements.\" A core tenet of the GPL series is that free software remains free forever, and this is woven into the licenses' fine print. This ongoing legal battle is a matter of whether people can alter those licenses and redistribute code as they see fit in a non-free way, or if they must stick to the terms of an agreement that says the terms cannot be changed... If the Ninth Circuit upholds the [original district court] ruling, it's likely to create a binding precedent that would limit one of the major freedoms that AGPLv3 and other GPL licenses aim to protect ‚Äî the ability to remove restrictions added to GPL licensed code. \"Neo4j appended an additional nonfree commercial restriction, the Commons Clause, to a verbatim version of the GNU AGPLv3 in a version of its software...\" according to an FSF announcement this week. \"The FSF's position on such confusing licensing practices has always been clear: the GNU licenses explicitly allow users to remove restrictions incompatible with the four freedoms.\" (You can read their amicus brief here.)

    "description": "Axiom Space and Red Hat will collaborate to launch Data Center Unit-1 (AxDCU-1) to the International Space Station this spring. It's a small data processing prototype (powered by lightweight, edge-optimized Red Hat Device Edge) that will demonstrate initial Orbital Data Center (ODC) capabilities. \"It all sounds rather grand for something that resembles a glorified shoebox,\" reports the Register. Axiom Space said: \"The prototype will test applications in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning (AI/ML), data fusion and space cybersecurity.\" Space is an ideal environment for edge devices. Connectivity to datacenters on Earth is severely constrained, so the more processing that can be done before data is transmitted to a terrestrial receiving station, the better. Tony James, chief architect, Science and Space at Red Hat, said: \"Off-planet data processing is the next frontier, and edge computing is a crucial component. With Red Hat Device Edge and in collaboration with Axiom Space, Earth-based mission partners will have the capabilities necessary to make real-time decisions in space with greater reliability and consistency....\" The Red Hat Device Edge software used by Axiom's device combines Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the Red Hat Ansible Platform, and MicroShift, a lightweight Kubernetes container orchestration service derived from Red Hat OpenShift. The plan is for Axiom Space to host hybrid cloud applications and cloud-native workloads on-orbit. Jason Aspiotis, global director of in-space data and security, Axiom Space, told The Register that the hardware itself is a commercial off-the-shelf unit designed for operation in harsh environments... \"AxDCU-1 will have the ability to be controlled and utilized either via ground-to-space or space-to-space communications links. Our current plans are to maintain this device on the ISS. We plan to utilize this asset for at least two years.\" The article notes that HPE has also \"sent up a succession of Spaceborne computers ‚Äî commercial, off-the-shelf supercomputers ‚Äî over the years to test storage, recovery, and operational potential on long-duration missions.\" (They apparently use Red Hat Enterprise Linux.) \"At the other end of the scale, the European Space Agency has run Raspberry Pi computers on the ISS for years as part of the AstroPi educational outreach program.\" Axiom Space says their Orbital Data Center is deigned to \"reduce delays traditionally associated with orbital data processing and analysis.\" By utilizing Earth-independent cloud storage and edge processing infrastructure, Axiom Space ODCs will enable data to be processed closer to its source, spacecraft or satellites, bypassing the need for terrestrial-based data centers. This architecture alleviates reliance on costly, slow, intermittent or contested network connections, creating more secure and quicker decision-making in space. The goal is to allow Axiom Space and its partners to have access to real-time processing capabilities, laying the foundation for increased reliability and improved space cybersecurity with extensive applications. Use cases for ODCs include but are not limited to supporting Earth observation satellites with in-space and lower latency data storage and processing, AI/ML training on-orbit, multi-factor authentication and cyber intrusion detection and response, supervised autonomy, in-situ space weather analytics and off-planet backup \u0026 disaster recovery for critical infrastructure on Earth.
