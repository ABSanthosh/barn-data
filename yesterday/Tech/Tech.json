    "description": "Hollywood has been turning to video games for source material quite a bit in recent years. And while their success rate has been improving (mostly), it's a surprise to see a a movie adaptation announced before the game that inspired it has even been released. Clair Obsur: Expedition 33 clearly made a big impression on somebody important, because it will be turned into a live action movie from Story Kitchen. The fantasy RPG was part of Microsoft's summer showcase in August and was highlighted during last week's Xbox Developer Direct. It's slated for release on April 24.  \"We’re thrilled to collaborate with Sandfall Interactive to bring the rich, immersive world of Expedition 33 to the big screen,” Story Kitchen founders Dmitri M. Johnson and Mike Goldberg told Variety. \"The game’s compelling narrative and complex characters provide a solid foundation for a cinematic experience that will resonate with both gamers and moviegoers alike.\" Story Kitchen has been assembling quite the lineup of video games to translate to the big and small screens. The outfit, which was previously called dj2 Entertainment, has been attached to a movie of It Takes Two, a Tomb Raider TV series, a film of Lovecraftian fishing sim Dredge, an animated series inspired by Vampire Survivors and a Sifu movie. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/clair-obscur-expedition-33-secures-a-movie-adaptation-before-its-even-released-000443246.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Yet another streaming service is raising its prices. This time, it's Amazon Music Unlimited that's getting more expensive. Prime members will pay $11 a month or $109 a year for an individual plan, up from $10 and $99, respectively. Listeners who aren't part of Prime will see their monthly rates change from $11 to $12 for the individual plan. The family plan is also seeing increased prices, from $17 to $20 per month and from $169 to $199 for a year. The new pricing structure took effect for new customer sign-ups on January 29. Current subscribers will be charged the updated rates in their next billing cycle on or after March 5. The FAQ detailing the increased costs states that the change will bring listeners \"more content and features,\" which was the same rationale given when Amazon Music Unlimited previously raised its fees in 2023. The service has added the ability to borrow Audible audiobooks and a personalized year-in-review since then, which is nice, but possibly not as nice as paying less each month.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/amazon-music-unlimited-subscription-prices-are-rising-again-232426667.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Italy's data protection agency has blocked the Chinese AI chatbot DeekSeek after its developers failed to disclose how it collects user data or whether it is stored on Chinese servers. Reuters reports: DeepSeek could not be accessed on Wednesday in Apple or Google app stores in Italy, the day after the authority, known also as the Garante, requested information on its use of personal data. In particular, it wanted to know what personal data is collected, from which sources, for what purposes, on what legal basis and whether it is stored in China. The authority's decision -- aimed at protecting Italian users' data -- came after the Chinese companies that supply chatbot service to DeepSeek provided information that \"was considered to totally insufficient,\" the authority said in a note on its website. The Garante added that the decision had \"immediate effect\" and that it had also opened an investigation. Thanks to new submitter axettone for sharing the news.

    "description": "Apple reported a record-breaking first quarter of 2025 with $124.3 billion in revenue and $36.3 billion in profit, or $2.40 per diluted share, driven by strong growth in its services business. That's \"compared to revenue of $119.6 billion and net quarterly profit of $33.9 billion, or $2.18 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter,\" notes MacRumors. From the report: Apple set all-time records during the quarter for total revenue, earnings per share, and services revenue. Total revenue was up 4 percent year-over-year, while earnings per share rose by 10 percent. Services, Mac, and iPad revenue figures were all up significantly year-over-year, while iPhone and Wearables saw small declines. Gross margin for the quarter was 46.9 percent, compared to 45.9 percent in the year-ago quarter. Apple also declared a quarterly dividend payment of $0.25 per share, payable on February 13 to shareholders of record as of February 10. \"Today Apple is reporting our best quarter ever, with revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4 percent from a year ago,\" said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. \"We were thrilled to bring customers our best-ever lineup of products and services during the holiday season. Through the power of Apple silicon, we're unlocking new possibilities for our users with Apple Intelligence, which makes apps and experiences even better and more personal. And we're excited that Apple Intelligence will be available in even more languages this April.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "In 1981, American physicist and Nobel Laureate, Richard Feynman, gave a lecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) near Boston, in which he outlined a revolutionary idea.

In the 40-plus years since, it has become an intensive area of research in computer science. Despite years of frantic development, physicists have not yet built practical quantum computers that are well suited for everyday use and normal conditions (for example, many quantum computers operate at very low temperatures).

That fundamental building block of many programming languages ​​​​translates the more human-understandable code into something a computer understands.
