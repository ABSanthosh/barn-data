    "description": "Sonos Black Friday sales are here, kicking off one of the few times of the year you can actually save a decent amount on the company‚Äôs speakers, soundbars and other gear. This time around, you can get up to $200 off, with one of the highlights being $50 off the Sonos Era 100 ‚Äî it‚Äôs down to a record low of $199. If you‚Äôre in the market for a soundbar, consider the Sonos Arc. Now that the Arc Ultra is available, Sonos has discounted its previous flagship soundbar by $200 to $699. For something more affordable, the Beam 2 is currently $369, down from $499. Lastly, there‚Äôs the Era 300. Right now, you can buy the Dolby Atmos-compatible speaker for $359, instead of $449 as usually priced. All of these deals are being matched by Amazon, too. More than a few of Sonos‚Äô speakers, including the Era 100, have found a spot and stayed on Engadget‚Äôs list of best smart speakers. If you care about music but still want a speaker with modern features, a Sonos system is the way to go. Not only do the company‚Äôs speakers sound great, but you also get access to things like AirPlay 2 that make it incredibly easy to play exactly the song you want to listen to in the moment. You may have seen that Sonos bungled the release of the latest version of its companion app. That‚Äôs true, but as things stand, the company has done a lot of work in recent months to fix its software. As a daily user, I can safely say the Sonos app is in much better shape now than it was in the spring. Other than the premium price that comes with Sonos products, there‚Äôs not much they don‚Äôt do as well or better than the competition. With the discounts the company is offering for Black Friday, its speakers come even more highly recommended.

    "description": "There are a bunch of deals on consoles and video games for Black Friday. But even if you buy physical copies, current-gen consoles require that games be fully installed onto internal storage to minimize loading times. If you have a lot of games, you may want to have extra storage space. As such, Xbox Series X/S owners may wish to consider picking up Seagate's storage expansion card. The 2TB variant is on sale at the moment. It has dropped to a near-record low of $200 for Black Friday. That's 46 percent off the regular price. Seagate's version is one of our picks for the best Xbox Series X/S accessories. The 2TB version should give you ample space ‚Äî at least until you start filling it up with all of the huge Call of Duty games that have started hitting Game Pass. Let's face it, proprietary storage stinks, but the choice for Series X/S owners looking for more space is largely between Seagate's Storage Expansion Card and WD's Black C50. It's possible to store Series X/S games on a regular external drive, but you'll need to move them to internal storage or an expansion card anyway to actually play them. If you don't want to deal with shifting large files around and waiting for transfers to complete, or you don't want to delete and download games more than is necessary, an expansion card is the way to go. Check out all of the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals here.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/xbox-black-friday-deal-get-the-seagate-2tb-expansion-card-for-200-180119041.html?src=rss",

    "description": "British members of parliament have voted to legalize assisted dying, approving a contentious proposal that would make the United Kingdom one of a small handful of nations to allow terminally ill people to end their lives. From a report: Lawmakers in the House of Commons voted by 330 to 275 to support the bill, after an hours-long debate in the chamber and a years-long campaign by high-profile figures that drew on emotional first-hand testimony. Britain is now set to join a small club of nations to have legalized the process, and one of the largest by population to allow it. The bill must still clear the House of Lords and parliamentary committees, but Friday's vote marked the most important hurdle. It allows people with a terminal condition and less than six months to live to take a substance to end their lives, as long as they are capable of making the decision themselves. Two doctors, and then a High Court judge, would need to sign off on the choice. Canada, New Zealand, Spain and most of Australia allow assisted dying in some form, as do several US states including Oregon, Washington and California. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
