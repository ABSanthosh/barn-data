    "description": "Google is making Gemini just a bit better. Starting today, the company's chatbot will recall past conversations in an effort to provide more useful responses. \"That means no more starting over from scratch or having to search for a previous conversation thread,\" Google explains. \"Plus, you can build on top of previous conversations or projects you’ve already started.\"  Google notes Gemini \"may\" indicate if it referenced a past conversation to formulate a response. If the idea of a chatbot recalling information about you makes you feel uncomfortable, Google says users can \"easily review, delete or decide how long\" Gemini retains their chat history. Additionally, it's possible to disable this feature altogether from the My Activity panel. Gemini is not the first chatbot to include a memory feature. ChatGPT will \"remember\" things about you in certain contexts. For example, I recently asked OpenAI's chatbot a question about Jeff Buckley's vocal range, to which it later asked me if I was a fan of his music. When I said yes, a notification appeared stating \"memory updated.\"   More broadly, building chatbots with long, reliable memories is part of the \"agentic\" AI future many companies, including Google and OpenAI, are building towards. At I/O 2024, for instance, Google debuted Project Astra, which featured a built-in memory, though it was limited to a relatively short window of time and could \"mis-remember\" things.  Gemini's new memory feature has begun rolling out in English to Gemini Advanced subscribers. It will become available in more languages over the coming weeks.  This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/gemini-advanced-can-now-recall-your-past-conversations-to-inform-its-responses-222407226.html?src=rss",

    "description": "The spiritual successor to Life is Strange is heading to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog as a day-one freebie. The first installment of Don’t Nod’s Lost Records: Bloom \u0026 Rage hits Sony’s subscription service later this month, along with Star Wars Jedi: Survivor and immersive tennis in TopSpin 2K25. In addition, Sony previewed a couple of other cool-looking day-one titles heading to the service before long: Blue Prince and Abiotic Factor. Lost Records: Bloom \u0026 Rage tells the story of four high school friends (and punk rockers!) living in a deceptively picturesque Michigan town in 1995. The narrative adventure jumps between that era and 2022 as we gradually peel back the layers of, well, some freaky-ass stuff the girls uncovered. Don't Nod Each timeline gives you more of a glimpse into the “life-changing secrets” they stumbled upon back when Blues Traveler was on the charts — and why they’re reuniting 27 years later. If you were into the Life is Strange series, Lost Records: Bloom \u0026 Rage should be right up your alley. PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium members can claim the game on its February 18 release date. And if you get sucked into the world, you won’t have long to wait for the next chapter: It arrives in the April 15 batch of Sony’s catalog. EA / Respawn That’s also when Extra and Premium subscribers can claim Respawn’s Star Wars: Jedi Survivor. The follow-up to Jedi: Fallen Order puts you back in the boots of Cal Kestis as he tries to fend off the Empire and rebuild the Jedi Order. In our 2023 preview, Engadget’s Igor Bonifacic found it to be a bigger and better (if perhaps a bit too safe) sequel with larger worlds and new Force abilities to explore, as well as a handy grappling hook to kick it like Bionic Commando. Arriving a bit later is Blue Prince, Dogubomb’s clever title that takes the escape room concept and expands it into an entire mansion. Set in 1993, you inherit Mount Holly Estate, a sprawling building with a layout that changes daily. You get to choose its room configurations. The mansion has 45 rooms; your challenge is to find the 46th before all of your allotted movements expire. “Each door is a decision,” the developer promises. “And each room you pick adds another layer of strategy, puzzles and exploration to your adventure.” PS Plus subscribers can step into the mysterious world of Blue Prince on its release date “this spring.” Playstack / Deep Field Games Another day-one Plus title, Abiotic Factor is a six-player survival crafting game. Deep Field Games’ creepy title has throwback graphics and a survival crafting vibe. Up to six players (but you can play solo, too) take on the roles of scientists stranded miles underground in a strange research facility. “Caught between paranormal containment failure, a military crusade and chaos from a dozen realms, the world’s greatest minds must survive against the universe’s biggest threats,” the game blurb reads. It arrives as a day-one Game Catalog release this summer. Other titles available for Premium and Extra members on February 18 include Hangar 13’s TopSpin 2K25, where you can play as (among others) Serena Williams, Roger Federer or even throwbacks like Maria Sharapova and John McEnroe. The 2021 remake of the 1998 RPG SaGa Frontier is also on tap, as well as narrative sci-fi adventure Somerville, puzzle game Tin Hearts and the medieval slash-’em-up Mordhau.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/lost-records-and-blue-prince-are-coming-to-the-playstation-game-catalog-at-launch-213659797.html?src=rss",

In a Jan. 20 executive order, Trump said he instructed the attorney general \"not to take any action to enforce the act for a period of 75 days from today to allow my administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward.\" Apple confirmed the app will return \"Thursday evening.\" You can find the App Store listing for TikTok here.

    "description": "Reddit's recent earnings report revealed that AI licensing deals with Google and OpenAI account for about 10% of its $1.3 billion revenue, totaling approximately $130 million. With Google paying $60 million, OpenAI is estimated to be paying Reddit around $70 million annually for content licensing. Adweek reports: \"It's a small part of our revenue -- I'll call it 10%. For a business of our size, that's material, because it's valuable revenue,\" [said the company's COO Jen Wong]. The social platform -- which on Wednesday reported a 71% year-over-year lift in fourth-quarter revenue -- has been \"very thoughtful\" about the AI developers it chooses to work with, Wong said. To date, the company has inked two content licensing deals: one with Google for a reported $60 million, and one with ChatGPT parent OpenAI. Reddit has elected to work only with partners who can agree to \"specific terms ... that are really important to us.\" These terms include user privacy protections and conditions regarding \"how [Reddit is] represented,\" Wong said. While licensing agreements with AI firms offer a valuable business opportunity for Reddit, advertising remains the company's core revenue driver. Much of Reddit's $427.7 million Q4 revenues were generated by the ongoing expansion of its advertising business. And its ad revenue as a whole grew 60% YoY, underscoring the platform's growing appeal to brands. [...] Helping to accelerate ad revenue growth is Reddit's rising traffic. While Reddit's Q4 user growth came in under Wall Street projections, causing shares to dip, its weekly active uniques grew 42% YoY to over 379 million visitors. Average revenue per unique visitor was $4.21 during the quarter, up 23% from the prior year. While Google is \"nicely reinforcing\" Reddit's growth in traffic, Wong said, she added that the site's logged-in users, which have grown 27% year-over-year, are \"the bedrock of our business.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
