    "description": "Samsung's CES 2025 theme is \"AI for all.\"Samsung Samsung is the 800-pound gorilla of CES, a global electronics giant that produces mobile devices, TVs and home theater products and kitchen appliances — just to name a few. It's traditionally used CES to remind the world that it's a major competitor in all those arenas, while offering a peek behind the curtain of some more cutting-edge tech, too.  In 2024, for instance, Samsung's CES press conference covered all the usual iterative updates — new TVs, new projectors, new soundbars — but also offered up some genuinely futuristic product first looks as well. And while we won't see the transparent MicroLED screens at the local Best Buy anytime soon, you can already buy the Music Frame speaker that was first shown off at CES 2024. But it's the Ballie robot, a two-time CES veteran, that we're most hoping will make a return appearance — ideally with a real-world release date this time. What to expect at the Samsung CES 2025 press conference Or perhaps Ballie will be more autonomous this time around. That would better fit the \"AI for All: Everyday, Everywhere\" theme that the company has announced for its presentation in Las Vegas. The Korea-based giant has already posted several weeks worth of early CES announcements in its online newsroom, touting AI-enhanced refrigerators and appliances with built-in screens. But there's non-AI stuff, too: Samsung has preannounced a 27-inch QD-OLED gaming monitor, and the company is teaming up with Google (!) to deliver Eclipsa, a new 3D audio technology that is apparently aiming to be an alternative to Dolby Atmos and DTS.  One thing you shouldn't expect to see in Vegas: The presumed Galaxy S25 smartphone line. If it follows its recent scheduling, Samsung will likely slate that unveiling for the second half of January, when it will have the tech news spotlight to itself. (Last year it was a January 17 event, which was announced on January 11.) Samsung's CES 2025 livestream You can watch the Samsung CES press conference as it happens here. The feed will start Monday, January 6 at 5:00PM ET. (We'll add the embed once it becomes available.) This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/samsung-ces-2025-press-conference-watch-it-here-monday-at-5pm-et-005529946.html?src=rss",

    "link": "https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/01/04/0926232/should-waymo-robotaxis-always-stop-for-pedestrians-in-crosswalks?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon\u0026utm_medium=feed",
    "description": "\"My feet are already in the crosswalk,\" says Geoffrey A. Fowler, a San Francisco-based tech columnist for the Washington Post. In a video he takes one step from the curb, then stops to see if Waymo robotaxis will stop for him. And they often didn't. Waymo's position? Their cars consider \"signals of pedestrian intent\" including forward motion when deciding whether to stop — as well as other vehicles' speed and proximity. (\"Do they seem like they're about to cross or are they just sort of milling around waiting for someone?\") And Waymo \"also said its car might decide not to stop if adjacent cars don't yield.\" Fowler counters that California law says cars must always stop for pedestrians in a crosswalk. (\"It's classic Silicon Valley hubris to assume Waymo's ability to predict my behavior supersedes a law designed to protect me.\") And Phil Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University professor who conducts research on autonomous-vehicle safety, agrees that the Waymos should be stopping. \"Instead of arguing that they shouldn't stop if human drivers are not going to stop, they could conspicuously stop for pedestrians who are standing on road pavement on a marked crosswalk. That might improve things for everyone by encouraging other drivers to do the same.\" From Fowler's video: I tried crossing in front of Waymos here more than 20 times. About three in ten times the Waymo would stop for me, but I couldn't figure out what made it change its mind. Heavy traffic vs light, crossing with two people, sticking one foot out — all would cause it to stop only sometimes. I could make it stop by darting out into the street — but that's not how my mama taught me to use a crosswalk... Look, I know many human drivers don't stop for pedestrians either. But isn't the whole point of having artificial intelligence robot drivers that they're safer because they actually follow the laws? Waymo would not admit breaking any laws, but acknowledged \"opportunity for continued improvement in how it interacts with pedestrians.\" In an article accompanying the video, Fowler calls it \"a cautionary tale about how AI, intended to make us more safe, also needs to learn how to coexist with us.\" Waymo cars don't behave this way at all intersections. Some friends report that the cars are too careful on quiet streets, while others say the vehicles are too aggressive around schools... No Waymo car has hit me, or any other person walking in a San Francisco crosswalk — at least so far. (It did strike a cyclist earlier this year.) The company touts that, as of October, its cars have 57 percent fewer police-reported crashes compared with a human driving the same distance in the cities where it operates. Other interesting details from the article: Fowler suggests a way his crosswalk could be made safer: \"a flashing light beacon there could let me flag my intent to both humans and robots.\" The article points out that Waymo is also under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \"for driving in an unexpected and disruptive manner, including around traffic control devices (which includes road markings).\" At the same time, Fowler also acknowledges that \"I generally find riding in a Waymo to be smooth and relaxing, and I have long assumed its self-driving technology is a net benefit for the city.\" His conclusion? \"The experience has taught my family that the safest place around an autonomous vehicle is inside it, not walking around it.\" And he says living in San Francisco lately puts him \"in a game of chicken with cars driven by nothing but artificial intelligence.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "\"Electric vehicles are expected to outsell cars with internal combustion engines in China for the first time next year,\" reports the Financial Times, calling it \"a historic inflection point that puts the world's biggest car market years ahead of western rivals.\" China is set to smash international forecasts and Beijing's official targets with domestic EV sales — including pure battery and plug-in hybrids — growing about 20 per cent year on year to more than 12mn cars in 2025, according to the latest estimates supplied to the Financial Times by four investment banks and research groups. The figure would be more than double the 5.9mn sold in 2022. At the same time, sales of traditionally powered cars are expected to fall by more than 10 per cent next year to less than 11 million, reflecting a near 30 per cent plunge from 14.8 million in 2022... Robert Liew, director of Asia-Pacific renewables research at Wood Mackenzie, said China's EV milestone signalled its success in domestic technology development and securing global supply chains for critical resources needed for EVs and their batteries. The industry's scale meant steep manufacturing cost reductions and lower prices for consumers. \"They want to electrify everything,\" said Liew. \"No other country comes close to China.\" While the pace of Chinese EV sales growth has eased from a post-pandemic frenzy, the forecasts suggest Beijing's official target, set in 2020, for EVs to account for 50 per cent of car sales by 2035, will be achieved 10 years in advance of schedule... As China's EV market tracked towards year-on-year growth of near 40 per cent in 2024, the market share of foreign-branded cars fell to a record low of 37 per cent — a sharp decline from 64 per cent in 2020, according to data from Automobility, a Shanghai-based consultancy. In this month alone, GM wrote down more than $5 billion (€4.8 billion) of its business value in China; the holding company behind Porsche warned of a writedown in its Volkswagen stake of up to €20 billion; and arch rivals Nissan and Honda said they were responding to a \"drastically changing business environment\" with a merger. \"Meanwhile, EV sales growth has slowed in Europe and the US, reflecting the legacy car industry's slow embrace of new technology, uncertainty over government subsidies and rising protectionism against imports from China...\" Thanks to long-time Slashdot reader AmiMoJo for sharing the news.

    "description": "Our growing reliance on technology at home and in the workplace has raised the profile of e-waste. This consists of discarded electrical devices including laptops, smartphones, televisions, computer servers, washing machines, medical equipment, games consoles and much more. The amount of e-waste produced this decade could reach as much as 5 million metric tonnes, according to recent research published in Nature. This is around 1,000 times more e-waste than was produced in 2023. According to the study, the boom in artificial intelligence will significantly contribute to this e-waste problem, because AI requires lots of computing power and storage.

    "description": "Businesses are already being radically transformed by artificial intelligence (AI). Tools now exist that offer instantaneous, high-quality results in improving certain operations without the burden of high costs or delays. In fact, generative AI could completely upend the traditional ways that we measure success in business. Generative AI refers to programs that produce high-quality text, images, ideas and even complex software code in response to prompts (questions or instructions) from a user. Applications powered by data-driven algorithms enable users to quickly create high-quality content, redefining traditional measures of success.
