    "description": "Google Maps now officially shows the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America if you open the app in the US. In a blog post, Google said it rolled out the named change because the government has already updated the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), which decides the \"federal and national standard for geographic nomenclature.\" One of the executive orders President Donald Trump signed in January when he took office renames the body of water, but Google previously explained that it's the company's longstanding policy to wait for official government resources to be updated before applying any name change. The Gulf of America label will only be visible if you use the Maps app in the US, or if you open Maps on the web and your device's location is set to the region. If you're in Mexico, the label still shows Gulf of Mexico. And if you're elsewhere, you'll see it marked as both, specifically: Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America). It's also longstanding policy for the company to show official local names when they vary between countries. Trump's executive order also renames Denali, the highest mountain peak in North America, to Mount McKinley. So far, the location is still being shown as Denali on Maps.  Google Separately, Apple updated its Maps application and website to include the new nomenclature for US users. At present, the company's map graphics still display \"Gulf of Mexico,\" but clicking on the region brings up a card that says \"Gulf of America.\" Searching for \"Gulf of Mexico\" brings up the same GoA card.  According to Bloomberg, Apple won't limit this change to only the US. The news org, paraphrasing Apple, said that the company will \"soon roll out the shift for all users globally.\" We have reached out to Apple to confirm that users worldwide, including those in Mexico, will see Gulf of America on the company's maps. A Congressional Research Service report on how and where geographical name changes apply specifically says that \"private companies such as Google Maps and Apple Maps\" would be unaffected by President Trump's Executive Order. The report also notes that decisions from the US Board on Geographic Names, which was responsible for actioning the name change, only apply to federal use. Update, February 11, 5:35PM ET: This story and its headline were updated to reflect Apple's decision to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico in its Maps application. Additional context on geographical name changes from a Congressional Research Service report was also added.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/google-adopts-gulf-of-america-for-us-maps-users-140026397.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Google has set the date for its next I/O developer conference. This year, the annual event will take place over two days starting on May 20, the company announced on Tuesday. As in previous years, the conference will feature an in-person component at the Shoreline Amphitheatre right on the company's doorstep in Mountain View, California.  \"We’ll start day one with keynotes, followed by breakout sessions, workshops, demos, networking opportunities and more continuing on day two,\" Google said. In a separate email the company sent to Engadget, it promised to share updates on Gemini and Android, alongside new innovations related to web and cloud development. Last year's conference saw Google spend a lot of time talking about AI, including initiatives like Project Astra, and it's probably a safe bet to say I/O 2025 will be similar in that regard, with potential updates from DeepMind on Gemini 2.0, Project Mariner and more.  Notably, this year I/O will overlap with Microsoft Build, which is set to run from May 19 to 22. Like I/O, Build is expected to include a major focus on AI.   This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-io-2025-kicks-off-on-may-20-212810869.html?src=rss",

    "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: Since 2022, blogging site Tumblr has been teasing its plans to integrate with the fediverse -- the open social web powered by the protocol ActivityPub also used by Mastodon, Threads, Flipboard, and others. Now, the Automattic-owned blogging platform is sharing more information about when and how that integration could actually happen. As it turns out, the current plan to tie Tumblr into the open social web will come about by way of the site's planned move to the WordPress infrastructure. Automattic confirmed to TechCrunch that when the migration is complete, every Tumblr user will be able to federate their blog via ActivityPub, just as every WordPress.com user can today. The company noted that the migration could also allow for other open web integrations, like giving Tumblr users a way to run other custom plug-ins or themes. Last summer, Automattic announced it would move its half a billion blogs to WordPress, to make it easier for the company to build tools and features that worked across both services, while also allowing Tumblr to take advantage of the open source developments from WordPress.org. Though the WordPress community itself is in a state of upheaval, ultimately running Tumblr's back end on WordPress would allow for greater efficiencies, while not changing the interface and experience that Tumblr's user base has grown to love. Automattic declined to share a time frame as to when the migration would be complete, given its scale, but a rep for the company called the progress so far \"exciting.\" Automattic didn't say if it would consider integrating with the AT Protocol that powers Bluesky.

Sine.Engineering built the system to counter Russia’s electronic warfare, which has wreaked havoc on GPS signals.  To dodge the interference, Sine invented a satellite-free replacement. The approach is inspired by time-of-flight (ToF) methods, which began tracking aircraft long before the advent of GPS.   Unlike GPS, ToF systems don’t rely on satellites. Instead, they measure the time it takes a signal to between a transmitter and a target.

This includes avenues such as earning ad revenue and participating in the burgeoning market of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).
