    "description": "Meta has released the first two models from its multimodal Llama 4 suite: LLama 4 Scout and Llama 4 Maverick. Maverick is “the workhorse” of the two and excels at image and text understanding for “general assistant and chat use cases,” the company said in a blog post, while the smaller model Scout could tackle things like “multi-document summarization, parsing extensive user activity for personalized tasks, and reasoning over vast codebases.” The company also introduced Llama 4 Behemoth, an upcoming model it says is “among the world’s smartest LLMs” — and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said we’ll be hearing about a fourth model, LLama 4 Reasoning, “in the next month.”  Both Maverick and Scout are available to download now from the LLama website and Hugging Face, and they’ve been added to Meta AI, including for WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram DMs.  Meta Scout has 17 billion active parameters with 16 experts, Meta says. According to Zuckerberg, “It’s extremely fast, natively multimodal, and has an industry leading, nearly infinite 10 million token context length, and it is designed to run on a single GPU.” Maverick on the other hand has 17 billion active parameters with 128 experts. The company says it beats competitors like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 on coding, reasoning, multilingual, long-context and image benchmarks, and stacks up against DeepSeek v3.1 on reasoning and coding. Zuckerberg is already calling the upcoming Behemoth model, which is still training, “the highest performing base model in the world,” with 288 billion active parameters, according to the company. It may not be here yet, but it’s likely we’ll be hearing a lot more about that and the Reasoning model soon; Meta’s big AI developer conference, LlamaCon, is just a few weeks away.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-introduces-llama-4-with-two-new-models-available-now-and-two-more-on-the-way-214524295.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Amazon's new feature could make it easier to get into the latest release in a series, especially if it's been some time since you've read the previous books. The new Recaps feature is part of the latest software update for the Kindle, and the company compares it to \"Previously on...\" segments you can watch for TV shows. Amazon announced Recaps in a blog post, where it said that you can get access to it once you receive the software update over the air or after you download and install it from Amazon's website. Amazon didn't talk about the technology behind the feature in its post, but a spokesperson has confirmed to TechCrunch that the recaps will be AI generated.  Shortly after the feature rolled out, users talked about it on social media, wondering if Amazon is using generative AI to write series summaries. They expressed concerns about the use of generative AI, especially about the possibility of the technology hallucinating plot elements that aren't actually in the books. \"We use technology, including GenAI and Amazon moderators, to create short recaps of books that accurately reflect book content,\" Amazon spokesperson Ale Iraheta told the publication. Iraheta assured TechCrunch that Amazon's recaps are accurate, but of course, use it at your own risk.  At the moment, the Recaps feature is available for best-selling English-language book series on all Kindle devices in the US. To know if your favorite series has one, look for the \"View Recaps\" button within the series page in your Kindle library. It will soon be available for the Kindle app on iOS, as well. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-will-use-ai-to-generate-recaps-for-book-series-on-the-kindle-170018503.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Berkeley, California is \"the latest city to try to block landlords from using algorithms when deciding rents,\" reports the Associated Press (noting that officials in many cities claim the practice is driving up the price of housing). But then real estate software company RealPage filed a federal lawsuit against Berkeley on Wednesday: Texas-based RealPage said Berkeley's ordinance, which goes into effect this month, violates the company's free speech rights and is the result of an \"intentional campaign of misinformation and often-repeated false claims\" about its products. The U.S. Department of Justice sued Realpage in August under former President Joe Biden, saying its algorithm combines confidential information from each real estate management company in ways that enable landlords to align prices and avoid competition that would otherwise push down rents. That amounts to cartel-like illegal price collusion, prosecutors said. RealPage's clients include huge landlords who collectively oversee millions of units across the U.S. In the lawsuit, the Department of Justice pointed to RealPage executives' own words about how their product maximizes prices for landlords. One executive said, \"There is greater good in everybody succeeding versus essentially trying to compete against one another in a way that actually keeps the entire industry down.\" San Francisco, Philadelphia and Minneapolis have since passed ordinances restricting landlords from using rental algorithms. The Department of Justice case remains ongoing, as do lawsuits against RealPage brought by tenants and the attorneys general of Arizona and Washington, D.C... [On a conference call, RealPage attorney Stephen Weissman told reporters] RealPage officials were never given an opportunity to present their arguments to the Berkeley City Council before the ordinance was passed and said the company is considering legal action against other cities that have passed similar policies, including San Francisco. RealPage blames high rents not on the software they make, but on a lack of housing supply... Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Over on Reddit's \"selfhosted\" subreddit for alternatives to popular services, long-time Slashdot reader Zoup described a pain point: - Landlock is a Linux Security Module (LSM) that lets unprivileged processes restrict themselves. - It's been in the kernel since 5.13, but the API is awkward to use directly. - It always annoyed the hell out of me to run random binaries from the internet without any real control over what they can access. So they've rolled their own solution, according to Thursday's submission to Slashdot: I just released Landrun, a Go-based CLI tool that wraps Linux Landlock (5.13+) to sandbox any process without root, containers, or seccomp. Think firejail, but minimal and kernel-native. Supports fine-grained file access (ro/rw/exec) and TCP port restrictions (6.7+). No daemons, no YAML, just flags. Example (where --rox allows read-only access with execution to specified path): # landrun --rox /usr touch /tmp/filetouch: cannot touch '/tmp/file': Permission denied# landrun --rox /usr --rw /tmp touch /tmp/file# It's MIT-licensed, easy to audit, and now supports systemd services.
