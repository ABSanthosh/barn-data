    "description": "The weeklong speedrunning marathon Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 wrapped up in the wee hours of Sunday morning, and organizers say it managed to pull in a total of $2,556,305 for Prevent Cancer Foundation.¬† As could be expected, the event in Pittsburgh brought a good mix of skill and silliness: there was a Crazy Taxi speedrun featuring a live band; FunkopotamusWes played the piano during his run of New Super Mario Bros. Wii, using his head and feet to control the game via motion controls; and Dr. Doot did an Elden Ring bosses speedrun using an electric saxophone. Yes, the saxophone did make little doot doot sounds the entire time. The marathon ran continuously from January 5-12, so there are many, many more great moments besides these to catch up on if you missed it. Everything can be found on the Games Done Quick YouTube channel. AGDQ is one of several charity-focused events held by Games Done Quick every year, and the next one, Back to Black is coming up in February. Highlighting Black hosts and speedrunners, that event (Feb 6-9) will raise money for the racial justice nonprofit, Race Forward. Over the years, Games Done Quick has raised more than $54 million for various charities including Prevent Cancer Foundation and Doctors Without Borders. AGDQ raised about $2.5 million during its marathon last year, too.¬† This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/awesome-games-done-quick-raises-another-25-million-for-a-cancer-nonprofit-202228938.html?src=rss",

    "description": "It‚Äôs looking more and more like the rumored ultra-thin iPhone we‚Äôve been hearing about for the last few months will get Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄúAir‚Äù branding. In the Power On newsletter, Bloomberg‚Äôs Mark Gurman says the iPhone 17 lineup will feature a new model that could be called the iPhone 17 Air, and it‚Äôll be roughly 2 millimeters thinner than any other model we‚Äôve seen yet. ‚ÄúIt will have a base-level A19 chip and a single-lens camera system,‚Äù Gurman notes, and will serve ‚Äúas a testing ground for future technologies, including ones that could allow for foldable devices.‚Äù That and the upcoming new iPhone SE will use Apple‚Äôs first in-house modem, according to Gurman. We‚Äôre also likely to see upgrades to the entry-level iPad that will make it compatible with Apple Intelligence. Gurman reports that the next generation of iPad will get the A17 Pro chip and 8 GB of memory. That news should come in the spring along with the iPhone SE and new iPad Air models, according to Gurman.

    "description": "\"The U.K is looking to build a homegrown challenger to OpenAI and drastically increase national computing infrastructure,\" reports CNBC, \"as Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government sets its sights on becoming a global leader in artificial intelligence.\" The government is primarily seeking to expand data center capacity across the U.K. to boost developers of powerful AI models which rely on high-performance computing equipment hosted in remote locations to train and run their systems. A target of increasing \"sovereign,\" or public sector, compute capacity in the U.K. by twentyfold by 2030 has been set... To further bolster Britain's computing infrastructure, the government also committed to setting up several AI \"growth zones,\" where rules on planning permission will be relaxed in certain places to allow for the creation of new data centers. Meanwhile, an \"AI Energy Council\" formed of industry leaders from both energy and AI will be set up to explore the role of renewable and low-carbon sources of energy, like nuclear... Britain plans to use the AI growth zones and a newly established National Data Library to connect public institutions ‚Äî such as universities ‚Äî to enhance the country's ability to create \"sovereign\" AI models which aren't reliant on Silicon Valley... Last month, the government announced a consultation on measures to regulate the use of copyrighted content to train AI models. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
