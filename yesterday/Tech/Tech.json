    "description": "New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) have settled on new minimum-wage rules for rideshare drivers, Bloomberg reports. Drivers will receive a five percent raise under the new proposal, a compromise to keep Uber and Lyft from locking drivers out of their apps. The proposal needs to be voted on by the TLC's board of commissioners before it goes into effect, but assuming it does, it'll end months of uncertainty for drivers working in the city. Uber began sporadically locking drivers out of its app in May 2024, preventing them taking rides and earning money. The company was blocking access to its app to avoid having to pay drivers who were working but not actively taking rides. Besides introducing a minimum wage for drivers that started around $18 per hour in 2022, New York also included stipulations in its law that required drivers be paid for the downtime between rides, something Uber and Lyft naturally had a problem with. Bloomberg writes that the TLC initially proposed a 6.1 percent raise in an attempt to disincentivize Uber and Lyft from locking drivers out. The proposal would adjust how driver pay is calculated, in exchange for an upfront raise and a guarantee that drivers are warned before they lose access to a rideshare app. Settling on a five percent raise and a commitment to not raise wages yearly and instead based \"changing industry dynamics,\" is a further capitulation. One that's still not enough for Lyft, apparently. The company told Bloomberg that, \"while these changes are a step in the right direction, we still have concerns that the underlying pay formula will still deprive drivers of earning opportunities, drive up prices for riders and reduce ride availability.\" Uber and Lyft have long had a contentious relationship with city and state governments over driver protections. In comparison to the passing of Prop 22 in California, which reclassified gig workers as contractors after another law did the opposite, even a diminished minimum wage law in New York is better than nothing.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/nyc-proposes-5-percent-raise-for-rideshare-drivers-in-a-bid-to-appease-uber-and-lyft-220011937.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Remedy has shared its plans to improve FBC: Firebreak, the new multiplayer Control spinoff, following a string of less-than-stellar reviews that criticized the game's rough early hours. FBC: Firebreak was announced in October 2024 as the first online multiplayer game from Remedy, and another pitstop on the way to an eventual Control 2. The full patch notes for Remedy's first update are available to view on Steam, but in brief, the biggest change the developer is making is to how missions are unlocked. Previously, Firebreak required players to play a simpler, shorter version of the game's missions (like dealing with multiplying post-it notes or pink goo, for example), before a more complex version of the mission became available. Now those full-fat missions are available from the start, and completing one unlocks the next type. Remedy's update also rebalances the cost of cosmetics and makes it easier to see and find in-game collectibles, among other tweaks. The developer is planning to make larger changes to how FBC: Firebreak explains the synergies of in-game weapons and abilities, but those onboarding improvements will take longer to implement. Future updates adding new missions and cosmetics where already planned for the game, so fixes will presumably be worked into the existing roadmap. We enjoyed our hands-on time with FBC: Firebreak, but reviewers report a less rosy picture after playing the game over a longer period of time. Eurogamer found Firebreak charming in Remedy's typical oddball way, but also inconsistent in terms of difficulty. GameSpot noted similar messiness in the game's mission design, and also the general lack of explanation for weapons and abilities. The more damning and existential problem highlighted by TechRadar is the dearth of story in the game, something that Control generally excelled at. Remedy doesn't appear to have a plan to address any perceived narrative shortcomings in FBC: Firebreak, and since it's a multiplayer game, the company may just have different goals. FBC: Firebreak is available now for $40 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC. If you pay for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or PlayStation Plus Game Catalog, you can play the game at no additional cost.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/remedy-is-trying-to-fix-fbc-firebreak-in-response-to-middling-reviews-and-player-feedback-203805921.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Ancient Slashdot reader Alain Williams shares a report from The Guardian: The BBC is threatening legal action against Perplexity AI, in the corporation's first move to protect its content from being scraped without permission to build artificial intelligence technology. The corporation has sent a letter to Aravind Srinivas, the chief executive of the San Francisco-based startup, saying it has gathered evidence that Perplexity's model was \"trained using BBC content.\" The letter, first reported by the Financial Times, threatens an injunction against Perplexity unless it stops scraping all BBC content to train its AI models, and deletes any copies of the broadcaster's material it holds unless it provides \"a proposal for financial compensation.\" The legal threat comes weeks after Tim Davie, the director general of the BBC, and the boss of Sky both criticised proposals being considered by the government that could let tech companies use copyright-protected work without permission. \"If we currently drift in the way we are doing now we will be in crisis,\" Davie said, speaking at the Enders conference. \"We need to make quick decisions now around areas like ... protection of IP. We need to protect our national intellectual property, that is where the value is. What do I need? IP protection; come on, let's get on with it.\" \"Perplexity's tool [which allows users to choose between different AI models] directly competes with the BBC's own services, circumventing the need for users to access those services,\" the corporation said. Perplexity told the FT that the BBC's claims were \"manipulative and opportunistic\" and that it had a \"fundamental misunderstanding of technology, the internet and intellectual property law.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Europe must take bigger bets on young founders to build tomorrow’s tech giants, industry leaders urged today. Speaking at TNW Conference, investors and CEOs called for stronger support for entrepreneurial ambition — before Europe’s best ideas and brightest minds head elsewhere. Kieran Hill, General Partner at 20VC — a venture capital firm founded by podcast host Harry Stebbings — urged the continent’s institutions to expand their appetite for risk. “We need to change how we sell ambition,” he said.

    "description": "A saliva-based fertility tracker has received regulatory approval for use as a contraceptive in Europe.
