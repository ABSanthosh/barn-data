    "description": "The FBI issued a statement on Saturday about deceptive videos circulating ahead of the election, saying it‚Äôs aware of two such videos ‚Äúfalsely claiming to be from the FBI relating to election security.‚Äù That includes one claiming the FBI had ‚Äúapprehended three linked groups committing ballot fraud,‚Äù and one about Kamala Harris‚Äô husband. Both depict false content, the FBI said. Disinformation ‚Äî including the spread of political deepfakes and other forms of misleading videos and imagery ‚Äî has been a major concern in the leadup to the US presidential election. In its statement posted on X, the FBI added: Election integrity is among our highest priorities, and the FBI is working closely with state and local law enforcement partners to respond to election threats and protect our communities as Americans exercise their right to vote. Attempts to deceive the public with false content about FBI operations undermines our democratic process and aims to erode trust in the electoral system.

    "description": "There‚Äôs a great deal on Apple‚Äôs AirPods Pro 2 over at Amazon right now. The earbuds are currently 28 percent off, bringing them down to $179. That‚Äôs just $10 more than the all-time-low price we saw during October Prime Day, and will save you $70. The AirPods Pro 2 got an update earlier this year that brought some major new features, most notably a suite of hearing health tools and the capability to be used as hearing aids. On top of that, they now offer new gesture-based Siri Interactions and Voice Isolation to reduce background noise when you‚Äôre on a call. Siri Interactions allow for hands- and voice-free Siri controls; you can respond to Siri‚Äôs questions simply by nodding or shaking your head. The second-generation AirPods Pro are the best earbuds for iPhone users, with better sound quality than their predecessors and seamless integration with the other devices in the Apple ecosystem. The AirPods Pro 2 offer active noise cancellation and transparency mode, which allows for more natural conversations while they‚Äôre in your ear. They also support spatial audio and Dolby Atmos for certain media. The buds come with four pairs of silicone tips in different sizes and are IP54 rated for protection against dust and sweat. They get up to 6 hours of listening time (though this will be less with certain features, like ANC, enabled) and up to 30 hours with a little help from the USB-C MagSafe Charging Case. Check out all of the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals here.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apples-airpods-pro-2-drop-to-179-in-this-early-black-friday-deal-161357773.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Don't Look Now, but GM's EV Sales Are on Fire",
    "link": "https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/11/02/2251208/dont-look-now-but-gms-ev-sales-are-on-fire?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon\u0026utm_medium=feed",
    "description": "GM's president of global markets says their EV portfolio \"is growing faster than the market,\" according to Investopedia, \"because we have an all-electric vehicle for just about everybody, no matter what they like to drive.\" The headline at Barrons? \"Don't Look Now, but GM's EV Sales Are on Fire.\" GM delivered almost 32,000 all-electric vehicles in the third quarter ‚Äî a record ‚Äî and up about 58% from a year earlier. The more affordable Chevy Equinox, which starts at about $35,000 before any federal tax credit, helped boost sales. GM delivered almost 10,000 of the new EVs, up from 1,013 in the second quarter, when they first went on sale. EV penetration of total GM car sales was about almost 5%, up almost two percentage points year over year. EVs accounted for 19.4% of Cadillac sales, up about 11 percentage points year over year. Year to date, GM has delivered just over 70,000 all-electric cars. GM originally planned to manufacture 200,000 EVs in 2024. That still looks aggressive, but the strong third-quarter showing makes 120,000 possible, which would be up almost 60% year over year ‚Äî a respectable outcome. More important to investors than EV sales right now might be dealer inventories. GM said there were about 627,000 vehicles on dealer lots at the end of September. That's a little better than what Wolfe Research analyst Emmanuel Rosner expected. It indicates GM dealers have roughly 60 days worth of sales on their lots. That's a safe level. Lower dealer inventories reduce presure to reduce prices. They also reduce the need to cut production because dealer lots are full... GM expects to generate a full-year operating profit of about $14 billion. Meanwhile, Stellantis \"slashed its financial guidance recently, partly because it needs to dramatically reduce its U.S. inventories,\" according to the article. For example, its Jeep dealers ended August with roughly 122 days worth of sales on their lots, while its Dodge dealers \"had almost 150 days of inventory.\" And Investopedia argues that while GM's EV sales growth is \"soaring,\" Ford's is showing \"only modest gains.\" [W]hile Ford's overall U.S. sales were 0.7% higher at 504,039, it had just a 12% gain in EVs to 23,509.3 In the second quarter, Ford's EV sales had soared 61% to 23,957. Sales growth was more than three times higher for Ford's hybrid models, with President of Ford Blue and Ford Customer Service Division Andrew Frick arguing that the company has \"listened to customers to offer them vehicles with powertrains to meet their specific needs.\" Ford is hoping to boost EV sales by offering buyers a free home charger and installation.

    "description": "\"AI-driven 0-day detection is here,\" argues a new blog post from ZeroPath, makers of a GitHub app that \"detects, verifies, and issues pull requests for security vulnerabilities in your code.\" They write that AI-assisted security research \"has been quietly advancing\" since early 2023, when researchers at the DARPA and ARPA-H's Artificial Intelligence Cyber Challenge demonstrated the first practical applications of LLM-powered vulnerability detection ‚Äî with new advances continuing. \"Since July 2024, ZeroPath's tool has uncovered critical zero-day vulnerabilities ‚Äî including remote code execution, authentication bypasses, and insecure direct object references ‚Äî in popular AI platforms and open-source projects.\" And they ultimately identified security flaws in projects owned by Netflix, Salesforce, and Hulu by \"taking a novel approach combining deep program analysis with adversarial AI agents for validation. Our methodology has uncovered numerous critical vulnerabilities in production systems, including several that traditional Static Application Security Testing tools were ill-equipped to find...\" TL;DR ‚Äî most of these bugs are simple and could have been found with a code review from a security researcher or, in some cases, scanners. The historical issue, however, with automating the discovery of these bugs is that traditional SAST tools rely on pattern matching and predefined rules, and miss complex vulnerabilities that do not fit known patterns (i.e. business logic problems, broken authentication flaws, or non-traditional sinks such as from dependencies). They also generate a high rate of false positives. The beauty of LLMs is that they can reduce ambiguity in most of the situations that caused scanners to be either unusable or produce few findings when mass-scanning open source repositories... To do this well, you need to combine deep program analysis with an adversarial agents that test the plausibility of vulnerabilties at each step. The solution ends up mirroring the traditional phases of a pentest ‚Äî recon, analysis, exploitation (and remediation which is not mentioned in this post)... AI-driven vulnerability detection is moving fast... What's intriguing is that many of these vulnerabilities are pretty straightforward ‚Äî they could've been spotted with a solid code review or standard scanning tools. But conventional methods often miss them because they don't fit neatly into known patterns. That's where AI comes in, helping us catch issues that might slip through the cracks. \"Many vulnerabilities remain undisclosed due to ongoing remediation efforts or pending responsible disclosure processes,\" according to the blog post, which includes a pie chart showing the biggest categories of vulnerabilities found: 53%: Authorization flaws, including roken access control in API endpoints and unauthorized Redis access and configuration exposure. (\"Impact: Unauthorized access, data leakage, and resource manipulation across tenant boundaries.\") 26%: File operation issues, including directory traversal in configuration loading and unsafe file handling in upload features. (\"Impact: Unauthorized file access, sensitive data exposure, and potential system compromise.\") 16%: Code execution vulnerabilities, including command injection in file processing and unsanitized input in system commands. (\"Impact: Remote code execution, system command execution, and potential full system compromise.\") The company's CIO/cofounder was \"former Red Team at Tesla,\" according to the startup's profile at YCombinator, and earned over $100,000 as a bug-bounty hunter. (And another co-founded is a former Google security engineer.) Thanks to Slashdot reader Mirnotoriety for sharing the article. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
