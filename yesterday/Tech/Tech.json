    "description": "Apple is reportedly planning to introduce a small but welcome convenience feature with iOS 19: cross-device syncing for Wi-Fi access portals. This is according to the latest Power On newsletter from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. The feature would address the annoyance of having to individually fill out pop-up forms to access public Wi-Fi on all your devices, like when you're at a hotel. According to Gurman, \"This new feature will let you enter that information on one device and have it synced to your other products.\" It's one of several upcoming features Apple may show off at its Worldwide Developers Conference, which is set for June 9-13 this year. The event is expected to bring some major design changes to the company's operating systems that should make for a more consistent look between its products' software. Gurman also reports that AirPods may be getting a live translation feature, which we could see at WWDC alongside a revamped Health app. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-19-may-bring-a-feature-that-makes-signing-into-public-wi-fi-less-of-a-hassle-210435303.html?src=rss",

    "description": "As first reported by Politico, the Trump administration has fired the Register of Copyrights and US Copyright Office Director, Shira Perlmutter. The Register of Copyrights works under the Librarian of Congress — a title held most recently by Carla Hayden, who was fired earlier this week for her DEI efforts, as White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told The New York Times. Perlmutter's dismissal comes just after the office released a report that raised concerns about certain uses of copyrighted material to train generative AI. It's the third in a series of papers published over the last year analyzing copyright law as it pertains to AI. The Trump administration — particularly DOGE — has been pushing for broader use of AI. In April, the White House called on federal agencies to develop AI strategies and name Chief AI Officers that will \"serve as change agents and AI advocates.\" In a statement released after news of Perlmutter's firing came to light, Congressman Joe Morelle, the top Democrat on the Committee on House Administration, called the move \"a brazen, unprecedented power grab with no legal basis,\" saying, \"It is surely no coincidence [Donald Trump] acted less than a day after she refused to rubber-stamp Elon Musk’s efforts to mine troves of copyrighted works to train AI models.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trump-has-fired-the-director-of-the-us-copyright-office-195646724.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Fusion energy \"took one step closer to reality,\" announced the University of Texas at Austin, as their researchers joined with a team from Los Alamos National Laboratory and Type One Energy Group and \"solved a longstanding problem in the field\" — how to contain high-energy particles inside fusion reactors. When high-energy alpha particles leak from a reactor, that prevents the plasma from getting hot and dense enough to sustain the fusion reaction. To prevent them from leaking, engineers design elaborate magnetic confinement systems, but there are often holes in the magnetic field, and a tremendous amount of computational time is required to predict their locations and eliminate them. In their paper published in Physical Review Letters, the research team describes having discovered a shortcut that can help engineers design leak-proof magnetic confinement systems 10 times as fast as the gold standard method, without sacrificing accuracy... \"What's most exciting is that we're solving something that's been an open problem for almost 70 years,\" said Josh Burby, assistant professor of physics at UT and first author of the paper. \"It's a paradigm shift in how we design these reactors....\" This new method also can help with a similar but different problem in another popular magnetic fusion reactor design called a tokamak. In that design, there's a problem with runaway electrons — high-energy electrons that can punch a hole in the surrounding walls. This new method can help identify holes in the magnetic field where these electrons might leak. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Cybersecurity researchers have flagged three malicious npm packages that target the macOS version of AI-powered code-editing tool Cursor, reports The Hacker News: \"Disguised as developer tools offering 'the cheapest Cursor API,' these packages steal user credentials, fetch an encrypted payload from threat actor-controlled infrastructure, overwrite Cursor's main.js file, and disable auto-updates to maintain persistence,\" Socket researcher Kirill Boychenko said. All three packages continue to be available for download from the npm registry. \"Aiide-cur\" was first published on February 14, 2025... In total, the three packages have been downloaded over 3,200 times to date.... The findings point to an emerging trend where threat actors are using rogue npm packages as a way to introduce malicious modifications to other legitimate libraries or software already installed on developer systems... \"By operating inside a legitimate parent process — an IDE or shared library — the malicious logic inherits the application's trust, maintains persistence even after the offending package is removed, and automatically gains whatever privileges that software holds, from API tokens and signing keys to outbound network access,\" Socket told The Hacker News. \"This campaign highlights a growing supply chain threat, with threat actors increasingly using malicious patches to compromise trusted local software,\" Boychenko said. The npm packages \"restart the application so that the patched code takes effect,\" letting the threat actor \"execute arbitrary code within the context of the platform.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "A year ago this week, a viral hit offered a glimpse into the future of AI music: “BBL Drizzy.” The song emerged during the feud between Kendrick Lamar and Drake.
