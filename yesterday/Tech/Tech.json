    "description": "The US Department of Justice has indicted Albert Sangier for defrauding investors with misleading statements about his Nate financial technology platform. Founded by Sangier in 2018, Nate claimed it could offer shoppers a universal checkout app thanks to artificial intelligence. However, the indictment states that the so-called AI-powered transactions in Nate were actually completed by human contractors in the Philippines and Romania or by bots. Sangier raised more than $40 million from investors for the app. This case follows reporting by The Information in 2022 that cast light on Nate's use of human labor rather than AI. Sources told the publication that during 2021, \"the share of transactions Nate handled manually rather than automatically ranged between 60 percent and 100 percent.\" Many ambitious and ethically challenged entrepreneurs have attempted to make their fortunes by disguising human actions as a mechanical or technological innovation over the centuries. Claiming the results as AI work is just the most digital age application of the idea.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/tech-founder-charged-with-fraud-for-ai-that-was-secretly-overseas-contract-workers-225910022.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Motorola is gearing up to announce new phones on April 24, based on a short teaser video the company shared on X. The video shows what looks like two types of phone ‚Äî presumably a member of the 2025 Razr family and a Moto Edge ‚Äî sliding and unfolding into place to spell \"AI.\" There's little else to go on from the video other than the April 24, 2025 date and a glimpse of some new finish options for Motorola's phones, including a wood option. Last year's Razr and Razr+ came in a variety of bright, poppy colors with faux suede and leather backs. Historically, Motorola has also prided itself on offering unique customizations options, starting all the way back with the Moto X in 2013, which was also available with a wooden finish. It's possible that wood-paneled options ends up exclusive to the Moto Edge, but it would certainly make the Razr and Razr+ standout from other foldables if they got it, too. Big reveals. Iconicdesigns. Coming 4/24 ü§´. #MakeItIconic #GatewayToIconic pic.twitter.com/PhfPg4o71h‚Äî motorola (@Moto) April 10, 2025 Beyond that, the improvements Motorola could reasonably make to the Razr are more expected. It's made the front cover screen bigger before, and it could again on the 2025 Razr. The 2025 Razr+ couldn't get a bigger front display without Motorola changing the dimensions of the phone itself, but that's possible, too. If Motorola wanted to really offer a Razr worth upgrading to, it would also improve the phone's camera, fixing things like color reproduction and photo processing.¬† We should have a better idea of what Motorola has planned when it makes its April 24 announcement, until then, smart money is on the company cramming in a few more AI-powered features.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/youll-have-to-wait-until-april-24-to-know-if-motorola-was-brave-enough-to-make-a-wooden-razr-211723767.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Albert Saniger, the founder and former CEO of Nate, an AI shopping app that promised a \"universal\" checkout experience, was charged with defrauding investors on Wednesday, according to a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice. From a report: Founded in 2018, Nate raised over $50 million from investors like Coatue and Forerunner Ventures, most recently raising a $38 million Series A in 2021 led by Renegade Partners. Nate said its app's users could buy from any e-commerce site with a single click, thanks to AI. In reality, however, Nate relied heavily on hundreds of human contractors in a call center in the Philippines to manually complete those purchases, the DOJ's Southern District of New York alleges. Saniger raised millions in venture funding by claiming that Nate was able to transact online \"without human intervention,\" except for edge cases where the AI failed to complete a transaction. But despite Nate acquiring some AI technology and hiring data scientists, its app's actual automation rate was effectively 0%, the DOJ claims. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "The electricity consumption of data centres is projected to more than double by 2030, according to a report from the International Energy Agency published today. The primary culprit? AI. Nature: The report covers the current energy footprint for data centres and forecasts their future needs, which could help governments, companies, and local communities to plan infrastructure and AI deployment. IEA's models project that data centres will use 945 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2030, roughly equivalent to the current annual electricity consumption of Japan. By comparison, data centres consumed 415 TWh in 2024, roughly 1.5% of the world's total electricity consumption. The projections largely focus on data centres, which also run computing tasks other than AI. Although the agency estimated the proportion of servers in data centres devoted to AI. They found that servers for AI accounted for 24% of server electricity demand and 15% of total data centre energy demand in 2024. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
