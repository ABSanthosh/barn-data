    "description": "After largely focusing Google I/O 2025 on the ways the company wants Gemini to change everything from searching the web to filmmaking, Google is finally ready to launch new hardware. The next Made by Google event is on the books for August 20, and Google has already confirmed what at least one of its new Pixel 10 phones will look like. As in past years, Google isn't the only source for information on its new phones and wearables. Nearly all the new hardware the company is expected to announce has leaked in one form or another ahead of the event. With that in mind and after sifting through what's leaked, here's what Google is likely to show off at the Pixel 10 launch event in New York City on August 20. Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold Android Headlines / Onleaks Google's invitation for the event says that the company is sharing \"the latest on our Pixel phones, watches, buds and more,” which more or less confirms the company will introduce a slate of products that's similar to what it launched in 2024. That means a Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL and Pixel 10 Pro Fold are absolutely on the menu. Google's tease of the Pixel 10 confirmed what leaked renders have already signaled: the company isn't abandoning the new design language the Pixel 9 established. The pill-shaped camera bump and flat front display will still be present on the Pixel 10, and the real changes will be in the details, like for example, how the flat sides of the Pixel 10 join with the phone's back. Those subtle changes will apparently also include the thickness of the Pixel 10s. While both the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold will use the same sized OLED screens as their Pixel 9 counterparts, they'll be housed in thicker and heavier bodies, according to Android Headlines. Google's new Pixels are also supposed to come in new colors. The Pixel 10 will come in \"Frost\" (a royal blue), \"Lemongrass\" (a yellow), \"Indigo\" (a light purple) and \"Obsidian\" (a dark gray), while the Pixel 10 Pro / Pro XL will come in Obsidian, \"Porcelain\" (off-white), \"Moonstone\" (a bluish gray) and \"Jade\" (a light green). Less information is known about the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, though recent leaks suggest it'll come in Moonstone and Jade, as well. Android Headlines The most visible external change that'll be introduced on the Pixel 10 is the addition of a new telephoto camera. The new telephoto camera is a 11-megapixel 5x telephoto, Android Authority reports, similar to the one on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL are expected to feature a 50-megapixel wide, 48-megapixel ultrawide, 48-megapixel telephoto and 48-megapixel selfie cameras. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold could feature a different lineup, with a similar main camera, but 12-megapixel ultrawide and telephoto cameras, and 11-megapixel selfie cameras. Inside the new phones, Google is laying the groundwork for future performance gains with a new Tensor G5 chip. It's likely be much more power-efficient thanks to the company switching to a 3nm design produced by TSMC. Reports suggest the chip might not be all that different in terms of raw power, but the Tensor G5 is likely designed to be extra capable when it comes to using local AI features. Pixel Watch 4 91mobiles / Onleaks The third time was the charm for the Pixel Watch 3, so the main task Google has with the Pixel Watch 4 is to not squander the solid base it already has. Leaks for the company's new smartwatches have been limited so far, but renders of the Pixel Watch 4 shared by 91mobiles do suggest Google has a few changes planned. Namely, much like the company's phones, the new Pixel Watch seems like it'll be a little bit thicker and come with smaller bezels. The Pixel Watch 4 should be available to purchase in the same 41mm and 45mm sizes as before, but a thicker frame that could accommodate a larger battery, or a new wireless charging system. Notably, the renders are missing the charging pins used on the Pixel Watch 3. Beyond that, Google has already indicated how Wear OS is evolving. The new Wear OS 6 update is debuting on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, and will presumably be available on the Pixel Watch 4 at launch. It includes built-in access to Gemini, among other tweaks. Given Google also manages the Fitbit Premium subscription, it wouldn't be all that surprising if the Pixel Watch 4 gets some exclusive fitness tracking features, too. Pixel Buds 2a Billy Steele for Engadget Google launched the Pixel Buds Pro 2 last year, and it typically doesn't update its premium earbuds on a yearly cadence. So instead, Tom's Guide reports Google might pair the Pixel 10 with the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in a new color, and save its new hardware announcements for a sequel to the Pixel Buds A-series called the Pixel Buds 2a. Unlike the company's premium wireless earbuds, the A-series Pixel Buds have historically skimped on things like active noise cancellation to hit a lower price. There's little reporting on where Google will take the Pixel Buds 2a, but you can expect the new earbuds to come in some of the new colors being introduced on the Pixel 10. Pixelsnap The Qi2 wireless charging standard is available for all phone makers to use, but it hasn't been widely adopted among Android phone makers. Qi2 uses magnets to offer improved charging speeds, just like Apple's MagSafe, and the Pixel 10 could mark Google's adoption of Qi2 through a new feature called \"Pixelsnap.\" A report from Android Authority suggests the Pixel 10 will include the necessary magnets to make Qi2 happen, and will be introduced alongside a lineup of Pixelsnap accessories. Adding some weight to the report, the Wireless Power Consortium has announced that its faster Qi2 25W charging is coming to \"major Android phones.\" It would make sense if Google's Pixel 10s were included. Gemini and other exclusive software features Gemini is Google's current favorite, and the company is pushing the AI assistant everywhere it makes sense. The last few Pixel Drops — Google's regular Pixel-focused software updates — have primarily included Gemini features. It would make sense for Google to include a few more software exclusives on the Pixel 10. Google is hosting the Pixel 10 launch event on August 20 at 1PM ET / 10AM ET. The company has invited press to attend in person, and you can read coverage of everything Google announces right here on Engadget.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/what-to-expect-at-the-google-pixel-10-launch-event-on-august-20-214510264.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Sony is bringing a welcome quality-of-life feature to the PlayStation 5. In the next PS5 system update beta, players will be able to have their DualSense controllers synced with multiple hardware platforms at the same time. That means you could swap a controller from a PS5 to your gaming PC to your smartphone without needing to re-pair the DualSense each time. Up to four devices can be simultaneously paired with a single controller, and each of them will be mapped to one of the action buttons. To switch between them, first make sure the hardware you want to start using is on, then press the controller's PS button and the corresponding action button at the same time. Hold for three seconds, and when you see blinking on the controller's light bar, release both buttons. It's the sort of change that may not carry weight for all players. But for those of us who do like to hop between platforms, this is very exciting news. The current beta access is limited to an invite-only guest list, but Sony said it plans to roll out the feature globally \"in the coming months.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-is-finally-making-it-possible-to-pair-a-dualsense-with-more-than-one-device-211715133.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Palmer Luckey, known for founding Oculus and defense-tech firm Anduril, is now eyeing U.S.-manufactured laptops as his next venture. While past American laptops have largely relied on foreign components, Luckey is exploring the possibility of building a fully \"Made in USA\" device that meets strict FTC standards -- though doing so may cost a premium. Tom's Hardware reports: [\"Would you buy a Made In America computer from Anduril for 20% more than Chinese-manufactured options from Apple?\" asked Luckey in a post on X.] Luckey previously asked the same question at the Reindustrialize Summit, a conference whose website said it was devoted to \"convening the brightest and most motivated minds at the intersection of technology and manufacturing,\" which shared a clip of Luckey discussing the subject, wherein he talks about the extensive research he has already done around building a PC in the U.S. Luckey wouldn't be the first to make a laptop in the U.S. (PCMag collected a list of domestic PCs, including laptops, in 2021.) But those products use components sourced from elsewhere; they're assembled in the U.S. rather than manufactured there. That distinction matters, according to the Made in USA Standard published by the Federal Trade Commission. To quote: \"For a product to be called Made in USA, or claimed to be of domestic origin without qualifications or limits on the claim, the product must be 'all or virtually all' made in the U.S. [which] means that the final assembly or processing of the product occurs in the United States, all significant processing that goes into the product occurs in the United States, and all or virtually all ingredients or components of the product are made and sourced in the United States. That is, the product should contain no -- or negligible -- foreign content.\" How much more would you be willing to pay for a laptop that was truly made in America?

    "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Gizmodo: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Secretary of Health and Human Services, has made a big push to get agencies like the Food and Drug Administration to use generative artificial intelligence tools. In fact, Kennedy recently told Tucker Carlson that AI will soon be used to approve new drugs \"very, very quickly.\" But a new report from CNN confirms all our worst fears. Elsa, the FDA's AI tool, is spitting out fake studies. CNN spoke with six current and former employees at the FDA, three of whom have used Elsa for work that they described as helpful, like creating meeting notes and summaries. But three of those FDA employees told CNN (paywalled) that Elsa just makes up nonexistent studies, something commonly referred to in AI as \"hallucinating.\" The AI will also misrepresent research, according to these employees. \"Anything that you don't have time to double-check is unreliable. It hallucinates confidently,\" one unnamed FDA employee told CNN. [...] Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) commission issued a report back in May that was later found to be filled with citations for fake studies. An analysis from the nonprofit news outlet NOTUS found that at least seven studies cited didn't even exist, with many more misrepresenting what was actually said in a given study. We still don't know if the commission used Elsa to generate that report. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary initially deployed Elsa across the agency on June 2, and an internal slide leaked to Gizmodo bragged that the system was \"cost-effective,\" only costing $12,000 in its first week. Makary said that Elsa was \"ahead of schedule and under budget\" when he first announced the AI rollout. But it seems like you get what you pay for. If you don't care about the accuracy of your work, Elsa sounds like a great tool for allowing you to get slop out the door faster, generating garbage studies that could potentially have real consequences for public health in the U.S. CNN notes that if an FDA employee asks Elsa to generate a one-paragraph summary of a 20-page paper on a new drug, there's no simple way to know if that summary is accurate. And even if the summary is more or less accurate, what if there's something within that 20-page report that would be a big red flag for any human with expertise? The only way to know for sure if something was missed or if the summary is accurate is to actually read the report. The FDA employees who spoke with CNN said they tested Elsa by asking basic questions like how many drugs of a certain class have been approved for children. Elsa confidently gave wrong answers, and while it apparently apologized when it was corrected, a robot being \"sorry\" doesn't really fix anything. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Europe’s deep tech future hinges on evolving investment strategies. The reason for this is that traditional funding models cannot support the long-term financial commitments that innovation demands. There is a European paradox where, despite substantial scientific research, early commercialisation and a focus on shorter-term goals prevent the region from realising the full potential of deep tech. Although startups provide strong support, the sector still lags behind the US and Asia in bringing breakthroughs from the lab to market. To maintain a competitive industry, Europe needs to advance technologies like AI, robotics, synthetic biology, and quantum computing, which are at the…This story continues at The Next Web",

    "description": "Spotify has been hit with another AI controversy after publishing computer-generated songs under the names of dead musicians. An investigation by 404 Media found that Spotify is releasing AI-generated songs on the pages of deceased artists — without approval from their estates or labels.  One such track, “Together,” recently appeared on the official page of Blake Foley, a country singer who was murdered in 1989. The song sounds vaguely similar to Foley’s style, but the accompanying image features a blonde, young man who looks nothing like him.  404 Media linked the track to a company account called Syntax Error, which…This story continues at The Next WebOr just read more coverage about: Spotify",
