    "description": "The implementation of the Corporate Transparency Act -- a law aimed at getting shell companies to disclose their true ownership -- was paused again just days before a reporting deadline was set to take effect, as a federal appeals court handed the case to a panel for further consideration. From a report: In a court filing late Thursday, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated a stay on a national injunction the court had issued Monday that reinstated the Jan. 1 reporting deadline for millions of companies. The lifting of the stay means the January filing deadline will be postponed once again and bars the government and the Treasury Department from enforcing the law, pending oral arguments before the court's so-called merits panel, a group of judges tasked with considering appeals. The Corporate Transparency Act, a bipartisan law passed in 2021 to curtail the use of anonymous shell companies and help track flows of illicit money, would require companies to file beneficial ownership information with the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network or face the possibility of penalties such as fines and jail time. The law could cover more than 32 million small businesses nationwide. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "President-elect Donald Trump has asked the Supreme Court to delay the law that could ban TikTok until after his inauguration. In an amicus brief, Trump‚Äôs attorney D. John Sauer wrote that the future president wants the opportunity to find a solution to the problem ‚Äúthrough political means.‚Äù The law requiring a ban or sale of TikTok is set to take effect on January 19, 2025, just one day before Trump‚Äôs inauguration. The brief calls the ban date ‚Äúunfortunately timed‚Äùand argues the incoming president should have more time to work on a deal with TikTok. TikTok‚Äôs legal team cited a similar concern in its requests for a delay of the ban. The brief also cites Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúdealmaking‚Äù experience and his social media platform Truth Social. ‚ÄúPresident Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government‚Äìconcerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,‚Äù Sauer writes. Trump‚Äôs stance on a TikTok is much different from the one he took in his first term, when he pursued a ban of the app in 2020. He also floated the idea that Microsoft could ‚Äúwork out a deal, an appropriate deal, so the Treasury of the United States gets a lot of money‚Äù without explaining exactly how such a deal would work. President Trump reversed his opinion on a TikTok ban during his second campaign. He told CNBC‚Äôs Squawk Box in March that banning TikTok would ‚Äúmake Facebook bigger and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media.‚Äù The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on the ban on January 10.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/donald-trump-asks-the-supreme-court-to-delay-the-tiktok-ban-235703094.html?src=rss",

    "description": "2023 was the hottest year on record. This past year is on track to beating it and it caused more problems this past year than just spiking thermometers. The World Weather Attribution (WWA) released its annual ‚ÄúExtreme Weather‚Äù report showing how the record-breaking 34.34 Fahrenheit increase in man-made warming from the past year caused ‚Äúunrelenting heatwaves, drought, wildfire, storms and floods.‚Äù The WWA estimates that climate change was responsible for at least 3,700 deaths and 26 weather events in 2024 that led to ‚Äúthe displacement of millions.‚Äù The report recorded a total of 219 events from 2024 that met its ‚Äútrigger criteria‚Äù for identifying impactful weather events. Many of the events were influenced by the natural climate pattern known as El Ni√±o (which has only become stronger under the effects of climate change) but the WWA studies ‚Äúfound that climate change played a bigger role than El Ni√±o in fueling these events, including the historic drought in the Amazon.‚Äù Climate change added on an average 41 additional dangerous heat days and fueled record-breaking rain and flooding across the globe. A study of 16 floods found all but one of them were caused by warming atmospheres that retained more moisture leading to heavier rainfall. These climate conditions can also fuel bigger and deadlier hurricanes and typhoons such as the Helene, the Category 4 Hurricane that hit America in September. North Carolina‚Äôs Office of State Budget and Management estimates that Helene caused $53.8 billion in damage in its state alone. Two of the world‚Äôs most important ecosystems were also ‚Äúhit hard by climate change in 2024,‚Äù according to the WWA report. The Amazon rainforest and the Pantanal Wetland, the largest tropical wetland in the world, experienced severe droughts and wildfires that created ‚Äúhuge biodiversity loss‚Äù in the past year. Both areas are critical for maintaining the strength of the Earth‚Äôs ecosystems, climate and economies. The Amazon‚Äôs plant life removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and releases water into the atmosphere that helps control the climate and circulate ocean currents. The Pantanal Wetland houses tens of thousands of species of wildlife and provides much needed flood control for the region and creates global economic activity for cattle ranching and soy production, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). The WWA‚Äôs report set some critical resolutions for 2025 to combat the rising influence of climate change. The report calls for a ‚Äúfaster shift‚Äù away from fossil fuel usage, improvements in early warning systems for extreme weather events, a greater focus on reporting of heat related deaths and financing for developing countries and regions hit hardest by the effects of climate change.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/2024-is-on-its-way-to-being-the-hottest-year-ever-211524257.html?src=rss",
