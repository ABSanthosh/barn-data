    "description": "TikTok recently began experimenting with an in-app meditation feature that encouraged teens to \"wind down\" after 10PM. Now, the company is making the feature official for all users and turning it on by default for all teens under the age of 18. With the change, teens will hit a full-screen \"guided meditation exercise\" when attempting to scroll after 10PM. The prompt is apparently something you can opt to ignore, but teens who do will encounter a second \"harder to dismiss\" prompt. TikTok's adult users will also be able to access the in-app meditations via the app's screen time controls (the feature will not be on by default for adults). The company notes that its initial tests of \"Sleep Hours\" were successful, with 98 percent of teens opting to keep the late-night meditation settings on. Previous attempts by TikTok to limit screen time have a somewhat different track record. Documents that surfaced as part of a lawsuit against the company showed that teens were spending about 107 minutes a day in the app even when screen time was set to a 60-minute limit. Since then, TikTok has beefed up some of its safety features, including its parental controls, amid increasing scrutiny of the company. TikTok's fate in the US is still, officially, in limbo as President Donald Trump signed off on another extension of a deadline to ban the app last month. Terms of a final deal that will allow it to remain in the country permanently have yet to be announced, though there are a number of interested buyers.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-will-try-to-force-teens-to-meditate-after-10pm-231118942.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Last month, Meta hosted LlamaCon, its first ever generative AI conference. But while the event delivered some notable improvements for developers, it also felt a bit underwhelming considering how important AI is to the company. Now, we know a bit more about why, thanks to a new report in The Wall Street Journal. According to the report, Meta had originally intended to release its \"Behemoth\" Llama 4 model at the April developer event, but later delayed its release to June. Now, it's apparently been pushed back again, potentially until \"fall or later.\" Meta engineers are reportedly \"struggling to significantly improve the capabilities\" of the model that Mark Zuckerberg has called “the highest performing base model in the world.” Meta has already released two smaller Llama 4 models, Scout and Maverick, and has also teased a fourth lightweight model that's apparently nicknamed \"Little Llama.\" Meanwhile, the \"Behemoth\" model will have 288 billion active parameters and \"outperforms GPT-4.5, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and Gemini 2.0 Pro on several STEM benchmarks,\" the company said last month. Meta has never given a firm timeline of when to expect the model. The company said last month that it was \"still training.\" And while Behemoth got a few nods during the LlamaCon keynote, there were no updates on when it might actually be ready. That's probably because it could still be several months. Inside Meta there are apparently questions \"about whether improvements over prior versions are significant enough to justify public release.\" Meta didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. As the report notes, it wouldn't be the first company to run into snags as it races to release new models and outpace competitors. But the delay is still notable given the Meta's lofty ambitions when it comes to AI. Zuckerberg has made AI a top priority with Meta planning to spend as much as $72 billion on its AI infrastructure this year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/metas-behemoth-llama-4-model-might-still-be-months-away-221240585.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney said Thursday that Apple has \"neither accepted nor rejected\" Fortnite's second App Store submission, potentially delaying the game's major update planned for Friday. Epic initially submitted Fortnite on May 9 following Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers' order for Apple to comply with the original 2021 injunction. After five days without response, Epic withdrew and resubmitted to accommodate the upcoming update. While Apple's guidelines state 90% of submissions are reviewed within 24 hours, this silence is unprecedented. The legal context remains complex -- the judge's original ruling didn't require Apple to reinstate Fortnite, as she determined Epic had willingly violated agreed-upon rules. Meanwhile, Sweeney is actively pointing out on X that Fortnite knock-offs are flooding the App Store. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "The FBI has issued a warning that cybercriminals have started using AI-generated voice deepfakes in phishing attacks impersonating senior U.S. officials. These attacks, involving smishing and vishing tactics, aim to compromise personal accounts and contacts for further social engineering and financial fraud. BleepingComputer reports: \"Since April 2025, malicious actors have impersonated senior U.S. officials to target individuals, many of whom are current or former senior U.S. federal or state government officials and their contacts. If you receive a message claiming to be from a senior U.S. official, do not assume it is authentic,\" the FBI warned. \"The malicious actors have sent text messages and AI-generated voice messages -- techniques known as smishing and vishing, respectively -- that claim to come from a senior U.S. official in an effort to establish rapport before gaining access to personal accounts.\" The attackers can gain access to the accounts of U.S. officials by sending malicious links disguised as links designed to move the discussion to another messaging platform. By compromising their accounts, the threat actors can gain access to other government officials' contact information. Next, they can use social engineering to impersonate the compromised U.S. officials to steal further sensitive information and trick targeted contacts into transferring funds. Today's PSA follows a March 2021 FBI Private Industry Notification (PIN) [PDF] warning that deepfakes (including AI-generated or manipulated audio, text, images, or video) would likely be widely employed in \"cyber and foreign influence operations\" after becoming increasingly sophisticated.
