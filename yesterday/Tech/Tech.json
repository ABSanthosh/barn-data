    "description": "The US Department of Commerce on Friday announced its awards for Samsung, Texas Instruments and Amkor Technology under the CHIPS Incentives Program, which come to more than $6.75 billion altogether. The program is meant to help expand domestic semiconductor production. Samsung was awarded up to $4.745 billion in direct funding — a smaller amount than the preliminary award of up to $6.4 billion that was announced earlier this year — while Texas Instruments was granted up to $1.61 billion and Amkor up to $407 million. Samsung plans to invest $37 billion over the next few years to ramp up chip development and production in the US, the DOC said. The company will expand its operations in Texas to include two new production facilities and a site for research and development. It also plans to expand an existing facility in Austin. Texas Instruments is working to build three new facilities — two in Texas and one in Utah — which it’s said it will invest over $18 billion in through 2029. Amkor is planning a $2 billion investment to create an advanced packaging and test facility in Peoria, Arizona. According to Reuters, it’ll be the country’s largest facility of its kind. The Commerce Department says the awards will be doled out as the companies complete certain project milestones. It expects the funding to support the creation of thousands of jobs per project.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/doc-finalizes-semiconductor-awards-totaling-nearly-7-billion-for-samsung-texas-instruments-and-amkor-235749200.html?src=rss",

    "description": "After announcing this week that it furloughed 82 employees, EV startup Canoo emailed remaining workers to inform them they were being placed on a “mandatory unpaid break” and would be locked out of the company’s systems at the end of the day Friday, TechCrunch reports. The email viewed by TechCrunch reportedly said the break would last at least through the end of the year. Canoo announced on Wednesday that it was idling its Oklahoma factories “while it works to finalize securing the capital necessary to move forward with its operations.” Canoo has faced financial difficulties, lawsuits and the departure of multiple executives over the last year. It previously announced it was furloughing 30 employees just this fall. Canoo’s announcement on Wednesday said that the company is now in “advanced discussions with various capital sources.” In a statement about the cuts, Canoo said, “We regret having to furlough our employees, especially during the holidays, but we have no choice at this point. We are hopeful that we will be able to bring them back to work soon.” This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/canoo-put-employees-on-a-mandatory-unpaid-break-after-pausing-work-at-oklahoma-factories-this-week-221912555.html?src=rss",

    "description": "\"More than a decade after the advent of the 3D-printed gun as an icon of libertarianism and a gun control nightmare, police say one of those homemade plastic weapons has now been found in the hands of perhaps the world's most high-profile alleged killer,\" Wired wrote this month: For the community of DIY gunsmiths who have spent years honing those printable firearm models, in fact, the handgun police claim Luigi Mangione used to fatally shoot UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson is as recognizable as the now-famous alleged shooter himself — and shows just how practical and lethal those weapons have become. In the 24 hours since police released a photo of what they say is Mangione's gun following the 26-year-old's arrest Monday, the online community devoted to 3D-printed firearms has been quick to identify the suspected murder weapon as a particular model of printable \"ghost gun\" — a homemade weapon with no serial number, created by assembling a mix of commercial and DIY parts. The gun appears to be a Chairmanwon V1, a tweak of a popular partially 3D-printed Glock-style design known as the FMDA 19.2 — an acronym that stands for the libertarian slogan \"Free Men Don't Ask.\" The FMDA 19.2, released in 2021, is a relatively old model by 3D-printed-gun standards, says one gunsmith who goes by the first name John and the online handle Mr. Snow Makes... Despite its simple description by law enforcement and others as a \"3D-printed pistol,\" the FMDA 19.2 is only partially 3D printed. That makes it fundamentally different from fully 3D-printed guns like the \"Liberator,\" the original one-shot, 3D-printed pistol Wilson debuted in 2013. Instead, firearms built from designs like the FMDA 19.2 are assembled from a combination of commercially produced parts like barrels, slides, and magazines — sometimes sold in kits — and a homemade frame. Because that frame, often referred to as a \"lower receiver\" or \"lower,\" is the regulated body of the gun, 3D-printing that piece or otherwise creating it at home allows DIY gunmakers to skirt gun-control laws and build ghost guns with no serial number, obtained with no background check or waiting period. Chairmanwon \"instantly recognized the gun seized from the suspect...\" reported USA Today. As a photo circulated online the fake New Jersey driver's license and 3D-printed gun police found on Luigi Mangione, he spotted the tell-tale stippling pattern on the firearm's grip. \"It's mine lol,\" the man, known as \"Chairmanwon\" quipped on X Dec. 9. Then he quickly deleted the post... No federal laws ban 3D-printed or privately made firearms. But as police agencies have increasingly recovered untraceable homemade guns at crime scenes, some state legislatures have passed stricter rules... If authorities can prove Mangione downloaded and printed his firearm in Pennsylvania or New York, he could face additional gun charges. Fifteen states now require serial numbers on homemade parts or ban 3D printing them. Some even ban the distribution of 3D printing instructions. President Biden and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives added regulations in 2022 that say the ghost gun parts kits themselves qualify as \"firearms\" that should be regulated by the Gun Control Act. [\"Commercial manufacturers of the kits will have to be licensed and must add serial numbers on the kits' frame or receiver,\" USA Today reported earlier. ] Gunmakers challenged those rules at the Supreme Court. In October, the court heard oral arguments, but justices signaled they were leaning toward upholding the rules. Rolling Stone tries to assess the results: In recent years, crimes involving ghost guns seem to have abated across much of the United States. Ghost gun recoveries by police in New York City, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and other major cities dropped by as much as 25 percent between 2022 and 2023, and the most prolific maker of the kits used to build the untraceable weapons closed its doors this year. The likely cause is a federal rule change requiring the kits to be serialized — a stipulation that forces sellers to conduct background checks on their customers. Monday Luigi Mangione will appear in court for arraignment on state murder charges, reports USA Today: Mangione had been expected to face arraignment on the state charges Thursday, but the proceedings were postponed after federal authorities announced they were also bringing charges, and he was whisked to a federal courthouse instead in a move that appeared to shock Mangione's defense team... Federal authorities unsealed a criminal complaint against Mangione that included four separate charges: murder using a firearm, two counts of interstate stalking and a firearms count. The death penalty was abolished in New York state, but the federal charges could bring a death sentence if Mangione is convicted. The charge of murder using a firearm carries a maximum possible sentence of death or life in prison. The other federal charges have maximum sentences of life in prison, and the firearms charge has a mandatory minimum sentence of 30 years. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "link": "https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/21/0536247/us-life-expectancy-rose-to-784-years-in-2023---highest-level-since-pandemic?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon\u0026utm_medium=feed",
    "description": "An anonymous reader shared this report from NBC News: U.S. life expectancy rose last year, hitting its highest level since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The report, released Thursday, found that life expectancy at birth was 78.4 years in 2023. That's a significant rise — nearly a full year — from the life expectancy of 77.5 years in 2022. \"The increase we had this year — the 0.9 year — that's unheard of prior to the pandemic,\" said Ken Kochanek, a statistician at the National Center for Health Statistics who co-authored the report. \"Life expectancy in the United States never goes up or down any more than one- or two-tenths,\" he said. \"But then when Covid happened, you had this gigantic drop, and now we have a gigantic drop in Covid. So, you have this gigantic increase in life expectancy.\" From 2019 to 2021, U.S. life expectancy dropped from 78.8 years to 76.4. Covid deaths fell significantly last year: Whereas Covid was the fourth leading cause of death in 2022, it was the 10th in 2023, according to the new report. Last year, Covid was the underlying or contributing cause of more than 76,000 deaths, according to an August CDC report, compared with more than 350,000 such deaths in 2020. The new findings are based on an analysis of death certificates from all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The results showed that the overall death rate for the U.S. population decreased by 6%. \"According to the new report, the top five causes of death in the U.S. last year were heart disease, cancer, unintentional injuries, stroke and chronic lower respiratory diseases. Death rates fell for nine of the top 10 causes in 2023, while the rate of cancer deaths remained fairly unchanged...\" The Atlantic shares some other positive statistics, including reports that America's traffic fatalities keep declining, while drug-overdose deaths also dropped 3% between 2022 and 2023 and there was also a double-digit drop in murder rates. \"America is suddenly getting healthier,\" they write. \"No one knows why.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

In order for these big ideas to turn into successful startups, most of them will inevitably come up against the challenges of fundraising.  While there is no magic formula, there are variables that founders can hone in on when engaging with potential investors. TNW sat down with San Francisco-based VC Plug and Play early-stage investor Letizia Royo-Villanova during the Red Bull Basement global final in Tokyo to get her insights.  The one thing that really needs to stand out, according to Royo-Villanova, is the drive and authenticity of the founder.…This story continues at The Next Web",

    "description": "Finnish startup Oura has closed its Series D funding round at $200mn, bringing the smart ring maker’s valuation to a cosy $5.2bn. Oura’s smart ring uses 20 biometric markers to track sleep, physical activity, and stress resilience. The device displays this data on an app that gives you a personalised “readiness” score. We tested the wearable earlier this year and were genuinely impressed.  Founded in 2013, Oura secured its first funding on Kickstarter, the crowdfunding site, in 2016. Counting this new tranche of capital, the tech startup has raised $550mn since inception. “We’ve made significant progress in advancing our mission to make…This story continues at The Next Web",

    "description": "Leo Laporte, Harry McCracken, Christina Warren, and Lou Maresca discuss the evolving relationship between the tech industry and the incoming Trump administration, the future of TikTok in the U.S., advances in AI and its impact on everything from weather forecasting to web browsing, and much more. • Elon Musk and other tech billionaires are playing a major role in shaping President-elect Trump's transition team. The panel debated what this could mean for issues like antitrust regulation of Big Tech. • Trump has named entrepreneur and investor David Sacks as the White House AI and Crypto Czar. Sacks is an Elon Musk ally who has been critical of OpenAI. • The Hak Tuah cryptocurrency project suffered a 90% price crash shortly after launch amid controversy, in what may have been a \"rug pull\" scam. • Trump's pick to lead NASA, private astronaut Jared Isaacman, is expected to push the agency to partner more with SpaceX and the commercial space industry. But his close ties to Elon Musk could face political hurdles. • TikTok's future remains murky as U.S courts uphold a potential ban. The crew discusses the free speech implications and the role of geopolitics. EU also probes TikTok over Russian election interference. • Entrepreneur Frank McCourt's Project Liberty consortium is reportedly advancing a bid to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations, positioning it as a \"people's bid.\" • The U.S. House is set to approve an additional $3 billion to fund the removal of Chinese telecom equipment like Huawei and ZTE from domestic networks. • Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is departing after a challenging 3-year stint. The chip giant's future strategy is up in the air as it faces intensifying competition, but the chip company did outline breakthroughs at a conference in advanced transistors, packaging, and interconnects that could help it regain a manufacturing edge. • OpenAI is running a \"12 Days of OpenAI\" promotion highlighting new AI models and services. The TWiT panel debated whether it's mainly a technical showcase or a monetization push. • Google unveiled a weather forecasting AI model that it says outperforms the leading U.S. and European forecast systems, especially for predicting extreme events. • ElevenLabs launched a beta product that allows users to create and edit entire AI-generated podcast episodes, sparking discussions about the impact on human podcast creators. • With the rise of AI, could we see a new generation of AI-infused web browsers that better understand our behavior? A long blog post by tech guru Om Malik explored the possibilities. • In the wake of China's \"Salt Typhoon\" hacks of telecom networks, the FCC is proposing new cybersecurity rules - but with a twist that would allow law enforcement backdoor access. • In the latest twist in the CSAM scanning saga, Apple is being sued for abandoning the controversial child abuse image detection feature, after previously being pilloried for trying to implement it. • A sleeker, more accurate definition of a \"second\" based on atomic clocks using Strontium instead of Cesium atoms could be coming by 2030, enabling new scientific breakthroughs. • Just in time for Christmas, a pair of the iconic ruby slippers from The Wizard of Oz sold at auction for a whopping $28 million, a new record for movie memorabilia.
