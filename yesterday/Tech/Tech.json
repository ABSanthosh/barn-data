    "description": "A group of researchers covertly ran a months-long \"unauthorized\" experiment in one of Reddit’s most popular communities using AI-generated comments to test the persuasiveness of large language models. The experiment, which was revealed over the weekend by moderators of r/changemyview, is described by Reddit mods as “psychological manipulation” of unsuspecting users. “The CMV Mod Team needs to inform the CMV community about an unauthorized experiment conducted by researchers from the University of Zurich on CMV users,” the subreddit’s moderators wrote in a lengthy post notifying Redditors about the research. “This experiment deployed AI-generated comments to study how AI could be used to change views.” The researchers used LLMs to create comments in response to posts on r/changemyview, a subreddit where Reddit users post (often controversial or provocative) opinions and request debate from other users. The community has 3.8 million members and often ends up on the front page of Reddit. According to the subreddit’s moderators, the AI took on numerous different identities in comments during the course of the experiment, including a sexual assault survivor, a trauma counselor “specializing in abuse,” and a “Black man opposed to Black Lives Matter.” Many of the original comments have since been deleted, but some can still be viewed in an archive created by 404 Media. In a draft of their paper, the unnamed researchers describe how they not only used AI to generate responses, but attempted to personalize its replies based on information gleaned from the original poster’s prior Reddit history. “In addition to the post’s content, LLMs were provided with personal attributes of the OP (gender, age, ethnicity, location, and political orientation), as inferred from their posting history using another LLM,” they write. The r/chnagemyview moderators note that the researchers’ violated multiple subreddit rules, including a policy requiring the disclosure when AI is used to generate comment and a rule prohibiting bots. They say they filed an official complaint with the University of Zurich and have requested the researchers withhold publication of their paper. Reddit also appears to be considering some kind of legal action. Chief Legal Officer Ben Lee responded to the controversy on Monday, writing that the researchers' actions were \"deeply wrong on both a moral and legal level\" and a violation of Reddit's site-wide rules. We have banned all accounts associated with the University of Zurich research effort. Additionally, while we were able to detect many of these fake accounts, we will continue to strengthen our inauthentic content detection capabilities, and we have been in touch with the moderation team to ensure we’ve removed any AI-generated content associated with this research. We are in the process of reaching out to the University of Zurich and this particular research team with formal legal demands. We want to do everything we can to support the community and ensure that the researchers are held accountable for their misdeeds here. In an email, the University of Zurich researchers directed Engadget to the university's media relations department, which didn't immediately respond to questions. In posts on Reddit and in a draft of their paper, the researchers said their research had been approved by a university ethics committee and that their work could help online communities like Reddit protect users from more “malicious” uses of AI.  “We acknowledge the moderators’ position that this study was an unwelcome intrusion in your community, and we understand that some of you may feel uncomfortable that this experiment was conducted without prior consent,” the researchers wrote in a comment responding to the r/changemyview mods. “We believe the potential benefits of this research substantially outweigh its risks. Our controlled, low-risk study provided valuable insight into the real-world persuasive capabilities of LLMs—capabilities that are already easily accessible to anyone and that malicious actors could already exploit at scale for far more dangerous reasons (e.g., manipulating elections or inciting hateful speech).” The mods for r/changemyview dispute that the research was necessary or novel, noting that OpenAI researchers have conducted experiments using data from r/changemyview “without experimenting on non-consenting human subjects.”  “People do not come here to discuss their views with AI or to be experimented upon,” the moderators wrote. “People who visit our sub deserve a space free from this type of intrusion.” Update, April 28, 2025, 3:45PM PT: This post was updated to add details from a statement by Reddit's Chief Legal Officer.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/researchers-secretly-experimented-on-reddit-users-with-ai-generated-comments-194328026.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Wholesome Direct, an annual showcase of cute and cozy games, is returning on Saturday, June 7 at 12PM ET / 9AM PT. This year's event will show off \"a vibrant lineup of artistic, uplifting, and emotionally resonant games from developers of all sizes from around the world,\" according to Wholesome Games' announcement post.  Last year's Wholesome Direct covered over 30 games, including updates to already released titles and the reveal of entirely new games. The definition of \"wholesome\" is generally as broad as event organizer Wholesome Games needs it to be, but Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge from the 2024 Direct is a good example of the kind of game this showcase likes to feature. It's a cute concept (a management game about running a wildlife refuge), has a beautifully illustrated art style and features relaxed, but deep gameplay. Many of the projects that fill out the average Wholesome Direct lineup fit a similar description. Wholesome Games hasn't yet announced which developers will be featured during the Wholesome Direct, but the odds are good that its own Wholesome Games Present publishing label will have some games in the mix. Is This Seat Taken?, a puzzle game about figuring out seating arrangements, doesn't have a release date yet and would be a natural fit for the show. Wholesome Direct 2025 will stream on YouTube and Twitch on June 7 at 12PM ET / 9AM PT. The showcase falls right in the middle of Summer Game Fest, a group of loosely-affiliated game showcases that start airing on June 6, 2025.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/wholesome-direct-2025-will-premiere-on-june-7-214501921.html?src=rss",

    "description": "According to an email posted on Duolingo's LinkedIn, the language learning app will \"gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle.\" Co-founder and CEO Luis von Ahn also said the company will be \"AI-first.\" The Verge reports: According to von Ahn, being \"AI-first\" means the company will \"need to rethink much of how we work\" and that \"making minor tweaks to systems designed for humans won't get us there.\" As part of the shift, the company will roll out \"a few constructive constraints,\" including the changes to how it works with contractors, looking for AI use in hiring and in performance reviews, and that \"headcount will only be given if a team cannot automate more of their work.\" von Ahn says that \"Duolingo will remain a company that cares deeply about its employees\" and that \"this isn't about replacing Duos with AI.\" Instead, he says that the changes are \"about removing bottlenecks\" so that employees can \"focus on creative work and real problems, not repetitive tasks.\" \"AI isn't just a productivity boost,\" von Ahn says. \"It helps us get closer to our mission. To teach well, we need to create a massive amount of content, and doing that manually doesn't scale. One of the best decisions we made recently was replacing a slow, manual content creation process with one powered by AI. Without AI, it would take us decades to scale our content to more learners. We owe it to our learners to get them this content ASAP.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
