    "title": "Why is Threads recommending these weird spammy posts from people looking for 'friends'?",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/social-media/why-is-threads-recommending-these-weird-spammy-posts-from-people-looking-for-friends-234829584.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Threads users have long joked about the sometimes bizarre posts served up by its recommendation algorithm since the early days of the app. Lately though, some users are starting to notice another type of strange post appear in their suggestions: posts from random people looking for \"friends.\" The posts often feature selfies of young people whose profiles claim to be 18. Engadget has observed numerous such posts appearing in Threads' \"related threads\" feature that surfaces recommended content to logged-out users. It’s not clear why these posts are appearing as \"related\" to other popular recommended posts. For example, this post about Spotify from popular Threads user Chris Messina was suggested on Threads’ home feed to logged out users. Clicking into the post surfaced a \"related\" post from Threads head Adam Mosseri. Underneath that post, however, was another \"related\" post from an account claiming to be an 18-year-old girl in 11th grade. Screenshot via Threads For whatever reason, Threads seems to be surfacing many other such posts in its \"related threads\" feature. For example, the following post was also recommended as a \"related\" post elsewhere in the app. A look at this user's profile shows that they have posted the same thing — a photo followed by a WhatsApp link — more than 30 times in the last five days. Screenshot via Threads And here's what Engadget's editor-in-chief Aaron Souppouris was recently recommended as a \"related\" thread\" underneath one of my own posts while logged out.  Screenshot via Threads As Threads has grown to more than 350 million users, it’s not surprising that the platform would see an influx of spam. Meta exec Mosseri said the company had seen an increase in \"spam attacks\" in July of 2023, not long after the service launched. Last year, the company said it was working to get engagement bait under control.  But while the mere presence of spam on a platform the size of Threads isn’t unexpected, it's bizarre that the app is recommending these posts so frequently. Meta didn’t respond to specific questions about these posts or why they are being featured as \"related\" content, but confirmed that spammy posts shouldn't be featured as recommended content in the app.  Notably, spammy posts seem to be appearing as recommendations in other parts of Meta's apps too. One Reddit user recently noticed a strange post that appeared as a recommendation on Instagram. This post featured a selfie of a woman with the words \"I need a bf 🎀 Age don’t mind.\" A quick look at that user's profile shows they've posted dozens of times with that same caption over the last week. “Literally every time the suggested Threads window shows up, I have to scroll through 2-4 posts like this before seeing something normal,\" the Redditor wrote. \"I press ‘not interested’ and report every one I see, but they still keep showing up.\" Screenshot via Threads The post seems to be related to some kind of ongoing spam campaign. The exact same selfie and text flagged by the Redditor was shared by at least one other Threads account. And searches on Threads show numerous other accounts are almost constantly sharing posts saying \"age doesn’t matter\" or \"don’t mind age.\" Have you seen posts like this in your recommendations on Threads?

    "description": "In the latest blow to what was generally a functional government, President Donald Trump wants to eliminate the independent agency in charge of issuing recalls and protecting US citizens from harmful products. The Office of Management and Budget has suggested the responsibilities of the Consumer Product Safety Commission should be folded into \"a nonexistent division within the Department of Health and Human Services,\" according to a joint letter from lawmakers. And to seemingly start the process, Trump has fired the commission's three Democratic members without cause, The Washington Post reports. Following a meeting with the Department of Government Efficiency, Commissioners Mary Boyle and Richard Trumka Jr. received emails on May 8 informing them they'd been fired. A third commissioner, Alexander Hoehn-Saric wasn't formerly fired, but shared via a statement on May 9 that the Acting Chairman of the commission was \"preventing [him] from executing [his] duties.\"  Commissioners in agencies like the CPSC, FCC or the FTC are appointed by the President, approved by the Senate and normally serve out their term in its entirety. Removing a commissioner requires the President to determine that they've neglected their duty or are credibly accused of wrongdoing. See you in court, Mr. President. pic.twitter.com/cSr114Q6gL— Commissioner Rich Trumka Jr. (@TrumkaCPSC) May 9, 2025 That Constitutionally protected standard has not been Trump's concern since he took office. The Democratic members of the FTC say they were illegally fired in a similar fashion back in March, and are now suing the US government. CPSC Commissioner Trumka has announced that he plans to take his case to court, too. The US Supreme Court is considering a case that could determine whether Trump can actually fire members of independent agencies, but until that verdict is reached, we're in limbo. Eliminating the CPSC or at the very least, its Democratic wing, means businesses will receive a lot less scrutiny over the products they sell. Plenty of companies would prefer not to deal with the hassle of recalls and fines. Amazon even proposed in March that the CPSC was too powerful and called the agency \"unconstitutionally constructed.\" Under the Trump administration, those complaints are apparently being heard and acted upon.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trump-plans-to-shut-down-the-consumer-product-safety-commission-214635181.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Huawei has launched its first laptop running HarmonyOS instead of Windows, complete with AI features and support for over 2,000 mostly China-focused apps. The product is largely a result of U.S. sanctions that prevented U.S.-based companies like Google and Microsoft from doing business with Huawei, forcing the company to develop its own in-house solution. Liliputing reports: Early version of HarmonyOS were basically skinned version of Android, but over time Huawei has moved the two operating systems further apart and it now includes Huawei's own kernel, user interface, and other features. The version designed for laptops features a desktop-style operating system with a taskbar and dock on the bottom of the screen and support for multitasking by running multiple applications in movable, resizable windows. Since this is 2025, of course Huawei's demos also heavily emphasize AI features: the company showed how Celia, its AI assistant, can summarize documents, help prepare presentation slides, and more. While the operating system won't support the millions of Windows applications that could run on older Huawei laptops, the company says that at launch it will support more than 2,000 applications including WPS Office (an alternative to Microsoft Office that's developed in China), and a range of Chinese social media applications.

    "description": "Mexico has filed a lawsuit against Google for changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to \"Gulf of America\" for U.S. users on Google Maps, following a Republican-led House vote on Thursday to codify the name change. President Claudia Sheinbaum argues the U.S. only has authority to rename its portion of the continental shelf and warned of legal action unless Google reversed the change. The Guardian reports: \"All we want is for the decree issued by the US government to be complied with,\" Sheinbaum said. \"The US government only calls the portion of the US continental shelf the Gulf of America, not the entire gulf, because it wouldn't have the authority to name the entire gulf,\" she added. In response to Trump, Sheinbaum has cheekily suggested calling the United States \"America Mexicana\" -- Mexican America, pointing to a map dating back to before 1848, when one-third of her country was seized by the United States.
