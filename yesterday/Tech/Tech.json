    "description": "One day after Meta rolled out its standalone AI app, Mark Zuckerberg has shared more about how the company plans to eventually monetize its generative AI assistant. During the company‚Äôs first quarter earnings call, Zuckerberg said Meta AI could one day show ads and product recommendations. He also hinted at plans for a subscription component for those who want a more ‚Äúpremium‚Äù version of the assistant. \"I think that there will be a large opportunity to show product recommendations or ads, as well as a premium service for people who want to unlock more compute for additional functionality or intelligence,‚Äù Zuckerberg said. He added that for now the company is more focused on growing Meta AI‚Äôs usage. (He announced yesterday that Meta Ai had reached ‚Äúalmost‚Äù 1 billion monthly users.) ‚ÄúI expect that we're going to be largely focused on scaling and deepening engagement for at least the next year before we'll really be ready to start building out the business here,‚Äù he said. Zuckerberg‚Äôs comments ‚Äî just one day after Meta introduced its standalone AI app ‚Äî underscores how important the assistant is to the company. The Facebook founder has repeatedly said he wants Meta AI to be the most used AI assistant in the world, and he said on Wednesday‚Äôs call that a standalone app would be particularly important for attracting US users. Meta‚Äôs strategy for monetizing the assistant in many ways mirrors its approach to Threads, which only just began expanding its early experiments with ads this month long after it reached hundreds of millions of users. Speaking of Threads, Zuckerberg also shared some new milestones for Threads, saying that text-based app now has 350 million monthly active users and that time spent on the platform has increased 35 percent over the last six months thanks to improvements to the company‚Äôs recommendations systems. Later in the call, Meta‚Äôs CFO Susan Li shared that the company has also been testing its Llama model to power Threads‚Äô recommendations and that the addition of the large language model has led to a 4 percent increase in time spent. ‚ÄúIt remains early here, but a big focus this year will be on exploring how we can deploy this for other content types, including photos and videos,‚Äù she said.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-a-mulling-ads-and-a-premium-version-of-its-ai-assistant-mark-zuckerberg-says-225202560.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Google has announced that it's helping to financially support the electrical training ALLIANCe (etA), an organization formed by the National Electrical Contractors Association and the International Brotherhood of Electricians. The goal is to train \"100,000 electrical workers and 30,000 new apprentices in the United States\" to meet the growing power demands of AI. Using AI will unlock unspecified, but positive economic opportunities, Google's new white paper, \"Powering a New Era of American Innovation,\" claims. In order to take advantage of them, though, the US power grid needs to become more capable and efficient. That's largely because the data centers used to run and train AI models require vast amounts of energy. The white paper claims that new data centers could demand an additional \"15-90 GW\" of energy by 2030, something that more efficient chips and model training can't account for. For a sense of the scale, the US Department of Energy says 1 Gigawatt is the equivalent to 103 offshore wind turbines.¬† Google's paper calls for investments in alternative energy sources like nuclear power, but also notes that expanding the electrical workforce is necessary. \"McKinsey estimates that 130,000 additional electricians will be needed by 2030 to build out data centers and manufacturing facilities,\" the company writes. Currently, though, retiring electricians outnumber newly trained ones. \"Nearly 10,000 American electricians either retire or change careers each year, while only about 7,000 new entrants join the field.\" Investing in electrical training is Google's attempt to help change that. It would be nice if it was paired with a clearer explanation around what that AI will be doing with all that extra power ‚Äî Google notes that there's a \"causal relationship between energy consumption and economic growth\" ‚Äî but skilled job training isn't a bad thing.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-is-funding-electrician-training-to-help-meet-the-power-demands-of-ai-221320678.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Investigative journalist and cybersecurity expert Brian Krebs reports: A 23-year-old Scottish man thought to be a member of the prolific Scattered Spider cybercrime group was extradited last week from Spain to the United States, where he is facing charges of wire fraud, conspiracy and identity theft. U.S. prosecutors allege Tyler Robert Buchanan and co-conspirators hacked into dozens of companies in the United States and abroad, and that he personally controlled more than $26 million stolen from victims. Scattered Spider is a loosely affiliated criminal hacking group whose members have broken into and stolen data from some of the world's largest technology companies. Buchanan was arrested in Spain last year on a warrant from the FBI, which wanted him in connection with a series of SMS-based phishing attacks in the summer of 2022 that led to intrusions at Twilio, LastPass, DoorDash, Mailchimp, and many other tech firms. The complain against Buchanan is available here (PDF). Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "New submitter LDA6502 writes: The Republican chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is proposing a new annual federal vehicle registration fee of $200 for full EVs, $100 for hybrid EVs, and $20 for combustion vehicles. The tax would be tied to inflation, would be collected by the states, and would expire in 2035. Critics of the proposal note that it could result in low mileage EVs paying a far higher tax rate than heavy ICE trucks and SUVs. Ars Technica notes that the bill \"exempts commercial vehicles, which should see a rush from tax avoiders to register their vehicles under their businesses [...].\" Farm vehicles will also be exempt from the tax. \"The Eno Center for Transportation calculates that this new tax will contribute an extra $110 billion to the highway Trust Fund by 2035 but that cuts to other taxes and more spending mean that the fund will still be $222 billion short of its commitments -- assuming that this added fee doesn't further dampen EV adoption in the U.S., that is.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
