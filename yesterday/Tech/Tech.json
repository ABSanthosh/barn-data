    "description": "It’s a slower October than usual in the tech industry, thanks mostly to Google and Microsoft having held their typical fall hardware announcements earlier this year. Still, we’ve seen a fair number of companies reveal new devices in the last two weeks, while Amazon’s October Prime Day raged on. Whether you were busy shopping or watching Elon Musk talk up robotaxis and cybervans, the Engadget team continued to review recently (and not-so-recently) launched products. As usual, this bi-weekly roundup is here to help you catch up, though because I missed last week's edition (as I was out on time off), the cadence is just a bit off.  From Meta’s Quest 3S VR headset and the DJI Air 3S drone, to Sony’s midrange suite of audio gear, these weeks have coincidentally been about the less premium, more affordable “un-flagships,” if you will. And it turns out you don’t have to throw chunks of your retirement savings at companies to get solid devices that are well worth the money. Sony LinkBuds Fit and LinkBuds Open and Bose QuietComfort Earbuds reviews by Billy Steele The main thing I learned from Billy's recent reviews of Sony and Bose headphones is that flagship, premium-level noise cancelation is making its way down to the midrange products. And I, for one, am happy about it. Looks like most of the things you'll miss if you opt to save some money are features like spatial audio, head-tracking and stuff that's supposed to be make for a more immersive, intuitive listening experience. Personally, I'm okay missing out on those things for now — I really just want decent sound, good voice quality and competent reduction of background noise.  Definitely check out Billy's review of Sony's LinkBuds trio of devices even if you're not in the market for headphones, because he put his ears through literal pain to test the strangely designed earbuds for us. In fact, a rejected headline for the review was \"Why am I in pain?\" We salute you, Billy. Meta Quest 3S review: Impressive VR for $300 by Devindra Hardawar The Quest is arguably the industry's leading VR headset for consumers, especially considering it costs a fraction of alternative options while offering a relatively high-quality immersive experience. Unlike the Apple Vision Pro, which costs $3,500, the new Quest 3S is much more palatable at $300. And, as Devindra observes in his review, it's comfortable, fast and allows wearers to access Meta's large library of VR apps and content. To quote Devindra, \"It’s not Meta’s first $300 VR headset, but it’s still a tremendous accomplishment.\" DJI Neo and DJI Air 3S reviews by Steve Dent Continuing in the trend of excellent products that cost less than usual, the DJI Neo is an excellent drone for just $200. Calling it the best $200 drone ever made may sound hyperbolic, but we truly can't think of any other drone that cost the same that came close to delivering similar performance as the Neo. And though one of its main drawbacks, according to our reviewer Steve, is that it sounds like a banshee, I honestly think that would be a pro for me just for the pure comedy of it all. I never thought I'd be in the market for a banshee-sounding drone but here I am thinking $200 would be a fair price to pay for the aerial videos I could get, and I could easily lay upbeat, operatic singing over the footage anyway.  On the other end of the spectrum, Steve's also tested the higher-end DJI Air 3S drone and Canon's EOS R5 II, both of which will cost you a lot more money. The good news is that Canon's EOS R5 II is now so much improved that it better takes on Sony's rival offerings, while bringing intriguing features like eye-control autofocus. Sure, it's still too early to be reliable. But if you have the money for these premium products, you'll get to experience bleeding-edge tech, maybe part of the appeal is that they may not always work well.  reMarkable Paper Pro review by Dan Cooper I know Dan was a bit worried about giving a device as niche as the reMarkable Paper Pro such a high score, but after some discussion, we both agreed it fit. As it stands, the reMarkable Paper Pro is arguably the best e-paper writing tablet with a color screen, even after this week's announcement of Amazon's first color Kindle. Per Dan's review, the Paper Pro not only levels up with the addition of color, but also got much faster and reliable in the process.  I particularly enjoy how much care has been taken to more seamlessly blend handwriting and typed text for a more natural note-taking and annotating experience. And though it falls outside this edition's general theme of being a less-expensive product with premium specs, I'm still incredibly tempted to find ways to cough up the $600 or so needed to bag myself a Paper Pro with the accessories Dan recommends.  Phoenix Springs and Neva reviews by Jessica Conditt I'm not the most engaged gamer, but I love learning about games from Jess. She recently reviewed sci-fi mystery Phoenix Springs and dreamy platformer Neva, with pieces written so beautifully that I can't help but itch to check out each title so I can feel the way she clearly does about them. Phoenix Springs even follows a technology reporter and covers my favorite genres (science fiction and mystery), while Neva's art looks simply gorgeous. I don't yet know if I'll ever find the time to play new games, but these two have certainly been added to my list. Upcoming reviews: On the horizon The Engadget team geeks out about a multitude of things, and as we get started on our holiday gift guide writing, we're thinking about products we like for ourselves and our loved ones. Many of us love e-readers and writing tablets. I certainly have my eye on one of the new Kindles that were announced this week, particularly the new Kindle Scribe and possibly the Colorsoft. Those won't be available until later this year, so for now I'll keep hungrily eyeing the reMarkable Paper Pro. I'll also be wondering what Amazon hardware chief Panos Panay has up his sleeves, other than cans of Diet Coke — something I learned he (like many people) enjoys when I got the chance to speak with him in an interview this week. Many of us are millennials and have gigantic soft spots for retro gaming. Our executive editor Aaron Souppouris talked to the folks at Analogue, and you can read his beautifully constructed piece to learn more about the upcoming Analogue 3D.  This week, Apple sort of surprised us by announcing the new iPad mini, which has been tweaked to offer more storage and power with an A17 Pro processor. It'll also support Apple Intelligence, of course, and though it seems like a minor update, some of my coworkers and I still love the idea of a small tablet. If only it had a better screen.  All of those recently announced things are on our review roster, alongside things like the Google TV Streamer and Samsung Galaxy S24 FE that launched in the last few weeks. As we approach November and all the holiday shopping that brings, hopefully the hardware launches properly slow down. We're still anticipating an Apple event for Macs, and can still remember being surprised by the announcement of Humane's AI Pin late last year. But for now, we're chugging along while occasionally bathing in nostalgia and longing for a simpler time.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-budget-friendly-gadgets-that-are-good-140033873.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Playing Spilled Mushrooms has been a humbling experience. There I was, thinking I’m good at both puzzles and card games, when I found myself briefly stumped on my very first “delivery” in this card puzzle game about gathering mushrooms. That’s what I get for underestimating a game with cute animals in the cover art. In Spilled Mushrooms, a Playdate game, you are a mushroom delivery-person who has messed up bigtime: you’ve spilled the mushrooms (obviously), and somehow done so in such an extreme way that they’ve ended up scattered across multiple habitats. Oops! You have a week to collect them all and get them to their intended destination. But — in what sounds like my dream scenario — you’ve befriended the wildlife, so you have a support network of animals willing to help you fix your mistake. The game requires some light math and a lot of strategic thinking. Each animal is able to gather a specified number of mushrooms and do so for as many days as are written next to the hourglass symbol on its card. The Hippo, for example, can pick up five mushrooms in one shot, but only for one day. Meanwhile, the Porcupine can only grab one mushroom at a time, but will do so for six days. Each animal also has a unique trait that has potential to interact with the other cards in its habitat. The Moose or Elephant will increase other animals’ collecting capacities while the Grizzly Bear will do the opposite. The Platypus… well, Platypus is confused. As you play, you’ll earn little tokens that can be used to help you stack the deck with cards you want to see in your hand. You can only place one card per turn, and there are three habitats to clear over the course of the seven in-game days that make up a round. Each of those sites will hold a different number of mushrooms. Once I dusted the cobwebs off my brain and got the hang of the game’s flow, I was able to redeem myself and start winning some rounds. But successfully collecting all your mushrooms on the first (... or second) try isn’t a given. The puzzles take a few minutes to solve and they’re procedurally generated, so you’ll get something new every time. Sometimes, they’re pretty hard. Spilled Mushrooms also gives you the option to create a custom delivery, in which you pick the habitats, mushroom counts and available animal cards. Despite the challenge, Spilled Mushrooms is a really relaxing game — and one that I keep getting sucked into for long stretches of time. It’s reminiscent of Wingspan with its nature focus and tranquil soundtrack, so it’s a great thing to pick up when you want to unwind at the end of the day or, conversely, ease yourself into thinking while you have your morning cup of coffee. This one will probably be in my regular rotation of games for a good while.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/spilled-mushrooms-is-my-new-playdate-card-game-addiction-140006678.html?src=rss",

    "description": "\"After two years of being beaten with the memory-safety stick, the C++ community has published a proposal to help developers write less vulnerable code,\" reports the Register. \"The Safe C++ Extensions proposal aims to address the vulnerable programming language's Achilles' heel, the challenge of ensuring that code is free of memory safety bugs...\" Acknowledging the now deafening chorus of calls to adopt memory safe programming languages, developers Sean Baxter, creator of the Circle compiler, and Christian Mazakas, from the C++ Alliance, argue that while Rust is the only popular systems level programming language without garbage collection that provides rigorous memory safety, migrating C++ code to Rust poses problems. \"Rust lacks function overloading, templates, inheritance and exceptions,\" they explain in the proposal. \"C++ lacks traits, relocation and borrow checking. These discrepancies are responsible for an impedance mismatch when interfacing the two languages. Most code generators for inter-language bindings aren't able to represent features of one language in terms of the features of another.\" Though DARPA is trying to develop better automated C++ to Rust conversion tools, Baxter and Mazakas argue telling veteran C++ developers to learn Rust isn't an answer... The Safe C++ project adds new technology for ensuring memory safety, Baxter explained, and isn't just a reiteration of best practices. \"Safe C++ prevents users from writing unsound code,\" he said. \"This includes compile-time intelligence like borrow checking to prevent use-after-free bugs and initialization analysis for type safety.\" Baxter said that rewriting a project in a different programming language is costly, so the aim here is to make memory safety more accessible by providing the same soundness guarantees as Rust at a lower cost. \"With Safe C++, existing code continues to work as always,\" he explained. \"Stakeholders have more control for incrementally opting in to safety.\" The next step, Baxter said, involves greater participation from industry to help realize the Safe C++ project. \"The foundations are in: We have fantastic borrow checking and initialization analysis which underpin the soundness guarantees,\" he said. \"The next step is to comprehensively visit all of C++'s features and specify memory-safe versions of them. It's a big effort, but given the importance of reducing C++ security vulnerabilities, it's an effort worth making.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "A principal security software engineer at Microsoft described how they use their Azure cloud platform \"to hunt phishers at scale,\" in a talk at the information security conference BSides Exeter. Calling himself Microsoft's \"Head of Deception.\" Ross Bevington described how they'd created a \"hybrid high interaction honeypot\" on the now retired code.microsoft.com \"to collect threat intelligence on actors ranging from both less skilled cybercriminals to nation state groups targeting Microsoft infrastructure,\" according to a report by BleepingComputer: With the collected data, Microsoft can map malicious infrastructure, gain a deeper understanding of sophisticated phishing operations, disrupt campaigns at scale, identify cybercriminals, and significantly slow down their activity... Bevington and his team fight phishing by leveraging deception techniques using entire Microsoft tenant environments as honeypots with custom domain names, thousands of user accounts, and activity like internal communications and file-sharing... In his BSides Exeter presentation, the researcher says that the active approach consists in visiting active phishing sites identified by Defender and typing in the credentials from the honeypot tenants. Since the credentials are not protected by two-factor authentication and the tenants are populated with realistic-looking information, attackers have an easy way in and start wasting time looking for signs of a trap. Microsoft says it monitors roughly 25,000 phishing sites every day, feeding about 20% of them with the honeypot credentials; the rest are blocked by CAPTCHA or other anti-bot mechanisms. Once the attackers log into the fake tenants, which happens in 5% of the cases, it turns on detailed logging to track every action they take, thus learning the threat actors' tactics, techniques, and procedures. Intelligence collected includes IP addresses, browsers, location, behavioral patterns, whether they use VPNs or VPSs, and what phishing kits they rely on... The deception technology currently wastes an attacker 30 days before they realize they breached a fake environment. All along, Microsoft collects actionable data that can be used by other security teams to create more complex profiles and better defenses. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "German startup Marvel Fusion and Colorado State University have broken ground on a $150M laser facility in a bid to commercialise fusion energy. Dubbed ATLAS, the facility will use three ultra-high intensity lasers to fire 7 petawatts of power — over 5,000 times the electrical generation capacity of the US — at a target roughly the width of a human hair.   The blast will last approximately 100 quadrillionths of a second. However, it will produce enough heat and pressure to fuse atoms together, initiating the same reaction that powers the Sun and stars.
