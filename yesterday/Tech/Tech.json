    "description": "Microsoft is getting rid of the VPN offered through Microsoft Defender. As spotted by Windows Latest, the company updated its support pages for privacy protection, its built-in VPN, to notify users that the service will end on February 28. The VPN was bundled with Microsoft Defender, which is available to anyone with a personal or family Microsoft 365 subscription, and it offered private browsing by “routing your internet traffic through Microsoft servers,” up to the monthly data limit of 50GB. In a statement about the decision posted on the support page, Microsoft said, “Our goal is to ensure you, and your family remain safer online. We routinely evaluate the usage and effectiveness of our features. As such, we are removing the privacy protection feature and will invest in new areas that will better align to customer needs.” Android users might still see the Microsoft Defender VPN profile in their settings after the expiration date, which they’ll need to remove manually if they want it gone. “Action is not required by Windows, iOS, and macOS users,” Microsoft notes. The company also says this is the only feature getting killed off for now. According to Microsoft, “device protection and identity theft and credit monitoring (US) features will continue.”This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/microsoft-defenders-vpn-feature-will-be-killed-off-at-the-end-of-february-212313322.html?src=rss",

    "description": "The Caesars Superdome will host Super Bowl LXI on Sunday, February 9. Here's how to tune in to the big game! (Photo by Chris Graythen/Getty Images) Chris Graythen via Getty Images Super Bowl LIX is about a week away, and the hype is building for the NFL's final game of the season. The NFC champions the Philadelphia Eagles will face AFC champs — and two-time defending Super Bowl winners — the Kansas City Chiefs. If that roster sounds familiar, it's because it's a rematch of the 2023 Super Bowl, where the Chiefs edged out the Eagles 38-35. Will the Eagles get their revenge this year, or will the Chiefs go where no NFL team has gone before: an unprecedented three straight Super Bowl wins?  Super Bowl LIX will be played at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, LA on Sunday, Feb. 9 with a 6:30 p.m. ET kickoff. The 2025 Super Bowl Halftime Show will feature Kendrick Lamar, who recently confirmed that SZA will be joining him. The championship game will be broadcast nationally on Fox this year and will be available on platforms like DirecTV Stream and Fubo. Looking for a free way to tune in? The Super Bowl will also be livestreamed on Tubi — in 4K, no less! Here’s everything you need to know about how to watch the Super Bowl. When is Super Bowl LIX? The 2025 Super Bowl will be held on Sunday, Feb. 9. What time does the Super Bowl start? Super Bowl LIX kicks off at 6:30 p.m. ET/3:30 p.m. PT. How to watch the Super Bowl live Super Bowl LIX will air nationally on Fox and stream live on Tubi. How to stream the Super Bowl for free this year Tubi will be livestreaming Fox's coverage of the Super Bowl this year — the first time the free platform has done so. It will also be available in the Fox Sports app on mobile platforms. Beyond that, you can also sign up for free trials of DirecTV Stream, Fubo, YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, each of which carry Fox in most locations. Two important caveats: Verify that your locality includes a Fox stream by inputting your ZIP code on their respective sites. And if you don't want to pay, make sure you cancel before the trial subscription ends — they can be as short as three days, so plan ahead. How to watch the 2025 Super Bowl without cable The Tubi option above is the easiest go-to starting point for free Super Bowl streaming — but no one knows how the service will hold up under what's certain to be its most intensive influx of concurrent users. There are plenty of worthwhile backups, each of which offer more comprehensive options for cordcutters beyond the game itself — say, watching SportsCenter on ESPN before or after the game. And most of our picks for best live TV streaming services offer free trials, so you can check them out risk-free. If you time it right, your free trial can include the Super Bowl broadcast, too.  Where is the 2025 Super Bowl? The 2025 Super Bowl will be held at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. The venue has been host to seven previous Super Bowl games. Who is performing in the Super Bowl 59 halftime show? Kendrick Lamar is headlining Super Bowl LIX, with a guest appearance by SZA. Who is playing in the Super Bowl 2025? AFC champions the Kansas City Chiefs will play NFC champs the Philadelphia Eagles. More ways to watch Super Bowl LIX  Thanks to the wide array of streaming options detailed above, you'll be able to watch the Super Bowl on nearly any current device with a screen. There are plenty of Super Bowl TV deals ahead of the game if you need to upgrade that aging 40-inch screen with the dead pixels in the corner. Live close to a broadcast tower of a Fox station? Attach a good old-fashioned over-the-air antenna (like the Channel Master linked above), and you can get the game for free.  Have a fast Internet connection but don't have access to the latest and greatest streaming apps on your TV? For as little as $40 or less, a new Roku or Fire TV device will ensure that you have all of these apps (including Tubi). See our list of best streaming devices for the full range of options.  This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/super-bowl-2025-watch-the-chiefs-vs-eagles-on-sunday-february-9-214817982.html?src=rss",

    "description": "On January 24th Brooklyn blogger Jeffrey Emanuel made the case for shorting NVIDIA, remembers MarketWatch, \"due to a number of shifting tides in the AI world, including the emergence of a China-based company called DeepSeek.\" He published his 12,000-word post \"on his personal blog and then shared it with the Value Investors Club website and across Reddit, X and other platforms.\" The next day he saw 35 people read his post. \"But then the post started to go viral...\" Well-known venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya shared Emanuel's post on Nvidia's short case with his 1.8 million X followers. Successful early stage investor Naval Ravikant shared the post with his 2.6 million followers... Morgan Brown, a vice president of product and growth at Dropbox, pointed to it in a thread that was viewed over 13 million times. Emanuel's own X post got nearly half a million views. He also quickly gained about 13,000 followers on the platform, going from about 2,000 to more than 15,000 followers... [Emanuel] pointed to the fact that so many people in San Jose were reading his blog post. He theorized that many of them were Nvidia employees with thousands — or even millions — of dollars worth of Nvidia stock tied up in employee stock options. With that much money in a single asset, Emanuel speculated that many were already debating whether to hold the stock or sell it to lock in profits. He believes his blog post helped convince some of them to sell. \"A lot of the sell pressure you saw on Monday morning wasn't necessarily what you might think. I believe a fair amount of that was from shares that had never been active because they had been sitting in workplace.schwab.com accounts...\" Emanuel stresses he's \"the most bullish on AI,\" with MarketWatch emphasizing that \"while the points Emanuel laid out in his blog post might be bearish for Nvidia, he still thinks they paint a positive future for AI.\" Nevertheless, Monday NVIDIA's market capitalization dropped $600 billion, which MarketWatch calls \"the largest single-day market-cap drop to date for any company.\" What countless Wall Street firms and investment analysts had seemingly missed was being pointed out by some guy in his apartment.... Matt Levine, the prominent Bloomberg News financial columnist, noted the online chatter that claimed Emanuel's post \"was an important catalyst\" for the stock-market selloff and said it was a \"candidate for the most impactful short research report ever.\" Emanuel spent the rest of the week booked solid as hedge funds paid him $1,000 per hour to speak on the phone and give his take on Nvidia and AI... Emanuel wrote that the industry may be running low on quality data to train that AI — that is, a potential \"data wall\" is looming that could slow down AI scaling and reduce some of that need for training resources... Some of these companies, like Alphabet, have also been investing in building out their own semiconductor chips. For a while, Nvidia's hardware has been the best for training AI, but that might not be the case forever as more companies, such as Cerebras, build better hardware. And other GPU makers like AMD are updating their drivers software to be more competitive with Nvidia... Add all these things together — unsustainable spending and data-center building, less training data to work with, better competing hardware and more efficient AI — and you get a future where it's harder to imagine Nvidia's customers spending as much as they currently are on Nvidia hardware... \"If you know that a company will only earn supersized returns for a couple years, you don't apply a multiple. You certainly don't put a 30-times multiple,\" Emanuel told MarketWatch. The article notes that DeepSeek \"is open-source and has been publishing technical papers out in the open for the past few months... The $5.6 million training-cost statistic that many investors cited for sparking the DeepSeek market panic was actually revealed in the V3 technical paper published on Dec. 26.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Wednesday the Linux Foundation wrote that both \"regulatory compliance\" and \"increased cybersecurity risk\" were \"creating burdens...that must be met\" for open source communities. And so, as Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols writes, \"the Linux Foundation has released a comprehensive guide to help open source developers navigate the complex landscape of the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions...\" These rules, aimed at achieving economic, foreign policy, and national security goals, apply to various interactions, including those in the open source community. The total Sanctions Programs and Country list amounts to over 17 thousand entries ranging from individuals to terrorist organizations to countries. If that rings a bell, it's because, in October 2024, the Linux kernel developers ran right into this issue. The Linux kernel's leadership, including Greg Kroah-Hartman, the stable Linux kernel maintainer, and Linus Torvalds, Linux's founder, announced that eleven Russian kernel developers had been removed from their roles working on the Linux kernel. Why? Because, as Torvalds said, of \"Russian sanctions.\" This, he added, in a Linux kernel mailing list (LKML) message was because \"the 'various compliance requirements' are not just a US thing.\" For developers, this means exercising caution about who they interact with and where their contributions originate. The sanctions target specific countries, regions, and individuals or organizations, many of which are listed on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List... Most OFAC sanctions are exempted for \"informational materials,\" which generally include open source code. However, this only applies to existing code and not to requests for new code or modifications. So, for example, working with a Russian developer on a code patch could land you in hot water... While reviewing unsolicited patches from contributors in sanctioned regions is generally acceptable, actively engaging them in discussions or improvements could cross legal boundaries... Developers are warned to be cautious of sanctioned entities attempting to contribute indirectly through third parties or developers acting \"individually.\" Countries currently sanctioned include: Russia Cuba Iran North Korea Syria The following regions of Ukraine: Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk regions of the Ukraine. The Linux Foundation had written that the OFAC sanctions rules are \"strict liability\" rules, \"which means it does not matter whether you know about them or not. Violating these rules can lead to serious penalties, so it's important to understand how they might affect your open source work.\" But J. Vaughan-Nichols offers this quote from open source licensing attorney Heather Meeker. \"Let's be honest: Smaller companies usually ignore regulations like this because they just don't have the resources to analyze them, and a government usually ignores smaller companies because it doesn't have the resources to enforce against them. Big companies that are on the radar need specialized counsel.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
