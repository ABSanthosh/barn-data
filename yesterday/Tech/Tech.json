    "description": "Black Friday and the holidays are a time for rest, and there are few better ways to unwind and relax by binging a good show or a few movies. The Disney+ and Hulu bundle has a ton of good content, and right now it only costs $36 for a one-year subscription thanks to Black Friday streaming deals. In other words, it’s $3 a month, which is a far cry from its usual $11-per-month price tag. However, only new users or subscribers who canceled their plans at least a month ago are eligible to redeem this discount. If you have an existing Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ or Disney Bundle subscription, the discount won’t apply. This bundle with ads contains content from Disney+ and Hulu. The content is still the same as with ad-free plans, including movies and series like Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine, Frozen, Godmothered and Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, the anticipated Star Wars series only on Disney+. If some of these newer shows aren’t to your liking, there are likely older classics worth your time in the library. The deal runs from November 27 through December 2. After 12 months, the subscription will renew at the regular price if automatic renewal is enabled. Disney+ is one of the best streaming services out there, focusing on providing family-friendly content but also with some more mature content. If you want even more adult-oriented shows and series, Hulu fits the bill. Both have original content as well. There are a number of other Black Friday streaming deals available now as well as part of Black Friday subscription deals. Key among them are discounts on one year of Peacock and six months of Max. Here are more details: Peacock annual subscription for $20 (75 percent off): This Peacock Black Friday deal brings the price of one year of access to the ad-supported tier down to only $20. Note that the subscription will automatically renew at the regular rate after the first year, and the deal is only available to new subscribers who are not currently paying for Peacock. Paramount+ with Showtime two-month subscription for $6 (76 percent off): New and former subscribers can get two months of access to either the ad-supported tier Essentials or the Showtime tier for only $6 in this Paramount+ Black Friday deal. Essential lets you watch on three devices at once, while the premium tier includes access to Showtime originals and ad-free viewing (with the exception of live TV). Max 6-month subscription for $18 (70 percent off): This Max Black Friday deal gives you access to the Ads tier for $3 per month for the first six months, coming out to a total of only $18 for the promo period. New and returning Max subscribers can take advantage of this.

    "description": "Fans of random Love Island spinoffs rejoice! Peacock just dropped a doozy of a Black Friday deal. Customers can now sign up for a year-long subscription to the streaming service for just $20 or six months at $2 per month. That’s a discount of 75 percent, no matter which option is selected. The promotion is live right now, but ends on December 2. Peacock doesn’t have the name recognition of Netflix or Hulu, but it’s still home to plenty of good shows and movies. There’s a reason, after all, that the platform made our list of the best streaming services. Peacock isn’t just home to the aforementioned Love Island and other reality shows about love not set on islands. The streamer also airs some top-notch content like the AI-centric Mrs. Davis and the surprisingly-decent video game adaptation Twisted Metal. A Peacock subscription also allows access to SyFy shows like the underrated The Ark. Other worthwhile programs include Hysteria!, We Are Lady Parts and Killing It. There are a few little caveats. First, this subscription is the one with ads. Also, the offer is only available to new subscribers who are not currently paying for Peacock Premium or Premium Plus. Finally, it’s only available directly from Peacock, and not from third-party billers like Apple or Amazon.

    "description": "\"Polar oceans constitute emission hotspots during the summer,\" according to a new paper published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Science Advances. \"And including those sea-to-air fluxes in an atmospheric chemistry-climate model \"results in a net radiative effect that has far-reaching implications.\" The research was led by a team of scientists from Spain's Institute of Marine Sciences and the Blas Cabrera Institute of Physical Chemistry, according to an announcement from the UK's University of East Anglia: Researchers have quantified for the first time the global emissions of a sulfur gas produced by marine life, revealing it cools the climate more than previously thought, especially over the Southern Ocean. The study, published in the journal Science Advances, shows that the oceans not only capture and redistribute the sun's heat, but produce gases that make particles with immediate climatic effects, for example through the brightening of clouds that reflect this heat. It broadens the climatic impact of marine sulfur because it adds a new compound, methanethiol, that had previously gone unnoticed. Researchers only detected the gas recently, because it used to be notoriously hard to measure and earlier work focussed on warmer oceans, whereas the polar oceans are the emission hotspots... Their findings represent a major advance on one of the most groundbreaking theories proposed 40 years ago about the role of the ocean in regulating the Earth's climate. This suggested that microscopic plankton living on the surface of the seas produce sulfur in the form of a gas, dimethyl sulphide, that once in the atmosphere, oxidizes and forms small particles called aerosols. Aerosols reflect part of the solar radiation back into space and therefore reduce the heat retained by the Earth. Their cooling effect is magnified when they become involved in making clouds, with an effect opposite to, but of the same magnitude as, that of the well-known warming greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide or methane. The researchers argue that this new work improves our understanding of how the climate of the planet is regulated by adding a previously overlooked component and illustrates the crucial importance of sulfur aerosols. They also highlight the magnitude of the impact of human activity on the climate and that the planet will continue to warm if no action is taken. The article includes this quote from one of the study's lead authors (Dr. Charel Wohl from the university's Centre for Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences). \"Climate models have greatly overestimated the solar radiation actually reaching the Southern Ocean, largely because they are not capable of correctly simulating clouds. The work done here partially closes the longstanding knowledge gap between models and observations.\" And the university's announcement argues that \"With this discovery, scientists can now represent the climate more accurately in models that are used to make predictions of +1.5 degrees C or +2 degrees C warming, a huge contribution to policy making.\" Thanks to long-time Slashdot reader schwit1 for sharing the news.
