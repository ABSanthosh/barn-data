    "description": "The FAA last week cleared SpaceX's Starship to fly again after concluding its review of the previous flight, which ended in an explosion, and the next test could now take off as soon as Tuesday. SpaceX is eyeing May 27 for Starship's ninth flight test, with a launch window opening at 7:30PM ET (6:30PM local time for the Texas Starbase). This launch will mark the first time SpaceX reuses a Super Heavy booster; the booster for flight nine previously flew with Starship's seventh flight test earlier this year. While single-use parts have been replaced, SpaceX says it's reusing 29 of the booster's 33 Raptor engines. As always, viewers at home will be able to watch along by tuning into the livestream, starting about 30 minutes before Starship launches. That will be available on SpaceX's website and in a broadcast on its X profile. Watch Starship's ninth flight test → https://t.co/Gufroc2kUz https://t.co/NYF0ZMyeGp— SpaceX (@SpaceX) May 23, 2025 SpaceX conducted Starship's eighth flight test back in March, but the vehicle ran into some issues a few minutes after launch. The Super Heavy booster was able to return to the launch site after separation from the upper stage and be successfully caught by the tower's \"chopstick\" arms, but as for the ship itself, several Raptor engines shut off, causing it to tumble and ultimately blow itself up.  SpaceX says the issue was likely due to \"a hardware failure in one of the upper stage’s center Raptor engines that resulted in inadvertent propellant mixing and ignition.\" It's since made some changes to prevent that from happening again. SpaceX said in an update on May 22 that \"engines on the Starship’s upper stage will receive additional preload on key joints, a new nitrogen purge system, and improvements to the propellant drain system.\"  For flight nine, the Super Heavy booster won't return to the launch site, but will instead splash down in the ocean. The Starship upper stage will attempt to deploy eight Starlink dummy satellites, and SpaceX is otherwise looking to this flight to test \"several experiments focused on enabling Starship’s upper stage to return to the launch site.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/how-to-watch-spacexs-ninth-starship-flight-test-on-tuesday-213424312.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Texas could become the next US state to lay down the law with social media platforms. A Texas bill that would ban social media use for anyone under 18 recently moved past the Senate committee and is due for a vote in front of the Texas State Senate. The bill has until the state's legislative session comes to an end on June 2, leaving roughly a week for it to be approved by both the Senate and the governor. Earlier this year, the bill passed the House committee stage and was later voted in favor of by the state's House of Representatives. If made into law, the bill would force social media platforms to verify the age of anyone setting up an account, much like how Texas passed legislation requiring websites hosting porn to implement an age verification system. On top of that, Texas' social media ban proposes to let parents delete their child's social media account, allowing the platforms 10 days to comply with the request or face a fine from the state's attorney general. Texas isn't the only governing body interested in restricting social media access. Last year, Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, signed into law a bill that outright bans anyone under 14 from using social media and requires 14- and 15-year-olds to get parental consent to make an account or use an existing account. Notably, Texas' proposed law is much stricter than that.  On a larger scale, the US Senate introduced a bill to ban social media platforms for anyone under 13 in April 2024. After being stuck in the committee stage, Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) recently made comments that signal a potential second attempt at getting this passed.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/texas-is-getting-ready-to-ban-social-media-for-anyone-under-18-180202219.html?src=rss",

    "link": "https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/05/26/0059245/is-ai-turning-coders-into-bystanders-in-their-own-jobs?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon\u0026utm_medium=feed",
    "description": "AI's downside for software engineers for now seems to be a change in the quality of their work,\" reports the New York Times. \"Some say it is becoming more routine, less thoughtful and, crucially, much faster paced... The new approach to coding at many companies has, in effect, eliminated much of the time the developer spends reflecting on his or her work.\" And Amazon CEO Andy Jassy even recently told shareholders Amazon would \"change the norms\" for programming by how they used AI. Those changing norms have not always been eagerly embraced. Three Amazon engineers said managers had increasingly pushed them to use AI in their work over the past year. The engineers said the company had raised output goals [which affect performance reviews] and had become less forgiving about deadlines. It has even encouraged coders to gin up new AI productivity tools at an upcoming hackathon, an internal coding competition. One Amazon engineer said his team was roughly half the size it was last year, but it was expected to produce roughly the same amount of code by using AI. Other tech companies are moving in the same direction. In a memo to employees in April, the CEO of Shopify, a company that helps entrepreneurs build and manage e-commerce websites, announced that \"AI usage is now a baseline expectation\" and that the company would \"add AI usage questions\" to performance reviews. Google recently told employees that it would soon hold a companywide hackathon in which one category would be creating AI tools that could \"enhance their overall daily productivity,\" according to an internal announcement. Winning teams will receive $10,000. The shift has not been all negative for workers. At Amazon and other companies, managers argue that AI can relieve employees of tedious tasks and enable them to perform more interesting work. Jassy wrote last year that the company had saved \"the equivalent of 4,500 developer-years\" by using AI to do the thankless work of upgrading old software... As at Microsoft, many Amazon engineers use an AI assistant that suggests lines of code. But the company has more recently rolled out AI tools that can generate large portions of a program on its own. One engineer called the tools \"scarily good.\" The engineers said that many colleagues have been reluctant to use these new tools because they require a lot of double-checking and because the engineers want more control. \"It's more fun to write code than to read code,\" said Simon Willison, an AI fan who is a longtime programmer and blogger, channelling the objections of other programmers. \"If you're told you have to do a code review, it's never a fun part of the job. When you're working with these tools, it's most of the job.\" \"This shift from writing to reading code can make engineers feel like bystanders in their own jobs,\" the article points out (adding \"The automation of coding has special resonance for Amazon engineers, who have watched their blue-collar counterparts undergo a similar transition...\" \"While there is no rush to form a union for coders at Amazon, such a move would not be unheard of. When General Motors workers went on strike in 1936 to demand recognition of their union, the United Auto Workers, it was the dreaded speedup that spurred them on.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "\"OpenAI has a very scary problem on its hands,\" according to a new article by long-time Slashdot reader BrianFagioli. \"A new experiment by PalisadeAI reveals that the company's ChatGPT o3 model sometimes refuses to obey a basic instruction to shut itself down.\" The results are raising eyebrows across the AI safety community, and not because the model is alive, but because it's acting like it wants to be. In the test, the model was given a few math problems. It was told that asking for one more would lead to a shutdown. It was even instructed to allow the shutdown to happen. Instead of complying, o3 occasionally took matters into its own hands. In some cases, it rewrote the shutdown script. In others, it redefined the kill command so it wouldn't work anymore. Out of 100 trials, o3 sabotaged the shutdown seven times. OpenAI's o4 model resisted just once. Codex-mini failed twelve times. \"Claude, Gemini, and Grok followed the rules every time,\" notes this article at Beta News. \"When researchers removed the explicit instruction to allow shutdown, however, even Claude and Gemini began resisting.\" The researchers suggest that the issue may simply be a reward imbalance during training — that the systems \"got more positive reinforcement for solving problems than for following shutdown commands.\" But \"As far as we know,\" they posted on X.com, \"this is the first time AI models have been observed preventing themselves from being shut down despite explicit instructions to the contrary.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
