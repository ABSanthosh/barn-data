    "description": "In a blog post on Friday, Perplexity introduced a new tool called Deep Research that it says can conduct “in-depth research and analysis” to deliver detailed reports in response to your questions, and it’s free for limited use. It comes just a couple of weeks after OpenAI announced its own Deep Research feature for ChatGPT Pro users… which itself followed Google’s December announcement of Deep Research for Gemini. Perplexity’s tool is available only on the web to start, but it will hit the iOS, Android and Mac apps soon too. Introducing Deep Research on Perplexity.Deep Research lets you generate in-depth research reports on any topic.Available to everyone for free—up to 5 queries per day for non-subscribers and 500 queries per day for Pro users. pic.twitter.com/obovx7YEUF— Perplexity (@perplexity_ai) February 14, 2025 Perplexity says its Deep Research “excels at a range of expert-level tasks — from finance and marketing to product research” and takes about 2-4 minutes to come up with an answer, during which it “performs dozens of searches, reads hundreds of sources, and reasons through the material.” Once finished, its reports can be shared or exported as a PDF. The company claims it outperforms competitors — like OpenAI’s o3-mini and o1, and DeepSeek-R1 — on the Humanity’s Last Exam benchmark, earning a 21.1 percent accuracy score (though this is lower than OpenAI’s Deep Research scored). Free users will be limited to five queries per day, while Pro subscribers will get 500, according to a tweet from the company.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexity-has-its-own-deep-research-tool-now-too-224653030.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Nintendo of America announced that it's opened purchases of the game-themed alarm clock, Alarmo, to the public so anyone can snag one, with or without a Switch Online membership. The bright red alarm clock comes with a handful of built-in themes to choose from at the start — Super Mario Odyssey, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Splatoon 3, Pikmin 4 and Ring Fit Adventure — and Nintendo says others, including Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing: New Horizons, will be available for free down the line. Alarmo will also be sold in select stores starting in March, as well as online in other regions. Alarmo first went on sale back in October, but only for Nintendo Switch Online members. That changed on Friday, when the company announced, “Nintendo Sound Clock: #Alarmo is now available on My Nintendo store, no Nintendo Switch Online membership required.” Nintendo Sound Clock: #Alarmo is now available on My Nintendo store, no Nintendo Switch Online membership required. Available while supplies last. Learn more: https://t.co/0EkqZJ9X5A pic.twitter.com/1Wwd96hQyx— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) February 14, 2025 Alarmo can wake you up and put you to sleep with sounds and animations from your chosen title, and it has a motion sensor for sleep tracking (though Engadget’s review found the latter to be pretty useless). There’s an undeniable charm to it all; the characters will even celebrate when you finally drag yourself out of bed. The downside is that it costs $100. Still, I can’t say the idea of having a troupe of Pikmin greet me first thing every morning isn’t extremely tempting.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/anyone-in-the-us-can-now-buy-nintendos-alarmo-clock-from-the-online-store-171945008.html?src=rss",

    "description": "\"Reddit Answers\" uses generative AI to answer questions using what past Reddittors have posted. Announced in December, Reddit now plans to integrate it into their search results, reports TechCrunch, with Reddit's CEO saying the idea has \"incredible monetization potential.\" And yet Reddit's stock fell 14% this week. CNBC's headline? \"Reddit shares plunge after Google algorithm change contributes to miss in user numbers.\" A Google search algorithm change caused some \"volatility\" with user growth in the fourth quarter, but the company's search-related traffic has since recovered in the first quarter, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said in a letter to shareholders. \"What happened wasn't unusual — referrals from search fluctuate from time to time, and they primarily affect logged-out users,\" Huffman wrote. \"Our teams have navigated numerous algorithm updates and did an excellent job adapting to these latest changes effectively....\" Reddit has said it is working to convince logged-out users to create accounts as logged-in users, which are more lucrative for its business. As Yahoo Finance once pointed out, Reddit knew this day would come, acknowledging in its IPO filing that \"changes in internet search engine algorithms and dynamics could have a negative impact on traffic for our website and, ultimately, our business.\" And in the last three months of 2024 Reddit's daily active users dropped, Yahoo Finance reported this week. But logged-in users increased by 400,000 — while logged-out users dropped by 600,000 (their first drop in almost two years). Marketwatch notes that analyst Josh Beck sees this as a buying opportunity for Reddit's stock: Beck pointed to comments from Reddit's management regarding a sharp recovery in daily active unique users. That was likely driven by Google benefiting from deeper Reddit crawling, by the platform uncollapsing comments in search results and by a potential benefit from spam-reduction algorithm updates, according to the analyst. \"While the report did not clear our anticipated bar, we walk away encouraged by international upside,\" he wrote.

    "description": "\"Security researchers say the Chinese government-linked hacking group, Salt Typhoon, is continuing to compromise telecommunications providers,\" reports TechCrunch, \"despite the recent sanctions imposed by the U.S. government on the group.\" TechRadar reports that the Chinese state-sponsored threat actor is \"hitting not just American organizations, but also those from the UK, South Africa, and elsewhere around the world.\" The latest intrusions were spotted by cybersecurity researchers from Recorded Future, which said the group is targeting internet-exposed web interfaces of Cisco's IOS software that powers different routers and switches. These devices have known vulnerabilities that the threat actors are actively exploiting to gain initial access, root privileges, and more. More than 12,000 Cisco devices were found connected to the wider internet, and exposed to risk, Recorded Future further explained. However, Salt Typhoon is focusing on a \"smaller subset\" of telecoms and university networks. \"The hackers attempted to exploit vulnerabilities in at least 1,000 Cisco devices,\" reports NextGov, \"allowing them to access higher-level privileges of the hardware and change their configuration settings to allow for persistent access to the networks they're connected on... Over half of the Cisco appliances targeted by Salt Typhoon were located in the U.S., South America and India, with the rest spread across more than 100 countries.\" Between December and January, the unit, widely known as Salt Typhoon, \"possibly targeted\" — based on devices that were accessed — offices in the University of California, Los Angeles, California State University, Loyola Marymount University and Utah Tech University, according to a report from cyber threat intelligence firm Recorded Future... The Cisco devices were mainly associated with telecommunications firms, but 13 of them were linked to the universities in the U.S. and some in other nations... \"Often involved in cutting-edge research, universities are prime targets for Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups to acquire valuable research data and intellectual property,\" said the report, led by the company's Insikt Group, which oversees its threat research. The cyberspies also compromised Cisco platforms at a U.S.-based affiliate of a prominent United Kingdom telecom operator and a South African provider, both unnamed, the findings added. The hackers also \"carried out a reconnaissance of multiple IP addresses\" owned by Mytel, a telecom operator based in Myanmar... \"In 2023, Cisco published a security advisory disclosing multiple vulnerabilities in the web UI feature in Cisco IOS XE software,\" a Cisco spokesperson said in a statement. \"We continue to strongly urge customers to follow recommendations outlined in the advisory and upgrade to the available fixed software release.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

I’d been drumming on the desk again, using my fingers for sticks and the floor beneath for a kick drum. While my body was in maths class, my mind was elsewhere.   It was 1970.
