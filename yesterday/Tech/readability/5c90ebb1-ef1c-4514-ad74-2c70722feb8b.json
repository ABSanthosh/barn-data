  "text": "Giving a new name to family ride at Universal Studios Hollywood will be the theme park’s first major thrill rollercoaster inspired by The Fast and the Furious franchise. Height requirements are pending, sorry kids! The West Coast’s love for adrenaline-packed car races and theme parks combines in Fast \u0026 Furious: Hollywood Drift—Universal’s fastest “drifting” coaster with a speed of 72 MPH. The ride is set to open sometime next year, and construction is well underway for it with the tracks hugging the hillside of the upper lot of Universal Studios Hollywood. Boasting a 360-degree rotation on each one of the ride vehicles, the coaster will turn the proverbial NOS up to get the cars to reach that 72 MPH on 4,100 feet of outdoor track with the real streets of LA from the films as the backdrop. The cinematic experience is meant to evoke the car culture that inspired the films, making you feel like a part of the crew led by Vin Diesel and co-starring Michelle Rodriguez, the late Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese, Ludacris, Sung Kang, John Cena, and more. Watch the video below that showcases the coaster vehicles replicating the Toretto family’s signature driving moves throughout the blockbuster global heist films. The ride is set to replace the Studio Tour’s representation of the hit franchise films, the now defunct attraction Fast \u0026 Furious Supercharged, which featured Dwyane Johnson and Luke Evans. The storyline for the coaster is firmly under wraps but to tide fans over they can check out one of the ride vehicles modeled after Dominic Toretto’s 1970 Dodge Charger on display at Universal Studios Hollywood. Fast \u0026 Furious: Hollywood Drift opens in 2026. Want more io9 news?
