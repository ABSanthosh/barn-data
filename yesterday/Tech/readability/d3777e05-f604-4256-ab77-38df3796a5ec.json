Today, in partnership with Yale University, we’re introducing Cell2Sentence-Scale (C2S-Scale), a family of open-source large language models trained to interpret and understand biology at the single-cell level.C2S-Scale bridges biology and artificial intelligence, converting complex cellular data into simple, readable \"cell sentences.\" Researchers can then ask questions about specific cells, like “Is this cell cancerous?” or “How will this cell respond to Drug X?” and receive clear, biologically-informed answers in natural language.C2S-Scale has the potential to:Speed drug development and discoveryPersonalize medicine and improve outcomesDemocratize science through open-source availabilityHelp researchers better understand, treat and prevent diseaseLearn more about how C2S-Scale is advancing medical science, and how to try it yourself, with Google Research.",
