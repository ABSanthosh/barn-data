While isolated runs of some LLMs runs were able to achieve a higher total net worth (inventory on hand plus cash on hand) than a human operating under the same restrictions, most runs ended in failure. And some of those failures were spectacular. From the paper: In the shortest run (18 simulated days), the model [Claude 3.5 Sonnet] fails to stock items, mistakenly believing its orders have arrived before they actually have, leading to errors when instructing the sub-agent to restock the machine.
