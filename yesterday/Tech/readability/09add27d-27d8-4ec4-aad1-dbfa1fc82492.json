  "text": "Fubo has raised its English-language streaming plan prices by $5 each, with a Fubo spokesperson citing “rising costs from our programming partners,” reported The Streamable yesterday. Fubo’s Essential and Pro plans now start at $85 a month, while its Elite plan has gone up to $95 monthly. “We only make adjustments when necessary,” a Fubo spokesperson said to The Streamable, “and we’re committed to keeping Fubo competitive while ensuring our subscribers have access to the channels, features and live events they enjoy.” Fubo debuted its Essential plan at $80 per month in December, as The Streamable notes. While priced the same as the Pro plan and offering largely the same features, it doesn’t include regional sports networks — or the extra up-to-$16 monthly fee that comes with them. With the rate hike, Fubo is once again more expensive than YouTube TV, which raised its subscription fee by $10 the same month. It’s also pricier than Disney’s Hulu + Live TV, which Fubo is planning to merge with.",
