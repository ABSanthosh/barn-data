  "text": "SAVE $50: As of March 29, the brand-new 2025 MacBook Air with M4 chip is available for $949 at Amazon. That’s $50 off its regular price of $999. I don’t know who’s asleep at the wheel over at Amazon, but they’ve got the just-released 2025 MacBook Air with the M4 chip sitting pretty at $949. Yes, already. Yes, somehow still in stock. This is the kind of deal that feels like it should come with a countdown timer and dramatic music.Apple just announced the M4 chip, and we’re already getting a discount on a MacBook that has it baked in. This version comes with 16GB of memory and 256GB of SSD storage—aka the sweet spot for anyone who wants a laptop that won’t flinch when you open five apps and 28 tabs at once. It’s fast, smooth, and just obnoxiously good at everything. The design hasn’t changed much from last year’s MacBook Air, but when something already looks this sleek and weighs practically nothing, I’m not complaining. The Midnight finish? Gorgeous. The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display? Still serving up a billion colors like it’s trying to show off.Apple also upgraded the webcam to a 12MP Center Stage camera, which is perfect for video calls where you want to look like you have your life together. Add in three mics, four speakers, and Spatial Audio, and you’re basically set to produce a podcast without trying.
