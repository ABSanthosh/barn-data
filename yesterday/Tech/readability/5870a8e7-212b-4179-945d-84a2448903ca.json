  "text": "We all saw what happened after the credits of Thunderbolts. We jumped ahead a few months into the world of Avengers: Doomsday, and in a scene directed by Doomsday helmers Joe and Anthony Russo, Yelena and the rest of the New Avengers saw something very unique flying toward Earth. The movie is pretty upfront with what it wants us to think that is, but in a new interview, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige is making us second-guess ourselves. As we’ve discussed previously, in the end credits scene, New Avengers get word of an “extra-dimensional” ship entering Earth’s atmosphere and see a ship with a giant “4” on the side flying through space. This is accompanied by a few notes of Michael Giacchino’s score to The Fantastic Four: First Steps, the only Marvel movie coming out between Thunderbolts and Doomsday. And, since all of the Fantastic Four and all of the New Avengers are in Doomsday, it doesn’t take a genius to connect the dots. This is the Fantastic Four leaving their dimension and coming into the MCU. Or is it? Speaking in Empire Magazine (with a quote that isn’t online yet but is apparently in print), Feige said the following in regards to the Thunderbolts/New Avengers end credits scene. “Their ship is the Excelsior, and there is a Fantastic Four ship entering the MCU … But I’m not sure they’re the same ship,” Feige said. Which means one of two things. One, Feige is just being Feige and trying to make people argue and debate about his movies with his trademark vague but admittedly fun statements. Or, two, he’s giving us a new, crucial piece of the puzzle. For the record, we’re guessing it’s the first one. Clearly, Feige loves messing with us and sparking debate. He’s been doing it for years and is all but impossible to get a straight answer out of, especially in terms of future movies. If there is any doubt about something, Feige will lean into it. So while the most obvious implication is that this is the Fantastic Four, we do not see any of the characters. There is, if you want to be literal, a bit of a grey area there. For argument’s sake, let’s say Feige’s implications are real. This is a ship owned by or related to the Fantastic Four, but they aren’t on it. What else could be happening? Maybe a character has stolen one of their ships? Maybe this is a later piece of the story and it’s being sent empty for another reason? Or, is this a whole other multiversal Fantastic Four team? There are a million potential explanations, any one of which could be true. Or, because Yelena doesn’t know what she’s watching, because their computer system isn’t aware of it, because we see the “4” and because we hear the music, it is indeed the Fantastic Four. Which way are you leaning? If Feige messing with us or setting us on the right path? Do you think we’ll find out in Fantastic Four: First Steps or will we have to wait till December 2026 and Avengers: Doomsday? Let us know below. Want more io9 news?
