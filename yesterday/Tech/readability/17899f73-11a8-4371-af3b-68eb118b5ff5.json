The country was praised for its thriving digital economy, mature biotech and semiconductor industries, and strong digital skills underpinned by “engineering excellence.” London-based Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) and consultancy SThree produced the index, which ranks 35 countries based on economic indicators such as level of high-tech exports, number of software developers, and patent filings related to AI.  Several European countries joined the Netherlands near the top of the rankings. Ireland placed second globally and first in Europe, while Finland (fourth), Norway (sixth), Denmark (seventh), Estonia (eighth), and Sweden (ninth) also featured in the top 10. Singapore claimed the number one position overall, earning praise for its “world-class” digital infrastructure, advanced STEM education, and innovation-driven economy. All the metrics are adjusted for population size.   The UK and US lagged behind at 13th and 15th, respectively, underscoring the shifting dynamics of global tech competitiveness. Notably, G7 economies failed to secure a single position in the top 10. The study excluded India, China, and every African nation due to insufficient data.   The 20 leading nations for tech competitiveness.

Switzerland led this index, followed by Sweden, while the Netherlands secured eighth place. The full rankings for STEM competitiveness. Credit: SThree/CEBR Positive signs for tech in the Netherlands The report highlighted the Netherlands’ strength in life sciences, where it ranked seventh, supported by a thriving ecosystem of biotech startups and a strong network of research institutions. Engineering emerged as the country’s weakest STEM sector, ranking 21st globally. The findings suggest there are grounds for optimism about the Dutch tech sector, despite recent heavy criticism. A recent report discovered a “worrying” decline in startups from the country, while founders have warned that burdensome regulation and insufficient government support are stunting the sector’s progress. The report also illustrates the outsized role played by Europe’s smaller countries in nurturing science and technology.  Timo Lehne, the chief executive of SThree, said the rankings also stand as a clear warning sign for the G7 nations — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US. “Once the global epicentre for innovation, these countries are now facing stiff competition from emerging tech hubs,” he said. “Without a renewed focus on cultivating groundbreaking companies and embracing future-facing industries, their leadership in the tech race is no longer guaranteed.” The future of Dutch tech will be a hot topic at TNW Conference, which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.
