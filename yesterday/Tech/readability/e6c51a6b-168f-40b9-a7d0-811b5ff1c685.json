  "text": "After teasing the device in January at Unpacked 2025, Samsung is ready to make the Galaxy S25 Edge official. The company revealed latest device in the S25 series during a special Monday night event. While there are many similarities between the Edge and the other S25 devices, what makes this particular model stand out from the rest is how slim it is: The S25 Edge is just 5.8mm thick, 1.4mm thinner than the standard S25, and Samsung's thinnest phone yet. Everything Samsung revealed about the S25 EdgeJust like the rest of the S25 phones, the new Galaxy S25 Edge is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip. That SoC (system on a chip) brings a number of improvements to the entire S25. According to Qualcomm, that includes a 45% boost in performance, and a 44% better power efficiency when compared to the S24's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy. The chip also includes a new Adreno GPU which Qualcomm says adds a 40% performance boost over the previous generation. There's also 12GB of RAM and either 256GB or 512GB of internal storage. The S25 Edge features a 6.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display, with a QHD+ screen resolution of 3120 x 1440 that supports an adaptive refresh rate. That means the display can refresh anywhere from one to 120Hz, depending on the situation. For biometrics, the phone has an ultrasonic in-display fingerprint sensor along with face recognition. On the camera side, the Galaxy S25 Edge has a dual camera setup with a 200 MP wide lens and 12 MP ultra-wide and front lenses. The periscope lens offers 10x optical zoom. This is one of Samsung's strengths, since most smartphone makers resort to digital zoom, or, essentially, cropping the image rather than offer a dedicated zoom. Samsung is focusing a lot on how thin this phone is, but there's a trade-off for that form factor: The S25 Edge has a 3,900 mAh battery, which is the smallest battery of all the Galaxy S25 phones. But there's still support for 25W wired charging and up to 15W wireless charging. What do you think so far? Just like the rest of the S25 series, you'll get access to all the latest Galaxy AI features. That includes the Now Brief, which uses AI to show you prevalent info throughout the day; Note assist, which will transcribe your notes, Live translate, and much more via Galaxy AI's integration with Google Gemini. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge will be available in Titanium Black and Titanium Silver.",
