  "description": "Jack Dorsey’s Block has created its own open-source AI agent. Called “codename goose,” the tool allows users to complete tasks using popular large language models. “You can think of Goose as an assistant that is ready to take your instructions, and do the work for you,” Block explains in a blog post. According to the company, the agent can autonomously complete engineering tasks like looking for bugs or making code changes. Users can configure goose to run on their preferred LLM. Iit supports Anthropic, Gemini, OpenAI and others, though the company says it “works best” with Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAI's o1 model. It’s also compatible with extensions, which allows it to plug into popular developer tools, like GitHub and Google Drive, Block is, of course, known for its financial apps, Square and Cash App, as well as the music streaming service Tidal, which it acquired in 2021. Those may not be industries you immediately associate with AI development, but Block founder Jack Dorsey is a longtime advocate for open-source software. The company also notes that goose could eventually extend to “non-engineering use cases” as well. Block engineer Brad Axen told ZDNET that the company envisions more “creative’ uses for goose, like music generation.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/jack-dorseys-block-has-an-ai-agent-too-212706083.html?src=rss",
