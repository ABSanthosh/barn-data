  "text": "Severance returns to Apple TV in January for its sophomore season. Severance was one of the most talked-about TV series of 2022, receiving widespread critical acclaim. We loved the series so much that Ars staffers actually wrote a group review so that everyone could weigh in with their thoughts on the first season, pronouncing it \"one of the best shows on TV.\" Needless to say, we have been eagerly awaiting the second season next month. Prime Video just released the official trailer at CCXP24 in São Paulo, Brazil and it does not disappoint. (Spoilers for first season below.) In the world of Severance, people can completely disconnect their work and personal lives. Thanks to a new procedure developed by Lumon Industries, workers can bifurcate themselves into \"innies\" (work selves) and \"outies\" (personal selves)—with no sharing of memories between them. This appeals to people like Mark (Adam Scott), who lost his wife in a car crash and has struggled to work through the grief. Why not forget all that pain for eight hours a day? It's no spoiler to say that things went... badly in S1 as a result of this process. As Ars Deputy Editor Nate Anderson noted at the time, \"The show isn't just bonkers—though it is that, too. It's also about the lengths to which we will go to dull or avoid emotional pain, and the ways in which humans will reach out to connect with others even under the most unpromising of circumstances.\" In the process, Severance brought out \"the latent horror of fluorescent lights, baby goats, cubicles, waffles, middle managers, finger traps, and 'work/life balance.' Also cults. And vending machines. Plus corporate training manuals. And talk therapy. Oh, and 'kind eyes.'\" The first season ended on quite the cliffhanger, with several Lumon employees activating an \"overtime contingency\" to escape the office confines to get a taste for how their \"outies\" live—and some pretty startling secrets were revealed. S2 will naturally grapple with the fallout from their brief mutiny. Per the official premise:",
