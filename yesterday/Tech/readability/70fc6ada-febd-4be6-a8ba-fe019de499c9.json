  "text": "Soda is a delicious addition to any meal. Sure, with all the sugar and chemicals in the kind the big box stores sell you, you’re drinking things you shouldn’t be drinking. But if you make your own “soda” with carbonated water and healthier flavorings, you can save time and money and drink healthier beverages at that. How can you do that? With a SodaStream machine, of course. And today, you can snag one from Amazon at a fantastic price. See at Amazon Head to Amazon to get the SodaStream Terra for just $60, down from its usual price of $90. That’s $30 off and a discount of 33%. This price applies to the Black, Misty Blue, and White colorways, and you get the Starter Kit as part of your purchase, which comes with the SodaStream Terra machine, a CO2 Quick Connect cylinder, a dishwasher-safe carbonating bottle, and 40mL of Bubly drops to create your first drinks. Quick and easy fizzy drinks at home for less This soda machine is super slim and fits on your countertop wherever you have space. It only really needs three things to operate: carbonation, water, and flavoring. It doesn’t run on batteries either, and needs very little flavoring to make delicious drinks. All you need to do is figure out what flavors you want and go from there. There are tons of Pepsi flavors to choose from as well as Bubly and other brands that you can mix and use to your liking to make tasty drinks that don’t come at $10 per box of 12 cans or $5 for a 2-liter, which is where we’re at in terms of groceries these days. All you need to do is fill your bottle, add your flavoring, and add the CO2 fizziness from your cartridge. It’s super easy to carbonate right in the bottle, and you’ll get the fizziest bubbles imaginable. If you’re not interested in having any flavoring, you can just have seltzer water on its own. If you want to make drinks quickly and start saving a little bit of money at home (and your health, for goodness’ sake), this is a great option. It’s inexpensive to get started with, and replacement bottles and other elements to save with are cheap too. Whether you’re getting it as a lifestyle change, to drink less sugary sodas, or to give your kids some options for when they drink at home, this is a buy you won’t soon regret. See at Amazon",
