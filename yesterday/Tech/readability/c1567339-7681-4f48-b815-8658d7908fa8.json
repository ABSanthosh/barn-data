Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication. Credit: Product image courtesy of Amazon. I used to buy cheap earbuds from random brands all the time, simply because I needed some earbuds that wouldn't give me a heart attack if (or when) I lost them or got them wet. If that sounds like your earbud-buying strategy, there's a great deal on a pair of budget earbuds that actually have pretty decent specs: the Anker Soundcore P20i. Right now, they're on sale for $19.99 (originally $39.99), the lowest price they have been according to price-checking tools. Anker has been making surprisingly good, budget-friendly earbuds, headphones, and speakers for a while. The Anker P20i/P25i (same earbuds, different names) came out in late 2023 and are a nice pair of budget earbuds offering a lot of features that you usually see in higher end earbuds. You get Bluetooth 5.3, 10-hour battery life per charge and another 30 hours from the case, a bass boost feature, and a companion app that offers more features.The app lets you choose from 22 preset EQ options so you can find the sound signature that best works for you. There is no custom EQ, but the fact that you have a companion app from a reliable brand for under $20 is impressive by itself. You can also set up a voice assistant from your phone through the app by making it one of the touch control commands.The earbuds are great for people who need a cheap pair of earbuds to take to the gym since they are rated IPX5 for water resistance, and although they don't have ANC, the in-ear design naturally eliminates a lot of background noise. These earbuds work with iOS and Android phones and have a \"Find My Device\" feature with its app.If I was still in my cheap earbuds era, I'd be grabbing these right away.
