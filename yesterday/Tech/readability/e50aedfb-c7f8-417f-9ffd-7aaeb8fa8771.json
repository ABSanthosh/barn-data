  "text": "Has all the RGB lights and excessive gaming gear on your desktop made you yearn for a simpler, more pixelated gaming experience? Govee’s latest lighting products, its Gaming Pixel Light and Mini Panel Lights, offer the best (or potentially worst) of both worlds. Its Pixel Light especially comes with a modern, spaceship-like aesthetic while containing all the faux LED pixels to remind you of the 8-bit era. Govee’s latest lighting product is tuned explicitly for gamers with its wide frame and decals. Although the Govee frame includes a 32 by 32-pixel count, it is—thanks to the modern capability of LEDs—able to depict images with a far more varied color palette than a traditional NES game ever could. It has over 150 preset “scenes,” including a clock or weather display. The frame supports static images and GIFs up to 30 FPS, which you can create and edit through an app. If you’ve ever seen Divoom’s slate of pixel art speakers and wall art, you’re likely feeling some deja vu. Divoom’s products, like the Timebox Evo and the non-speaker 64 by 64-pixel wall panel, include creating your own pixel art and animations and then setting them to music. What separates the Govee box is the sci-fi-aesthetic frame that may be more at home with some desktop setups than others. You can also use Govee’s in-app AI to generate pixel art with a prompt, though it takes so little effort to create 32-by-32-pixel art that you might as well ignore the AI capabilities entirely. Better yet, you can connect the frame to a Govee HDMI 2.1 Sync Box and the Govee app. This lets you stream your on-screen game visuals to the Gaming Pixel Light, showing off your detailed 3D game in a pseudo-2D pixel art fashion. Govee said its Gaming Pixel Light will also recognize music played through its speakers and change the visuals based on the beat and rhythm of the music. Govee said the Gaming Pixel Light will be available sometime in Q2 this year. Gizmodo is covering all the coolest and weirdest tech from the show floor at CES 2025 in Las Vegas.
