  "text": "Just when you thought Kevin Williamson couldn’t out-Kevin Williamson himself, he’s doing just that. The original Scream writer, who’s returning to helm its upcoming seventh installment, has added the most surprising returning character yet. David Arquette, one of the franchise’s original stars, is returning for Scream 7, according to Deadline. That on its own wouldn’t be a big deal… save for the fact that his character, Dewey, died in the fifth film. (Killed by recent Anora Oscar winner Mikey Madison, actually, which is beside the point.) Arquette joins a growing list of legacy Scream characters who were killed off in the franchise but are returning for this film. That includes Scott Foley, who was the killer in Scream 3, and Matthew Lillard, one of the killers in Scream 1. Arquette is the first victim to return but considering his connection to original main characters Gale (Courteney Cox) and Sidney (Neve Campbell), who are also returning, it feels a little more likely. So, what’s happening here? Are these all dream sequences? Or is Scream 7 the Wes Craven’s New Nightmare of the franchise? That film was also the seventh in its franchise and spun the entire Freddy Krueger saga on its head, telling a story set in our world and starring the actors from the movies as themselves. If Craven is paying tribute to Scream director Wes Craven by doing something similar to Scream (which would be a great way to work in Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega’s sagas) that would really be something. Then, Arquette isn’t just playing Dewey. He’s playing David Arquette who played Dewey and David Arquette is very much alive. Scream 7 is also bringing back Mason Gooding and Jasmin Savoy Brown from the previous two films, and a slew of newcomers that include Mckenna Grace, Anna Camp, Joel McHale, Mark Consuelos, and Ethan Embry. It opens February 27, 2026. Want more io9 news?
