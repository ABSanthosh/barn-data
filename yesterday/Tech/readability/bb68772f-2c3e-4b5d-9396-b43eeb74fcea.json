  "description": "UK Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle has written to the UK's national institute for AI to tell its bosses to refocus on defense and security. BBC: In a letter, Kyle said boosting the UK's AI capabilities was \"critical\" to national security and should be at the core of the Alan Turing Institute's activities. Kyle suggested the institute should overhaul its leadership team to reflect its \"renewed purpose.\" The cabinet minister said further government investment in the institute would depend on the \"delivery of the vision\" he had outlined in the letter. A spokesperson for the Alan Turing Institute said it welcomed \"the recognition of our critical role and will continue to work closely with the government to support its priorities.\" Further reading, from April: Alan Turing Institute Plans Revamp in Face of Criticism and Technological Change.
