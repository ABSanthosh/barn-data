  "text": "Wes Davis is a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.It’s been a busy week for Alien: Earth’s marketing team, having released three new teasers over the last few days. The longest of them — titled “Gestation Complete” — spends two whole minutes on the gestation and birth of an alien creature. Another, “Crate,” gives hints that Earth could be facing more than just a xenomorph, the franchise’s shiny, acid-spitting ancient aliens. Both teasers were released today, following a goofy nature documentary-themed Earth Day teaser earlier this week.“Gestation Complete” is worth sitting through if you were a fan of the look of the 1979 Alien movie that kicked off the franchise. After the creepy alien birth, you’re treated to shots of the inside of the Weyland-Yutani ship that’s carrying the alien, complete with the retro-future CRT-style displays and blinking buttons from the ship’s Mother’s chamber — the room housing the ship’s AI computer system interface. On one of the displays, an ominous message reads: “NEW SPECIES DETECTED.“The other, shorter trailer hints at what else the series might have in store, with a narrator speaking over footage of shadowy aliens behind foggy yellow containment module windows:This ship collected five different life forms from the darkest corners of the universe. Each one, a unique, deadly species. Monsters.The ship in question is headed for a crash-landing on Earth. Here’s the show’s synopsis, from the videos’ descriptions:When a mysterious space vessel crash-lands on Earth, a young woman (Sydney Chandler) and a ragtag group of tactical soldiers make a fateful discovery that puts them face-to-face with the planet’s greatest threat in FX’s highly anticipated TV series Alien: Earth from creator Noah Hawley.The rest of the cast includes Alex Lawther, Timothy Olyphant, Essie Davis, Samuel Blenkin, Babou Ceesay, David Rysdahl, Adrian Edmondson, Adarsh Gourav, Jonathan Ajayi, Erana James, Lily Newmark, Diem Camille, and Moe Bar-El. Alien: Earth is set to release this summer on FX and Hulu.",
