The Ultra plan is now available in 73 countries, and we’re working hard to bring it to even more.Google AI Pro subscribers in those countries get limited access to Veo 3 in Flow, and a 10-pack of trial video generations to test it out in the Gemini app. Starting today, Pro subscribers will also have access to Veo 3 in the Gemini mobile app. It's important that people can access provenance tools for content online. The SynthID watermark is embedded in all content generated by Google's generative AI models. Our SynthID Detector rolled out to early testers last week, and we plan to expand access soon. As an additional step to help people identify AI-generated content, today we're adding a visible watermark to all videos, except for videos generated by Ultra members in Flow, our tool for AI filmmakers.",
