Credit: Leah Stodart / Mashable SAVE $800: As of March 25, the Roborock Qrevo Master robot vacuum is on sale for $799.99 at Amazon's Big Spring Sale. That's a full 50% off of its original $1,599.99, and its lowest price ever at Amazon. Amazon never disappoints with robot vacuum deals at its big sales, and the Big Spring Sale is timed perfectly between the Black Friday and Prime Day seasons. A ton of options hit 30% off or more, but as someone who tests robot vacuums for a living, narrowing down my top one or two recommendations for someone is easy. I simply scan the list for my ultimate favorite robot vacuums that I've tested at home. Lo and behold, the Roborock Qrevo Master (my favorite from all of 2024) is 50% off for the spring sale. Originally retailing at a steep $1,599.99, the Qrevo Master is down to $799.99 — a whole $100 less than its Cyber Monday price a few months ago. Is it still on the premium end of the price scale? Yes. Does it do more than pretty much any other robot vacuum going for $800? Hell yes.Though the Qrevo Master has been dethroned as the most powerful Roborock I've tested by the new Saros 10R from CES, it's still one of the most solid cleaners you'll find. Its 10,000 Pa of suction is speaking to pet owners keeping up with kibble, kitty litter, or shedding from more than one pet on multiple floor types. I was most psyched about its mopping capabilities, however. The dual spinning mopping design has become my own personal gold standard over a singular flat pad. This is corner detailing that most Roombas just can't achieve. Credit: Leah Stodart / Mashable One of those spinning pads operates on a hinge that can flex the pad out from under the circular vac to mop along edges or in corners. The visual satisfaction is one thing, but the relief of the mystery sticky stuff along my kitchen counter baseboards being taken care of is priceless. Mashable Deals Other premium features packed into the Qrevo Master include self-washing and drying mopping pads, small obstacle avoidance, and a livestream pet camera on the botvac itself. Leah Stodart is a Philadelphia-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable where she covers essential home tech like vacuums and TVs as well as sustainable swaps and travel. Her ever-growing experience in these categories comes in clutch when making recommendations on how to spend your money during shopping holidays like Black Friday, which Leah has been covering for Mashable since 2017.The robot vacuum beat in particular has cemented itself as Leah's main ~thing~ across the past few years. Since 2019, her expertise has been perpetually bolstered by the meticulous eye she keeps on robot vacuum deals and new releases, but more importantly, her hands-on experience with more than 25 robot vacuums tested in her own home. (This number has probably gone up by the time you're reading this.) That at-home testing is standardized through Mashable's robot testing guide — a granular scoring rubric for assessing all aspects of owning and using a robot vacuum on the daily — that Leah created herself.Leah graduated from Penn State University in 2016 with dual degrees in Sociology and Media Studies. When she's not writing about shopping (or shopping online for herself), she's almost definitely watching a horror movie, \"RuPaul's Drag Race,\" or \"The Office.\" You can follow her on X at @notleah or email her at [email protected].

Her ever-growing experience in these categories comes in clutch when making recommendations on how to spend your money during shopping holidays like Black Friday, which Leah has been covering for Mashable since 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe robot vacuum beat in particular has cemented itself as Leah\u0026#39;s main ~thing~ across the past few years. Since 2019, her expertise has been perpetually bolstered by the meticulous eye she keeps on robot vacuum deals and new releases, but more importantly, her hands-on experience with more than 25 robot vacuums tested in her own home. (This number has probably gone up by the time you\u0026#39;re reading this.) That at-home testing is standardized through Mashable\u0026#39;s robot testing guide — a granular scoring rubric for assessing all aspects of owning and using a robot vacuum on the daily — that Leah created herself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLeah graduated from Penn State University in 2016 with dual degrees in Sociology and Media Studies.
