You can pay for TSA PreCheck to keep your shoes on when walking through airport security, but what about the rest of us who don't particularly enjoy the indignity of shuffling our socks or -- eek! -- bare soles across a floor that's had thousands of other shoes and feet scrape across it. Read more: These Are the Official 2025 Best of CES Winners, Awarded by CNET GroupIn order to speed up the process and decrease the ick factor, the Transportation Security Administration is at CES 2025 in Las Vegas showing off new tech that would let you keep your shoes on while scanning footwear for prohibited items.  Watch this: I Made Things Weird Trying TSA's New Shoe Scanner Machine 03:53The premise is simple: You step onto the platform, placing each foot in a marked area. Millimeter-wave technology scans your shoe and sends data to a computer. When CNET's Bridget Carey spotted the technology being demonstrated, she knew she had to shake things up and see how the TSA's new tech would respond.\"Let's make it interesting,\" Carey said. \"Maybe I should put something in my shoe and see what happens on the scanner machine.\"Carey tucked a variety of small objects, including a dental floss pick, gummy worm, mustard packet and plastic knife, inside her shoe before stepping up on the TSA's scanning platform. CES 2025: Amazing Futuristic Tech Concepts to Look Forward To See all photos Shoes have been an issue at the airport for over two decades. In December 2001, Richard Reid tried to blow up an American Airlines flight with homemade bombs he'd hidden in his shoes. He was subdued after struggling to light the fuse, and no one was injured, but in 2006, the TSA began requiring passengers to remove their shoes while going through security.Brian Lewis of the Department of Homeland Security told Carey that if the new shoe tech is deployed at airports, the checkpoint officers themselves won't actually review the images.Read more: Nike's Prototype Shoes Squeezed and Heated Our Weary Feet at CES 2025. Here's What They Feel Like\"Everything would be run by automated detection algorithm,\" Lewis said. \"So the officer would get a red light or a green light, essentially saying, are the shoes good to go, or do we need to do further inspection?\"The machines are looking for a variety of things, Lewis said, including shoes that have been tampered with, specific material properties and other issues. CES 2025: Best Product Overall, Plus 28 More Must-See Gadgets (and Counting) See all photos The technology relays the image in slices, essentially building up the photo of the shoes on the computer screen, layer by layer. One demo shoe had a metal letter \"F\" hidden inside, and Lewis showed Carey how the metal letter slowly materialized as the image slices piled up. A scan takes only about a second, and the image is displayed almost immediately.Gummy worm detection needs some workCarey's object-filled shoes showed up weirdly on the scan, as would be expected. Lewis was able to point out the condiment packet and the outline of the plastic knife.\"I'm not sure I see the gummy worm, so we may need to do some additional development to be able to detect those effectively,\" he said. CES 2025 Proves It's Still Deeply Weird With These Bonkers Gadgets See all photos When the machine rescanned her shoes without the objects, she was good to go.\"As we're moving towards trying to get to a more seamless travel experience, we know that something the traveling public would like [is to] no longer have to take their shoes off,\" Lewis said. \"So bringing this technology to passengers is something that we think they'll be really excited about.\"The scanner is still a prototype, and data from the CES demonstration will be collected and used for further development.For more from CES, check out the best TVs we saw and the most innovative things you can actually order now.",
