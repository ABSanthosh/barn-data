However, the biggest game of the year, if not this decade, Grand Theft Auto VI, is still coming this fall, according to publisher Take-Two. Take-Two released its earnings Thursday and affirmed during its presentation that the next entry in the popular franchise is coming this fall. Company CEO Strauss Zelnick confirmed that the company \"feels really good\" that GTA 6's release will happen later in the year. \"Look, there's always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like absolutely, you jinx things,\" Zelnick told IGN Thursday. \"So we feel really good about it.\"Rumors of GTA 6's existence circulated in the years following the release of 2013's GTA 5. It wasn't until 2022 when developer Rockstar Game gave a definitive confirmation that the game was in development after a series of leaks showing some details about the game. Then in late 2023, the first trailer of the game dropped. Yet rumors have also swirled about the game's eventual release date, especially early this year as Bloomberg's Jason Schreier predicted that GTA 6's launch could be pushed to 2026. Thursday's announcement is a reassurance to players with some wiggle room in case the game's release date is pushed back further. Unlike previous games, GTA 6 has players step into the roles of a criminal duo, with only the female character's name being confirmed, Lucia. The game takes place across a parody of Florida called Leonida, which includes Vice City. GTA 6 is set to be released on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles.  Watch this: Everything We Expect in Gaming in 2025 05:01",
