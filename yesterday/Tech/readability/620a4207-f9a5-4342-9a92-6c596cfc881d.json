The agency argues that there‚Äôs a pressing need for progress. The proportion of the global population aged over 65 is set to triple by 2100. At the same time, labour shortages for physically demanding jobs are increasing. Robots could provide essential support. The robotics teams Members of the programme have proposed diverse solutions to the challenge. Arthur Robotics, a startup based in London, wants to commercialise an mechnical hand inspired by biology. Focused on manufacturing, the motorised limb blends soft, deformable contact surfaces with rich tactile sensing and reinforcement learning. A team led by Lorenzo Jamone, an associate professor in robotics and AI at University College London, will develop electronic skin. Based on magnetic technology, the skin aims to measure 3D contact forces at multiple points. It can also bend and stretch. Startups from outside the UK are also contributing. Denmark‚Äôs Pliantics will create soft linear actuators, which will serve as ‚Äúartificial muscles‚Äù that enhance a robot‚Äôs physical interactions. Another set of artificial muscles will be built by Artimus, a US company, alongside researchers from the University of Bristol. Nicholas Kellaris, the co-founder and Chief Research Officer of Artimus, praised the project‚Äôs emphasis on cooperation. ‚ÄúThis programme is unique in how it encourages and actively facilitates collaboration amongst creators at all levels of development, from fundamental hardware to the simulation, integration, and validation of full solutions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre thrilled to have the opportunity to [join] this multi-level and cross-disciplinary approach.‚Äù The ARIA model Established in 2023, ARIA funds ‚Äúhigh-risk, high-reward‚Äù research. The strategy has drawn comparisons to DARPA, a US Department of Defence agency that develops emerging technologies. The Pentagon unit has been involved in a variety of transformative innovations, from the internet and GPS to stealth technology and autonomous vehicles. At ARIA, a diverse array of projects is already underway. One unveiled last year plans to provide ‚Äúquantitative safety guarantees‚Äù for AI with digital gatekeepers. Another aims to create early warning systems for climate tipping points. A third looks to nature to train AI at 0.1% of the cost. With the arrival of the robotics dexterity teams, ARIA is now adding futuristic hardware to its labs. You can find the full list of the concepts in the programme here.",
