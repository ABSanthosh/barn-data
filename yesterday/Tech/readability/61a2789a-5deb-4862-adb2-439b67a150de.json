  "text": "Viewing this reel of Scanline VFX‘s work on Andor season 2’s most iconic sets makes us want to watch the show all over again. The digital effects breakdown from the post-production house showcases that VFX and practical effects orchestrated in balance are what made Tony Gilroy’s take on the Star Wars universe so cinematic. The reel displays the exceptional work that went into making places like Coruscant, Mina Rau, and Yavin look so richly alive. Through the use of real locations, environments, and scenery, the next-level post-production magic seamlessly disappears into every single frame. There’s no obvious LED volume used like on the other Star Wars shows, including The Mandalorian universe, and it shows. Seeing how it’s all layered together is that good sort of dopamine process content that is such a joy to watch. Notice how real fields of grain were used with the silos composited in; you can hardly tell. The VFX industry is one that, while mired with rush jobs and artists not being given their due with proper time, really shines when the value is placed on the artists behind the screen. When we get wins like this in such a huge franchise, it shows that’s how it should be. The Coruscant hospital was a major part of the breakdown, and how they scaled it up to be a high-rise from a backlot set is absolutely astounding. Time and time again, supporting the entertainment industry’s VFX creatives produces the best art over digital environments, bar none. Want more io9 news? Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what’s next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who.",
