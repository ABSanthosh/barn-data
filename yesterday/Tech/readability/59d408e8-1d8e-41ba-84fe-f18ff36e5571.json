  "text": "To start, if you haven‚Äôt heard about the #wpdrama that‚Äôs taken over WordPress in the last month, congratulations üòä. I imagine you‚Äôve had a comparatively stress-free October, and hopefully got to spend lots of time outdoors. There are many, many, many posts, videos, and commentaries about everything that‚Äôs happened. I won‚Äôt go into the full details, but here‚Äôs a condensed version for those of you who are new here. Skip to the next section if you know all of this already. #The players #WordPress WordPress is an open-source software platform for building websites. It‚Äôs what this site is built with üß°. WP Fusion is a plugin (another piece of software) that runs on your WordPress website, and helps you connect your website with your email marketing software. By some estimates WordPress powers 43% of websites, so it‚Äôs kind of a big deal. WordPress was created in 2003, based on another older piece of blogging software, by two guys named Mike and Matt. Matt continues to oversee development of WordPress. He chooses who is allowed to work on it, and what features are prioritized for development. #The WordPress Foundation The WordPress Foundation is a non-profit organization that was founded in 2010. Its main goal is to protect open-source software and ensure that WordPress remains freely available and developed by a global community. The foundation holds the trademarks to the WordPress logo and the name ‚ÄúWordPress‚Äù, as well as ‚ÄúWordCamp‚Äú. The stated goal of the Foundation is to maintain the open-source nature of WordPress, independent from commercial interests. The Foundation is also run by Matt. #WordPress.org WordPress.org is the home of the free and open-source WordPress project. It‚Äôs where anyone can go to download WordPress for free. It‚Äôs also where development on WordPress is organized, and conversations around WordPress happen in the official Slack channel, tied to each user‚Äôs account on WordPress.org. WordPress.org is also the home of the plugin repository, which is a directory of over 60,000 free plugins that anyone can download and install on their WordPress website. WordPress.org plays a critical role in ensuring plugins are secure and follow the open-source principles of the WordPress project (free to use, modify, and distribute). When a plugin author releases an update to a plugin on WordPress.org (like we regularly do with the free WP Fusion Lite), WordPress.org sends the update out to everybody else‚Äôs WordPress sites. It‚Äôs like the App Store of WordPress. WordPress.org is personally owned by Matt. #WordPress.com WordPress.com is a commercial website-building platform. It uses the free WordPress software, but it‚Äôs a hosted service. That means you don‚Äôt need to worry about setting up your own hosting or downloading the software‚Äîeverything is managed for you. WordPress.com is run by a for-profit company called Automattic. Automattic is widely considered the largest hosting company in the WordPress space. It also owns popular brands such as WooCommerce, Jetpack, Tumblr, and (I was surprised to learn) Longreads. Automattic is a privately held company, and is backed by private equity firms such as¬†Tiger Global Management,¬†Salesforce Ventures,¬†Insight Venture Partners, and others. They generate about US$700 million per year in revenue, and have been valued at US $7.5 billion. The founder and CEO of Automattic is, you guessed it, Matt. #Conflict of interest Some have raised concerns about the legality of this business arrangement. I won‚Äôt get into those here. I think it‚Äôs enough to point out the inherent conflict of interest in having the same person: a.) act as the public face of the WordPress community, b.) protect the WordPress trademarks, and b.) guide the development of the open-source WordPress project, all while c.) his majority stake in the for-profit Automattic has given him a net worth close to US$400 million. Matt has styled himself as the Benevolent Dictator for Life, and we‚Äôre expected to trust that his priorities are aligned with promoting open source, fostering community well-being, and ensuring a level playing field for independent companies to thrive‚Äîwithout the risk of preferential treatment for Automattic or any other affiliated entities. The drama over the past month (some might say over the past six years), basically comes down to this conflict of interest, and to what degree you trust Matt to do the right thing. #How this affects WP Fusion On October 12th, Matt shocked many people in the WordPress community by forcibly taking over a popular plugin on the wordpress.org repository called Advanced Custom Fields, which was in use on over 2 million websites. ‚ÄúACF‚Äù is developed by WP Engine, a competitor of Automattic. The plugin was re-titled ‚ÄúSecure Custom Fields‚Äú, but otherwise unchanged. The plugin code, URL, file names, thousands of reviews, and even links to documentation still referenced Advanced Custom Fields, which is trademarked by WP Engine. WP Fusion also has a free plugin on wordpress.org, called WP Fusion Lite. We also have a registered trademark for the name WP FUSION. We are committed to making this plugin free, forever, to anyone who wants to integrate their WordPress website with their CRM. Seeing ACF forcibly taken from its rightful owners, in violation of community standards (and possibly trademark law), left us scrambling to make sure our intellectual property was properly protected. A search for ‚ÄúAdvanced Custom Fields‚Äù now brings up ‚ÄúSecure Custom Fields‚Äù as the second result, still using the trademarked URL slug. #Wait, aren‚Äôt WordPress plugins open source and free to modify? Yes! The beautiful thing about WordPress, open source, and the GPL license is that everything we create is free to read, modify, and redistribute as you see fit. We borrow lots of code and ideas from other plugins, many other plugins borrow code and ideas from us. This fosters a vibrant and competitive marketplace, allowing anyone with a good idea to launch a new product without having to worry about being similar to something that is copyrighted by an established player. However, while our code is free to copy, our trademark protects our business in trade. It‚Äôs how, when you purchase from us, you know you are getting the real WP Fusion from the original company who created, maintains, and supports it. Somebody could take our code, rename it ‚ÄúAwesome CRM Connector‚Äù, create their own website and documentation, and this would be perfectly legal ‚úÖ However, if someone built a website at https://betterwpfusion.com/ and sold our plugin using our name and logo, this would be a trademark violation, as it has the potential to deceive customers as to who they are purchasing from. Our code is free, but the trademark protects the many years we‚Äôve spent establishing a brand identity and a reputation as creators of Very Good Plugins (our company name ü§ì). As Matt has stated repeatedly, you have to protect your trademarks. #Trademark confusion at WordPress.com In September 2023 it came to our attention that WordPress.com (the for-profit hosting service) had copied all of the free plugins from WordPress.org and was now displaying them in a private directory, exclusive to WordPress.com hosting customers. These pages were made public, indexed by search engines, and in some cases ranked higher than the free versions on WordPress.org. WP Fusion Lite was copied onto wordpress.com without permission, and used to sell premium hosting plans. Further, it was no longer clear that the plugins were free. The text next to each plugin reads, ‚ÄúFree on Business plan‚Äú, and clicking the link prompts you to create an account at WordPress.com and sign up for premium hosting. This created confusion among users who would contact our support (for paying customers), and expect priority responses or premium features because they had ‚Äúpaid‚Äù for the plugin, when they hadn‚Äôt paid us anything‚Äî they‚Äôd only paid WordPress.com for hosting. While we knew about this for some time, I didn‚Äôt quite know what to do about it. I didn‚Äôt want to start a legal dispute with Automattic and possibly damage our reputation. And, generally, I trusted Matt. I assumed he had a competent legal team that had already reviewed the legality of copying our plugins, and that he was acting in the best interest of the community. #The cease and desist The events of the past month have made me realize a few things: I don‚Äôt trust Matt. Matt doesn‚Äôt appear to be taking advice from legal counsel. Always defend your trademarks. With those points in mind we sent a cease and desist letter to Automattic and WordPress.com on October 12th, asking for WP Fusion Lite to be removed from WordPress.com due to the potential for confusion regarding the affiliation of the WP Fusion brand. Our letter to Automattic This was a difficult decision to make, as Matt has been known to use the resources of WordPress.org to personally retaliate against perceived threats to Automattic. There was a very real chance we would be removed from the free .org repository as well, blocked from the Make WordPress Slack, and/or banned from sponsoring future WordCamps (we sponsored WCAsia in 2024 and look forward to sponsoring WCEU in 2025). Thankfully WP Fusion Pro does not require the free version to function, and we have been delivering updates to our paying customers via our own servers for many years. We had a plan in place to begin delivering Lite updates via our own servers if the worst came to pass. #Automattic‚Äôs reply Automattic‚Äôs General Counsel responded on October 18th. Automattic‚Äôs reply They have agreed to take down the listing from wordpress.com, and it is no longer available at https://wordpress.com/plugins/wp-fusion-lite. The top result in searches for ‚ÄúWP Fusion Lite‚Äù is again the WordPress.org listing, where anyone can download the plugin for free. It‚Äôs been a stressful week, but I‚Äôm glad we were able to resolve the situation amicably, and clear up any potential confusion for our users. #What‚Äôs next? It seems like every week there is another unexpected move from Matt that throws the WordPress community into chaos. I wish it were all over, but it doesn‚Äôt show any sign of ending soon. I would like to imagine a future where Matt is either the CEO of Automattic, or the champion of the open source project. I have nothing against him personally‚Äî I hear that he‚Äôs a great person to work for, and I‚Äôm appreciative of all the things he‚Äôs done for the open source movement. But as long as Matt‚Äôs motivations with WordPress are tied to his profits at Automattic, he can‚Äôt be trusted.",
