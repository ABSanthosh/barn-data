  "text": "The next big iOS update probably isn't too far off, but don't expect a ton from it.Apple's next software update will be iOS 18.3, or at least, that's what everyone expects right now. Since iOS 18.2 just came out, that would make sense. It should be noted that we don't know specifically when iOS 18.3 will launch or entirely what it will entail when it does come out. However, per 9to5Mac, the x.3 update for each of the last three versions of iOS came out in late January, so expect iOS 18.3 to launch in late January, unless something weird happens. Mashable Light Speed As for big new features coming to iOS 18.3, we really only know about one right now, and \"big\" might be a generous word to use for it: robot vacuum control. Specifically, you'll be able to use the Home app to control robot vacuums, in the same way you can currently use the app to control smart home lights and other devices. The weird part is that Apple doesn't currently produce a robot vacuum of its own, but that could happen in the future. Everything else that's currently in the developer beta for iOS 18.3 fits under the umbrella of \"bug fixes and minor improvements,\" unfortunately. That doesn't mean there won't be bigger features eventually to be unveiled, but things like Apple Intelligence will probably need to wait until iOS 18.4, at the earliest.",
