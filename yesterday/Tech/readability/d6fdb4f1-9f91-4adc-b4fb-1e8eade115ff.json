If you’ve been eyeing a MacBook but are hesitant to splurge on a brand-new model, StackSocial has an incredible early Black Friday deal that you won’t want to miss: For just $249, you can grab a refurbished 2017 MacBook Air with 128 GB of storage, a price that’s a staggering reduction from its original retail price of $999. While it’s true that you won’t find this model at its original price anymore, the value it offers at this discount is undeniable. See at StackSocial This Grade A refurbished MacBook Air is in near-mint condition and showcases minimal signs of wear and tear: It’s as close to new as you can get without paying the premium price tag. For anyone who wants the Apple experience without paying the full price, this laptop is an excellent choice. The 2017 model features a reliable Intel Core i5 processor running at 1.8 GHz and it can handle everyday tasks with ease. Whether you’re browsing the web, streaming videos or working on documents, this machine delivers smooth performance. Affordable Yet Powerful Laptop This MacBook Air on sale at StackSocial comes equipped with 128 GB of solid-state storage which provides ample space for your files and applications. If you find yourself needing more storage down the line, you can easily expand it by connecting an external drive via one of its USB-A ports. The Intel HD Graphics 6000 card enhances your visual experience and makes it perfect for light gaming and media consumption on its 13.3-inch screen. What’s great is that this MacBook Air can last up to 12 hours on a single charge and allows you to work or play throughout the day without constantly searching for an outlet. This makes it an ideal companion for students or professionals who are always on the go. Portability is another strong suit of the MacBook Air : It weights just 2.96 pounds and has a slim profile (only 0.11 inches thick when closed) si it’s easy to slip into a backpack or briefcase. While there are many budget laptops available in the market today, most fall short in terms of quality and reliability compared to the MacBook Air.

Choosing this Grade-A MacBook Air from StackSocial means investing in a product known for its longevity and performance at a price point that rivals lower-end PCs. Moreover, purchasing refurbished electronics is not only budget-friendly but also environmentally conscious. By opting for a refurbished device, you contribute to reducing electronic waste while still enjoying high-quality technology. This particular MacBook Air comes with a 90-day warranty covering parts and labor which gives you peace of mind with your purchase. See at StackSocial",
