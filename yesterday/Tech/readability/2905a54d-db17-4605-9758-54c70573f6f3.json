  "text": "The IRS is finally moving forward with a new tax reporting rule that will require services like PayPal, Venmo or Cash App to issue tax form 1099-K to freelancers and side hustlers who earned more than $5,000 via third-party payment apps. That means the IRS will know if you earned money from a freelance or contract job and don't report it on your tax return.If you earn freelance or self-employment income, you should already be paying taxes on your total earnings, even if you don't receive a 1099 form. This isn't a new tax requirement; it's a tax reporting change. The IRS will be switching the reporting requirement to payment apps so it can keep tabs on transactions that often go unreported. This new rule will only require third-party apps to report income earned -- the IRS isn't interested in the money you sent to your family or friends to pay rent or split a dinner bill.This new tax reporting rule was first announced in 2021 to capture income over $600 that was paid through third-party payment apps. It was supposed to go live in 2022, but was delayed two years in a row. In 2023, the IRS announced that 2024 would be a transitional tax year, to give payment apps more time to prepare for the change. Instead of the $600 minimum, only individuals who made more than $5,000 in income through third-party apps would receive a 1099-K.\"Prior to 2024, the earnings threshold was $20,000 and 200 transactions to receive a 1099-K tax document,\" said Mark Steber, chief tax information officer for Jackson Hewitt. If you earned $5,000 or more through third-party payment apps this year, you should receive a 1099-K to report your income when you file your tax return in 2025. Here's everything you need to know about this reporting change.Read more: Updated IRS Federal Tax Brackets Could Boost Your Paycheck Next Year. Here's Why What is a 1099-K?A 1099-K is a tax form that reports income received via a third-party payment platform from a non-permanent job, such as a side hustle, freelance agreement or contractor position where taxes are not withheld. The IRS currently requires any third-party payment apps like Cash App and Venmo to send a 1099-K to the IRS and individuals if they earned more than $20,000 in commercial payments across more than 200 transactions. If you regularly make over $20,000 in freelance income, are paid through Venmo, and receive more than 200 transactions in payments, you may have received a 1099-K tax form before.What is the new IRS 1099-K reporting rule?Under new reporting requirements first announced in the American Rescue Plan, third-party payment apps will eventually be required to report earnings over $600 to the IRS. For your 2024 taxes (which you'll file in 2025), the IRS is planning a phased rollout, requiring payment apps to report freelancer and business owner earnings over $5,000 instead of $600. The hope is that raising the threshold will reduce the risk of inaccuracies while also giving the agency and payment apps more time to work toward the eventual $600 minimum.\"The taxation and tax treatment requirements for taxpayers has not changed,\" said Steber. \"This taxable income has always been considered by the IRS to be taxable and should be reported on a tax return. The new change requires the online platforms to provide 1099-Ks to both their users and the IRS at a lower threshold than in prior years.\"Why was the 1099-K rule delayed?Originally set to kick off at the beginning of 2022, the IRS planned to implement a new reporting rule that would require third-party payment apps, like PayPal, Venmo or Cash App to report income of over $600 or more per year to the tax agency. The IRS has delayed this new reporting requirement in 2022 and again in 2023.Why? Distinguishing between taxable and nontaxable transactions through third-party apps isn't always easy. For example, money your roommate sends you through Venmo for dinner is not taxable, but money received for a graphic design project might be. The delayed rollout gave payment platforms more time to prepare.\"We spent many months gathering feedback from third-party groups and others, and it became increasingly clear we need additional time to effectively implement the new reporting requirements,\" said IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel in a November 2023 statement.Which payment apps are included in this IRS rule?All third-party payment apps where freelancers and business owners receive income are required to begin reporting transactions involving you to the IRS in 2024. Some popular payment apps include PayPal, Venmo and Cash App. Other platforms freelancers may use, such as Fivver or Upwork, are also on the hook to begin reporting payments that freelancers receive throughout the year. If you earn income through payment apps, it's a good idea to set up separate PayPal, Cash App or Venmo accounts for your professional transactions. This could prevent nontaxable charges -- money sent from family or friends -- from being included on your 1099-K in error.Zelle users will not receive a 1099-KThere's one popular payment app that's exempt from the 1099-K rule. Payment transfer service Zelle will not be issuing 1099-Ks, regardless of whether you receive business funds through the service or not. That's because Zelle doesn't hold your funds in an account, like PayPal, Venmo or Cash App do, and instead is used as a way to transfer money between bank accounts. If you are paid for your freelance or small business services through Zelle, it's your responsibility to report all income on Schedule C of your tax return.Is the IRS taxing money sent to family or friends?No. Rumors have circulated that the IRS was cracking down on money sent to family and friends through third-party payment apps, but that isn't true. Personal transactions involving gifts, favors or reimbursements are not considered taxable. Some examples of nontaxable transactions include: Money received from a family member as a holiday or birthday giftMoney received from a friend covering their portion of a restaurant billMoney received from your roommate or partner for their share of the rent and utilitiesPayments that will be reported on a 1099-K must be flagged as payments for goods or services from the vendor. When you select \"sending money to family or friends,\" it won't appear on your tax form. In other words, that money from your roommate for her half of the restaurant bill is safe.\"This is only for self-employment income,\" said Steber. \"You should not receive a 1099-K for personal transactions but be aware that some platforms could accidently include personal transactions in the 1099-K and that will need to be corrected on the users tax return.\"Read more: Election 2024: Where Each Presidential Candidate Stands on the Child Tax CreditWill you owe taxes on items sold on Facebook marketplace?If you sell personal items for less than you paid for them and collect the money via third-party payment apps, these changes won't affect you. For example, if you buy a couch for your home for $500 and later sell it on Facebook Marketplace for $200, you won't owe taxes on the sale because it's a personal item you've sold at a loss. You may be required to show documentation of the original purchase to prove that you sold the item at a loss.If you have a side hustle where you buy items and resell them for a profit via PayPal or another digital payment app, then earnings over $5,000 will be considered taxable and reported to the IRS in 2024. Make sure to keep a good record of your purchases and online transactions to avoid paying taxes on any nontaxable income -- and when in doubt, contact a tax professional for help.How to prepare for this reporting changeAny payment apps you use may ask you to confirm your tax information, such as your employer identification number, individual tax identification number or Social Security number. If you own a business, you most likely have an EIN, but if you're a sole proprietor, individual freelancer or gig worker, you'll provide an ITIN or SSN. In some cases, receiving a 1099-K may take some of the manual work out of filing your self-employment taxes.Once this rule takes effect, you may still receive individual 1099-NEC forms if you were paid through direct deposit, check or cash. If you have multiple clients who pay you through PayPal, Venmo, Upwork or other third-party payment apps and you earn more than $5,000, you'll receive one 1099-K instead of multiple 1099-NECs. To avoid any reporting confusion, make sure you're tracking your earnings manually or with accounting software such as Quickbooks. More money adviceSide Hustlers and Freelancers, I Swear by These 7 Tax TipsI Turned My Passion Into a Side Hustle.
