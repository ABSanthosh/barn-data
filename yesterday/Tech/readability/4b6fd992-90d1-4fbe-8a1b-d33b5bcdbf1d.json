  "text": "Many schools are now bracing for steep declines in support. At Duke University, administrators have implemented hiring freezes, scaled back research plans, and will cut the number of admitted biomedical PhD students by 23 percent or more, according to reporting by the Associated Press. The school took in $580 million in grants and contracts from the National Institutes of Health last year. At Vanderbilt University, faculty were sent an email on February 6 instructing them to reduce graduate admissions by half across the board, according to Stat. The outlet also reported that faculty at the University of Washington's School of Public Health have reduced admissions. Faculty at the University of Pennsylvania also reported having to rescind admission offers to applicants and were directed to significantly reduce admission rates, according to The Daily Pennsylvanian. The University of Wisconsin-Madison, too, is shrinking its graduate programs, according to the WKOW.com. Beth Sullivan, who oversees graduate programs at Duke, told the AP that the shrinking classes mean a shrinking pipeline into America's medical research community, which dominates the world's health research fields and is a significant force in the country's economy. \"Our next generation of researchers are now poised on the edge of this cliff, not knowing if there's going to be a bridge that's going to get them to the other side, or if this is it,\" Sullivan said. \"This is a severe blow to science and the training of the next generation of scientists,” Siyuan Wang, a geneticist and cell biologist at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, told Nature. \"With fewer scientists, there will be less science and innovation that drive societal progress and the improvement of public health.\" This post was updated to correct Rachael Sirianni's job title.",
