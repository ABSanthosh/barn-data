  "text": "If you're working hard, that thing is covered in sweat. (Gross.) We may earn a commission from links on this page. Credit: BrandonKleinPhoto / Shutterstock.com I teach a handful of cycling classes every week, and after each one, I grab a spray bottle of cleaner and a paper towel from the back of the studio and give my stationary bike a wipe-down. It only makes sense: The whole point of being on it is to get all sweaty and gross, and it's inevitable some of that sweat will wind up on the bike. I have no idea what's in the bottle of cleaner, as I trust the gym's cleaning team to provide me with the right tools to keep the equipment in good shape. But when it comes to my Peloton at home, I am the cleaning team, which means I have to be much more on top of things. Here's what I've learned about how to clean every part of the machine after four years of ownership. Clean your Peloton after every rideFirst, keep a microfiber cloth or roll of Clorox wipes nearby so as soon as you dismount, you can wipe down your seat and handlebars. There isn't a ton of space on the bike itself to hang a cloth, and it's my duty as a spin teacher to gently suggest you not hang it off your handlebar when you ride, lest you go to grab the bar, accidentally yank the towel off, and lose your grip. (I don't let people in my classes cover their handlebars with sweat towels for this reason.) I keep a jumbo roll of pre-moistened Clorox wipes on hand and use those on the metal components, seat, and handlebars as soon as I finish a session. It works great.If you own a Peloton, you're probably already tired of spending extra money to buy accessories for it, but consider picking up a simple peel-and-stick hook for a nearby wall or even a shoe hanger designed to dangle off the bike itself and stashing your microfiber cloth there for easy post-ride access. Whether it makes more sense for you to use a rag or wipes, as long as you're wiping it down after each session, you're doing enough to keep it from getting too grimy between more serious cleanings.Do an occasional deeper cleanAbout once a month, I dampen a rag and use a dot of dish soap, then wipe down the whole bike, minus any of the electrical components, including the outlet cord powering the bike and the wires connected to the screen (which I just wipe down with a dry microfiber cloth). Scrub the base, wheels, various adjuster handles, and everything else, then go back over it with a dry cloth. Peloton's website suggests using baby wipes for this, but a damp towel works just as well. Notably, I tried to move my seat the other night and found that my adjuster handle was stuck. There could be two causes: It's been way too long since I cleaned it and that thing got sticky and nasty or I used too wet of a rag last time and it got gummy with dried soap. Either way, that's not good for the bike I spent so much on, nor is it good for me to have to deal with. Today, I cleaned it with a damp—but not soaked—soapy cloth, making sure to get in every nook and cranny. Then, I went over it with a dry cloth to make sure no soap remained behind. Wipe in all the nooks and crannies, like the adjustor handles. Credit: Lindsey Ellefson Take care with the screenTo clean the screen, Peloton recommends first holding down the red button on top until it powers down, then using an ammonia-free cleaner designed for use on LCD, plasma, or other flatscreen, and wiping with a microfiber cloth. Windex is a suitable option, and that's what I use once a month, or when the screen is visibly covered in dust, dry sweat, or whatever else. When powered off, the screen is incredibly reflective and difficult to photograph, so forgive me, but in the photo below you can see the improvement made with just one pass of Windex. A little before-and-after action with the Windex Credit: Lindsey Ellefson Other Peloton cleaning recommendationsIf you're feeling uneasy about using your existing cleaning products on the bike, consider investing in some designed for use on workout equipment. Wipex comes recommended by users on Reddit and is an affordable option that can ease your worries about what you're slopping all over your $1,500 device.During your monthly-or-so deeper clean, don't forget about the mat you have probably placed under the machine—wipe that down with a damp rag and a dab of dish soap or the Wipex cloths too.Finally, you should also be cleaning and deodorizing your shoes. Because the Peloton has no straps that enable you to wear regular athletic shoes, like most bikes at studios do, you have to ride using specialty cycling shoes. That's an annoying added expense, but it can also cause some stink, since those shoes are only used for sweaty activities and never get to leave the house and feel a nice breeze. Wipe down the exterior with your Wipex, Clorox, or soapy cloth, but to deodorize the interior, sprinkle some baking soda and leave them overnight before vacuuming and wiping it out. Full disclosure: I don't do that because I leave mine clipped to the pedals at all times and irrationally hate clipping and unclipping them. As a result, they're always hanging upside-down when not in use, so baking soda will fall right out. I spray the interior of mine with a mix of half vinegar, half water, then let them air dry for a day. It works great. Spritz the inside of your cycling shoes to keep them odor-free, please.
