  "text": "(Stratechery) Welcome back to This Week in Stratechery! As a reminder, each week, every Friday, we’re sending out this overview of content in the Stratechery bundle; highlighted links are free for everyone. Additionally, you have complete control over what we send to you. If you don’t want to receive This Week in Stratechery emails (there is no podcast), please uncheck the box in your delivery settings. On that note, here were a few of our favorites this week. The Economic Future of the Web. One reason why I love writing is that it, more than any other medium, forces me to challenge and validate my initial reactions to a piece of news, and this week provided a perfect example. My initial reaction to Cloudflare’s Content Independence Day, when they blocked AI crawlers by default, was discomfort at the advantage this provided Google, along with the audacious exercise of power on Cloudflare’s part. When I thought about it more deeply, however, I realized that realizing vision I painted in May’s The Agentic Web and Original Sin would actually require audacious action like Cloudflare’s. — Ben Thompson Greatest of All Talk in Las Vegas. One would think that basketball news slows down in the summer, but in fact, the news continues well into July, it just gets much nerdier. NBA Summer League is the epicenter of the nerdery, and Greatest of All Talk has been on the scene in Las Vegas for the past week. For those interested in a scouting report of number one pick Cooper Flagg, Ben Golliver and I spent 45 minutes talking through his performance on an episode Sunday. As for everything else—speculation surrounding LeBron’s future, whether the league will expand to Las Vegas and Seattle, misgivings with the current CBA among NBA players, and a mid-summer league “Chesstival” hosted by Magnus Carlsen and Derrick Rose (I told you it was nerdy)—Ben and I covered the scene from top to bottom on two more episodes later in week. Whether you come for Cooper Flagg or chess, GOAT is a great listen for the weekend.  — Andrew Sharp How We Cool Computers. Since the dawn of computing, engineers have been struggling to keep computers from overheating. This week’s episode of Asianometry traces that history, beginning with an era of vacuum tubes that were literally cooled with air conditioning, and arriving at the Gen AI era, when Nvidia’s H100 and B200 accelerators now emit 700 to 1,000 watts of heat apiece and companies all over the world are experimenting with hybrid methods to cool chips. Altogether the episode was a great look at the history underlying a challenge that most people never think about, and one that will be central to the future of AI infrastructure, energy costs, and the tension between performance and efficiency that has defined computing from the beginning. Check out the YouTube video here, or if you’re on the move this weekend, all Stratechery subscribers can listen to the episode as a podcast. — AS Stratechery Articles and Updates Google and Windsurf, Stinky Deals, Chesterton’s Fence and the Silicon Valley Ecosystem — Windsurf’s founders and IP are going to Google in the latest stinky deal that is downstream of regulator’s recklessly messing the startup ecosystem.
