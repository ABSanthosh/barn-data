  "text": "Pop Mart's ugly-cute critter has gone viral around the world—but will its little furry legs outurn the fad? The latest drop from Pop Mart’s the Monsters collection might be its most ambitious yet: putting the blind-box darling Labubu into a funky foodie product line that might turn off existing fans. With the Monsters: Wacky Mart, Kasing Lung’s original intention with the mischievous creature shines in a way that might appeal more to vinyl art collectors. Here they give Gremlins energy as they get into munchy mayhem in milk cartons or tempura shrimp. It’s a distinct move that leans into Labubus being more than just the keychain trend they’re now known for, but will fad chasers follow behind? Labubu has been carving its niche in a very interesting way since going viral all over the world. You’d think the plush keychain fashion craze would have a rapidly expiring shelf life, but it’s seemingly as strong as ever. Cher was seen rocking one at a recent film festival appearance, and a designer special edition inspired by zeitgeist tastemaker Pharrell Williams just set a record—$31,250, according to Hype Beast—for the highest-selling Labubu plush at auction. Many hold the opinion that they’re destined for the same fate as the Beanie Babies: that the scarcity arms race and money making releases will eventually burn out. However, there are a few elements at play that might prove their longevity. It brings me no pleasure to bring up Minions, those ugly yellow big-eyed, overalls-wearing slaves to evil that just won’t die. Their gibberish haunts me when I visit Universal Studios theme parks and I bless the days my child goes without discovering them. I’m well aware they’re numbered. When they were introduced in the Despicable Me franchise from Universal and Illumination in 2010, their toys and merch sold like crazy for years. They outshone the film’s main characters as initially they were just side characters who you’d think would have just faded away as one of the most cursed things to happen to animation. No, we’re five movies and two theme park rides deep now, with a new one on the way with the Minions at the center. We have lived through collectibles and streetwear merch collabs for kids, adults, and pets. Hell, Pop Mart even has their own Minions line. They’re not going anywhere. But Labubu doesn’t come from a movie, right? In the ever-evolving landscape of pop culture phenomena, the Labubu has shared a similar trajectory as the Minions. Labubu and the other Monsters bring out that same cuteness aggression—though I disagree about the Minions being cute—and Lung’s lore around Labubu is ripe for expanded storytelling. It could very well spin off into any sort of entertainment medium for fantasy animation fans (like us here). And honestly they deserve it more than the “banana-this-and-banana-that” gaggle of goggle-wearing idiots. Another example is Trolls. Those neon-haired, alien-looking, gem-belly-buttoned dolls were the blueprint before Beanie Babies of popular collector madness that transcended their niche. And they eventually became a hit movie franchise for Universal as well, though their toys never reached the same height of fandom as they did at the end of the last century. In theory, Labubu could see the same opportunities. The plush keychain fad has hit its global fever pitch. At this point we’ll be seeing if it can endure. Finding a Labubu is just as hard as ever. I finally got my hands on a new one for my collection thanks to my husband using his San Diego Comic-Con Hall H overnight line skillset to make the opening of a local Pop Mart in our area. But in other places such as Japan, the fad is not anything new, especially in one of the world’s biggest Gachapon capitals. Pop Mart is set to open more locations there soon to see if it catches on. As of now, peak Labubu popularity remains in the larger markets of China, the U.S., and the UK. Even if you visit the Pop Mart theme park Popland in China, you’ll be hard-pressed to find any product but can at least enjoy the live entertainment featuring Labubu and the rest of the characters in the Monsters universe. We don’t have any opportunity to meet any Labubus stateside yet (though a Lafufu knock-off did make an iconic appearance at LA’s “No Kings” protest), but the keychains have hit their “cringe tacky promotional stunt” era, as seen in a recent social media post showing the cast of F1 unboxing Labubu blind boxes. © Warner Bros Instagram In the U.K., Labubus are back on sale after a pause due to brawls breaking out in lines between collectors and flippers. Yet challenges remain because of that aspect; market dynamics are shifting because flippers hoard so much product at exorbitant prices. The new rules for the U.K. sales involve getting one through a random lottery, which is as not-fun as it sounds. So either Pop Mart makes more product, undermining the very scarcity game that makes it a luxury accessory, or finds better solutions. With the new Wacky Mart release, is the brand hitting oversaturation with a collection that might not appeal to the masses mad at the plushes dripping out at a slow pace through its retailers? Maybe. In the long run it might not matter to the franchise, which can easily find ways to extend its virality into a core fandom through other mediums. It’s a future that fantasy creature fans can hope for, especially if they’ve felt left out of having a new character to embrace. For myself, Labubu came along when I was looking for something to be into while I began my journey as a parent and that’s a core experience that makes the character feel timeless to me. Whether its a fleeting fashion moment or a promising start to a new universe in Pop Culture, Kasing Lung’s elf creatures might just mischief their way to being more. Want more io9 news?
