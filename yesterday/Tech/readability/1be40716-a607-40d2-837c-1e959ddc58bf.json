  "text": "This year marks a significant change in the air for Superman. Along with James Gunn’s upcoming movie, DC Comics is offering a massive shakeup to the status quo, and with a big get from its distinguished competition: like Brian Michael Bendis before him, Dan Slott, a longtime writer for Marvel’s Spider-Man and Fantastic Four comics, will take on the Man of Steel. Slott will team with artist Rafael Albuquerque and colorist Marcelo Maiolo on Superman Unlimited, a new monthly comic set to kick off in May. Billed as a “driving force” for what’s to be a “Summer of Superman,” the book kicks off with an asteroid filled with Green Kryptonite crash-landing on Earth. Naturally, this kicks off an arms race for the criminal underworld, and parties like Intergang are very keen to get their hands on Superman’s biggest weakness. For Superman, he’ll adjust to this new paradigm shift by “forging new alliances, new tech and new tactics.” Things are also changing for his friends and loved ones at the Daily Planet. After merging with Morgan Edge’s Galaxy Communications, the outlet has become a multimedia platform that prominently features characters that’ll be the film—like Jimmy, Steve Lombard, and Cat Grant—and also includes a new IT specialist in Tee-nah, King Solovar’s goddaughter from Gorilla City. In a statement to DC, Slott said he, Albuquerque, and Maiolo will “take Superman—and you—to places you’ll want to escape to every month. Millions of surprising ideas for him, Lois, the supporting cast, classic rogues, and all-new friends and foes, too.” Superman Unlimited will kick off May 21, and will be set up with a “Zero Issue” in DC’s Free Comic Book Day issue on May 3. According to DC, the “Summer of Superman” will include ongoing and limited books for fellow Supers like Supergirl, Superboy, and Krypto. Want more io9 news?
