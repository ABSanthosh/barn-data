  "text": "Fans of the beloved Ludo Studio animated show about a family of Heeler dogs are hungry for more. It’s hard to believe it’s been a year since Bluey concluded its most recent season. It wasn’t meant to be a series finale but definitely felt like one. Creator Joe Brumm announced that while he’s leaving the show, Bluey will go on—but it still feels a bit like it’s been left hanging in the air. Sure, we’ve gotten mini-sodes with mere crumbs of what the Heelers and friends are doing, but it’s starting to seem like that might be it until the Bluey film, which Brumm is directing as his last hurrah with the globally beloved family franchise. That’s not stopped fans from hoping to hear more on the TV front from Disney+ and BBC One, especially since both outlets are seemingly eager to continue collaborating with Ludo Studio. Recently Disney announced it would have Bluey characters make appearances on select Disney Cruises and other Disney Experiences at the parks. Fandom retailers are also well aware of the Bluey demand. BoxLunch debuted an all-ages fashion drop inspired by the show that’s perfect for Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, and really any day for Bluey fans. The attention to detail, from apparel to decor, is impressive. I am obsessed with this pillow celebrating Bingo’s advice to her daughters: © BoxLunch Even still, the drought of more episodes could cause some Muffin Heeler-sized fits of impatience among fans, who will at least be glad to know that “Burgerdog”, the earworm from the mini-sode, will be getting a vinyl release. Bluey‘s music is part of what makes the show so incredible, so all the adults in my kid’s life who are record store connoisseurs will be sent out to hunt for that particular release. The show’s music takes center stage in “Bluey in Concert,” which fans far from Bluey’s World in Brisbane could enjoy via a recent livestream. I’m not sure if the kids were short or sleeping, but that crowd was filled with adults who enthusiastically showed up because they wanted to. The evening stream was headlined by Joff Bush, the show’s composer. The runtime of the stage set might have been short, but for the 20 minutes of its entirety I was transported to Bluey Coachella at Bluey’s World filled with simpler joys and imagining creek trips. I may have thrown a blanket on and some sunglasses  to make my baby laugh while doing the Granny dance. The live stream was such a treat, from seeing fans dress as the Grannies for their theme song, to getting tired out by the fiery circle dance. But hearing Meg Washington, the voice of Calypso, take the stage and perform “Lazarus Drug,” the tear-inducing song from Bluey‘s season finale “The Sign,” was also very cathartic for the crowd of mostly parents genuinely in the moment. Because while the show is someone’s childhood, it makes adults (parents or not) think of their core memories with their loved ones too. That’s the power of animation, a medium that transcends the “family” genre box it’s lumped into when it speaks to everyone. Watch the live stream re-play below: Want more io9 news?
