  "text": "With all the noise from the lead-up to the 2024 US Presidential election next week, you’d be forgiven for having missed some of the trailers that came out over the last few days. Not to worry; I’ve got you covered for some of the best ones.This week’s trailers included a teaser for Netflix’s second season of Squid Game, a new haunted house horror film from Steven Soderbergh, and a look at Star Wars: Skeleton Crew. Daniel Craig showed up in a trailer for a new A24 movie called Queer. Squid Game season 2Squid Game is finally returning for its second season soon, and in a new teaser, Lee Jung-jae’s Gi-hun looks like he’s preparing to stage an uprising. Whatever happens, it looks like the season will be a bloody, violent return for the dystopian competition on December 26th.Star Wars: Skeleton CrewI’m very excited that Jude Law’s Star Wars debut, Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, is essentially a swashbuckling pirate adventure. The vibes it’s throwing off feel like a nice blend of The Goonies and Star Trek: Prodigy, and I’m certainly ready. The series debuts December 3rd on Disney Plus.PresenceThe moody trailer for Steven Soderbergh’s haunted house horror film Presence doesn’t show the supernatural figure that’s terrorizing Lucy Liu and her suburban family. That’s because it all takes place from the perspective of the ghost itself, which I didn’t realize until I read Variety’s write-up of this trailer. It’s already an eerie preview, but knowing that made it much more so on my second viewing. The movie hits theaters on January 24th.QueerLuca Guadagnino’s Queer, based on William Burroughs’ semi-autobiographical novel of the same name, stars Daniel Craig as William Lee, an American expat who lives in 1950s Mexico City and falls for a younger man named Eugene (Drew Starkey). Having already gotten showings at the Venice Film Festival, some reviews have praised it for Daniel Craig’s performance and Guadagnino’s “trippy” direction. Queer releases on November 27th.Xenoblade Chronicles XNintendo continued to not reveal the successor to the Switch in a batch of announcements this week that included the surprise launch of a new music streaming app that only plays Nintendo songs, the release of Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp as a paid app, and a remaster of Xenoblade Chronicles X, a 2015 Monolith Soft action RPG. The game will be available on March 20th, 2025, for the Nintendo Switch.Mario \u0026 Luigi: BrothershipMario \u0026 Luigi: Brothership got a new trailer this week, backed by a banger of a sea shanty that’s been stuck in my head all day today. The latest game in the Mario \u0026 Luigi RPG series puts the brothers on a seafaring adventure that continues to make the Switch an excellent Nintendo console for Mario RPG games. It’s available November 7th.",
