  "text": "As the number of computers mounted, Chapman began stacking them on shelves around her residence, labeling them with sticky notes so she could remember which \"worker\" and company controlled which machine. When Chapman's home was searched, FBI agents took photos of her setup, which is... something to behold, really. Chapman's origin story is a sad one. According to her public defender, her childhood was marked by \"her father’s infidelity, alcoholism, and emotional absence.\" Chapman was placed in 12 different schools across multiple states before she graduated high school, \"leaving her socially isolated, bullied, and unable to form lasting friendships or a sense of belonging.\" She also suffered \"severe and escalating violence from her older brother, who repeatedly beat and choked her, held a shotgun to her chest, and once left her so visibly bruised that her school intervened.\" And she was \"sexually abused at various points in her childhood and adolescence by family members, peers, and even individuals she believed to be friends.\" Unfortunately, Chapman's poor choice to involve herself with the North Koreans inflicted plenty of pain on others, too, including those whose identity was stolen. One victim told the court that the crime \"left me feeling violated, helpless, and afraid,\" adding: Although identity theft is not a physical assault, the psychological and financial damage is lasting. It feels like someone broke into my life, impersonated me, and left me to pick up the pieces. There is a lingering fear that my information is still out there, ready to be misused again. The stigma of being a fraud victim also weighs heavily; I have had to explain myself to banks, creditors, and sometimes even to people I know. There is an ongoing sense of vulnerability and lack of control. In addition to her 8.5-year sentence, Chapman will serve three years of \"supervised release,\" must forfeit $284,555 that was meant for the North Koreans, and must repay $176,850 of her own money. Such \"remote work\" scams have become increasingly common over the last few years, most originating from North Korea, and the FBI has released repeated guidance on what to look for when hiring remote workers.",
