  "text": "It’s hard to believe that when I first saw Lindsay Lohan in Freaky Friday, we were both teenagers—and now, with Freakier Friday out this summer, we’re both moms. It’s so wild! The whiplash of “oh my god, it’s happening” hit super hard as I was watching the new Freakier Friday trailer today. Lohan’s character Anna is now a successful musician, and Jamie Lee Curtis is back as Tess, her therapist mom, in the sequel to a family fave I share with my own mother. I used to sing along to the Pink Slip (Anna’s band) songs, and when I recently rewatched the film surprised myself at how I still know all the lyrics to “Take Me Away.” So seeing that the sequel’s body-swap hijinks happen at the band’s party (I clocked the logo immediately) makes me even more excited to see how it all unfolds. This time, the freakier part of Friday is that there are four characters involved: Anna and Tess swap bodies with Anna’s teenaged daughter and her teenaged soon-to-be-stepdaughter. The mom and daughter lesson gets passed on to Anna and her teen, which makes me feel old. Oddly Tess and stepdaughter swap too, which is weird, but we hope they pull that off because she’s an outlier.  It makes sense that it happens to Anna and her kid because last time around, Anna was super rebellious and a handful, at least according to Tess, who “just didn’t understand” her. It’s a timeless trope, as plenty of us have been there, and it seems like just yesterday too. I swear I had the same Hot Topic fishnet sleeves made from cut-up leggings, worn underneath a tee with that same studded belt and loop bracelets Lohan donned in the first movie. Even more unbelievable yet is how you can walk into a Hot Topic now and find all of those items as fashion has come full circle. I hope we get to see Anna’s daughter mirror her mom when she was a teen, but it’s pretty uncertain based off the trailer. We don’t get too much of the mother-daughter dynamic here, but it will be interesting to see how the relationships evolve in a quad Freaky Friday situation. The opening has Anna and Tess being told their lifelines have intersected and are warned the lesson may return. In a blink or you’ll miss it moment, the first film’s fortune cookie-giving mother of the Chinese restaurant owner appears next to the DJ (who looks like she could be her granddaughter)—so we wonder if she’s behind the mystic hijinks once again. Having lived generational lessons with my own mom, who does like to meddle in the lives of those she cares about, I’m so excited to see this with her. © Disney While this trailer went for a more nostalgic tone, introducing who’s back among the characters—like the band, the mean professor, and of course hot Jake from high school (Chad Michael Murray reprises the role)—there’s not much known about the story. It’s also unclear if Jake’s the baby daddy to Anna’s teen, but we also know Manny Jacinto is in the cast, and he’s rumored to play Anna’s current beau. And yes we’re blessed with his gun show. We’re so grateful for that shot of those biceps and it makes this movie feel even more aimed at millennial moms. I can’t believe I’m one now—I used to chase my annoying little brother out of the room when I’d pretend to be in Pink Slip, and now he’s an uncle who towers over me. Freaky indeed.
