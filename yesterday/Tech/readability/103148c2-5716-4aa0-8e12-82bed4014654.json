  "text": "Netflix says it had a big audience for its live NFL games on Christmas Day, with Nielsen ratings designating them “the most-streamed NFL games in US history.” The Kansas City Chiefs and the Pittsburgh Steelers notched a 24.1M AMA (average minute audience), while the Houston Texans and Baltimore Ravens hit 24.3M AMA, totaling nearly 65 million total viewers.Though Netflix buckled under the weight of the more than 60 million households that tuned into the boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul last month, its systems mostly held up during the two NFL games and star-studded performances from Mariah Carey and Beyoncé. Netflix has also confirmed it will add a standalone replay of the “Beyoncé Bowl” halftime performance to the service later this week after it registered 27 million live viewers — the game’s peak viewership. Now, the league’s broadcast deal will keep Christmas Day games on Netflix for at least the next two years. The NBA, which has traditionally aired basketball without competition from the NFL on the holiday, said that despite the competing Netflix broadcasts, its slate of games delivered the “most-watched Christmas Day in five years, averaging 5.25 million viewers per game in the U.S.” All five games up year-over-year, with viewership overall up 84 percent from 2023.On Wednesday, the NFL offered a preliminary glimpse at viewership, saying the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Pittsburgh Steelers had already become the second most popular live title on Netflix and that one-third of Netflix’s viewers at the time were watching that game.",
