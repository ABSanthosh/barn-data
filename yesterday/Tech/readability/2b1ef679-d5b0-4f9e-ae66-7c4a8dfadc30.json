  "description": "The Federal Trade Commission has finally given up the ghost on challenging Microsoft's $68.7 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard. \"The Commission has determined that the public interest is best served by dismissing the administrative litigation in this case,\" the agency said in an order issued today. The federal regulator had attempted to block Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard both before and after the deal closed back in October 2023. The FTC just lost out on its latest appeal against the merger earlier this month. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the FTC had not successfully argued several points of its case for a preliminary injunction against the merger, which is one of the biggest acquisitions in the video game industry. \"Today’s decision is a victory for players across the country and for common sense in Washington, D.C. We are grateful to the FTC for today’s announcement,\" Microsoft President and Vice Chair Brad Smith posted on X about the dismissal.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-ftc-will-finally-stop-challenging-microsofts-purchase-of-activision-blizzard-225212384.html?src=rss",
