Founded in 2023, Portal has launched three product lines and signed over 50 commercial partnerships, the company said. Beyond defence applications, the dual-use tech could also aid in drug discovery and medicine by enabling scientists to quickly identify and characterise proteins.¬† NIF led the Series A investment¬†alongside Berlin-based Earlybird Venture Capital.
