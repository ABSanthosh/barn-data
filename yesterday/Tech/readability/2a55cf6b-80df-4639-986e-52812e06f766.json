  "text": "Fallout is going beyond New Vegas. Monday, Prime Video announced that season two of the hit video game adaptation is debuting in December 2025, and that it will be followed by a third season too. “The holidays came a little early this year—we are thrilled to be ending the world all over again for a third season of Fallout,” executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy said in a press release. “On behalf of our brilliant cast and crew, our showrunners Geneva [Robertson-Dworet] and Graham [Wagner], and our partners at Bethesda, we’re grateful to our incredible collaborators at Amazon MGM Studios and to the amazing fans as we continue our adventures in the wasteland together.” Season one of the show ended with Lucy (Ella Purnell) and the Ghoul (Walton Goggins) teaming up to attempt to find the leaders of Vault-Tec, the company responsible for everyone’s favorite Fallout chambers, which also just so happened to cause the apocalyptic event that led to their use. And all signs point to that happening in New Vegas, one of the most notable locations from the hit video game series. “We are absolutely thrilled that our global Prime Video customers will be able to delve deeper into the wonderfully surreal and captivating world of Fallout,” Vernon Sanders, global head of television for Amazon MGM, said. “Jonah, Lisa, Geneva, and Graham have done an exceptional job bringing this beloved video game franchise to vivid life on Prime Video. Together with our amazing partners at Bethesda Games and Bethesda Softworks, we are delighted to announce a third season of Fallout, well ahead of the much-anticipated debut of season two.” It will have been about a year and a half between seasons when season two debuts, so a 2027 premiere seems likely for season three. Will things go beyond that? I guess we’ll find out once we see where season two goes. Are you excited to return to the world of Fallout? What game stories would you like to see adapted? Want more io9 news? Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what’s next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who.",
