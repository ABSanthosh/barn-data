  "description": "The ratio of vacant U.S. jobs to jobless workers \"has fallen from a record of 2 in 2022 to 1.1 in November,\" reports the Wall Street Journal — which adds that \"the balance of power between employers and employees has shifted as the labor market has gone from white-hot to merely solid.\" JP Morgan's five-days-a-week return-to-office mandate was only the beginning, with big companies like Amazon and Dell \"tightening remote-work policies, shrinking travel budgets and cutting back on benefits... Companies are slashing perks such as college-tuition assistance and time off for a sick pet... \" 76% of [U.S.] job growth in the past year has been in healthcare and education, leisure and hospitality, and government. In fields such as finance, information, and professional and business services, job growth has been far weaker. While a shift in leverage to employers might have shown up in layoffs or wage cuts in the past, now it is more subtle, often in changes to working conditions. For example, knowing that some workers will quit rather than return to the office, some companies are ending remote work as a way of trimming payroll. \"Quiet quitting\" — workers who slacked off rather than quit — has been replaced by \"quiet cutting\" — employers who cut jobs without actually announcing job cuts... Michael Gibbs, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, said the new mandates might simply be a message to workers that times have changed. \"Firms are trying to reset expectations,\" he said... [After refusing her employers return-to-office four-days-a-week mandate, Mayrian] Sanz, who now works as an independent business and leadership coach, said she applied for 25 to 30 jobs listed as remote but initially got no responses. When some hiring managers finally replied, they had a surprise: Jobs listed as remote would now be in-office. \"They just say everything is shifting to going back to the office,\" she said. Among tech workers, the share receiving perks such as paid volunteer hours, college-tuition reimbursement, free financial advice and mental-health programs all declined by about 4 percentage points in 2024 from 2023, according to Dice, a technology job board. Average bonuses fell by more than $800, from $15,011 to $14,194. Meanwhile, Netflix has quietly backed off from its unlimited parental leave in a child's first year, The Wall Street Journal reported last month. A company spokesman said at that time that employees have the freedom and flexibility to determine what is best for them. The article notes that \"The actual impact of return-to-office directives remains to be seen,\" with economists \"skeptical\" the directives make companies more productive and faster-growing: Many workers now being called in were already spending some time in their cubicles. Nicholas Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford University, said most of the benefits of collaboration can be achieved with just a few days in the office, while some tasks that require concentration are better done at home. Elsewhere the Wall Street Journal that looking for a job \"is set to get less miserable this year,\" since roughly two-thirds of U.S. employers plan to add permanent roles within the next six months, \"according to a new survey by staffing and consulting firm Robert Half.\" And Computerworld notes that the IT unemployment rate is now just 2% in the U.S. (according to official figures from the US Bureau of Labor statistics).
