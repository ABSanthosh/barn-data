And if you just can’t get enough of all things I/O, you can dive deeper into the news with NotebookLM.This notebook includes tons of sources, including YouTube videos of keynote speeches and product demonstrations, blog links, press releases and more. Everything’s uploaded there so you can ask NotebookLM to help you make sense of it. You can explore I/O announcements in a Mind Map, FAQ or listen to an Audio Overview. Ask the notebook questions (\"what were the top Android announcements?\") or instruct NotebookLM to generate a summary in any format (\"draft a social post on Gemini news\"). (Just remember, like all AI, NotebookLM can generate inaccuracies.)We also previewed Video Overviews today — you can head to YouTube now and see the AI-generated summary of our keynote as well as one focused on developer updates.",
