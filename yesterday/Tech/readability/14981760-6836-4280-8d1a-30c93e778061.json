We have three practice sessions, one qualifying session, and the main race in the lineup. However, you might struggle to find ways to watch it live. Paid channels aren’t an option for many — they’re way too expensive. But can you watch the F1 Japanese Grand Prix on a free channel? Believe it or not, the answer is yes! SRF will broadcast the event for you. In this guide, we’ll explain how to access the TV channel from anywhere and enjoy the thrilling race, as well as qualifying. Free Channel That Broadcasts the Japanese Grand Prix As said, SRF is a free broadcaster of all Formula 1 races. Unlike F1 TV Pro, which charges you a fortune, SRF is a lesser-known, free TV channel from Switzerland. According to its programme, it streams the F1 Japanese Grand Prix live in Full HD from start to finish. © SRF.ch This means you’ll be able to tune in on the 5th of April and tune out on the 6th of April after the main race ends. SRF works only in Switzerland, and that’s an issue for many “outsiders”. However, as it’s from Switzerland, it doesn’t offer English commentary. On the brighter side, SRF offers a Full HD coverage of the entire event and doesn’t require an account, so you can watch the full race for free instantly. The problem is that SRF is geo-restricted, as said, but that can be overcome with a Swiss IP address. Wondering how to get it? You don’t have to think — people online have already done that for you. Watch Japanese GP for free with NordVPN How to Watch the F1 Japan Grand Prix Live for Free? The workaround revolves around a VPN, or Virtual Private Network.
