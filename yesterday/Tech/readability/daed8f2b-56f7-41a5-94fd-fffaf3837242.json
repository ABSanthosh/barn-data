With less than three weeks to go until the 2024 general election, voter registration deadlines have already passed in many states. Depending where you live, you might still be in luck.Voter registration policies vary from state to state, with some offering several methods to register. Some states might also set the cutoff date for registration a few weeks prior to the general election, while others will let you sign up as late as Election Day. Below, you can check an interactive map for details about each state's deadline and click through to its voter registration page for more details.In 2022, a Pew Research analysis found that, while the number had surged in recent election cycles, the number of eligible voters participating in US elections still lagged behind many other developed nations. In 2020, 62.8% of people eligible to vote took part in the US presidential election, behind the rates for national elections in places like France, Australia, India, South Korea, Mexico, Germany, Brazil and Israel. Therefore, registering new voters has long been a major goal of political organizers. For more information about the election, here's how to find out what's on your ballot and what the candidates are saying about the child tax credit.When is Election Day 2024?Election Day is set to take place on Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024. General elections have been held on the first Tuesday in November since Congress made it official in 1845. As of Friday, Oct. 18, there's less than three weeks left until Election Day.You may not have to wait until Nov. 5, however, to vote. You may have the option to vote before Election Day if your state has early voting. The method of early voting and the window of time when you can do it vary greatly depending on where you live, so check out our breakdown of early voting information by state.How do I register to vote locally?Every state that requires voter registration offers the ability to register in person at an official designated location. The specific place that you need to visit to register varies, so the best way to get an answer is by calling either your state board of elections office or your local city or town government office. The site USA.gov can help direct you to the right office with its state and local election offices page.How long do I have to register to vote?States handle voter registration typically in one of three ways: In-person at an official designated location, by mail or online. Depending on your state, you might have access to all three options or just two. Your state of residence will also determine your registration deadline, after which you might not be able to vote in this year's general election.Only one state -- North Dakota -- doesn't do voter registration at all. If you're a North Dakotan you have no deadline to worry about. Instead, you need to bring one of the valid pieces of ID to prove that you are eligible to vote.For US citizens living abroad, the deadline for registration is the same as the state where they are eligible to vote. However, embassies have encouraged these citizens to complete their Federal Post Card Application well in advance, keeping in mind that transit to the US can sometimes take several weeks.As of the end of Monday, Oct. 21, registration deadlines have passed in eight more states, including all options in Alabama, Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Wyoming. In New York, it was the last day to have your mail-in registration postmarked by, and it was also the last day for mail and online registration in Michigan, though both states will allow in-person registration and voting through Election Day. California was the last state with deadlines passing on Monday, though same-day in-person registration and voting is also available there through the general election, though be aware that this will be a provisional ballot that won't be officially counted until your registration is verified.In all, deadlines have now passed 42 states and Washington, DC, including the key battlegrounds of Arizona, Georgia, Minnesota North Carolina, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Next week, more deadlines will pass in places like Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Washington.Some states where deadlines have passed might still have certain registration options available, including in-person voting all the way through Election Day.
