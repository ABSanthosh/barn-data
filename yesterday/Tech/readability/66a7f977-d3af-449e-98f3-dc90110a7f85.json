  "description": "The Miami Herald reports: Cuba's electrical grid shut down again early Saturday, leaving the island without electricity after authorities tried but failed to restore power following an earlier nationwide blackout on Friday. The island's Electric Union reported a second \"total outage\" at 6:15 a.m., just hours after officials reported they had restored power in a few \"microsystems\" all over the island... The country has been going through its worst economic crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union, and the government lacks money to buy oil in the international market to meet domestic demand. Cubans irked by the daily blackouts defied the country's Draconian laws punishing criticism of the government and left several comments in official news outlets calling for government officials to resign. The second outage will likely exacerbate public frustration as food begins to spoil because of the lack of refrigeration. Two hours ago, Reuters reported that Cuba's government \"said on Saturday it had made some progress in gradually re-establishing electrical service across the island, including to hospitals and parts of the capital Havana...\" \"Most of Cuba's 10 million people, however, remained without electricity on Saturday afternoon.\" Traffic lights were dark at intersections throughout Havana, and most commerce was halted... Cuban officials have said even if the immediate grid collapse is resolved, the electricity crisis will continue. Cuba produces little of its own crude oil, and fuel deliveries to the island have dropped significantly this year, as Venezuela, Russia and Mexico, once important suppliers, have reduced their exports to Cuba. Mexico experienced a historic drop in production, according to the New York Times, while Venezuela is selling its oil to foreign companies to ease its own economic crisis: The experts had warned for years: Cuba's power grid was on the verge of collapse, relying on plants nearly a half-century old and importing fuel that the cash strapped Communist government could barely afford... Cuban economists and foreign analysts blamed the crisis on several factors: the government's failure to tackle the island's aging infrastructure; the decline in fuel supplies from Venezuela, Mexico and Russia; and a lack of capital investment in badly needed renewable systems, such as wind and solar. Jorge Pi単on, a Cuban-born energy expert at the University of Texas at Austin, highlighted that Cuba's electricity grid relies on eight very large power plants that are close to 50 years old. \"They have not received any operational maintenance much less capital maintenance in the last 12 to 15 years,\" he said, adding that they have a lifetime of only 25-30 years. \"So, number one, it's a structural problem, they are breaking down all the time and that has a domino effect,\" he said. Compounding the problems, Cuba burns crude oil as a fuel for its plants. Experts said Cuba's own crude oil production is very heavy in sulfur and metals that can impair the thermoelectric combustion process. \"So they have to be constantly repairing them, and they're repairing them with Band-Aids,\" said Mr. Pi単on... \"If they can't turn these plants back on there is a concern that this could turn into another mass exodus,\" said Ricardo Herrero, the director of the Cuba Study Group in Washington. \"They are really short on options,\" he added.
