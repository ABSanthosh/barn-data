  "text": "Man, it's a hot one in a lot of places around the US right now, thanks in part to the heat dome that has taken hold in the atmosphere. Thomas is a native of upstate New York and a graduate of the University at Albany. As a member of CNET's How To team, he writes about the intersection of policy, information and technology, and how you can best be served in that area. Outside of work, he can most often be found watching too many movies, reading too much, drinking too much coffee, or spending time with his cats. It's been a hot summer for a lot of areas already. As much as the heat here in upstate New York has me cooped up inside with the air conditioner blasting, it's nothing compared to other parts of the US now impacted by one of the summer's freakiest weather patterns: the heat dome.If that's a new phrase to you, keep reading and I'll break down what a heat dome is and what causes it, and for more help, read CNET's list of hacks for keeping your home cool in the summer.What is a heat dome?Think of a heat dome as similar to putting a lid on a pot or a frying pan while cooking something, Alex Lamers of the National Weather Service told NPR.A heat dome is what happens when a high-pressure system lingers, causing hot air to become trapped under it, resulting in prolonged temperature spikes. Just like how putting a lid on a pot or pan traps the heat and cooks the food faster. Except in this case, the food is you and me. This is made worse by the fact that high pressure systems are known to cause dry weather, which can also contribute to hotter temperatures.According to the heat map provided on the National Integrated Heat Health Information System's official website, heat risks are elevated for most of the country between the Midwest and Lower Mississippi Valley regions and the East Coast, with eastern North Carolina, central Virginia, the Pittsburgh area, southeast Pennsylvania, southeast Maryland, most of New Jersey and almost all of Delaware being under extreme heat warnings. In the hardest-hit areas, temperatures may go as high as 115 degrees, while others will hover between 95 and 100 degrees. All around, it's the kind of weather than can make the prospect of a power outage a life-or-death scenario.How long does a heat dome last?I wish I had better news for you.Unfortunately, heat domes are known to last anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, all dependent on how long it takes for the high pressure system in a given region to move on or dissipate. While AccuWeather reported on June 24 that incoming rainstorms will provide some areas with relief, not every region will be so lucky. Some areas will see the heat dome break down more gradually. So if you were hoping to tough things out without putting the AC on, it's probably time to reconsider.Does climate change make heat domes worse?Oh, absolutely.Speaking to Time Magazine for a report on the current heat wave, Bill Gallus, a professor of meteorology at Iowa State University, said that cause-and-effect question was \"one of the easier (questions) to answer.\" Heat domes, he explained, are one of the more likely consequences of worsening climate change, even more so than other related weather events, such as increased tornadoes and stronger hurricanes.\"There's so many things that are complicated and we can't say for sure what climate change is going to do, such as how many hurricanes or tornadoes we get,\" Gallus said. \"But it is likely that we will have more heat domes and probably hotter temperatures in the heat domes.\"How can I avoid a heat dome?As you might be able to tell from all these explanations so far, there's not much to do about a heat dome except to get away from it. This might entail staying inside where it's cool or going away to some other place that isn't suffering under a high-pressure system. Maybe head out to the west coast, where my other CNET colleagues -- whom I am not jealous of and never have been, promise -- insist the weather is positively temperate. Hope you're all having fun out there, guys.Or hey, maybe try the old summertime standby and go see a movie in a nice air-conditioned theater. That new F1 movie looks pretty neat.For more weather tips, check out CNET's guide to saving power during summer heat waves.",
