  "description": "The Elgato Stream Deck is expanding into a hardware-agnostic platform. On Monday, the company unveiled a software version of the programmable shortcut device. Also on tap are a module for integration in third-party products and DIY projects, an Ethernet dock and an updated Stream Deck MK.2 with scissor-switch keys. Stream Deck MK.2 Scissor Keys There's a new version of the popular Stream Deck MK.2. The only difference is that this version ditches membrane keys in favor of scissor-switch ones. Scissor keys (found on many laptops, like modern MacBooks) have a shorter travel distance and sharper actuation than the mushy-feeling ones on the (still available) legacy MK.2. The Stream Deck MK.2 Scissor Keys costs $150. Shipments begin around the beginning of June. Virtual Stream Deck Virtual Stream Deck (VSD) is a software-only counterpart of the classic devices. Like the hardware versions, the VSD includes a familiar grid of programmable shortcut buttons. Anything you'd configure for a device like the Stream Deck MK.2 or XL, you can also do for the VSD. Place the interface anywhere on your desktop, pin it for quick access or trigger it with a mouse click or hotkey. Elgato Presumably to avoid cannibalizing its hardware business, Elgato is limiting the VSD to owners of its devices. Initially, it will only be available to people who have Stream Deck hardware or select Corsair peripherals (the Xeneon Edge and Scimitar Elite WE SE Mouse). The company says the VSD will soon be rolled out to owners of additional devices. The VSD has one frustrating requirement. It only works when one of those compatible accessories is connected to your computer. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use it as a virtual Stream Deck replacement, mirroring your shortcuts while you and your laptop are on the go. That seems like a missed opportunity. Instead, it’s more like a complement to Stream Deck hardware while it’s connected — a way to get more shortcuts than the accessory supports. It’s also a method for Corsair accessory owners to get Stream Deck functionality without buying one. Regardless, Virtual Stream Deck launches with the Stream Deck 7.0 beta software. Stream Deck Modules Elgato Stream Deck Modules can be built into hardware not made by Elgato. So, hobbyists, startups and manufacturers can incorporate the OLED shortcut buttons into their DIY projects or products. The only difference is their more flexible nature. Otherwise, they function the same as legacy Stream Deck products. Stream Deck Modules have an aluminum chassis that's \"ready to drop straight into a custom mount, machine or product.\" They're available in six-, 15- and 32-key variants. The modules begin shipping today. You'll pay $50 for the six-key version, $130 for the 15-key one and $200 for the 32-key variant. (If you're providing them for an organization, Elgato offers volume discounts.) Elgato Network Dock Elgato The Elgato Network Dock gives Stream Deck devices their own Ethernet connections. This untethers the shortcuts from the desktop, allowing for \"custom installations, remote stations and more.\" The Network Dock supports both Power over Ethernet (PoE) and non-PoE networks. You can set up its IP configuration on-device. The dock costs $80 and ships in August.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/elgatos-stream-deck-breaks-free-from-the-companys-hardware-230052921.html?src=rss",
