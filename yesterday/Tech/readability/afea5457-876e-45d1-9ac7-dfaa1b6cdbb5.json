  "text": "Worried about losing your favorite cleaning inspiration after the TikTok ban? We may earn a commission from links on this page. Credit: Instagram As it stands, it looks like TikTok will be banned from app stores on Jan. 19. And while I'm not an expert in government, I am a savvy social media user who knows people are worried about their followers, followed accounts, and saved videos disappearing. If you get your cleaning and organizing inspiration from TikTok—where CleanTokkers have always been popular content creators—you may want to know of comparable Instagram accounts that you can look into as a replacement. Here are seven of my favorites. The best cleaning accounts on InstagramI spend a lot of time going through social media to find cleaning hacks, so I know a thing or two about what makes a solid cleaning video. Here are some of the best cleaning-focused accounts to follow.@cleanwithbeax, 812k followersI love watching the videos on @cleanwithbeax, where Bea Elton makes over homes that are stuffed with clutter, trash, and all-around mess. It's soothing to watch her transform grimy surfaces with a pass of a rag, and even if your home isn't as messy as the ones she deals with, you can always learn something from watching the way she maneuvers her vacuum or the taking note of the products she swears by.@gocleanco, 2.4 million followersThe videos on @gocleanco are more direct, how-to-clean posts interspersed with some inspirational, idealistic ones, like shots of a tidy home or holiday decor. Content creator Sarah McAllister is adept at serving up variety, so I often find myself scrolling past something idyllic and eventually browsing details about the best vacuums for sale online (which is great for when I simply want to absorb cleaning knowledge without having to think too hard about it). @anna_louisa_at_home, 4.3 million followersAnna Louisa, purveyor of @anna_louisa_at_home, is a quality follow. She's the author of the popular book The Five Minute Clean Routine, and her videos are extremely hands-on. She shares product roundups, hack rundowns, and quick tips—and I do mean quick, since her whole cleaning philosophy revolves around not spending too much time at it. The best organizing accounts on InstagramSome of the best content you can consume is less about cleaning and more about organizing. Speaking from experience, when I see someone share a video of how perfectly tidy and well-contained their stuff is, I get inspired to make my own spaces more organized. Organization lends itself to video content, especially, since before-and-afters are so satisfying, so let these inspire you. @mrshinchhome, 4.8 million followersSophie Hinchliffe, aka @mrshinchhome, is one of the most popular organizers out there. I get lost in her calm voiceovers, which accompany videos of her doing tasks like organizing her kids' packed lunches, going over her favorite cleaning and organizing products, and rearranging her home. In addition to great grid posts, her Instagram Stories are full of \"reset\" inspiration and clips of her sprucing up rooms and surfaces. @the.decluttered.mom, 380k followers@the.decluttered.mom is heavy on the inspiration and motivation: The account consistently posts content that gives people space to acknowledge that they're overwhelmed, and then it encourages them to get back in the game. The account has a gentle, helpful approach, and it seems to cheer for anyone who gets off the couch and organizes just one thing. If you need an account to treat you with some kindness instead of shaming you for not living in pristine luxury, this is the one. @organizingspacesbykim, 291k followersThe @organizingspacesbykim account has a video for everything: Tips on how to unpack if you're moving, ideas for organizing a pantry, and even advice on how to organize a barn. Even though I don't have anything like a barn, I still like watching a professional organizing team working through one, and I still pick up great tips on how to use storage containers and make solid decisions about what to keep or get rid of. This account is also excellent if you're looking for specific product recommendations and want to see exactly how they're used before buying them. @tidydad, 379k followers@Tidydad is a personal favorite of mine. Decluttering and organizing are female-dominated content niches, so it's cool to see a dad get in on the action, and it's great to see how the tidy dad himself, Tyler Moore, organizes his New York City apartment, since I, too, live in a small space. Moore, the author of Tidy Up Your Life, shares product reviews and tips that appeal to people with limited space, which makes for compelling and useful content, especially when so many other cleaning influencers appear to live in a palace. Lindsey Ellefson Features Editor Lindsey Ellefson is Lifehacker’s Features Editor. She currently covers study and productivity hacks, as well as household and digital decluttering, and oversees the freelancers on the sex and relationships beat.
