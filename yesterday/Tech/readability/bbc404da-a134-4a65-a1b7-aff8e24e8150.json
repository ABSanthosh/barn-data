Credit: Amazon Prime Day 2025 is here from Tuesday, July 8 to Friday, July 11, and Lifehacker is sharing the best sales based on product reviews, comparisons, and price-tracking tools. Follow our live blog to stay up to date on the best sales we find.Subscribe to our shopping newsletter, Add to Cart, for the best sales sent to your inbox.New to Prime Day? We have a primer on everything you need to know. Sales are accurate at the time of publication, but prices and inventory are always subject to change.If you’re looking for reliable vacuuming with minimal emptying, the Shark AI Ultra is 50% off on Amazon just ahead of Prime Day. With powerful suction, an extra-large self-emptying base, and accurate home mapping, this is one of the most popular smart robot vacuums on the market that stands up against competitors like Roborock. Right now, you can get it for just under $300. Here’s what to know about this deal.  In terms of navigation, it features basic object avoidance and LiDAR mapping, which uses laser light to ensure your home is mapped accurately. However, Amazon reviews on the mapping are mixed. Some users report that the vacuum misses spots or unnecessarily re-cleans areas, requiring the map to be deleted and rebuilt.For performance, the Matrix Clean feature uses a precise grid pattern to pass over dirt and debris multiple times for a deeper clean on carpets and hard floors. You can choose from various suction levels, and most reviewers are impressed with suction quality (especially when it’s set to \"Boost\" mode), although some report issues with it getting stuck on rugs. The battery lasts up to two hours per charge, and the self-cleaning brush roll helps prevent hair and fur from getting tangled.A noteworthy features are the extra large self-emptying dust bin, which can hold up to 60 days of dirt, dust, and pet hair and takes seconds to clean out. Another is the hands-free voice/app control, which is compatible with Alexa or Google Assistant and allows you to activate cleans, set a cleaning schedule, and initiate on-demand cleaning.  What do you think so far? Still, it doesn’t have a mopping function, which might be a dealbreaker to some people. If you’re in the market for a mid-tier robot vacuum that combines ease of use with the convenience of voice control and a larger-than-usual base, but don’t mind the hassle of resetting your map occasionally, the Shark AI Ultra is a safe bet. However, if you’re looking for more high-end features like mopping and auto-wash, you may want to splurge on an all-inclusive model like the Dreame X30 Ultra or a 2-in-1 model from Roborock. Looking for something else? Retailers like Walmart, Best Buy, and Home Depot have Prime Day competition sales that are especially useful if you don’t have Amazon Prime.Walmart’s Prime Day competition sale begins at midnight on July 8 and will include deals up to 50% off. It’s an especially good option if you have Walmart+. Best Buy’s Prime Day competition sale, “Black Friday in July,” runs through Sunday, July 13 and has some of the best tech sales online. It’s an especially good option if you’re a My Best Buy “Plus” or “Total” member.Home Depot extended its 4th of July sale through at least July 9, competing with some amazing deals of its own.
