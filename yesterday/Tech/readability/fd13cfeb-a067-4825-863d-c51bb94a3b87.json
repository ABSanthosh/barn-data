A real-time, conversational, voice-to-search feature right within Google Search.Google app tipster @AssembleDebug on X posted a video of a new feature that Google is currently testing out, which allows users to talk to Google Search within the Google mobile app. Mashable Light Speed Tweet may have been deleted How to use the new AI voice-to-search featureYou must provide a question or search query to Google by speaking into your device — and Google will provide search results in response. You can then ask follow-up questions and Google Search will update in real-time to provide relevant search results for those queries, too.While Google already offers voice-to-search capabilities, it was previously limited to one query at a time. To ask another question, the user had to restart the process by tapping the microphone button. With this new update, voice-to-search will now be contextual and conversational. Once a user starts the process, they can continue to ask follow-ups without further manual input.In return, Google will continuously provide search links and AI-powered summaries in response to those queries.The feature is not yet publicly available in the Google app — and it’s uncertain whether it will be released. However, as OpenAI and other AI companies move toward voice-to-text capabilities, Google will likely also release similar features to keep up, so expect this one, or some version of it, sometime in the near future.",
