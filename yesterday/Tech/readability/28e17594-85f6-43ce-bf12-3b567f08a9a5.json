  "description": "Splitgate 2, the follow-up to the hugely successful 2021 Quake-Portal hybrid concept, is returning to beta. The game launched last month, but developer 1047 Games is pulling it after deciding the release had been rushed. The company doesn't plan to release the project again until 2026. \"We'll be heads down until early next year, rebuilding major parts of the game to capture the spirit of what made Splitgate special,\" the founders said in a post to the game's Reddit community. \"That means reworking progression from the ground up, adding more portals to our maps, simplifying monetization, refocusing on classic game modes you've been asking for, and more, which we’ll share soon.\" Not only will the sequel go back into development, but 1047 Games is also cutting jobs. And that's after it already laid off some team members shortly after Splitgate 2's initial release. The company said it will shut down the servers for the original Splitgate in order to reduce expenses and keep more of its team members employed. 1047 Games has been brutalized in the public eye after co-founder Ian Proulx appeared at Summer Games Fest wearing a hat that read \"Make FPS Great Again,\" which infuriated many of the original Splitgate's players. After the initial stance, posted to the studio's X account on Splitgate 2's release date, that he was both \"not here to apologize\" and that the hat was \"not a political statement,\" Proulx finally landed on the line that it was all basically a publicity stunt. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/splitgate-2-is-yanked-back-to-beta-a-month-after-release-231022772.html?src=rss",
