  "description": "OpenAI is partnering with the California State University (CSU) system to bring ChatGPT Edu to the 23-campus community of 500,000 students, calling it the \"largest implementation of ChatGPT by any single organization or company anywhere in the world.\" Fortune reports: As part of ChatGPT Edu, members of the CSU community will get special access to ChatGPT-4o and advanced research and analysis capabilities. The partnership allows schools to create customizable AI chatbots for any project, like a campus IT help desk bot, financial aid assistant, chemistry tutor, or orientation buddy. CSU also plans to introduce free AI skills training for its students, faculty, and staff as well as connect students with AI-related apprenticeship programs. CSU joins a number of other schools with ChatGPT Edu partnerships, including Arizona State University (AS), The University of Texas, Austin, University of Oxford, Columbia University, and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.
