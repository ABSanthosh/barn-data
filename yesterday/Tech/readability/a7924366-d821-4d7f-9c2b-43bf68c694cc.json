  "description": "CNN looks at \"one field that's really benefitting\" from the use of AI: \"the discovery of new medicines\". The founder/CEO of London-based LabGenius says their automated robotic system can assemble \"thousands of different DNA constructs, each of which encodes a completely unique therapeutic molecule that we'll then test in the lab. This is something that historically would've had to have been done by hand.\" In short, CNN says, their system lets them \"design and conduct experiments, and learn from them in a circular process that creates molecular antibodies at a rate far faster than a human researcher.\" While many cancer treatments have debilitating side effects, CNN notes that LabGenius \"reengineers therapeutic molecules so they can selectively target just the diseased cells.\" But more importantly, their founder says they've now discovered \"completely novel molecules with over 400x improvement in [cell] killing selectivity.\" A senior lecturer at Imperial College London tells CNN that LabGenius seems to have created an efficient process with seamless connections, identifying a series of antibodies that look like they can target cancer cells very selectively \"that's as good as any results I've ever seen for this.\" (Although the final proof will be what happens when they test them on patients..) \"And that's the next step for Labgenius,\" says CNN. \"They aim to have their first therapeutics entering clinics in 2027.\" Finally, CNN asks, if it succeeds is their potential beyond cancer treatment? \"If you take one step further,\" says the company's CEO/founder, \"you could think about knocking out senescent cells or aging cells as a way to treat the underlying cause of aging.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
