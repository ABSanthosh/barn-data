  "text": "For months we’ve known that senseis played by Ralph Macchio and Jackie Chan would be teaming up for a new film set in the Karate Kid universe. But, in a world where the Netflix show Cobra Kai exists, what exactly is this movie? Well, today at New York Comic Con, Sony finally pulled the curtain back a bit on the film which we now know is called Karate Kid Legends. The film stars Ben Wang as Li Fong, a new student that somehow learns martial arts from the likes of Daniel LaRusso (Macchio) and Mr. Han (Chan). Joshua Jackson, Shaunette Renée Wilson, Ming-Na Wen, Aramis Knight, Sadie Stanley, Wyatt Olef, and Jennifer-Lyn Christie are also in the film. Chan and Macchio sent in a video to introduce the first trailer for the film, which was only shown in the room, but said since New York City plays such a large role, it was the perfect place to do so. What we learn from the trailer, or at least can try and discern, is that Mr. Han seemingly takes the lead between the two legacy characters. He speaks about tradition rooted in history mentioning both kung fu and karate. We see him and LaRusso meet, and LaRusso assumes he is looking for Mr. Miyagi. “I did not come looking for Mr. Miyagi,” Han says. “I came looking for you.” We get shots of Li (Wang) walking around New York, getting jumped on the subway, and training with Mr. Han. There’s fighting in the streets as Li is chased by an unknown assailant. Later, as the action builds to its peak and we cut through different training montages with Li and Mr. Han, the trailer climaxes with Li fighting in several matches at a tournament. “Two branches, one tree,” LaRusso says, implying he and Han will combine efforts for something. So we basically know what we could discern from the announcement, but not much more. It’s about the two senseis teaming up somehow. They have a shared history LaRusso isn’t aware of. Li is a student at the center of it. It’s largely based around New York City. That last part, more than anything, teases the answer to the big question: will characters from Cobra Kai, which seemingly ends before this, show up? Probably not, but anything is possible. And while the trailer hasn’t been released publicly yet, we did get a poster. Legends are forever.
