  "text": "Finally, there’s an update on the future of Bluey. Fans of the beloved show, which centers around the everyday adventures of the family of Heeler dogs and their canine community and was created by Joe Brumm and Ludo Studios, now have some answers about what’s next. It’s pretty huge but comes with some bittersweet news. After its pretty final-feeling season finale at the start of the year, which ended with a time jump into Bluey’s future as a mom, fans were left with so many burning questions. Not even the drop of mini-sodes gave us any sort of clue about whether we were getting more Bluey seasons. Thankfully today Ludo Studios announced that it’s official: Bluey is getting a movie! In a statement released on the official website, it’s been confirmed that the BBC and the Walt Disney Company have partnered up with the show’s creators to bring Bluey to the big screen in 2027. The film is set to be CG, which we hope means it will elevate the show’s 2D look—in the style ofThe Wild Robot, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, or Disney’s Wish—and not that it will be fully CG animated. That’s our first gut reaction as fans of the animation, along with the excitement that it’s also staying mostly in-house as a Ludo Studio production in collaboration with BBC Studios, with Brumm on board as the writer and director. The creator shared, “I really enjoyed the experience of working with a longer format on ‘The Sign’ in Series 3, so going even further with a feature film feels like a natural extension of that. I’ve always thought Bluey deserved a theatrical movie. I want this to be an experiential event for the whole family to enjoy together. I’m excited to continue to partner with Cecilia Persson, Tom Fussell and the team at BBC Studios, and Dana Walden, Alan Bergman, and Disney to bring this new Bluey story to the big screen.” However, Bluey: The Movie will mark Brumm’s final touch on the series he created as he’ll be exiting the Bluey team after. In a “trifficult” to read letter he expanded on the reasons why he’ll be leaving after the film. “I always said I wouldn’t keep making the show if I thought I couldn’t make any new season as good as the last,” Brumm wrote. “This would have been the case for me with a potential season four, so I’ve decided to take a break from my involvement in the TV series. In the event I can’t wrap my head around doing more seasons myself, ‘The Sign’ will mark my TV finale for Bluey and I wrote it as such.” The Bluey movie is based on a resurfaced idea he had that inspired his cinematic coda on what’s currently the biggest cartoon on the planet. He continued. “Bluey has completely changed my life. It’s been an immensely satisfying thing to be a part of, more than I can really put into words. To walk away from it while it’s at such a height will seem crazy to some but, for now, I am finding it difficult to reach back genuinely into that four to six year old world and write authentically.” To be honest, that makes at least this Bluey fan a little nervous about the pressure maybe being put on Ludo for more of the show by BBC and Disney. But at least there’s a sense of relief that Bluey might still continue on at its original home, just without Brumm. “My Bluey crew and all the creative people in my life completely understand my decision. Working with that wonderful group of people has been the absolute highlight of my animation career and I hope Bluey on their CV is a badge of pride for them,” he said. “To be clear, this is not an announcement about the end of the show, but it is an acknowledgment that my focus will be on the film.” Brumm emphasizing that this announcement doesn’t mean the show is ending, gives us some hope the showrunning and writing might just now include more voices who love these characters. The year 2027 is a little too far away and it’s hard to imagine a little over a year without more Bluey, so we’ll be keeping an eye out for any word from Disney and Ludo about whether we’re getting another season or more mini-sodes to hold us over in between. We hope that whatever happens, whoever remains Bluey‘s stewards are allowed to be creative and truthful to the characters we love without feeling like a cash grab. If they go full steam ahead on just the film, that would be okay too—just don’t mind us throwing a Muffin Heeler-sized fit over here. Bluey: The Movie will be released in 2027. Want more io9 news?
