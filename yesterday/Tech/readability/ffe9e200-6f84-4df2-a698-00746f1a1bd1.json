First launched in 2024 starting with the EU, this feature is now available in the U.S. after receiving FDA clearance. This feature combines signals from Pixel Watch 3 sensors, AI and signal-processing algorithms to detect loss of pulse events, and automatically prompt a call to emergency services if you are unresponsive.In this first episode, we go behind the scenes with the scientist and product lead who made it happen. They discuss the feature\u0026#x27;s inspiration, the technical hurdles they encountered as well as the critical ethical considerations involved.Subscribe to the Made by Google Podcast on your preferred platform (YouTube, Apple Podcasts, Spotify or Deezer) so you never miss an episode.Loss of Pulse Detection may not detect every instance of a loss of pulse and is not intended for users with preexisting heart conditions or those who require cardiac monitoring. It does not diagnose or treat any medical condition or provide follow-up care. Emergency calling is dependent on call functionality such as your phone or watch being charged and having adequate cellular connectivity. Not available in all countries or regions.",
