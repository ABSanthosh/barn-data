Credit: Getty Images / iStock Editorial / Julie Clopper It's officially summer as of Friday, June 20, which can only mean one thing: Amazon Prime Day is right around the corner. You may be wondering if you should pull the trigger on deals you've been eyeing once the official sale kicks off or wait until the next Prime event. We're here to lay out all the details to help you decide, including when to expect the next Prime Day.When is the next Prime Day?While it may seem like Amazon is holding Prime events every other month, Prime Day technically only happens once a year in the summer. However, Amazon has also been holding another major sale event the past three years in the fall (called Prime Big Deal days in 2024). For all intents and purposes, it's essentially Prime Day 2. Amazon has also held a week-long shopping event in the spring dubbed Amazon's Big Spring Sale for the past two years. The deals aren't quite at the level of Prime Day, but it is considered Amazon's first major savings event of the year.In 2025, Prime Day proper kicks off on Tuesday, July 8 and runs through July 11. That's four full days of deal shopping, marking the longest Prime Day ever. While it's longer than usual by two days, the sale still comes at its usual time: Amazon historically holds the Prime Day event in mid-July with a Tuesday start date. Deals are already floating around ahead of the big event and will likely linger after the event concludes at 2:59 a.m. ET on Saturday, July 12 (aka 11:59 p.m. PT on Friday, July 11). Once the sales dry up, you'll have to wait until the fall for another Prime-centric shopping event. The next Prime Day likely won't take place until October, 2025 (unless, of course, Amazon decides to throw us a curveball) and it won't actually be called Prime Day. In 2022, 2023, and 2024, the October Prime Day-esque event was held the second week of October. If we assume Amazon will stick with a similar schedule as the past few years, the next Prime Day will probably fall on Oct. 7 and 8, 2025. Mashable Deals Are Prime Day deals worth it?It's hard to get excited for a huge shopping event when you have recession on the brain. Everything from electronics to clothes to cleaning supplies has become more expensive this year due to President Donald Trump's tariffs and other general economic chaos.If you're wondering whether or not Prime Day 2025 is actually worth shopping, inflation-weary shoppers can rest assured that Prime Day is notoriously full of great summer deals. Besides Black Friday, it's probably the best time of year to buy Amazon devices, Apple products, robot vacuums, everyday essentials, smartwatches, headphones, and more. If you're in the market for tech, it's certainly worth perusing. Mashable has a hub for Prime Day coverage that can give you more in-depth analysis on what products are worth grabbing and which ones are worth passing on.
