Credit: Image courtesy of Lifestyle Lab/YouTube The Moccamaster Technivorm is one of a million post-Cyber Monday sales. If you're interested in the best tech on sale today, see our page on the best Cyber Monday tech deals that are still active for a broader view of all the best discounts you can get right now. Prices are accurate as of the time of writing, but you can expect them to fluctuate and inventory to sell out, so you may not want to hesitate if you see a sale that grabs you.For the longest time, I was a Keurig guy and was happy with it. I'd load up a K-Cup into my single serve machine, and two minutes later, my morning was saved. There were two problems I had with my Keurig, though: One, I did hate the daily waste of the K-Cups, even with \"recyclable\" ones hitting the scene a few years back. And two, using the machine was a bit of a pain when trying to make more than one cup at once. It'd be nice to fill a travel mug, for example, but one cup wasn't enough and two cups would risk overflowing. And if we had multiple guests over who wanted a cup of coffee, they'd have to wait their turn as my machine brew exactly one serving at a time. So I started to eye a more traditional coffee maker—something that would use one paper filter to make an entire pot of coffee—and if I had guests over or wanted to fill my travel mug, it'd be no problem. While I'd probably be satisfied with a standard coffee maker, I was turned on to the Moccamaster Technivorm, and I never had a chance of looking elsewhere. This thing has it all: It's stylish, it makes 40 ounces of coffee at once, and supposedly optimizes the speed at which the coffee brews to extract the coffee's \"full flavor\" and maximize its \"complexity, taste, and aroma.\" I have no scientific or expert background when it comes to my coffee \"extraction,\" I just like a good cup, and this thing makes a pot of good coffee every time. (This YouTube review does a good job of explaining the machine in greater depth.) As for actually brewing your coffee, I frequent Moccamaster's advice quite often, which is posted online (although it should also come with your machine in paper form). It has the suggested ratio of water to ground coffee for any amount of coffee you're looking to make (I tend to brew a liter at a time, which equates to six scoops of Moccamaster's two tablespoon scoop, or 55 ounces), as well as advice on what to do if the strength is off: If your coffee is too strong, Moccamaster recommends you add hot water. But if it's too weak, Moccamaster doesn't recommend adding more grounds: Instead, it advises \"exploring different coffee varieties or roast profiles to find one more suited to your taste.\" To me, that sounds like a very polite version of \"your coffee's trash, dude.\"From a novice's perspective, everything about this Moccamaster machine is amazing—except the price. The thing retails for $359, which is, the last time I checked, expensive. That's why, when I saw the Technivorm was on sale, I had to write about it. Unfortunately, the deal is already fluctuating. Originally, Amazon had this machine at half price for Black Friday. But since then, that sale has ended. But many colors are still on sale for 30% off. As of writing, that includes Apricot, Black, Orange, Butter Yellow, Candy Apple Red, Pink, Stone Grey, and Yellow Pepper. Rose Gold has a smaller sale, currently priced at $319.95. I'd recommend clicking through the various colors before you buy to see if the deal has shifted at all since this article.
