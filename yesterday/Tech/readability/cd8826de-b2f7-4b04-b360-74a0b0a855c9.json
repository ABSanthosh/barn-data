Vanessa is a lead writer at CNET, reviewing and writing about the latest smartwatches and fitness trackers. She joined the brand first as an on-camera reporter for CNET's Spanish-language site, then moved on to the English side to host and produce some of CNET's videos and YouTube series. When she's not testing out smartwatches or dropping phones, you can catch her on a hike or trail run with her family. Expertise Consumer Technology, Smart Home, Family, Apps, Wearables Apple may have more than just the Apple Watch Series 11 up its sleeve this year. The rumor mill is buzzing with talk that the company's next big launch event could include refreshed versions of the Ultra and SE alongside its next flagship smartwatch. And while the event hasn't been officially announced, it's already shaping up to be a busy season for Apple Watch fans.Some predictions, like new sensors or improved battery life, feel within reach for this cycle, while others, like foldable screens or in-display cameras, may still be years away. From the realistic to the far-fetched, here's a closer look at what could be coming to the Apple Watch lineup this fall.Want a full breakdown of everything Apple just announced, including the new iOS 26 and its eye-catching Liquid Glass design? Here's everything you missed at WWDC 2025.Launch dateUnless there's a massive glitch in the universe, I have it on good authority that we can expect the Apple Watch Series 11 this September, alongside the rumored iPhone 17. Apple has consistently announced a new Apple Watch every year since its 2014 debut. Except for the first-gen model, they all launched at the yearly iPhone event in September.What's less predictable is the release date. Traditionally, the new model goes on sale anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks after the keynote (which is what we expect for 2025), though recent years have seen delays due to production issues. It's also unclear how newly imposed tariffs will affect the new watch's launch and price in 2025.The Apple Watch Series 11 will follow last year's Apple Watch Series 10, which earned a CNET Editor's Choice Award. Apple sells other models too, like the Apple Watch Ultra 2, which came out in 2023 and the Apple Watch SE, which dropped in 2022. While Apple doesn't say anything about future products, we are fortunate that there are numerous rumors for all Apple Watch models. Here's what leakers and Apple analysts say we can expect for the next Apple Watch(es). CNETHow many Apple Watches will we get this year?We're definitely getting a Series 11, and there's a good chance we'll see an updated Ultra and SE model, according to a report from Bloomberg's Apple analyst Mark Gurman. The Apple Watch Ultra and the cheaper SE line haven't exactly followed a predictable upgrade cycle, but last year's absence could prove a strong clue that 2025 could be the year we get all three again. The Series 10 took the spotlight in 2024 as the only smartwatch announced that year. The new Ultra and Series 11 are mostly expected to look the same, while the SE could be getting a refreshed exterior according to Gurman. And the Ultra could get satellite connectivity and 5G RedCap network access that would bring even the most remote adventures \"on the grid\". James Martin/CNETApple Watch designWith last year's redesign still fresh, the Series 11 will likely look similar to the Series 10 and feature the same large edge-to-edge screen (still 42mm and 46mm) that's brighter, lighter and thinner bezels than its predecessors. Any design tweaks would probably be minor and driven by new technology under the hood.According to MacRumors, the Apple Watch might get a more energy-efficient screen, maybe an LTPO display with higher resolution and better brightness, which, on paper, could help improve the battery life. This could be reserved for the higher-end Ultra 3, which will likely otherwise keep its original design. The more adorable SE, however, could see a more extensive design overhaul. It would still have the body of the Series 8 and, according to Gurman, get several upgrades from the Series 10, like an always-on display. Apple Watch processorApple typically bumps up the processor with every new smartwatch, so we should see an Apple S11 chip this time around for at least the Series 11 and Ultra 3. The Ultra 3 is also rumored to get satellite connectivity and 5G support, but according to Gurman, these features likely won't make it to the Series 11. Considering last gens' upgrade cycle, my personal bet would also be on the SE getting a processor bump up to the S9 chip, currently found in the Ultra 2 and the Apple Watch Series 9.  The Series 10 charges faster than earlier Apple Watches, but the battery lasts the same length of time. Celso Bulgatti/CNETApple Watch batteryIf there's one thing on everyone's wishlist, it's better battery life. The Series 10 introduced faster charging -- 0% to 80% in just 30 minutes compared with 90 minutes on previous models -- but there's room for improvement in battery capacity itself.While there aren't any rumors indicating that new Apple Watches will get a longer battery life, I truly hope Apple addresses the battery because its smartwatches are falling behind. Some Android models use dual chipsets to divide tasks and optimize battery life. I'd like to see Apple adopt a similar strategy and finally push battery life to two full days on a single charge for regular models. I hope the Ultra, which currently gets a full 72 hours on a charge, gets the faster charging and pushes its battery life limits to four full days.Apple Watch priceBased on current pricing, the Apple Watch Series 11 could cost $399 for the 42mm aluminum version and $429 for the 46mm version, with upgrades for cover material and LTE connectivity costing extra. That is unless recently enacted tariffs play a part in pricing this year, which remains to be seen. The other question is what the most expensive variant will be -- solid gold, diamond-encrusted Hermès, anyone? Getty Images/Tharon Green/CNETApple Watch health and fitness upgradesThere's been a persistent rumor about blood pressure tracking finally making its way to the Apple Watch, but it's unclear when it will be ready. According to a March report from Gurman, Apple has already been testing the feature in its smartwatch but has run into problems. Other wearables health companies like Omron and Med-Watch have proven it's possible to measure blood pressure from the wrist, but adding this feature would likely require new sensors and a bulkier design. It would also be less precise than dedicated health devices like Omron's and measure baseline metrics like the Galaxy Watch 7 and Ultra (which isn't supported on Samsung watches in the US).Blood pressure and glucose monitoring have also been thrown in the mix, but the latter might not be fully baked for this cycle according to Gurman. Lastly, the blood oxygen (SpO2) feature that debuted on the Series 6 likely won't be making a comeback this year as Apple is still navigating legal issues related to it. LevelHealth and fitness coachingThe Apple Watch could be stepping up its health and fitness game with more-personalized coaching, potentially debuting on the Series 11 and then also rolling out to compatible Apple Watches. According to Gurman, Apple has been working on a major Health app revamp, code-named Project Mulberry, that would bring AI recommendations and actionable health and fitness insights to users. The new \"Health Plus\" app would likely arrive as part of an iOS 19 update, working in tandem with WatchOS 11 to gather and process data. Though it's still unclear which devices would support it, we could get a first look as early as June 2025 at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).Health coaching is something other competitors, like Garmin and Fitbit, offer through their platforms via premium (paid) subscriptions. It's not clear whether Apple would charge extra for these features, or if they'd be baked into the standard Health app at no additional cost.A WatchOS glow-up could be coming to the Series 11Apple may be preparing a visual refresh for WatchOS and tvOS, with UI updates that echo the glassy, transparent design language seen in visionOS. According to Mark Gurman's May 25th Power On newsletter, the company is expected to unveil the updated interface at WWDC on June 9.The redesign, reportedly code-named \"Solarium\" (as in sunlight), is said to feature clear overlays for icons and notifications that mirror that of visionOS. Initial rumors hinted at it coming only to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, but Gurman's latest report says it's now expected to extend across all platforms, including tvOS and WatchOS.While the changes are said to be subtle and won't impact navigation, they could help WatchOS feel more modern, cohesive and premium, especially when paired with iOS updates. Google made a similar move during its Android Show last week, revealing a new aesthetic UI called Material 3 Expressive for Android phones and Android smartwatches with Wear OS 6 that brings a more polished, unified look across the company's platforms.AI upgrades to the watchIn a separate report, Gurman also mentioned that Apple Intelligence features, including the rumored AI coaching, may find their way onto the Apple Watch. While the current Apple Watch lineup doesn't have processors powerful enough to handle AI tasks on-device, the iPhone could help offload some of the processing. The Apple Watch could take some design cues from visionOS on the Apple Vision Pro headset.  Apple/Screenshot by CNETAdditional future Apple Watch surprisesThere's another rumor floating around that the Apple Watch could get a camera -- not for selfies (this isn't 2015, after all) but for AI-based image recognition. With the release of Apple Intelligence, Apple introduced a visual search tool on the iPhone that uses the camera to provide relevant information about objects and places.According to a report by Gurman, Apple is exploring this option, and even if the company decides to move forward with the technology, it likely wouldn't make its way to the Apple Watch until the 2027 models. While it's not expected for this launch, it could hint what kind of AI integration will arrive with WatchOS 12. By contrast, WatchOS 11 lacks any Apple Intelligence features.WatchOS 12 may also give us clues about the direction Apple is taking with Apple Intelligence on the Watch and could hint at new hardware features as well. The new operating system is expected to be unveiled at Apple's annual developers conference, WWDC 2025, which is scheduled for the week of June 5. A foldable Apple Watch concept published in the US Patent Application Publication in March, 2025. United States Patent Application PublicationAn even further fetched clue hints at a foldable Apple Watch with two cameras. A recent Apple patent, first uncovered by Patently Apple, and published by the US Patent and Trademark Office in March, details an Apple Watch design featuring a foldable screen and another with a dual-screen display that either folds or slides out. The additional screens could give the Apple Watch more real estate to expand its functionality and make it less reliant on the iPhone. The same patent also points to the possibility of two cameras on this dual-screened watch for either AI processing or video calls. Apple often files patents well before any related technology appears in an actual product, so even if this concept does live to see the light of day, we're not expecting it to make its public debut anytime soon.",

The new operating system is expected to be unveiled at Apple\u0026#39;s annual developers conference, \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/wwdc-2025-apple-confirms-june-9-date-for-next-major-event/\" target=\"_self\"\u003eWWDC 2025\u003c/a\u003e, which is scheduled for the week of June 5.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/9cf9696349716102791c4de71dbda40e3f09c4a4/hub/2025/04/14/8e48a0c8-9484-495d-a031-38ca7d982147/foldableapplewatch.jpg?auto=webp\u0026amp;width=768\" alt=\"foldableapplewatch\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(max-width: 1023px)\" srcset=\"https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/34cb49ab4da78799f4ab11d478eb6d8b40112828/hub/2025/04/14/8e48a0c8-9484-495d-a031-38ca7d982147/foldableapplewatch.jpg?auto=webp\u0026amp;width=1024\" alt=\"foldableapplewatch\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(max-width: 1440px)\" srcset=\"https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/321087d5d8744bb40754bd9d70c5a9bf34940314/hub/2025/04/14/8e48a0c8-9484-495d-a031-38ca7d982147/foldableapplewatch.jpg?auto=webp\u0026amp;width=1200\" alt=\"foldableapplewatch\"/\u003e \u003cimg src=\"\" alt=\"foldableapplewatch\" height=\"692.5972396486825\" width=\"1200\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eA foldable Apple Watch concept published in the US Patent Application Publication in March, 2025.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003eUnited States Patent Application Publication\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn even further fetched clue hints at a foldable Apple Watch with \u003cem\u003etwo\u003c/em\u003e cameras. A recent Apple patent, first \u003ca href=\"https://www.patentlyapple.com/2025/03/apple-thinks-outside-the-box-and-invents-a-new-apple-watch-design-with-a-foldable-display-and-dual-cameras.html\" target=\"_self\"\u003euncovered by Patently Apple\u003c/a\u003e, and published by the US Patent and Trademark Office in March, details an Apple Watch design featuring a foldable screen and another with a dual-screen display that either folds or slides out. The additional screens could give the Apple Watch more real estate to expand its functionality and make it less reliant on the iPhone. The same patent also points to the possibility of two cameras on this dual-screened watch for either AI processing or video calls. Apple often files patents well before any related technology appears in an actual product, so even if this concept does live to see the light of day, we\u0026#39;re not expecting it to make its public debut anytime soon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/article\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
