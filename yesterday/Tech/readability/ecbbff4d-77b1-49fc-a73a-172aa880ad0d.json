CTC Global’s high-capacity, U.S.-manufactured advanced conductors are a proven technology demonstrated to boost grid capacity and reliability at unparalleled speed.Together, we will identify high-impact transmission lines through a Request for Information (RFI) to states, utilities and transmission developers interested in collaborating on solutions to unlock grid capacity across the country. Selected partners and projects will gain access to a powerful combination of resources to help accelerate deployment, including cost assistance, workforce training and technical analysis.Rapid access to reliable, safe and efficient transmission infrastructure is fundamental to enabling America's energy future. This initiative is designed to accelerate regional economic growth and development, add capacity, improve grid reliability and performance and lower energy costs for all.",
