  "text": "It's a truism at this point to say that Americans own a lot of guns. Case in point: This week, a fire chief in rural Alabama stopped to help a driver who had just hit a deer. The two men walked up the driveway of a nearby home. For reasons that remain unclear, a man came out of the house with a gun and started shooting. This was a bad idea on many levels, but most practically because both the fire chief and the driver were also armed. Between the three of them, everyone got shot, the fire chief died, and the man who lived in the home was charged with murder. But despite the ease of acquiring legal weapons, a robust black market still exists to traffic in things like \"ghost guns\" (no serial numbers) and machine gun converters (which make a semi-automatic weapon into an automatic). According to a major new report released this month by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, there was a 1,600 percent increase in the use of privately made \"ghost guns\" during crimes between 2017 and 2023. Between 2019 and 2023, the seizure of machine gun converters also increased by 784 percent. Ars Technica has covered these issues for years, since both \"ghost guns\" and machine gun converters can be produced using 3D-printed parts, the schematics for which are now widely available online. But you can know about an issue and still be surprised when local prosecutors start talking about black market trafficking rings, inept burglary schemes, murder—and 3D printing operations being run out of a local apartment. Philadelphia story I live in the Philadelphia area, and this is a real Philadelphia story; I know all of the places in it well. Many people in this story live in Philadelphia proper, but the violence (and the 3D printing!) they are accused of took place in the suburbs, in places like Jenkintown, Lower Merion township, and Bucks County. If you know Philly at all, you may know that these are all west and northwest suburban areas and that all of them are fairly comfortable places overall. Indeed, The New York Times ran a long story this month called \"How Sleepy Bucks County Became a Rival to the Hamptons.\" Lower Merion is one of the wealthier Philly suburbs, while Jenkintown is a charming little northwest suburb that was also the setting for the long-running sitcom The Goldbergs. Local county prosecutors are more often busting up shipments of fake Jason Kelce-autographed merch or going after—and later not going after—comedian Bill Cosby. But today, prosecutors in Montgomery County announced something different: they had cracked open a local 3D-printing black market gun ring—and said that one of the group's 3D-printed guns was used last month to murder a man during a botched burglary. Mug shots of Fuentes and Fulforth. Credit: Montco DA's Office It's a pretty bizarre story. As the police tell it, things began with 26-year-old Jeremy Fuentes driving north to a Bucks County address. Fuentes worked for a junk hauling company in nearby Willow Grove, and he had gone to Bucks County to give an estimate for a job. While the homeowner was showing Fuentes around the property, Fuentes allegedly noticed \"a large gun safe, multiple firearms boxes, gun parts and ammunition\" in the home. Outside of work, Fuentes was said to be a member of a local black market gun ring, and so when he saw this much gun gear in one spot—and when he noted that the homeowners were elderly—he saw dollar signs. Police say that after the estimate visit, Fuentes contacted Charles Fulforth, 41, of Jenkintown, who was a key member of the gun ring. Fuentes had an idea: Fulforth should rob the home and steal all the gun-related supplies. Unfortunately, the group was not great at directions. Fuentes didn't provide complete and correct information, so when Fulforth and an accomplice went to rob the home in December 2024, they drove to a Lower Merion home instead. This home was not in Bucks County at all—in fact, it was 30 minutes south—but it had a similar street address to the home Fuentes had visited. When they invaded the Lower Merion home on December 8, the two burglars found not an elderly couple but a 25-year-old man named Andrew Gaudio and his 61-year-old mother, Bernadette. Andrew was killed, while Bernadette was shot but survived. Police arrested Fulforth just three days later, on December 11, and they picked up his fellow burglar on December 17. But the cops didn't immediately realize just what they had stumbled into. Only after they searched Fulforth's Jenkintown apartment and found a 9 mm 3D-printed gun did they realize this might be more than a simple burglary. How had Fulforth acquired the weapon? According to a statement on the case released today by the Montgomery County District Attorney, the investigation involved \"search warrants on multiple locations and forensic searches of mobile phones,\" which revealed that Fulforth had his own \"firearm production facility\"—aka, \"a group of 3D printers.\" Detectives even found a video of a Taurus-style gun part being printed on the devices, and they came to believe that the gun used to kill Andrew Gaudio was \"one of many manufactured by Fulforth.\" In addition to making ghost gun parts at his \"highly sophisticated, clandestine firearms production facility,\" Fulforth was also accused of making machine gun converters with 3D-printed parts. These parts would be preinstalled in the guns that the group was trafficking to raise their value. According to investigators, \"From the review of the captured cellphone communications among the gun trafficking members, the investigation found that when [machine gun conversion] switches were installed on AR pistols, it increased the price of the firearm by at least $1,000.\" Fuentes, who had initially provided the address that led to the murder, was arrested this morning. Authorities have also charged five others with being part of the gun ring. So, a tragic and stupid story, but one that highlights just how mainstream 3D-printing tech has become. No massive production facility or dimly lit warehouse is needed—just put a few printers in a bedroom and you, too, can become a local gun trafficking kingpin. There's nothing novel about any of this, and in fact, fewer people were shot than in that bizarre Alabama gun battle mentioned up top. Still, it hits home when a technology I've both written and read about for years on Ars shows up in your community—and leaves a man dead.",
