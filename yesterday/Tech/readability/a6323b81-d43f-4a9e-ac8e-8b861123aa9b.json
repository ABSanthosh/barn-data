  "text": "Five music guests we think will make an appearance. Kendrick Lamar is back on the biggest stage in sports. The rap icon is set to headline the Super Bowl 59 halftime show as the Kansas City Chiefs face off against the Philadelphia Eagles — round two in a high-stakes rematch just three years in the making. It marks Lamar’s first return to the Super Bowl stage since his 2022 performance alongside Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Mary J. Blige, but this time, he’s running the show solo.Speculation over surprise guests is at a fever pitch. One name is already locked in: longtime collaborator SZA, which is of no surprise since the two announced they'd be going on tour together.This is Kendrick Lamar though so there will be more guests. Here’s who else might be stepping onto that stage with him:Lefty GunplayA Lefty Gunplay cameo wouldn’t be surprising — especially if Kendrick wants to make waves in New Orleans. The L.A. rapper is one of several hometown voices featured on GNX, appearing on the standout single \"TV Off.\" If Kendrick adds it to the setlist, bringing Lefty along feels like a no-brainer.There’s also a real possibility that, much like his The Pop Out event in Inglewood, Kendrick opts for a full-circle moment — bringing the entire GNX roster on stage as a tribute to their shared L.A. roots.Baby KeemFamily ties run deep. Baby Keem, Kendrick’s cousin and frequent collaborator, has been one of rap’s most exciting new voices. “Family Ties” won them a Grammy, and their chemistry on stage is untouchable. Mashable Top Stories A Keem appearance would be high-energy, high-impact, and totally expected.Future \u0026 Metro BoominThe enemy of my enemy is my halftime guest? Metro and Future have both had their issues with Drake, and with Not Like Us sweeping the Grammys, there’s no better time for some strategic alliances. Metro’s production shaped an era, and Future’s hypnotic flow could turn this into a full-circle moment. If they pop out for “Like That” or “Mask Off,” the subs will be loud, the crowd will be louder, and the internet might not survive.Pusha TContinuing the trend of \"dudes who have beef with Drake\" bringing out Pusha T could be seen as the ultimate power move. Pusha T already ended one chapter of Drake’s saga with \"The Story of Adidon\" and with \"Not Like Us\" solidifying Lamar as hip-hop’s reigning diss champion, this would be the exclamation point.Lil WayneA rap elder statesman and a generational icon — Lil Wayne remains one of the best to ever do it. His respect for Kendrick has always been mutual, but their relationship feels oddly strained at the moment. A surprise halftime cameo could serve as an olive branch.Wayne hasn’t been shy about his frustration over being snubbed for the Super Bowl in his own hometown, claiming the NFL “ripped” the show away from him. Whether or not he still holds the weight to headline is another debate entirely, but the sting is real.
