  "description": "The Switch 2's Joy-Con \"mouse\" has some competition. At least one launch game for Nintendo's new console includes USB mouse support. Nobunga's Ambition: Awakening CE lets you plug in a traditional pointing device and get down to business. According to developer Koei Tecmo, the mouse will \"work seamlessly.\" Nobunga's Ambition will let you switch between controller and USB mouse on the fly. \"Once you connect the USB mouse, a message will appear in the top left indicating that the mouse is connected,\" Michi Ryu said in a video (translated from Japanese). \"When the USB mouse is connected, it takes priority over the Joy-Con 2. As you can see, you can switch instantly. It's very smooth.\" So, what does that mean for other mouse-friendly Switch 2 games? Civilization VII, another launch title, comes to mind. We emailed 2K Games to ask and will update this story if we hear back. To be fair, the Switch 2's Joy-Con mouse support is solid. Engadget's Sam Rutherford was pleasantly surprised with it in his hands-on. Still, it's nice to have options. (And let's be honest, a real mouse will be hard to beat.) Although it wasn't a well-known fact, the original Switch also supported USB mice. For example, Nintendo's visual programming tool Game Builder Garage worked with them. But the number of games supporting the Joy-Con mouse makes it a bigger deal on the Switch 2.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-will-support-regular-usb-mice-in-at-least-one-game-205725720.html?src=rss",
