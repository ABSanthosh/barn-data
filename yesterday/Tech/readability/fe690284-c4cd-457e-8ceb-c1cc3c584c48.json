  "text": "The more than two decades since Half-Life 2's release have been filled with plenty of rumors and hints about Half-Life 3, ranging from the official-ish to the thin to the downright misleading. As we head into 2025, though, we're approaching something close to a critical mass of rumors and leaks suggesting that Half-Life 3 is really in the works this time, and could be officially announced in the coming months. The latest tease came just before the end of 2024 via a New Year's Eve social media video from G-Man voice actor Mike Shapiro. In the voice of the mysterious in-game bureaucrat, Shapiro expresses hopes that \"the next quarter century [will] deliver as many unexpected surprises as did the millennium's first (emphasis added)... See you in the new year.\" #Valve #Halflife #GMan #2025 pic.twitter.com/mdT5hlxKJT — Mike Shapiro (@mikeshapiroland) December 31, 2024 The post is all the more notable because it's Shapiro's first in over four years, when he concluded a flurry of promotional posts surrounding the release of Half-Life: Alyx (many of which were in-character as G-Man). And in 2020, just after Alyx's release, Shapiro told USGamer that he had recently worked on a \"blast from the past\" project that he would \"announce... on my Twitter feed when I'm allowed to\" (no such announcement has been forthcoming for any other game). \"I was working on that game for quite a while before I knew [what it was],\" Shapiro said at the time of the unannounced project. \"There was a rehearsal and some recordings, and after one of the recording sessions I was having a drink with the director. He told me what the game was, and nobody knows that this is coming. \"This is going to be such a mindblowing re-up from what people have come to know,\" Shapiro continued in 2020. \"It's going to really... it's going to make people have a complete re-understanding of what they thought they knew about the story in the game prior to it, and I don't even know if people are expecting it.\" Raised HLX-pectations On its own, a single in-character post from a voice actor would probably be a bit too cryptic to excite Half-Life fans who have seen their sequel hopes dashed so often over the last two decades. But the unexpected tease comes amid a wave of leaks and rumors surrounding \"HLX,\" an internal Valve project that has been referenced in a number of other Source 2 engine game files recently.",
