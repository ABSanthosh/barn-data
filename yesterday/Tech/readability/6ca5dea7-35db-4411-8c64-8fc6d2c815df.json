  "text": "With AI Overviews in Search, it’s easier than ever for people to find the information they need and discover relevant sites across the web, which opens up more opportunities to connect with publishers, businesses and creators.Since launching in May and expanding beyond the U.S. in August, the feedback we’ve received for AI Overviews has been highly positive. People prefer using Search with AI Overviews, and they find their search results more helpful.So now, in our largest expansion yet, we’re launching AI Overviews in more than 100 countries and making them accessible in more languages — helping you search in a whole new way, no matter what questions are on your mind.Expanding AI Overviews to more than 100 countriesStarting this week, AI Overviews will begin rolling out in more than 100 countries and territories around the world. With this latest expansion, AI Overviews will have more than 1 billion global users every month. Video format not supported As part of this update, we’re also extending language support across the board. If you’re in any country with AI Overviews, you can now get them in any of the currently supported languages, including English, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish. So, for example, if you’re in the United States and you speak Spanish, you can now see AI Overviews in your preferred language.Connecting to the best of the webHelping people discover content from publishers, businesses and creators remains central to our approach with AI Overviews in Search. Since May, we’ve introduced more prominent ways to show links to relevant websites within AI Overviews, with a right-hand link display on desktop and a similar experience on mobile, accessible by tapping the site icons in the upper right. And earlier this month, we launched in-line links that appear directly within the text of AI Overviews. In our testing, these updates drove an increase in traffic to supporting websites compared to the previous designs.As always, ads will continue to appear in dedicated slots throughout the page, with clear labeling to distinguish between organic and sponsored results. And as we shared earlier this month, ads in AI Overviews are now available on relevant queries for mobile users in the U.S., so we can better connect people with the products and brands that are helpful to their searches.AI Overviews are just one of the ways that we’re expanding the kinds of questions you can ask on Google and making it easier to explore content online.
