The rapid advancement of AI is creating a sense of urgency and opportunity to meet evolving customer expectations and to help address issues like rising costs and supply chain complexities. At NRF 2025, Retail’s Big Show, Google Cloud is showing how AI agents and AI-powered search are helping retailers operate more efficiently and create more personalized shopping experiences to meet the demands of the AI era.Introducing critical generative AI tools for retailersOne of the most transformative tools for retailers is Google Agentspace, a platform that helps companies easily build intelligent agents. AI agents are software systems that use AI to pursue goals and complete tasks on behalf of users. They show reasoning, planning and memory and have a level of autonomy to make decisions, learn and adapt. Retailers can now use AI agents to personalize the customer experience by offering tailored product recommendations, answering questions in real-time and guiding shoppers through the buying process. AI agents can also streamline operations by automating tasks like inventory management, customer service and even loss prevention, allowing employees to focus on higher-value work.In addition to Agentspace, ahead of NRF, Google Cloud also shared enhancements to Vertex AI Search for commerce, which now uses advanced language models to improve product discovery. And Google Cloud also demonstrated how its Connected Stores solution connects shoppers' devices and in-store systems to enhance the omnichannel experience. These developments, coupled with Google Cloud's advancements in image-to-video and image generation, provide retailers with powerful tools to improve business operations and deliver exceptional customer experiences. Here are only a few examples of how retailers are using Google Cloud’s AI technology.Wayfair: Reimagining ecommerceWayfair, a leader in online home goods and furniture, shared that it’s using Gemini on Vertex AI to significantly improve its product catalog and boost employee productivity. This work has helped them speed up product launches five-fold by automating tasks like product tagging and categorization. This not only saves them hundreds of thousands of dollars annually, but also ensures a smoother, more accurate experience for customers. Gemini even helps Wayfair catch errors in product information and create a safer online environment by identifying and flagging inappropriate content. Beyond the customer experience, Wayfair is also using Gemini on Google Workspace to empower their employees and foster a more collaborative and productive work environment.NVIDIA: Powering AI from the cloud to the storeOur partnership with NVIDIA is all about helping retailers get the tools and infrastructure they need to use AI effectively and at scale. Now with NVIDIA's AI Enterprise software available on Google Cloud, retailers can handle more data and more complex AI tasks without their systems getting bogged down.Companies like LiveX AI and Standard.ai are already benefiting from this partnership. LiveX AI is building AI agents that reduce customer support costs while providing a more personalized experience. And Standard.ai is helping brick-and-mortar stores understand customer behavior and improve the in-store experience.Everseen: Bringing computer vision to retailEverseen announced it’s working with Google Cloud to bring computer vision to brick-and-mortar retail stores. By using Everseen's Vision AI platform with Google Distributed Cloud and Vertex AI, retailers can process vast amounts of visual data directly in stores, providing instant alerts and real-time insights. Imagine AI-powered systems that can automatically detect and prevent theft, optimize inventory management and even enhance the customer experience.Partnerships that drive innovationCollaboration is key to making the most of AI in retail, and Google Cloud’s partners announced several new tools at NRF to help retailers see results from their AI investments. Shopify, Revionics, LiveRamp, Revieve and Eagle Eye are helping retailers transform marketing with AI-powered technologies that personalize campaigns, improve customer insights and make the most of ad spending. Bloomreach, BigCommerce and Quantum Metric are also helping retailers create seamless shopping experiences across all channels.To help retailers operate more sustainably, Manhattan Associates, O9 Solutions, Impact Analytics and 345 Global are using AI to optimize logistics, reduce waste and minimize environmental impact. And finally, companies like Vusion Group, NCR Voyix and Zebra are bringing AI to the retail floor to improve operations, personalize shopping and enhance the customer experience.Join Google Cloud at NRF booth #5507 to see all of these exciting new technologies in action. You can also read more about the new AI tools for retail and other news in Google Cloud’s Press Corner, including new products for retailers and partnerships with companies that are helping retailers take advantage of this new technology.",
