We’re partnering with Varaha and Charm to purchase 100,000 tons of biochar carbon removal from each company by 2030. These are the largest biochar carbon removal deals to date.These deals will enable 200,000 tons of carbon removal to help Google achieve our net zero emissions goal — and help catalyze biochar production toward a scale that can help the planet mitigate climate change.With these partnerships with Varaha and Charm, we’re adding biochar to a growing toolkit of carbon removal solutions Google supports (such as enhanced rock weathering and direct air capture), and as a complement to our ongoing efforts to kickstart the carbon removal field through Frontier and Symbiosis.",
