  "text": "Apple is making progress on a standard for brain implant devices that can help people with disabilities control devices such as iPhones with their thoughts. As reported in The Wall Street Journal, Apple has plans to release that standard to other developers later this year.The company has partnered with Synchron, which has been working with other companies, including Amazon, on ways to make devices more accessible. Synchron makes an implant called a Stentrode that is implanted in a vein on the brain's motor cortex. Once implanted, the Stentrode can read brain signals and translate that to movement on devices including iPhones, iPads and Apple's Vision Pro VR headset.As we saw last year, a patient with ALS testing the Synchron technology was able to navigate menus in the Vision Pro device and use it to experience the Swiss Alps in VR. The technology could become more widely available to people with paralysis. The company has a community portal for those interested in learning about future tests.

Real-world feedback and testing can uncover critical usability issues that internal teams and automated tools will miss,\" he said.Other Apple announcementsSeparately, Apple announced a set of new accessibility features it plans to roll out later this year. They include:Accessibility Nutrition Labels in the App Store will show accessibility features in games and other apps.A Magnifier tool for Mac, similar to the one available in iOS.Braille Access through compatible braille devices allowing for note taking, access to more books and live captions for braille displays.An Accessibility Reader mode across iOS, Mac and Vision Pro.Live Captions for Apple Watch.Enhanced View on Vision Pro.Other features and updates are listed on its blog.Global Accessibility Awareness Day is on May 15.",
