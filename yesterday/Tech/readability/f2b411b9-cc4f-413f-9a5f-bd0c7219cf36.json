That would line up with some of the rumors, and super-thin foldables has certainly been a trend so far this year. I’ve wedged plenty of chunky foldables into the side pocket of my yoga pants, so I for one would welcome this development.Per usual, Samsung is offering a little incentive to reserve a device for pre-order ahead of the big reveal: $50 in credit to use at Samsung.com. That’ll cover a chunk of the cost of a case for a foldable phone, which run between $85 and $100 for the Galaxy Z Fold 6 on Samsung’s website right now. If the Ultra comes with an Ultra price tag, it might be worth shelling out a little more to protect it from the wear and tear of daily use. Just a little free advice.",
