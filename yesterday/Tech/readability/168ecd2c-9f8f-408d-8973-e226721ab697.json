Western recently likened the tech to a sourdough starter — a small but potent base for growing something much bigger. “Our satellites utilise the zero-gravity, ultra-cold, vacuum environment of space to produce tiny crystals of a higher quality than could ever be made otherwise,” he told TNW in April. Once returned to Earth, the crystal “seeds” can be used to grow larger crystals that form the basis of ultra-efficient computer chips, which could power everything from data centres to telecoms networks.  Space Forge claims these semiconductors could halve the time it takes to charge an EV. The technology could also be used to make new metal alloys or pharmaceutical drugs. At least, that’s the idea. Space Forge hasn’t yet produced any materials in space and has been patiently building ForgeStar-1 for the past four years to validate the technology.  The company faced a setback in 2023 when its first satellite was lost after Virgin Orbit’s satellite launcher experienced an anomaly and failed to reach orbit, destroying the payload.   Now that its first satellite is in orbit, the company hopes to produce its first-ever materials in space. However, the ForgeStar-1 satellite will be deliberately burned up in Earth’s atmosphere after completing its experiments, as the company has not yet secured the necessary certification to bring it back to Earth, Western said. Still, the company noted that the burn-up will demonstrate that even if the re-entry system were to fail, the satellite would completely disintegrate. The mission will also deliver critical test data, telemetry, and validation needed to support future in-space manufacturing missions. Space Forge’s next satellite, ForgeStar-2, is designed to manufacture materials in space and return them safely to Earth. The startup recently secured $30mn in a funding round led by the NATO Innovation Fund to accelerate its development.",
