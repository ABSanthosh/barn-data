  "text": "In a Q\u0026A at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference, Disney CFO Hugh Johnston participated in an audience discussion about the Walt Disney Company’s plans for the future in its various divisions across entertainment. Talk soon turned to how Disney Experiences is gearing up for the opening of Walt Disney World competitor Epic Universe at Universal Studios Orlando. According to a report from Blog Mickey, the discussion provided new insight on how Disney Experiences, the Walt Disney Company’s theme park and cruise brand, is planning on tackling lower demand as price increases hit at both the Disneyland and Walt Disney World resorts. Johnston admitted that declined attendance in the summer of 2024 was a “hiccup” but that things are “doing fine” with consumers since. That remains to be seen as just a couple weeks ago, those price hikes hit as the parks’ most in-demand season—the holidays—began. At least Southern California residents can partake in a ticket bundle deal right now at the Disneyland Resort as the new year starts. The “Get a 3-Day Ticket for $67 Per Day” promotion is available for purchase now; it allows three visits between January 1 and May 15, 2025. In regards to Disney’s official stance on whether it’s feeling worried about the highly anticipated Epic Universe opening—an event that could potentially affect attendance at Walt Disney World in Orlando—Johnston affirmed even before the question came up that Disney’s parks division is an “asset of one.” For the most part, when it comes to IPs (wink at Marvel) they don’t necessarily compete; Disney is working on incorporating experiences and attractions based on recent hit films such as Encanto in next year’s new parade, and a 3D Zootopia show by the end of next year. When asked head-on, Johnston shared that overall regard toward Epic Universe is more of a welcoming feeling. Universal’s theme park is set to open with lands inspired by Harry Potter, How to Train Your Dragon (in time for the live-action film), Nintendo, and the Universal Monsters’ Dark Universe—though the company’s biggest IP at the moment is Wicked (which currently is without plans to be featured at the parks despite demand). Johnston shared that there’s a sense of “rising tide lifts all boats,” positing that folks having more reason to go to Orlando could allow for more visits to encompass both resorts. However he also added that despite more summer bookings at Walt Disney World, the company is still “cautious and conservative” about the upcoming year and have allotted “some negative” into the books.
