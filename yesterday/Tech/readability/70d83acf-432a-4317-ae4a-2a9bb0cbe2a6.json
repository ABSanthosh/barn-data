If you buy something through links on our site, Mashable may earn an affiliate commission. Greek mythology and the WWE collide in the trailer for Dimension 20: Titan Takedown. Headed up by Game Master Brennan Lee Mulligan, the four-episode actual play campaign transports viewers to ancient Athens, where gods and heroes take part in the Titan Takedown, which Mulligan dubs \"the battle of the millennium.\"And who more fitting to play out this story than four WWE Superstars? The trailer introduces Titan Takedown's cast of righteous wrestlers with panache, starting out with Xavier Woods as Julius Mortem. Next up is Bayley, whose minotaur Thea Kittleroo is a barbarian through and through. Joining them is Kofi Kingston, playing King Adonis Thanaformus. \"Spoiler alert, he's a king!\" Kingston informs his fellow players.Rounding out the cast is Chelsea Green as tabaxi rogue Tabatha, or Tabby for short. She may or may not be singing the Pussycat Dolls' \"Buttons\" as she sneaks around, so brace yourself for cat puns galore.The rest of the trailer for Titan Takedown teases a mini wrestling ring set, serious drama between the Greek gods, and Mulligan going full WWE announcer mode, complete with a sparkly jacket and drop-down announcer mic. Witness the righteous wrestlers in all their glory in the trailer above.Dimension 20: Titan Takedown premieres April 2 on Dropout. Belen Edwards is an Entertainment Reporter at Mashable.
