  "text": "Muppet*Vision 3D, Jim Henson's final project, is making way for Pixar's new Monsters Inc. land. As we learned late last week, the beloved Muppet*Vision 3D attraction at Walt Disney World has been confirmed to be a part of the closures to make way for Pixar’s Monsters Inc. land slated for the Disney Parks’ super-charged expansion in the works. Then, over the weekend, it was officially announced that Muppets Courtyard, the home of the Muppet*Vision 3D, will be demolished without any third-act efforts from the Muppets to save their theater—though Henson nerds have expressed how much like a Muppet movie it would be to make a last stand. But as things are often subject to big changes at Walt Disney World, it’s the end of an era for the cherished cinematic 3D chaos of Muppet*Vision.  What makes it all the more bittersweet is that it was the last Muppets project to be helmed by their creator Jim Henson. It features timeless animatronic work (Statler and Waldorf heckling along on the balcony, a walk-around Sweetums) as part of the show. In a statement on Instagram, the Jim Henson company shared the following: “Jim Henson’s final project was Muppet*Vision 3D, now regarded as a true theme park classic. Innovation was always Jim Henson’s north star, and his trailblazing career led him to a unique challenge: a truly immersive Muppet experience where audiences are part of the happy chaos of the iconic Muppet Show. Originally debuting in 1991, Muppet*Vision 3D combined 3D technology with real-world practical effects, alongside animatronic and live Muppet characters. The result was a one-of-a-kind Jim Henson experience, and an unforgettable capstone to Jim’s magnificent career. As we learn of the show’s upcoming closure in its current form at Disney’s Hollywood Studios, we look forward to Muppet*Vision 3D’s next act.” Image: Sabina Graves, io9/Gizmodo Muppets Courtyard featured the whimsy and wonder of walking around the set of a Muppet production backlot, with statues of Miss Piggy abounding—like the Ms. Liberty fountain, which we hope just gets re-homed at the Muppets’ new place of residence (more on that below). At least we won’t miss the truly atrocious (yet somehow cult-beloved) slice house PizzeRizzo. While the Monsters Inc. Monstropolis will take up the space as it’s currently occupied, the Muppets won’t be going far at least. In fact, they will play the starring role in the re-imagining of the Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster (currently headlined by Aerosmith) at Hollywood Studios. This news came along with the announcement of Muppet*Vision 3D‘s closure. It’s a little concerning, given that pairing the iconic family franchise with one of the park’s most hardcore coasters could alienate introducing the Muppets to children; that was easier when it was baked into Muppet*Vision as a gateway to get them interested in The Muppet Show and spin-off movies on Disney+. Here’s hoping that perhaps Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster gets new ride track akin to the interactive level of Epcot’s Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind but maybe just a tad bit more family friendly—and that could indeed be what Disney Imagineering has in mind, and not just giving it a new coat of paint. Let’s see them go all in Muppet-ifying it with a lot of Electric Mayhem. Image: Disney Experiences Want more io9 news?
