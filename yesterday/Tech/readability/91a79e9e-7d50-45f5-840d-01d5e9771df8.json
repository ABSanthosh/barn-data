  "text": "Dec 06, 2024 [[read-time]] min read The traditional gift for an AI model is a quiz, right? No? Well what about for a Geminiversary? Happy birthday, Gemini! A year ago, we introduced Gemini 1.0 — and we’ve been pretty busy since. Over the past year, we’ve expanded the Gemini family of models, found creative ways to integrate Gemini capabilities into the products you love and enabled developers and organizations all over the world to use Gemini to build products, work smarter and grow their businesses.To celebrate, we wanted to take a look back at just a few milestones from the Gemini journey so far. But instead of just telling you what we’ve been up to, we thought it would be more fun to test your knowledge with a quiz.So, how much do you remember from the first year of our Gemini era? What was an early placeholder title for Gemini when it was still in its project phase? Titan is right! Titan is also the name of Saturn's largest moon — so we did stick with something of a star-studded theme. Actually, the answer is Titan, which is also the name of Saturn’s largest moon. While we stayed in the stars, we pivoted to Gemini. Titan is right! Titan is also the name of Saturn's largest moon — so we did stick with something of a star-studded theme.

Actually, the answer is Titan, which is also the name of Saturn’s largest moon. While we stayed in the stars, we pivoted to Gemini. Since launch, we’ve advanced the model’s capabilities — launching a new generation with Gemini 1.5, which had a breakthrough in long context understanding, referring to the amount of information the model can process. At ____tokens, we offer the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model to date, which powers developer use cases that no other model can handle. Two million is correct! Context windows are important because they help AI models recall information during a session — just wanted to give you some added, ahem, context. Not quite — the answer is 2 million!

Which Gemini model is known for its on-device capabilities? There’s no “yes” in Nano, but yes, that's the right answer! Gemini Nano is our smaller, more efficient model that powers Android features like Smart Reply, Summarize and more — and can even work without an internet connection. Sorry, but no — as in (Na)no.

What is the word that means Gemini can reason and process data from text, images, videos, code and more? Multiple rounds of applause! You got it right, the answer is multimodal. No, sorry — multiple choice is hard, but not for Gemini. The correct answer is multimodal. Multiple rounds of applause! You got it right, the answer is multimodal.

No, sorry — multiple choice is hard, but not for Gemini. The correct answer is multimodal. There are various models of Gemini — of these models, which would you use to summarize a short movie? You’re a Gemini pro! The right answer is Gemini 1.5 Pro. Last May, we announced that 1.5 Pro has a context window of 2 million tokens, which means it can recall more information and summarize larger amounts of data — like that short movie we mentioned. If this question felt a little tricky, it might be because we announced this 2 million token context window at the same time we introduced Gemini 1.5 Flash — which, true to its name, is optimized for speed and efficiency.

At I/O 2024, Sundar talked about Gemini's future abilities to \"think\" multiple steps ahead and work across different environments — like the web, virtual worlds and the real world — to get things done for you. How did he refer to this? Yes! The correct answer is “as an AI agent.” “I think about them as intelligent systems that show reasoning, planning and memory,” Sundar said at I/O. Maybe these agents will come out from under cover soon… The correct answer is “as an AI agent.” “I think about them as intelligent systems that show reasoning, planning and memory,” Sundar said at I/O.

When we announced Gemini in December 2023, we also unveiled what is used both to train Gemini models and serve products that run it. What was it? You got it! Technically, today isn’t just Gemini’s one-year anniversary: On December 6, 2023 we also made Cloud TPU v5p available, which at the time was our most powerful, scalable and flexible AI accelerator (since then we’ve launched the next-generation TPU, Trillium). In case you were wondering, TPUs are custom-designed chips that specialize in AI computing tasks.

In July, we released Gemma 2, a more efficient and higher-performing version. Over the year, what other models did we add to the Gemma family? The correct answer is all of them. CodeGemma specializes in code completion and code generation tasks; RecurrentGemma is well-suited for text generation tasks and requires less memory and can generate long sequences faster than Gemma. And PaliGemma is a vision-language model, so it can do things like image and short video caption generation, visual question answering and object detection. Just yesterday, we also released PaliGemma 2! The correct answer is all of them.
