  "text": "Disney goths unite! The world of Twisted Wonderland is finally set to arrive stateside as an anime this October just in time for spooky season in this halfway to Halloween trailer announcement. The Disney+ series will adapt the Book of Heartslabyul arc fans might be familiar with as it centers Yuuken, the main character of the franchise’s previous iterations through the popular Disney game and manga series, who is invited to join Night Raven College by a mysterious masked figure. The school of Dark Magic has seven houses, one for each of the Disney Villains featured including: Maleficent, Hades, Scar, The Evil Queen, The Queen of Hearts, Jafar and Ursula. We’d like to join the Hades house, please because that’s definitely a premise we can get behind. Watch the trailer below which features the game’s theme song. The trailer from Disney+ showcases studios Yumeta Company and Graphinica’s anime, showrun by chief director Takahiro Natori (Tokyo Mew Mew New) and directed by Shin Katagai (The Ossan Newbie Adventurer, Became Invincible) as reported by Crunchyroll. The previously announced news also named Yoichi Kato (City Hunters: Shinjuku Private Eyes) as the series writer with animation art by Haruka Nakano and Akane Sato, based on the franchise’s original aesthetic and animation by Yana Toboso. It has been greenlit for three seasons on the platform.  © Disney+ After some quick research into the Cheshire-smiling demon cat named Grim, there’s no need to say more: I am so in. I’d seen some pieces of the manga art and game materials before, but now with the official series premiering with such a darkly fun concept surrounding villainous teens and iconic Disney baddies, I’m very excited to see more. The looks are Disney bound gothic goals, and the concept is going to add to more fun for the spooky niche of Disney fans ready to embrace the Dark Academia aesthetic. Twisted Wonderland drops on Disney+ this October. Want more io9 news?
