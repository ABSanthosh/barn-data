Credit: it made me add this again instead of suggesting a url January is one of my favorite times of year as a spin teacher because I see so many new faces in my classes, and I love helping people set up their bikes, develop a routine, and make the most of their new membership. Even though you go to the gym to use equipment you don't have at home, part of maximizing the benefits does include bringing some personal items along with you, so I always make sure to offer recommendations for what the ideal gym bag should look like, too. Whether you're a complete newbie, a seasoned gym rat, a solo trainer, a group fitness enthusiast, or some combination of those, here's what you should pack, according to instructors and pros.First: The gym bag itselfI want to start by talking about your gym bag. There are a lot of benefits to having a designated gym bag. First, it's a motivational push. I'm the kind of person who sets an outfit out before bed every night to make the next morning smoother. Doing that relieves a bunch of stress because I'm not tired and rushed, fumbling through my closet to find something presentable. I feel the same way about setting out my gym bag. When I see it packed and ready to go by the door, I know a big chunk of work is already taken care of so I should just follow through and head out to the gym. \"I like having a backpack ready with my shoes and gym essentials so I don’t have to think of what to pack before a gym session,\" says Christina Phipps, a certified group fitness instructor in Bismarck, N.D. \"Same thing for early morning workouts: I prep the night before to make the mornings easier.\" Madison Bailey, a NASM-certified personal trainer in New York City, says one of the most important things you can \"bring\" to the gym—especially if you're new to working out in public—is some confidence. Even though I have been going to the gym as a member for all of my adult life and as an instructor for the past four years, I still occasionally need to hype myself up. It's intimidating to see someone you perceive as farther along in their fitness journey than you are or approach an unfamiliar machine for the first time, so whatever you can do to get some confidence and fake it 'til you make it is key. For me, that involves looking and feeling my best, so I use a bag I consider extra cute and actually enjoy bringing with me: A fleece belt bag from Lululemon (currently on sale for $39). That's not very big, I know, so if you're looking for something that can hold all your equipment, accessories, and even clothes and shoes, try the all-time favorite of Lifehacker Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, the Adidas Defender. Spacious and durable, this thing will hold it all, so you'll feel prepared the second you enter the gym. Drinks are next on your gym listEven if you've never gone to the gym a single time in your life (yet!), you know hydration is a key part of any workout, but if you need to hear it from an expert, here's what Teddy Savage, National Lead Trainer at Planet Fitness, has to say: \"Hydration is the single most important thing you should think about before, during, and after your workout. Your muscles, heart, and mind need that cool refreshing H20 to stay at peak performance and help prevent you from getting sluggish when you need that energy.\"Obviously, you need a water bottle and I'm just going to go ahead and tell you right now that my gold-standard pick is the Owala FreeSip. In the same way I use my little Lululemon pouch for a boost of cuteness that makes me want to take it to the gym, Savage suggests choosing a bottle that is \"a bold and colorful representation of you,\" one that makes you want to carry it proudly. The FreeSip comes in a variety of colors, so no problem there. I am obsessed with mine at all times of the day, but especially at the gym, where the 24-ounce version fits in the cupholder of every machine, keeps my drinks super cold, and comes in handy with its dual spout, which can function as a standard sipper or by using the attached straw. It opens with the push of a button, so I don't have to fiddle with fidgety screw tops and can easily get some water down between shouted cues for my classes. If you're cruising on a cardio machine, you don't want to waste time or compromise your safety by fumbling with a bottle. Feel free to put a protein shake or some pre-workout powder in there, too, though it'll take you some time to figure out the exact ones you like and want to pack. Bailey says that in some fitness spaces, you may hear chatter about the value of fasting before a workout, but you can ignore that if you're a beginner and focus on eating before the gym and making sure you have plenty of water and electrolytes on hand during your session. Phipps and I are on the same wavelength when it comes to the importance of an oft-overlooked beverage to pack in addition to your water bottle: the humble treat. If you see me in the gym early in the morning, you see a Dunkin' Donuts iced coffee next to me. In the evening, you'll catch me with an overpriced, decadent smoothie. Spin class attendees occasionally ask me why I'm dual-wielding beverages—especially when one of them has, God forbid, some sugar—and I'll tell you the same thing I tell them: Because it's OK to enjoy yourself at the gym. In fact, it's imperative. Rewarding yourself for hard work is a huge motivator, especially if you're doing it while you do the hard work. If you start to look at the gym as something you must do without enjoyment and tasty treats as something you can't have on your wellness journey, you won't keep going, no matter how well you pack your bag. What gym pros recommend you pack in your bagOther than that, what you pack has a lot to do with what your goals are. Bailey advises you should never forget your headphones, which is definitely true: A good playlist can get you through anything, which is why I keep an old pair of earbuds in my bag at all times.What else I bring depends on my game plan for the day. I almost always have some one-pound ankle or wrist weights in my bag to increase the intensity of whatever I get up to in the cardio room. I also pack my own cable machine attachments, which might seem finicky, but gives me a little peace of mind that I'm not strapping someone else's sweat directly onto my body. On leg day, this means I bring my own ankle straps for kickbacks, while days set aside for arms or back muscles call for little handles. Another thing I like about bringing my own attachments is that they're always the same, so I never have to adjust to a new one and change my routine. I've also heard stories from friends whose gyms make them rent cable machine attachments or who workout in spaces where the attachments routinely go missing, leaving the machine unusable for everybody. You don't have to buy a whole set of attachments—although you can for as low as about $40—but having a few of your own for under $20 solves a lot of problems in one go.\"Something that I find to be helpful with people is lifting straps,\" adds Bailey, who has been training people one-on-one for four years. \"I prefer figure eight straps, but that’s just me. You can’t just drop weight with them, though; you have to control the weight all the way to the ground. I like them because most people are stronger than their grip allows them to realize.\" In that same vein, don't forget a stretching band, Phipps says. You can use a resistance band for stretching, then keep using it throughout your workout as designed. Sure, your gym likely has these—but I've been to plenty of places where they're in high demand and almost impossible to access during peak hours. It's small and folds up into your bag, so again, just consider bringing your own. (I also use mine for hip thrusts, placing it over my hips and hanging two dumbbells from the side. It works just as well as putting a full bar over your hips and cuts down the time you may spend waiting for someone else to finish with the bigger bar.) Also toss a multi-device charger into your bag. We've already been over how important it is to remember your headphones, but it's just as important to keep them charged so they work when you need them, and the same goes for your phone, which plays your music, and your fitness tracker. When I work out without my Apple Watch on, I get really annoyed with myself. As Savage says, \"In your mind, it’s almost as if none of that sweat-inducing work even happened,\" and even though that's not really true, it's still annoying and a setback in its own way, especially if you're committed to tracking your progress. I keep a three-in-one charger for my AirPods, Apple Watch, and iPhone with me. It's better to charge for a few minutes in the locker room and start late than to be without the tech you need to enhance your workout.Finally, Phipps says you should pack your own sweat towel, and I agree. My secret is that I use a Makeup Eraser, which is super soft so it isn't abrasive, sucks up all moisture immediately, and costs about $14, so it's comparable to any of the gym-specific towels on the market. It also folds up teeny-tiny into my bag or the cupholder of a cardio machine, which I appreciate. Lindsey Ellefson Features Editor Lindsey Ellefson is Lifehacker’s Features Editor.

You can \u003ca href=\"https://zdcs.link/aAbXmo?pageview_type=Standard\u0026amp;template=Roundups\u0026amp;module=content-body\u0026amp;element=offer\u0026amp;item=text-link\u0026amp;element_label=use%20a%20resistance%20band\u0026amp;short_url=aAbXmo\u0026amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fwhat-to-bring-to-the-gym\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003euse a resistance band\u003c/a\u003e for stretching, then keep using it throughout your workout as designed. Sure, your gym likely has these—but I\u0026#39;ve been to plenty of places where they\u0026#39;re in high demand and almost impossible to access during peak hours. It\u0026#39;s small and folds up into your bag, so again, just consider bringing your own. (I also use mine for hip thrusts, placing it over my hips and hanging two dumbbells from the side. It works just as well as putting a full bar over your hips and cuts down the time you may spend waiting for someone else to finish with the bigger bar.) \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso toss a multi-device charger into your bag. We\u0026#39;ve already been over how important it is to remember your headphones, but it\u0026#39;s just as important to keep them charged so they work when you need them, and the same goes for your phone, which plays your music, and your fitness tracker. When I work out without my Apple Watch on, I get really annoyed with myself. As Savage says, \u0026#34;In your mind, it’s almost as if none of that sweat-inducing work even happened,\u0026#34; and even though that\u0026#39;s not really \u003cem\u003etrue\u003c/em\u003e, it\u0026#39;s still annoying and a setback in its own way, especially if you\u0026#39;re committed to \u003ca href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/what-i-learned-health-data-tracking\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etracking your progress\u003c/a\u003e.
