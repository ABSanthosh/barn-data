  "description": "Earlier today, third-party app store AltStore PAL, announced that a porn app called Hot Tub was now available to iOS users in the European Union. The marketplace, which enables people in the EU to sideload apps outside of Apple’s App Store, described it as the “first Apple-approved porn app.” Now, Apple says it’s “deeply concerned” about Hot Tub, which as TechCrunch noted, is the first time a porn app has been available natively for the iPhone. “We are deeply concerned about the safety risks that hardcore porn apps of this type create for EU users, especially kids,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement. “This app and others like it will undermine consumer trust and confidence in our ecosystem that we have worked for more than a decade to make the best in the world. Contrary to the false statements made by the marketplace developer, we certainly do not approve of this app and would never offer it in our App Store.” As Apple has pointed out, its notarization guidelines state that app makers shouldn’t “suggest or imply that Apple is a source or supplier of the App, or that Apple endorses any particular representation regarding quality or functionality.” AltStore’s statements would seem to go against that guidance.

Apple has made little secret of its frustration with the DMA, which requires it to allow third-party app stores in Europe. “The truth is that we are required by the European Commission to allow it to be distributed by marketplace operators like AltStore and Epic who may not share our concerns for user safety,” the company said in its statement about Hot Tub on Monday.  In addition to AltStore, Fortnite maker and longtime Apple foe Epic, recently announced plans to bring third-party mobile games to its Epic Games app in the EU. Though AltStore Pal and Epic aren’t officially affiliated, Epic gave the alternative app store a “MegaGrant” last year to help fund the “core technology fees” third-party app stores are required to pay Apple.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-is-deeply-concerned-about-altstores-porn-app-005013457.html?src=rss",
