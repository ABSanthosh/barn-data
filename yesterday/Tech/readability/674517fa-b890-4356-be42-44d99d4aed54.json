Credit: Ian Moore / Mashable Photo Composite / Bose Save $100: Grab the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones on sale for $329 at Amazon, down from their list price of $429. This 23% discount is live as of March 31, the last day of Amazon's Big Spring Sale. When Bose named their QuietComfort line, they hit the nail right on the head.In that line is the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones, which have been deemed the most comfortable headphones by not one, not two, but three separate reporters from the Mashable shopping team. And as of March 31, the last day of the Big Spring Sale, Amazon marked them down to $329, dropping their price even further from the $80 price cut we spotted earlier in the sale. I personally tested the Bose QC Ultra headphones in the fall of 2023, shortly after they hit the market. I put them through the ringer in testing their comfort — I left them on for entire work days, wore them with earrings, and even on a cross country flight while wearing glasses. In every situation, they felt cushioned and sturdy, but not too heavy. As Lead Shopping Reporter Dylan Haas put it, \"A lot of headphones advertise 'all-day comfort' as a feature, but rarely is that literally true.\" Like me, he was able to use them for an entire day without any soreness.With that said, they're not perfect. While their noise cancelling is good (it is Bose, after all), Shopping Reporter Sam Mangino wasn't totally impressed, writing in her review, \"while the noise cancellation is really good at blocking out low-pitched noises, it can't wholly block high-pitched sounds unless you turn up the sound to unhealthy volumes.\" She also felt that the sound quality didn't stand out among other premium options. Mashable Deals I also found that their multipoint pairing could be inconsistent at times, but that's an issue I've experienced across the board with Bose. While annoying, issues like that are easier to overlook when you're not paying full price. If you are looking to get these headphones at the absolute lowest price ever, you might want to pass this time — we've seen them drop down to $299 in the past.
