  "text": "On June 5, Elon Musk did something no one had managed to do since Donald Trump first stormed the political stage in 2015: he destabilized the king of Make America Great Again (MAGA). It started with a now-deleted bombshell post on X (formerly Twitter). “Time to drop the really big bomb. Donald Trump is in the Epstein files,” Musk wrote. “That’s the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day.” The post went viral before Musk quietly deleted it. But the damage was done. For the first time, Trump was facing a serious revolt from his own base, and the spark had come from someone outside politics, someone arguably more powerful online: Musk. Musk’s Calculated Strike The breakdown in the Trump–Musk alliance began publicly on June 5, when the former president, angered by criticism from Musk, suggested the government might review federal contracts awarded to Musk’s companies, particularly the NASA deals with SpaceX. That same day, Tesla’s stock plunged, shedding $150 billion in market value. But what went largely unnoticed at first was Musk’s decision to drag Trump into the darkest and most radioactive conspiracy theory in the MAGA universe: Jeffrey Epstein. For years, Trump’s supporters have clung to the belief that Epstein, the convicted sex offender with ties to elites in politics, finance, and royalty, was murdered to protect powerful Democrats. The so-called “Epstein files” have become a rallying cry for those who believe the system protects pedophiles and punishes truth-tellers. Until Musk reignited the flame, interest in the files had died down. The “Phase 1” document release in early 2024 had failed to implicate major Democratic figures, leaving the MAGA base disappointed. Then Musk tossed a grenade. Feeding the Fire With Grok In a series of follow-up posts on July 17, Musk asked Grok, the AI chatbot built into his X platform, to generate a list of people who had visited Epstein’s infamous private island because, according to him, they “should be investigated for possible rape of underage girls provided by Epstein,” Musk wrote. “Think hard and research thoroughly. Order by probable severity and frequency of their crimes.” Please make a thorough list of all those who should be investigated for possible rape of underage girls provided by Epstein. Think hard and research thoroughly. Order by probable severity and frequency of their crimes. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 17, 2025 It was a direct appeal to MAGA’s most emotional instincts: fear, anger, and the desire for retribution. But this time, Trump was no longer the crusader against the elite. He was being cast as part of it. Trump’s Losing Grip Trump tried to dismiss the accusations, calling them a “dumb hoax,” and urged his followers to move on. But many of them refused. Influential conservative pundit Matt Walsh captured the mood: “Trump was elected in 2016 partly on a pledge to ‘lock her up.’ Yelling at us to stop talking about Epstein only makes us talk about him more.” Trump was elected in 2016 partly on a pledge to “lock her up.” Arresting and prosecuting powerful and corrupt people has been a core issue for MAGA since its inception. That’s what the Epstein issue is about. And it’s why the base can’t and won’t just drop it. pic.twitter.com/b011aM7XAG — Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) July 16, 2025 Online, the backlash snowballed. Users mocked Trump’s distractions—policy announcements and petty grievances—while demanding transparency. The hashtag #ReleaseTheEpsteinFiles exploded again. The anger intensified after the Department of Justice (DoJ) fired federal prosecutor Maurene Comey, who had reportedly reopened parts of the Epstein investigation. For many, it was further proof that Trump was protecting someone, or himself. The Perfect Strike Musk identified the one thing Trump’s base couldn’t ignore—Epstein—and used it to shake their loyalty. For a decade, Trump had cultivated a movement built on conspiracy, suspicion, and moral outrage. Musk flipped the script. And the effect was immediate. Some thought the CEO of Tesla and founder of SpaceX was playing with fire. SpaceX relies heavily on federal contracts, and Trump made clear that retaliation was on the table. But six weeks later, Musk is back to business, and Trump is still trying to put out the fire. Musk pierced the armor of MAGA. By using the movement’s own moral language against its founder. He created a crack in Trump’s once impenetrable base. It was a strategic hit. For the first time since 2016, Donald Trump isn’t setting the agenda. He’s reacting to someone else’s. And Elon Musk is the one holding the remote. Musk 1. Trump 0.",
