He spent six years spearheading buying guides and consumer tech coverage at Digital Trends.Less than a month after making their debut, the WH-1000XM6 are on sale at Amazon in black, blue, and platinum with a $30 gift card for $448. It’s not a straight cash discount, sure, but if you were already debating picking up Sony’s latest pair of noise-canceling headphones, it makes the $50 price hike over the last-gen XM5 easier to stomach.If you were to ignore the steep price hike, the new XM6 are a welcome improvement over the XM5 in every way. They’re outfitted with Sony’s latest noise-cancellation chip, which allows them to do a better job at drowning out the ambient noise you might encounter on the street, at your local coffee shop, or on your next cross-country flight. Their transparency mode is as natural-sounding as ever, too, and thanks to a new set of drivers, they deliver clearer vocals and the same dynamic, rich sound for which the XM series is known.Design-wise, they also represent an excellent return to form, albeit with a few minor tweaks for added comfort and convenience. They sport a wider headband that’s designed to alleviate pressure during longer listening sessions, along with a redesigned power button that’s easier to distinguish from the onboard ANC button. More importantly, however, they once again collapse with the aid of a joint in each arm, allowing them to take up less room in the included carrying case. As someone who frequently travels with the XM5 — the only pair in the XM series that can’t fold down — I can say the change is greatly appreciated.More ways to save this weekend8BitDo’s Ultimate 2C Wireless Controller has fallen to its lowest price to date at Amazon, where you can grab it in green or purple for an all-time low of $25.49 (about $5 off). The 2C is a great little gamepad for Windows and Android, one you can connect via USB-C, Bluetooth, or a 2.4GHz dongle boasting a 1,000Hz polling rate. It’s also got an extra set of remappable shoulder buttons and Hall effect sticks / triggers, so you needn’t worry about the notorious “Joy-Con drift” that has plagued consoles like the Switch.When it comes to portable batteries, Anker and EcoFlow are the two biggest names that come to mind. Jackery is a close second, though, and now through June 18th, you can save up to $3,300 on various power solutions thanks to the company’s Father’s Day sale. There’s a lot on offer, but the highlight for me is the port-heavy Explorer 1000 power station, which is available for a limited time from Jackery and Amazon for just shy of $500 ($300 off).If you’re big on Android Auto but hate having to plug your phone into your car’s infotainment system, Motorola’s MA1 wireless car adapter is on sale at Best Buy for a new low of $34.99 (50 percent off). The Chromecast-looking USB dongle pairs with smartphones running Android 11 or higher via Bluetooth, allowing you to then transmit data over 5Ghz Wi-Fi. Just ensure your car or aftermarket head unit actually supports Android Auto in the first place.Verge DealsSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.",
