  "text": "Things are about to hit the fan for everybody when The Last of Us returns for season two on April 13. The second season for HBO’s The Last of Us draws ever closer, and a new trailer played at this weekend’s SXSW. Like its game counterpart The Last of Us Part II, the next season is set years after the first. Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) are in a community full of survivors over in Wyoming, trying their best at living normal lives. But it’s easier said than done—not only are Infected still very much in the picture, Joel’s not entirely at peace with his choice to save Ellie and murder the Fireflies at the end of season one. And Ellie…well, she’s having fun being a regular teenage girl, but haunted by the belief that she didn’t really have a part to play in finding a cure after all. If you know the game, you know things only get more brutal from there. Who knows how much of the divisive sequel will be covered this season, but key players like Abby (Kaitlyn Dever), Dina (Isabela Merced), and Jesse (Young Manzino) are present and accounted for. The new trailer provides a tantalizing look at each of them, and the promise of a reckoning coming for Joel and what he did. If you don’t know…well, you’re about to. Several moments from the game are shown throughout, and whether you played it or not, they’re gonna pack a wallop. New episodes of The Last of Us hit HBO beginning Sunday, April 13.
