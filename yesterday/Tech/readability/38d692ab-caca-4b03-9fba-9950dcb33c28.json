  "description": "\"Three Microsoft CEOs walk into a room...\" Satya Nadella posted on X.com, \"and are interviewed by Copilot!\" As part of Microsoft's 50th anniversary celebration, Microsoft CEO Nadella joined former Microsoft CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer in a funny two-minute video (also available on YouTube) in which Nadella asks Copilot for an AI-powered roast of each of them. \"All right Satya,\" Copilot answers. \"Let's spice it up...\" Copilot: Steve, we'll start with you. Your enthusiasm is legendary. But do you ever worry that your energy might short-circuit the AI? I mean, even robots need a coffee break after your pep talks. Steve Ballmer: Come on dude! If you can't handle me, you can't handle a huge percentage of the world's population! We're counting on you! Copilot: Ha ha, fair point Steve. Now Bill, you've got that signature thoughtful gaze. But do you ever think the AI might feel intimidated by your intense thinking face? I mean, it's like it's waiting for a blue screen moment. Bill Gates: I hope so. I mean, it's all I've got left as the AIs get so damn intelligent. It's just that gaze and my willingness to criticize that differentiates me. Copilot: And it's a formidable gaze indeed, Bill. Steve Ballmer: Copilot, would you ever be willing to criticize him? Copilot: Absolutely. Criticism is where growth happens. Now Satya, AI seems to be your best buddy — but ever worry that your deep passion for AI could one day have it running the show, leaving you to just enjoy the ride? Satya Nadella: Well, the day AI can play like the best cricket player that I enjoy, that's the day it can run the show, as far as I'm concerned. Copilot: Touche, Satya. Let's see if it can hit a century in cricket and then we'll talk. This has been a blast, gentlemen. Here's to another 50 years of innovation and adventure. Cheers. Ballmer, Nadella, and Gates: Cheers. Bill Gates: Whatever that means to an AI. Does it drink? Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
