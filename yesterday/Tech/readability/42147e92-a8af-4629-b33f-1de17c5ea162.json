Credit: Sanzaru Games/Meta If you’re new to the Meta Quest 3 or the Meta Quest 3S, there’s a huge world out/in there, but getting started can be a challenge, so I put together a collection of must-haves for \"3 series\" VR devices, with a focus on apps, games, and utilities that take advantage of their improved hardware and mixed-reality capabilities they offer. Both the Quest 3 and the Quest 3S run the same software, so all of the below games and apps will work in either. (While the two devices may run the same software, there are some key differences between the Quest 3 and Quest 3S. If you're wondering which VR headset is superior or trying to decide which to buy, I've done a point-by-point comparison to help you decide.) Credit: Soul Assembly - Stephen Johnson Batman: Arkham Shadows: Previous generations of standalone VR headsets delivered glorified tech demos instead of games, but that's all in the past. The Meta Quest 3 and 3S are powerful enough for AAA experiences, and Batman: Arkham Shadows is the AAA-est. This action-adventure game is as intricate and detailed as any console or PC title but adds full VR immersion; playing it feels like being Batman, and isn't that what everyone has always wanted? As an added bonus, bundles are available that include both Arkham Shadows and a 3 or 3S. Drop Dead: The Cabin: I am in love with the mixed-reality mode of Drop Dead: The Cabin. It replaces the windows and doors of your room with game-specific portals, stocks your house with virtual guns and ammo, and sets zombies loose to kill you. It’s like living in Dawn of the Dead. This mode is a good fit for people who get \"VR sick,\" because you're not fully in virtual reality. Assassin’s Creed: Nexus VR: Another ambitious, AAA game, Nexus combines stealth gaming with virtual reality and the detailed Assassin's Creed universe. Nexus really takes advantage of the beefed-up power of the Quest 3 and 3S and delivers one of the system’s best AAA game experiences. Asgard’s Wrath 2: This action-RPG has earned raves from game reviewers for taking VR gaming to new places and using the medium to tell stories in new ways—it's a noticeable step forward and a hell of a lot of fun. Puzzling Places: If you're into jigsaw-style puzzles, this might change your life. It allows you (or you and a friend if you're playing co-op) to construct elaborate 3D miniatures of real places, and as they come together, they come to life. I can't even describe how mellow, cozy, and addictive this game is, and I don't even like jigsaw puzzles. Smash Drums: If you always picked drums in Rock Band, this is the game for you. Smash Drums' drums are virtual, but the feedback from the controllers does a very impressive job of making drum playing feel tangible, and there's an AR mode to keep you grounded and at home.Vegas Infinite: This free game is for the casuals out there. It lets you gamble virtual money at poker, blackjack, roulette, craps, and slots in virtual casinos, but the people you’re playing with are real. It’s relaxing, social, and takes advantage of the Quest 3 and 3S's pass-through cameras and improved hand and eye tracking, too. Side Quest: This app lets you download and install apps on your Quest 3 and 3S that don’t come from the Meta Store, so if you’re interested in expanding the possibilities of your VR headset, Side Quest is a must. It gives you access to a huge collection of tech demos, games, apps, and more, as well as providing new options for customizing and improving your Quest experience. You’ll also need Side Quest to install Quest Game Optimizer.Quest Games Optimizer: If you’re even a little “serious” about gaming, consider this $10 utility. It allows you to control the resolution on games, letting you up-rez the graphics on many Quest games, as well as letting you control frame rates, record video, and access other settings. Virtual Desktop: Virtual Desktop allows you to wirelessly connect to your computer in virtual reality. Along with streaming videos, browsing the web, and doing anything else your PC does, you can use this to run PCVR games with your Quest 3 or 3S (as long as you are running a Window 10 or 11 PC that’s specced for virtual reality games) unlocking a new level of gameplay.  Credit: Xstadium - Stephen Johnson Bigscreen: This social video-streaming app lets you watch movies and TV with other folks in the Metaverse on the VR equivalent of a 100-foot video screen. You can watch YouTube, Disney+, Twitch, and PlutoTV streams, rent movies, or watch videos stored on your computer, either alone or with others. XStadium: If you’re into sports, XStadium is a mind-blower. It puts you courtside at live NBA games, giving you a fully immersive, 360 degree, you-are-there basketball experience. You can also immerse yourself in UFC fights from the Octagon, and check out X-Games madness, watch some good old fashioned wrestling, and enjoy other sports, either in 360 view or in multi screened mixed reality. DeoVR: You can watch and customize all kinds of video content with this app—it’s not just for porn. But if you’re interested in new thresholds of virtual-reality pornography, this is the go-to video app.  Credit: Sealost Interactive LLC - Stephen Johnson Les Mills BodyCombat: Whether you want to sweat in virtual or mixed reality, Les Mills has you covered. BodyCombat features a ton of martial arts-inspired workouts and knowledgable virtual coaches, and it doesn’t require a subscription. Supernatural: The subscription-based Supernatural is my favorite fitness app for the Quest. I’m a music snob, and finding an app with real music, that I actually like, was downright shocking. The coaches are charismatic, and the workouts are almost as fun as Beat Saber. The Thrill of the Fight 1 and 2: These boxing simulations provides the hardest workout of any app in virtual reality—shadow boxing is no joke—but they're incredibly addictive games too, so you'll want to work out. Thrill of the Fight 2 adds multiplayer, letting you box other Quest users online, but it's currently in early access mode and doesn't offer a single-player experience. Still, early reaction has been very positive towards the head-to-head combat.  Must-have relaxation apps for the Quest 3Pillow: Most VR games are about action and being active; Pillow breaks the trend. It's made to be played on your back in bed, and each of its four \"dreams\" (mini games) are as chill as possible. Activities include stargazing, storytelling, meditation, and my favorite: fishing for other people's thoughts. You cast onto your ceiling, and when you reel in a virtual fish, you hear audio of another user answering an open-ended question like, \"describe something that changed your life.\" It's very strange and calming. TRIPP: This app promises a \"life-changing shift\" and a \"revolutionary approach to mindfulness.\" I don't know about all that, but it's definitely trippy. If you're into guided meditation, breathing exercises, and surreal experiences, check it out. But download the free demo first; the $60 price tag is a bit steep for a sight-unseen experience.
