Best Treadmills of 2025, as Tested by a Runner With Over 15 Years of Experience What is the best treadmill overall? Matrix TF50 Folding Treadmill Best treadmills for 2025, compared How we rate fitness equipment Other treadmills we tested Factors to consider when choosing a treadmill Tips for running on a treadmill How to care for your treadmill I've been running for more than 15 years, so I've had the opportunity to test a treadmill or two. If you're looking to do some light jogging, you'll want to consider different options than someone who is looking for an intense, trainer-led workout providing machine. I tested many machines to find the best for a range of needs and these are my top choices.Treadmills come at a range of prices and can offer advanced technology, touchscreens, streaming platforms for your favorite shows, workout programs, unique hardware and more.I tested several popular treadmills by running, jogging and walking on them, evaluating key factors like who they’re best suited for and what to consider before buying. Since treadmills are a significant investment, I carefully evaluated each one. These were my top picks during testing.Editor's note Jan. 7, 2025: We're currently testing more treadmills and will update this page later in the year. What is the best treadmill overall?The best overall treadmill we tested was hands down the Nordictrack Commercial 2450. It's on the bigger side, but it's worth it if you want all the features that come with a high-tech treadmill. The 22-inch adjustable touchscreen on this treadmill makes it easy to view your workout and to tilt if you'd like to do a separate workout on the floor. It has decline and incline settings, ranging from zero to 15% incline and up to 3% decline, which is not easy to come by on a treadmill. Through Nordictrack's iFit program, you can personalize your own running trail using Google Maps to exercise anywhere in the world. The most elite feature has to be Nordictrack's auto-adjust technology. This allows an iFit virtual instructor to adjust your incline and speed during class, so it feels like you're actually on the terrain featured during your workout. Read more: How to Beat Boredom on the TreadmillBest treadmills of 2025 The first thing I noticed about the NordicTrack Commercial 2450, NordicTrack's newest addition to its commercial treadmill series, is the touchscreen. It has a 22-inch HD touchscreen that resembles a desktop computer screen, so it's huge. It also tilts and pivots so you can adjust it for different uses, like if you want to take workout classes on the floor. The treadmill itself is also on the bigger side since it's a commercial treadmill, but it does fold up using its easylift assist feature, so if space is limited you can always prop up the belt. Assembling this treadmill can take about two and a half hours (as one of CNET's warehouse technicians estimated) and will require at least two people. NordicTrack does offer the option to include assembly in the delivery for an extra $299. This treadmill has both decline and incline options, ranging from zero to 15% incline and up to -3% decline. It's a rarity to find a treadmill that declines, so this is a unique feature. The speeds range from zero to 12 miles per hour and there are quick-touch control buttons on the console, which makes it easier to adjust your speed during interval training. To get the most out of the NordicTrack Commercial 2450, you will need an iFit membership that is included as part of a 30-day free trial upon purchase. Afterward, it will run you $39 a month. Besides treadmill workouts, iFit also offers other types of live and on-demand classes, so you can enjoy a variety of workouts on the floor. The treadmill uses Wi-Fi and Bluetooth so you can connect headphones, a smartwatch or a heart rate monitor. I thought it was a missed opportunity that this treadmill doesn't give you the option to connect your music through Spotify or Apple Music. You'll also want to make sure that you have decent Wi-Fi because it can get spotty if the treadmill has a hard time reading it. During the testing process, I enjoyed the smooth, quiet tread belt of the NordicTrack. This would be an ideal treadmill for both short and tall people since the tread belt is long and wide, and it has a 300-pound max user capacity. Although this treadmill has a touchscreen, it also has buttons for users who like having that option. Right beneath the screen, there's a fan and a console that has buttons that control the incline, decline, start, stop and speed buttons. The cup holders on this treadmill are on each side of the treadmill and are disappointingly on the smaller side. The most they can hold is a bottle or towel and your phone. I'm guessing it was designed this way to keep you focused on your workout instead of fiddling with your phone.I like how you have the option to run or walk in manual mode without taking a class, but iFit itself has a diverse group of classes to pick from. One of the interesting features iFit has is that you can create your own trail using Google Maps to exercise anywhere in the world. For example, if you want to run in Central Park, you can select the location to create that immersive experience during your run. The stand-out feature I was most impressed by was NordicTrack's AutoAdjust technology, which allows an iFit virtual instructor to adjust your incline and speed during class. You could be running or walking in the jungle and you'll notice the treadmill adjust to replicate that terrain. This hands-free option lets you focus on the class without having to fuss with any buttons. It's also a good way for runners who need to train for a race to get the outdoor feel indoors. CNET Score Breakdown Software Ease of Use 8 Functionality 10 Warranty 8 Assembly 10 Features 10 Transform your home and fitness routine with the TF50 treadmill. Its powerful incline and ultrasmooth Johnson Drive system make every workout seamless, whether you’re walking, jogging or sprinting. The extra-long cushioned running surface keeps you comfortable and supported as you push toward your goals. Explore endless entertainment and live training options on its sleek console, turning every session into an exciting adventure. When you’re done, the TF50’s folding design lets you store it neatly, reclaiming your space without compromising on performance or quality. Fitness has never fit so perfectly into your life. If you're familiar with Peloton's exercise equipment, then you know it all shares the same black sleek exterior with touches of red. The Peloton Tread is no different, but its stand-out feature is the 23.8-inch HD touchscreen. This makes it the treadmill with the biggest screen on this list. The Peloton Tread requires plenty of room since it is large and doesn't fold up. It's 59 inches long so it can appropriately fit people of all heights, and you can tell by the width and length of the belt that it can comfortably fit someone over 6 feet tall. It has a 300-pound weight capacity. The Peloton Tread can go up to 12.5 miles per hour and has a maximum 12.5% incline, but no decline option. Its competitors NordicTrack and BowFlex can decline, so I was surprised that Peloton was lacking there. To control the speed, the Peloton Tread has a speed dial on the right and an incline knob on the left. This design is ideal if you're doing intervals, although I found the dial to lag when I tried to change the speed. Regardless, the Tread offers a smooth and mostly quiet ride. Another aspect I observed when testing is that the belt comes to an abrupt halt when you hit stop instead of slowly coming to a stop. This may be part of the safety features Peloton incorporated after the 2021 Peloton Tread recall. The Peloton also has a safety key and a tread lock, which is a four-digit safety pin that you're required to enter to access the treadmill. I found the tread lock to be particularly annoying because I had to enter it every time I walked away from the treadmill momentarily. I understand the need for it and think it's important, especially in a home with pets and children. Peloton doesn't have much to offer as far as a console goes; the plastic cup holder is just big enough to hold two water bottles. There is no fan. It looks a little more bare-bones than I expected considering this is the most expensive treadmill on the list. As with other Peloton exercise equipment, you need the $44-a-month All-Access membership to experience the classes. You also have the option to set it to just run or the scenic run mode so you don't have to actively participate in an instructor-led run class. You can make an account for everyone in your household. I can see Peloton members gravitating towards the Peloton Tread because they're familiar with the software and brand, but the average consumer may be deterred by the high price and prefer a less expensive option.My favorite part about using the Peloton Tread is how crisp and clear the classes are on the HD touchscreen. Even compared to the NordicTrack 2450 which has similar screen dimensions, the Peloton Tread has it beat. You can view the instructor clearly along with your stats at the bottom of the screen and the leaderboard on the right-hand side.The Horizon 7.0 AT treadmill looks like a commercial treadmill at the gym without the bells and whistles. It's also fairly priced and the only treadmill on this list under $1,000. This treadmill took our technician two hours to assemble, but you have the option of white glove delivery and assembly for an additional $349. You will need to make sure you measure out the space in your home since this treadmill is pretty big, measuring 76.5 inches long and 36 inches wide. It does fold up, but similar to some of the other treadmills on this list, you still need to make sure you have enough room to store it upright. One of the first things you'll notice about the Horizon 7.0 AT treadmill is that it doesn't have a touchscreen. Instead, the console has two display screens: a 7-inch LCD screen that shows your metrics during a workout, and right beneath it other smaller screens that display time, speed, distance, calories burned, incline, heart rate and pace. It doesn't have the most modern features and looks like it was designed in the '80s or '90s, but it's still functional. Despite lacking the smart capabilities of its competitors, it's a solid machine with a long belt measuring 60-by-20 inches, long enough for taller individuals to run on comfortably. It has a weight capacity of 325 pounds. The treadmill is on the quieter side, which is good if you're planning on cranking up the speed or doing intervals. Speaking of intervals, Horizon designed this treadmill to have quick-dial knobs on the shorter handles that stick out of the front of the console. The knobs are easy to turn forward to pick up the speed or incline or to turn back if you want to decrease them. The Peloton Tread has a similar feature on the side of its tread, but I found that Horizon's design makes more sense. The Horizon treadmill goes up to 12 miles per hour and can hit an incline of up to 15%. This treadmill doesn't decline. One of the things that sets this treadmill apart from a NordicTrack, BowFlex or even Peloton model is that you aren't required to buy any additional workout programs to use it. You can use it on its own or you can connect it to apps you already own, including iFit or Peloton, Zwift, Nike Run Club and Apple Fitness Plus. You can also connect to apps such as Netflix, Hulu or Spotify. Full transparency: I struggled to connect my phone to the treadmill, despite following the instructions verifying that my Bluetooth was on. Other reviewers have had better luck. CNET contributor Lindsay Boyer previously tested the Horizon T101 (another Horizon treadmill) and was able to successfully connect to the iFit app.Additional features on this treadmill include a fan, heart rate sensors and automatic and manual programs. It also has USB and headphone ports if you need to charge your phone or prefer to wear wired headphones. If you ask me, there's nothing wrong with a treadmill that sticks to the basics.The BowFlex Treadmill 10 is ideal for those looking for a heavy-duty treadmill. It has the highest weight capacity of all the treadmills on this list at 400 pounds -- most cap out at around 300 pounds. It's also the biggest one on the list, measuring 85 by 39.6 by 65.3 inches. According to our technician, assembly took about three and a half hours and can be tedious because of the different pieces you have to install. BowFlex does offer assembly for an additional $349.Upon looking at the BowFlex Treadmill 10, you can tell it's a solidly built machine due to the size of the tread and the wide design. I like how size-inclusive the design is: The space between the handles provides plenty of room to move your arms, and the tread belt is long enough if you have longer strides, so individuals over 6 feet tall will be able to run on it comfortably. The touchscreen on the BowFlex is only 10 inches, so it's smaller than I expected and seems out of place considering how big the body of the treadmill is. I also didn't love how some of the buttons that control the speed and incline are positioned further back on the sides of the treadmill and made of a plastic material. I'm short, so it didn't seem practical to me to reach behind me to change the speed or incline. I could see this being more comfortable for taller people. The upside is that there are handles in front of the console that also have buttons that control the speed and incline. The console is also wide enough to hold your phone or tablet and has one cup holder on each side. The BowFlex Treadmill 10 has incline and decline options and goes up to 12 miles per hour. When you're running, the belt feels smooth and is on the quiet side, despite the minimal whirring sound the motor makes. BowFlex also has a JRNY membership which you need to access the various exercise and treadmill classes. New members get to try JRNY for free the first year, but afterward, it's $20 a month, which is a fair price compared to other memberships. You can also easily sync up your treadmill with the JRNY app on iOS and Android. If you're not in the mood to take a class, you also have the option to use the treadmill in manual mode. You will need to make sure you have an internet router in or close to the room where your treadmill is set up. I didn't experience any issues with the connectivity, but some reviews point out that the classes glitch if the Wi-Fi isn't stable enough. You can also connect the treadmill to your Bluetooth-enabled smart devices and heart rate monitors. I tried connecting it to my Apple Watch but had no luck, which I can see being an issue if you're a runner who wants to track your data. This treadmill can't connect to music streaming services, but it can connect to streaming apps like Hulu or Netflix so you can watch your favorite shows while you work out. When you're done using the treadmill, you can fold it upright by pressing a lever on the lower right-hand side of the belt and lifting it up to close. Although it doesn't close all the way, it does prop up the belt which can help save you space.Unlike the rest of the treadmills on this list, the Echelon Stride was made with limited space in mind, and its sleek all-black exterior will blend into any room. It only took our technician 15 minutes to set up. This treadmill is best for someone on the shorter side since the spacing between the arms and treadmill feels more narrow compared to the BowFlex and NordicTrack treadmills. The belt is also shorter, measuring only 55 inches long. It has a 300-pound weight capacity, which is impressive considering its size. It could pass for a walking treadmill because of how slim it is, but during testing, I was able to comfortably walk and run on it. The speed capabilities are in line with the bigger treadmills, the incline is not as high, and the Echelon Stride doesn't have a decline option. I'd recommend this treadmill if you're going to be using it for shorter runs, jogs and walks because even though it's sturdy and can handle high speed, I'm not certain it will handle intense mileage over time, especially if you're a long-distance runner. It also sometimes lags when you increase the speed. The foot rails are narrow, which makes sense since they fit the size of the treadmill, but I wouldn't be comfortable hopping on them if I suddenly needed to do so mid-workout. The Echelon Stride is more bare-bones than the other treadmills on this list because it doesn't have a touchscreen and is instead controlled by a few buttons beneath the LED console. If you want to access workout programs, you'll need an Echelon membership (up to $35 a month) and the Echelon app on your phone or tablet. If you don't like to rely on additional gadgets to view your workouts, this may not be the best option for you. I had to use my phone and the app worked perfectly fine for me, but truth be told, I would've preferred a built-in screen. The good news is you can connect your Spotify account and other third-party accounts like Strava, Apple Health and Fitbit. The buttons on the Echelon Stride are intuitive and may be preferable for those who don't want smart features. The LED console shows the speed, step count, time, distance, incline and quick speed. This treadmill only has a mesh cup holder to hold a water bottle, which fits its small frame but doesn't hold much else. A big advantage this treadmill has over the rest on this list is that it folds flat so you can store it under your bed or lean it against your wall. It's truly a space saver, unlike other treadmills which just fold upright and still require some space.Best treadmills for 2025, compared TreadmillMaximum speedMaximum inclineMaximum user weightPrice NordicTrack Commercial 2450 12 mph15%300 pounds$2,399BowFlex Treadmill 10 12 mph15%400 pounds$1,799Echelon Stride 12 mph10%300 pounds$1,400Horizon 7.0 AT 12 mph15%325 pounds$999Peloton Tread 12.5 mph12.5%300 pounds$2,995 When we test treadmills, we usually test in our Louisville-based CNET warehouse due to its ample space. On occasion, we will test from home or try a demo at a showroom. Since we are a small team, it can take months of arranging and testing to bring you the most vital information you'll need to know before making your purchase. Show more Over our years of testing, we’ve established a methodology that helps us evaluate and score each piece of fitness equipment we test. We judge fitness equipment based on the following.Features: We look at the types of features offered by these pieces of equipment, how advanced or simple these features are, and whether the machine can connect to built-in or third-party apps or wearables. No matter how advanced it is, it should be intuitive for most people to use.Software: Many of these machines have programs built in, so we look to see how easy they are to use and any challenges we experience when using them. Functionality: When testing, we determine if the machine works as promised. Additionally, we observe how intuitive it is to use, whether it has all the bells and whistles or not. Even if the machine is as simple as it comes, the device should still function as promised. If the machine is more modern, it should still be easy to use by anyone.Assembly: We make note of how long it takes to assemble fitness equipment and if you need an extra set of hands to help. Fitness equipment tends to be heavy so it usually is a two-person job. We also make sure that there's a white glove delivery option if you prefer and make note of the price.Warranty: It’s important to know the warranty information for your equipment in case you need a replacement. Since fitness equipment is an investment you should feel comfortable knowing that you’re getting a top-quality product. If a piece needs replacing, the window for replacement or refund should be clear.Read more on how we test fitness equipment. Show more ProForm Pro 2000: Although ProForm and NordicTrack are manufactured by the same company, I found that the quality of the ProForm did not compare. During testing I was unable to connect my iFit account and the belt did not feel smooth when in use and kept making squeaking sounds. even after our technician adjusted it multiple times. Mobvoi Home Treadmill: Putting together this compact treadmill at home wasn't too complicated, but I noticed some manufacturer defects in the alignment of the handles. Although this didn't affect the ability to use the treadmill, I found this one was better off used for walking instead of higher-impact activities like running or jogging. While jogging on the treadmill I noticed it made loud thumping noises that can be a nuisance if you live in an apartment. The belt is also narrow, therefore I don't think it would be an appropriate pick for taller or larger people.  Show more Treadmills can be a significant investment, so before buying, you'll want to take several factors into account. Budget: set yourself a budget and figure out how much you're willing to spend -- you can get a quality treadmill on a budget, or splurge for extra features. Similarly, determine whether you want a smart treadmill with a touchscreen and virtual classes, or if you prefer a simpler model without a touchscreen that provides basic metrics.Size: Consider the size of the treadmill and how much space you have in your home to fit one. Decide if you want the treadmill to be foldable for saving space and easy storage.Workouts: Take your workout plans into account; do you plan on using it more for running or walking? Consider if multiple people in your household will be using the treadmill and if you need one that can handle various heights and weights. Also, consider whether you're OK with a treadmill that makes some noise or if you prefer it to be silent. Show more There are various ways to use a treadmill that range from walking to running. Below are other workouts you can try out as per our experts' recommendations.Indoor vs. outdoor running: One thing to keep in mind is that the way you run outdoors is going to translate differently indoors. This is why sometimes you'll notice your smartwatch is inconsistent with the pace readings it gives you when you run on a treadmill versus outdoors. Even running indoors can cause your stride to change compared to when you run outside. \"The most transferable metric to outdoor running is pace and incline,\" said Matt Wilpers, a Peloton instructor. Therefore if you are training for a race and plan on mixing it up between outdoor and treadmill runs, these are the key metrics to focus on. Additionally, you have more control over a treadmill workout because you can focus on dialing in your mechanics, breathing and mental focus instead of fixating on your smartwatch for data. Interval training: You can practice interval training on the treadmill by mixing up your easy walk or jogging pace with a fast running or jogging pace. This will vary from person to person, so it's helpful to use your perceived rate of exertion to determine what these speeds are for you. An interval workout can look like running at a fast pace for a minute, followed by a walk or jog for two minutes and alternating between that sequence for 20 minutes and adding in a cooldown. Hill and flats: If you find walking on a treadmill to be monotone, then you can always play around with the incline. Peloton instructor, Rebecca Kennedy said, \"Walking is gentle on the joints while offering an incredible cardio output so you're still able to get conditioned without the impact of running.\" For example, during Peloton hikes (one of the classes she teaches) you have walks that vary from a 4 to 15% incline.\" Take turns with flat and incline intervals. If you are familiar with running on hills, aim to crank up the speed when you're doing a flat interval. Not only will you challenge yourself doing these types of workouts, but you'll target muscles like your glutes, quads and hamstrings. Sprint intervals: If you're trying to improve your speed, sprinting is a good way to achieve this goal. You could play around with the timing and start off with 30 seconds of running at the highest speed you can tolerate and alternate with 30 seconds of walking. As you get more comfortable with sprints, you can add on more time for the sprint. Show more If you're new to the treadmill and are looking for guidance on the proper way to use one, our experts shared the best practices you should be following. Warm-up: As with any workout, you shouldn't neglect the warm-up. At an easy walking pace warm up for five to 10 minutes. Don't hold onto the handrails: If you're running on a treadmill at a pace that's slightly too fast for you, it's tempting to hold onto the console or the handrails. \"This risks injury and it isn't proper treadmill form,\" warns Wilpers. If you find the speed too fast, reduce it until it feels comfortable enough to keep your elbows by your sides. Don't go out too fast: One common mistake some people make is cranking up the speed too soon. Wilpers says, \"Make sure you do an easy warm-up or jog before transitioning into an actual run.\"Use your arms: It's easy to forget about your arms if you're jogging or running on a treadmill, but using your arms by swinging them as you run makes you a more efficient runner. \"Make sure to keep them bent at around 90 degrees and by your sides and not swinging across the body because that is a sign that your torso is rotating too much,\" advises Wilpers. Run tall, run light, run relaxed: If you're running on the treadmill, you want the movement to feel as natural as possible. Wilpers says, \"Throughout runs, perform mental body scans to assess how you are doing from head to toe, including breathing.\" When thinking about your form, running tall means you are maintaining an upright posture with a forward lean from the ankles, whereas running light refers to light quick feet, and running relaxed is relaxing everything else that isn't driving the movement. Who should avoid treadmills: It's important to avoid hopping on a treadmill if you are currently injured, have an illness, recently had surgery or are recently postpartum. \"I would not recommend a tread workout at the moment, but once given clearance by your doctor the tread can likely be a good training tool to get you back in good condition,\" says Kennedy. If you have heart conditions, vertigo, arthritis or disc issues, it's best to consult with your doctor first. Show more If you want your treadmill to last a long time, you'll need to do some maintenance to keep it in good condition. You will need to clean your treadmill to keep it debris-free with a cleanser that's appropriate for gym equipment. Sometimes the treadmill manufacturer will sell the best cleanser for their product on their website. Making sure the safety key (usually found on all treadmills) is fully functioning is also important to make sure your treadmill is still safe to use. According to ProForm, you should check monthly to verify the treadmill belt still has tension and is properly aligned. Usually, the instructional manual will include information on how to adjust your treadmill belt. Additionally, inspect the power cord for any potential damage and check that the bolts and screws on your treadmill are still screwed in tight. Over time and use, some of these pieces can come loose so they may need to be tightened up occasionally. Another aspect to look at is if the treadmill needs lubrication. When you purchase your treadmill, you'll notice that your package probably came with a small tube of lubrication. This is to keep the treadmill belt in good condition since the lubrication can dry up over time. According to NordicTrack, if the treadmill isn't properly lubricated it can affect the way it works by making the belt stick and can even cause it to overheat. For proper instructions on how to lubricate your treadmill, adhere to the instruction manual or call the manufacturer's customer service number for assistance.Finally, if you've done all the inspections required and notice that your treadmill belt is worse for wear, it may be time to replace it. Make sure you have the model number of your treadmill on hand before reordering a replacement belt. Follow the instructions on the manufacturer's website or owner manual to make sure that you're installing it correctly.  Show more Which is better: A treadmill or elliptical? How do you lubricate a treadmill? According to NordicTrack, you'll need to buy a nonsilicone-based treadmill lubricant from the treadmill supplier. Follow its recommended steps to properly lubricate your treadmill. Show more How much do treadmills cost? The cost of a treadmill will depend on the type and quality of the treadmill you're looking for. You can find treadmills under $1,000, but they may lack the sturdiness and capacity that a more expensive option provides. If you want a treadmill with special features you can expect to spend upwards of $1,000, with more expensive models ranging anywhere from $3,000 to $5,000.  Show more How long do treadmills last? Is a treadmill bad for your knees? Running on a 0% incline or high incline can increase your chances of injuring your knee and shin splints or other issues. According to orthopedic surgeon Kevin D. Plancher, running at lower inclines is safer for the knees. He suggests running at a 1 to 3% incline to prevent unnatural movement patterns that normally occur at a 0% incline setting. This helps relieve pressure from the knees and instead ends up working more of your glutes and hamstrings. Show more",

It\u0026#39;s on the bigger side, but it\u0026#39;s worth it if you want all the features that come with a high-tech treadmill. The 22-inch adjustable touchscreen on this treadmill makes it easy to view your workout and to tilt if you\u0026#39;d like to do a separate workout on the floor. It has decline and incline settings, ranging from zero to 15% incline and up to 3% decline, which is not easy to come by on a treadmill. Through Nordictrack\u0026#39;s iFit program, you can personalize your own running trail using Google Maps to exercise anywhere in the world. The most elite feature has to be Nordictrack\u0026#39;s auto-adjust technology. This allows an iFit virtual instructor to adjust your incline and speed during class, so it feels like you\u0026#39;re actually on the terrain featured during your workout. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-keep=\"\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRead more: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca data-id=\"5027a41f-eb95-4f0a-8b0f-86204c800078\" href=\"https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/make-treadmill-running-more-fun/\" target=\"_self\"\u003eHow to Beat Boredom on the Treadmill\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"303323d1-1a10-4899-b660-1c945bf54d00\" data-ng-block=\"{\" id\":\"yij76ey0ye090ma\",\"type\":\"heading\"}\"=\"\" data-keep=\"\" data-id=\"303323d1-1a10-4899-b660-1c945bf54d00\"\u003eBest treadmills of 2025\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"22531887-4fec-4338-a235-a6fb53d31ee8\" section=\"cap\" data-id=\"listicle-22531887-4fec-4338-a235-a6fb53d31ee8\" data-techprodid=\"033e5f90-c49a-4b9f-8007-9d9963466704\" data-cy=\"bestListListicle\" content=\"LIST ITEM\" superlative=\"Best overall treadmill\" description=\"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The first thing I noticed about the NordicTrack Commercial 2450, NordicTrack\u0026#39;s newest addition to its commercial treadmill series, is the touchscreen. It has a 22-inch HD touchscreen that resembles a desktop computer screen, so it\u0026#39;s huge. It also tilts and pivots so you can adjust it for different uses, like if you want to take workout classes on the floor. The treadmill itself is also on the bigger side since it\u0026#39;s a commercial treadmill, but it does fold up using its easylift assist feature, so if space is limited you can always prop up the belt. Assembling this treadmill can take about two and a half hours (as one of CNET\u0026#39;s warehouse technicians estimated) and will require at least two people. NordicTrack does offer the option to include assembly in the delivery for an extra $299.\u0026amp;nbsp;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This treadmill has both decline and incline options, ranging from zero to 15% incline and up to -3% decline. It\u0026#39;s a rarity to find a treadmill that declines, so this is a unique feature. The speeds range from zero to 12 miles per hour and there are quick-touch control buttons on the console, which makes it easier to adjust your speed during interval training.\u0026amp;nbsp;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;To get the most out of the NordicTrack Commercial 2450, you will need an iFit membership that is included as part of a 30-day free trial upon purchase. Afterward, it will run you $39 a month. Besides treadmill workouts, iFit also offers other types of live and on-demand classes, so you can enjoy a variety of workouts on the floor. The treadmill uses Wi-Fi and Bluetooth so you can connect headphones, a smartwatch or a heart rate monitor. I thought it was a missed opportunity that this treadmill doesn\u0026#39;t give you the option to connect your music through Spotify or Apple Music. You\u0026#39;ll also want to make sure that you have decent Wi-Fi because it can get spotty if the treadmill has a hard time reading it.\u0026amp;nbsp;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;During the testing process, I enjoyed the smooth, quiet tread belt of the NordicTrack. This would be an ideal treadmill for both short and tall people since the tread belt is long and wide, and it has a 300-pound max user capacity. Although this treadmill has a touchscreen, it also has buttons for users who like having that option. Right beneath the screen, there\u0026#39;s a fan and a console that has buttons that control the incline, decline, start, stop and speed buttons. The cup holders on this treadmill are on each side of the treadmill and are disappointingly on the smaller side. The most they can hold is a bottle or towel and your phone. I\u0026#39;m guessing it was designed this way to keep you focused on your workout instead of fiddling with your phone.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I like how you have the option to run or walk in manual mode without taking a class, but iFit itself has a diverse group of classes to pick from. One of the interesting features iFit has is that you can create your own trail using Google Maps to exercise anywhere in the world. For example, if you want to run in Central Park, you can select the location to create that immersive experience during your run.\u0026amp;nbsp;The stand-out feature I was most impressed by was NordicTrack\u0026#39;s AutoAdjust technology, which allows an iFit virtual instructor to adjust your incline and speed during class.

It has a 22-inch HD touchscreen that resembles a desktop computer screen, so it\u0026#39;s huge. It also tilts and pivots so you can adjust it for different uses, like if you want to take workout classes on the floor. The treadmill itself is also on the bigger side since it\u0026#39;s a commercial treadmill, but it does fold up using its easylift assist feature, so if space is limited you can always prop up the belt. Assembling this treadmill can take about two and a half hours (as one of CNET\u0026#39;s warehouse technicians estimated) and will require at least two people. NordicTrack does offer the option to include assembly in the delivery for an extra $299. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis treadmill has both decline and incline options, ranging from zero to 15% incline and up to -3% decline. It\u0026#39;s a rarity to find a treadmill that declines, so this is a unique feature. The speeds range from zero to 12 miles per hour and there are quick-touch control buttons on the console, which makes it easier to adjust your speed during interval training. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo get the most out of the NordicTrack Commercial 2450, you will need an iFit membership that is included as part of a 30-day free trial upon purchase. Afterward, it will run you $39 a month. Besides treadmill workouts, iFit also offers other types of live and on-demand classes, so you can enjoy a variety of workouts on the floor. The treadmill uses Wi-Fi and Bluetooth so you can connect headphones, a smartwatch or a heart rate monitor. I thought it was a missed opportunity that this treadmill doesn\u0026#39;t give you the option to connect your music through Spotify or Apple Music. You\u0026#39;ll also want to make sure that you have decent Wi-Fi because it can get spotty if the treadmill has a hard time reading it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring the testing process, I enjoyed the smooth, quiet tread belt of the NordicTrack. This would be an ideal treadmill for both short and tall people since the tread belt is long and wide, and it has a 300-pound max user capacity. Although this treadmill has a touchscreen, it also has buttons for users who like having that option. Right beneath the screen, there\u0026#39;s a fan and a console that has buttons that control the incline, decline, start, stop and speed buttons. The cup holders on this treadmill are on each side of the treadmill and are disappointingly on the smaller side. The most they can hold is a bottle or towel and your phone. I\u0026#39;m guessing it was designed this way to keep you focused on your workout instead of fiddling with your phone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI like how you have the option to run or walk in manual mode without taking a class, but iFit itself has a diverse group of classes to pick from. One of the interesting features iFit has is that you can create your own trail using Google Maps to exercise anywhere in the world. For example, if you want to run in Central Park, you can select the location to create that immersive experience during your run. The stand-out feature I was most impressed by was NordicTrack\u0026#39;s AutoAdjust technology, which allows an iFit virtual instructor to adjust your incline and speed during class. You could be running or walking in the jungle and you\u0026#39;ll notice the treadmill adjust to replicate that terrain. This hands-free option lets you focus on the class without having to fuss with any buttons. It\u0026#39;s also a good way for runners who need to train for a race to get the outdoor feel indoors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv data-cy=\"bestListListicle_leftRail\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eCNET Score Breakdown\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n                    Software Ease of Use\n                  \u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\n                    8\n                  \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n                    Functionality\n                  \u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\n                    10\n                  \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n                    Warranty\n                  \u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\n                    8\n                  \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n                    Assembly\n                  \u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\n                    10\n                  \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n                    Features\n                  \u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\n                    10\n                  \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"9577ee39-387b-4246-9452-60f0f57d1145\" section=\"cap\" data-id=\"listicle-9577ee39-387b-4246-9452-60f0f57d1145\" data-cy=\"bestListListicle\" content=\"LIST ITEM\" superlative=\"Foldable design with premium running features\" description=\"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Transform your home and fitness routine with the TF50 treadmill.

The Peloton Tread is no different, but its stand-out feature is the 23.8-inch HD touchscreen. This makes it the treadmill with the biggest screen on this list. The Peloton Tread requires plenty of room since it is large and doesn\u0026#39;t fold up. It\u0026#39;s 59 inches long so it can appropriately fit people of all heights, and you can tell by the width and length of the belt that it can comfortably fit someone over 6 feet tall. It has a 300-pound weight capacity. The Peloton Tread can go up to 12.5 miles per hour and has a maximum 12.5% incline, but no decline option. Its competitors NordicTrack and BowFlex can decline, so I was surprised that Peloton was lacking there.\u0026amp;nbsp;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;To control the speed, the Peloton Tread has a speed dial on the right and an incline knob on the left.

The Peloton Tread is no different, but its stand-out feature is the 23.8-inch HD touchscreen. This makes it the treadmill with the biggest screen on this list. The Peloton Tread requires plenty of room since it is large and doesn\u0026#39;t fold up. It\u0026#39;s 59 inches long so it can appropriately fit people of all heights, and you can tell by the width and length of the belt that it can comfortably fit someone over 6 feet tall. It has a 300-pound weight capacity. The Peloton Tread can go up to 12.5 miles per hour and has a maximum 12.5% incline, but no decline option. Its competitors NordicTrack and BowFlex can decline, so I was surprised that Peloton was lacking there. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo control the speed, the Peloton Tread has a speed dial on the right and an incline knob on the left.

It\u0026#39;s also fairly priced and the only treadmill on this list under $1,000. This treadmill took our technician two hours to assemble, but you have the option of white glove delivery and assembly for an additional $349. You will need to make sure you measure out the space in your home since this treadmill is pretty big, measuring 76.5 inches long and 36 inches wide. It does fold up, but similar to some of the other treadmills on this list, you still need to make sure you have enough room to store it upright.\u0026amp;nbsp;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;One of the first things you\u0026#39;ll notice about the Horizon 7.0 AT treadmill is that it doesn\u0026#39;t have a touchscreen. Instead, the console has two display screens: a 7-inch LCD screen that shows your metrics during a workout, and right beneath it other smaller screens that display time, speed, distance, calories burned, incline, heart rate and pace. It doesn\u0026#39;t have the most modern features and looks like it was designed in the \u0026#39;80s or \u0026#39;90s, but it\u0026#39;s still functional.\u0026amp;nbsp;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Despite lacking the smart capabilities of its competitors, it\u0026#39;s a solid machine with a long belt measuring 60-by-20 inches, long enough for taller individuals to run on comfortably. It has a weight capacity of 325 pounds. The treadmill is on the quieter side, which is good if you\u0026#39;re planning on cranking up the speed or doing intervals. Speaking of intervals, Horizon designed this treadmill to have quick-dial knobs on the shorter handles that stick out of the front of the console. The knobs are easy to turn forward to pick up the speed or incline or to turn back if you want to decrease them. The Peloton Tread has a similar feature on the side of its tread, but I found that Horizon\u0026#39;s design makes more sense. The Horizon treadmill goes up to 12 miles per hour and can hit an incline of up to 15%. This treadmill doesn\u0026#39;t decline.\u0026amp;nbsp;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;One of the things that sets this treadmill apart from a NordicTrack, BowFlex or even Peloton model is that you aren\u0026#39;t required to buy any additional workout programs to use it. You can use it on its own or you can connect it to apps you already own, including iFit or Peloton, Zwift, Nike Run Club and Apple Fitness Plus. You can also connect to apps such as Netflix, Hulu or Spotify. Full transparency: I struggled to connect my phone to the treadmill, despite following the instructions verifying that my Bluetooth was on. Other reviewers have had better luck.

It\u0026#39;s also fairly priced and the only treadmill on this list under $1,000. This treadmill took our technician two hours to assemble, but you have the option of white glove delivery and assembly for an additional $349. You will need to make sure you measure out the space in your home since this treadmill is pretty big, measuring 76.5 inches long and 36 inches wide. It does fold up, but similar to some of the other treadmills on this list, you still need to make sure you have enough room to store it upright. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the first things you\u0026#39;ll notice about the Horizon 7.0 AT treadmill is that it doesn\u0026#39;t have a touchscreen. Instead, the console has two display screens: a 7-inch LCD screen that shows your metrics during a workout, and right beneath it other smaller screens that display time, speed, distance, calories burned, incline, heart rate and pace. It doesn\u0026#39;t have the most modern features and looks like it was designed in the \u0026#39;80s or \u0026#39;90s, but it\u0026#39;s still functional. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite lacking the smart capabilities of its competitors, it\u0026#39;s a solid machine with a long belt measuring 60-by-20 inches, long enough for taller individuals to run on comfortably. It has a weight capacity of 325 pounds. The treadmill is on the quieter side, which is good if you\u0026#39;re planning on cranking up the speed or doing intervals. Speaking of intervals, Horizon designed this treadmill to have quick-dial knobs on the shorter handles that stick out of the front of the console. The knobs are easy to turn forward to pick up the speed or incline or to turn back if you want to decrease them. The Peloton Tread has a similar feature on the side of its tread, but I found that Horizon\u0026#39;s design makes more sense. The Horizon treadmill goes up to 12 miles per hour and can hit an incline of up to 15%. This treadmill doesn\u0026#39;t decline. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the things that sets this treadmill apart from a NordicTrack, BowFlex or even Peloton model is that you aren\u0026#39;t required to buy any additional workout programs to use it. You can use it on its own or you can connect it to apps you already own, including iFit or Peloton, Zwift, Nike Run Club and Apple Fitness Plus. You can also connect to apps such as Netflix, Hulu or Spotify. Full transparency: I struggled to connect my phone to the treadmill, despite following the instructions verifying that my Bluetooth was on. Other reviewers have had better luck. CNET contributor Lindsay Boyer previously tested the Horizon T101 (another Horizon treadmill) and was able to successfully connect to the iFit app.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdditional features on this treadmill include a fan, heart rate sensors and automatic and manual programs. It also has USB and headphone ports if you need to charge your phone or prefer to wear wired headphones. If you ask me, there\u0026#39;s nothing wrong with a treadmill that sticks to the basics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"1537950b-f59d-46c7-9c0d-edbd5dfada13\" section=\"cap\" data-id=\"listicle-1537950b-f59d-46c7-9c0d-edbd5dfada13\" data-techprodid=\"c1c23a8d-3426-4c54-b0ea-0e469640fc38\" data-cy=\"bestListListicle\" content=\"LIST ITEM\" superlative=\"Best heavy duty treadmill\" description=\"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The BowFlex Treadmill 10 is ideal for those looking for a heavy-duty treadmill. It has the highest weight capacity of all the treadmills on this list at 400 pounds -- most cap out at around 300 pounds. It\u0026#39;s also the biggest one on the list, measuring 85 by 39.6 by 65.3 inches. According to our technician, assembly took about three and a half hours and can be tedious because of the different pieces you have to install. BowFlex does offer assembly for an additional $349.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Upon looking at the BowFlex Treadmill 10, you can tell it\u0026#39;s a solidly built machine due to the size of the tread and the wide design. I like how size-inclusive the design is: The space between the handles provides plenty of room to move your arms, and the tread belt is long enough if you have longer strides, so individuals over 6 feet tall will be able to run on it comfortably.\u0026amp;nbsp;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The touchscreen on the BowFlex is only 10 inches, so it\u0026#39;s smaller than I expected and seems out of place considering how big the body of the treadmill is. I also didn\u0026#39;t love how some of the buttons that control the speed and incline are positioned further back on the sides of the treadmill and made of a plastic material. I\u0026#39;m short, so it didn\u0026#39;t seem practical to me to reach behind me to change the speed or incline. I could see this being more comfortable for taller people. The upside is that there are handles in front of the console that also have buttons that control the speed and incline. The console is also wide enough to hold your phone or tablet and has one cup holder on each side.\u0026amp;nbsp;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The BowFlex Treadmill 10 has incline and decline options and goes up to 12 miles per hour. When you\u0026#39;re running, the belt feels smooth and is on the quiet side, despite the minimal whirring sound the motor makes. BowFlex also has a JRNY membership which you need to access the various exercise and treadmill classes. New members get to try JRNY for free the first year, but afterward, it\u0026#39;s $20 a month, which is a fair price compared to other memberships. You can also easily sync up your treadmill with the JRNY app on iOS and Android. If you\u0026#39;re not in the mood to take a class, you also have the option to use the treadmill in manual mode. You will need to make sure you have an internet router in or close to the room where your treadmill is set up. I didn\u0026#39;t experience any issues with the connectivity, but some reviews point out that the classes glitch if the Wi-Fi isn\u0026#39;t stable enough. You can also connect the treadmill to your Bluetooth-enabled smart devices and heart rate monitors. I tried connecting it to my Apple Watch but had no luck, which I can see being an issue if you\u0026#39;re a runner who wants to track your data. This treadmill can\u0026#39;t connect to music streaming services, but it can connect to streaming apps like Hulu or Netflix so you can watch your favorite shows while you work out.\u0026amp;nbsp;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;When you\u0026#39;re done using the treadmill, you can fold it upright by pressing a lever on the lower right-hand side of the belt and lifting it up to close. Although it doesn\u0026#39;t close all the way, it does prop up the belt which can help save you space.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\" page-position=\"\" linktext=\"\" linkurl=\"\" like=\"~ Can handle people of different weights and sizes ~ JRNY membership is affordable ~ Has decline and incline options ~ Can stream third-party apps like Hulu and Netflix ~Highest decline option of all the treadmills on the list ~Belt length is appropriate for even taller people\" dislike=\"~ Expensive ~ It\u0026#39;s large and requires adequate space ~ May not connect to all wearables\" can-collapse=\"true\" can-truncate=\"true\" truncate-on-page-load=\"true\" offer=\"{\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;c1c23a8d-3426-4c54-b0ea-0e469640fc38\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;label\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Bowflex Treadmill 10\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;slug\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;bowflex-treadmill-10\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;edition\u0026#34;:[\u0026#34;us\u0026#34;],\u0026#34;imageId\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imgUrl\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imageHeight\u0026#34;:0,\u0026#34;imageWidth\u0026#34;:0,\u0026#34;typeLabel\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Product\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;objectType\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;content_product\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;icon\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;}\" techobjectinfo=\"{\u0026#34;uuid\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;c1c23a8d-3426-4c54-b0ea-0e469640fc38\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;slug\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;bowflex-treadmill-10\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Bowflex Treadmill 10\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;productType\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;PRODUCT\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;updateType\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;PRISM\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;mod\u0026#34;:1737677383620}\" overridecredit=\"Giselle Castro-Sloboda/CNET\" overridecaption=\"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The Bowflex Treadmill 10 is ideal for users of all weights, heights and sizes.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\" imagegroup=\"{\u0026#34;uuid\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0b885a84-67f2-47b5-9361-0e0121d1a857\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;alt\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Bowflex Treadmill 10 in CNET lab\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;caption\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The Bowflex Treadmill 10 is ideal for users of all weights, heights and sizes.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;credits\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Giselle Castro-Sloboda/ CNET\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imageData\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0b885a84-67f2-47b5-9361-0e0121d1a857\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;filename\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;bowflex.png\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;path\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/8b1fdc60fefbfb7ec332729ddd6e5169b5f8dba3/hub/2023/03/08/0b885a84-67f2-47b5-9361-0e0121d1a857/bowflex.png?auto=webp\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;height=500\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;dateCreated\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;date\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;2023-03-08 12:38:27.000000\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;timezone\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;UTC\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;timezone_type\u0026#34;:3},\u0026#34;primeColor\u0026#34;:null,\u0026#34;hasWarning\u0026#34;:false},\u0026#34;size\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;float\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;lightbox\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;imageUrl\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/8b1fdc60fefbfb7ec332729ddd6e5169b5f8dba3/hub/2023/03/08/0b885a84-67f2-47b5-9361-0e0121d1a857/bowflex.png?auto=webp\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;height=500\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imageCaption\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The Bowflex Treadmill 10 is ideal for users of all weights, heights and sizes.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imageCredit\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Giselle Castro-Sloboda/ CNET\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imageAltText\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Bowflex Treadmill 10 in CNET lab\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imageFilename\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;bowflex.png\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imageWidth\u0026#34;:1280,\u0026#34;imageHeight\u0026#34;:720,\u0026#34;imageDoNotCrop\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;imageDoNotResize\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;imageWatermark\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;imageDateCreated\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;2023-03-08\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imageParallax\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imageCrop\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imageEnlarge\u0026#34;:false}\" usepricing=\"false\" ng-block=\"{\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;nl4v8u7b4fmkkkk\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;type\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;listicle\u0026#34;}\" edition=\"us\" data-key=\"cnetlisticle__1537950b-f59d-46c7-9c0d-edbd5dfada13\" index=\"5\" contenttype=\"Best List - Precap\" pagelayout=\"Default - Article Page\" tagslugs=\"gap-project,bl-promo-banner,hv28,freelance-update,sponsored-listicle\" isbestlistredesign=\"true\" imagecredit=\"Giselle Castro-Sloboda/CNET\" imagealttext=\"Bowflex Treadmill 10 in CNET lab\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe BowFlex Treadmill 10 is ideal for those looking for a heavy-duty treadmill.

BowFlex does offer assembly for an additional $349.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUpon looking at the BowFlex Treadmill 10, you can tell it\u0026#39;s a solidly built machine due to the size of the tread and the wide design. I like how size-inclusive the design is: The space between the handles provides plenty of room to move your arms, and the tread belt is long enough if you have longer strides, so individuals over 6 feet tall will be able to run on it comfortably. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe touchscreen on the BowFlex is only 10 inches, so it\u0026#39;s smaller than I expected and seems out of place considering how big the body of the treadmill is. I also didn\u0026#39;t love how some of the buttons that control the speed and incline are positioned further back on the sides of the treadmill and made of a plastic material. I\u0026#39;m short, so it didn\u0026#39;t seem practical to me to reach behind me to change the speed or incline. I could see this being more comfortable for taller people. The upside is that there are handles in front of the console that also have buttons that control the speed and incline. The console is also wide enough to hold your phone or tablet and has one cup holder on each side. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe BowFlex Treadmill 10 has incline and decline options and goes up to 12 miles per hour. When you\u0026#39;re running, the belt feels smooth and is on the quiet side, despite the minimal whirring sound the motor makes. BowFlex also has a JRNY membership which you need to access the various exercise and treadmill classes. New members get to try JRNY for free the first year, but afterward, it\u0026#39;s $20 a month, which is a fair price compared to other memberships. You can also easily sync up your treadmill with the JRNY app on iOS and Android. If you\u0026#39;re not in the mood to take a class, you also have the option to use the treadmill in manual mode. You will need to make sure you have an internet router in or close to the room where your treadmill is set up. I didn\u0026#39;t experience any issues with the connectivity, but some reviews point out that the classes glitch if the Wi-Fi isn\u0026#39;t stable enough. You can also connect the treadmill to your Bluetooth-enabled smart devices and heart rate monitors. I tried connecting it to my Apple Watch but had no luck, which I can see being an issue if you\u0026#39;re a runner who wants to track your data. This treadmill can\u0026#39;t connect to music streaming services, but it can connect to streaming apps like Hulu or Netflix so you can watch your favorite shows while you work out. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you\u0026#39;re done using the treadmill, you can fold it upright by pressing a lever on the lower right-hand side of the belt and lifting it up to close. Although it doesn\u0026#39;t close all the way, it does prop up the belt which can help save you space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"7f77300b-a06e-416b-81ed-648e69676262\" section=\"cap\" data-id=\"listicle-7f77300b-a06e-416b-81ed-648e69676262\" data-techprodid=\"1d893787-7711-4e3d-b38a-3fe085cf92e9\" data-cy=\"bestListListicle\" content=\"LIST ITEM\" superlative=\"Best compact treadmill\" description=\"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Unlike the rest of the treadmills on this list, the Echelon Stride was made with limited space in mind, and its sleek all-black exterior will blend into any room. It only took our technician 15 minutes to set up. This treadmill is best for someone on the shorter side since the spacing between the arms and treadmill feels more narrow compared to the BowFlex and NordicTrack treadmills. The belt is also shorter, measuring only 55 inches long. It has a 300-pound weight capacity, which is impressive considering its size. It could pass for a walking treadmill because of how slim it is, but during testing, I was able to comfortably walk and run on it. The speed capabilities are in line with the bigger treadmills, the incline is not as high, and the Echelon Stride doesn\u0026#39;t have a decline option.\u0026amp;nbsp;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I\u0026#39;d recommend this treadmill if you\u0026#39;re going to be using it for shorter runs, jogs and walks because even though it\u0026#39;s sturdy and can handle high speed, I\u0026#39;m not certain it will handle intense mileage over time, especially if you\u0026#39;re a long-distance runner. It also sometimes lags when you increase the speed. The foot rails are narrow, which makes sense since they fit the size of the treadmill, but I wouldn\u0026#39;t be comfortable hopping on them if I suddenly needed to do so mid-workout.\u0026amp;nbsp;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The Echelon Stride is more bare-bones than the other treadmills on this list because it doesn\u0026#39;t have a touchscreen and is instead controlled by a few buttons beneath the LED console. If you want to access workout programs, you\u0026#39;ll need an Echelon membership (up to $35 a month) and the Echelon app on your phone or tablet. If you don\u0026#39;t like to rely on additional gadgets to view your workouts, this may not be the best option for you. I had to use my phone and the app worked perfectly fine for me, but truth be told, I would\u0026#39;ve preferred a built-in screen. The good news is you can connect your Spotify account and other third-party accounts like Strava, Apple Health and Fitbit.\u0026amp;nbsp;The buttons on the Echelon Stride are intuitive and may be preferable for those who don\u0026#39;t want smart features. The LED console shows the speed, step count, time, distance, incline and quick speed.

Although this didn\u0026#39;t affect the ability to use the treadmill, I found this one was better off used for walking instead of higher-impact activities like running or jogging. While jogging on the treadmill I noticed it made loud thumping noises that can be a nuisance if you live in an apartment. The belt is also narrow, therefore I don\u0026#39;t think it would be an appropriate pick for taller or larger people. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca data-cy=\"infoCard_showMore\"\u003e\n      Show more\n    \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-cy=\"infoCard\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-cy=\"infoCardDek\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eTreadmills can be a significant investment, so before buying, you\u0026#39;ll want to take several factors into account. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBudget:\u003c/strong\u003e set yourself a budget and figure out how much you\u0026#39;re willing to spend -- you can get a quality treadmill on a budget, or splurge for extra features.

This is why sometimes you\u0026#39;ll notice your smartwatch is inconsistent with the pace readings it gives you when you run on a treadmill versus outdoors. Even running indoors can cause your stride to change compared to when you run outside. \u0026#34;The most transferable metric to outdoor running is pace and incline,\u0026#34; said Matt Wilpers, a Peloton instructor. Therefore if you are training for a race and plan on mixing it up between outdoor and treadmill runs, these are the key metrics to focus on. Additionally, you have more control over a treadmill workout because you can focus on dialing in your mechanics, breathing and mental focus instead of fixating on your smartwatch for data. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInterval training:\u003c/strong\u003e You can practice interval training on the treadmill by mixing up your easy walk or jogging pace with a fast running or jogging pace.

Peloton instructor, Rebecca Kennedy said, \u0026#34;Walking is gentle on the joints while offering an incredible cardio output so you\u0026#39;re still able to get conditioned without the impact of running.\u0026#34; For example, during Peloton hikes (one of the classes she teaches) you have walks that vary from a 4 to 15% incline.\u0026#34; Take turns with \u003ca target=\"_self\" data-id=\"eebd9dc0-c2ba-4813-8b3c-3e8812f06e5e\" href=\"https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/4-treadmill-workouts-you-can-do-to-torch-calories-get-faster-and-improve-endurance/\"\u003eflat and incline intervals\u003c/a\u003e. If you are familiar with running on hills, aim to crank up the speed when you\u0026#39;re doing a flat interval. Not only will you challenge yourself doing these types of workouts, but you\u0026#39;ll target muscles like your glutes, quads and hamstrings. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSprint intervals: \u003c/strong\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re trying to improve your speed, sprinting is a good way to achieve this goal. You could play around with the timing and start off with 30 seconds of running at the highest speed you can tolerate and alternate with 30 seconds of walking. As you get more comfortable with sprints, you can add on more time for the sprint.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca data-cy=\"infoCard_showMore\"\u003e\n      Show more\n    \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-cy=\"infoCard\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-cy=\"infoCardDek\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re new to the treadmill and are looking for guidance on the proper way to use one, our experts shared the best practices you should be following. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWarm-up: \u003c/strong\u003eAs with any workout, you shouldn\u0026#39;t neglect the warm-up.

If you find the speed too fast, reduce it until it feels comfortable enough to keep your elbows by your sides. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon\u0026#39;t go out too fast: \u003c/strong\u003eOne common mistake some people make is cranking up the speed too soon.

Wilpers says, \u0026#34;Throughout runs, perform mental body scans to assess how you are doing from head to toe, including breathing.\u0026#34; When thinking about your form, running tall means you are maintaining an upright posture with a forward lean from the ankles, whereas running light refers to light quick feet, and running relaxed is relaxing everything else that isn\u0026#39;t driving the movement. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho should avoid treadmills:\u003c/strong\u003e It\u0026#39;s important to avoid hopping on a treadmill if you are currently injured, have an illness, recently had surgery or are recently postpartum. \u0026#34;I would not recommend a tread workout at the moment, but once given clearance by your doctor the tread can likely be a good training tool to get you back in good condition,\u0026#34; says Kennedy. If you have heart conditions, vertigo, arthritis or disc issues, it\u0026#39;s best to consult with your doctor first. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca data-cy=\"infoCard_showMore\"\u003e\n      Show more\n    \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-cy=\"infoCard\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-cy=\"infoCardDek\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you want your treadmill to last a long time, you\u0026#39;ll need to do some maintenance to keep it in good condition. You will need to clean your treadmill to keep it debris-free with a cleanser that\u0026#39;s appropriate for gym equipment. Sometimes the treadmill manufacturer will sell the best cleanser for their product on their website. Making sure the safety key (usually found on all treadmills) is fully functioning is also important to make sure your treadmill is still safe to use. According to ProForm, you should check monthly to verify the treadmill belt still has tension and is properly aligned. Usually, the instructional manual will include information on how to adjust your treadmill belt. Additionally, inspect the power cord for any potential damage and check that the bolts and screws on your treadmill are still screwed in tight. Over time and use, some of these pieces can come loose so they may need to be tightened up occasionally. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother aspect to look at is if the treadmill needs lubrication. When you purchase your treadmill, you\u0026#39;ll notice that your package probably came with a small tube of lubrication. This is to keep the treadmill belt in good condition since the lubrication can dry up over time. According to NordicTrack, if the treadmill isn\u0026#39;t properly lubricated it can affect the way it works by making the belt stick and can even cause it to overheat. For proper instructions on how to lubricate your treadmill, adhere to the instruction manual or call the manufacturer\u0026#39;s customer service number for assistance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, if you\u0026#39;ve done all the inspections required and notice that your treadmill belt is worse for wear, it may be time to replace it. Make sure you have the model number of your treadmill on hand before reordering a replacement belt. Follow the instructions on the manufacturer\u0026#39;s website or owner manual to make sure that you\u0026#39;re installing it correctly. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca data-cy=\"infoCard_showMore\"\u003e\n      Show more\n    \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-cy=\"infoCard\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"\" data-cy=\"shortcodeListicle\" data-id=\"listicle-be18138b-b290-48e6-aeaa-a6c47ab1b543\" data-location=\"LIST\" pagelayout=\"Default - Article Page\" imagegroup=\"{\u0026#34;imageData\u0026#34;:{},\u0026#34;size\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;float\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;lightbox\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;imageDoNotCrop\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;imageDoNotResize\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;imageWatermark\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;imageParallax\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imageCrop\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imageEnlarge\u0026#34;:false}\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e  \u003ch3\u003eWhich is better: A treadmill or elliptical?\u003c/h3\u003e  \u003c/p\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"\" data-cy=\"shortcodeListicle\" data-id=\"listicle-ac4387e6-656a-4668-a10f-8d878afeb9e6\" data-location=\"LIST\" pagelayout=\"Default - Article Page\" imagegroup=\"{\u0026#34;imageData\u0026#34;:{},\u0026#34;size\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;float\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;lightbox\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;imageDoNotCrop\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;imageDoNotResize\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;imageWatermark\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;imageParallax\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imageCrop\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imageEnlarge\u0026#34;:false}\"\u003e \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e  \u003ch3\u003eHow do you lubricate a treadmill?\u003c/h3\u003e  \u003c/p\u003e \u003c/div\u003e    \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to NordicTrack, you\u0026#39;ll need to buy a nonsilicone-based treadmill lubricant from the treadmill supplier.
