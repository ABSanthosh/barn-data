  "description": "The International Civil Aviation Organization plans to eliminate boarding passes and check-ins within three years through a new \"digital travel credential\" system. Passengers will store passport data on their phones and use facial recognition to move through airports, while airlines will automatically detect arrivals via biometric scanning. The system will dynamically update \"journey passes\" for flight changes and delays, potentially streamlining connections. \"The last upgrade of great scale was the adoption of e-ticketing in the early 2000s,\" said Valerie Viale from travel technology company Amadeus, who noted passenger data will be deleted within 15 seconds at each checkpoint to address privacy concerns.
