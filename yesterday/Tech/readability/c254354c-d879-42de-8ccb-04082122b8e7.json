PLD Space launched its first, smaller rocket, Miura 1, from Spain last year. However, for a bigger orbital launcher like Miura 5, the company needs a facility with specific capabilities. These include a large launch pad, a comprehensive mission control centre, and access to a geographically optimal location for orbital trajectories.Â Â  PLD Space plans to conduct test and flight campaigns for MIURA 5 from the site. The rocketâ€™s maiden flight is scheduled for late 2025.Â  RaÃºl Torres and RaÃºl VerdÃº, university classmates, founded PLD Space in 2011 with a vision to create something akin to a European version of Elon Muskâ€™s SpaceX.

It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now! The companyâ€™s ambitions extend beyond MIURA 5. It plans to develop Miura Next,Â  a family of heavy-lift reusable rockets by the 2030s and the Lince capsule, Europeâ€™s first private manned spacecraft. Europeâ€™s space race is firing upÂ  Morgan Stanley predicts the space economy will grow from â‚¬355 billion in 2020 to over â‚¬1 trillion by 2030 â€” and competition for the rewards is fierce. The USA remains a global leader, while China is emerging as a powerful challenger. Then thereâ€™s Europe, which has historically lagged behind in the space race.Â  Against this backdrop, companies like PLD Space are seen as crucial for ensuring Europe doesnâ€™t become too dependent on foreign powers â€” and companies like SpaceX â€” for access to space. PLD Space hopes to be the flagbearer for a new era of private European spaceflight. But itâ€™s not alone. The company faces stiff competition from other startups with similar ambitions and similar timelines.Â  Two of the most promising are Rocket Factory Augsburg (RFA) and Isar Aerospace, both from Germany. These startups are developing partially reuseable, orbital launchers with a similar carrying capacity to Miura 5 â€” 1000-1500kg.Â  All three contenders are rushing to become the first private company to launch a European-built satellite launcher into orbit.Â  RFA faced a setback in August when its rocket blew up during testing, pushing back its projected launch date to 2025 at the earliest. Meanwhile, Isar Aerospace commenced hot-fire tests of its Spectrum rocket in September, but with the year almost over it looks like the companyâ€™s original 2024 launch date projection will slip away.Â  Whoever gets there first, one thingâ€™s for sure: Europeâ€™s private space race is heating up. And thatâ€™s good for the continentâ€™s celestial ambitions whichever way you slice it.",
