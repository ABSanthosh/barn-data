This year, we're on the lookout for a few futuristic gaming monitors from LG and Samsung — and more previews are sure to drop soon.LG's bendable gaming monitorsLG Electronics is set to present its new UltraGear GX9 series at CES 2025, with a lineup that includes two 45-inch 21:9 gaming monitors, the 45GX990A and 45GX950A, boasting ultra-high 5K2K resolution for immersive gameplay. With these monitors, we should expect enhanced screen real estate and better compatibility — plus customizable options through Dual-Mode, allowing users to adjust aspect ratios and picture sizes. And it's curved, which, LG says, can reduce eye strain and make gaming more comfortable. Mashable Light Speed The new UltraGear OLED Bendable Gaming Monitor is the first of its kind to feature a bendable 5K2K-resolution OLED display. LG says you can transition it from a flat screen to a 900R curvature in seconds. YS Lee, the VP and head of LG Media Entertainment’s IT Business Unit, said in a press release ahead of CES 2025 that \"the GX9 lineup pushes the boundaries to deliver maximum value and enjoyment for our customers.\"Samsung takes on AI and OLED gamingSamsung announced its new Odyssey OLED G81SF and Odyssey OLED G60SF, both of which are 27-inch 4K monitors. The Odyssey OLED G81SF has a maximum refresh rate of 240Hz, an impressive response time of 0.03ms, and a display free of glare. According to Samsung, \"The Odyssey OLED G8 (G81SF model) is the first 27” 4K (3,840 x 2,160) OLED gaming monitor in the world.\"In comparison, the Odyssey OLED G60SF is the \"first-ever OLED screen with a 500Hz refresh rate,\" Samsung says. The company will also be showcasing the Odyssey 3D G90XF gaming monitor at CES, a customizable 3D experience that doesn't require the user to wear 3D glasses.And while the Smart Monitor M90SF isn't specifically made for gaming, it does feature some industry-first on-device AI features that \"analyzes input signals to determine the type of content being viewed... and automatically adjust the display settings for the best visual experience.\" For gamers, it'll be able to fine-turn the picture settings and make the experience more immersive — but it's also being billed as a great video and productivity tool.
