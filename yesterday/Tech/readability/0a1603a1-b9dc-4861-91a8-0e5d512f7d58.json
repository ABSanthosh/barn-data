  "description": "Long-time Slashdot reader MojoKid writes: AMD took the wraps of its next gen RDNA 4 consumer graphics architecture Friday, which was designed to enhance efficiency over the previous generation, while also optimizing performance for today's more taxing ray-traced gaming and AI workloads. RDNA 4 features next generation Ray Tracing engines, dedicated hardware for AI and ML workloads, better bandwidth utilization, and multimedia improvements for both gaming and content creation. AMD's 3rd generation Ray Accelerators in RDNA offer 2x the peak throughput of RDNA 3 and add support for a new feature called Oriented Bounding Boxes, that results in more efficient GPU utilization. 3rd Generation Matrix Accelerators are also present, which offer improved performance, along with support for 8-bit float data types, with structured sparsity. The first cards featuring RDNA 4, the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT go on sale next week, with very competitive MSRPs below $600, and are expected to do battle with NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5070-class GPUs The article calls it \"a significant step forward\" for AMD, adding that next week is \"going to be very busy around here. NVIDIA is launching the final, previously announced member of the RTX 50 series and AMD will unleash the 9070 and 9070 XT.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
