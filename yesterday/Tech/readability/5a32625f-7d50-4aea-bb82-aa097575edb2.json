As part of our mission to elevate the startups shaping our future, we’ve partnered with Bounce Watch to bring its powerful analytics to our repertoire of tools. Bounce Watch is an intelligence platform for company performance — and it’s seriously impressed us. The AI-powered system tracks and analyses business activity in real-time, delivering data on over 1 million startups and tailored industry insights.  It offers instant alerts on funding rounds, leadership changes, and key business signals. Investors, scouts, and corporate innovators use the data to uncover critical trends and potential risks — before they escalate. The findings shed new light on promising startups, market shifts, emerging technologies, and investment opportunities. We’ve been wowed by the results. After getting to know Bounce Watch at demos and bonding through shared experiments, we’re taking our relationship to the next level.The 💜 of EU techThe latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now! Our new partnership gives TNW enhanced access to the platform. We’ll use Bounce Watch to gain insights on startups, founders, industries, and innovations. We’ll track numerous indicators, from product launches and stealth updates to hiring shifts and capital flows.  The data will expand our understanding of the ecosystem — and reveal early clues to the big stories before they hit the headlines. It will also improve our content, events, and scouting initiatives. We can then deliver extra insights to our entire community. The collaboration builds on ties that have already proven fruitful. How Bounce Watch and TNW came together Bounce Watch was founded in 2023 by CEO Cem Ötkün and CTO Sedat Yusuf Ergüneş. Last year, the company raised €2.5mn in pre-seed funding. TNW spotted the company’s potential at an early stage. After recognising its promise, we supported Bounce Watch’s growth in the Netherlands through our Startup Visa programme. “This partnership with TNW means a lot to us — not just professionally, but personally,” Ötkün says. “It played a role in our move to a new country through the Startup Visa, and today it marks a new chapter for Bounce Watch. We’re proud to be building alongside such a forward-thinking community.” We’re already using the platform to sharpen our startup scouting and power our new investor handbook — and we’re just getting started. Plans are now underway for co-created content, event collaborations, and new tools for our community. Ergüneş is excited about what’s ahead. “As a builder, there’s something special about seeing TNW core teams using what we’ve created — every single day,” he said. “It’s a great feeling to know that our product is helping people stay ahead, right here where innovation happens.” Our next step to discover the next big thing in tech is TNW Conference. A glittering lineup of star speakers, startups, investors, corporate innovators, and digital policymakers will come to Amsterdam on June 19-20 for the event. Want to join them? Well, we have a special offer for you — use the code TNWXMEDIA2025 at the ticket checkout to get 30% off.",
