WrestleMania 41: Don't Miss Today's Final Matches WrestleMania 41 date, start time and match card How to watch WrestleMania 41 in the US How to watch WrestleMania 41 internationally The countdown is over. The grand finale of WrestleMania 41 has arrived. After a weekend packed with jaw-jacking promos, surprise entrances and enough drama to fuel a steel cage match, WWE's biggest event is set to close out with one more night of chaos. Las Vegas is the battleground for night two, where titles, rivalries and legacies will be decided in the ring.If you're looking to catch every last suplex and spear, you're in the right place. Here's how to stream the final night of WrestleMania 41 live -- plus how a VPN can help you watch without interruption, especially if you're outside the U.S.The winners of this year's Royal Rumble matches -- Jey Uso and Charlotte Flair -- picked their opponents for the big show, with Uso setting his sights on the Ring General, Gunther, for the World Heavyweight Championship belt, and Flair challenging WWE Women's Champion Tiffany Stratton for the title. That was only the beginning of what has turned out to be a wild couple of months. John Cena won the five-person Elimination Chamber match event in March, which pitted Drew McIntyre, Seth \"Freakin'\" Rollins, Damian Priest, Logan Paul and Cena against each other, with Cena coming out the victor. Cena chose Cody Rhodes as his opponent in WrestleMania 41 and shocked the world when he turned heel at the whim of the Final Boss himself, The Rock, and assaulted Rhodes, leaving him a bloody mess in the ring. This has left everyone wondering if Cena, who is in the middle of his farewell tour, will break records and win the WWE Championship title a 17th time. Or will Rhodes maintain his dominance?There's one other huge storyline that will come to a head in the two-night wrestling extravaganza: Roman Reigns will face off against CM Punk and Seth \"Freaking\" Rollins in a Triple Threat match. Significant heat has been generated between these three, and their fight will be a must-watch. What makes this an even more impactful battle is the fact that this is Punk's first-ever time appearing in a main event match at WrestleMania, and he's cashed in a favor to have his best friend (and Roman Reigns's wise man) Paul Heyman in his corner during all of it.That sounds like a lot, yet this scratches the surface of what will surely be an event for the books.
