  "text": "io9 has covered a few notable Star Wars auctions lately, as rare toys and highly collectible props have come to market in surprisingly robust amounts. But maybe the most exciting example has just emerged: Darth Vader’s lightsaber. The actual, authentic, screen-matched hilt used by David Prowse and his stunt double in both The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. As your mind reels at the possibility of owning such a prize, consider that it’s estimated to command $1 million at the lowest estimate and $3 million at the highest… and maybe more. Propstore’s press release touting the sale notes that back in 2022, it sold a screen-matched miniature of a Star Wars X-wing fighter for over $2.3 million, but “Vader’s lightsaber has the potential to surpass that figure.” If any Star Wars prop is going to rake in that much dough, it’s gotta be this one. The press release stresses that this is the very weapon deployed in Darth Vader’s climactic battles with Luke Skywalker, used on-set by Prowse and stunt performer Bob Anderson. © Propstore Here are additional details on the piece: “It is constructed from a vintage British press camera flash handle that was transformed into Vader’s infamous weapon through the fitting of dressing components such as plastic grips, calculator bubbles, and cosmetic wiring. This specific prop was further modified with a custom blade-mounting system that facilitated the installation of a wooden rod; the rod served as the blade during the choreographed fight scenes and made the physical, on-camera dueling possible. It also later served as a guide for visual effects artists to add the hand-animated glow for the final shots.” What’s more, “this is believed to be the only hero lightsaber prop from the original Star Wars trilogy with verifiable screen use ever to be offered at public auction and is widely considered one of the most sought-after items in Star Wars collecting.” Propstore’s Entertainment Memorabilia Auction takes place this September in Los Angeles, after several of the biggest items—including Indiana Jones’ bullwhip and belt from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and Sauron’s helmet from The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring—complete a press tour to London, Beverly Hills, and New York.
