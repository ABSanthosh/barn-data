  "description": "Apple is reportedly planning to introduce a small but welcome convenience feature with iOS 19: cross-device syncing for Wi-Fi access portals. This is according to the latest Power On newsletter from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. The feature would address the annoyance of having to individually fill out pop-up forms to access public Wi-Fi on all your devices, like when you're at a hotel. According to Gurman, \"This new feature will let you enter that information on one device and have it synced to your other products.\" It's one of several upcoming features Apple may show off at its Worldwide Developers Conference, which is set for June 9-13 this year. The event is expected to bring some major design changes to the company's operating systems that should make for a more consistent look between its products' software. Gurman also reports that AirPods may be getting a live translation feature, which we could see at WWDC alongside a revamped Health app. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-19-may-bring-a-feature-that-makes-signing-into-public-wi-fi-less-of-a-hassle-210435303.html?src=rss",
