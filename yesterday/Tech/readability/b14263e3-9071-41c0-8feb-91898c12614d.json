  "text": "Marvel's newest movie is full of red, white and blue action. Kourtnee covers TV streaming services and home entertainment news and reviews at CNET. She previously worked as an entertainment reporter at Showbiz Cheat Sheet where she wrote about film, television, music, celebrities, and streaming platforms. Expertise Cord-cutting, TV and music streaming services Netflix, Disney Plus, Max, Anime, Interviews, Entertainment CredentialsThough Kourtnee hasn't won any journalism awards yet, she's been a Netflix streaming subscriber since 2012 and knows the magic of its hidden codes. Marvel's Captain America: Brave New World marks the big-screen jump for Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson taking center stage with the shield. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier laid the foundation for the new film, and the last time we saw the hero he'd uncovered a plot about a super serum, made nice with bestie Bucky Barnes and fought off a group called the Flag Smashers. Brave New World introduces Harrison Ford as President Thaddeus Ross and sees Sam caught up in a foreign relations debacle while investigating a deeper, more sinister scheme with devastating effects. We know you've seen the trailer and at this point, may have already seen or plan to see the film. Marvel is known to drop scenes after the credits start rolling, and, to answer the question, yes, there is a single post-credits scene in Brave New World, and you must wait until all the credits are over to see it, and you can expect some teases with this vibranium-clad Captain America, too. If you haven't seen the movie, pause here. Spoilers ahead.Read more: The Hottest Movie Releases Coming in 2025 Marvel StudiosCaptain America: Brave New World post-credits sceneUnlike many Marvel movies, Brave New World has no mid-credit scenes; there's only one post-credits scene, and you have to wait until the absolute end to see it. So, what happens?After the brainiac villain Samuel Sterns turns himself in to ignite President Ross's inner Red Hulk, we don't see him for the rest of the film. Sam has a short conversation with Sterns in which he confidently tells him he will foil his plot. Then, Sam struts off as armed guards surround Sterns. The scientist is arrested and carted off to a cell in parts unknown while Sam suits up to fight Red Hulk Ross. In the minute-long post-credits scene, Sam walks up to a cell and says, \"Told you you were gonna lose that bet,\" and we see Sterns sitting inside. They trade barbs, and then Sterns points out that they \"share the same world, don't we? This world you would die to save.\" He ominously warns Sam, \"It's coming. I've seen it in the probabilities.\" Sterns goes on to say that superheroes who are protecting this world think they're the only ones -- and believe this is the only world. With more menacing snark, he says you'll see what happens when you need to protect everyone from \"the others.\" Marvel StudiosWhat could it mean?One thing to keep in mind here: We are still in the middle of Marvel's Multiverse Saga. That likely won't wrap up until Avengers: Secret Wars hits screens in 2027, so that means more Avengers, more timeline dizziness and more comic book storylines that involve interdimensional and intergalactic beings. Now, I could get into Thunderbolts stuff here because that movie is next in line, but I want to talk about the Avengers. Sterns' gamma-powered superintelligence allows him to see things with high levels of intuition, statistical probability and knowledge. With Avengers: Doomsday and Secret Wars in the pipeline, he may be hinting at the future appearance of beings called the Beyonders. I don't know this for sure, but in the comics, they sit on the fringes of the Multiverse outside of its scope. Like the Eternals, the Beyonders were created by the Celestials, and they have an appetite for destroying things. Think of Thanos' attitude of, \"Let me wipe out the whole wack universe,\" but on a multiverse level. Not only is their story deeply connected to Doctor Doom, but they also have comic book ties to the High Evolutionary, Guardians of the Galaxy and the Fantastic Four's Reed Richards. If this is the group of \"others\" Sterns is alluding to (and perhaps the Molecule Men), fans should expect the next set of Marvel's Avengers movies to be a war for the survival of the multiverse -- and all the Avengers. Captain America: Brave New World is in theaters now, and the credits also let us know that he'll be back.  Other Services \u0026 Software",
