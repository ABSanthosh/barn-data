Computer-controlled hydrofoils lift the P-12 above water, reducing drag and cutting energy use by 80% compared to regular boats. This also provides a smooth, silent ride unaffected by waves and winds.  Attracting over 15 million visitors annually, Lake Tahoe suffers from road congestion, worsened in winter by heavy snow and road closures. However, since the lake never freezes over, the P-12 can operate year-round, providing a quicker, cleaner alternative to driving.  Last month, Stockholm became the first city to adopt Candela’s ferry as part of its public transport system. The P-12 runs a 15km route from the suburb of Ekerö into the City centre, cutting a 55-minute commute in half.  Candela estimates 120 of its shuttles could replace Stockholm’s entire 35-strong fleet of diesel ferries. At $1.7mn (€1.5mn) a piece, that’s a big investment, but CEO Gustav Hasselskog is bullish on the returns.  “Unlike a lot of green technologies, the cost is lower, it’s cheaper to run, and cheaper to maintain,” he told TNW when we visited the company’s headquarters earlier this year.  Powered by a fresh batch of funding, Candela’s is rushing to fulfil orders from New Zealand, Berlin, Saudi Arabia and now the US, as it prepares for its biggest phase of growth yet.  “Our technology offers a strong economic incentive to switch to zero-emission fleets while unlocking the potential for waterways to ease road congestion and enable multi-modal urban travel. This investment comes at a critical time for the planet,” said Hasselskog in a press release. SEB Private Equity, a global private equity investor, led the funding round, with participation from existing investors EQT Ventures and KanDela AB.",
