American and Asian manufacturers now dominate the industry. But Europe‚Äôs old mobile guard isn‚Äôt finished yet. The continent‚Äôs phone makers are still finding new routes into the market. One of them stems from the resurgence of dumbphones. A reminder of simpler times, the basic bricks offer a digital detox and an escape from relentless data harvesting. A range of new versions have recently been launched. Older ones are also enjoying comebacks ‚Äî including the legendary 3310. Hackaday recently spotlighted a technique that revitalises the classic handset: installing a USB-C socket. The mod is the brainchild of Andrea Salvadori, a developer based in Italy. Salvadori adds the USB-C port by integrating a small adapter into the phone. He‚Äôs selling the parts online for ‚Ç¨25. My beloved 3310 would have cherished the upgrade, but the old device is sadly no longer with me. Thankfully, a host of modern dumbphones are now available.

An impressive number of them are built by European companies. Among them are the Nokia 2660 Flip, the Swiss-made Punkt MP02, and the 6820 from Swedish firm Doro. Europe may have lagged behind in the smartphone era, but the continent is now leading the dumbphone revival.",
