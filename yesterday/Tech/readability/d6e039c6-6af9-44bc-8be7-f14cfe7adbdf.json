Just manage your expectations — this isn't a get-rich-quick type of opportunity.GameStop has been a savior recently. For many of us, the gaming-centric retailer was a means to snag the coveted Nintendo Switch 2. They also gave the best trade-in offer for those of us who were ready to part with the older console to make room for the new one. But, according to the plaintiffs of the class-action lawsuit Aldana v. GameStop, Inc., the company may have done some customers dirty. And thanks to a settlement in the case, GameStop customers can now claim some payback from the company.If you bought a game online at GameStop between Aug. 18, 2020 and April 17, 2025 and you have an active Facebook profile (and did so at the time of purchase) that uses your real name, you might entitled to some cash back. If you're eligible for a payout from the lawsuit, you get to choose between a $5 cash payment or a voucher for $10 to use at GameStop's website. To get either of these benefits, you'll need to submit a claim form by Aug. 15. How to file your claimIf you're eligible for the settlement offer, you should have received an email with details of how to file your claim. The email is titled \"Aldana v. GameStop - Notice of Proposed Class Action Settlement,\" in case it ended up your spam folder. So, if you're wondering if the GameStop settlement email is legit, it is.To file your claim, you'll need to head to the class-action lawsuits official webpage. From there, you'll need to scroll to the bottom and hit \"Start Your Claim.\" Enter your personal details, including the Unique ID that's listed in the email notice. If you didn't get an email notice, but you think you're eligible, you'll need to fill out a paper claim form and mail it to the listed address. Otherwise, follow the online form to enter in your name, address, and proof of your Facebook account. You can do this by either providing your account's URL or uploading a screenshot. Mashable Top Stories If you opt for the cash payment, you'll be prompted to provide your Venmo username, PayPal email address, or Zelle email address.If you go the GameStop voucher route, it'll be sent to the GameStop account associated with the email you listed on the claim form. Remember: you must file this claim by Aug. 15.While $5 of cash or a $10 GameStop credit won't get you far these days, free money is free money, so there's really no downside to filing your claim. And hey, a $10 GameStop voucher will take some of the sting out of that $80 Mario Kart World purchase.The gritty detailsThe lawsuit, brought about by Alejandro Aldana and Scott Gallie, claims GameStop wrongfully gave Facebook information about its online customers without their consent. GameStop claims they've done no wrong, but has agreed to settle the class-action lawsuit in the sum of $4.5 million. Companies often do this to avoid a (more) costly legal process. In case you're interested in the fine print, here's how this all went down: The lawsuit says GameStop gave personally identifiable information (PII) of online customers to Facebook via the Facebook Tracking Pixel without the consent of these customers. If that did actually happen, it would be in violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA). This law was passed way back in 1988 and forbids companies like GameStop from disclosing PPI without consent. (That's the year that Crocodile Dundee II came out, for reference.) The law mostly talks about information from video rental and purchase history, but the language makes it still applicable to today's world of video game purchases. The final step of this settlement is set to take place in a fairness hearing on Sept. 18 at the Supreme Court of the State of New York. There, the court will hear any objections and determine the fairness of the case. The settlement GameStop agreed to also requires the company to stop using the Facebook Tracking Pixel on any page of its website that could capture information that would violate the VPPA, according to Top Class Actions. If you feel like doing a deep dive, you can read the entire 56-page settlement here. You can also check out an FAQ. Lauren Allain is a freelance journalist covering deals at Mashable.
