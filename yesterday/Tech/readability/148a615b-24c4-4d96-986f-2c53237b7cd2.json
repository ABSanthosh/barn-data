  "text": "Smart heaters produced by Govee and GoveeLife were voluntarily recalled this week due to testing that revealed some models can overheat, potentially causing fires or burns. This affects over 500,000 units in the United States and Canada. Multiple models are included in the recall, most of which came to market in the last year. Affected models: H7130 (including the H7130101 variation)H7131H7132H7133H7134H7135You can locate the model number on the bottom of your Govee smart heater on the UL label. If your model is one of the affected ones, you can receive a refund—you do not need to return the unit, but will need proof of destruction (a picture of the heater cord cut) for the refund process. It doesn't matter if the product is already out of warranty. Once the cord is cut, it should be thrown out or recycled (do not upcycle it or donate it; it is a fire hazard for whoever adopts it, too). During the refund process, you will be asked for your personal information and order information. You can find additional tips for locating your order number on the recall advisory page here. If you need additional help or have questions, you can reach out to Govee directly.I tested and reviewed two of these heaters over the last year, and while the tower heater inspired some critical comments about the design, I have used and enjoyed the smaller Smart Heater Lite for the last year and will be sorry to see it go. But go it must.",
