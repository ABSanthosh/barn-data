  "text": "If the upcoming movies based on Lego, Matchbox, and other childhood toys weren’t enough for you, next up is… a Toys ‘R’ Us movie? Yes, really. Per Variety, the toy store chain is coming to the silver screen, courtesy of Story Kitchen, the studio behind several recent game adaptations. The apparent idea here is to make something in the vein of Night at the Museum and Big, and other recent toy-related hits like Barbie. At the moment, the film is in early development, but producers Dmitri M. Johnson \u0026 Mike Goldberg are already talking with filmmakers about the project. Johnson and Goldberg, who co-founded Story Kitchen, called Toys ‘R’ Us “a cultural touchstone that continues impacting the child in all of us today. As ‘80s kids who considered the store one of the most magical places on Earth, we’re honored to partner to create a film that will capture the spirit of adventure, creativity and nostalgia it represents.” “This project is an exciting opportunity to bring the magic of our brand to the big screen,” added Toys ‘R’ Us Studios president Kim Miller Olko. “The movie will be a journey as boundless as play itself, evoking the electric sense of wonder that is the essence of Toys ‘R’ Us. This story will capture the imagination, adventure and joy that has made Toys ‘R’ Us a destination for kids of all ages.” Toys ‘R’ Us was founded in 1948 and for generations of kids was one of the coolest places ever. Those stores were big and felt like they had everything, and it didn’t hurt they had Geoffrey the Giraffe as a mascot and a catchy TV jingle. Over the years, online stores and mass merchants grew in popularity, and private equity loans put the company in significant debt. It went defunct in 2018, only to be revived in 2021—mainly as a subsection of Macy’s, but there are some standalone stores in New Jersey and Minnesota’s Mall of America. We’ll probably have more on the Toys ‘R’ Us movie as it develops, including whether there are plans to do a Babies ‘R’ Us spinoff. Want more io9 news?
