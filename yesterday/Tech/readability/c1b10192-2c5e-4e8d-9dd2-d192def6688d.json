  "description": "\"The U.K is looking to build a homegrown challenger to OpenAI and drastically increase national computing infrastructure,\" reports CNBC, \"as Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government sets its sights on becoming a global leader in artificial intelligence.\" The government is primarily seeking to expand data center capacity across the U.K. to boost developers of powerful AI models which rely on high-performance computing equipment hosted in remote locations to train and run their systems. A target of increasing \"sovereign,\" or public sector, compute capacity in the U.K. by twentyfold by 2030 has been set... To further bolster Britain's computing infrastructure, the government also committed to setting up several AI \"growth zones,\" where rules on planning permission will be relaxed in certain places to allow for the creation of new data centers. Meanwhile, an \"AI Energy Council\" formed of industry leaders from both energy and AI will be set up to explore the role of renewable and low-carbon sources of energy, like nuclear... Britain plans to use the AI growth zones and a newly established National Data Library to connect public institutions — such as universities — to enhance the country's ability to create \"sovereign\" AI models which aren't reliant on Silicon Valley... Last month, the government announced a consultation on measures to regulate the use of copyrighted content to train AI models. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
