Credit: Amazon If you're ready to upgrade from tracking your steps to something more performance-driven, investing in a running watch might be your best move. The Garmin Forerunner 255 running watch is designed to help runners optimize training and improve performance, and right now, it’s 43% off on Amazon, the lowest price it’s ever reached according to price trackers. With GPS tracking, comprehensive stats, free training plans, and training evaluations to monitor performance and provide feedback, it’s like a built-in running coach for your wrist. This discounted model has a larger 46mm screen (compared to the 41mm version) and is the non-music edition, meaning it doesn’t store or play music, so you’ll still need your phone for playlists. It lasts up to 14 days in smartwatch mode and 30 hours in GPS mode, with accurate tracking via multiple satellite systems. At just 1.7 ounces, it’s lightweight despite its size, and features a sweat-resistant silicone band and Corning Gorilla Glass 3. The button-based interface (rather than a touchscreen) may also appeal to runners who want reliable control during a sweaty workout.The built-in Garmin Coach feature offers free adaptive training plans for 5K, 10K, and half-marathon distances. You can also create custom workouts via the Garmin Connect app. The watch provides training tips and personalized workout suggestions that adapt based on your post-run performance and recovery, tracking heart rate and using SatIQ technology to balance GPS accuracy with battery life. It even evaluates your current routine to help you avoid under-training or overexertion.When worn overnight, HRV status can track your heart rate during sleep and provide additional insight into your overall wellness. However, given the slightly bulky nature of the watch, it may not be comfortable for some people to sleep with. While it's a favorite among runners, many Amazon reviewers also highlight its accuracy for open water and pool swims, making it a versatile watch for different kinds of fitness lovers. What do you think so far? While it’s ideal for runs and everyday use, its stainless steel casing isn’t as rugged as Garmin’s Fenix or Instinct series, and if you want built-in music, you may want to splurge on the brand’s upgraded model instead. If you don’t need those premium features, the Garmin Forerunner 255 running watch offers solid value with GPS accuracy, in-depth training insights, and a long battery life for runners who want to train smart without overspending.  Add to Cart Shop smarter, save more money Daniel Oropeza Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.
