  "text": "Spring break continues at theme parks and fandom experiences around the country. This past week saw the opening of Star Wars Season of the Force at the Disneyland Resort. io9 was on hand to experience the food and fun there. Here we catch up with the rest of the galactic goods with a look at Shadows of Memory: A Skywalker Saga, the nighttime spectacular over the skies of the Black Spire Outpost at Disneyland (sorry, none for you, Galaxy’s Edge East Coast). Then there’s the latest in fandom merch and accessorizing at the parks with Pop Mart and Hello Kitty. Movie fans are eating well figuratively and literally at AREA15’s John Wick Experience and a series of curated cinematic cuisine at Las Vegas’ immersive hub with Fork n’ Film. Read on for all this and more in this week’s theme park news. Padmé and Anakin’s forbidden love shines in new Galaxy’s Edge show This sweeping moment of Padmé and Anakin’s forbidden love stood out the most because it’s their romance which leads to the Skywalker lineage of heroes and villains. It’s rare to see their romance given its proper due and felt like the heart of the new Galaxy’s Edge iteration of the fireworks and projections on the spires and Millennium Falcon in Shadows of Memory: A Skywalker Saga.  Mouse Droid coming to Galaxy’s Edge Droid Depot This is not a popcorn bucket version you’re familiar with, it’s the latest droid release coming to Disneyland’s Galaxy’s Edge. The 1:1 mouse droid replica will be a featured merch drop during Season of the Force at the Disneyland Resort. We got a look at it during the media preview but did not receive confirmation on price or date it will be released from reps at the demonstration. A Goofy Movie’s Powerline popcorn bucket gets a park-wide drop The voice of Goofy, Bill Farmer, was on hand to celebrate the news that the Powerline popcorn bucket will now be available park-wide at the Disneyland resort. Pop Mart’s Disney drops are theme park must-haves © Pop Mart Pop Mart’s Mickey Cute family keychains are a hot commodity; they’re the latest theme park trend that Disney fans are lining up to buy and accessorize with on Disney trips. We saw so many at Disneyland only this past week. The blind box brand has featured a number of gorgeously designed art figures with expressive and exciting features for Disney properties which are available at retailers and online, such as the Star Wars series and the Disney Princess Ride collection. Park-goers are clamoring for more drops of the coveted Mickey Cute Family blind box keychains which are priming up to be their Disney version of their global Labubu craze done in a similar style. They sell out very quickly online and create queues at Pop Mart brick and mortars around the world. At least for Disney fans—I’ve never seen a line they weren’t willing to stand in. Opening dates for new Walt Disney World shows revealed Starting on May 27 you will be able to watch The Little Mermaid – A Musical Adventure and Disney Villains: Unfairly Ever After at Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World. It will be a fun and musical way to stay out of the Florida summer heat and humidity as you’re chillin’ like a villain. Blaster updates coming to Buzz Lightyear’s Space Ranger Spin  The Magic Kingdom’s Toy Story attraction is getting a much needed refresh. The original blasters on this laser point and shoot ride used to be fused to the ride vehicles, which was such a surprise for me as a Disneyland local when I visited for the first time. The West Coast version of the ride allows for more mobility by using a cord. Now, fans of the attraction at Walt Disney World will get a better redesign on the game aspect of the ride to rack up those points. Don’t forget targets are worth more when they’re lit. Hello Kitty and Tile collaborate for this travel essential Theme park stress be gone when it comes to adding these cute Hello Kitty tracker Tiles to your bags or strollers. This limited edition drop from the Tile brand, which I’ve used myself, help park goers breathe a sigh of relief when parking their belongings outside attractions or while meeting Hello Kitty during meet and greets. The fear of forgetting your bag when putting it down for a photo gets lessened with this extra added sense of security. For more info on the collab visit Tile online. Sanrio Hello Kitty x Universal Movies at Universal Studios Hello Kitty crosses over into more Universal Studios properties with expanded releases that put the iconic character in the worlds of Back to the Future, Jaws, Psycho, and more. Find them at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Orlando. Focus Features hosts Pride \u0026 Prejudice Ball Focus Features is hosting an official ball in honor of the 2005 Pride \u0026 Prejudice movie’s 20th anniversary. The film starring Keira Knightly and Matthew Macfadyen unleashed ship culture as we know it, at least online because we all know that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy have been that It Couple since Jane Austen published that book in 1813. Dress to impress and to yearn longingily. For more info on tickets visit here. AREA15 John Wick and Fork n’ Film Immersive Cinema The John Wick Experience, an ARG mission into the assassin world of the films starring Keanu Reeves, is now open. Here you can live out a roleplay immersion as you enter the iconic Continental Hotel in Las Vegas’ AREA15. For more info visit here. For more family-friendly fare in Vegas, you and your loved ones can partake in immersive dining experiences inspired by Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and Monsters Inc with Fork n’ Film bookings.
