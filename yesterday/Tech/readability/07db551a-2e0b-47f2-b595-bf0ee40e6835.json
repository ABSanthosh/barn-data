Read Full Bio  on April 28, 2025 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Flipboard ChatGPT will link to retailers but won't earn a commission, at least for now. Credit: VCG / Getty Images As of Monday, April 28, OpenAI is experimenting with new ways to recommend products to ChatGPT users.OpenAI announced the update on Monday, saying the ChatGPT search tool will now make it \"simpler and faster to find, compare, and buy products in ChatGPT.\" In a post on X, OpenAI said that the AI chatbot can now show product images, comparisons, pricing, reviews, and even a direct link to various retailers. This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed. Mashable was able to generate the new features using the ChatGPT 4o model. The new \"shopping improvements\" make ChatGPT a stronger competitor to Google's search product, which searchers often use to find product recommendations. However, while Google's search results generate almost instantly, ChatGPT's shopping recommendations took up to 40 seconds to generate. In addition, the experimental feature often linked to questionable, little-known retailers in Mashable's tests.The new search features for ChatGPT rolled out today to Plus, Pro, and free users, even those who aren't logged into an account. We saw a similar response when searching for \"best espresso machines\" on ChatGPT. (AI generated image) Credit: OpenAI So, how does ChatGPT select the products to show users? Mashable Light Speed OpenAI explicitly said that the included products are not sponsored. OpenAI spokesperson Taya Christianson also told Mashable that OpenAI doesn't earn any commission from links to merchant sites. Adam Fry, OpenAI's product lead for ChatGPT search, told Wired that “it’s not looking for specific signals that are in some algorithm.\" Instead, it's focused on how people are talking about certain products and is designed to be more conversational. OpenAI says the new features are being tested with fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics. If OpenAI's introduction of ChatGPT search was an act of aggression towards Google, then the new shopping features are a major escalation. A recent Future survey found that people are increasingly using chatbots like ChatGPT over traditional search engines. At the same time, Google users are increasingly frustrated by the low quality of search results and the influx of AI-generated responses. In addition to these issues, Google may soon be forced to sell its Chrome web browser. Oh, and OpenAI would totally buy Chrome, if Google has to sell it, of course.ChatGPT search saw one billion web searches just last week, said Christianson, who noted that it's become one of the company's fastest-growing features.Disclosure: Ziff Davis, Mashable’s parent company, in April filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.
