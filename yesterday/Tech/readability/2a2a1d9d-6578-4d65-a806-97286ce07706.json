Over 360 startups applied. Based on the success of the first edition, NN Group and Rubio Impact Ventures will be hosting a second edition of the NN Social Innovation Startup Award at TNW2025 on June 19, 2025 in Amsterdam. The winning startups will receive a grant and year-long coaching opportunities—with tailored resources, networking, and support (Psst the application deadline is April 30th, so apply now!). Bringing our world together with tech-driven social impact “I truly believe that social innovation could be our new strategic asset,” explains Tamara Obradov, partner at Rubio Impact Ventures and one of the program’s architects. “It’s a critical pillar alongside the green and digital transitions. We first had the digital transition, then the green transition and now, to bring this polarized-world together, we need the social innovators and system shapers.” Over the last decade, climate-tech solutions have received attention from VCs thanks to the Green Deal and national efforts to curb climate change by providing incentives and drivers for change. Alongside this, grew the realization that sustainability is not only good for the planet but also good for business, providing cost-saving alternatives. However, social impact solutions have not received the same level of attention from VCs. “People often associate impact with climate,” says Obradov. “But rarely do we talk about how we help people transition toward the future. That’s where social innovation comes in. We need to invest in climate and food systems—but we also need to help society adapt.” Today, it’s estimated that more than 84 million people in the EU are struggling with mental health problems. Many businesses received a wake-up call during the pandemic which fostered the rise in mental health-focused apps but, the number of people suffering from mental health issues is increasing and, not just amongst workers, but youth and the elderly as well. Lonneke Roza, Head of Community Investment at NN Group, believes: “If we were to focus on building a world where technology helps underserved communities gain access to technological solutions that can provide life-changing physical, mental, and financial support, we could not only unlock potential for individuals but society as a whole.” Ensuring everyone is heard Assistive technology company Whispp was one of the three grant winners from the first edition of the NN Social Innovation Startup Award. CEO Joris Casterman’s drive to found the company was rooted in the challenges he faced growing up with a severe stutter. With Whispp, he developed an assistive voice call app that uses AI to convert whispered speech and vocal cord impaired speech. Participating in the award was a game-changer helping Castermans meet more like-minded VCs and benefit from a year of coaching opportunities. “I met a lot of impact investors, in addition to Rubio, who I’m still in contact with. What you see is that, along with questions about your revenue and growth model, you also get questions about how you measure your impact.” This made it clear to Castermans that, for these VCs, impact was just as important as profit. In addition to more funding opportunities, the coaching his team received was invaluable. “We had great sparring sessions on our strategy and even worked with a coach to develop our management team’s collaboration and leadership goals,” Castermans says. “We couldn’t have done that on our own—it helped us professionalize and prepare for our next phase.” This year, Whispp is set to launch two powerful new features: A virtual microphone for video conferencing, enabling people with voice impairments to be heard clearly in online meetings; A live conversation mode designed to work in noisy or crowded environments—facilitating spontaneous, in-person communication. These tools will ensure everyone’s ideas are heard. Everyone can be part of special moments with their loved ones. And everyone’s voice is heard. It’s a powerful example of how technology can create life-changing impact. Inspired by the community he’s found through the NN Social Innovation Startup Award, Castermans sees even greater potential on the horizon. “There are several really interesting accessibility companies. We could build an accessibility subgroup or coalition. This could also become a source for the world to find cool and innovative solutions in the assistive technology domain. The risk of being a startup is that you often do your own thing. But there are so many instances in which you should collaborate and team up!” A chance for VCs and corporates to scale impact Last year, a fundraising wall and booklet were created exhibiting the top 100 impact startups that took part. It was made to be easily accessible allowing VCs to sort startups by theme, country, phase, etc. “Any investor that wants to participate is more than welcome to reach out to us,” Obradov says. And for corporates? While many have the vision and the resources to drive social innovation, what they often lack is access to startups. But together, corporates and VCs can build a powerful initiative. “NN Group’s partnership with Rubio is a great example. Each brings their strength—corporates with their themes and reach, VCs with their innovation pipeline. I would like to invite more corporates to join up with venture capital firms and see how they can support innovation at scale.” Putting the social back in social impact Our biggest social challenges won’t be solved by one startup, one investor, or one institution. It requires collective effort. “I absolutely believe this could be what brings this fractured world together. And these innovators could be these agents of unity for people and society to transition to a new future,” says Obradov. Ready to be part of the future of impact innovation?
