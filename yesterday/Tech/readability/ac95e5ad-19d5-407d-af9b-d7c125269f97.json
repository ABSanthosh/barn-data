  "text": "Credit: Studio Romantic/Shutterstock It’s been a minute since Lifehacker looked at the slang of Generation Z—long enough that Generation Alpha has had time to develop and spread some of its own special buzzwords and jargon. Below is an alphabetized collection of slang taken from both Gen Z and Gen A, in case someone younger than you says something you don't understand. As with all slang, if you need an online list to know what a word means, you are too old to say it aloud. 304: Hoe. (Type \"304\" on a calculator and turn it upside down.)4+4: Ate. Four plus four is eight, or \"ate.\" (See \"ate\")Alpha male: Taken from animal ethology, an alpha male is the dominant member of a group of males, or just a male who is in charge. (See \"beta male\" and \"sigma male.\")Ate/eat: Done very well, often regarding clothing. e.g.: \"You ate that outfit.\" See also: \"serving.\" Aura: Someone who is mysterious and cool is said to \"have aura.\"Baddie: A bad/wild girl. Meant as a compliment. Baka: Japanese word meaning “crazy\" or “foolish.” Used mainly in the anime community.Based: Independent in a cool way. Bed-rotting: Staying in bed all day.
