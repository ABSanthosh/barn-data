  "text": "Much has been said of Lucasfilm’s shock decision to cancel The Acolyte earlier this year, but the studio itself, keen to move on to what’s next (and what’s further beyond that), has stayed very quiet about the specific backlash the series’ cast and crew endured as the show rolled out—even as that cast has slowly begun to address it themselves. The latest among Acolyte‘s stars to discuss the more vitriolic reaction to the series is Lee Jung-Jae, who played misguided Jedi Master Sol on the show. Frequently a high point among even for the show’s detractors, Lee (who is preparing to return to the role that made him a star in the West later this month on Netflix, when Squid Game returns for a second season) was, just like several of the other cast members on The Acolyte, occasionally subject to racist harassment for his part in the Star Wars galaxy. “My feelings were hurt,” Lee recently told Vanity Fair about The Acolyte‘s cancelation. “Especially for Leslye Headland—her feelings must have hurt a lot.” The actor added that he was “shocked” at the specifically racial undertone to some of the backlash to the series, which was focused in particular on Amandla Stenberg’s portrayal of Osha and Mae, the twins at the heart of the series. “I can only have faith that racism will end someday, even though it’s going to be hard,” Lee continued. “For some work, it takes time to gain traction, and I have strong hopes that people will like it as time passes.” But in spite of The Acolyte‘s cancelation (and Lucasfilm’s silence on both the series and the treatment of its cast and crew), Lee himself is hopeful in the face of the negative reaction .“As long as I am thankful, all things will work out,” Lee concluded. “Fandom comes along with my career. This is the nature of it, so I can’t take it for granted. No matter what, I’m always thankful.” Want more io9 news?
