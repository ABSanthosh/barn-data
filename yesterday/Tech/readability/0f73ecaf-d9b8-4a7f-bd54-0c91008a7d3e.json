  "text": "Summer is drawing closer, and things are about to heat up. For Marvel, the warm weather is as good a time as any to provide a blast from the past: the return of its cheeky Swimsuit Special. In the early to mid-’90s, Marvel would release these one-shots from various creative teams that would show the heroes hanging out and soaking up the sun. This new version—officially titled Marvel Swimsuit Special: Friends, Foes, \u0026 Rivals—marks its first return in 30 years. Why bring it back? Well, it probably has something to do with DC’s recent streak of summer variants and a little thing by the name of Marvel Rivals, which is giving swimsuit skins to some of its heroes during its current second season. The comic will feature designs from the game, so if you’re a fan of someone’s look in one medium, you might be as big (or more) of one in the other. © Adam Hughes/Marvel © Taurin Clarke/Marvel © Russell Dauterman/Marvel © Mark Brooks/Marvel For those who read it for the plot, the setup that the Avengers learn Roxxon has put out an unauthorized swimsuit special, so they decide to fight fire with swimsuits and do one of their own. Tim Seeley and Tony Fleecs are on writing duties and Nick Bradshaw’s on art for the overarching story, and the swimsuit designs will be handled by the likes of Nic Klein, Marguerite Sauvage, Luciano Vecchio, and more. Marvel Swimsuit Special: Friends, Foes, \u0026 Rivals hits stores on July 9. Want more io9 news?
