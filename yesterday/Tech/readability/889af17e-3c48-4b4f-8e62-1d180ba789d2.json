  "description": "MojoKid writes: Intel has lifted the embargo on independent reviews of its new Core Ultra 200S series Arrow Lake-S processors, which mark a shift in its desktop CPU strategy with symmetrical core/thread counts (no Hyperthreading) and a dedicated 13 TOPS NPU. This series features a disaggregated tiled design for the first time in Intel's desktop chips, focusing on efficiency and power reduction. The Core Ultra 5 245, priced around $300, and the Ultra 9 285K at $589 deliver strong performance, particularly in creator workloads, competing well with AMD's Ryzen CPUs, while the Ultra 9 285K's price undercuts AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X significantly. While gaming performance shows slight regression in spots, the new chips are much more power-efficient than their predecessors. Overall, the platform offers leading-edge features, competitive pricing, and solid performance for creators, gamers and workstation pros. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
