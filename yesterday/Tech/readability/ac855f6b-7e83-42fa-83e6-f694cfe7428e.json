The new approach to coding at many companies has, in effect, eliminated much of the time the developer spends reflecting on his or her work.\" And Amazon CEO Andy Jassy even recently told shareholders Amazon would \"change the norms\" for programming by how they used AI. Those changing norms have not always been eagerly embraced. Three Amazon engineers said managers had increasingly pushed them to use AI in their work over the past year. The engineers said the company had raised output goals [which affect performance reviews] and had become less forgiving about deadlines. It has even encouraged coders to gin up new AI productivity tools at an upcoming hackathon, an internal coding competition. One Amazon engineer said his team was roughly half the size it was last year, but it was expected to produce roughly the same amount of code by using AI. Other tech companies are moving in the same direction. In a memo to employees in April, the CEO of Shopify, a company that helps entrepreneurs build and manage e-commerce websites, announced that \"AI usage is now a baseline expectation\" and that the company would \"add AI usage questions\" to performance reviews. Google recently told employees that it would soon hold a companywide hackathon in which one category would be creating AI tools that could \"enhance their overall daily productivity,\" according to an internal announcement. Winning teams will receive $10,000. The shift has not been all negative for workers. At Amazon and other companies, managers argue that AI can relieve employees of tedious tasks and enable them to perform more interesting work. Jassy wrote last year that the company had saved \"the equivalent of 4,500 developer-years\" by using AI to do the thankless work of upgrading old software... As at Microsoft, many Amazon engineers use an AI assistant that suggests lines of code. But the company has more recently rolled out AI tools that can generate large portions of a program on its own. One engineer called the tools \"scarily good.\" The engineers said that many colleagues have been reluctant to use these new tools because they require a lot of double-checking and because the engineers want more control. \"It's more fun to write code than to read code,\" said Simon Willison, an AI fan who is a longtime programmer and blogger, channelling the objections of other programmers. \"If you're told you have to do a code review, it's never a fun part of the job. When you're working with these tools, it's most of the job.\" \"This shift from writing to reading code can make engineers feel like bystanders in their own jobs,\" the article points out (adding \"The automation of coding has special resonance for Amazon engineers, who have watched their blue-collar counterparts undergo a similar transition...\" \"While there is no rush to form a union for coders at Amazon, such a move would not be unheard of.
