Whether you’re asking a question about something you’ve already discussed, or asking Gemini to summarize a previous conversation, Gemini now uses information from relevant chats to craft a response.That means no more starting over from scratch or having to search for a previous conversation thread. Plus, you can build on top of previous conversations or projects you’ve already started.You’re in control over what information is stored. You can easily review, delete or decide how long to keep your chat history. You can also turn off Gemini Apps Activity altogether by going to My Activity. Gemini may indicate when it uses your past chats in sources and related content.This feature is starting to roll out in English for Gemini Advanced subscribers via Google One AI Premium Plan on the Gemini web and mobile app. We\u0026#x27;ll be rolling out to more languages and to our Google Workspace Business and Enterprise customers over the coming weeks.",
