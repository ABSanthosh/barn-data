  "text": "Dads often catch flak for corny jokes and being bad at texting, but father figures have another thing in common besides thinking terrible puns are hilarious: They're some of the most selfless people in the world.To be honest, a lot of us wouldn't know how to live on our own if it wasn't for those father figures — this goes for uncles, stepdads, or anyone else who stepped up to take on that role, too. And though they probably insist that you don't have to get them anything, Father's Day is an extra-special time to show your appreciation. That said, you can’t just phone it in and get him a mug that says \"Dad.\" Sure, it's technically a gift for a dad — but it's also a terrible gift. No shame if you’ve done it before; dads can be notoriously tough to shop for, we know. But we can do way better than that this Father's Day!That’s why we have you covered with awesome gift ideas for all kinds of guys, from the practical to the eclectic. (We can even help you out if you’re working with a tight budget thanks to this roundup of the best gifts under $50.) And, right here, we’ve rounded up dozens of the best gifts you can give your dad, whether he’s a grilling aficionado, an outdoor adventurer, a tech geek, or the chill kind of dad who just wants to kick back with a cold one and enjoy this fine June day dedicated to him.From practical gadgets that make his life easier to sentimental keepsakes that tug on the heartstrings of even the most “tough guy” dads, you’re bound to find the best Father’s Day gift for your dad below. Contour gauge tool For dads who like to DIY No corner is too tight, no molding too complicated for the dad in possession of this handy, oh-so-smart gauge we've been seeing all over Instagram. Great for everything from woodworking to carpentry (and a host of other home repair situations), it to accurately measure an irregular surface and help alleviate the headache that often accompanies this kind of DIY work. SPONSORED Ghost Golf apparel and gear For sporty dads If your dad's idea of a perfect day involves hitting the links or working on his short game, then a golf-related gift is a must. Ghost Golf carries a range of gloves, apparel, and other gear well-suited for the green. A sous vide machine For meat-eating dads If he's constantly bragging about how bomb his steaks are, it's time to give him a new method to conquer. Sous vide is said to prevent overcooking and enhance flavor by sealing the juices in the bag. This Bluetooth device from Anova Culinary will help him keep heat and water circulation constant, ensuring that the food will be cooked thoroughly and evenly. A robot vacuum For dads who hate cleaning Whether he's Danny Tanner-level clean or is as messy as a teenager, Dad won't say no to a less-taxing vacuuming routine. The Roomba 694 is one of iRobot's most affordable and most popular connected vacuums, and it can be controlled via smartphone, Alexa, or traditional buttons. He can schedule cleanings or let it roam free and to find concentrated areas of dirt, pet hair, and other debris. Amazon Echo Show For dads who check in Connected dads probably aren't new to Alexa, and the Echo Show is the ultimate Echo device to bring all his tech together on one screen. A drop-in feature lets him make video calls without the other person having to pick up, which is just a great parenting tool in general. He can also watch live TV, call up recipe and DIY videos, and use voice commands with smart plugs or lights. Self-chilling beer glasses For dads who need a drink Keeping that one special mug in the freezer is such a dad thing to do. These self-chilling beer glasses will make his post-work drink even more relaxing — they have freezable inserts to keep drinks cold for 30 minutes and built-in coasters on the bottom. The same company also makes self-cooling margarita, whiskey, and wine glasses. A reusable water bottle For eco-friendly dads Help him cut down on plastic and prevent recycling bin overflow with a reusable water bottle from Yeti. This BPA-free, stainless steel bottle works to keep cold drinks cold or hot drinks hot for at least 12 hours, and does so while preventing condensation. This one is complete with a handle on top for grab-and-go convenience to take on a hike, to the gym, and more. Daily wear sunscreen For dads who hate hats Skincare is for everyone. If he's not about to do a five-step routine, daily sunscreen application is an easy starting point to help prevent signs of aging and protect against UV rays. This double-duty moisturizer and SPF 20 sunscreen is simple enough for quick daily application, but can be used extra for days spent in the yard or on the beach. Jonathan from Queer Eye would be proud. \"Best dad in the galaxy\" shirt For Star Wars-obsessed dads He is your father — literally. Any Star Wars-loving dad will appreciate this \"Best dad in the galaxy\" shirt, which combines that corny dad humor with an OG trilogy reference. This one sports Vader's two favorite colors and can be customized with a name. A phone and Apple Watch dock For dads on team Apple Some dads are clueless about tech, but some are more obsessed with Apple than we are. If he's the latter, free him from that drawer full of tangled cords with the Belkin MagSafe 3-in-1 charging station. This handy organizer wirelessly charges his phone, Apple Watch, and Airpods — and honestly kind of doubles as nightstand decor. A personalized money clip For cash-carrying dads Let Dad carry a piece of you wherever he goes with a money clip featuring a personalized note from his pride and joy. This Etsy shop has over 6,000 five-star reviews and allows you to create a one-of-a-kind clip with a note of your choosing — it can even be in your handwriting. Make it sentimental with a classic \"I love you,\" keep it simple with your name, or add an inside joke. Fizzics Draft Dispenser For beer fans Help your beer connoisseur of a father bring the party wherever he goes with the Fizzics Draft Dispenser. From the makers of Fizzics Waytap, this Kickstarter success story converts regular beer carbonation (IPAs, lagers, or stouts) into uniform bubbles for a creamy, frothy head and enhanced aromas. It's even rechargeable via USB. A personal espresso maker For dads who need a boost A constant IV of coffee may not be possible (yet), but superman dads can get that early morning jolt with their own espresso maker. The Nespresso VertuoPlus by De'Longhi offers barista-grade espresso, coffee, or iced coffee, all for cheaper and faster than Starbucks. It even comes with 12 flavor capsules. An indoor herb garden For crunchy dads Going organic is the hot move, but shopping at Whole Foods adds up. Click and Grow smart gardens can give him a personal garden right in his kitchen, even during the cold seasons. Replaceable pods are only $10 a pop, with strawberries, tomatoes, and arugula all on the menu. A breakfast sandwich maker For super busy dads Save dad some time (and money) on busy mornings with this dual breakfast sandwich maker from Hamilton Beach. Whether he makes two of the same sandwich or switches it up, he'll be able to skip the Egg McMuffin line and start his morning off right. The Fire TV Stick For cord-cutting dads Cord cutters don't have to resort to broadcast channels and reruns of Castle. The Amazon Fire TV Stick basically turns any TV into a smart TV and keeps apps like Netflix, Hulu, and Prime Video all in one place. He'll have the hang of it in seconds, regardless of whether he's tech-savvy or not. A waterproof portable charger For outdoorsy dads He probably ignores his phone when he's enjoying the great outdoors, but having a dead phone in the middle of nowhere just isn't smart. This solar-powered, waterproof one was made for a more rugged lifestyle. (Even if \"rugged\" means \"trying to find parking at Target on a Saturday.\") It can recharge an iPhone up to three times before needing to be charged itself. The Echo Dot For non tech-savvy dads Hands-free commands in any room is undeniably awesome, even if he's not huge on tech. The Echo Dot is an inconspicuous little speaker that he can use to control smart home features like lights or blinds, set timers, or use as a household intercom. A cool waterproof speaker For the DJ dad The dad who always wants to play his tunes for the family can take his favorite tracks anywhere he pleases. Or if you need to send him outside with his music, this portable speaker will make that easy. The speaker is capable of connecting to two sources at the same time, so you can take over the playlist if the need arises. Saloon Box Cocktail Kit For wannabe bartender dads Many dads love to play mixologist and whip up fancy drinks when people are over — whether they're actually good is another story. Cratejoy's SaloonBox is a DIY cocktail subscription box that will teach him how to make bar-style cocktails. Each box includes supplies to make four drinks (including alcohol), plus seasonal recipes and extras like lemons or limes. A neck massager For stressed dads Knots and nagging back pain can interfere with daily activities — and even if they don't, they're just plain annoying. Even though your dad may not admit that something hurts, this portable shiatsu massager can give him the quick relief he so deserves with kneading that mimics a deep tissue massage. It's perfect for at home, at work, or in the car. A Nintendo Switch For the gamer dad If your dad never quite outgrew his gamer phase, welcome him to today's style of gaming with the Nintendo Switch. He’ll constantly be commenting about how much better video games are these days than when he was a kid. If you’ve got a device too, wirelessly connect for a multiplayer game and a whole new digital way to spend time together. Amazon Audible For multitasking dads Reading is a seriously underrated method of relaxation, but a lot of dads are way too busy to sit down with a book. Amazon Audible can keep Dad busy on every drive, run, or commute, with titles ranging from Stephen King novels to self-help reads on parenting a newborn. He'll get a credit each month to pick a new title, and his library can be accessed on iOS, Android, Echo, and more. A vintage-style turntable For vinyl-loving dads Parents love turning on the radio just to roast today's \"shitty\" music. Let him put those records in the attic to good use with this portable Bluetooth record player by Victrola. He can blast AC/DC and Hall \u0026 Oates to his heart's content, then switch to Bluetooth for newer jams that he will never admit to liking. Two needles are included and it comes in 20 colors. A mini projector For the dad who loves home movies If he’s always gathering everyone around the TV to watch old home movies, help him take the show on the road. He can set up this mini projector anywhere he wants — as long as there’s an outlet nearby. The device even connects to smartphones so he can project newly-captured footage for the whole family, too. The Üllo Wine Preserver For particular dads If he's tired of being the lone beer drinker at his friends' wine and cheese nights, this preserver may be able to change his mind about wine. Üllo aerates vino to highlight the natural flavors of every glass while getting rid of the sulfites that cause headaches — because we all know how hangovers get worse with age. A portable grill For the grill master For the dad who’s always trying to get everyone together for a barbecue, this portable charcoal grill helps him take his grilling skills anywhere he wants. Whether you’re planning a day at the beach or he wants to make hot dogs at the next tailgate, he’ll love this easy-to-transport grill. A personalized cutting board For dads who grill Father's Day falls at such a convenient time — it's grilling season, baby. If dad's been waiting all year to break out his shiny grill and patio furniture, deck out his favorite space with this personalized cutting board. It's guaranteed to make him feel special, and you'll probably get a free meal out of it. A rugged AirPods case For dads who have Airpods You know dads who have AirPods think they're cool AF for it. Make him feel even cooler with this rugged, military-esque case to protect his precious ‘pods. It’s made with reinforced bumpers that protect against scratches, shocks, and drops, and a soft, grippy surface that repels dust and fingerprints. Plus, it just looks super cool.

A bonsai tree kit For the dad looking for new hobbies If his kids are finally out of the house and he’s looking for something else to raise, give him a bonsai. The little trees not only add a dose of calm to any room, they’re (genuinely) fun to watch grow.

Some high-power binoculars For the outdoor adventurer Whether he enjoys bird-watching, hunting, or just taking in the views on his favorite hikes, these high-power binoculars will bring nature into focus.

They’ve got low-light vision so he won’t have to stop watching the world through his binoculars even when the sun is setting.
