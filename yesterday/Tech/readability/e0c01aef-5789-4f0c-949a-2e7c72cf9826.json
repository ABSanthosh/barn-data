  "text": "Marvel just released a brand new trailer for Captain America: Brave New World and it makes one thing very clear. Captain America and the President have some issues… and they’re about to see red. Opening February 14, Anthony Mackie finally steps into the mantle of Captain America in the film, which sees Harrison Ford take over the role Thaddeus Ross, the former military man now turned U.S. President. This new trailer focuses more on their conflicts with some nice 1970s espionage flair. And, yes, there’s new Red Hulk footage. So what, exactly is going on here? We know Tim Blake Nelson is making his return as the Leader and this trailer in particular makes it seem as if he’s behind this plan. That feels a little too easy though, doesn’t it? All we know is someone is trying to manipulate, and probably kill, the President, and Captain America is in their way. Marvel’s official description doesn’t help either. “Marvel Studios’ Captain America: Brave New World follows Sam Wilson, who after meeting with newly elected U.S. President Thaddeus Ross, finds himself in the middle of an international incident. He must discover the reason behind a nefarious global plot before the true mastermind has the entire world seeing red.” Red, get it? Also, there is lots of footage, but still no full explanation about Tiamut, the giant being from Eternals. Clearly this new land mass plays a huge role too. Let us know what you think of the new trailer below. Captain America: Brave New World stars Anthony Mackie, Danny Ramirez, Shira Haas, Xosha Roquemore, Carl Lumbly, with Giancarlo Esposito, Liv Tyler, Tim Blake Nelson, and Harrison Ford. It’s directed by Julius Onah. Want more io9 news?
