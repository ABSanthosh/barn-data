Sign-up for your spot on Santa Meyer-Nandi’s Ask the Expert session about “How to burn bright, not out” at TNW2025 on June 20 at 15:30. In our work — whether shaping sustainable management frameworks, advising climate innovation funds, or guiding impact entrepreneurs — we see the same silent barrier appear again and again: People are burning out, even as their ideas succeed. And it’s not because they’re disorganised or weak. Quite the opposite. What we see is high-functioning burnout. The founder who delivers and performs but can’t sleep. The policymaker whose campaigns are technically successful but whose nervous system is stuck in survival mode. The sustainability lead who’s holding transformation inside an institution — without feeling held herself. It often looks fine from the outside. But it slowly erodes motivation, creativity, and resilience—qualities that are essential for long-term change. Burnout is not a personal failure. It’s a system response The World Health Organization recognizes burnout as a workplace phenomenon linked to chronic, unmanaged stress. According to a 2022 study by The Hartford, 30% of employees reported being less engaged with their work due to burnout and 25% struggled to concentrate. While these figures are already concerning, they likely underestimate the deeper toll burnout takes in fields like sustainability, public service, or systems change—where the stakes are high and the emotional load is rarely named. In fact, research published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine points to the substantial impact of mental health — related absenteeism and presenteeism on workplace productivity. But in our experience, the cost is not only economic — it’s relational, cultural, and strategic. Burnout often changes the arc of a project long before it becomes visible on paper. Because these individuals are not just managing deadlines. They’re managing resistance. Complexity. Emotional labor. Moral pressure. All while pioneering new paths — often without a map, and often without peers who truly understand the terrain. We’ve worked in boardrooms and ministries. We’ve led public funds and cross-sector partnerships. Again and again, it’s not the lack of good ideas or smart tools that stalls momentum. It’s the human architecture. It’s whether the people involved feel grounded, seen, and supported — both professionally and personally. Why we care about the other side of change I’m an environmental lawyer by training. My co-founder, Dr. Anna Katharina Meyer, has worked across the energy transition, climate finance, and sustainability strategy. Together, we’ve spent years shaping the technical and financial architecture of change: regulation, investments, governance. And yet, time and again, we’ve seen projects falter not because the ideas weren’t sound — but because the people holding them were too depleted to continue. The biggest invisible cost in systemic change is emotional and relational. We’ve seen teams fall apart not for lack of passion — but because they lacked the space to recover and reconnect. Not because people didn’t care — but because they cared alone. That’s why we’ve started speaking more publicly about what we used to consider “side issues”: well-being, self-regulation, and emotional sustainability. Because they’re not side issues at all. What matters is not just what tools people have — but whether the environment allows them to use them fully. We’re not romanticising slowness. We’re professionalizing resilience. Teams that are regulated, connected, and psychologically safe make better decisions. That’s not just a psychological insight. It’s a strategic one. What decision-makers must do now If you’re funding, leading, or designing systems of transformation, here are four places to begin: Create safety inside ambition. High performance and psychological safety are not opposites. They are prerequisites for sustainable excellence. Fund communities, not just projects. Strategic alignment isn’t enough. People need peer relationships and mutual recognition to stay in the work long enough to succeed. Value emotional sustainability. Leaders and teams doing heavy emotional labor need spaces where they can step out of their roles and be human. That’s not indulgent—it’s intelligent. Treat self-management and well-being as operational priorities. Build rhythms for pause, reflection, and recovery into your systems — especially in high-pressure cycles. The future will be shaped by those who can hold complexity — and stay well while doing it. By leaders who know that change doesn’t only live in frameworks, but in culture. By teams that understand that sustainable impact requires internal sustainability too. If we want transformation to last, we need structures that help people stay in the game long enough to truly change it.",
