An Taoiseach Micheál Martin visits Google HQ For Ireland to harness the full benefits of AI and technological progress, it’s crucial for people from all backgrounds to access the latest digital skills. Yesterday at The Foundry, we welcomed Taoiseach Micheál Martin and James Lawless — Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science — to celebrate and recognize the achievements of the first recipients of the Insight AI Scholarship, a program that supports students from underrepresented backgrounds as they look to shape the future of technology.About the scholarshipsThe scholarship program was announced in 2023 as part of Google Ireland’s 20th birthday celebrations. An extensive promotion campaign in the months that followed ensured that the program reached those who could gain the most from this opportunity.Those efforts culminated in yesterday’s event, with the first 39 students of the program receiving their awards from the Taoiseach. Each scholarship is worth €5,000 annually for the duration of a three or four-year undergraduate program, supported through a Google.org grant to Dublin City University (DCU) who are coordinating the programme through the Insight Research Ireland Centre for Data Analytics.The students are enrolled in courses spanning a range of disciplines, including computer science, digital business and even chemistry with AI, at universities and colleges across Ireland.Why it’s importantThe program’s importance is underlined by the reality that many communities across Ireland continue to face barriers to accessing key digital skills. Women make up only 21% of Ireland’s STEM student population, and only 15% of disadvantaged students progress from undergraduate to postgraduate education, according to a 2023 HEA report.The scholarship program invests in students to become future leaders in AI and digital safety, and aims to create a more representative field by supporting underrepresented groups. It is a real achievement that the first cohort of students come from 15 counties across Ireland, that 40% of students in the first cohort are women and that there are participants with disabilities and members of the Traveller community to make the most of this AI opportunity.At the event, we also heard from Minister Lawless before a panel in which DCU academics discussed education’s role in delivering equitable access to our shared digital future. The conversation couldn’t be more timely, given the significant societal and economic opportunities on offer. AI could potentially contribute up to €45 billion to Ireland's GDP over the next decade, so it’s crucial to foster talent in this area.What’s aheadOver the next year, more students will have the opportunity to participate in the program and play their part in creating a more equitable and technologically advanced Irish society. Those looking for more information and on how to apply can do so on Insight’s website. We are proud to support this initiative and look forward to seeing how these scholars make their mark.",
