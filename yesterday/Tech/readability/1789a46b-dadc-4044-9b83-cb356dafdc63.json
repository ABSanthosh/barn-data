Which means it is the electric one. Credit: Mercedes-Benz Underneath this camouflage is the next Mercedes-Benz GLC with EQ Technology. Which means it is the electric one. Credit: Mercedes-Benz IMMENDINGEN, Germany—The Mercedes-Benz Testing and Technology Center in Immendingen, Germany, isn't a top-secret facility because of its location. It's top secret because of what happens on the 520 hectares of land. Its 62-kilometer track is where Mercedes engineers can develop and hone every new vehicle in conditions experienced all around the world. Experiencing those conditions in a prototype is why I was there on an annoyingly rainy day. After receiving the tour in a new Mercedes-Benz S-Class, I settled into the driving seat of the all-new Mercedes-Benz GLC with EQ Technology—that's the electric one. Being a prototype, it was still wearing camouflage, and the interior was covered in black fabric, so I couldn't see everything. But I was assured that the ride, handling, and performance are all sorted. The infotainment software and interior details are still being finalized. The upcoming GLC is slightly longer than its gasoline-powered counterpart to accommodate the 94.5 kWh battery pack. Mercedes is estimating 650 kilometers of range on the optimistic WLTP testing cycle. Based on some rough math, 330 miles on the EPA cycle seems about right. The electric GLC is slightly longer than the gasoline-powered SUV, so it can fit the new battery pack. Credit: Mercedes-Benz 800 V The electrical system onboard is 800 V, and Mercedes is claiming an impressive DC fast-charging rate with a peak greater than 320 kW. While I much prefer a 10 to 80 percent state of charge stat when comparing charging performance, Mercedes is projecting 260 kilometers of range (162 miles) added in 10 minutes on the DC fast charger. A two-speed transmission helps with efficiency—and likely autobahn performance—of the 483 hp (360 kW) powertrain, and it will tow 2.4 metric tons. The version I drove on the test track was a dual-motor setup, which can completely deactivate the front motor for improved efficiency. Aside from helping hold the battery pack, the electric GLC's 3.2 inches (82 mm) longer wheelbase means improved rear legroom and 20.1 cubic feet (570 L) of storage in the trunk. There is also a 3.5 cubic foot (100 L) frunk, which is much more useful than a hood you can't open at all. There is no push-button start on the GLC. If you look at the end of the column-mounted gear stalk, you'll see the little power button icon. That's because, like some EVs from other makes, just sitting in the car powers up the vehicle, so you simply need to put it into gear to start driving. The extra wheelbase and more compact EV powertrain should translate to more interior space in the electric version. Credit: Mercedes-Benz There are several different regeneration modes that you can choose from the steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters, but I was asked not to use the Auto setting because the final calibration might not be complete. I opted for the one-pedal mode for most of my drive. Rolling up to roundabouts and stop signs, the one-pedal mode was easy to calibrate to. It's not as aggressive in negative G-forces as some systems, so it doesn't feel as much like you're riding around with a teenager learning to drive a manual transmission. I preferred this experience over many other one-pedal setups. And the brake pedal no longer moves toward the firewall when one-pedal braking—a very annoying feature of earlier Mercedes EQ models. Rides well Another thing I very much prefer in the GLC is the default Comfort setting for the suspension. Immendingen simulates roads from all around the globe—the US two-lane road was surprisingly similar to a road near my house in Ohio—and there is plenty of opportunity to test the different modes. The Sport setting is good, with ride comfort controlled and comfortable while still being firm. If you're bombing down a back road, I can see being entertained by the setting, though it's no AMG sports car. It's also not as firm as something like a Hyundai Ioniq 5 N. With good range, great fast charging, and a wonderful ride, the GLC with EQ Technology should be a success. Credit: Mercedes-Benz The Comfort setting, however, is excellent. As part of the program, we were invited to drive all the generations of Mercedes S-Class vehicles, and I had just climbed out of a current W223-generation car before my prototype drive. The GLC wafts along the highway in much the same way the S-Class does. It features the air suspension from the S-Class, but having the same hardware doesn't mean it's tuned the same way. It's almost uncanny how the heavy crossover cruises along with nearly the same comfort level as the suspension in the Mercedes-Benz flagship. While I like the Cadillac Lyriq a lot, when it comes to ride comfort in the posh setting, the GLC with EQ Technology is the clear winner. It's hard to find any gripes, though my time behind the wheel was limited. Still, it was good to experience the prototype GLC on a variety of different road surfaces in a short period; that's what makes test facilities awesome. But it wasn't enough time to live with the vehicle, find all its foibles, and render a solid final verdict. That said, my initial impressions are solid. If Mercedes engineers can deliver on the charging performance and get close to its range estimates, it should have a solid EV on its hands. If the final version is as comfortable to drive—and sporty when it needs to be—while being able to haul kids, groceries, and gear like a family car should, the GLC with EQ Technology should find favor. 7 Comments",

As part of the program, we were invited to drive all the generations of Mercedes S-Class vehicles, and I had just climbed out of a current \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/03/tech-works-with-you-not-against-you-in-the-mercedes-benz-s-class/\"\u003eW223-generation car\u003c/a\u003e before my prototype drive. The GLC wafts along the highway in much the same way the S-Class does. It features the air suspension from the S-Class, but having the same hardware doesn\u0026#39;t mean it\u0026#39;s tuned the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s almost uncanny how the heavy crossover cruises along with nearly the same comfort level as the suspension in the Mercedes-Benz flagship. While I like the \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/the-2024-cadillac-lyriq-a-bug-free-ev-with-carplay-thats-still-a-bit-bland/\"\u003eCadillac Lyriq\u003c/a\u003e a lot, when it comes to ride comfort in the posh setting, the GLC with EQ Technology is the clear winner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s hard to find any gripes, though my time behind the wheel was limited. Still, it was good to experience the prototype GLC on a variety of different road surfaces in a short period; that\u0026#39;s what makes test facilities awesome. But it wasn\u0026#39;t enough time to live with the vehicle, find all its foibles, and render a solid final verdict.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, my initial impressions are solid. If Mercedes engineers can deliver on the charging performance and get close to its range estimates, it should have a solid EV on its hands. If the final version is as comfortable to drive—and sporty when it needs to be—while being able to haul kids, groceries, and gear like a family car should, the GLC with EQ Technology should find favor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n          \n                  \u003c/div\u003e\n\n                  \n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u003cp\u003e\n    \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/mercedes-next-electric-glc-rides-great-weve-driven-the-prototype/#comments\" title=\"7 comments\"\u003e\n    \u003csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 80 80\"\u003e\u003cdefs\u003e\u003cclipPath id=\"bubble-zero_svg__a\"\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"none\" stroke-width=\"0\" d=\"M0 0h80v80H0z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/clipPath\u003e\u003cclipPath id=\"bubble-zero_svg__b\"\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"none\" stroke-width=\"0\" d=\"M0 0h80v80H0z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/clipPath\u003e\u003c/defs\u003e\u003cg clip-path=\"url(#bubble-zero_svg__a)\"\u003e\u003cg fill=\"currentColor\" clip-path=\"url(#bubble-zero_svg__b)\"\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M80 40c0 22.09-17.91 40-40 40S0 62.09 0 40 17.91 0 40 0s40 17.91 40 40\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M40 40 .59 76.58C-.67 77.84.22 80 2.01 80H40z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/g\u003e\u003c/g\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\n    7 Comments\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n      \u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/article\u003e\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \u003cheader\u003e\n      \u003csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 40 26\"\u003e\u003cdefs\u003e\u003cclipPath id=\"most-read_svg__a\"\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"none\" d=\"M0 0h40v26H0z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/clipPath\u003e\u003cclipPath id=\"most-read_svg__b\"\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"none\" d=\"M0 0h40v26H0z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/clipPath\u003e\u003c/defs\u003e\u003cg clip-path=\"url(#most-read_svg__a)\"\u003e\u003cg fill=\"none\" clip-path=\"url(#most-read_svg__b)\"\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M20 2h.8q1.5 0 3 .6c.6.2 1.1.4 1.7.6 1.3.5 2.6 1.3 3.9 2.1.6.4 1.2.8 1.8 1.3 2.9 2.3 5.1 4.9 6.3 6.4-1.1 1.5-3.4 4-6.3 6.4-.6.5-1.2.9-1.8 1.3q-1.95 1.35-3.9 2.1c-.6.2-1.1.4-1.7.6q-1.5.45-3 .6h-1.6q-1.5 0-3-.6c-.6-.2-1.1-.4-1.7-.6-1.3-.5-2.6-1.3-3.9-2.1-.6-.4-1.2-.8-1.8-1.3-2.9-2.3-5.1-4.9-6.3-6.4 1.1-1.5 3.4-4 6.3-6.4.6-.5 1.2-.9 1.8-1.3q1.95-1.35 3.9-2.1c.6-.2 1.1-.4 1.7-.6q1.5-.45 3-.6zm0-2h-1c-1.2 0-2.3.3-3.4.6-.6.2-1.3.4-1.9.7-1.5.6-2.9 1.4-4.3 2.3-.7.5-1.3.9-1.9 1.4C2.9 8.7 0 13 0 13s2.9 4.3 7.5 7.9c.6.5 1.3 1 1.9 1.4 1.3.9 2.7 1.7 4.3 2.3.6.3 1.3.5 1.9.7 1.1.3 2.3.6 3.4.6h2c1.2 0 2.3-.3 3.4-.6.6-.2 1.3-.4 1.9-.7 1.5-.6 2.9-1.4 4.3-2.3.7-.5 1.3-.9 1.9-1.4C37.1 17.3 40 13 40 13s-2.9-4.3-7.5-7.9c-.6-.5-1.3-1-1.9-1.4-1.3-.9-2.8-1.7-4.3-2.3-.6-.3-1.3-.5-1.9-.7C23.3.4 22.1.1 21 .1h-1\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#ff4e00\" d=\"M20 5c-4.4 0-8 3.6-8 8s3.6 8 8 8 8-3.6 8-8-3.6-8-8-8m0 11c-1.7 0-3-1.3-3-3s1.3-3 3-3 3 1.3 3 3-1.3 3-3 3\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/g\u003e\u003c/g\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\n      \n    \u003c/header\u003e\n    \u003col\u003e\n              \u003cli\u003e\n                      \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/microsoft-dives-into-the-handheld-gaming-pc-wars-with-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally/\"\u003e\n              \u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/BOOTUP_KV-768x432-1749415871.jpg\" alt=\"Listing image for first story in Most Read: Microsoft dives into the handheld gaming PC wars with the Asus ROG Xbox Ally\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n                    \n        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003e\n                    \n        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003e\n                    \n        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003e\n                    \n        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003e\n                    \n        \u003c/li\u003e\n                  \u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/main\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
