  "description": "Samsung will host a virtual Unpacked event on May 12 at 8PM ET. It streams live at the Samsung Newsroom and on the company’s official YouTube page. The company promises a look at \"the next evolution of Galaxy\" devices and that it’ll unveil \"more about the latest addition to the Galaxy S series.\" This means we’ll get more juicy tidbits about that slim Galaxy S25 Edge smartphone that was first teased at an Unpacked event in January. What to expect: Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge The company has confirmed via a blog post that the event will shine a light on the Galaxy S25 Edge, which was a long-rumored device before the official tease a few months ago. Samsung did give us a bit of information regarding specs. It offers a slimmer form factor than the standard S25 and includes an impressive 200MP wide camera lens. The company also boasts that the phone will integrate with Galaxy AI to help the camera transform \"into a smart lens that helps recognize what matters to create new memories.\" We don’t know if that translates to brand-new camera software or if the company’s referring to the pre-existing suite of AI tools available with its newer handsets. Galaxy S25 Edge、理想的すぎるwwwめちゃくちゃほしい.... https://t.co/L1JBl8DCRD pic.twitter.com/zofJ3BLyGX— ちえほん📱モバイルドットコム (@chehonz201) January 22, 2025 We're still in the dark regarding traditional specs. Samsung’s blog post is heavy on hyperbole, calling the S25 Edge \"a powerful AI companion and an engineering marvel\" that merges \"flagship-level performance with superior portability.\" The company goes on to say the new handset \"not only sets a new standard for what you can achieve with your smartphone, but it also unlocks a new era of growth for the mobile industry.\" We’ll find out just how true these words are on May 12. Will this Unpacked event start and stop with the S25 Edge? That’s likely, but it’s always possible that Samsung will throw a curveball our way. Maybe the standard S25 Edge will get companion smartphones that are more powerful, like the S25+ or S25 Ultra. It’s also highly possible the company will reveal a new AI tool or two.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-is-hosting-a-virtual-unpacked-event-on-may-12-at-8pm-et-230026574.html?src=rss",
