  "text": "The BBC reports Apple will change how iPhones and other devices display Apple Intelligence-summarized notifications to make it clearer to users when its AI tech has adjusted the words. Not long after the still-in-beta feature launched in the UK in December, the news organization complained about how it rewrote a headline about the UnitedHealthcare shooting suspect, incorrectly suggesting that the BBC reported Luigi Mangione shot himself. Since then, according to the BBC, Apple’s summaries had incorrectly rewritten notifications from its app to name a PDC World Darts Championship winner before the event even started and falsely claiming that Rafael Nadal revealed himself as gay. “These AI summarisations by Apple do not reflect – and in some cases completely contradict – the original BBC content,” writes the outlet.The BBC reports that Apple said in a statement, “A software update in the coming weeks will further clarify when the text being displayed is summarization provided by Apple Intelligence.”Apple Intelligence has had its funny moments, but there have also been some shocking failures, like summarizing a text message saying “that hike almost killed me” as “attempted suicide.”Apple told the BBC that receiving summaries is optional. If you want to exercise that option, you can disable the feature or alter what apps use it by going to Settings \u003e Notifications \u003e Summarize Notifications.",
