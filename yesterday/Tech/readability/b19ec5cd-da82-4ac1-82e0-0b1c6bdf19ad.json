  "text": "December is a good time to think about your next career move. Your colleagues may be on a go-slow when it comes to getting projects over the line ahead of the Christmas holiday period, but for those with an eye on 2025’s job-hunting prize, this month can be a really fruitful time to look for a new opportunity. Bonnie Dilber, who is a recruiting leader at Zapier and an HR influencer on TikTok, explains why, based on her nine-plus years of hiring experience. “Basically you have a situation at the end of the year where companies may have fewer roles posted, but they’re generally really urgent about closing out the ones they have posted, and you have less competition.” 5 jobs to discover all across Europe now Senior Fullstack Developer (m/w/d), Eberlein Kunz, Berlin Software Engineer, Staal Verbind B.V., Amersfoort Développeur Python, Alter Solutions, Paris Cloud Software Architect / Developer (all genders), Mazars GmbH \u0026 Co. KG, Berlin Outsystems Developer, TIP Group, Amsterdam “Budgets turn over at the end of the year and some companies are set up so if they don’t make that hire within the fiscal year, then they lose that budget. So they’re going to want to close out the roles that they have opened.” Dilber also explains why competition is diluted as the festive season approaches. “A lot of candidates actually opt out of interviewing at this time of the year. Folks who are employed have end of year bonuses, they may have shares that are vesting. Often they’re not wanting to start a new job until sometime like February or March.” Armed with this intel, what can you do to accelerate your 2025 career aspirations ahead of the pack? And when it comes to the best cities for software developers in Europe, where should you focus your attention? Strong tech performers Your mind might go to the big tech hubs of London, Berlin and Paris first. These cities are always in demand, and according to Startup Genome’s most recent Global Startup Ecosystem Report, London reigns supreme. The total value of London’s tech ecosystem was $621.5 billion in 2023. It’s home to 103 unicorns and has seen an 800% rise in VC investment over the past decade. In fact, VCs invested $12 billion in London in 2023. When it comes to Berlin, the picture is also rosy. The German government is investing heavily in the sector, and in 2023 launched Growth Fund Germany, a $1.76 billion pool of funds for investment in German VCs. In the same year, it launched a DeepTech \u0026 Climate Funds initiative, allocating $1.76 billion to growth-stage companies in these two sub-sectors. Additionally, Berlin saw 468 startups founded in 2023, and interestingly 49% of all startup employees are non-German citizens, offering workers one of the most diverse workforces in the world. In Paris, the news is also positive. The French capital boasts more than 8,000 startups, as well as the world’s largest startup campus, Station F. French startups raised €8.3 billion in 2023, and France was notable in that it was one of just two European countries that had more fund closings in 2023 than 2022. As a result it is not surprising that software developers are increasingly drawn to these major European cities––not just for the work opportunities. Competitive salaries, vibrant tech ecosystems, innovation-first approaches and cultural attractions all figure too. 5 more software roles to consider GiS Platform Engineer (f/m/d), Uniper, Landshut BI Spezialist, Business Intelligence (m/w/d), ETERNA Mode GmbH, Passau Cloud Engineer, YoungOrange B.V., Utrecht West System engineer Datapower, belastingdienst, Apeldoorn Fullstack developer | SaaS, Haystack People, Utrecht Tech cities to watch When it comes to the ones to watch, or the cities where developers may find interesting roles to flex their muscles at early stage companies, which cities and countries should they look to? Startup Genome’s report highlights Copenhagen as a top global fintech hub. In 2023, the Danish capital’s fintech startups secured the third most VC funding per capita among the top 10 European ecosystems. For developers proficient in creating forecasting models, developing trading algorithms, and building new apps and tools for customers, this city offers opportunities for those with Python, Java, C++, C#, Ruby, and SQL skills. And according to Levels, the median software engineering salary in Copenhagen is a cool €93,260, rising to €134.1K for highly experienced developers. Serbia is also experiencing a booming startup scene. Compensation is lower at a median figure of €60,619, but so is the cost of living. The cities of Belgrade and Novi Sad can offer developers exciting opportunities in gaming, blockchain, and life sciences. Investment in the country is on the increase with the report finding that the ecosystem saw $70 million in investments in 2023. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has also invested a record $846 million in Serbia, with China investing $2.18 billion in Serbian renewable energy too. In Italy, Turin is emerging as a burgeoning tech hub. Historically, it has been known as a centre for the automotive industry, but is now Italy’s second-largest city in terms of investment volume, recording $70.8 million across 60 funding rounds for its startups in 2023. Wages are modest here, at a median level of €36,474, but for developers interested in the areas of smart cities, AI, big data and analytics, as well as space tech, Turin is a city to consider. Budapest and Istanbul are also on the rise as tech hubs. Budapest is projected to outpace average EU growth with a 2.8% GDP increase in 2025, and has seen some excellent deals in the life sciences sector. Biotech firm Turbine’s cell simulation technology for cancer R\u0026D secured a $6 million Series A in 2023, with VRG Therapeutics receiving a $5.5 million Series A the same year. In Istanbul, the startup sector is boosted by a network of 66 accelerators and 47 incubators, and the country considered the issue of STEM talent from early on. As a result, the country produces 98,000 STEM graduates annually, of which 35% are women. Ready to find your next software job? Check out The Next Web Job Board",
