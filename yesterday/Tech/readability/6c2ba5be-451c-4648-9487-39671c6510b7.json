  "description": "gdm (Slashdot reader #97,336) writes: A study published in Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives investigates how ants avoid traffic jams.... Quoting the abstract: \"The results show that ants adopt specific traffic strategies (platoon formation, quasi-constant speed and no overtaking maneuvers) that help avoid jam phenomena, even at high density.\" \"Researchers are now studying these insects' cooperative tactics to learn how to program self-driving cars that don't jam up,\" writes Scientific American: \"We're maximizing the interests of individuals, [which] is why, at a given point, you start to have a traffic jam,\" says study co-author Nicola Pugno, who studies sustainable engineering at the University of Trento in Italy. But self-driving cars, if they one day become ubiquitous, could have more cooperative programming. In one vision of this future, autonomous vehicles would share information with nearby cars to optimize traffic flow — perhaps, the researchers suggest, by prioritizing constant speeds and headways or by not passing others on the road... Today's drivers can learn at least one thing from ants to avoid causing a traffic jam, says Katsuhiro Nishinari [a mathematical physicist at the University of Tokyo, who studies traffic]: don't tailgate. By leaving room between their car and the one ahead of them, drivers can absorb a wave of braking in dense traffic conditions that would otherwise be amplified into a full-blown \"phantom\" traffic jam with no obvious cause. \"Just keeping away,\" he says, can help traffic flow smoothly. In the article the researchers admit there are differences between humans stuck in traffic and ants. \"Unlike cars, ants don't crash; they can literally walk over one another.\" And if they're backed up in a tunnel, \"they'll find a way to walk on the ceiling!\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
