  "text": "Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse has been delayed yet again, only this time, it’s less of a problem and more of a recalibration. The third and final film in the Oscar-winning animated trilogy was originally supposed to be out in early 2024 but was then delayed all the way to June 4, 2027. Now, Sony has tweaked that further and moved the film back three more weeks to June 25, 2027. The reason for this move isn’t because production needs more time, however. Apparently it has more to do with just locking in a better release date after kids are out of school for the summer. Plus, producer and writer Christopher Miller noted on X that it’s a “better IMAX window,” which, indeed, it is. June 4 was just one week after Star Wars: Starfighter and one week before How to Train Your Dragon 2. Now, Spider-Verse has nothing significant bumping up against it for the rest of the summer. That’ll change, but it’s good to plant the flag. The third film will reportedly pick up right where the second one left off, with our hero Miles Morales stuck in an alternate dimension with a version of himself who turned into the Prowler. Across the multiverse, Gwen Stacy and several of Miles’ friends begin a journey to find and save him, hoping to not destroy the entire universe in the process. And while, yes, it’s a bummer to have to wait multiple years to see the final piece of the puzzle, plus three extra weeks, no one will remember that decades from now if the third film sticks the landing of this trilogy like we all hope it will. It’s already, maybe, the greatest superhero one-two in the history of movies. If Beyond the Spider-Verse brings it home in a way this team is capable of? Oh man. We’ll be talking about these movies until the day we die. If we aren’t already. Plus, we should have at least one Spider-Man movie to hold us over in the meantime. Spider-Man: Brand New Day, starring Tom Holland, is still scheduled for release on July 31, 2026. Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse is directed by Bob Persichetti and Justin K. Thompson from a screenplay by Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, and David Callaham. Expect it in theaters, not on June 4, but on June 25, 2027. Want more io9 news?
