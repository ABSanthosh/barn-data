The futuristic new facility expands access to Neko’s high-tech health vision. Blending body scans, lidar sensors, and AI with blood tests, eye pressure checks, and strength tests, the startup maps millions of data points in minutes.  The findings can reveal warning signs about the skin, heart, blood vessels, and inflammation. A human doctor then immediately takes the user through the findings. Within an hour of arriving, they’re on their way out of the clinic. The system is the brainchild of Spotify CEO Daniel Ek and his business partner Hjalmar Nilsonne. The duo want to shift healthcare systems from reactive to proactive. After launching Neko in their native Sweden in 2023, they began expanding the service to London last year, starting with a new health centre in the chic neighbourhood of Marylebone. The second London facility dramatically expands the company’s capacity. Located in the buzzy Spitalfields Market, the centre covers a roomy 7,466 square feet, with capacity for up to 30,000 scans annually. “This health centre is built for scale, and we’re doubling down in London,” said Nilsonne. London calling Neko The new centre has a suitably space-age design, which echoes the aesthetic of the inaugural London site. Neko already has plans to open two more clinics in the UK’s capital, with launches in other cities in the country also targeted for this year. A spokesperson for the company told TNW that London was “a strategic choice” for Neko’s international expansion beyond Stockholm. “It represents the global market in a way; offering a lot of health tourism and a very competitive space when it comes to private healthcare,” they said. “If we can break into this market we have a chance to do it elsewhere. Additionally, London is a global healthcare hub, with world-class medical institutions and research centres.” The city also evidently has enough people prepared to pay the £299 that each body scan costs. The Marylebone centre attracted lengthy waitlists. Across the London and Stockholm sites, 80% of members book and prepay a scan for the following year at the end of their appointment, Neko said. Between the two centres, Neko has now completed over 15,000 scans. Earlier this year, TNW added one more to the total. During the doctor’s consultation, we were advised to seek a further review. Once we finally have our appointment with the NHS, we’ll reveal all the details about our experience — and Neko’s findings. If you want to try the scan out for yourself, you can sign up to the waitlist here. The future of healthcare on the agenda for TNW Conference, which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.
