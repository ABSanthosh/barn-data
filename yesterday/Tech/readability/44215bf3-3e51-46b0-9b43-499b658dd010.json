  "text": "A majority (65%) of shoppers in the U.S. say they've recently dedicated more time to finding deals to make sure they’re getting the best value. 1 Luckily, the Google Shopping Graph, with more than 50 billion product listings from across the web, can help you find the best prices. With warmer weather approaching, I’m about to start searching for my summer essentials — and these are the Shopping tools I’ll be using to spot the best deals:Find markdowns in the “Deals” tab. With Google Shopping, you can find deals from across the web, relevant to what you’ve been shopping for. To get started, simply navigate to the left-hand panel in the Shopping tab and tap “Deals.” There you can quickly browse deals and find offers from your favorite brands in one convenient place. I’m on the hunt for a suitcase, so I’ll be checking out those deals to find the best one for all my travels. 2. Compare prices before you buy. Before you hit “buy” it helps to know if you’re getting the best price. With Google, you can just search for the product and tap the image to instantly compare prices from different retailers — you might find it available at another store for less! Ahead of my vacation, I want some Bluetooth headphones. I plan on comparing prices across retailers so that I don't pay too much for the exact same pair. U.S. shoppers can now easily spot the best deals from high-quality sellers, thanks to the new “best price” badge. 3. Get price insights. More than two-thirds of consumers report that price has grown in importance in their purchasing decisions over the past three months. 1 Let’s say I’m searching for a portable charger — as soon as you click on the product on Google, you can see whether the price is high, low or typical based on how stores have priced it over the past three months. And now when you click on a product listing on Google, you can view its price history across individual retailers, giving you even more clarity before you hit “add to cart.” 4. Track the price. If you aren’t ready to buy, Google can track price changes for you and send an alert when it drops. I might want to get a new pair of sneakers for my favorite summer run club — it’s easy to just tap the “track price” icon next to the ones I like in Search to start tracking them. Then I’ll get a notification by email when the price drops at any store. Finding what I need for summer at a good price shouldn’t be stressful — and using these shopping tools, it won’t be.
