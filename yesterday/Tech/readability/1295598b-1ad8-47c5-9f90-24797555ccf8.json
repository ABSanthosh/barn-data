  "text": "You’ll need to fuel up to keep your energy going at Epic Universe, and there’s no short supply of the most bananas (in some cases) and bonkers fandom-inspired food and drinks in each portal. io9 recently visited Epic Universe during its media preview and got to try many of the theme park foodie culinary delights to see what’s worth trying—and what might just be cute for a social media picture. From Viking fare in Berk to lab concoctions in the Dark Universe, here are some of the most outrageous things we tried. Super Nintendo World © io9 Gizmodo Okay, we had to try the DK Crush Float because we needed to get the barrel mug it came in. Never mind the taste—which was a pungent pineapple soda and banana ice-cream assault on the palette. You’ll feel like you got the barrel cracked open into your mouth along with it, complete with caramel popcorn pieces and shards of chocolate. It’s a lot. But if those flavors are your thing, you do you. Special mention: there’s a plant-based green shell for vegan representation. The Isle of Berk © io9 Gizmodo Hands down the best handy meal at Epic Universe: the mac and cheese cones at Hooligan’s Grog \u0026 Gruel. They come in various combination toppings including Goldfish crackers, PB\u0026J (pork, bacon and jam), and Dragon Fire Chicken (spicy). They’re incredible and easy to eat. Special mention: The Mead Hall’s Yaknog, which is basically a cinnamon forward iced hot chocolate, and Stormfly’s Catch of the Day, a decorated chocolate mousse filled fish (just the shape, not the flavor) served on a bed of colorful crispy cereal (think Fruity Pebbles). Dark Universe © io9 Gizmodo The Burning Blade is the most metal themed food location in the park. It’s a fun, themed tavern with drinks that pay homage to the Universal Monsters. The Monocaine mocktail is fizzy and green—and is inspired by what turns the Invisible Man invisible. It also comes in a souvenir lab beaker and does not in fact make you invisible enough to ride Monsters Unchained multiple times. Special mention: the Frankenstein’s Monster head-shaped pretzel that comes with a white cheese dipping sauce, available at  De Lacey’s Cottage. (We brought it into the Burning Blade Tavern for photo purposes.) Celestial Park © io9 Gizmodo The Pizza Moon locale is a delightfully tasty and gorgeous spot with A Trip to the Moon aesthetics, where you can keep cool and eat some darn good pizza pies. We loved the Pizza Lunare, which features a purple ube crusted dough and is topped with melty béchamel, fromage de lune ricotta, pancetta, and roasted garlic. Special mention: Frosty Moon ice cream with swirl cones topped with celestial marshmallow charms and star-shaped gold sprinkles. Epic Universe is now open. Some food was provided by Universal and some was paid for by the writer. Want more io9 news?
