  "description": "Did you know there's an initiative to drive Open Source adoption both within the United Nations — and globally? Launched in March, it's the work of the Digital Technology Network (under the UN's chief executive board) which \"works to advance open source technologies throughout UN agencies,\" promoting \"collaboration and scalable solutions to support the UN's digital transformation.\" Fun fact: The first group to endorse the initiative's principles was the Open Source Initiative... \"The Open Source Initiative applauds the United Nations for recognizing the growing importance of Open Source in solving global challenges and building sustainable solutions, and we are honored to be the first to endorse the UN Open Source Principles,\" said Stefano Maffulli, executive director of OSI. But that's just the beginining, writes It's FOSS News: As part of the UN Open Source Principles initiative, the UN has invited other organizations to support and officially endorse these principles. To collect responses, they are using CryptPad instead of Google Forms... If you don't know about CryptPad, it is a privacy-focused, open source online collaboration office suite that encrypts all of its content, doesn't log IP addresses, and supports a wide range of collaborative documents and tools for people to use. While this happened back in late March, we thought it would be a good idea to let people know that a well-known global governing body like the UN was slowly moving towards integrating open source tech into their organization... I sincerely hope the UN continues its push away from proprietary Big Tech solutions in favor of more open, privacy-respecting alternatives, integrating more of their workflow with such tools. 16 groups have already endorsed the UN Open Source Principles (including the GNOME Foundation, the Linux Foundation, and the Eclipse Foundation). Here's the eight UN Open Source Principles: Open by default: Making Open Source the standard approach for projects Contribute back: Encouraging active participation in the Open Source ecosystem Secure by design: Making security a priority in all software projects Foster inclusive participation and community building: Enabling and facilitating diverse and inclusive contributions Design for reusability: Designing projects to be interoperable across various platforms and ecosystems Provide documentation: Providing thorough documentation for end-users, integrators and developers RISE (recognize, incentivize, support and empower): Empowering individuals and communities to actively participate Sustain and scale: Supporting the development of solutions that meet the evolving needs of the UN system and beyond.
