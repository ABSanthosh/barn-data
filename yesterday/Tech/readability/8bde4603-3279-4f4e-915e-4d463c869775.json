For what it's worth, Google is far from alone — as Mashable's Cecily Mauran pointed out, AI-powered TVs are one of the big trends of CES 2025. Here are three things the Gemini-enhanced TVs will reportedly be able to do after its planned release later this year. 1. Chat with your TVEver struggle to find that one movie you're looking for? Google seems to think Gemini can help there. It wrote in a blog post about the new TVs: Mashable Light Speed \"You and your family will be able to gather together and have a natural conversation with your TV. This will make searching through your media easier than ever, and you will be able to ask questions about travel, health, space, history and more, with videos in the results for added context.\"The idea is that you can use Gemini to ask your TV questions, access specific content, or perform other tasks. 2. Read the news to youAs TechCrunch noted, the new Gemini TVs will be able to read you a daily news brief it generates after \"the AI assistant [scrapes] news stories from across the internet and YouTube video headlines posted by trusted news channels.\" That seems neat on its surface, but it is also a bit troubling considering all the trouble AI tools — Google's included — have had with getting basic facts correct. 3. Know when you're aroundThe new TVs will be outfitted with sensors that can tell when you're nearby, prompting the TV to \"show 'personalized and informative widgets' with the weather or news stories,\" the Verge noted.You might never need to ask Alexa the temperature outside again.
