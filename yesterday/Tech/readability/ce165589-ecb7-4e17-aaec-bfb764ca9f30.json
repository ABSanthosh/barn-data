  "text": "Samsung recently unveiled the Galaxy Z Flip 7, and while the phone is still expensive -- it'll set you back $1,100 to start -- it's matching the price of its predecessor. That's admirable considering this newest iteration of the Flip phone series features several upgrades, including bigger screens and more powerful hardware. But the Z Flip 7 isn't the only clamshell foldable Samsung is debuting this summer. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is slightly smaller and bridges the gap between the two generations of Flip models. This \"fan edition\" is positioned as more of a midrange phone, but the $900 price tag is a substantial chunk of change -- to put it into perspective, that's still $200 more than the latest iteration of Motorola's Razr. The Z Flip 7 and Z Flip 7 FE share a lot of similarities, especially when it comes to Samsung's strong commitment to software support. At the end of the day, though, you'll have a clear preference for one design over another -- and that preference might be worth throwing an extra $200 at.If you don't have the time to dive into every facet of these phones, here's the TL;DR: If money isn't an object and you're looking for a Flip model with a cutting edge processor and marginal improvements to the screen size, camera system and battery life, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is the clear choice for you. If you're looking for something close to the Z Flip 7 that has a more conservative feature set for less money -- but you're still willing to spend a bit more money than the average midrange phone -- the Galaxy Z Flip FE positively iterates on the Z Flip 6's processing power, battery and operating system. The Z Flip 7 features a larger cover screen than any of its predecessors. Patrick Holland/CNETDesign and displayCandidly, the biggest and most direct differences between the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and the Z Flip 7 FE are found in the designs of these phones. If you're shelling out an extra $200 for the Z Flip 7, it's probably because of its larger cover screen and thinner body.The Z Flip 7 comes in four different colors. You'll be able to choose from black, grayish blue and red colors in-store, with an additional cool light green Mint color available if you're ordering the foldable online direct from Samsung. The Z Flip 7 FE doesn't feature nearly as many color options -- this particular clamshell device comes in classic black or white, that's it. Those are clean designs, but you lose out on the wider berth of colors available on the Z Flip 7.The Galaxy Z Flip 7 features a 4.1-inch cover screen, which is a pretty substantial increase over its predecessor's 3.4-inch front-facing display. It does this by using the entire area around the camera lenses, which are cut out of the display, instead of the \"folder tab\" design of the Z Flip 6 and the Z Flip 7 FE. The Z Flip 7's cover screen has a 948x1,048p resolution, which should mean it provides you with a sharper image than the Z Flip 7 FE's 720x748p cover screen. The Z Flip 7 is a more colorful phone than its \"fan edition\" counterpart. Screenshot by James Martin/CNETAdditionally, the Z Flip 7 has a 6.9-inch internal display, which is marginally larger than the Z Flip 7 FE's 6.7-inch flipped-open screen. In terms of resolution, however, the Z Flip 7 FE screen is slightly higher than the Z Flip7, though in practical terms they're remarkably similar: The Z Flip 7's internal screen has a 2,520x1,080p resolution and the Z Flip 7 FE has a 2,640x1,080p resolution, while both foldables should support a refresh rate of up to 120Hz.The Z Flip 7 may be thinner than the Z Flip 7 FE, but it doesn't lose much in the way of heftiness. The Z Flip 7 weighs 188g while the Z Flip 7 FE weighs 187g, so they should feel fairly similar stowed away in your pockets.The larger cover screen of the Z Flip 7 will make it easier than ever to organize widgets, check notifications and more. But if you plan to use your phone for gaming or watching videos, you're not losing much screen space with the Z Flip 7 FE's internal screen -- both phones should perform fairly similarly in that regard. The three-camera systems of the Z Flip 7 and Z Flip 7 FE are fairly similar to one another. Joe Maldonado/CNET/PCMagCamerasIt's fairly likely that budding photographers won't be giving up anything by choosing the Z Flip 7 FE over the Z Flip 7. Both phones are slated to have a three-camera system, including a 50-megapixel main camera and a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera on the back and a 10-megapixel front-facing internal camera.If you're familiar with Samsung's Z Flip series, you'll recognize that this looks like the same camera system included within 2024's Z Flip 6 model. As far as we know, it has simply been brought forward and integrated into the next generation of Z Flip foldables.With that being said, CNET experts haven't been able to thoroughly test these phones just yet -- while the cameras look the same on paper, it's hard to say just how your pictures will turn out as you snap shots with the Z Flip 7 and the Z Flip 7 FE. But both foldables support Samsung's Galaxy AI photography features. That means you'll be able to edit and change your pictures on the Z Flip 7 and Z Flip 7 FE on the fly with features like Sketch to Image, which lets users bring doodles to life in the background of their photographs. The clean white Z Flip 7 FE starts out $200 cheaper than the Z Flip 7, although the hardware isn't as powerful. Joe Maldonado/CNET/PCMagBattery, processor and storage specsSlight differences in the batteries on the Z Flip 7 and the Z Flip 7 FE will directly translate to how much uptime you get with your phone between charging periods.The Z Flip 7 is powered by a 4,300 mAh battery, which is a 300mAh upgrade from the battery in the Z Flip 6. We expect that owners will be able to put this model through its paces with some more strenuous use and still get a full day of battery life out of it, but we'll know for sure when we can fully test the phone.On the other hand, the Z Flip 7 FE features a 4,000-mAh battery, which appears to be the same size you'd be getting with last year's Z Flip 6 model. Make no mistake about it: You should still be able to eke out a day's worth of activity before needing to charge this phone. But CNET expert Patrick Holland wasn't thrilled with the battery when testing the Z Flip 6, concluding that it was only marginally better than the Galaxy Z Flip 5's battery life, so we would expect similar performance from the Z Flip 7 FE.The only functional difference between the Z Flip 7 and the Z Flip 7 FE in this regard is that 300mAh capacity difference, but most people likely won't actually feel it in their day-to-day lives.If you're constantly filming, video chatting and scrolling through social media at high brightness (or if you're an avid mobile gamer), the Z Flip 7 may let you stay glued to your screen for a bit longer than the Z Flip 7 FE.The other difference between these two foldables lies in their processor specs. The Z Flip 7 is powered by Samsung's own high-end Exynos 2500 chip, while the Z Flip 7 FE has the Exynos 2400. We're assuming the Z Flip 7 will provide slightly better processing power, but more testing will be required to suss out the differences. A similar chip, the Exynos 2400e, in the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE resulted in slightly lower performance than the Samsung Galaxy S24 (running 2023's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip) in our versus testing.Crucially, both phones should have enough memory to support AI tools -- the Z Flip 7 FE is straddling the line with 8GB of RAM -- which is an important benchmark for any new phone right now. The Z Flip 7 comes with 12GB of RAM, so it has stronger support for the integrated AI tools.If storing photos and downloading apps and games is something you do often, the Z Flip 7 has the edge over the Z Flip 7 FE. The Z Flip 7 starts at 256GB of storage with pricier models featuring a fairly large 512GB, whereas the Z Flip 7 FE starts with 128GB of storage and caps out at 256GB of space. The Z Flip 7 model with the least storage capacity matches the Z Flip 7 FE model with the most storage capacity. The Z Flip 7 and Z Flip 7 FE both run Android 16. Joe Maldonado/CNET/PCMagSoftware support and AIWhen it comes to software support for these two models, you aren't missing out on too much by picking one over the other. Both phones run Android 16, which is an upgrade over the Galaxy Z Flip 6's Android 14 operating system -- a result of Google releasing the newest version of Android months earlier than it typically does.Samsung has committed to shipping updates for the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE for seven years after their launch date. That means you can expect the latest in software and security capabilities for both phones until at least 2032.If you're the type of person that will trade your phone in every few years, this probably won't be what sways you toward picking up one of the latest Flip phones. But if you're like me, and you keep using a phone until it's on its last legs, this promise means you'll be in good hands if you choose to upgrade to either the Flip 7 or the Flip 7 FE.If AI features are your make-or-break variable for a new phone purchase in 2025, you won't find that much of a difference between the Flip 7 and the Flip 7 FE in that regard, either. Both phones support the full suite of Galaxy AI tools as well as Google's Gemini assistant -- the Flip 7 FE's 8GB of RAM should ensure that it can operate these tools, while we expect that the Flip 7's 12GB of RAM could let you run a couple more taxing apps in tandem with the AI.Galaxy Z Flip 7 vs. Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FECover display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate 4.1-inch AMOLED, 948x1,048p, 120Hz refresh rate3.4-inch AMOLED; 720 x 748 pixels; 60Hz refresh rateInternal display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate 6.9-inch AMOLED, 2,520x1,080p, 1-120Hz refresh rate6.7-inch AMOLED; 2,640 x 1,080 pixels; 1-120Hz refresh ratePixel density Cover: 342ppi; Internal: 397ppiCover: 306 ppi; Internal: 425 ppi Dimensions (inches) Open: 2.96 x 6.56 x 0.26 inches; Closed: 2.96 x 3.37 x 0.26 inchesOpen: 6.5 x 2.83 x 0.27 in Closed: 3.35 x 2.83 x 0.59 inDimensions (millimeters) Open: 75.2 x 166.7 x 6.5mm; Closed: 75.2 x 85.5 x 13.7mmOpen: 165.1 x 71.9 x 6.9mm Closed: 85.1 x 71.9 x 14.9mmWeight (grams, ounces) 188g (6.63 oz.)187g (6.6 oz)Mobile software Android 16Android 16Cameras 50-megapixel (main), 12-megapixel (ultrawide)50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide)Internal screen camera 10-megapixel10-megapixelVideo capture 4K at 60fpsTBDProcessor Samsung Exynos 2500Samsung Exynos 2400RAM/storage 12GB + 256GB, 12GB + 512GB8GB + 128GB, 256GBExpandable storage NoneNoneBattery 4,300 mAh4,000 mAhFingerprint sensor YesSideConnector USB-CUSB-CHeadphone jack NoneNoneSpecial features One UI 8, IP48 water resistance, 25W wired charging, Qi wireless charging, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, Galaxy AIIP48 rating, 25W wired charging, wireless charging + powershare, 2x optical zoom (up to 10x digital)US price starts at $1,100$900UK price starts at £1,049£849Australia price starts at AU$1,799AU$1,499",

But if you plan to use your phone for gaming or watching videos, you\u0026#39;re not losing much screen space with the Z Flip 7 FE\u0026#39;s internal screen -- both phones should perform fairly similarly in that regard.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/a0936d883e5f1965a87521d00dc007a2e236aa78/hub/2025/07/11/1c297b67-ad8f-4c35-af45-53c87a9e159f/samsung-unpacked-2025-day-2-8.jpg?auto=webp\u0026amp;width=768\" alt=\"Galaxy Z Flip 7\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(max-width: 1023px)\" srcset=\"https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/efce63810d970348d15490f792b4193afce01578/hub/2025/07/11/1c297b67-ad8f-4c35-af45-53c87a9e159f/samsung-unpacked-2025-day-2-8.jpg?auto=webp\u0026amp;width=1024\" alt=\"Galaxy Z Flip 7\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(max-width: 1440px)\" srcset=\"https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/efd27bb94d6d83d4772d551f852a4e0ff4a38528/hub/2025/07/11/1c297b67-ad8f-4c35-af45-53c87a9e159f/samsung-unpacked-2025-day-2-8.jpg?auto=webp\u0026amp;width=1200\" alt=\"Galaxy Z Flip 7\"/\u003e \u003cimg src=\"\" alt=\"Galaxy Z Flip 7\" height=\"674.0625\" width=\"1200\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe three-camera systems of the Z Flip 7 and Z Flip 7 FE are fairly similar to one another.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003eJoe Maldonado/CNET/PCMag\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCameras\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s fairly likely that budding photographers won\u0026#39;t be giving up anything by choosing the Z Flip 7 FE over the Z Flip 7. Both phones are slated to have a three-camera system, including a 50-megapixel main camera and a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera on the back and a 10-megapixel front-facing internal camera.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re familiar with Samsung\u0026#39;s Z Flip series, you\u0026#39;ll recognize that this looks like the same camera system included within 2024\u0026#39;s Z Flip 6 model.

We expect that owners will be able to put this model through its paces with some more strenuous use and still get a full day of battery life out of it, but we\u0026#39;ll know for sure when we can fully test the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, the Z Flip 7 FE features a 4,000-mAh battery, which appears to be the same size you\u0026#39;d be getting with last year\u0026#39;s Z Flip 6 model. Make no mistake about it: You should still be able to eke out a day\u0026#39;s worth of activity before needing to charge this phone. But CNET expert Patrick Holland wasn\u0026#39;t thrilled with the battery when \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/galaxy-z-flip-6-review-the-aha-moment-that-sold-me-until-i-saw-the-price/\" target=\"_self\"\u003etesting the Z Flip 6\u003c/a\u003e, concluding that it was only marginally better than the Galaxy Z Flip 5\u0026#39;s battery life, so we would expect similar performance from the Z Flip 7 FE.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe only functional difference between the Z Flip 7 and the Z Flip 7 FE in this regard is that 300mAh capacity difference, but most people likely won\u0026#39;t actually feel it in their day-to-day lives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re constantly filming, video chatting and scrolling through social media at high brightness (or if you\u0026#39;re an avid mobile gamer), the Z Flip 7 may let you stay glued to your screen for a bit longer than the Z Flip 7 FE.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other difference between these two foldables lies in their processor specs. The Z Flip 7 is powered by Samsung\u0026#39;s own high-end Exynos 2500 chip, while the Z Flip 7 FE has the Exynos 2400. We\u0026#39;re assuming the Z Flip 7 will provide slightly better processing power, but more testing will be required to suss out the differences. A similar chip, the Exynos 2400e, in the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE resulted in slightly lower performance than the Samsung Galaxy S24 (running 2023\u0026#39;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip) \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/samsung-galaxy-s24-vs-s24-fe-is-the-higher-end-phone-the-better-value/\" target=\"_self\"\u003ein our versus testing\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCrucially, both phones should have enough memory to support AI tools -- the Z Flip 7 FE is straddling the line with 8GB of RAM -- which is an important benchmark for any new phone right now. The Z Flip 7 comes with 12GB of RAM, so it has stronger support for the integrated AI tools.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf storing photos and downloading apps and games is something you do often, the Z Flip 7 has the edge over the Z Flip 7 FE. The Z Flip 7 starts at 256GB of storage with pricier models featuring a fairly large 512GB, whereas the Z Flip 7 FE starts with 128GB of storage and caps out at 256GB of space.
