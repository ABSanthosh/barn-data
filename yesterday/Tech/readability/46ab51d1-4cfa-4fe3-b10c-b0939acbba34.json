  "text": "Gus Moreno, author of the (very good, must-read) 2021 horror novel This Thing Between Us, has teamed up with artist Jakub Rebelka for a new comic series following an exorcist with unconventional methods and the disgraced priest who has been made his apprentice. In an Instagram post ahead of its release, Moreno said of the series, “If you ever saw an exorcism movie and thought, this could use more Tarantino references, this is the comic for you.” Yeah, I’m in. The first of its five issues was released this week, diving right in with a murder, an exorcism and a strange hospital visit. It’s mostly setting up the story that has yet to unfold — cuing us in on Father Manuel Barrera’s downfall and reassignment to Puerto Cristina, the world’s southernmost city, as a trainee under Father Merrick Stygian — but it’s definitely got me intrigued. I really like the art style, especially how grotesque the characters’ facial features are at times.",
