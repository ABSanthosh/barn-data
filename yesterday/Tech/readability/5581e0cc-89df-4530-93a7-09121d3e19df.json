  "text": "Partnering with the Shawnee Tribe for Civilization VIIEst. Read Time2 minutes, 4 secondsWith each Civilization title, we take great care to thoughtfully and authentically portray every culture on our roster of civilizations and leaders. During the development of Civilization VII, Firaxis Games reached out to Ben Barnes, chief of the Shawnee Tribe, to discuss the possibility of incorporating Shawnee history into the game. By chance, Chief Barnes is a longtime fan of strategy games, including the Civilization series, and these conversations eventually blossomed into an ongoing relationship of shared knowledge and resources which not only led to more accurate and meaningful in-game depictions, but also real gains in preserving Shawnee language and culture for future generations.In 2021, the team at Firaxis began working with the Tribe to make sure the in-game Shawnee civilization* and the visionary leader Tecumseh*—who is included in Civ VII's expansive roster of playable leaders, voiced by Shawnee actor Dillon Dean—were respectfully represented. In addition to faithfully incorporating the Shawnee language in-game, the developers researched archeological material, studied old family photographs, and consulted with cultural knowledge-keepers while carefully shaping how the Tribe was characterized.Then, in February 2025, the next phase of our collaboration culminated in the grand opening of the George \"Fife\" Blanchard Yaatakciitonooteeki (Recording Studio) in Miami, Oklahoma. Paying homage to George Blanchard, a fluent Shawnee language speaker and visionary leader in his own right, the studio is fully equipped to produce audio recordings of the highest quality and support the Tribe's ongoing preservation efforts. The Shawnee Tribe is almost halfway through its \"Decade of the Shawnee Language,\" and this new space will significantly bolster their work.Of course, it also warmed our hearts to see Chief Ben Barnes as thrilled as we are to showcase the Shawnee in Civilization VII. It's been an honor to work alongside the Tribe in this fulfilling partnership, and now that the game has launched worldwide, we can't wait for more players to build something they believe in while embodying Tecumseh and leading the Shawnee in Civ VII for years to come!*Tecumseh leader and Shawnee civilization are part of the Tecumseh and Shawnee Pack DLC. The Tecumseh and Shawnee Pack is included in the Deluxe and Founders Editions of Civilization VII. It will also be available for separate purchase starting April 15, 2025 (base game required, date subject to change).",
