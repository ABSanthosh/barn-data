  "description": "Amazon is acquiring Bee, a startup that makes a $49.99 AI-powered wearable that passively listens to conversations and generates personalized summaries and suggestions. \"You can also give the device permission to access your emails, contacts, location, reminders, photos, and calendar events to help inform its AI-generated insights, as well as create a searchable history of your activities,\" adds The Verge. From the report: When asked about Amazon's plans to apply the same privacy measures offered by Bee, such as its policy against storing audio, Amazon spokesperson Alexandra Miller says the company \"cares deeply\" about customer privacy and security, adding that the company will work with Bee to give users \"even greater control over\" their devices when the deal closes. \"We've been strong stewards of customer data since our founding, and have never been in the business of selling our customers' personal information to others,\" Miller says. \"We design our products to protect our customers' privacy and security and to make it easy for them to be in control of their experience -- and this approach would of course apply to Bee.\" Miller also says the terms of the deal are \"confidential,\" and all Bee employees have \"received offers to join Amazon.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
