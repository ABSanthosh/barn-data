  "text": "Prepare yourselves, My Hero Academia watchers: the final season will kick off sometime in October. During this weekend’s AnimeJapan in Tokyo, Toho released a small teaser announcing the release month for season eight. In it, the series’ respective main hero and villain, Deku and Tomura Shigaraki, have split narration on their goals and whose story this has been all along. Deku and the rest of Japan’s hero community have been at war against Shigaraki, All for One, and the other villains under their command, and last season ended with big shakeups on both sides, with several key players in the war either dead or out of commission. The My Hero Academia manga ended in 2024 after 430 chapters and an epilogue that December. Creator Kohei Horikoshi hasn’t said anything about his next project since putting a bow on the superhero series, but he has drawn plenty of great art for its characters in the past year. Before the main anime ends, fans can get their fix in the upcoming spinoff, Vigilantes. That show, set five years before Deku’s story, focuses on non-licensed heroes saving their city and crossing paths with young versions of supporting characters like Mirko and Eraserhead. It’s set to premiere April 7, so you definitely won’t be short on My Hero material throughout 2025. Want more io9 news? Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what’s next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who.",
