  "text": "Apple fell slightly short of investor expectations when it reported its first-quarter earnings today. While sales were up 4 percent overall, the iPhone showed signs of weakness, and sales in the Chinese market slipped by just over 11 percent. CEO Tim Cook told CNBC that the iPhone performed better in countries where Apple Intelligence was available, like the US—seemingly suggesting that the slip was partially because Chinese consumers do not see enough reason to buy new phones without Apple Intelligence. (He also said, \"Half of the decline is due to a change in channel inventory.\") iPhone sales also slipped in China during this same quarter last year; this was the first full quarter during which the iPhone 16 was available. In any case, Cook said the company plans to roll out Apple Intelligence in additional languages, including Mandarin, this spring. Apple's wearables category also declined slightly, but only by 2 percent. Despite the trends that worried investors, Apple reported $36.33 billion in net revenue for the first quarter. That's 7.1 percent more than last year's Q1. This was driven by the Mac, the iPad, and Services (which includes everything from Apple Music to iCloud)—all of which saw slight upticks in sales. Services was up 14 percent, continuing a strong streak for that business, while the Mac and the iPad both jumped up 15 percent. The uptick in Mac and iPad sales was likely helped by several new Mac models and a new iPad mini starting shipments last October. Cook shared some other interesting numbers in the earnings call with investors and the press: The company has an active base of 2.35 billion devices, and it has more than 1 billion active subscriptions.",
