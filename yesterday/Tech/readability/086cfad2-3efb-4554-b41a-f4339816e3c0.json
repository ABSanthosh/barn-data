  "text": "The Yale Smart Lock with Matter is launching tomorrow, June 24th, for $189.99 — $20 more than when it was first announced in March. Yale tells The Verge the price increase is due to the impact of tariffs. The lock will be available on Amazon and Yale’s website.According to Yale, the new smart lock was built for Google Home and Matter and designed specifically to complement Google Home’s Nest video doorbells. However, thanks to its Matter-over-Thread connectivity, it can work with multiple smart home platforms, including Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, and Home Assistant.In a briefing, Catelyn Herman, senior product manager at Yale, told The Verge that “tariff costs and overall product costs led us to have to increase the price slightly.” All the other features are the same as when it was first announced, which is also when Yale confirmed it had discontinued the two companies’ previous collab: the Next x Yale lock. The new Yale Smart Lock with Matter comes in white, black, and, this fall, gray. It has a promised 12 months of battery life on 4 AAs, thanks to Matter-over-Thread connectivity, which should also provide faster response times compared to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth locks. It’s one of a growing number of full-deadbolt replacement locks that use the new protocol; others include Kwikset’s Halo Select, Level Lock Plus, Eufy E30, U-tec’s Matter lock, and Yale’s Assure SL.Several control methods are available, including inputting a code on its backlit push-button keypad and using a key. You can lock and unlock it remotely using the Google Home app (as well as other Matter-apps) and with your voice control via Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Apple’s Siri. Jesse Stroh, product manager at Google Home and Nest, confirmed that you can now unlock Matter locks using a voice PIN code via Google Assistant. Unlike the Nest x Yale lock that could disarm Google’s Nest Secure security system, the new lock won’t integrate with any security system at launch, which is surprising considering both Yale and Google’s close relationship with home security company ADT. Unlike Yale’s other locks – including the Yale Assure 2 line – the Yale Smart Lock doesn’t have an auto-unlock function, just auto-lock. The lock also features a keyway, which the Nest x Yale didn’t. Herman says Yale’s research shows that a push button and a keyed option are what most people prefer. I’m on board with the push buttons, but I think these locks would look much sleeker without the keyhole.The lock can work with any platform that supports Matter, but Stroh said it has a “best in class integration with the Google Home platform.” He said it’s able to take “full advantage of the Matter features Google Home supports.”These currently include creating and editing codes for the lock, including guest codes with set schedules. You can also view lock activity in the Home app’s activity feed and get lock and unlock notifications, said Stroh, adding that current Google Nest doorbells will integrate with the lock so you can control it while viewing a live feed from the doorbell.Based on my experience using Matter-enabled locks in Apple Home and Samsung SmartThings, you should get these same features on those platforms as well. But, while it will work with other platforms, it’s clearly designed to appeal to Google Home users. Although those who are looking to upgrade from the Nest x Yale lock may not be thrilled with the new look. The white and gray may match the Google Nest doorbells, but without the options of rubbed bronze or satin nickel that the Nest had, it’s not going to match your existing door hardware.One benefit of the new lock is that you can set it up directly in the Google Home app (or other Matter app) without needing to use the Yale app. However, as a Matter-over-Thread device, it does require a Matter controller and a Thread border router; the Matter hub needs to be a Google one if you want to use it in the Google Home app. Without these, you can control the lock using the Yale Home app over Bluetooth, something Yale’s other Matter-over-Thread lock, the Yale Assure SL, didn’t offer. But this only works when you’re in range, i.e., at home, as there’s no built-in Wi-Fi.The lock can work over Wi-Fi with Yale’s $90 Wi-Fi Connect bridge, but I wouldn’t buy that just to use this lock. You’re better off picking up something like the Google TV Streamer for $95 to get the Thread connectivity, Google Home Matter hub, and a good streaming box. I plan to review the Yale Smart Lock soon.",

doesn’t have an auto-unlock function, just auto-lock. The lock also features a keyway, which the Nest x Yale didn’t. Herman says Yale’s research shows that a push button and a keyed option are what most people prefer. I’m on board with the push buttons, but I think these locks would look much sleeker without the keyhole.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe lock can work with any platform that supports Matter, but Stroh said it has a “best in class integration with the Google Home platform.” He said it’s able to take “full advantage of the \u003ca href=\"https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/15711196\"\u003eMatter features Google Home supports\u003c/a\u003e.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese currently include creating and editing codes for the lock, including guest codes with set schedules. You can also view lock activity in the Home app’s activity feed and get lock and unlock notifications, said Stroh, adding that current Google Nest doorbells will integrate with the lock so you can control it while viewing a live feed from the doorbell.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBased on my experience using Matter-enabled locks in Apple Home and Samsung SmartThings, you should get these same features on those platforms as well. But, while it will work with other platforms, it’s clearly designed to appeal to Google Home users. Although those who are looking to upgrade from the Nest x Yale lock may not be thrilled with the new look. The white and gray may match the Google Nest doorbells, but without the \u003ca href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homedepot.com%2Fpep%2FGoogle-Nest-x-Yale-Lock-Tamper-Proof-Smart-Deadbolt-Lock-with-Nest-Connect-Oil-Rubbed-Bronze-RB-YRD540-WV-0BP%2F304517968%3Fsource%3Dshoppingads%26locale%3Den-US%26pla%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dvantage%26utm_campaign%3D50540%26utm_content%3D52807%26mtc%3DSHOPPING-RM-RMP-GGL-Multi-Multi-NA-GOOGLE-NA-PMAX-NA-NA-MK890779001-50540-NBR-3422-NA-VNT-FY25_Q1_Q4_Google_D27_D26_AON%26cm_mmc%3DSHOPPING-RM-RMP-GGL-Multi-Multi-NA-GOOGLE-NA-PMAX-NA-NA-MK890779001-50540-NBR-3422-NA-VNT-FY25_Q1_Q4_Google_D27_D26_AON-22175487036--%26gad_source%3D1%26gad_campaignid%3D22181892710%26gbraid%3D0AAAAAolLu9-P7I55ifM02-03T7AniAa-u%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjw9uPCBhATEiwABHN9K3KPdh0H5AwRQKBqq_S-9m3KXWYMXC0zzvGaIQSmKZqpyxSG7fa0DBoCZukQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds\" rel=\"sponsored\"\u003eoptions of rubbed bronze or satin nickel\u003c/a\u003e that the Nest had, it’s not going to match your existing door hardware.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne benefit of the new lock is that you can set it up directly in the Google Home app (or other Matter app) without needing to use the Yale app. However, as a \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23823041/matter-thread-device-setup-smart-home-how-to\"\u003eMatter-over-Thread device\u003c/a\u003e, it does require a \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23568091/matter-compatible-devices-accessories-apple-amazon-google-samsung#:~:text=Tuohy%20/%20The%20Verge-,Getting%20started%3A%20Matter%20controllers,-To%20use%20Matter\"\u003eMatter controller and a Thread border router\u003c/a\u003e; the Matter hub needs to be a Google one if you want to use it in the Google Home app. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWithout these, you can control the lock using the Yale Home app over Bluetooth, something Yale’s other Matter-over-Thread lock, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23393163/best-smart-door-lock#:~:text=The%20Yale%20Assure%20SL,work%20with%20Yale%E2%80%99s%20app.\"\u003eYale Assure SL\u003c/a\u003e, didn’t offer.
