  "text": "Recently, the charm of Labubu made its way onto my social feed with friends sharing their new companion accessory, a tiny nine-toothed fuzzy monster keychain plush as an adornment on their purses or backpacks. As fandom and fashion evolves, the latest trend is to personalize your daily carry-ons with charms, and right now none are more popular than Pop Mart’s x Kasing Lung’s The Monsters, with their slate of whimsical Labubu elven playful entities. Creator and picture book artist Kasing Lung was inspired by Nordic mythology about enchanted forest elves while creating his Labubu characters. As a fantasy creature mark, I have found myself drawn in to the toy collector space, but have also been tempted by Pop Mart’s Disney collabs too. Their appeal to me was based off the deeply adorable Henson Creature shop aesthetic mixed with Where the Wild Things Are vibes by way of Donnie Darko‘s Frank the Bunny. Labubu taps into a visceral nostalgia of child-like make-believe I haven’t felt in a while. I’d seen one of my dearest friends, a devoted K-pop fan, post hers in various photos on her red carpet and concert adventures. Initially, I believed it must be a K-pop thing—and to an extent the craze did receive a swell of fans thanks to Blackpink singer and The White Lotus star Lalisa accessorizing her designer bags with her collection of Labubus from the “Exciting Macaron” and “Have a Seat” drops, which she recently showed off to Vanity Fair. The curiosity was there and I was getting alerts that more Pop Mart locations were opening up soon, so I hoped to maybe take a peek eventually. © Pop Mart So I hesitated but watched from afar. My interest grew further when another spooky kawaii-invested friend messaged me about her hunt for one too. I lived vicariously through her journey, encountering sold-out Pop Mart queues on the official website and immediate drops at locations which only had them momentarily available on online pre-order. This was necessary, in order to avoid customers having any potential misunderstanding or delays if the shop dared to put them out on the floor; an employee at my local Pop Mart confirmed this when I called around to see if any were available to buy. Labubus, like the mischievous creatures that inspired them, make only limited appearances before being quickly snatched up. Fantasy folklore and fandom fashion collided and I was in. The need to know more grew and I dove into YouTube videos to discover as much as I could (Lalisa’s video helped the most). There’s little bits of character stories pieced together about the relationships between the Labubus, how the main character is Labubu but she is also a Labubu (think Toad from Mario Bros.), and they come in different plush sizes that inspire mad cuteness aggression. Combine that with Pop Mart’s blind box itch and that’s a dangerous combo. But it was probably finding out that Labubus have their own land in a Pop Mart theme park (that I need to go to!) which really cinched the deal. I write about theme parks and love fantasy monsters… let’s freakin’ go. Listening to my friends’ different journeys to find their coveted Labubu inspired a weekend trip to the mall to check the Pop Mart vending machine and retailers I was familiar with having product. Storefronts were taped off with customers queuing to get in and shelves were empty. My spooky-cute collector friend started researching how to verify a legitimate Labubu from a third party seller. When io9 talked to the blind box toy titan about this approach, the official line is “Pop Mart can’t officially comment on third-party purchases” and “the best way to guarantee your Labubu is authentic is by purchasing directly from Pop Mart retail stores,” but a quick TikTok search could assist your search if you exercise caution. The hunt for these elusive cute creatures is that serious as with any collector item. As someone who grew up hanging out at the mall and still can’t grow out of weekend trips to get my steps in, I attempted multiple times at various places to get my hands on an “Exciting Macaron” plush keychain blind box. I encountered toy islands charging an outrageous $30 for the sought-after boxes, which was the first red flag of many—including differences in the boxing, which online searches suggest are clear warning signs of a fake. Meanwhile mall mainstays known for selling Pop Mart products, have begun to mark up their inventory from $45 to $70, as opposed to the cost of $21.99 straight from the source. After weeks of constant “sold out” notifications—likely from the bot-fueled frenzy of flippers—I stood before a Pop Mart, contemplating my next move. I walked in and looked at Labubus on display with little digital signs reading “out of stock.” Defeated, I went to get a tea latte at a coffee stand where the employees displayed Labubu stickers; they may have directed me to a shop where boxes were available for $45, and I may have caved. But until I get my hands on a Labubu straight from the source, I won’t know if I got the real deal or not. So now I’m eagerly waiting for the next drop so I can finally get some peace of mind—and proudly display a chaotically cute creature companion on my arm, too. Want more io9 news?
