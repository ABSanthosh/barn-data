The Floridians form hasn't been great coming into today's game, with Javier Mascherano's team currently sitting third in the MLS Eastern Conference after a run of just four wins from their last 12 games across all competitions. Al Ahly, meanwhile, secured a record-extending 45th Egyptian Premier League title last month and come into this tournament opener having won their last six competitive matches. The prolific Wessam Abou Ali is the Red Devils' key man, with the Palestinian striker having scored eight goals in Al Ahly's last six matches. Al Ahly take on Inter Miami on Saturday, June 14, at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, with kickoff set for 8 p.m. ET or 5 p.m. PT. That makes it a 1 a.m. BST start in the UK and a 10 a.m. AEST kickoff in Australia on Sunday.  With Cristiano Ronaldo not appearing in this summer's tournament, Inter Miami's Lionel Messi has the chance to surpass the Portuguese star's record for most FIFA Club World Cup goals. Messi has scored five goals in five Club World Cup appearances -- just two behind Ronaldo's tally. CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images Livestream the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 for freeThe great news for footy fans is that sports streaming platform DAZN is set to broadcast all 63 matches of the FIFA Club World Cup free in almost every country, with coverage available in multiple languages.

How to watch Al Ahly vs. Inter Miami online from anywhere using a VPNIf you're traveling abroad and want to keep up with all the FIFA Club World Cup soccer action while away from home, a VPN can help enhance your privacy and security when streaming. It encrypts your traffic and prevents your internet service provider from throttling your speeds and can also be helpful when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks while traveling, adding an extra layer of protection for your devices and logins. VPNs are legal in many countries, including the US and Canada, and can be used for legitimate purposes such as improving online privacy and security. However, some streaming services may have policies restricting VPN use to access region-specific content. If you're considering a VPN for streaming, check the platform's terms of service to ensure compliance. If you choose to use a VPN, follow the provider's installation instructions, ensuring you're connected securely and in compliance with applicable laws and service agreements. Some streaming platforms may block access when a VPN is detected, so verifying if your streaming subscription allows VPN use is crucial.

It's normally $13 a month but if you sign up for an annual subscription for $100 you'll get three months free and save 49%. That's the equivalent of $6.67 a month.Note that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee. 61% off with 2yr plan (+4 free months) Livestream Al Ahly vs. Inter Miami free in the UKAs well as DAZN, footy fans in the UK have a second option for watching FIFA Club World Cup matches that is also free.Free-to-air broadcaster Channel 5 is set to show 23 select features live during the tournament, including today's tournament opener. That also means this match can be live streamed via the network's My5 online service.

Quick tips for streaming FIFA Club World Cup 2025 soccer using a VPN With four variables at play -- your ISP, browser, video streaming provider and VPN -- your experience and success when streaming soccer may vary.If you don't see your desired location as a default option for ExpressVPN, try using the \"search for city or country\" option.If you're having trouble getting the game after you've turned on your VPN and set it to the correct viewing area, there are two things you can try for a quick fix. First, log into your streaming service subscription account and make sure the address registered for the account is an address in the correct viewing area. If not, you may need to change the physical address on file with your account. Second, some smart TVs -- like Roku -- don't have VPN apps you can install directly on the device itself. Instead, you'll have to install the VPN on your router or the mobile hotspot you're using (like your phone) so that any device on its Wi-Fi network now appears in the correct viewing location.All of the VPN providers we recommend have helpful instructions on their main site for quickly installing the VPN on your router. In some cases with smart TV services, after you install a cable network's sports app, you'll be asked to verify a numeric code or click a link sent to your email address on file for your smart TV. This is where having a VPN on your router will also help, because both devices will appear to be in the correct location. And remember, browsers can often give away a location despite using a VPN, so be sure you're using a privacy-first browser to log into your services. We normally recommend Brave. Other Services \u0026 Software",

First, log into your streaming service subscription account and make sure the address registered for the account is an address in the correct viewing area. If not, you may need to change the physical address on file with your account. Second, some smart TVs -- like Roku -- don\u0026#39;t have VPN apps you can install directly on the device itself. Instead, you\u0026#39;ll have to install the VPN on your router or the mobile hotspot you\u0026#39;re using (like your phone) so that any device on its Wi-Fi network now appears in the correct viewing location.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAll of the VPN providers we recommend have helpful instructions on their main site for quickly installing the VPN on your router. In some cases with smart TV services, after you install a cable network\u0026#39;s sports app, you\u0026#39;ll be asked to verify a numeric code or click a link sent to your email address on file for your smart TV. This is where having a VPN on your router will also help, because both devices will appear to be in the correct location. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnd remember, browsers can often give away a location despite using a VPN, so be sure you\u0026#39;re using a privacy-first browser to log into your services.
