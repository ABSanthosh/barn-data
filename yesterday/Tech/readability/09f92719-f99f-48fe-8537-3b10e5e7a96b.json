  "text": "Prime Video’s Invincible has been steadily going through a number of well-worn superhero stories and putting its own, usually bloody spin on things. After the previous two seasons tackled plots like the standard origin story, a team of newbies stepping up, and the multiverse, season three is going for kid proteges and heroes vs. their shady government pals. After accidentally killing Angstrom Levy, Mark’s back to working with Cecil and focusing on being his best, superheroic self. Just when it seems he’s got a handle on things, he’s not too happy to learn Cecil’s made D.A. Sinclair produce his Reanimen to fight off the eventual Viltrumite invasion. Things eventually come to a head when Cecil decides to try and put Mark in his place, but Mark won’t make it easy for him. Like in previous Invincible trailers, everyone’s either tearing through their enemies or getting their own shit rocked. The only one without much fighting spirit is Omni-Man, who’s in Viltrumite prison up in space, and not looking to partner up with Allen the Alien to bust out and go against his own people. https://youtu.be/rbHUhCcSXEM Mark won’t just have to contend with Cecil and Sinclair this season. His half-brother Oliver has decided to join the family business as a superhero. He’s as much of a powerhouse as his dad and brother, but a little too eager, so it falls to Mark to help him become more than a one-kid wrecking machine. And it looks like he’ll need it, since a big-ass dragon, Dupli-Kate’s evil brother, and the Mauler Twins are some of the other big threats to Earth. Invincible’s third season hits Prime Video with its first three episodes on February 6, 2025, followed by a new one every week until March 13. Want more io9 news?
