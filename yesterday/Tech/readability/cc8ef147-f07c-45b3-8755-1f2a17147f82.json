  "text": "Humane, which makes the not-great AI Pin, wants other companies to build AI devices and gadgets that use its CosmOS operating system, and it has released a video that appears to show that the company already has it working in a car, TV, smart speaker, and phone.But note that the video, according to Humane’s own fine print, is for “illustrative purposes only” — it shows “working prototypes” and some “simulated experiences,” and the print says that all “designs, features, and specifications” are subject to change. So don’t take it entirely at face value.In one example, the video shows a person talking to CosmOS in their car (with a blurred out logo on the steering wheel) to turn the heat up at their house and figure out what time people are coming over. They ask their (blurred out) smart speaker about a guacamole recipe, and their TV about how many goals a soccer player onscreen has scored. The video also shows CosmOS reading an email on the person’s phone and responding to a question about whether the person can attend a meeting.If you’ve been following recent AI hype, especially around agents, none of these examples should feel particularly novel — Humane wants to demonstrate that CosmOS is capable of powerful agent-like capabilities, and for companies to consider it as a possible backbone for their devices. But the items in this video aren’t Humane’s own products, and Humane clearly isn’t promising to make them. It’s building an SDK for others to do so.That CosmOS SDK isn’t available publicly yet — the company’s website only says that it’s “coming soon,” though you can click a button to “sign up to build with us,” which takes you to a form to fill out. Humane doesn’t mention any partners building devices that rely on CosmOS — the blurred-out logos on the car and smart speaker suggest the company may have not gotten that far yet. We’ve asked Humane if it can share any examples.Humane may be looking for a new line of business after the AI Pin flopped; we reported in August that daily returns of the device were outpacing sales. The product initially launched in April, but the company dropped the price of the Pin just six months later. Earlier this year, Humane was reportedly looking for a buyer, with HP at one point being a contender.",
