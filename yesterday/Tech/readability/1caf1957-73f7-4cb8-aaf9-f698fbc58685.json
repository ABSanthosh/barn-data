  "text": "Apr 29, 2025 [[read-time]] min read ID passes are coming to the U.K. and we are expanding mobile IDs to more U.S. states with more places you can use them. Today we're introducing updates that help you prove your age and identity in a safe and secure way, right from your phone.ID passes arriving in the U.K.Residents of the United Kingdom will soon be able to create digital ID passes with their U.K. passports and securely and conveniently store them in Google Wallet. At launch, we’re partnering with Rail Delivery Group, which will offer train travellers the opportunity to use their digital ID to verify that they meet the eligibility criteria for select Railcards on its Railcard retailing platform railcard.co.uk. We’re also exploring certification within the digital identity trust framework of the U.K.’s Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, which could allow residents to use their Google Wallet ID passes for alcohol purchases and more.Digital IDs come to more U.S. states and servicesResidents in Arkansas, Montana, Puerto Rico and West Virginia will soon be able to save their government-issued digital IDs to Google Wallet. And in Arizona, Georgia, Maryland and New Mexico, users will also be able to use their mobile IDs at the DMV for improved and streamlined customer experiences.With the REAL ID deadline approaching on May 7, 2025, you can use your ID pass created from a U.S. passport with TSA security for domestic travel at supported airports, even if you do not have a REAL ID driver's license or state-issued ID. ID passes created from U.K. passports are not currently eligible for use at TSA security. Note that ID pass is not a replacement for your physical ID so keep that with you as needed.New use cases are on the way in collaboration with our strong partner ecosystem. Soon, you'll be able to use your digital ID to recover Amazon accounts, access online health services with CVS and MyChart by Epic, verify profiles on platforms like Uber and more.Fast and private age verificationGiven many sites and services require age verification, we wanted to develop a system that not only verifies age, but does it in a way that protects your privacy. That's why we are integrating Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology into Google Wallet, further ensuring there is no way to link the age back to your identity. This implementation allows us to provide speedy age verification across a wide range of mobile devices, apps and websites that use our Digital Credential API.We will use ZKP where appropriate in other Google products and partner with apps like Bumble, which will use digital IDs from Google Wallet to verify user identity and ZKP to verify age. To help foster a safer, more secure environment for everyone, we will also open source our ZKP technology to other wallets and online services.Google Wallet will launch in 50 more countriesWe're also expanding Google Wallet to 50 more countries, allowing users to view and use digital passes in the app and on the web. This update brings the security and convenience of Google Wallet to countries where tap to pay is not yet available.",
