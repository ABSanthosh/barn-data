  "description": "The BBC brings news from the Baltic Sea. After critical undersea cables were damaged or severed last year, \"NATO has launched a new mission to increase the surveillance of ships...\" Undersea infrastructure is essential not only for electricity supply but also because more than 95% of internet traffic is secured via undersea cables, [said NATO head Mark Rutte], adding that \"1.3 million kilometres (800,000 miles) of cables guarantee an estimated 10 trillion-dollar worth of financial transactions every day\". In a post on X, he said Nato would do \"what it takes to ensure the safety and security of our critical infrastructure and all that we hold dear\".... Estonia's Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said in December that damage to submarine infrastructure had become \"so frequent\" that it cast doubt on the idea the damage could be considered \"accidental\" or \"merely poor seamanship\". The article also has new details about a late-December cable-cutting by the Eagle S (which was then boarded by Finland's coast guard and steered into Finnish waters). \"On Monday, Risto Lohi of Finland's National Bureau of Investigation told Reuters that the Eagle S was threatening to cut a second power cable and a gas pipe between Finland and Estonia at the time it was seized.\" And there's reports that the ship was loaded with spying equipment. NATO's new surveillance of the Baltic Sea will include \"uncrewed surface vessels,\" according to defense-news web site TWZ.com: The uncrewed surface vessels [or USVs], also known as drone boats, will help establish an enhanced common operating picture to give participating nations a better sense of potential threats and speed up any response. It is the first time NATO will use USVs in this manner, said a top alliance commander... There will be at least 20 USVs assigned [a NATO spokesman told The War Zone Friday]... In the first phase of the experiment, the USVs will \"have the capabilities under human control\" while \"later phases will include greater autonomy.\" The USVs will augment the dozen or so vessels as well as an unspecified number of crewed maritime patrol aircraft committed One highly-placed NATO official tells the site that within weeks \"we will begin to use these ships to give a persistent, 24-7 surveillance of critical areas.\" Last week the U.K. government also announced \"an advanced UK-led reaction system to track potential threats to undersea infrastructure and monitor the Russian shadow fleet.\" The system \"harnesses AI to assess data from a range of sources, including the Automatic Identification System (AIS) ships use to broadcast their position, to calculate the risk posed by each vessel entering areas of interest.\" Harnessing the power of AI, this UK-led system is a major innovation which allows us the unprecedented ability to monitor large areas of the sea with a comparatively small number of resources, helping us stay secure at home and strong abroad.
