Now, you can make mind maps to see how ideas connect, find helpful study materials right inside NotebookLM, and even understand complicated PDFs with pictures and graphs. NotebookLM is like a study buddy that helps you learn in a way that works for you. Summaries were generated by Google AI. Generative AI is experimental. As exam season approaches, we know students are looking for ways they can prepare. Many NotebookLM users, including students and educational institutions, already value it for studying and learning. Tens of thousands of schools use NotebookLM for study assistance, writing support, research, and interactive learning with Audio Overviews.Today we’re announcing a suite of new features we’ve been gradually rolling out, designed specifically to help students tackle their upcoming finals. 1. Visualize connections with the new Mind Map feature.Understanding complex topics is easier when you see how ideas relate. NotebookLM's new Mind Map feature generates interactive visual diagrams to help you grasp the overall structure of your sources and notes and connect seemingly unrelated concepts. You can easily zoom in on specific areas and click concepts to get summaries about any topic within the mind map. Based on user feedback, we believe this visual approach can significantly enhance comprehension and retention of even the most challenging information and is another quick way to get on top of a new subject. 2. Discover new study materials directly within NotebookLM.Yesterday, we introduced a new way to find and add web sources in NotebookLM. This feature especially helps students, as finding the right, comprehensive set of resources for a specific subject or topic is a crucial first step in studying effectively. NotebookLM can now help you discover high-quality background information, explore research papers and more, all within your focused workflow. 3. Understand complex PDFs full of images and graphs.We’ve listened to your feedback requesting support for more document types. We’ve made significant improvements to how NotebookLM understands PDFs, and starting today, it will recognize all content within them, including expanded support for images and graphs for PDFs added as links, and over the next few days, for all PDFs directly uploaded.Understand anything with NotebookLMThese new features make NotebookLM a comprehensive study companion, helping you gather information efficiently, understand complex topics, and learn effectively in a way that best suits your individual needs.Plus, educators and administrators can have peace of mind about using NotebookLM in their institutions. That’s because, as of today, NotebookLM has enterprise-grade data protection for education. As a Core Service, it’s covered under the existing Workspace for Education terms, supporting compliance with industry regulations, like FERPA.So, as you gear up for your final exams, take advantage of these powerful new capabilities in NotebookLM. We’re confident they’ll help you achieve your academic goals.",
