  "description": "It's been a rough week at Microsoft. Following the news that 9,000 people are being laid off at the company, one Xbox executive offered some questionable words of advice for people on their way out: Find solace in Microsoft Copilot. As reported by Aftermath, Matt Turnbull, an executive producer at Xbox Game Studios Publishing who clearly did not lose his job recently, took to LinkedIn to let folks know, \"You're not alone and you don't have to go it alone.\" In the same breath as acknowledging that AI evokes \"strong feelings in people,\" Turnbull suggested that LLMs like ChatGPT and Copilot could \"help reduce the emotional and cognitive load that comes with job loss.\"  Turnbull went on to provide specific AI prompts that he recommended for recently laid-off people, including, \"Write a warm intro message for reaching out to someone at [studio name] about a job posting.\" He explained how an LLM could aid overwhelmed developers in planning their careers and punching up their resumés, and also help with \"emotional clarity and confidence.\" The post was circulated on Bluesky by Necrosoft Games director and Insert Credit host Brandon Sheffield, where it received a predictably negative reaction. According to Video Games Chronicle, LinkedIn users were similarly unimpressed. Turnbull deleted the post a few hours later. Here's the full text from the LinkedIn post: These are really challenging times, and if you're navigating a layoff or even quietly preparing for one, you're not alone and you don't have to go it alone. I know these types of tools engender strong feelings in people, but I'd be remiss in not trying to offer the best advice I can under the circumstances. I've been experimenting with ways to use LLM Al tools (like ChatGPT or Copilot) to help reduce the emotional and cognitive load that comes with job loss. Here are some prompt ideas and use cases that might help if you're feeling overwhelmed: Career Planning Prompts:\"Act as a career coach. I've been laid off from a [role] in the game industry. Help me build a 30-day plan to regroup, research new roles, and start applying without burning out.\"\"What kinds of game industry jobs could I pivot to with experience in [Production/Narrative/LiveOps/etc.]?\" Resume \u0026 Linkedin Help\"Here's my current resume. Give me three tailored versions: one for AAA, one for platform/publishing roles, and one for startup/small studio leadership.\"\"Rewrite this resume bullet to highlight impact and metrics.\"\"Draft a new LinkedIn 'About Me' section that focuses on my leadership style, shipped titles, and vision for game development.\" Networking \u0026 Outreach\"Draft a friendly message I can send to old coworkers letting them know I'm exploring new opportunities.\"\"Write a warm intro message for reaching out to someone at [studio name] about a job posting.\" Emotional Clarity \u0026 Confidence\"I'm struggling with imposter syndrome after being laid off. Can you help me reframe this experience in a way that reminds me what I'm good at?\" No Al tool is a replacement for your voice or your lived experience. But at a time when mental energy is scarce, these tools can help get you unstuck faster, calmer, and with more clarity. If this helps, feel free to share with others in your network. Stay kind, stay smart, stay connected. Turnbull's post, however earnest, comes at a time when Microsoft is seemingly all-in on both AI and layoffs. The 9,000 job losses this week add to over 6,000 announced in May. Microsoft President Brad Smith began 2025 by committing to spend around $80 billion on AI infrastructure through the year, and CEO Satya Nadella recently shared that a large portion of his company's code is now authored by AI.  Just last week, Business Insider reported on another executive telling employees that using Copilot is \"no longer optional\" in an internal memo. One developer at Halo Studios, which was affected by the layoffs, told Engadget's Jessica Conditt that they felt Xbox leadership was looking to \"replace as many jobs as they can with AI agents.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/how-ai-can-help-you-navigate-layoffs-according-to-one-executive-producer-at-xbox-210008717.html?src=rss",
