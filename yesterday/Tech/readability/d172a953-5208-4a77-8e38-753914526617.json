He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.Someone has responded to YouTuber Mark Rober’s Tesla fake wall test with a video that also tries to address the question of whether the company’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) features would detect a Wile E. Coyote-style road obstruction in the real world. Creator Kyle Paul posted his video Thursday and included two Teslas with FSD: a Model Y equipped with a HW3 computer and a Cybertruck that comes with the latest HW4 / AI4 system and cameras, Not a Tesla App reports.In the original video, Rober, an engineer who went viral after his package thief glitter bombs videos, tested whether Tesla’s camera-based Full Self-Driving (FSD) system can automatically stop before plowing through a wall painted as a road stretching into the horizon. It didn’t, people raised (many) questions, and we tried to answer a few of them.In Paul’s video, the Tesla Model Y with confirmed FSD (in this case, version 12.5.4.2) didn’t fare better than Rober’s — he had to manually stop the vehicle before it crashed into the fake wall that, to my human eyes, doesn’t look quite as convincing. Not all is lost for Tesla, though, as Paul’s test of the Cybertruck with FSD version 13.2.8 had a better ending. It detected the wall and slowed down to a complete stop.You can watch both videos for yourself, whether it’s to check the science or just to take note of how many people have the means to build real-world Looney Tunes ACME walls.",
