  "text": "CES Follow along with the Gizmodo crew as we take you on a by-the-minute tour of new tech on display at the annual Consumer Electronics Show. © Gizmodo TVs? AI? Robots? Anthropomorphized robot lawnmowers? The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) has it all—and sometimes too much of it. We’ve got boots on the ground at the year’s biggest tech event to wade through what’s relevant and interesting, no matter how unnecessary it might seem. We’ll also highlight some of the weird, tacky, and weird-enough-it-just-might-work. Some companies have already debuted their wares before the show floor opens up. LG’s new three-in-one lamp-projector is an interesting amalgamation of devices for the living room, while Govee released a set of new pixel-ish gaming lights to make GIFs come to life. This robot vacuum is also piquing our interest because it does what other robot vacuums can’t, which is sprout a claw arm to pick up wayward objects. There’s much more to come, including major announcements from the industry’s biggest chipmakers and a whole lineup of new laptops and computers to consider shopping for later this year. Check back here for the most up-to-date news and hands-on impressions. Jan 10CES Impressed This Year After All © Gizmodo That’s it! The live blog has ended. Thank you so much to everyone who stuck with us this week, clicked through for updates, and followed along as we brought you the weirdest, wackiest, and most relevant news from the enchanted land of Las Vegas. To start 2025, we saw many smart glasses and a resurgence of exciting computer peripheral technology. Laptops got thinner, of course, and they also got longer, in Lenovo’s case. Gaming handhelds are here to stay, with seemingly every favorite computer maker developing their mobile concoction. The weird stuff was interesting, too. The indoor gardening studio that won one of our favorites reminded us that all you need to grow is an ample water supply and lights to inspire. HiSense reminded us that appliances can match your home’s aesthetic. Companion robots are still on the CES show floor. Samsung and TCL drew passersby in with their respective ideas, though TCL’s was the cutest. Want to see it all? Scroll here. Or, head to the landing page to see the announcements made individually. It was a packed year and a little busier than we’d anticipated. That’s good news for gadgets in 2025. One more excellent take on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s newfound fame to close us out: Jensen Huang Says Nvidia Is a ‘Technology Company,’ but It’s Really an AI Company Signing off, Kyle Barr, Florence Ion, Jorge Jimenez, Rose Pastore, and Sherri L. Smith Jan 10The Incredible Bending Gaming Monitor from LG © Sherri L. Smith / Gizmodo LG is on a tear this year. If you’re bored with hearing about the company’s TVs, take a gander at its monitors. Namely, the LG UltraGear OLED Bendable Gaming Monitor. This is the world’s first bendable 5K2K gaming monitor. We played with it on the show floor and timed the transformation from flat to 900R curvature at 7.31 seconds. And oh my OLED, the colors are a cavalcade of rich hues and stunning blacks with crystal clear detail. And if that’s not enough special sauce, the monitor’s Dual-Mode feature got a nice upgrade, letting gamers switch seamlessly between presets for resolution, aspect ratio, and picture size. —Sherri L. Smith Jan 10These Lenovo Monitors Can Track You So You’ll Never Avoid Seeing or Hearing Your Screen © Kyle Barr / Gizmodo Two concept monitors by Lenovo show us how, in the future, we may never be able to entirely turn away from our screens. The company’s ThinkCentre M90a Pro Gen 6 smart monitor uses technology from Audfly to track the user’s position in front of the screen and only blast the subject with audio. Anyone not being tracked by the monitor will barely hear a whisper, even when the subject receives a fuller sound experience. The sound quality wasn’t close to the HiFi audio you want for music, but it may work well for when you have a video meeting and don’t want to distract any deskmates.  The other concept monitor used computer vision to track whether the user moved to the left or right, keeping the user center-screen. It wasn’t particularly fast and wasn’t always 100% accurate, but it may work well enough if you’re a desk worker who can’t sit still. —Kyle Barr Jan 10A Supersized Gaming Handheld PC from Acer © Sherri L. Smith It seems that PC gaming handhelds are here to stay. And now Acer’s ready to jump into the mix with a couple of their own, the Acer Blade 8 and the massive Acer Blade 11. Sporting a ridiculous 10.95-inch, 2560 x 1600 resolution display with a 144Hz refresh rate, the Blade 11 is one of the biggest handhelds on the market. Dimensions aside, the Blade 11 also rocks an AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS with 16GB of RAM and up to 2TB of solid-state storage. Like the Lenovo Legion Go and Nintendo Switch, the Blade 11 has detachable joysticks and a kickstand. But the biggest surprise is that despite its size, the Blade 11 is very light at only 2.31 pounds. —Sherri L. Smith Jan 10This Little Doodad Can Turn Any Game Into Sexy Time Have you ever thought: how can I make this video game sexy? Then worry not because Motorbunny, makers of straddle-style sex machines, has the answer. The company debuted the Fluffer PlayMate Plug-in Haptic Relay, a USB-C dongle that will change how you play video games. Plug the tiny gadget into the charging port of your PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S, or X controller (it also works with Nintendo Switch), and the PlayMate translates in-game actions into a haptic, rumbling sensation on a Bluetooth-connected Motorbunny sex machine for a more stimulating form of interactive play. Jan 10Meet the Overclockable Lawnmower © Sherri L. Smith / Gizmodo We knew you could overclock CPUs and GPUs, but lawnmowers? Now we’ve seen everything. But such is the case with the Litheli EasySurge 18.5-inch Lawn Mower. First, the design: The Litheli doesn’t look like any lawnmower I’ve ever seen. It seems like it’d be more at home on The Jetsons than on the CES 2025 show floor. Even though the Litheli is small, it’s mighty. Thanks to the company’s proprietary EasySurge system, the mower’s motor can go from 1,000-1,200W with a speed up to 4,100 RPMs. You can also adjust the self-propelling speed, modify the mower’s cutting levels, and switch between cutting modes from the easy-to-use Surge panel. —Sherri L. Smith Jan 10Acer Throws the Kitchen Sink and Then Some into Gaming Laptops © Sherri L. Smith / Gizmodo When it comes to gaming laptops, more is better. Acer got the memo by refreshing the Predator Helios 18 and 16 AI laptops. Both systems have the new Intel Core Ultra 9 processor 275HX that boasts AI-accelerated performance. That’s joined by Nvidia’s latest powerhouse, the GeForce RTX 5090 GPU. Tricked out, the Helios 16 can accommodate 64GB of DDR5 RAM with a 4TB of PCIe Gen 5 SSD. But the Helios 18 said, “Hold my beer,” and maxed out with a ludicrous 192GB of RAM and 6TB of storage. Display-wise, the 16-inch has an OLED panel with a 240Hz refresh rate, while the 18-inch goes 4K with a mini-LED screen with dual-mode resolution switching. We can’t wait to get our hands on these bad boys.—Sherri L. Smith Jan 10This Floor Lets You Fall Like a Ninja © Sherri L. Smith / Gizmodo Fall injuries are no joke, especially for senior citizens. According to the CDC, in 2020, “unintentional fall” death rates for adults aged 65 and over was nearly 71 per 100,000 population for men and almost 62 for women. However, the Japanese company Magic Shield has a solution, and we hope it will be stateside soon. The Shinobi Floor looks and feels like your average hardwood floor. Take a tumble, however, and you’ll find a soft, springy feel instead of a cold, unforgiving floor. The patented shock-absorbing mat is placed directly beneath the floor, removing the impact’s force. So far, it’s been implemented in eight countries and 600 hospitals and senior centers. —Sherri L. Smith Jan 10These Sex Toys Let You Reach Out and Touch Someone—Remotely © Sherri L. Smith / Gizmodo Lovense, purveyor of app-connected teledildonics, brought their latest wares to CES, and we’re intrigued. The Lovense Mission 2 and Solace Pro are a vibrating dildo and an AI-powered male masturbator that can be purchased together or solo. When paired together via the Lovense app, stroking the Mission 2 will cause the Solace Pro to move in tandem, matching the former stroke for stroke. It’s a cool way to have a sexy time when your lover isn’t in the vicinity. Fun fact: you can daisy chain up to 100 Lovense products, making it some of the safest sex you can have.—Sherri L. Smith Jan 10Now Your Favorite Anime Character Can Dance For You Ever wonder if Kakashi from Naruto or Kenpachi from Bleach can bust a move? Now you can find out thanks to Code 27 Character Lightbox. Upload a 3D model of your favorite character, and you’ll be off to the races. But Code 27 allows your character to be more than a dancing mascot. The character can turn and interact with you in real time by utilizing Freeform Large Language Models (LLM) and a rotating base with sound and sight recognition. It can even recall and summarize past interactions. It can also provide the day’s weather and offer conditions on your daily commute. Best of all, you aren’t confined to pre-existing characters, as Code 27 allows you to create your own unique characters.—Sherri L. Smith Jan 10The Weirdest Gadgets We Saw at CES 2025 © Jorge Jimenez / Gizmodo Weird things are fun, and sometimes, they’re even helpful, like the Nékojita FuFu. It’s a cute little device that hangs on your cup to help cool down a hot drink. The TCL Alme was another one of those weird things that caught our eye. Lenovo’s ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable, with its expandable laptop screen, also made the list. The Weirdest Gadgets We Saw at CES 2025 Jan 10Gizmodo’s Best of CES 2025 Awards © Gizmodo JUST IN CASE you were wondering where we’re hosting our Best of CES 2025 awards, you can click the link below to get your fill. This year’s winners include the Lenovo Legion Go S, the XReal One Pro, and a mini washer-dryer combo from HiSense. Razer’s butt-cooling chair is also in the mix, as is LG’s portable display. Gizmodo’s Best of CES 2025 Awards: See the Winners Jan 10This Drone Can Fly in Any Direction and Roll Like a Tumbleweed © Kyle Barr / Gizmodo What is the point of the HAGAMOSphere drone? The device is like your typical drone, though it has eight propellers mounted to a cubic frame, surrounded by rods and panels that allow it to contort to a ball-like shape. The frame is designed to roll along the ground or other rough terrain, with each panel meant to protect the drone from anything that would impact the propellers. I asked the designers of the “Hybrid Autonomous Ground / Aerial MObility System” (hence, HAGAMOS) about its use cases, and they joked, “We hoped you would tell us.” It could have applications in disaster response or construction, such as when you need a hardy drone that can survive rough or dangerous terrain. In my mind, I wonder how it might do for a few drone-based downhill races.  —Kyle Barr Jan 10Jackery’s Solar Roof Panels Look Like Classic Roofing Tiles © Kyle Barr / Gizmodo Solar tech company Jackery is promoting one of the most mundane-looking solar panels yet, enough that it might blend in with neighboring homes. The Jackery Solar Roof has curved blades and a modular design that allows it to stack on your roof like any traditional roofing tile. If you don’t mind heights, you may even be able to install them yourself. Jackery claims they can survive in temperatures between -40 and 185 degrees Fahrenheit. They also come with a 30-year warranty. As for their power efficiency, Jackery says its solar panels should offer more than 25% cell conversion, though what’s recorded in the lab is often worse than out in the field. We can’t verify any of those efficiency claims, though the aesthetic makes it a promising proposition for homeowners. —Kyle Barr Jan 10The Hyve Pod Prevents Porch Pirates By Screaming When You Move it © Kyle Barr / Gizmodo Hyve’s “delivery pod” is made to sit on your doorstop and provide a secure place for delivery drivers to secure your packages. The $300 device can be opened with a pin code or an app. This means you could include the pin with the shipping company in your delivery instructions, then hope the driver takes the time to open your pod and drop in your parcel. As for how it prevents porch pirates, the Hyve pod includes an accelerometer, so it knows to start blaring a sound if somebody moves it. There’s an additional cable to attach the box to a door frame, but that’s a last resort. You—and any Hyve-connected neighbors—are notified if somebody starts running down the street with it. —Kyle Barr The Hyve Parcel Safe Prevents Porch Pirates By Screaming at Them Jan 10This Hiking Exoskeleton May Make Climbing Cliffs Too Easy © Gizmodo Are you still considering the $5,000 MO/GO exoskeleton pants for hiking? Hypershell brought out its $800 Hypershell X hiking exoskeleton to CES 2025, promising that it can push your legs better and support backpack weight for long jaunts in the woods or mountains. The company sent us a pair early before CES, but the team was on the ground hooking people up to their own pair of robotic limbs. Like MO/GO, Hypershell X senses your leg movement and uses motors to propel your limbs forward with a 2ms response time. Hypershell promises it can boost your leg performance by up to 40%. It has several modes that provide a more subtle aid to your limbs. The device ranges up to 17.5 kilometers, or a little less than 11 miles on a single battery. The pants are up for preorder and should ship later this month.—Kyle Barr Jan 10Rock-ola Is Still Making Jukeboxes After 90 Years © Jorge Jimenez / Gizmodo If you have ever been to a diner in the US at any point in your life, chances are you’ve come across a Rock-ola Bubbler Jukebox. Well, Rock-ola is still rocking along after all. The modern Bubblers still have the retro look of the old Jukeboxes despite all the added bells and whistles. They can now connect to wireless home speaker systems like Sonos. While the Bubbles with a digital interface is convenient in this modern world, the models with physical music pages and vinyl record players can’t be beaten. If you’re wondering, one of these bad boys will set you back around $10,000. Jan 9Reolink’s Security Cameras Can Basically See in the Dark One common complaint about home security cameras is the bad video quality of the clips, especially in low-light environments. The new Duo 3 WiFi has a 180-degree Field-of-View (FoV) and uses AI motion detection to identify people and wildlife that may wander onto your property. The camera uses Reolink’s ColorX technology to see in the dark. You can see from the demo how the ColorX provides a surprisingly detailed picture of toy animals stuffed inside the dark box. —Jorge Jimenez Jan 9My Favorite Character at CES 2025 Was Sassy VR Man Shiftall showed off its HaritoraX 1.1B wireless body tracking hardware that lets you control digital avatars with your entire body. This product is aimed at folks who use social VR games. I loved seeing this Shiftall employee bring to life the subtle nuances of being a sexy anime lady. —Jorge Jimenez Jan 9Traffic Is Never an Issue When Your Motorcycle Can Turn Into a Quadcopter © Jorge Jimenez / Gizmodo Rictor calls the X1-Rider “the world’s first amphibious passenger flying motorcycle.” It’s a bike that can sprout propellers. The rendered video shows the X1-Rider using automatic route planning to trace an optimal flight path before initiating its automated take-off process. Once airborne, you have a maximum flight speed of 100 km/h and a flight time of 40 minutes on its electric battery. The rider/pilot can either manually fly themselves or have the bike use its autopilot. A Rictor rep says we should see these on the road and in the skies in late 2026. While I am terrified of flying in this thing, I also really want to try it myself. —Jorge Jimenez Jan 9This Sex Toy Works With Over 30,000 Pieces of Interactive Content Ohdoki is ramping up the interactivity with its latest gadget, the Handy. A sex toy designed for penis owners, the Handy consists of a silicon sleeve attached to a powerful brushless motor that can be adjusted by speed and stroke length. The device can be used either off or online via the companion app. It can also be enjoyed with VR content. Speaking of content, Handy owners will be spoiled with choices for content as the company reports there are 30,000 compatible videos out there to choose from. —Sherri L. Smith Jan 9The Smart TV That Doubles as a Tablet and Much More © Sherri L. Smith / Gizmodo LG makes a lot of TVs. There are some that bend, some that are wireless, and there are even a couple that you can see through. But the weirdest (and most delightful) televisions in the company’s stable are the StanbyMe line, particularly the StanbyMe 2. The StanbyMe 2 looks like a Smart TV and a tablet had a baby. The device has a massive 27-inch touchscreen and lasts four hours on a charge. And if you don’t feel like mounting it to a wall, you can connect the strap and carry it around like a massive purse, hang it vertically like a piece of art, or tuck it into a suitcase until you’re ready to watch. My favorite way to see the StanbyMe is by far the most outlandish. You can attach it to LG’s tripod with a speaker for rollable entertainment.—Sherri L. Smith Jan 9This Company is Selling the Apple Vision Pro’s Weird EyeSight Feature as its Own Thing © Kyle Barr / Gizmodo The Apple Vision Pro’s external display uses something called “EyeSight” so people on the outside can see what you’re up to. B2B company EyeBliss enjoyed this about the Vision Pro, so it built it into its goggles and on a mannequin torso (seen here). The floating eyes in a black void certainly have a more lifelike appearance than the WeFace from the past two CESes, though I’m not sold on the idea that these electric eyes add any personality to isolating VR headsets. —Kyle Barr Jan 9Monster Makes Smart Glasses Now, and They Actually Look Nice © Jorge Jimenez / Gizmodo Monster is working on a line of smart glasses that look like something I’d actually put on my face. These specs primarily work as a Bluetooth headset with touch controls on the temples. I didn’t listen to music, but I was told you can get between 4 and 7 hours of listening time. Suppose you were expecting something to rival the Meta Ray-Bans. In that case, you might be slightly disappointed since these glasses can’t take pictures or video. However, Monster revealed that it’s working on a pair of smart AI glasses with a built-in camera and a translation feature. —Jorge Jimenez Jan 9This $20,000 Gaming Pod Looks Like It Came From Outer Space © Jorge Jimenez / Gizmodo Have you just wanted to game in your own little pod? Disconnected from the rest of the world? The XEO Pod might be up your alley. The XEO is a gaming chair enclosure that fully engulfs you. Neon lights surround you, and haptics are built into the seat so you can feel every explosion and impact travel up your spine. I fell in love with this thing and desperately wanted one for myself. Too bad it’s $20,000. —Jorge Jimenez Jan 9This Little Gadget Could Inject Your Next Covid Shot, No Needle Required © Rose Pastore / Gizmodo So many people suffer from needle phobia, and the medical waste created from single-use needles is staggering. A Dutch company called Flowbeams wants to solve both problems with a needle-free handheld injecting device. It uses lasers to shoot a stream of liquid (like a vaccine, insulin, tattoo ink, Ozempic, or Botox) into the skin at high speed, and there’s no biohazard waste to dispose of afterward. The company says it’s painless and that trials so far have shown it to insert the intended substance into the skin effectively. The device hasn’t been cleared by regulators yet, but Flowbeams aims to start with cosmetic injections and eventually move into medical use. —Rose Pastore Jan 9Real-Time Space Weather Forecasts Thanks to Itty Bitty Satellites © Rose Pastore / Gizmodo I met with a company called Mission Space that is working to increase the accuracy and timeliness of space weather forecasting. Solar storms can disrupt electric grids and satellite communications, including GPS, which affects air travel, agriculture, and many other vital industries. With a network of tiny satellites, Mission Space aims to offer real-time, precise space weather forecasts, providing space agencies, companies, and any other stakeholders a much clearer picture of when and where dangerous solar radiation may strike. —Rose Pastore Jan 8Why Have a Birdfeeder With One Camera, When You Could Have a Birdfeeder With Two Cameras? © Kyle Barr / Gizmodo Those who pass the time leering at the avian creatures enticed to your outdoor bird feeder may get annoyed when the wild beasts don’t pose for the camera. The Bird Buddy already does a good job analyzing species of birds that perch in front of its lens. However, for those flighty birds who won’t stay still, the Netvue Birdfy 2 Duo includes an additional camera to watch winged friends from the front and side with a wide-angle and portrait lens. The perch offers enough room for multiple birds at a time so that voyeuristic bird lovers can see various angles of a feeding frenzy. —Kyle Barr Jan 8Panasonic Returns to the U.S. With OLED and LED TVs © Kyle Barr / Gizmodo Late last year, Panasonic declared it was finally returning to the U.S. market for its TVs. The company started its American journey with just three mini-LED models. Panasonic is expanding on that with a wealth of new OLED and cheaper LED models. The flagship is the Z95B tandem OLED, which promises enhanced brightness due to the layered OLED panels. In person, it features the inky blacks and deep colors typical of these displays. The TVs feature a new backside with the rear subwoofers, which made for solid audio on last year’s flagship. There’s further promise that it is better at heat dissipation than the previous generation. —Kyle Barr Jan 8Joel and Ellie from The Last of Us Were Running Security at the Sony Booth © Gizmodo One of the longest lines at Central Hall at the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) was at Sony, but it wasn’t to see a car, game console, or fancy TV. It was to snag a photo with two cosplayers dressed as Joel and Ellie from The Last of Us video games. I was told to look mean, so I did my best. —Jorge Jimenez Jan 8This Quantum AI Security Camera Instantly Flagged Me as a “Person of Interest” © Gizmodo SK Technologies showed off its Quantum AI Camera, which works in tandem with live CCTV footage. The AI will scan crowds, instantly highlighting anything and anyone it deems suspicious, then alert security. Since this was a show floor demo, anyone who walked past it caught the attention of the AI. It’s not perfect since it flagged me twice, describing me as “a man in leopard print coat walking” and “a man in black mask riding a scooter.” I was not wearing a mask nor riding a scooter, so I think some things should best done with actual security personnel.—Jorge Jimenez Jan 8Hisense’s New 70’s-Style Washer-Dryer is Good for Diapers or Other Unmentionables © Kyle Barr / Gizmodo What is this, a clotheswasher for ants? Hisense’s next miniature appliance seems to do it all, at least for your small loads of sensitive garments. The LuxCare mini washer-dryer uses microbubbles to clean clothing items more gently. It won’t fit your full load of dirty laundry in its tumbler, but for “intimate and specialty fabrics” it should do a full wash and dry cycle in just under 80 minutes. The LuxCare could prove a timesaver for those with delicate clothes, but what helps sell it is the 1960s aesthetic. —Kyle Barr Jan 8Xgimi Ascend Is a Massive Soundbar That Hides a 100-inch Roll-Up Projector Screen The Xgimi Ascend is a 2-in-1 ALR (Ambient Light Rejection) screen and soundbar. Inside the massive sound bar is a 100-inch motorized floor-rising screen. At a private demo at CES 2025, Xgimi told Gizmodo that if this product were to hit the market, it’d likely come bundled with the Aura 2 short throw 4K projector. You can adjust the screen to a smaller size for ambient mode when you’re not watching movies. I was treated to a nice little fireplace mode and a neat music mode. While just a prototype, I can easily see the Ascend appealing to folks looking for a 100-inch screen to watch movies without taking up an entire living room wall.—Jorge Jimenez Jan 8XReal’s New AR Glasses Make the Case That Real “Spatial Computing” Is Just Better Ultrawide © Gizmodo CES 2025 is inundated with smart glasses. It takes a lot to stand out from the crowd, but XReal, a company that’s been in the augmented reality glasses game longer enough, showed off the XReal One Pro AR glasses. Effectively, the device is a tethered monitor for most mobile devices or PCs. Unlike similar glasses, the XReal One’s frames allow you to see your content in an ultra-widescreen view. It’s a feature akin to the ultrawide mirroring on the Apple Vision Pro or Meta Quest. The resolution is good enough to read small text without squinting. The glasses also include controls to change the size of windows you see through the AR environment. A single switch will also let you pin the mirrored window in space or have it follow your head. —Kyle Barr Jan 8Honda and Sony Reveal Afeela Sedan  © Rory Carroll / Gizmodo Honda and Sony jointly produced the Afeela 1 and Afeela 1 Signature sedans, officially available for pre-order in California. The EV will get at least 300 miles of range and level 2+ autonomous driving capability. The Afeela 1 starts at $89,900, and the Afeela 1 Signature Starts at $102,900.—Rory Carroll Jan 8Honda Reveals the Wild and Wedge-y 0 Series EV © Rory Carroll / Gizmodo Honda was a little late to the electric car party, but it’s hoping to make a big impact with its radical 0 (“zero”) series EVs. The company showcased the two prototype cars at CES 2025 and they should be pretty close to what we’ll see on the street in 2026. Honda’s Wild 0 Series EVs Slated for 2026 Jan 8Panasonic’s New Flagship Technics Earbuds Are Both New and Totally Old School © Kyle Barr / Gizmodo CES is usually full of clamor and noise, but Panasonic’s new EAH-AZ100 earbuds offered a surprisingly high-quality reprieve from the usual din. Panasonic’s $300 flagship earbuds include the active noise canceling you expect, but it was good enough to block out all but a bare murmur from the chatter surrounding me. Panasonic claims its new “magnetic fluid driver” in the buds produces quality, low-distortion sound, and I was impressed with the sound quality from the few songs I listened to. Plus, the case is beautiful thanks to its brushed metal finish and inlaid Technics logo. It has an old-school quality that makes me want to hold onto the case rather than shove it deep in my pocket. —Kyle Barr Jan 8Hisense First Commercial Micro-LED Display is a Sight for Sore Eyes © Kyle Barr / Gizmodo Display technology is starting yet another shift. Mini-LED and OLED remain the standard bearers for high-quality TVs, but Hisense’s first micro-LED display promises excellent contrast and high brightness without backlights. The display technology is based on more than 24 million microscopic LEDs, each able to emit its own red, green, or blue light. It promises OLED levels of inky blacks without risk of burn-in or future degradation. The 136MX is the only model of three that will make its way to the U.S. It’s a big display, and even without pricing or release date info available, it’s the type of TV company that markets to folks with deep pockets. Ignoring the size, the picture quality is excellent and bodes well for more commercial micro-LEDs in the future.  —Kyle Barr Jan 8The New Razer Blade 16 is Thinner, and Better for It © Kyle Barr / Gizmodo The Razer Blade is one of those laptops you can always expect to be, at the very least, reasonably good quality, though all too expensive. Last year’s new Razer Blade 16 fit that mold, though it was similar to 2023’s model size, weight, and dreaded $3,000 starting cost. The design is identical in many ways, but now it’s 30% thinner and weighs less. That doesn’t sound like a lot, but holding it aloft, the changes feel far more significant. The ergonomics have also improved with easier key travel and a slightly smaller trackpad. Razer will pack it with the latest Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs. The other end of the equation is also interesting: the new Blade 16 has an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX series CPU. There’s no option for an Intel CPU. We don’t know the pricing or release date, but at least we know just because the RTX 5090 desktop GPU is ginormous, it doesn’t mean our gaming laptops need to be. —Kyle Barr Jan 8TCL’s AIme is a GPT-Powered Baby Bot © Kyle Barr / Gizmodo Imagine if Samsung’s Ballie was a large baby carrier for a child-like, AI-powered robot. That’s essentially what TCL proposed with AIme. It’s a concept bot with image and speech recognition, but beyond its cute, alien penguin child exterior, it’s even weirder than that. The bot is modular, with three separate “cores” providing different functionality. The Drive Core provides mobility and audio. The Baby Core, with its face screen, uses image and voice AI to interact with users. Finally, the Mini Core attached to the Drive Core can act like a small, independent AI device for generating answers to questions. —Kyle Barr Jan 8This Gaming Handheld Includes a Trackball, Dial, and Numpad For Classic Games © Kyle Barr / Gizmodo My Arcade’s continuing retro console work with Atari has brought us numerous retro emulation devices, but the company’s latest is its most curious yet. My Arcade and Atari’s new Gamestation Go borrows heavily from the popular Steam Deck design, but it exchanges joysticks for a trackball and Numpad. The device relies on emulation to play over 200 retro console and arcade titles, most of which come from Atari’s back catalog. Having it in hand, I was surprised at how good the trackball felt. It’s a must-have for games like Missile Command. The device lights up the controls you’ll need for certain games. It also includes a micro-SD card slot for saves or, more likely, loading your own ROMs. —Kyle Barr Jan 7This MicroLED AI Smart Mirror Said That I Have Fantastic Skin © Gizmodo Samsung’s MicroLed Beauty Mirror completely made my day. It’s a Galaxy AI-powered smart mirror that scans your face and provides “personalized beauty insights.” The mirror will grade your skin at different levels and recommend skin care products based on your results. Even though I got a pretty score on my skin, it said I should add a green tea seed hyaluronic facial cream to my skincare routine. —Jorge Jimenez Jan 7Think You Might Have Sleep Apnea? This App Could Replace a Sleep Lab Study © Rose Pastore / Gizmodo If you have a snorer in your life who hasn’t done a sleep lab study (because it’s a huge hassle and often quite expensive), there’s an AI-powered app in development that claims to detect sleep apnea. You tape your phone to your chest overnight, and Apneal collects data on breathing, chest movement, and heartbeats. It captures audio of times when breathing is obstructed; listening to the recording later may be enough to motivate someone who’s been avoiding the issue to actually seek treatment. The company is in the early stages of seeking FDA clearance or approval and hopes Apneal will be available in 2026. —Rose Pastore Jan 7This High-Tech Blood Pressure Monitor Reveals a Whole Lot More About Your Heart © Rose Pastore / Gizmodo Former Gizmodo editor Rory Carroll and I checked out an FDA-cleared, souped-up blood pressure monitor at Pepcom last night. Conneqt Pulse has the standard inflating arm cuff you’re familiar with, but the level of data it produces goes way beyond just systolic and diastolic pressure. It also measures central blood pressure, central pulse pressure, and arterial stiffness, all important biomarkers for heart health, according to the company. The device, marketed for at-home use, comes with two consultations with a cardiologist to get insights into what your readings mean (and what actions you may need to take). The company says Conneqt Pulse has been used to collect data for more than 2,600 peer-reviewed studies. Pregnant women who are at risk of a serious complication known as preeclampsia could use an at-home device like this to keep tabs on their blood pressure, which can change suddenly during and after pregnancy. The device is available for preorder and starts shipping this month. —Rose Pastore Jan 7Grow an Indoor Garden Without Knowing Anything About Gardening © Jorge Jimenez / Gizmodo I think it’s safe to admit I don’t have much of a green thumb, so I’ll take all the help I can get. The $850 Gardyn Home and the new $500 Gardyn Studio are indoor gardens that use sensors and cameras to monitor the health of your greens. It’ll even automatically water the plants and adjust the lights for the ideal growing environment. The seeds sprout in these little pods, and the built-in AI will let you know when it’s time to harvest via an app. You can also use it to answer questions, like having a consultant gardener on your phone. You can grow flowers, herbs, and even fruits like strawberries. —Jorge Jimenez Jan 7This Cheap, Under-Desk Treadmill Could Send You Flying at Top Speeds © Gizmodo Urevo’s $200 CyberPad treadmill is compact and straightforward, and it’s all the better for it. The short treadmill is for light jogging and walking while at or taking a break from your desk. The CyberPad is short enough that those with extra-long strides may find their foot sliding off the back of the device. Otherwise, you can modify incline and speed with a small remote control, but not to the point you’re doing 80-degree sprints uphill. You may not see much of it from the image, but the treadmill also includes a few neat RGB lighting effects along the edges of the running pad. If so, it may be a good option for gamers who want their aerobic exercise to match their gamer room decor. —Kyle Barr Jan 7Wearing a Heavy Sweater to a Boxing Demo Was a Bad Idea © Gizmodo I wasn’t expecting to sneak in a workout at CES, but who can resist strapping on a pair of boxing gloves and wailing on a punching bag for a couple of minutes? Fightcamp is an interactive workout system that plugs into your TV and uses special sensors that fit in your wrist straps, providing real-time performance data and feedback. While this was a boxing demo, other workouts, such as kickboxing and strength training, are available. I did work up quite a sweat, though I mostly blame the fact that I was wearing a thick sweater. —Jorge Jimenez Jan 7The MCon Mobile Controller May Be the Most Portable Design Yet © Kyle Barr / Gizmodo The hype is real. The fold-out, MagSafe-attached MCon mobile controller may finally offer a better, more portable way to game on your phone. We only got to test a few prototypes, including a portable charger-sized puck that snaps open into a controller. Two wings housed in the back slide out to form the sticks. It’s surprisingly ergonomic and seamless. Even better, the MCon’s submerged joysticks don’t feel like twigs like they do on some other mobile controllers. The controller has received a fair amount of hype building behind it, and while we never advise buying into a Kickstarter before a product is fully realized, what’s here is very promising. —Kyle Barr Jan 7Wait, Is That a Massive 3D Gaming Handheld? © Kyle Barr / Gizmodo We didn’t imagine we would ever see it in the flesh, but at an Intel event, we finally got our hands on Tencent’s odd Nintendo 3DS-like 11-inch handheld. The device is a glasses-less 3D screen, and if that wasn’t interesting enough, it has removable controllers like the Lenovo Legion Go and Acer’s new Nitro Blaze 11. It’s also powered by the Intel Core Ultra 258V, a chip we found could output some impressive frame rates for a handheld in the MSI Claw 8 AI+. There’s no word about it coming to the U.S., but for now, we can sit back and dream. —Kyle Barr Jan 7MSI’s “Dragon Edition” Titan 18 Laptop Brings Thor’s Wrath With an RTX 5090 © Kyle Barr / Gizmodo MSI is not one to stray from outlandish laptop designs, but none have been as attractive as the new Titan 18. It may be its most embellished one yet. The Titan is the company’s top-end gaming PC, but this particular “Dragon Edition Norse Myth” includes an embossed cover featuring a dragon’s glaring eye and several Nordic runes. The inside also has a surprise, with a medallion encased in resin. The box has the same metal medallion you can hang next to your gamer desk. The laptop itself includes an Intel Core Ultra 9 285HX and a Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 laptop GPU. There’s a 4K mini-LED panel with up to a 120Hz refresh rate, which seems low considering the rest of the laptop’s specs. However, it makes up for that with the flat, glass touchpad and the Cherry mechanical keyboard switches. —Kyle Barr Jan 7This “Dockable PC” Would Let You Swap Out Your CPU Like an NES Cartridge © Kyle Barr / Gizmodo What if your laptop’s CPU could also become the central processor of your handheld PC? That’s the concept behind Intel’s prototype “Dockable PC.” To use it, you would rip out the CPU housed in the base of a laptop and plug it into the shell of a handheld, tablet, NUC, or practically any other device. Unfortunately, Intel did not show it in action. The company did say the machine in question was running a modern Lunar Lake chip. It’s hard to give the design much credence without seeing it operational, but the idea is enough to get me excited. —Kyle Barr Jan 7MSI’s Concept Desktop Case Design is a True Aquarium for Your PC © Kyle Barr / Gizmodo PC case design is becoming more and more inspired by your standard aquarium. MSI has plenty of fish tank PC cases like its updated Vision RS AI case. The company’s Project Zero X concept case is essentially a snake tank meant to sit flat against a wall and show off all those pretty internals. It’s a full back-mounted case with no wires or heatsink, though it offers a prominent place for the GPU. Stranger yet, the I/O ports are found center-mass on the case’s rear panel. —Kyle Barr Jan 7Nvidia’s GeForce Now Gets Dedicated App on Steam Deck, Meta Quest, Apple Vision Pro © Nvidia / Gizmodo If you’re a fan of Nvidia’s game streaming service, you now have more ways to play it without finding odd workarounds or using it on browsers. Nvidia released GeForce Now apps for the Steam Deck, so you no longer have to link the browser version to an app. There’s also a VR-specific version of the app coming to both Meta Quest and Apple Vision Pro platforms. You’ll also find the app there if you’re one of the few who uses a Pico-brand headset. —Kyle Barr Jan 7Nvidia Plans to Sell a $3,000 Desktop “Supercomputer” Dedicated to Running AI © Kyle Barr / Gizmodo “Project Digits” is Nvidia’s latest attempt to offer users more at-home AI processing. Unlike the cheap “Jetson” computer for simple AI tasks, Digits is a small, ultra-expensive box that offers the company’s newly-announced GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip for AI processing. The box is no larger than a typical mini-PC, but the SoC is supposed to offer “one petaflop” of AI performance, up to a quadrillion AI calculations per second. That’s compared to the TOPS, or trillions of operations per second, which is how most companies score their AI processing capabilities. By comparison, the latest Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 can handle 4,000 TOPS. The GB10 is being marketed to scientists, researchers, developers, and students, especially since you only need to plug it into a standard electrical outlet. —Kyle Barr Jan 7Nvidia Reveals Pricing on Mid-range and High-end RTX 50-Series Graphics Cards © Kyle Barr / Gizmodo If you want the latest and greatest graphics cards, the Nvidia 50-series GPUs will ask for you to open your wallet wide enough to fit a 4090 through it. GeForce RTX 5090: $2,000 RTX 5080: $1,000 RTX 5070 Ti: $750 RTX 5070: $550 Nvidia claims the new 5070 has performance on par with the past top-end RTX 4090, but we’ll have to wait and see how performance shakes up. Nvidia also claimed you can get RTX 5070-series gaming laptops for as low as $1,300. —Kyle Barr Jan 7CES Keynote Swarmed by People Come to See Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s Cool Jacket How long would you wait to see the CEO of a tech company, even one as profitable as Nvidia, speak? And no, it’s not Zombie Steve Jobs. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the new GeForce RTX 50-tier graphics cards. Yes, your typical PC gamer is interested, but gaming is just the side dish to the gravy train that is AI processing. The new cards are expensive pieces of hardware, but in Huang’s words, “GeForce brought AI to the masses, now we’re bringing AI to GeForce.” —Kyle Barr Jan 7The Asus Zenbook A14 is Light as a Feather © Kyle Barr / Gizmodo “Ceraluminum” is a silly misnomer for Asus’s latest Zenbook models. The name is supposed to offer the air of, well, aluminum. The Zenbook A14, which is making its rounds at CES, weights in at just 2.2 pounds. It’s so thin that Kyle thinks he might accidentally snap it in half. The Asus All-’Ceraluminum’ Zenbook A14 Is the Lightest Laptop I’ve Ever Held Jan 7Lenovo’s Legion Go S Runs Windows or SteamOS © Photo: Adriano Contreras / Gizmodo What’s your gaming flavor? Lenovo launched the Legion Go S with the option to run Windows or SteamOS, making it slightly platform-agnostic—at least as far as handheld gaming is concerned. The company also used the event for its latest handheld to tease the Lenovo Go 2. The Lenovo Legion Go S Is the First Non-Valve Handheld With SteamOS Jan 7Lenovo’s Rollable Laptop is Buyable After All © Lenovo / Gizmodo Lenovo’s 14-inch ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable, which we teased about a few weeks ago after it was leaked, is now available to buy. The laptop has a button to extend it into a 16.7-inch display. But that extra screen space will cost you: it starts at $3,500. You Can Actually Buy Lenovo’s ThinkBook Plus Rollable Laptop Jan 7Asus’s Newest ROG Laptops Have Lights On the Outside © Photo: Adriano Contreras / Gizmodo If you’re going to game on the go, you might as well do so in the most expressive way possible. Asus’s ROG Strix Scar laptops have “AniMe” lights on the outside that you can customize with software available on the inside. The look and feel are reminiscent of what Asus has been trying with its gaming-centric Android devices. We’re unsure if this is “worth it,” as they say, but at least the specs inside the gaming laptops sound worthy. Asus ROG Strix Scar Laptop Has All the Lights You’ll Ever Need Jan 7Maingear’s Pretty PC Cases Look Like Art Pieces © Maingear / Gizmodo Depending on your choice, Maingear’s Apex custom PC towers emit cyberpunk, vaporwave, or “good fortune” vibes. With these towers, you can easily add something striking to your arsenal without customizing anything. Click through for a closer look at the new PC designs. Maingear’s Custom Apex Art PC Cases Are So Pretty They’ll Make You Forget What’s Inside Them Jan 7Sweaty Butts Are No Match for Razer’s Arielle Gaming Chair © Razer / Gizmodo I always thought it was nice to go into a luxury car with car seat coolers. They help keep the butt from sticking to the seat! That’s the concept behind Razer’s Arielle gaming chair, which the company is showing off at CES 2025. The chair heats or cools, depending on your situation. I wonder if a chair like this would help with my body aches during certain times of the month. The Razer ‘Arielle’ Gaming Chair Cools Your Back and Butt to Avoid Severe Gamer Sweats Jan 7Alienware’s Laptops and Desktops Get Big Enough to Fit More Nvidia GPUs © Adriano Contreras / Gizmodo Where is Alienware headed now that Dell has rebranded its laptops into something more profesh? Dell’s gaming arm is doing what it can to entice people to buy its systems. The Area 51 laptop introduces a big kahuna chassis to fit Nvidia’s 50-series GPUs. Alienware is also introducing PC cases stuffed with up to $4,500 hardware. Alienware Is Bringing the Area-51 Desktop and It’s Enormous Jan 7Nvidia Debuts New GPUs at CES 2025 © Kyle Barr / Gizmodo The line to watch Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang was so long, laying claim to the idea that the company has become a bonafide celebrity since aligning itself with artificial intelligence. Anyway, that’s not why they were at CES 2025. Nvidia was there to unveil its latest RTX graphics cards. Read more at the link. Nvidia Unveils the RTX 50-Series GPUs Led By the Ginormous RTX 5090 Jan 7Anker’s Solar-Powered Cooler Keeps Stuff Cold and Smartphones Charged Up © Anker / Gizmodo Anker’s new EverFrost 2 Electric Cooler is a fridge on wheels. It comes in three sizes, the largest of which is 58L, and features a freezer compartment that can keep ice chips in their cute block shape. Up to two charging bricks can power the fridge, or one can charge a phone. The EverFrost 2 pairs nicely with Anker’s solar-powered umbrella. Anker’s Solar-Powered Cooler Is a Bonafide Fridge on Wheels Jan 7Is Eufy’s 3-in-1 Robot Vacuum the Transformer of Cleaning? © Eufy / Gizmodo A vacuum that does it all? It’s unbelievable, but Eufy hopes you’ll give its robot vacuum a chance. This three-in-one device features a vacuum “core” that can be swapped between the robot shell, upright, or handheld. It also has three attachments and an enormous dust bin the robot vacuum empties at the end of a cleaning session. Eufy’s 3-in-1 Robot Vacuum Wants to Be the Only Vacuum You’ll Ever Need Jan 6Toyota’s Tech Incubator Taps Noodles, Coffee For Its Woven City © Toyota / Gizmodo Toyota took to the stage at CES 2025 to announce its progress on its Woven City. This project culminates all of Toyota’s manufacturing arms to help expand the brand’s image beyond the automobile. Toyota has pegged several high-profile partners for the Woven City, including UCC Japan Co., which plans to build “futuristic coffee experiences,” and Daikin Industries, which will test its pollen-free spaces inside the Toyota dome. Nissin Food Products Co., the company behind some of your favorite instant noodles, is also joining the fun, but probably not by constructing its headquarters inside a large building that looks like a cup of noodles. (That’s a missed opportunity.) Toyota’s ‘Woven City’ Is Coming Together Jan 6Balled-Up Socks Are No Match For This Robot Vacuum With an Extendable Arm © Roborock / Gizmodo The Roborock Saros Z70 has one heck of an arm. From the outside, it looks like a regular robot vacuum. But if it sees something in its path, it extends a retractable arm to move it out of the way. If only more robots did this! This Robot Vacuum Has a Claw Arm That’s Perfect for Picking Up Rogue Socks Jan 6AMD’s Radeon 9000 Gaming Processors Are Coming To a Gaming Laptop Near You © AMD / Gizmodo AMD has big plans for its silicon lineup in 2025. The first major expansion of the brand’s CPU lineup starts with the Zen 5 and Ryzen 9 X3D chips becoming available for high-powered gaming PCs. The Radeon RX 9700 graphics cards are also a part of the lineup, though they’re not eating Nvidia’s lunch quite yet. Read more at the link. AMD’s Powerful Radeon 9000 Gaming CPUs Are Coming to Laptops Jan 6Mixed Reality Beauty Tech Projects Realistic Makeup Directly Onto Your Face Kose, a Japanese cosmetics company that’s been around since 1946, showed off what it calls a Mixed Reality Makeup system at CES Unveiled Sunday night. I sat down in the booth in front of a small projector and, holding just a regular hand mirror, could see realistic makeup looks flash across my face. Even as I turned my head and changed my expression, the bright colors of projected eyeshadow, lipstick, and blush followed the contours of my face, though not seamlessly. I quickly realized I don’t like myself in lavender or lime green. Kose says the system could be used to quickly try out various looks (like on a film set or at a mall cosmetics counter) without the effort and cleanup of actually rubbing pigments onto your skin.—Rose Pastore Jan 6Say Goodbye to Dell’s ‘XPS’ branding, and Hello to ‘Pro’ © Dell / Gizmodo Goodbye, XPS. Sure, we spent a decade with you discerning between its dull, stuffy enterprise laptops and the beefed-up ones in pretty packages. I am typing this from a Dell XPS, which is now considered vintage. Dell announced at CES 2025 that “XPS” and “Latitude” laptops are dunzo. They’re being swapped for a plainer, more straightforward motif. Laptops will be split into three categories to denote the cost of the hardware stuffed inside: Dell, Dell Pro, and Dell Pro Max. Sounds rather iPhone-y. Dell’s ‘Unified Branding’ Is Completely Confusing Jan 6The Acer Nitro Blaze 11 Is So Big, It Could Be a Laptop © Acer The Acer Nitro Blaze 11 is a supersized handheld, and that’s putting it mildly. The 11-inch device could be a laptop if it wanted to. But it’s not. It purports instead to be a mobile gaming console with all that you need on the go and then some. You can read more about the specifications inside that make this a hearty mobile play station on the go. The Acer Nitro Blaze 11 Is the Anti-Nintendo Switch Jan 6This Spoon Shocks Your Tongue So You Can Taste Salt © Jorge Jimenez / Gizmodo When food tech meets health tech: Kirin, the Japanese company known for its soups and ramen, debuted a spoon designed to help you taste salt. It shocks your tongue! The Electric Salt Spoon delivers a minute electrical charge through the utensil to stimulate the sodium that’s already present in human saliva. The naturally occurring salt helps to enhance the salty flavor in whatever you’re eating. It’s a novel way for people who have to cut their sodium intake to still enjoy their favorite foods in a healthier way. —Sherri L. Smith Jan 6TCL’s QM6K TVs are Bright, Bold, and Budget-friendly © Charles Anthony Davis / DreamSmith LLC TCL’s latest TVs are among the biggest on the CES 2025 show floor. The 55-inch version will cost $750, while the 98-inch version will retail for $3,500. We got up close and personal with the new TVs, including how TCL managed to keep the cost of its hybrid Q-Mini-LED TVs at a comfortable price point. TCL’s Latest TV Is Big, Bold, and Beautiful, and I Want It Now Jan 6Qualcomm Comes for PCs with the New Snapdragon X ARM Chip © Qualcomm Qualcomm is continuing its maelstrom of AI-forward ARM-based chips for PCs. The new Snapdragon X chip is a 4nm process with a scaled-back clock speed compared to last year’s release. It is meant to compete among the low-end to mid-range set. Qualcomm claims the new chip performs at least 60% better than its predecessor in benchmarks, though the real key will be battery efficiency. The New Snapdragon X Is Qualcomm’s ARM Chip for Lightweight PCs Jan 6Samsung Ball-E Just Became a Wine Expert © Jorge Jimenez Samsung’s adorable little ball droid is back. This time, its AI has been upgraded to better play the personal assistant role. It’s got a quicker response time and promises to provide more useful answers to your questions. For example, it can determine which wine pairs best with steak by simply reading the bottles’ logos. —Jorge Jimenez Jan 6This Teeny Little Robot Will Cool Your Hot Drinks © Jorge Jimenez The Nékojita FuFu does only two things: It cools your drinks and looks incredibly adorable. It uses a “Fu-ing” algorithm system that randomizes various blowing modes. The company claims it can reduce the temperature of a hot drink from 190°F to 160°F and 151°F in just under five minutes. In addition to cups, the FuFu can be mounted on flat plates to cool soup. —Jorge Jimenez Jan 6This Creepy Robot Table Was Actually Pretty Polite The Jizai Mi-Mo AI robot may look like a six-legged table with a lamp. But it’s actually a walking, waving robot. Jizai CEO and creator Yuki Ishikawa told Gizmodo that he wanted the Mi-Mo to look like a piece of furniture that resembles a living creature. It uses a handful of AI models to interact with its environment. On the show floor, it would walk to folks and wave, but I can see a future where this thing will fetch me the TV remote. —Jorge Jimenez Jan 6I Didn’t Realize How Much I Wanted a Foldable Projector © Jorge Jimenez / Gizmodo Over the past year, I’ve slowly become a projector guy. Not just any projector, but tiny projectors. The Aurzen ZIP is a Z-style trifold portable projector that easily fits in your back pocket. The 720p projector has a working distance of 18 inches, making it perfect for kids to play backseat movies on a long car ride. It can wirelessly mirror your phone and charge via USB-C. It is also MagSafe compatible. The Zip costs $400 and will pop up on Kickstarter soon.  —Jorge Jimenez Jan 6Becoming a Rockstar Just Became Easier With a Stringless Guitar © Jorge Jimenez / Gizmodo The LiberLive C1 is all about making your air guitar fantasies come true. It’s the first-ever stringless smart guitar. You’ll feel right at home if you’ve ever used a Guitar Hero guitar. The chords have designated buttons on the neck and two strumming paddles. There are three built-in speakers, but you can hook the C1 to headphones or speakers. The app has a deep song library and can upload and share your music. —Jorge Jimenez Jan 6Intel Introduces New Arrow Lake Chips to Boost Performance Beyond Gaming © Intel The dominating chipmaker unveiled new chips designed for enterprise and gaming laptops, called the 200H and 200HX series. The company hopes the Ultra 200S will compensate for Arrow Lake’s disappointing gaming performance. At the link, we’ve got details on which PCs will be the first to get Intel’s new top-tier Lunar Lake silicon.

Anyone not being tracked by the monitor will barely hear a whisper, even when the subject receives a fuller sound experience.

It’s a feature akin to the ultrawide mirroring on the Apple Vision Pro or Meta Quest. The resolution is good enough to read small text without squinting.

The device is available for preorder and starts shipping this month. \u003cem\u003e—Rose Pastore\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003chr/\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"live-e02f7b596e9b9ffd362f8ff2a60a0d6f\"\u003e\n    \u003ctime datetime=\"2025-01-07 15:27\" title=\"07/01/2025 15:27\"\u003eJan 7\u003c/time\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003ca href=\"#live-e02f7b596e9b9ffd362f8ff2a60a0d6f\"\u003eGrow an Indoor Garden Without Knowing Anything About Gardening\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_2000547251\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2000547251\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Growlights_CEs2025-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Growlights Ces2025\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Growlights_CEs2025-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Growlights_CEs2025-300x200.jpg 300w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Growlights_CEs2025-768x512.jpg 768w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Growlights_CEs2025-336x224.jpg 336w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Growlights_CEs2025-1400x932.jpg 1400w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Growlights_CEs2025-680x453.jpg 680w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Growlights_CEs2025-896x597.jpg 896w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Growlights_CEs2025.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 2rem), (max-width: 1279px) calc(100vw - 26rem), 680px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2000547251\"\u003e© Jorge Jimenez / Gizmodo\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think it’s safe to admit I don’t have much of a green thumb, so I’ll take all the help I can get.

The short treadmill is for light jogging and walking while at or taking a break from your desk. The CyberPad is short enough that those with extra-long strides may find their foot sliding off the back of the device. Otherwise, you can modify incline and speed with a small remote control, but not to the point you’re doing 80-degree sprints uphill. You may not see much of it from the image, but the treadmill also includes a few neat RGB lighting effects along the edges of the running pad. If so, it may be a good option for gamers who want their aerobic exercise to match their gamer room decor. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan\u003e—Kyle Barr\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003chr/\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"live-81895a03503a4ca3f9c8287b5688aabf\"\u003e\n    \u003ctime datetime=\"2025-01-07 14:55\" title=\"07/01/2025 14:55\"\u003eJan 7\u003c/time\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003ca href=\"#live-81895a03503a4ca3f9c8287b5688aabf\"\u003eWearing a Heavy Sweater to a Boxing Demo Was a Bad Idea\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_2000547205\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2000547205\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Boxing_CES2025-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Boxing Ces2025\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Boxing_CES2025-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Boxing_CES2025-300x200.jpg 300w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Boxing_CES2025-768x512.jpg 768w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Boxing_CES2025-336x224.jpg 336w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Boxing_CES2025-1400x932.jpg 1400w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Boxing_CES2025-680x453.jpg 680w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Boxing_CES2025-896x597.jpg 896w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Boxing_CES2025.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 2rem), (max-width: 1279px) calc(100vw - 26rem), 680px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2000547205\"\u003e© Gizmodo\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI wasn’t expecting to sneak in a workout at CES, but who can resist strapping on a pair of boxing gloves and wailing on a punching bag for a couple of minutes?

It’s surprisingly ergonomic and seamless. Even better, the MCon’s submerged joysticks don’t feel like twigs like they do on some other mobile controllers.
