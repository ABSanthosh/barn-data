  "description": "\"Friction between bosses and their employees over the terms of their return shows no signs of abating,\" reports the Los Angeles Times. But there's one big loophole... About 80% of organizations have put in place return-to-office policies, but in a sign that many managers are reluctant to clamp down on the flexibility employees have become accustomed to, only 17% of those organizations actively enforce their policies, according to recent research by real estate brokerage CBRE. \"Some organizations out there have 'mandated' something, but if most of your organization is not following that mandate, then there is not too much you can do to enforce it,\" said Julie Whelan, head of research into workplace trends for CBRE... The tension \"is due to the fact that we have changed since we all went to our separate corners and then came back\" from pandemic-imposed office exile, said Elizabeth Brink, a workplace expert at architecture firm Gensler. \"It's fair to say that we have different needs now.\" A disconnect persists between employer expectations for office attendance and employee behavior, CBRE found. Sixty percent of leaders surveyed said they want their employees in the office three or more days a week, while only 51% reported that employees work in the office at that frequency. Conversely, 37% of employees show up one or two days a week, yet only 17% of employers are satisfied with that attendance. In the article, one worker complains about their employer's two-days-a-week of mandated in-office time. \"I feel like I'm back in grade school and being forced to sit down and do my homework.\" The article also notes some employers are also considering changes in the other direction: \"calculating whether to shed office space to cut down on rent, typically the largest cost of operating a business after payroll.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
