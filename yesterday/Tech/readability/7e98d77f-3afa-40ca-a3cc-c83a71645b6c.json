  "text": "After several false starts, Paramount’s finally making good on its years-old promise to give Michelle Yeoh a Star Trek vehicle of her own. Section 31 puts the once-evil version of Phillippa Georgiou center stage, and its newest trailer puts a bigger emphasis on the action and ragtag crew that’ll be aiding her in her exploits. Directed by Star Trek: Discovery producer/director Olatunde Osunsanmi, the film picks up with Georgiou living out her days in the prime universe as the owner of a fancy club on a space station outside of Federation space. All seems well until Section 31 agent Alok (Omari Hardwick) shows up looking to recruit her into its titular black ops division. The mission? Go off the books and handle a new threat the Federation can’t. Starfleet’s Rachel Garrett (Kacey Rohl) may be there to stop the team from breaking too many rules, but Georgiou and her crew know they’ll definitely be getting their hands dirty. Said crew invovles Changeoid spy Quasi (Sam Richardson), the exosuit-wearing Zeph (Robert Kazinsky), honeypot expert Melle (Humberly Gonzalez), and the tempermental Fuzz (Sven Ruygrok). Whereas the first trailer was glitzy and glamorous, this new one shows the team putting their skills to use and getting in the dirt—aka, chaos like club shootouts and dogfights,  while proclaiming they need to work together to stay alive. But we’re still not seeing them get up to the shady,  morally compromising stuff previously seen or hinted at in earlier Star Trek stories. You’ve got to figure that darkness is being hidden behind the spectacle and explosions we’re used to from Star Trek by now, especially since Georgiou’s got to contend with her past as an Emperor back in her home universe. We’ll find out for sure when Star Trek: Section 31 hits Paramount+ on January 24, 2025. Want more io9 news? Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what’s next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who.",
