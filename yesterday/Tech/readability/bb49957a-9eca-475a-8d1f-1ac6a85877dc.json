  "text": "The immersive mystery project 'Masquerade' has been revealed as an official Andrew Lloyd Webber spin-off. For the past few months, Phans (The Phantom of the Opera fans) have been following mysterious messages and clue drops around New York City for something called Masquerade. Talk online abounded about the roses left in Times Square or the red envelope letters signed by “the Opera Ghost” for the faithful, as a viral campaign teased that something was coming in the realm of immersive theater. As a big Phan and immersive theater nerd, I’ve waited from the far wings on the West Coast with major FOMO for more news. And finally, we know who the minds are behind the teased project based on Gaston Leroux’s The Phantom of the Opera.  Masquerade has officially been confirmed as a spin-off immersive experience inspired by Andrew Lloyd Webber’s The Phantom of the Opera by Deadline. The trade named Tony Award winner Diane Paulus (Waitress, Real Women Have Curves) as director, with Webber on board as a producer. It has not yet been revealed if the immersive production will include musical performances or be an atmospheric walk-through much like NYC’s late great Sleep No More. The Phantom himself shared a statement through Deadline: “I have secured an address on 57th Street, a more salubrious part of town than my previous, where I have instructed the director Diane Paulus to prepare my new vision of the legend,” it read. “I have observed that she has considerable credentials in the fields of opera and musical theater. Under my guidance she has created, along with my minion Lloyd Webber, an event like no other with my characters played by performers of exceptional ability.” Fellow Phans can RSVP for more news on the official site. Masquerade is slated to have a six-week preview run, with tickets going on sale Monday, June 30, for the show. The engagement dates have yet to be announced. © Masquerade Described as a production that’s “to be located on multiple floors” by Deadline, the experience “is designed to simulate a masked ball with attendees moving from room to room and floor to floor.” If some of what TikTok has sleuthed is true, we may be walking through key moments from the musical’s book. The possibilities are making my imagination run wild—there’s the cemetery, the Phantom’s lair, and, of course, the masquerade. We at least know the masquerade is the centerpiece of the production, as instructions mention a strict dress code including masks. On the official site you can also see pertinent details from “O.G.,” who we can just say is a fabulous party planner with a flair for the dramatic. “1) Masquerade is a 21+ event. However, during the six-week preview period, Saturday and Sunday Matinees will be 16+ 2) The dress code is for the six-week preview period 3) Masks WILL be provided to guests free of charge if they arrive without one. The complimentary masks are designed to be worn under glasses if you require them. Limited edition couture masks will be available for purchase as well. 4) Guests can choose either the glass of champagne OR a non-alcoholic sparkling option on arrival 5) The experience is ADA-accessible” The details of having a mask on and it mostly being a 21+ production are definitely reminiscent of Sleep No More’s hallmarks. So this might be Phantom in a way we’ve never seen. As a Universal Monsters fan, the possibility of horror tonally being involved pleases me. A celebration of his return, homaging his whole legacy, would be a dream. Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to find out how to secure seats in Box Number 5. Want more io9 news?
