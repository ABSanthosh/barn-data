  "description": "Google is rolling out Veo 2 video generation in the Gemini app for Advanced subscribers, allowing users to create eight-second, 720p cinematic-style videos from text prompts. 9to5Google reports: Announced at the end of last year, Veo 2 touts \"fluid character movement, lifelike scenes, and finer visual details across diverse subjects and styles,\" as well as \"cinematic realism,\" thanks to an understanding of real-world physics and human motion. In Gemini, Veo 2 can create eight-second video clips at 720p resolution. Specifically, you'll get an MP4 download in a 16:9 landscape format. There's also the ability to share via a g.co/gemini/share/ link. To enter your prompt, select Veo 2 from the model dropdown on the web and mobile apps. Just describe the scene you want to create: \"The more detailed your description, the more control you have over the final video.\" It takes 1-2 minutes for the clip to generate. [...] On the safety front, each frame features a SynthID digital watermark. Only available to Gemini Advanced subscribers ($19.99 per month), there is a \"monthly limit\" on how many videos you can generate, with Google notifying users when they're close. It is rolling out globally -- in all languages supported by Gemini -- starting today and will be fully available in the coming weeks. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
