  "text": "As the holiday season is getting closer, StackSocial is offering an exceptional early Black Friday deal for anyone looking to equip their computer with a comprehensive office suite at a very soft price. The well-known US retailer renowned for its discounted software offerings is currently running an incredible discount on Microsoft Office Pro 2021. For just $69 instead of the regular price of $219, which is a substantial 75% discount, you can secure a lifetime license for this complete suite on Windows. This offer includes all the essential applications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, Publisher and Access. Unfortunately the Mac version is sold out. See at StackSocial What makes this deal appealing is that it provides an official license sold through an authorized Microsoft reseller. Unlike Microsoft 365 subscriptions that require ongoing payments, this lifetime license allows you to use the software indefinitely without any additional fees. It’s an excellent alternative for those who prefer a one-time purchase over a subscription model. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, Publisher and Access Office Professional 2021 comes packed with new features and improvements: Excel users will appreciate new functions like XLOOKUP for quick information retrieval, LET for assigning names to calculation results, and XMATCH for searching specific items in arrays. PowerPoint offers an improved Record Slide Show capability including ink and laser pointing recordings. Outlook has gained the ability to translate messages into more than 70 languages and features a new Instant Search to help find emails quickly. The suite also introduces real-time collaborative editing across its applications, allowing team members to work simultaneously on documents when connected to OneDrive. This feature is particularly valuable in today’s increasingly remote work environment. Additionally, Microsoft Teams (free version) is now seamlessly integrated throughout the software and facilites chat and video communication without leaving your document. Installation is straightforward and quick: once you purchase the software on StackSocial, you will receive an activation code via email along with installation instructions. Just ensure that your operating system is compatible: Windows 10 or 11 for the PC version with a minimum of 4GB RAM and 4GB of available disk space. This early Black Friday offer from StackSocial is a unique opportunity to acquire a complete and powerful office suite at a fraction of its usual price. Whether you’re a student, a freelancer or simply looking for effective tools for personal use, now is the perfect time to invest in Microsoft Office Pro 2021. See at StackSocial",
