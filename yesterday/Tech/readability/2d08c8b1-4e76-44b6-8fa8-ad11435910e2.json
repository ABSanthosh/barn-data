Listen, if we're going to have robots in our homes, why not make them adorable little baby robots that drive around and you can cuddle with them. This is Amy, a concept from TCL that is a companion robot that is designed for a kid in the house to chat with, to play with, and also it's kind of tapped into all the smart home things that you might have with TCL already. So it's kind of like a smart home control center. That your kid can play with and be able to document their day through vlogs and just be a little buddy and how could you be mad at a robot with AI getting all of this information about you when it's so cute. Here are the cameras up here and it has screens for eyes and it's just the cute faces, a lot of the cute faces, and this also, it's little mobility pram situation has a lot of different sensors in it as well as it rolls around. Your house. I've been seeing more little robot companions designed for kids that use AI. We've seen things like Moxie, for example, where you can have conversations back and forth, but here in TCL's concept, it also is tapped into like maybe your smart security system. It's tapped into what's going on in the car. It knows the temperature in the home. You know, if you're not home, maybe you want to drive it around and have it be an extra set of eyes on the house. What do you take it out of this carriage. It's Eyes blink, its arms flap, and he uses his cameras to somehow communicate with you. I've seen a lot of robots that are companions that roll around your house every year at CES. They usually all concepts, but no concept before has had outfits. Yes, you can dress up Amy. We have a green model, perhaps a cosmic model, dressing up like a penguin. Why wouldn't you dress up your robots like penguins? We need more of that in this world because it brings joy, right? Anyways, the whole point is that because it's for kids, they're gonna want to play. With it and give it its own little personality too. All these sensors and the AI coming together, it's going to learn and grow with you over time. And when you can't bring Amy along with you, there's even a little pin you can detach and take with you. That's a camera. So Amy kind of knows what you're doing when Amy can't be there. That way you have some sort of instant on the go memory sinking going on. It's the cutest AI robot ever. It's really light and it has sparkly eyes and. Your heart, if you think this is quirky. Yes, you are right, it is quirky, but we are seeing more robots that are designed for kids to interact with with AI smarts in it so you can have conversations and it kind of becomes a little best friend, a little buddy. Aside from being adorable. Oh, his little arms are going, his arms are growing. It can control your smart home. So yeah, why don't we make this the smart home home? Like a little, a little baby, a little baby robot. I can't get mad at a baby robot. 00, he's sleepy. Oh, I'm sorry. Why do I wanna do this? What do I wanna do this? Would you like to go back in your prayer? 00, here you go, buddy. There you go. He just snaps right in. You know, I've always kind of wondered where we're going with all these robots that are rolling around the house, and I'm down with this. Let's, let's make them small, cute, and adorable and see where that goes. What do you think? Let us know in the comments if you would adopt a little buddy, Amy. Thanks for watching.",
