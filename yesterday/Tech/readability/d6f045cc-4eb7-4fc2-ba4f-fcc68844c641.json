  "text": "This year’s Oscar nominations went all in on genre, and Wicked star Cynthia Erivo is up for a leading actress statue. Cinema’s Wicked Witch of the West was on Jimmy Kimmel recently and the late night host revealed Erivo was on a plane when the announcement was made. “True to form. I was defying gravity,” Erivo laughed. “I didn’t mean it to be that way, but the universe does what the universe does.” In this case we’re hoping it fulfills her destined EGOT, if not for Wicked than for the upcoming Wicked: For Good. Wicked has quickly become a fan-favorite pick for awards with people from all ages being inspired by the Witches of Oz. There are countless TikTok recreations of Ariana Grande’s “What Is This Feeling?” choreography—and apparently, many folks have taken it upon themselves to recreate Erivo’s take on Elphaba’s “war cry” at the end of “Defying Gravity” in front of the star. Kimmel asked if people would corner her with their versions of the intricate note. “They just sometimes just go straight into it,” she shared about experiencing the Wicked fandom in the wild, which is something she’s still figuring out how to react to. “Sometimes it’s really delightful. Sometimes it’s really, really wonderful. And I think what’s lovely is that people are willing to try anyway. I think if the emotion has moved you to do that without even introducing yourself, then I think we’ve done something right, and I’m just gonna go with it.” Finding her voice as Elphaba to stand apart from Wicked‘s OG Elphie Idina Menzel and The Wizard of Oz’s Wicked Witch of the West, Margaret Hamilton, was very important to Erivo. “I wanted to make sure that I used the music as though it was the emotional heartbeat throughout her story. So I wanted to make sure that she grew within the songs … you can’t be at ‘Defying Gravity’ right at the beginning,” Erivo explained. “She has to kind of grow to get there.” She continued, adding in singing for emphasis. “When the first time you really hear her sing, it’s ‘The Wizard and I.’ So ‘The Wizard and I’ has more youth in the sound. And then later on you have ‘I’m Not That Girl,’ which is a little bit more wistful and there’s more heartbreak before you get to ‘Defying Gravity,’ which has more ground in it. And [then] with ‘Defying Gravity,’ in the beginning it’s like a cry, it’s grounded.” Erivo’s own Wicked work has been recognized this awards season, but there are homages to the original Oz witch, like her claws—and of course a tease at her own version of the classic cackle. “You heard a little bit in the first [movie],” she said of the moment she sneaks it into a giggle fit during “What Is this Feeling?” and added “You’ll hear it in the second one for sure.” Kimmel went on to share he was afraid of the original Wicked Witch of the West, and Erivo turned the tables. “Do you think it was because of the Wizard of Oz that you were scared of Margaret Hamilton?” she asked, speaking to Hamilton’s legendary performance, which Erivo always fittingly admired. “I don’t think I ever experienced feeling afraid of her. Maybe that’s the reason I’m here.” Watch the whole Wicked interview segment here: Wicked is out now in theaters and digital. Wicked: For Good opens this Thanksgiving. Want more io9 news?
