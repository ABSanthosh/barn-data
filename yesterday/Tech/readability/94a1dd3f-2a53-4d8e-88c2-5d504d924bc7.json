  "text": "Retro Remake’s Taki Udon announced last night that preorders had opened for the SuperStation One, a clone of the PS One variant of the original PlayStation. The $149.99 Founders Edition preorders are sold out already, but you can still preorder the standard $225 SuperStation One for $179.99 right now, with shipping expected in “Q4 or Earlier.” While the SuperStation One looks like a PS One — complete with ports compatible with the original PlayStation controller and memory cards — it plays more than just PlayStation 1 games. It’s a custom MiSTER field-programmable gate array (FPGA) machine, as Polygon points out. That means rather than emulating game consoles, its hardware can actually function just like those consoles, with cores ranging from the Atari 5200 and NES to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. Retro Remake currently offers the system in black, gray, and translucent blue. It comes with a 64GB Micro SD card and has three USB-A ports, an ethernet port, and an NFC reader that you can use to trigger specific games to load. It uses USB-C for power.On the video side of things, the SuperStation One will have an HDMI port, along with VGA, DIN10, composite, and component ports geared for retro gaming setups. You’ll also find a 3.5mm audio jack and a digital audio port. Finally, there’s an expansion slot to support Retro Remake’s planned SuperDock accessory that adds a slot-loading disc drive, a 2280 m.2 SSD bay, and four more USB-A ports. That’s not up for preorder yet, but you can put down a $5 preorder deposit for it with an order of the SuperStation One.This is Retro Remake’s first console, though the company plans to make more later, as Udon told Time Extension last week. The company has released other products, including a DIY kit for upgrading the Nintendo Switch Lite to an OLED display.",
