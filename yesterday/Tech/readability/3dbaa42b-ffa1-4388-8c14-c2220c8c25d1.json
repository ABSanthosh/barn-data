  "text": "Picking out a running shoe is a different experience than shopping for other types of footwear. For one, everyone has different preferences as far as style goes and their running needs. Some shoe brands are known to make shoes for specific types of running (trail, speed, daily), and you may notice some will market themselves as minimalist, maximalist or in-between sneakers. Running shoes, like walking shoes, can also be versatile enough to use for different activities. The only difference is that running shoes are designed to withstand the rigorous nature of running, but they can work well as walking shoes since you need similar support. Paul Nasri, who holds a doctorate in physical therapy and works at The Game Plan Physical Therapy in New York, says the most important thing to be aware of is the type of running you are trying to do and the distances you are interested in running. \"For example, if you are doing speed work, that sneaker should be lighter weight and slightly more minimalist, whereas if you are performing a long run, it should have more support and be slightly more maximalist,\" he explained. On the other hand, if you are focusing more on tempo work or short easy runs, you can choose a medium support type of sneaker. Knowing how often you'll be using the running shoe is also important because someone running just a few miles a week doesn't need the same qualities as someone who is training for a marathon. \"No matter the case, you should always be rotating between two sneakers when performing your regular running throughout the week,\" Nasri advised.Two key qualities to look out for in a running shoe are a supportive heel counter and space in the forefoot region. \"You want to make sure the heel counter is supportive and that your heel isn't moving much, but you also want to make sure that the sneaker breaks from the forefoot region, where your toes normally would go into extension,\" Nasri said. \"Many sneakers now have carbon plates in the sneaker and that can make for an easier run since that plate facilitates a spring when pushing off, decreasing the amount of energy required for you to propel yourself forward.\"The best way to find the right style is by visiting a running sneaker store and getting fitted for a shoe. You'll then need to give yourself a trial period to walk and run in the shoes to see if they're the best for you. Nasri said, \"Be sure that the toe box is wide enough for your foot -- if you are seeing red marks on the side of your big toe or little toe, that shoe is too tight for you.\" Nasri advises looking at the toe box height as well because if the tops of your toes are red or pink after a run, that means the toe box is too low and you are experiencing too much friction. \"There should be one thumb-width of space in front of your big toe because that will make sure that the front of your toes don't press up into the front of the sneaker, especially when running downhill,\" he added. Knowing your running styleAnother thing to consider when breaking in a new running shoe is whether it's working for or against your gait. One measurement that makes a big difference is the heel-to-toe drop, which is the measurement (in millimeters) of the difference in height from the back of the sneaker to the front of the sneaker. Shoes can have a zero drop (a flat sneaker), low drop (1 to 4mm heel drop), medium drop (5 to 9mm drop) or a high drop (9 to 10mm or higher drop). The heel-to-toe drop you choose will depend on whether you plan on aiming for short, medium or long distances. You should also take your natural strike pattern into account. Nasri advises against using zero-drop or minimalist sneakers for medium and longer-distance running since they can significantly alter your natural strike pattern. If you're a natural heel striker, you'll want a shoe that has more cushioning in the heel, which Nasri says usually has a greater heel-to-toe drop. Natural midfoot strikers can get away with low to medium-heel drop shoes if they prefer. Forefoot strikers may want a lower heel-to-toe drop, but they're the rare group that can pick just about any sneaker that feels comfortable for them.\"I don't encourage changing your natural foot strike pattern on your own, as it changes force distribution throughout the body and can result in overload injuries,\" warned Nasri. Instead he recommends working with a running coach or qualified physical therapist or strength and conditioning coach if you want to focus on changing your foot strike mechanics. The good news is you don't have to change the way you run since there isn't enough evidence that your foot type increases injury risk. Supinated vs. pronated feetYou may be more prone to certain conditions depending on your foot type: supinated or pronated. Supinated feet tend to place more weight on the outside of the foot, whereas people with pronated feet place more weight on the inside of the arch of the foot. You need both supination and pronation when running -- the issue is when your feet overpronate or over-supinate because that can make you more prone to lower extremity injuries. \"People with excessively supinated and pronated feet may be more at risk for plantar fasciopathy,\" said Nasri. Runners with excessive supination are more prone to foot stress fractures (or cracks in the bone) while those with excessive pronation are more prone to posterior tibial tendinopathy or pain on the inside of the ankle due to overuse. \"The only time I care about this as a physical therapist is when there is a clear asymmetry between the left and right foot, and the side in question is presenting with pathology,\" Nasri said. Overall, he suggests selecting a sneaker that feels comfortable and supportive to you, without getting too focused on marketing terms such as \"stability,\" \"motion control\" and \"overpronation\" sneakers.",
