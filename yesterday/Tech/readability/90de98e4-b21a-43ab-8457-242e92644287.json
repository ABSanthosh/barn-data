  "text": "One of 2025's biggest video game surprises might be getting the film treatment.Variety reported that the media company Story Kitchen is shopping the rights for a movie adaptation of Hazelight Studios' Split Fiction. The game, which launched just a few weeks ago at the beginning of March, has been a smash hit, selling two million copies in its first week on the market. There are no named directors, writers, or actors attached to the project yet, so hold your horses on getting too excited, but at the very least, it sounds like Hollywood studios are interested. Split Fiction is a co-op action-adventure game starring two women who get trapped in virtual worlds modeled after stories they've written as part of an evil plot by a big corporation to steal their work. The game has been critically acclaimed for its clever use of split-screen co-op gameplay, though critics have also pointed out weaknesses in Split Fiction's writing. That's an interesting combination of properties for a game that's being adapted to film. One has to wonder how the most compelling part of the game would translate to a motion picture. Mashable Top Stories As always, take announcements like this with a grain of salt. Movie adaptations of video games are announced all the time, but many never come to pass. A Metal Gear Solid movie starring Oscar Isaac has been \"in the works\" for a long time, with no meaningful updates on its progress in years. A studio buying the rights to something doesn't necessarily mean it's going to get made. Still, this is a sign, if nothing else, that original IPs can still succeed in the world of video games.",
