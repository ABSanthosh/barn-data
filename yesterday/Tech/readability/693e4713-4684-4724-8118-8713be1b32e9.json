  "text": "When The Fantastic Four: First Steps hits theaters later this year, it’ll mark the fourth time something has happened in a row. Four times over the past four decades a newly rebooted Fantastic Four movie has been made. And, if you can believe it, they’ve all happened almost exactly 10 years apart. Does that bode well for this new film or does it point to a newly rebooted film coming in 2035? Let’s break it down. Arguably the most famous Fantastic Four movie to date is the one released in July 2005. Directed by Tim Story, it starred Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, and Michael Chiklis as Marvel’s first family. Despite mixed reviews, it was a big enough hit to get a sequel in 2007 with Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. That was not a hit through and, alas, this iteration of the Fantastic Four was dead (until Evans resurfaced in Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine of course). Ten years (and one month) later, in August 2015, a new version of the team was revealed. It was directed by Josh Trank, and Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, and Jamie Bell played the group this time around. The film had its moments but a troubled production ended up manifesting on screen, and in the end, the film was a critical and financial failure. Now it’s been another 10 years and in July again, yet another Fantastic Four team is on the way. Directed by Matt Shankman, this time the group is comprised of Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach. The difference now, however, is that since Disney bought Fox, these Fantastic Four are part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And no, we didn’t forget about the OG. Roger Corman’s Fantastic Four film never got an official release due to rights issues, but it first hit the public consciousness in the summer of 1994. That throws off our “exactly 10 years” hypothesis, but only by a few months. So, aside from the oddity that, since the 1990s, new Fantastic Four teams have introduced in movies almost exactly a decade apart (1994, 2005, 2015, and 2025 respectively), what does this say about the franchise? It’s pretty obvious, is it not? None of the creative teams behind the scenes have nailed the alchemy that has made the comic book characters, who originated in 1961, so successful. But maybe, just made, the fourth time will be the charm. At least we hope so. What do you think? Want more io9 news?
