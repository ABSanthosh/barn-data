  "text": "The Severance season two finale is here and it is epic. Not just in length, running about 75 minutes long, but in everything else too. Friday, we’ll have the standard recap as well as a spoiler-filled interview with Severance’s head writer and showrunner, Dan Erickson. Now though, so much happens in this finale that we wanted to give you all a place to nerd out about it as soon as possible. So here it is. We’re going to talk some spoilers below and we encourage you to do the same in the comments under that. But be sure to check back Friday morning for our detailed recap breaking down every curiosity as well as the interview. Again, I don’t want to step on my toes too much here since I spent a long, long time doing the recap so here are just a few “Wow” things that come to mind for discussion below. How awesome was it to see the two Marks conversing? That was a great way to do that. Also, did Harmony Cobel just up and explain Macrodata refining and Cold Harbor to Mark? Yes, yes she did. It was the first of many answers the episode gave us. Moving on. I’m going to need Apple to release prints of the new painting on the severed floor. That thing is awesome. Horrifying and creepy, but awesome. Those are all words that can describe Jame Eagan too. How fantastic was the Dylan scene? It was sad to see him return because of its implications but that went as well as one could’ve hoped. Plus, it was great to have him down there because, well, everything else. Mark finishes Cold Harbor while being watched by a creepy Kier statue, a roast battle ensues, Lumon has a severed department that’s a marching band, and did we really get the answer about the goats? Yes, yes we did. There were also some brutally violent action scenes, the full reveal of Cold Harbor’s impact on Gemma, and the devastating final moments where Mark is torn between his innie and his outtie in the persons of Helly and Gemma. And then the choice he made? Very noble but, ultimately, maybe too optimistic? A little short-sighted? All things to discuss below in full spoiler mode and we’ll have much, much more in the coming days. Want more io9 news?
