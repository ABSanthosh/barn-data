Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication. Credit: Surfshark If you’ve been meaning to try a VPN but keep putting it off because of price tags and commitment anxiety, this Surfshark deal might break your cycle. StackSocial is offering a three-year subscription to the Surfshark VPN Starter Plan for $83.99, but with code SURF20, it drops to $67.20 through today, March 27. That’s about $1.86 per month, which is a serious markdown compared to Surfshark’s heavily discounted $59.13 per year. The catch is that it’s for new users only, but if you qualify, it’s one of the cheapest ways to get solid privacy tools without skimping on performance.This isn’t one of those “starter” plans that’s stripped down to the bone: You still get AES-256 encryption (the stuff banks use), a kill switch for emergencies, and unlimited device connections, which means you can throw it on your phone, laptop, tablet, smart TV—go wild. There’s CleanWeb to block ads and malware, a cookie pop-up blocker, and even a tool called Bypasser so you can keep your bank app running normally while everything else goes through the VPN. The speeds are promising, too, thanks to upgraded 10 Gbps servers and support for WireGuard and OpenVPN protocols. You can access over 3,200 servers in 65 countries, so streaming or checking content abroad should be smooth. What do you think so far? Still, there are a couple of things to note. This deal only gets you access to Surfshark’s Starter plan—not Surfshark One, which bundles in extras like antivirus and breach alerts. Also, if you forget to redeem the code within 30 days, you'll only get store credit instead of a refund. But for anyone mostly looking to bypass geo-restrictions, dodge trackers, and stop websites from following them around the internet, this is a good pick, especially considering you can set it up on FireTV, Linux, Chrome, and all the usual suspects.
