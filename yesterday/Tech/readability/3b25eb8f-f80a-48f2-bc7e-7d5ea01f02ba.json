  "text": "Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will launch on June 26 exclusively for the PlayStation 5, but those who buy a special edition of the game will be able to access it early. The question is, with three special editions available, which version should you get? Death Stranding 2 is the sequel to legendary developer Hideo Kojima's 2019 game, and it improves on every aspect of the original, making it a game that anyone who is remotely interested in it should play. The edition you should purchase will depend on how big of a fan you are of the series.  Watch this: Unboxing the Death Stranding 2 PS5 Controller 00:45What do the Death Stranding 2 pre-order bonuses and early unlocks actually do?The digital content that comes with the Death Stranding 2 editions is primarily for cosmetic purposes. It lets players add a little customization to their equipment. The one early unlock that does give players an advantage is the Machine Gun, since it's a powerful weapon that players wouldn't usually get until around the mid-point of the game. What's in the different Death Stranding 2 editions?To start, there is the Standard Edition, which retails for $70. Kojima ProductionsThe Standard Edition does include some additional digital content:Quokka HologramBattle Skeleton: Silver (LV1, LV2, LV3)Boost Skeleton: Silver (LV1, LV2, LV3)Bokka Skeleton: Silver (LV1, LV2, LV3)Holograms get unlocked the more you play through the game. These holograms can be placed at structures that the main character, Sam, builds and act as a little sign that you were there. Skeletons are an equippable item, and help Sam physically while allowing him to carry more items. The Battle Skeleton lets Sam do more damage with physical attacks, the Boost Skeleton helps Sam run faster while carrying a lot of items and the Bokka Skeleton helps Sam climb up certain terrains while being more balanced, so he won't tip over. This content, however, is just a cosmetic color for the Skeleton. It will not unlock the item, since that has to be done by completing missions in the game. Next, there's the Digital Deluxe Edition for $80. Order this edition or the Collector's Edition from Sony, and you'll receive 48-hour early access to play the game before it comes out, which will begin at 12 a.m. ET on June 24 (9 p.m. PT on June 23).  Kojima ProductionsThe Digital Deluxe Edition includes the 48-hour early access and the Skeleton cosmetics, although in this edition, the cosmetics are gold and not silver. This edition also comes with:Machine Gun (MP Bullets) LV1 early unlockQuokka PatchChiral Feline PatchWhy Me? PatchThe Machine Gun is a weapon you get later in the game, and it's a powerful addition thanks to its large magazine filled with bullets. It can also shoot for longer than the Assault Rifle found early in the game. MP Bullets are the standard type of bullets found in the game that can damage humans, BTs and robots. The patches are for Sam's backpack. They are strictly cosmetic and offer no in-game advantage.  Then, for the big fans of Death Stranding, there's the Collector's Edition that costs $230.  Kojima ProductionsThe Collector's Edition comes with all the digital content from the Deluxe Edition as well as some real-life collectibles in a collector's box. It includes: 15-inch Magellan Man Statue3-inch Dollman figurineArt cardsLetter from Hideo KojimaAll of the special editions are available to order now. Should I pre-order Death Stranding 2 for the bonus DLC?The big reason to pre-order Death Stranding 2 is early access so you can play the game early. The other bonus DLC is nice to have, but not really needed in the game.Is the Death Stranding 2 Digital Deluxe Edition bonus content worth it?If you're looking to get a leg up on the game, being able to unlock the Machine Gun early can be worth the price of the Digital Deluxe Edition.",
