  "text": "Everyone experiences a light shedding of hair each day, but there comes a point where it may be concerning and affect your overall hair thickness. However, you may be able to figure out what's causing it to help you come back from it. Some people experience hair loss because of hormones or genetics, while others may need to up their intake of certain vitamins. A balanced diet full of vitamins and minerals can help you achieve healthy locks while boosting your overall health at the same time. It's a win-win. We outlined seven hair-friendly vitamins, along with the foods they're found in, that you should try to incorporate into your diet for potential hair health benefits. However, before changing your diet or adding any supplements, be sure to consult your doctor first.What vitamins are best for hair growth? Vitamins do many amazing things for hair. They can aid in cell growth, prevent free radicals from damaging it, keep it from graying prematurely and nourish the follicles that stimulate growth. Here are the best vitamins for hair growth and thickness.BiotinBiotin, also known as vitamin B7, stimulates the production of keratin to increase follicle growth. Biotin deficiencies tend to be rare, with those diagnosed with Biotinidase deficiency being the most common. You can find this vitamin in many foods, including eggs, meat, fish, nuts, eggs, sweet potatoes and seeds. The recommended intake is 30 micrograms for adults daily.However, one side effect of biotin may be acne breakouts. In this Reddit thread a user posted seeking advice on what vitamins and supplements others use for hair growth, multiple responses have indicated that taking more biotin resulted in acne. Though this may not be the same for everyone, it is something to consider if you do take a biotin supplement. If you do notice more breakouts, then consider one of the other vitamins for healthy hair.Vitamin A Hair cells are the fastest-growing part of the body. It makes sense that vitamin A is the perfect fuel for that growth. When your body absorbs vitamin A, it produces sebum. That's an oily substance that moisturizes your scalp, keeping it and your hair follicles healthy. Having a vitamin A deficiency could result in you experiencing hair loss. To consume more vitamin A, you'll want to eat foods high in beta-carotene, which turns into vitamin A. Foods high in beta-carotene include sweet potatoes, pumpkin, carrots, spinach and kale. You can also find it in cod liver oil, eggs, yogurt and milk.The recommended daily intake for vitamin A is up to 900 mcg for men and 700 mcg for women. Be careful not to take too much vitamin A, as it can have harmful effects and has been linked to birth defects during pregnancy. vaaseenaa/Getty ImagesVitamin C Oxidative stress is one of the main factors contributing to hair loss. This occurs when we have an imbalance of free radicals and antioxidants in our bodies, which can lead to an electron imbalance that could result in hair loss. The solution is to consume foods with vitamin C. Your body possesses antioxidants that curtail free radicals' hair damage by balancing their electrons when you do. Along with balancing the scales, Vitamin C aids your body in producing collagen (prevents hair from graying prematurely) and absorbing iron -- tackling iron deficiency to an extent -- which can help hair grow. Smoking, drinking alcohol and having a poor diet can lead to a vitamin C deficiency.You'll find vitamin C in citrus fruits, peppers, strawberries, tomatoes and guavas. Since your body doesn't produce it, you'll need to include these in your diet or have a supplement with vitamin C. Daily intake for vitamin C is up to 90 milligrams per day for adult men and 75 milligrams for adult women. Taking too much Vitamin C could result in heartburn, muscle cramps, fatigue, skin flushing and possible kidney stones. Vitamin D Vitamin D deficiencies can lead to hair loss conditions like alopecia, female pattern hair loss and excessive shedding. You'll find these depletions more in people aged 65 and over. To get more vitamin D intake, you can incorporate fatty fish, cod liver oil, fortified foods (cereal, eggs, bread, yogurt) and mushrooms into your diet. Alternatively, you can catch some midday sun rays.600 IU of vitamin D is the recommended dosage for adults. Taking too much vitamin D could result in nausea, weight loss, disorientation and heart rhythm issues. Seksak Kerdkanno / 500px / Getty ImagesVitamin E Vitamin E contains the same antioxidant prowess as its vitamin C counterpart possesses.  It means it can curb oxidative stress by balancing out the electron level in free radicals. People more susceptible to vitamin E deficiencies include those with health conditions such as Crohn's disease or cystic fibrosis. Vitamin E is an effective method for treating hair loss. A small study revealed that people taking vitamin E supplements for eight months experienced a 34.5% increase in hair growth. You can also find vitamin E in sunflower seeds, spinach, avocados and almonds. If you plan to go the supplemental route, the recommended dietary allowance is 15 milligrams daily.IronIron fuels the production of hemoglobin, a protein found in your body's red blood cells. These cells distribute oxygen to cells throughout your body, aiding in their repair and growth. An iron deficiency can lead to hair loss, with women being the most susceptible.You'll find iron in foods like eggs, red meat, lentils, spinach, oysters and clams. If your doctor recommends it, you can take an iron supplement. The recommended daily iron intake is 45 mg. Keep in mind that taking too much iron could result in constipation, stomach pain and vomiting.   fcafotodigital/Getty ImagesZinc Zinc promotes hair growth and keeps the oil glands surrounding the follicles working well. If you have a Zinc deficiency, you could experience hair loss. Those most susceptible to zinc deficiencies are those who drink alcohol excessively, people with Crohn's, pregnant or breastfeeding women and those with chronic kidney ailments. You can find zinc in many common foods like beef, spinach, wheat germ, pumpkin seeds, oysters and lentils. The recommended daily dosage of zinc is 11 mg for men and 8 mg for women. Taking too much could result in loss of appetite, cramps and headaches. It can also lower your good cholesterol.How long do hair growth vitamins take to work?Hair supplements are not overnight solutions. It may take months before you'll notice small improvements. Remember that the success rate depends on the cause of the hair loss, your diet, genetics and other factors. Do hair vitamins really work?While hair growth vitamins may work for some, others may not notice a difference. However, consistent use is key to seeing long-term results, so don't expect overnight changes. (And don't invest in products that promise significant results in a short time.)Again, this is a commonly asked question on Reddit. In this particular discussion thread, a guy is asking about what vitamins work for hair growth and thickness, while also giving his nails and skin per his girlfriend's recommendation. One of the replies is a female in her 30's who uses both collagen and biotin and has noticed a significant difference for her hair and nails. Her hair experiences less breakage and feels stronger, while her nails grow much faster. So in addition to the hair growth, some of these supplements can also give you a boost in your skin and nails.Bottom line Vitamins can restore damaged hair, prevent it from aging prematurely, reduce hair loss and improve growth and volume. They're also not a one-size-fits-all solution. You'll want to consult your doctor if you're losing a significant amount of hair, as it may stem from your environment, an underlying medical condition or another factor. They can work with you to create a targeted plan that may include vitamins.Several vitamins and minerals are involved in hair growth by aiding in cell growth and nourishing the follicles. The best vitamins for hair growth are: BiotinVitamin AVitamin CVitamin DVitamin EIronZincThere are several reasons your hair may be falling out, including a vitamin deficiency. You might see hair loss if you’re deficient in vitamin D, biotin, iron, vitamin B12, zinc or vitamin A. It’s best to speak with your doctor, who can help determine precisely what vitamins you’re missing before buying supplements.Other reasons include genetics, side effects of medications or medical conditions. Taking vitamins for hair growth probably won’t help in those cases because they only address nutritional deficiencies. Vitamins for hair growth only work if you’re deficient in key vitamins. Sometimes, changes in your lifestyle and diet can help more than vitamins can. Diets low in calories, fat and protein can result in unhealthy hair and hair loss. You should also work to reduce stress as much as possible, as it can be linked to hair loss. While there are some forms of hair loss that aren't preventable, you can do certain things to keep your hair healthy and minimize the impact.
