We’ve driven vast investments, showcased endless innovations, and made friends along the way. We’ve also learnt from our mistakes. But don’t worry, fellow kids — we’re not getting old yet. We’re still mixing serious business with festival vibes. We are, however, shaking the party up a bit. To celebrate our coming of age, we’re going back to our roots. Today, we’re relaunching TNW Conference with a renewed focus on our founding mission: elevating the startups and scaleups shaping our future. Since 2006, TNW Conference has earned a reputation as a launchpad for world-changing ideas. We make it our thing to introduce startups and scaleups to the right crowd, so big ideas can grow into big things and shake up the world. The 💜 of EU techThe latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!The likes of Slack, Trello, Bolt, and Vinted have graced our stages en route to becoming world leaders. They’ve been joined by a star-studded selection of speakers, from web inventor Sir Tim-Berners Lee and Reddit CEO Steven Huffman to Hollywood star Zoe Saldana and NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.  We’ve also supported 13 of the 15 Dutch unicorns in the early stages of their growth journeys. This year, we want to foster a new generation of tech titans.  “At TNW, we’ve always had a knack for spotting the extraordinary before it becomes the norm,” said Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten, the founder of TNW. “From fledgling startups to transformative technologies, we thrive on helping innovators take their first big leap.” Well, that all sounds lovely, I hear you say, but is there any substance behind your grandiose ambitions? Thanks for asking—and mind your manners. Of course there’s substance. Here’s a taste of what’s in store. What’s new for TNW Conference 2025? For our return to the iconic NDSM venue in Amsterdam on June 19-20, TNW Conference is being transformed into an exclusive, curated, and higher-quality platform. We’re doubling down on the attendee experience — and the element of surprise that’s a become a trademark of the event. Every change intends to maximise our impact. Let’s dig into a few details: Tickets will be restricted to just 4,500 guests. By restricting our numbers, we can create an intimate, tailored experience. The audience has been curated. Over 2,000 startups and scaleups, 675+ investors, 900+ policymakers, and 900+ corporate innovators will be in attendance. We’ve focused our agenda around three key themes: Growth \u0026 Venture, Next in Tech, and Enterprise Innovation. Streamlining the program allows us to provide more relevant content. It also enhances collaboration and actionable insights.  Tech5 returns. The network of top European founders has helped over 585 companies including Wise, Too Good To Go, Picnic, and Revolut. At TNW Conference, the program will feature a competition for the best growth-stage startups. We have a new edition of The Assembly — an invite-only gathering of policymakers and business leaders. Themes for this year’s edition include defence tech — a timely pick with the NATO Summit arriving in Amsterdam one week later. Deep tech, AI, climate tech, and other verticals are also on the agenda. The Corporate Innovator ticket launches. Our new pass will connect corporate leaders with tech pioneers in an exclusive Corporate Lounge. Our vision has been endorsed by our gorgeous home city. This year’s TNW Conference has been chosen as a flagship event of Amsterdam750 — a celebration of the Dutch capital’s 750th birthday. A hand-picked crew of tech leaders has also supported the refreshed plans. Among them is Victoria Slivkoff, the Head of Ecosystem at VC fund Walden Catalyst Venture and Executive Managing Director of the Extreme Tech Challenge. “TNW’s renewed focus on empowering startups driving global impact underscores the transformative power of scalable innovation to create a better world,” she said. “By fostering collaboration, providing unparalleled resources and visibility, TNW is creating a launchpad for visionary entrepreneurs tackling the world’s most pressing challenges.” Why attend TNW Conference 2025? We’ve redesigned TNW Conference for one reason: to better serve European startups, scaleups, and the surrounding ecosystem. Here’s what’s on offer for our community: For Startups \u0026 Scaleups: Showcase your startup on the same platform where today’s tech giant once stood. Gain exposure, connect with industry players, meet investors, and find new clients. For Investors: Unearth tech’s hottest companies. Expand your deal pipeline, connect with high-growth entrepreneurs, and network with fellow investors. For Corporate Innovators: Inject some startup thinking into your enterprise to stay ahead of the curve and learn how to innovate at scale — fast. For Ecosystem Builders: Helping national startups grow into global businesses. Connect key players, foster partnerships, and unearth pioneering innovations. Join us to discover the next big thing — before it’s a thing. The next steps We’ll soon share extra details on the agenda — including our thrilling first batch of speakers and an eye-catching array of partners. In the meantime, Andy Lürling, a founding partner at VC firm Lumo Labs and a TNW Advisory Board member, has a few tips for the event. “The better you prepare for your visit to the conference — by exploring the TNW platform to identify who will be attending, who is relevant for you to meet, and which sessions are most valuable for you — the higher the quality of your experience will be,” he said. “Don’t hesitate to approach people, start conversations spontaneously, ask questions, and share your own experiences, knowledge, and network.” You can join Andy and us at TNW Conference in June. Just don’t call it a comeback — but you can call it a rebirth. Tickets for TNW Conference are now on sale. We’re going to sell-out — so don’t delay in ordering your pass.
