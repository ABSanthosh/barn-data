  "text": "Long admired for its progressive policies and open economy, the Netherlands is making an aggressive play to become Europe’s next tech powerhouse. By blending AI with sustainability and a strong ethical framework, the country attracted $2.5bn in tech investments in 2024 alone — a 39% surge from the previous year. With a government-backed push for responsible innovation, the Netherlands is positioning itself as the epicentre of Europe’s next tech renaissance.  According to VC firm Atomico, the country has become one of Europe’s fastest-growing tech ecosystems. Europe’s leading stock exchange by market cap, Euronext Amsterdam, has become a cornerstone of the country’s digital ecosystem. Tech now accounts for 23% of Euronext Amsterdam’s total market — exceeding the New York Stock Exchange’s 14%.  Ethical AI is a pivotal aspect of the Netherlands’ tech ambitions. Dutch leaders in the space include Kickstart AI, a collaboration among five major Dutch companies — Ahold Delhaize, ING, KLM, NS, and Philips — that focuses on driving ethical AI innovations that align with societal values and can tackle real-world challenges. Another key initiative, GPT-NL, spearheaded by non-profits TNO, NFI, and SURF, aims to ensure transparent and fair AI usage, adhering to Dutch and European principles of data ownership and ethical standards.  The Dutch government has been a key player in these developments. It’s implemented policies that nurture tech growth at every stage — from grants for early-stage startups to tax incentives for R\u0026D activities. Meanwhile, programs like the Dutch Good Growth Fund and the Innovation Box tax scheme encourage businesses to invest in sustainable, high-tech solutions. Last year, the Dutch government unveiled its vision for generative AI, outlining a framework to develop and use this technology responsibly while maintaining control over its societal impacts. The vision is structured around six key action lines: fostering collaboration among stakeholders; closely monitoring AI advancements; developing appropriate legislation and regulations; expanding AI knowledge and skills (particularly through education); experimenting with generative AI within government in a safe and controlled manner; and ensuring strict supervision with enforcement measures when necessary. “It is essential that the Netherlands does not remain stuck on the sidelines when it comes to artificial intelligence,” said Micky Adriaansens, Netherlands’ Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, during a briefing last year. “In particular, generative AI is increasingly developing into one of the most defining technologies of our time, both in everyday life, and for example for application in machines and in more efficient industrial systems. Asia and the US have taken the lead and Europe will have to catch up.” The plans aligns with significant investments — amounting to millions of euros — already made by research institutions, private enterprises, and the government, all focused on keeping pace with the rapid evolution of AI. “The Dutch approach to ethical AI development embodies a distinctly European balance between innovation and privacy rights,” said Krik Gunning, co-founder and CEO of Amsterdam-based digital identity startup Fourthline. “By establishing clear guidelines for data protection and algorithmic transparency through frameworks like the GDPR, Europe has built a foundation of trust crucial for the adoption of AI-driven solutions in the digital identity space.” A sustainable technology plan The government has provided further support by investing heavily in smart cities. Amsterdam and Eindhoven lead the way in deploying IoT technologies, 5G networks, and AI-driven solutions to improve urban living. Another pillar is emerging in the Hague, where a spin-off from the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) recently unveiled plans to build digital twins of smart cities. Gunning added that the partnership between the Dutch government and leading universities in Delft and Eindhoven has also been instrumental in fostering innovation. TU Delft works with the Dutch government, industry partners, and other technical universities to develop materials for sustainable energy sources. TU Eindhoven, meanwhile, is at the heart of the Brainport Eindhoven innovation ecosystem, one of Europe’s leading high-tech regions. “What makes this model particularly effective is its focus on practical innovation — ensuring research translates into real solutions,” Gunning said. “One cool success story of a Dutch university working in partnership with the private sector and the government is ASML.” Moreover, ethical AI development Initiatives like the Dutch AI Coalition aim to create a collaborative environment where industry, academia, and government work together to harness AI responsibly. Another promising sector is sustainability. Collectively, Dutch green tech startups attracted a record $700mn in funding in 2024. Companies such as Voltfang, which focuses on renewable energy storage, and Vind, a pioneer in wind energy optimisation, are emerging leaders in the sector. The country is also experimenting with circular economy models, where waste is minimised and resources are reused.  Anders Indset, chairman of Njordis Group, a VC firm investing in technology companies, says the sustainability advances can boost AI progress.  “The Netherlands has a strong focus on renewable energy, which ensures a sustainable energy supply for the development and training of AI models,” Indset told me. “The availability of eco-friendly energy reduces both costs and environmental impact when training energy-intensive AI systems.”  Retaining AI talent is the Netherlands’ biggest tech hurdle The Netherlands’ pursuit of becoming an innovation leader in Europe is not without its challenges. While the country has become a magnet for investment — with VC funds like Peak Capital and Speedinvest funding high-impact startups, and institutional investors including pension funds increasingly investing in Dutch tech — its ability to retain skilled talent could impede its growth.  Global tech hubs like Silicon Valley and Shenzhen offer highly lucrative opportunities. To compete with them, the Dutch ecosystem must keep innovating and provide compelling incentives to retain top talent. “One of our key competitive advantages in attracting global tech talent has been the tax benefits, which enable us to compete effectively with tech hubs like London, Berlin, and Singapore for top specialists in AI, cybersecurity, and fintech,” Gunning explained. “Most international tech professionals tend to only stay in the Netherlands during their peak working years, typically from their late twenties to early forties.” While Atomico reported that the European ecosystem is home to some 35,000 early-stage companies, growth-stage funding across the ecosystem continues to be a bottleneck, with European startups often turning to the US for large-scale investments. The Netherlands’ ability to scale its companies locally could serve as a model for addressing this challenge. For instance, Dutch fintech Adyen built a strong local foundation before expanding globally. By 2015, it surpassed a $2bn valuation. Likewise, Catawiki evolved from a collector’s platform into a premier auction house for rare finds. After refining its business model in the Netherlands, it scaled internationally, raising €150mn ($155mn) in 2020 to fuel further growth. Indset argues that “stock market processes should be simplified further, and incentives created for top talent to ensure a long-term commitment to the location.” He suggests using the advantage to build a “scale-up ecosystem for capital to hold tech companies in Europe once they reach later-stage financing.” What’s next for the Dutch blueprint? By 2030, startups founded in the Netherlands could potentially contribute an estimated €250bn ($259bn) to €400bn ($414bn) in market capitalisation over the next five years. The Netherlands’ commitment to ethical innovation will also likely shape EU-wide policies, setting benchmarks for responsible tech development. Indset praised the country’s practical priorities. “While European countries have focused on political correctness and ideologies and are more in a reactive mode, the Netherlands seems to understand that uniting ecology and economy, by putting capitalism and growth at the front, does not contradict a value-driven technological future,” he said.
