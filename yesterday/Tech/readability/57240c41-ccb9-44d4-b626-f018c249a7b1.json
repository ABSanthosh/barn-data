  "text": "It’s tempting to imagine Ryan Reynolds just has an alarmingly robust library of deleted and behind-the-scenes Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine clips in his possession; some, he doled out for the Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine home release special features, others, he sprinkled into Marvel’s newly released “Assembled” documentary about the film on Disney+. But the well isn’t dry yet, because he just shared this very fun little moment on social media: An abandoned, half-baked, quasi-edited and never-before-seen-for-good-reason montage featuring the greatest rock band on earth? ‘Kay. pic.twitter.com/JlIKffuKWN — Ryan Reynolds (@VancityReynolds) November 14, 2024 “An abandoned, half-baked, quasi-edited and never-before-seen-for-good-reason montage” (the band: Reynolds’ fellow Canadians, Nickleback) from Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine is not a bad way to spend a minute of your time, as the dynamic duo trudges across the Void’s vast, expansive landscapes. There’s an epic quest feel to the sequence… or there would be, if Deadpool wasn’t nattering on non-stop in his trademark manner. Topics in this mostly one-sided conversation include: Whatever happened between Wolverine and Jean Grey? The trailer for Matthew McConaughey’s bizarro 2003 comedy Tiptoes—enjoying recently revived viral popularity because McConaughey was just featured on the 2 Bears, 1 Cave comedy podcast and cracked up while watching the trailer (he claimed) for the first time. (This joke’s inclusion suggests at least some of Reynolds’ voice-over riffing was recorded very recently.) Deadpool’s proud status as an unreliable narrator Thor crying (still no explanation why) The importance of using only high-quality hair extensions There’s also a piggyback ambush… and the declaration that certain phrases just sound better in an Australian accent. In other words, Deadpool being Deadpool, while also slyly reminding fans they can now watch the hit comedy on Disney+. Want more io9 news?
