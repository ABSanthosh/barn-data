  "description": "TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, fired an intern for \"maliciously interfering\" with the training of one of its AI models. However, the firm \"rejected claims about the extent of the damage caused by the unnamed individual, saying they 'contain some exaggerations and inaccuracies,'\" reports the BBC. From the report: The Chinese technology giant's Doubao ChatGPT-like generative AI model is the country's most popular AI chatbot. \"The individual was an intern with the [advertising] technology team and has no experience with the AI Lab,\" ByteDance said in a statement. \"Their social media profile and some media reports contain inaccuracies.\" Its commercial online operations, including its large language AI models, were unaffected by the intern's actions, the company added. ByteDance also denied reports that the incident caused more than $10 million of damage by disrupting an AI training system made up of thousands of powerful graphics processing units (GPU). As well as firing the person in August, ByteDance said it had informed the intern's university and industry bodies about the incident. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
