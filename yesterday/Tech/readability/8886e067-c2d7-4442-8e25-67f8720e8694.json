This initiative will help local farmers utilize smart-irrigation technology on 20,000 acres across both states.Arable's technology provides farmers with comprehensive real-time data on weather, soil moisture and crop health, allowing for highly precise irrigation decisions. This reduces overall water use and promotes resilient agricultural water management. These projects directly support our goal to replenish 120% of our freshwater consumption by 2030, while also improving watershed health in the communities we call home.We are dedicated to supporting water security in the Carolinas and beyond.
