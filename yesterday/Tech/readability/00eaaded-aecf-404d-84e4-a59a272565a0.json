  "text": "President-elect Donald Trump has selected Andrew Ferguson to be the next chair of the Federal Trade Commission. Ferguson will take over for Lina Khan, who has earned praise from Vice President-elect J.D. Vance for her efforts to fight big tech.“Andrew has a proven record of standing up to Big Tech censorship, and protecting Freedom of Speech in our Great Country,” Trump says in a post on Truth Social. According to a document obtained by Punchbowl News’ Ben Brody, Ferguson’s pitch for the job included intentions to “reverse Lina Khan’s anti-business agenda,” “hold big tech accountable and stop censorship,” and “protect freedom of speech and fight wokeness.” The document also said Ferguson would “fight back against the trans agenda.” Ferguson was first sworn in as an FTC commissioner in April, but Trump says that Ferguson will begin his role as chair on “day one” of his administration.“At the FTC, we will end Big Tech’s vendetta against competition and free speech,” Ferguson writes in a post on X. “We will make sure that America is the world’s technological leader and the best place for innovators to bring new ideas to life.”Trump also announced that he is nominating Mark Meador, currently a partner at an antitrust law firm, to be an FTC commissioner.",
