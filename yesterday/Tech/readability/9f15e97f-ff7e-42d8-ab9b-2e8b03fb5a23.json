  "description": "PC players of Grand Theft Auto V have at long last reached parity with their console brethren. Following an announcement last month, today Rockstar Games has released a PC update with features that for several years had only been available to the latest console generation. It's a free update for anyone who already owned a copy of the hugely popular game. The original version of GTA V has been delisted from PC storefronts in favor of the new Expanded \u0026 Enhanced iteration of the game, which includes a copy of the old Legacy edition. Both Story Mode and Online progress can be migrated to the most recent version. The update includes technical improvements that debuted on the consoles, as well as some PC-specific ray tracing features if the recommended specs are met. There are also some minor additions on content, such as ambient wildlife, photography challenges, new vehicles and access to the GTA+ subscription service. Rockstar Games has been spiffing up several entries in its GTA franchise over the years. It released a trilogy of remasters for Grand Theft Auto III, GTA: Vice City and GTA: San Andreas in addition to providing these upgrades to GTA V and Grand Theft Auto Online. And while fans of the series might enjoy all the nostalgia, it's safe to say that expectations are sky high for the upcoming Grand Theft Auto VI.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/gta-v-finally-gets-its-next-gen-update-on-pc-three-years-after-consoles-234614209.html?src=rss",
