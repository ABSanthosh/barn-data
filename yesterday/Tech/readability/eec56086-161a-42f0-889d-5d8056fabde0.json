  "text": "General — er, President — Thaddeus Ross (Harrison Ford) gets a lot bigger and redder in the new Captain America: Brave New World trailer that Marvel debuted at Disney’s D23 Brazil event. The company also released a second trailer for Thunderbolts, the new superhero team movie that will end the MCU’s phase 5.The Brave New World preview opens on Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) visiting one of the first supersoldiers, Isaiah Bradley (Carl Lumbly), in prison after his attack on the president. Isaiah, who doesn’t seem to remember the attack, warns Sam to “be careful.” The trailer then sets up some heavy tension and intrigue, using a fun splitscreen theme to build to a much more thorough reveal of Ross’ Red Hulk than Marvel did in July. Although it leaves the feeling that he’s the movie’s main villain, it also suggests there’s much more to the story than just “Sam fights a Hulk.” Captain America: Brave New World hits theaters on February 14th.Then there’s the nearly four-minute-long “special look” at Thunderbolts, which offers more of the Thunderbolts working as an actual team, assembled by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) as a super-powered task force of flawed anti-heroes. The movie’s other main characters include Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Ava Starr / Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Alexei Shostakov / Red Guardian (David Harbour), Antonia Dreykov / Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), and John Walker / US Agent (Wyatt Russell). Oh, and Bob (Lewis Pullman), who seems like just a guy until you see him, injury-free despite a shirt that looks like it’s full of bullet holes that might have come from the dozen or so people pointing guns at him.Thunderbolts comes out on May 2nd.",
