  "text": "The Athena spacecraft was not exactly flying blind as it approached the lunar surface one week ago. The software on board did a credible job of recognizing nearby craters, even with elongated shadows over the terrain. However, the lander's altimeter had failed. So while Athena knew where it was relative to the surface of the Moon, the lander did not know how far it was above the surface. An important detail, that. As a result, the privately built spacecraft struck the lunar surface on a plateau, toppled over, and began to skid across the surface. As it did so, the lander rotated at least once or twice before coming to a stop in a small, shadowed crater. \"The landing was kind of like sliding into second base,\" Steve Altemus, chief executive officer of Intuitive Machines, which built the lander, said in an interview Thursday. Cold and lonely It has been a busy and tiring week for the chief of a company that seeks to help lead the development of a lunar economy. Expectations were high for this, the company's second lunar landing attempt after its Odysseus vehicle became the first private spacecraft to ever make a soft landing on the Moon, last year, before toppling over. In some ways, this mission was even more disappointing. Because Athena skidded across the lunar surface, it dredged up regolith. When it came to a stop, some of this material was blown up into the solar panels—already in a sub-optimal location on its side. The spacecraft's power reserves, therefore, were limited. Almost immediately, the team at Intuitive Machines knew their spacecraft was dying. \"We knew we had slid into a slightly shadowed crater, and the temperature was very cold,\" Altemus said. \"The solar arrays had regolith on them, and they weren't charging, the ones pointing up, enough to give us sufficient power to power the heaters to keep it warm enough to survive.\"",
