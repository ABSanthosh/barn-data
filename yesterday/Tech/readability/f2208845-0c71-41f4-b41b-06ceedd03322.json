When students have the resources and tools they need, they can build technology with product inclusion in mind — creating products that serve everyone. That’s why we’re announcing two new ways we’re helping students learn more about product inclusion.Learn more about product inclusion on our new platformWe’re sharing a new dedicated student platform that will help you learn more about product inclusion and equity from experts in the field. There will be dynamic speaker talks, plus a curated set of resources, aimed to provide students with the knowledge and skills to build inclusive products, features, and services. The inaugural talk, \"Introduction to Product Inclusion \u0026 Equity,\" will be held on November 11th, and students can RSVP here to learn more.Join our Product Inclusion \u0026 Equity SummitNext year, we’re holding our second Product Inclusion \u0026 Equity Summit in Sunnyvale, California — and we’re offering undergraduate through PhD students a chance to attend through an essay contest. The summit connects professionals and students alike who are passionate about building equitable products in various industries. One student who attended last year, UCLA undergraduate Genevieve Chin, later went on to teach product inclusion and equity principles within a peer-to-peer machine learning course at her school. We encourage applications from students who are passionate about product inclusion and equity and are driven to advance equitable outcomes across industries. You can learn more about eligibility and deadlines on our website.We hope both our platform and summit can offer students with more resources and opportunities to grow careers in product equity — and foster the next generation of leaders in the space. Providing students with knowledge, resources and opportunities can help them to create a more inclusive and equitable world.",
