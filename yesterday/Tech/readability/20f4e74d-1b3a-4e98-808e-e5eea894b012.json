  "text": "You can finally use it on more than a desk. Credit: Belkin Last year, frequent Apple collaborator Belkin released what might be the most over-the-top phone stand of all time, doubling as a cameraperson to track and record you as you move. The catch? It didn’t come with a tripod—until now.The Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro is a $150 motorized MagSafe phone charger that, in addition to providing standard 15W wireless charging, also works with Apple’s DockKit framework to rotate 360 degrees and tilt 90 degrees so that it can always keep you in frame. It’s intended for livestreamers and vloggers and can automatically follow you around as you present or act out a skit, making it easier to shoot while solo. (That said, you can also use it casually, say to make a FaceTime call).But at just under nine inches tall, its usability out of the box was severely limited. It’s great for shooting from a desk, but if your videos require you to stand up or get further away from your phone’s microphones, it can be a bit trickier to place. That made it difficult to sell to its core influencer audience.You could get around this using third-party solutions, since the stand comes with a standard tripod screw hole on the bottom, but now Belkin is offering a more official answer. Announced during this year’s CES, the Belkin Stage Creator Bundle adds on to the Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with a 5.6-foot tripod and a pair of wearable clip-on microphones. It also comes with a magnetic phone mount, so technically, you could still use the bundle without the tracking stand as well, assuming you don’t need your phone’s camera to follow you around. Credit: Belkin There’s still no word on Android support, although it’s probably not likely, given the tracking stand’s reliance on DockKit. Even if you put a MagSage sticker on your Android phone, it just won’t play well with its software.Pricing is MIA for the moment, as are specs for those clip-on microphones, as the bundle’s release is a bit far out. (It's currently set for May.) Still, even if it’ll have to compete with third-party alternatives (tripods and wireless mics aren’t exactly new), the bundle will go a long way towards making Belkin’s motorized stand feel like a more complete product. Credit: Belkin Also set for May is the Stage PowerGrip, which is similarly still waiting on a price. This is a bit more of a novelty product, as it’s a MagSafe power bank that also makes your phone look a bit more like an instant camera. Completing the aesthetic (yes, it does come in multiple colors) is a grip for lining up your shots as well as a button for taking them, but where a camera viewfinder would be, you’ll instead find a small screen depicting the bank’s remaining battery percentage. Like some other MagSafe Belkin power banks, you can also stand up the PowerGrip vertically to use it as a sort of phone kickstand as well, and it has a built-in USB-C cable for wired charging. Credit: Belkin Belkin does also have some CES 2025 products with pricing already announced. In addition to a new BoostCharge Compact USB-C wall charger and new BoostCharge Power Bank with 20,000 mAh of capacity and an integrated USB-C cable, the BoostCharge Pro Magnetic Wireless Charging Pad is a small wireless charging puck that should be great for travel. This small circular charger connects to the back of your phone using MagSafe (or a MagSafe style sticker) and is about as thick as a power bank, but takes up much less space overall. Because of its integrated kickstand, the idea is you can easily use it as your phone charger while on-the-go, propping your phone up overnight so it can work like an alarm clock. The only catch? You’ll still need to plug its 6.6-foot USB-C cable into some kind of power source. Luckily, you can get a power supply with the unit, or forgo one for a supply already have, so you at least have options there.The BoostCharge Pro Magnetic Wireless Charging Pad will release in the U.S. in April and will run you $20 without a power supply and $30 with one. If you do want to provide your own power supply, the BoostCharge Compact USB-C charger will work for that, and will release in March for $30, coming with 45W of max capacity and one USB-C port. A 65W version of the BoostCharge Compact will also start selling in March for $40, while the BoostCharge Power Bank with 20,000 mAh capacity and an integrated cable hits shelves in April for $50. The USB-powered products should work with any product that charges via a compatible port, while the BoostCharge Pro Magnetic Wireless Charging Pad will work with any Qi2 compatible device.
