  "text": "Tech startup Kuva Space is working with the Finnish Environmental Institute (Skye) to analyse the health of the Nordic country’s waters with a specialised satellite.  The pilot test will harness Kuva’s hyperspectral sensors, which can analyse a wider light spectrum than traditional sensors. From space, the company’s probe can read the spectral signatures of almost any material on Earth — including toxic cyanobacteria. Also known as blue-green algae, these tiny organisms proliferate in Finland’s lakes and seas during summer. In high concentrations, they can be harmful and even fatal to humans and other animals.  However, cyanobacteria are visually indistinguishable from other, harmless algal blooms. The most accurate way to monitor them currently is to take water samples, which is time-consuming and expensive.     Kuva and Skye are exploring a potentially better alternative. The partners are training AI models on hyperspectral satellite imagery, as well as water samples and insights from biochemical and genetic research.  Over time, the algorithms are expected to become more and more accurate at tracking cyanobacteria and decoding what’s driving their spread. “We’re very excited about this pilot with Kuva Space because rather than just detecting the presence of algae, we can use Kuva’s hyperspectral technology and AI to explore the spectral range and take a step further in identifying which algae species are present and assessing their biomass,” said Jenni Attila, leading researcher \u0026 group manager at Skye.  Kuva launched its first satellite, Hyperfield-1A, in August 2024. By 2030, the startup plans to have 100 satellites in orbit. From orbit, the probes will analyse the chemical compositions of natural and manmade materials.  In addition to spotting harmful algal blooms, the technology can be tuned in orbit for various other use cases. The agricultural sector, for instance, can optimise the sensors to monitor crops. Defence ministries can tap the data for surveillance. Industrial sites can deploy the imagery to detect chemical leaks. In marine ecosystems, the tech can track aquatic species, water quality, and illegal fishing vessels.
