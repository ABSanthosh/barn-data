Since 2018, exploreCSR has supported 237 initiatives across 140 universities spanning 23 countries, reaching over 19,700 students. Grounded in evidenced-based practices and inspired by Carnegie Mellon University’s OurCS, exploreCSR was launched to support faculty worldwide to foster inclusive environments where students from historically marginalized groups (HMGs) could gain the skills, confidence and motivation to pursue computing research pathways.Faculty funded by exploreCSR have not only led on-campus workshops and mentorship programs, but also provided research experiences for undergraduates, leading to significant improvements in student confidence, belonging and intersectional capital in computing research, ultimately predicting their persistence in the field. Through exploreCSR, immersive research experiences have been shown to build community, equity and inclusion for students from HMGs, particularly fostering a positive research culture for undergraduate women. The program's impact extends beyond statistics, evident in the countless stories of students discovering their passion for research and faculty finding ways to sustain their efforts beyond the program's funding.For these efforts to create lasting change, faculty need funding, access to communities of practice and department-level support to fuel and sustain their efforts.That’s why today we’re announcing $2 million in funding to support 22 exploreCSR recipients. We aim to build upon past successes to catalyze long-term, systemic change within university departments, creating a lasting legacy of inclusion and support for HMG students. Today’s funds represent exploreCSR’s shift from supporting single faculty-led initiatives to a focus on enabling sustained department-level efforts with increased funding and support.We believe these institutions are well-positioned to continue the program’s remarkable journey, serve as a model for others, and make a lasting impact on the computing research landscape.We are also hopeful that other philanthropic, public and private funders join us by investing in long-term, meaningful outcomes that lead to a future where computing research truly reflects the diversity of our world.",
