Major manufacturers and retailers have published some giant deals so we can save some money on ourselves or on gifts for our friends, family, and loved ones this holiday season. If you still haven’t picked out your gifts this year yet, now is the weekend to do it. Amazon has a ton of great stuff on sale just about anyone can appreciate. Amazon has its Fire Max 11 tablet with 128 GB of storage on sale for 43% off. This Black Friday deal brings the price down from $280 to the new low price of just $160. That’s a savings of $120. See at Amazon The Amazon Fire Max 11 is available in either 64 GB or 128 GB, but this deal is specifically for the 128 GB model. The 43% discount actually brings the tablet down close to the price of the 64 GB model. The 64GB does have a sale going on but it is not a Black Friday deal, pricing it at $155. The 128 GB model is down to $160, making it only $5 more to double your storage capacity. Additionally, this is for the model without lockscreen ads.
