  "text": "Samsung is gearing up to debut its next slate of foldable Galaxy Z phones, which likely includes follow-ups to last year's Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6. The company will host an Unpacked event in July, where it'll show off its latest devices and Galaxy AI updates. The event will take place in Brooklyn, New York, and will be live streamed on the Samsung Newsroom, at Samsung.com and on Samsung's YouTube channel. Unpacked kicks off on Wednesday, July 9, at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET. Samsung has been teasing its upcoming foldables for the last several weeks. In early June, a Samsung Newsroom post pointed to the company bringing \"an Ultra-experience\" to \"a smaller and more portable form factor.\" That apparently includes a \"powerful camera\" and \"AI-powered tools.\"The following week, the company said in another blog post that its \"newest Galaxy Z series is the thinnest, lightest and most advanced foldable yet.\" It appears to be following in the footsteps of the slim and lightweight Galaxy S25 Edge, which was released in May. Samsung seems to be especially focused on scaling the capabilities of its foldables' cameras with the help of AI. It noted in a subsequent blog post, \"The camera will only get smarter -- helping users capture life's moments more vividly and make everyday experiences more seamless, personal and impactful.\" SamsungAn animated invite for July's Unpacked event begins by showing the slim side profile of a device that then splits into two phones. One of these phones folds like a book, and on-screen text at the end reads \"Ultra Unfolds.\" It's possible Samsung could unveil the Galaxy Z Flip 7, Z Fold 7 and then the Z Fold Ultra. There are also murmurs of a more affordable Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE phone. Leaker Evan Blass shared renders of the rumored device, which appears similar to the Galaxy Z Flip 6, but the phone could swap out the Snapdragon chip for an Exynos processor. Meanwhile, renders of the flagship foldable Galaxy Z Flip 7 suggest Samsung could nix the physical camera notch and opt for an edge-to-edge cover display. But we'll have to wait and see what the company has in store.There have also been rumors about the Galaxy Watch 8 making its debut at Unpacked, though Samsung hasn't yet been teasing its wearables like it has its foldable phones. If you're eager to get the upcoming Galaxy device, you can reserve it now and earn a $50 Samsung Credit at Samsung.com.
