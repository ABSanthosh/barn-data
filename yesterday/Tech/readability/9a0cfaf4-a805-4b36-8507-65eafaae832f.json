  "description": "Google has partnered with Elementl Power to develop at least 600 MW of nuclear capacity at each of three planned sites. It's unknown where the three proposed sites will be located or how much Google is investing. World Nuclear News reports: The two companies will work \"with utility and regulated power partners to identify and advance new projects\" and Elementl \"will continue the evaluation of potential technology, engineering, procurement and construction, and other project partners, while prioritising specific sites for accelerated development.\" Elementl Power, founded in 2022, describes itself as a technology-agnostic advanced nuclear project developer which aims to provide \"turn-key development, financing and ownership solutions for customers that want access to clean baseload power but may not want to own or operate nuclear power assets.\" It says its mission is to \"to deploy over 10 gigawatts of next-generation nuclear power in the US by 2035.\" It is not Google's first nuclear power deal -- in October 2024 the company signed an agreement with Kairos Power to purchase power from its fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature small modular reactors, with a fleet of up to 500 MW of capacity by 2035. The aim of the power purchase agreement was to facilitate Kairos Power to develop, construct, and operate plants and sell energy, ancillary services, and environmental attributes to Google. At the time of that announcement Google said that it would help it achieve net-zero emissions across all of its operations and value chain by 2030.
