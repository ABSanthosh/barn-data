  "description": "For weeks Signal has been one of the three most-downloaded apps in the Netherlands, according to a local news site. And now \"Higher education institutions in the Netherlands have been looking for an alternative,\" according to DUB (an independent news site for the Utrecht University community): Employees of the Utrecht University of Applied Sciences (HU) were recently advised to switch to Signal. Avans University of Applied Sciences has also been discussing a switch...The National Student Union is concerned about privacy. The subject was raised at last week's general meeting, as reported by chair Abdelkader Karbache, who said: \"Our local unions want to switch to Signal or other open-source software.\" Besides being open source, Signal is a non-commercial nonprofit, the article points out — though its proponents suggest there's another big difference. \"HU argues that Signal keeps users' data private, unlike WhatsApp.\" Cybernews.com explains the concern: In an interview with the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, Meredith Whittaker [president of the Signal Foundation] discussed the pitfalls of WhatsApp. \"WhatsApp collects metadata: who you send messages to, when, and how often. That's incredibly sensitive information,\" she says.... The only information [Signal] collects is the date an account was registered, the time when an account was last active, and hashed phone numbers... Information like profile name and the people a user communicates with is all encrypted... Metadata might sound harmless, but it couldn't be further from the truth. According to Whittaker, metadata is deadly. \"As a former CIA director once said: 'We kill people based on metadata'.\" WhatsApp's metadata also includes IP addresses, TechRadar noted last May: Other identifiable data such as your network details, the browser you use, ISP, and other identifiers linked to other Meta products (like Instagram and Facebook) associated with the same device or account are also collected... [Y]our IP can be used to track down your location. As the company explained, even if you keep the location-related features off, IP addresses and other collected information like phone number area codes can be used to estimate your \"general location.\" WhatsApp is required by law to share this information with authorities during an investigation... [U]nder scrutiny is how Meta itself uses these precious details for commercial purposes. Again, this is clearly stated in WhatsApp's privacy policy and terms of use. \"We may use the information we receive from [other Meta companies], and they may use the information we share with them, to help operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services and their offerings,\" reads the policy. This means that yes, your messages are always private, but WhatsApp is actively collecting your metadata to build your digital persona across other Meta platforms... The article suggests using a VPN with WhatsApp and turning on its \"advanced privacy feature\" (which hides your IP address during calls) and managing the app's permissions for data collection. \"While these steps can help reduce the amount of metadata collected, it's crucial to bear in mind that it's impossible to completely avoid metadata collection on the Meta-owned app... For extra privacy and security, I suggest switching to the more secure messaging app Signal.\" The article also includes a cautionary anecdote. \"It was exactly a piece of metadata — a Proton Mail recovery email — that led to the arrest of a Catalan activist.\" Thanks to long-time Slashdot reader united_notions for sharing the article.
