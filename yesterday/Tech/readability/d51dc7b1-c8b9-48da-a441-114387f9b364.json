  "text": "Loud White Guys for Kamala! Vice President Kamala Harris has been stacking up celebrity endorsements from Beyoncé to Eminem to Taylor Swift. Today, she got the roaring support of Will Ferrell and Billy Eichner, who are representing the voting block known as Loud White Men For Harris. A cheeky parody of Megan Thee Stallion's \"Hotties for Harris\" rallying cry, Eichner returned to the sidewalks of New York City with a reprisal of his Billy on the Street schtick. Ambushing pedestrians with hard-hitting questions like \"Who are you voting for?\" and \"Would you have sex with a Trump voter?\" Make no mistake, Eichner's passion for his candidate won't curb his signature acerbic wit!
