Liftoff of SpaceX's seventh full-scale test flight of the Super Heavy/Starship launch vehicle on January 16. Credit: SpaceX The seventh test flight of SpaceX's gigantic Starship rocket came to a disappointing end a little more than two weeks ago. The in-flight failure of the rocket's upper stage, or ship, about eight minutes after launch on January 16 rained debris over the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Atlantic Ocean. Amateur videos recorded from land, sea, and air showed fiery debris trails streaming overhead at twilight, appearing like a fireworks display gone wrong. Within hours, posts on social media showed small pieces of debris recovered by residents and tourists in the Turks and Caicos. Most of these items were modest in size, and many appeared to be chunks of tiles from Starship's heat shield. Unsurprisingly, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded Starship and ordered an investigation into the accident on the day after the launch. This decision came three days before the inauguration of President Donald Trump. Elon Musk's close relationship with Trump, coupled with the new administration's appetite for cutting regulations and reducing the size of government, led some industry watchers to question whether Musk's influence might change the FAA's stance on SpaceX. So far, the FAA hasn't budged on its requirement for an investigation, an agency spokesperson told Ars on Friday. After a preliminary assessment of flight data, SpaceX officials said a fire appeared to develop in the aft section of the ship before it broke apart and fell to Earth. \"The FAA has directed SpaceX to lead an investigation of the Starship Super Heavy Flight 7 mishap with FAA oversight,\" the spokesperson said. \"Based on the investigation findings for root cause and corrective actions, the FAA may require a company to modify its license.\" This is much the same language the FAA used two weeks ago, when it first ordered the investigation. Damage report The FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation is charged with ensuring commercial space launches and reentries don't endanger the public, and requires launch operators obtain liability insurance or demonstrate financial ability to cover any third-party property damages. For each Starship launch, the FAA requires SpaceX maintain liability insurance policies worth at least $500 million for such claims. It's rare for debris from US rockets to fall over land during a launch. This would typically only happen if a launch failed at certain parts of the flight. And there's no public record of any claims of third-party property damage in the era of commercial spaceflight. Under federal law, the US¬†government would pay for damages to a much higher amount if any claims exceeded a launch company's insurance policies. Here‚Äôs a piece of Starship 33 @SpaceX @elonmusk found in Turks and Caicos! üöÄüèùÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/HPZDCqA9MV ‚Äî @maximzavet (@MaximZavet) January 17, 2025 The good news is there were no injuries or reports of significant damage from the wreckage that fell over the Turks and Caicos. \"The FAA confirmed one report of minor damage to a vehicle located in South Caicos,\" an FAA spokesperson told Ars on Friday. \"To date, there are no other reports of damage.\" It's not clear if the vehicle owner in South Caicos will file a claim against SpaceX for the damage. It would the first time someone makes such a claim related to an accident with a commercial rocket overseen by the FAA. Last year, a Florida homeowner submitted a claim to NASA for damage to his house from a piece of debris that fell from the International Space Station. Nevertheless, the Turks and Caicos government said local officials met with representatives from SpaceX and the UK Air Accident Investigations Branch on January 25 to develop a recovery plan for debris that fell on the islands, which are a British Overseas Territory. A prickly relationship Musk often bristled at the FAA last year, especially after regulators proposed fines of more than $600,000 alleging that SpaceX violated terms of its launch licenses during two Falcon 9 missions. The alleged violations involved the relocation of a propellant farm at one of SpaceX's launch pads in Florida, and the use of a new launch control center without FAA approval. In a post on X, Musk said the FAA was conducting \"lawfare\" against his company. \"SpaceX will be filing suit against the FAA for regulatory overreach,\" Musk wrote. There was no such lawsuit, and the issue may now be moot. Sean Duffy, Trump's new secretary of transportation, vowed to review the FAA fines during his confirmation hearing in the Senate. It is rare for the FAA to fine launch companies, and the fines last year made up the largest civil penalty ever imposed by the FAA's commercial spaceflight division. SpaceX also criticized delays in licensing Starship test flights last year. The FAA cited environmental issues and concerns about the extent of the sonic boom from Starship's 23-story-tall Super Heavy booster returning to its launch pad in South Texas. SpaceX successfully caught the returning first stage booster at the launch pad for the first time in October, and repeated the feat after the January 16 test flight. What separates the FAA's ongoing oversight of Starship's recent launch failure from these previous regulatory squabbles is that debris fell over populated areas. This would appear to be directly in line with the FAA's responsibility for public safety. During last month's test flight, Starship did not deviate from its planned ground track, which took the rocket over the Gulf of Mexico, the waters between Florida and Cuba, and then the Atlantic Ocean. But the debris field extended beyond the standard airspace closure for the launch. After the accident, FAA air traffic controllers cleared additional airspace over the debris zone for more than an hour, rerouting, diverting, and delaying dozens of commercial aircraft. These actions followed pre-established protocols. However, it highlighted the small but non-zero risk of rocket debris falling to Earth after a launch failure. \"The potential for a bad day downrange just got real,\" Lori Garver, a former NASA deputy administrator, posted on X. Public safety is not sole mandate of the FAA's commercial space office. It is also chartered to \"encourage, facilitate, and promote commercial space launches and reentries by the private sector,\" according to an FAA website. There's a balance to strike. Lawmakers last year urged the FAA to speed up its launch approvals, primarily because Starship is central to strategic national objectives. NASA has contracts with SpaceX to develop a variant of Starship to land astronauts on the Moon, and Starship's unmatched ability to deliver more than 100 tons of cargo to low-Earth orbit is attractive to the Pentagon. While Musk criticized the FAA in 2024, SpaceX officials in 2023 took a different tone, calling for Congress to increase the budget for the FAA's Office of Commercial Spaceflight and for the regulator to double the space division's workforce. This change, SpaceX officials argued, would allow the FAA to more rapidly assess and approve a fast-growing number of commercial launch and reentry applications. In September, SpaceX released a statement accusing the former administrator of the FAA, Michael Whitaker, of making inaccurate statements about SpaceX to a congressional subcommittee. In a different post on X, Musk directly called for Whitaker's resignation. He needs to resign https://t.co/pG8htfTYHb ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 25, 2024 That's exactly what happened. Whitaker, who took over the FAA's top job in 2023 under the Biden administration, announced in December he would resign on Inauguration Day. Since the agency's establishment in 1958, three FAA administrators have similarly resigned when a new administration takes power, but the office has been largely immune from presidential politics in recent decades. Since 1993, FAA administrators have stayed in their post during all presidential transitions. There's no evidence Whitaker's resignation had any role in the mid-air collision of an American Eagle passenger jet and a US Army helicopter Wednesday night near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. But his departure from the FAA less than two years into a five-year term on January 20 left the agency without a leader. Trump named Chris Rocheleau as the FAA's acting administrator Thursday. Next flight, next month? SpaceX has not released an official schedule for the next Starship test flight or outlined its precise objectives. However, it will likely repeat many of the goals planned for the previous flight, which ended before SpaceX could accomplish some of its test goals. These missed objectives included the release of satellite mockups in space for the first demonstration of Starship's payload deployment mechanism, and a reentry over the Indian Ocean to test new, more durable heat shield materials. The January 16 test flight was the first launch up an upgraded, slightly taller Starship, known as Version 2 or Block 2. The next flight will use the same upgraded version. A SpaceX filing with the Federal Communications Commission suggests the next Starship flight could launch as soon as February 24. Sources told Ars that SpaceX teams believe a launch before the end of February is realistic. But SpaceX has more to do before Flight 8. These tasks include completing the FAA-mandated investigation and the installation of all 39 Raptor engines on the rocket. Then, SpaceX will likely test-fire the booster and ship before stacking the two elements together to complete assembly of the 404-foot-tall (123.1-meter) rocket. SpaceX is also awaiting a new FAA launch license, pending its completion of the investigation into what happened on Flight 7.

The next flight will use the same upgraded version.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA SpaceX \u003ca href=\"https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/els/reports/STA_Print.cfm?application_seq=140066\u0026amp;mode=current\"\u003efiling with the Federal Communications Commission\u003c/a\u003e suggests the next Starship flight could launch as soon as February 24. Sources told Ars that SpaceX teams believe a launch before the end of February is realistic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut SpaceX has more to do before Flight 8. These tasks include completing the FAA-mandated investigation and the installation of all 39 Raptor engines on the rocket. Then, SpaceX will likely test-fire the booster and ship before stacking the two elements together to complete assembly of the 404-foot-tall (123.1-meter) rocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpaceX is also awaiting a new FAA launch license, pending its completion of the investigation into what happened on Flight 7.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n          \n                  \u003c/div\u003e\n\n                  \n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n          \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/author/stephenclark/\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://arstechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/clarkstephenheadshot-md.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of Stephen Clark\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      Stephen Clark is a space reporter at Ars Technica, covering private space companies and the world‚Äôs space agencies.
