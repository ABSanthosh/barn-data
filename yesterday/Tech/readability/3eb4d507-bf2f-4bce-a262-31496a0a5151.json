  "text": "Alert is also a differentiator from the most famous Bluetooth tracker, Apple AirTags, as well as rival Chipolo trackers. Tile trackers support a similar SOS feature, but to use it, Tile owners have to subscribe to a membership (which includes other features, such as crash detection and location history for up to seven days), starting at $8 per month or $80/year. Tech companies have already been increasingly turning to subscriptions to keep the revenue flowing, but some expect subscription-free features and updates for consumer gadgets to become even rarer as companies manage new US tariffs. New and ongoing challenges in keeping emerging consumer gadgets secure, modern, and exciting while making money make Pebblebee’s small but thoughtful update all the more commendable. Of course, Pebblebee also benefits from this update as the new feature could make the Clip Universal more appealing to shoppers. Anything that could boost the value proposition of its trackers is strategic, since Pebblebee's trackers cost more than AirTags (starting at $35 versus $29 per tracker, respectively). Pebblebee trackers also lack ultra-wideband radio technology, which AirTags have, but have an advantage over AirTags in that they’re all rechargeable. A Pebblebee spokesperson told Ars Technica that the company doesn't currently have plans to add Alert to its other trackers and that it picked Clip for Alert because \"it's the best form factor\" for the feature.",
