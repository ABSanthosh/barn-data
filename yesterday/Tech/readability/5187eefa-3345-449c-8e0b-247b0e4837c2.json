  "text": "While VPNs are often used for privacy protection, they’re actually far more than that. With some of them, like NordVPN, you can also protect your devices against malware and keep the investment relatively low. Why is this important? Well, there are plenty of reasons. Malware infection could also infringe on your privacy or even make your device a milking machine for crypto miners. Additionally, if you’re in a surveillance-ridden country, a VPN will encrypt your traffic and make it unreadable. Luckily, you can protect both sides of your privacy with NordVPN. This guide will explore how and even let you in on a secret NordVPN Birthday deal, where you can get up to a year of this VPN for FREE. See At NordVPN Enjoy 360-degree Privacy \u0026 Security NordVPN offers powerful 256-bit encryption to keep your traffic safe. It also employs a Double VPN, which doubles the said encryption to keep snoopers and ISPs at bay. This VPN’s appeal lies in its no-log policy, which has received multiple third-party audits. This results in NordVPN retaining no sensitive information on its servers. With this in place, you can browse, stream, and torrent in privacy. If you choose NordVPN Plus, Complete, or Prime plan, you’ll get Threat Protection Pro. This is where malware blocking comes into play, spiced up by ad-blocking and tracker protection. It works similarly to an antivirus. You’ll enjoy real-time protection, where NordVPN will prevent malicious downloads and “kill” ads in real time. With this proposition, you’ll avoid third-party tracking and not have your device mine crypto for an unknown entity. NordVPN also includes browsing protection, helping you avoid phishing attacks and suspicious websites. If you add to that streaming optimization, thousands of P2P servers, and VPN obfuscation, you get an award-winning VPN. NordVPN Birthday Deal Conditions At the moment, NordVPN celebrates its 13 years of existence with an eye-watering sale. Namely, the provider has slashed the prices of its 24-month plans by 70% but the stars are Plus, Complete, and Prime plans. The Plus plan is likely the best value because it contains all of the said features plus NordPass, to help you manage and create secure passwords. The Plus package comes in at $4.39/mo for 24 months, with 6 free months. © NordVPN This means you’re paying for 24 and get 30 months of NordVPN. You’ll also love its Complete plan at $5.39/mo with 6 free months. It contains everything from Plus with NordLocker’s 1 TB of encrypted cloud storage. Lastly, there’s NordVPN’s Prime plan at $8.39/mo, which builds upon the other two by adding NordProtect. If you value privacy above everything, this plan is the ultimate solution, as it also gives you 12 free months. Check Out NordVPN Birthday Offers All of them are risk-free with a 30-day money-back guarantee, so there’s room for wiggle if you make up your mind. Just be quick because the Birthday sale ends soon.
