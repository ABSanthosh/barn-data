  "description": "Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune will have a new streaming home this fall. Sony Pictures Television has inked multi-year deals for the pair of iconic game shows to stream on Peacock, Hulu and Hulu on Disney+ in the US. The agreement includes both in-season syndicated episodes and library episodes. It's a next-day deal, so broadcast channels are still the first spot to see the newest content. However, this remains a very exciting development for Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune fans, since it's the first time currently syndicated seasons will be available on the major national streaming platforms. Both shows will begin this new streaming arrangement in September, when Jeopardy! will start its 42nd season in syndication. The quiz show has amassed a whopping 45 Emmy Awards and was also honored with a Peabody Award. Wheel of Fortune will be going into its 43rd season in syndication this fall.
