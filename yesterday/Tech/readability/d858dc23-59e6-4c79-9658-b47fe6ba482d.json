Promoted cards do not include input from individual authors. Remember: The best gifts for men should make the guy you're buying for feel seen. They should make him feel like you truly get him.No two guys are the same, and not every man spends their days dreaming of whiskey stones. (In fact, we'd guess that very few of them do.) Traditional male stereotypes are a thing of the past, y'all, and it's time we started embracing that fact when we're looking for gifts. Before you click “buy” on something that will definitely require a gift receipt, let us take the wheel and show you some gifts for him that are sure to make an impression on your lucky guy. And if you need more specific gift ideas, check out this gift guide for the father figure in your life, or this one if you’re shopping for your boyfriend. Whether he’s into kitchen accessories, fashion-forward athleisure, self-care products, or something more eccentric, we’re confident that he'll love the picks on this list. For Father's Day birthdays, holidays, and any random occasion, we've got you covered. A high-lumen flashlight Best for the safety chief You may have seen those TikTok videos of super-bright flashlights that turn night into day. And if you haven't, we bet the man you're shopping for has. This compact flashlight somehow packs 1,200 lumens of light, and you may want to remind him not to point it directly at anyone's face. SPONSORED NOW StreamSaver™ from Xfinity Best for the pop culture expert For the dude who can't miss a single moment of his favorite shows, add a NOW TV entertainment package to his Xfinity subscription. He'll be able to stream more than 125 live TV channels (including the History Channel, Food Network, Discovery, and Animal Planet, to name a few.) Included with this deal is a Peacock Premium subscription and the ability to simultaneously stream on up to three devices at once. A dad-approved battery caddy Best for going full dad-mode For dads, or guys who are slowly turning into their dads, this gift idea will give him ultimate DIY-cred. This battery storage caddy is named — we kid you not — the Battery Daddy, and it lets him play the hero every time a remote control or flashlight runs out of juice. (It even comes with a battery tester.) Pair this with a battery multi-pack for extra gifting points. A Nintendo Switch OLED Best for the on-the-go gamer If he's a gamer and doesn't have a Nintendo Switch yet, it's time to rectify that problem. And why not do it with the best iteration of the handheld console yet? It's got a new and improved OLED screen (it's bigger than ever, too), better speakers, more storage, and plenty more to go ga-ga over. A high-tech air purifier Best for the wellness nut This super sleek and quiet purification system for air and exposed surfaces eliminates pathogens, bacteria, germs, mold, and viruses, and is easy to install on a ceiling, wall, or floor, so he can breathe easy. Available in three different power options for different square footage areas, its compact size equals a low carbon footprint and low energy consumption. SPONSORED Smart Garage® Video Keypad from MyQ Best for the responsible one The humble garage door opener is getting an upgrade. This smart model from MyQ allows you to create unique PINs on the app for family members and guests, monitor activity via a security camera, and receive real-time alerts. For a limited time, you can also snag it on sale for $49.99. A handsome wine rack Best for the oenophile This unique wine rack holds up to six bottles of wine (larger sizes are available), and it's just the right size to keep on your countertops. From now on, he'll always have a bottle of wine close at hand, and he can show off his latest bottles whenever guests visit. SPONSORED Peloton Tread Best for the guy who's gotta move If he loves to run, but gets demotivated once the cold sets in, then the Peloton Tread is likely at the top of his list. This is way more than an indoor treadmill. An all-access membership lets him tune into live and on-demand classes (yoga, strength training, etc) plus he can also stream movies and TV shows to make those long runs a bit more bearable. For a limited time, get up to $800 off Peloton Tread packages. A laser-guided robot vacuum Best for clean freaks This robot vacuum may have an intimidating price tag, but we have good news: It's pretty much always on sale for at least $150 off. For the Type A guys in your life who absolutely hate the sight of pet hair or dust bunnies, this smart robot vacuum uses lasers to hunt down dirt. A Lego set for adults Best for brick builders There's a lot of crossover between gamers and Lego fans. This fierce little Piranha Plant kit from the Lego Super Mario collection will not only be fun to build, but will also give him a fun new piece of decor for his desk or bookshelf. A pair of Bowflex SelectTech 552 adjustable dumbbells Best for the guy with a home gym Not everyone has time to go to a gym, so the next best thing is making the gym right where you are. While pricey, the Bowflex SelectTech 552 adjustable dumbbells are the epitome of \"bang for your buck\" — in one pair of dumbbells, you'll basically get an entire dumbbell rack that you'd typically find in a commercial gym, so it's a real space-saver. Time to get big! A 'Hot Ones' hot sauce bundle Best for the 'Hot Ones' fan If you've ever heard him say, \"Damn, I wish that were me,\" while watching an episode of \"Hot Ones,\" now is your opportunity to make that dream come true. This bundle includes every sauce from the latest season, including Heatonist's ultra-spicey house version of the fan-favorite, \"Da Bomb.\" Interview questions and chicken wings not included. A Lodge enameled Dutch oven Best for the guy with too much cookware Are his pots and pans clattering to the floor every time he opens his kitchen cabinet? If so, he needs something a little more \"all-in-one\" so he can gain back some of that storage space. A Dutch oven is a versatile cookware essential that can last a lifetime if taken care of properly. This one from Lodge is extremely well-made, and doesn't cost nearly as much as its Le Creuset rival. A Polaroid Now+ Best for the photographer If he’s obsessed with documenting his life through pictures, he’ll certainly appreciate Polaroid’s latest (and most modern) instant camera to date. He can pair it with the Polaroid app via Bluetooth to get creative with Aperture, Tripod, Remote, Self-Timer, Light Painting, Double Exposure, Portrait, and Manual modes. It also comes with a bonus lens filter kit — throw in some spare film, and you'll be golden. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Best for the gamer If the majority of his monthly expenses involve video games, Xbox Game Pass is a must. Basically the Netflix of gaming, Xbox Game Pass has an extended library of titles, including both new releases and classics, to download at any time. It's also suspiciously cheap for the value, but we aren't complaining.  A VNYL subscription Best for the music nerd If his Spotify membership isn't doing it for him, treat him to a vinyl subscription service. VNYL will send brand new records to members each month based on their personal music tastes, making it a wonderful way to discover obscure artists and your new favorite track. (Just make sure he has a record player, first.) A HyperChiller Best for iced coffee enthusiasts Who doesn’t love a good iced coffee? The HyperChiller is a delightful (and dishwasher-safe) beverage chiller that turns piping hot coffee into refreshing iced coffee in about a minute, and without diluting it. It also works for whiskey, bottles of wine, and tea.  The Courant Catch:3 wireless charging tray Best for the messy man If his nightstand is looking totally out of sorts, the Courant Catch:3 should get him back on track (though we can't speak for the rest of his room). It isn't just a catch-all tray for jewelry, keys, and other items of the like — it's also a wireless charging mat that works on any nightstand. The Byrd Hairdo Products Flock Favorites kit Best for guys who love their hair If his hair routine is an important part of his daily grooming ritual, Byrd makes a fantastic haircare set that covers the essentials. It comes with a canister of matte pomade, a texturizing salt spray, a pocket comb, and an air freshener as a fun little extra something.  The Bearaby Cotton Napper weighted blanket Best for the anxious guy Weighted blankets are all the rage right now, but what sets Bearaby's Napper apart is that it's fully hand-knit, which should help minimize bead leakage. It's also machine washable. Birkenstock Boston Clog Best for the guy who hates shoelaces Sometimes laces are nothing more than a chore. If he's most concerned with comfort, the Birkenstock Boston Clogs come with a form-fitting footbed that's excellent for extended wear. Plus, they're really popular on TikTok, so extra cool points for that. A Mejuri mini hoop earring Best for the guy who likes jewelry If he appreciates a little understated bling in his daily getup, these mini hoop earrings from Mejuri should complement his personal style nicely. They come in both white and yellow gold; we recommend picking up one of each for when he wants to switch things up. (They're true 14-karat gold, too, meaning they won't oxidize or discolor — a great value for $30.)   A pair of Carhartt double-front washed duck work pants Best for the guy who's on-trend Carhartt work pants have officially left the \"dads only\" category. These have a comfortable, loose fit that sits high on the waist, plenty of pockets, and cool knee-pad detailing on the front. Time to hop on the bandwagon.  The Brooklinen Super-Plush Robe Best for the homebody Every guy needs a good robe, by which we mean an investment that will last, not fall apart in the wash. Brooklinen's Super-Plush Robe will ensure that his homebody self is feeling comfortable and luxurious at all times. Plus, it's seriously soft. A Dodow sleep aid Best for the restless guy Not everyone sleeps like a baby. Some of us need a little extra help to catch some of those much-needed Zs. If you know a guy who has trouble getting to sleep at night, check out the Dodow sleep aid device: a metronome system designed to help you fall asleep naturally. A Menlo Club subscription Best for the fashion newbie If the man in your life has zero fashion sense, then a monthly subscription to Menlo Club makes a great gift. For $60 a month, subscribers will receive two or three curated items in the mail to keep, ranging from casual clothes like T-shirts and jeans to activewear like running shorts and tank tops. A Loot Crate subscription Best for geeky guys If the man in your life is a comic book nerd, a Loot Crate membership is a must-have. Once a month, the pop culture subscription service will send a mystery box full of products, toys, T-shirts, socks, and more right to his doorstep. The best part: Most of the items sent are exclusives or limited editions. A pour-over coffee maker Best for coffee lovers The Chemex Classic Series Pour-Over Glass Coffeemaker looks gorgeous on a countertop and makes for a lovely gift for even the snobbiest of coffee snobs. This option makes eight cups and can be refrigerated and reheated without the coffee getting gross. The Cubii under-desk elliptical Best for the multitasker If you've ever heard him complain that he simply doesn't have enough time to go to the gym, give him this creative way to multitask. The Cubii Under Desk Elliptical will allow him to work out while he's working — who needs an Equinox membership, anyway? A Hydro Flask Best for the hydrated dude One of the most popular insulated water bottles on the market, a Hydro Flask is one of the best ways to ensure that he stays hydrated in style. It's capable of keeping hot drinks hot for up to 12 hours, and cold drinks cold for an entire day. Plus, a wide opening and a straw lid allow for easy beverage access. Did we mention it's all dishwasher-safe? A Braun electric shaver Best for men who need a close shave If you know someone who wants to ditch their razor blades and shaving cream in favor of electric razors, the Braun Electric Shaver Series 9 should be at the top of your list. The Series 9 is a superb electric shaver that is also gentle on the face — two very important qualities. It's expensive, yes, but oh-so worth it. An Ember mug Best for the tea sipper Here's the tea: The Ember mug is a truly next-level product for any and all hot-beverage-drinking guys. Through Ember's app, he'll have the ability to select his preferred temperature, to which the mug will adjust on command. Just one charge will give the mug a whole hour of juice, and he can even save temperature presets for different types of drinks.  Amazon's favorite sous vide Best for the aspiring chef We're past the age of grilled steaks — it's all about sous vide nowadays. While it takes longer and is a more involved process, the result is dangerously delicious, which is why it's a great gift for the foodie fellas. This WiFi-enabled sous vide tool from Amazon best-seller Anova is one of the sleekest, most compact options out there, and it makes the process simple for newbies. The Awair Element Best for the health-conscious Maintaining a safe and healthy home starts with good air quality. Enter: the Awair Element, a modern-looking monitoring device that measures and tracks fine dust particles and any chemicals present in the air. He'll be able to access real-time data and personalized recommendations on its companion app, including insights on how his actions (like the cleaning supplies he uses) are impacting the health of his space.

It includes a daily facial cleanser, an energizing exfoliator, a double-duty moisturizer, and an intense therapy lip balm. Whether he needs a new routine or is already skincare-obsessed, this set is a great option. A 23andMe DNA test kit Best for the curious guy 23andMe is a super popular gift every year, in part due to its convenience. Once he gets the kit, all he'll need to do is send in a small sample of saliva to 23andMe. In roughly three to four weeks, he'll get a comprehensive report of his ancestry, including precise geographic detail and in-depth historical insights, as well as a breakdown of his defining genetic traits. A Kindle Paperwhite Best for the bookworm This thin, lightweight, and long-lasting e-reader has a glare-free display, which helps its screen look like real paper even in direct sunlight. It's waterproof, too, meaning he'll be able to take it out by the pool (or even on a beach trip), and an adjustable warm light keeps it easy on his eyes. Plus, it comes with a free four-month trial of Kindle Unlimited — in case he's already plowed through his library and needs something new to read. Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses Best for the classic man These sunglasses are a timeless classic.

A Theragun Mini Best for fitness fanatics After long runs or intense workouts, pretty much everyone wishes they could get a massage. The compact, quiet Theragun Mini is basically the next best thing.
