Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication. Credit: Product image courtesy of Amazon. Anker has been on a roll slashing prices off their portable projectors, with the powerful Mars 3 Air reaching its lowest price earlier this month, the mid-size Nebula Capsule 3 still at its lowest price, and now their smallest portable projector, the Nebula Capsule Air down to $269.99 (originally $399.99) after a $100 discount and a 10% on-page coupon on Amazon. This is the lowest price this portable projector has been, according to price-tracking tools. Portable projectors, obviously, must work independently of an outlet and be easy to cart around. The Nebula Capsule Air can do both, measuring just 5.5 by 2.7 by 2.7 inches (HWD)—that's slightly bigger than a regular soda can. The battery isn't great, but considering the size, two hours is fine (you'll be able to watch most movies in one shot). Where this projector falls short is on the brightness, reaching a mere 150 ANSI lumens. That means you need to get your space dark if you want to see a good image. If you have ambient light outdoors and you're hoping to use this projector, it might be washed out. The native resolution is also just 720p, although it supports 1080p input in HDR.PCMag gave this projector an \"excellent\" rating on their review, pointing out how the HDR makes shadows look much better, gave it props for the Google TV OS (which is my favorite since it lets you seamlessly cast your phone to the projector), and praising the twist-on stand that allows you to position the image easily on your screen or wall.Portable projectors need good keystone, since by their very nature, they will be moved a lot and the image will be constantly out of focus. The Nebula Capsule Air has an excellent keystone, with autofocus and automatic horizontal and vertical adjustments.If you're looking for the smallest reliable projector at a great price, the Nebula Capsule Air projector is a great choice.
