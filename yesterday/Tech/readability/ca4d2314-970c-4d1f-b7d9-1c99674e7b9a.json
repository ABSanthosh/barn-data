They adapt to dynamic tasks in real-time, enabling an unprecedented level of autonomy,” said Ralf Gulde, CEO and co-founder of Sereact (short for “sense, reason, act”).

They adapt to dynamic tasks in real-time, enabling an unprecedented level of autonomy,” said Ralf Gulde, CEO and co-founder of Sereact (short for “sense, reason, act”). Early Spotify and Klarna-backer Creandum led the Series A round. Existing investors Point Nine and Air Street Capital also chipped in as did several prominent angel investors. These include former Formula 1 World Champion Nico Rosberg, ex-DeepMind product lead Mehdi Ghissassi, and past Skype exec Ott Kaukver. Typically, robots — like those Roomba vacuum cleaners — are hard-coded. This means they follow exact instructions that enable them to repeat specific tasks.  Sereact’s eembodied AI, however, acts like a robot’s brain, allowing them to analyse and even learn new jobs on the go. This is thanks to a machine learning technique called zero-shot visual reasoning, which allows AI to understand and interpret images without prior specific training on those types of images.  The model, dubbed PickGPT, makes robots smarter. It also means humans don’t have to pre-program them for each task, saving time for the companies that use them.  “The opportunities here are endless and it’s great to see this kind of innovation coming from Europe,” said Johan Brenner, general partner at Creandum. Sereact’s approach is similar to that of UK startup Wayve, which raised $1bn in Europe’s largest-ever AI funding round last year. However, while Wayve’s tech targets autonomous vehicles, Sereact focuses on logistics and warehouse robots that do things like pick and pack, sort goods, and run quality control checks. Firms like BMW, Daimler Truck, Bol and Active Ants have already adopted Sereact’s software at their factories. However, the startup is now looking to venture beyond the warehouse.  Sereact said it will use the fresh funding to develop new “robot hardware platforms,” such as mobile robots and humanoids. The company also plans to expand its US presence.  “We’re on an exciting journey to become the leading platform for robotics applications that forever change the daily lives of people and businesses,” said Gulde.  Published January 20, 2025 - 10:57 am UTC Back to top",
