The fintech company has filed for a broker-dealer licence with US regulators, completing the first phase of its two-step expansion strategy. The licence will allow Bunq to offer American users investment options — stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds — alongside cash management tools. These will include features like automatic transfers and Mastercard-backed debit cards. However, Bunq isn’t diving into the deep end just yet. This phased approach lets the company gather real-world data and user feedback before it applies for a full US banking licence later this year, Bunq said. A US banking licence would let Bunq operate like a fully regulated American bank. It would be able to offer checking and savings accounts, hold deposits directly, and issue credit. Ali Niknam, Bunq’s founder and CEO — who will share his company’s story at TNW Conference on June 20 — said the move aligns with his mission to serve a growing base of “location-independent” users: digital nomads, expats, remote workers, and global entrepreneurs.  Like most neobanks, Bunq doesn’t have physical branches. Instead, its customers do their banking fully online. “Our users live an international lifestyle, and they need a bank that’s global too,” said Niknam. “Today’s step brings us closer to making that vision a reality.”  Amsterdam-based Bunq has already seen rapid growth in Europe, where it now counts 17 million users. The company also reported €85.3mn in profit for 2024 — marking its second consecutive year of profitability and a 65% jump from the previous year.  Bunq said it plans to reinvest those profits into its international expansion, with the US a key target. At TNW Conference, Ali Niknam will explain how he built a bank that moves at startup speed. The event takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam — and tickets are now now on sale.
