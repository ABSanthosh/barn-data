Diners ordering a Happy Meal these days will find a Squishmallow theme meal instead. But there's more viral buzz about another McDonald's product online. People are eagerly awaiting the return of Snack Wraps, a chicken-tortilla entree that's been missing from US locations of the Golden Arches since 2020.Read more: Review: McDonald's Minecraft Meals Feature The Hottest Nugget Sauce EverOn April 15, McDonald's tweeted \"snack wraps 0x.14.2025,\" hinting the wraps would return on the 14th of an upcoming month. This leaves fans having to check their McDonald's mobile app or local restaurant menus on the 14th of every month, hoping the wraps will make an appearance. The wraps didn't appear in restaurants on May 14, so now fans must check again in June, and again in July if the June date does not pan out. At least one Reddit users seems to think the McDonald's Snack Wraps could return on July 14. One user wrote, \"It's July, I work for McDonald's, they revealed the date on the employee app.\"But another person posted, \"It's not July. I work at McDonald's corporate and can confirm.\"Neither of those posts can be confirmed.June 14 is a Saturday, while July 14 is a Monday. Some suggest that McDonald's would be more likely to launch a new product on a Monday than on a weekend, so if that's true, July 14 could be the day.A representative for McDonald's did not immediately respond to a request for comment.snack wraps 0x.14.2025— McDonald's (@McDonalds) April 15, 2025 Snack Wrap feverSnack Wraps first came out in 2006, and were meant to be a chicken item that would appeal to drive-thru customers. There are different versions, but the basic one includes white-meat chicken strips known as McCrispy Strips wrapped in a flour tortilla with cheese and lettuce with either ranch, honey mustard or salsa. McCrispy Strips are a reworked version of a chicken item formerly known as Chicken Selects.Zach Ciampa, who regularly covers new food releases under the social-media handle Snach With Zach, said there's been an intense fanbase out there for the wraps. \"Regarding McDonald's Snack Wrap, it's by far the most requested item I've ever seen my audience ask or demand to come back,\" he told CNET. \"Not just the most requested in recent memory, but the most requested of all time. And that's not limited to McDonald's.\" Ciampa said the only similar fast-food items that come close to the same level of interest are Dairy Queen's S'mores Blizzard and Taco Bell's Caramel Apple Empanada, both of which also made recent returns.\"I've been covering food releases for years, and in that time, I've seen countless comments to the tune of 'We don't want this. We want the Snack Wrap,' and, 'Can you tell us when the Snack Wrap is coming back?'\" he said. \"A couple years ago, the chances of its return were pretty bleak. However, things escalated pretty quickly in late 2023 when McDonald's did indeed announce that the Snack Wrap would return in a new form. Since then, details have slowly but surely trickled out, and the hype has steadily grown.\"While Snack Wraps left McDonald's locations in the US back in 2020, they remained available at Canadian and UK restaurants. The current online McDonald's Canada menu includes several tortilla-wrapped items, including ones with crispy chicken, grilled chicken, buffalo chicken and chicken with a sweet chili sauce.",
