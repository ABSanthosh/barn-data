  "text": "Poland is set to power up its first full-stack quantum computer this year, following a deal with Helsinki-based startup IQM. IQM, Europe’s best-funded quantum hardware company, will install the machine at the Wrocław University of Science and Technology (WUST) in Poland.  Named “Spark,” the device is a superconducting quantum computer. This means that it uses superconducting circuits to create and manipulate quantum bits or “qubits” on quantum processors. Machines like Spark can only function at temperatures near absolute zero, making them some of the coldest places in the known universe.  “This is the first quantum computer in our country and Eastern Europe using low-temperature superconducting qubit technology,” said Professor Wojciech Bożejko, head of WUST’s faculty of ICT.  Researchers at WUST will use Spark for computer science research. “The system will offer students in Poland direct access to the actual quantum computer for practical programming in quantum computing,” said Bożejko. “Our goal is to conduct research and educate IT specialists.” Getting scientists quantum-ready Spark only has 5-qubits — the lower end of the scale — and doesn’t have the computing power to outperform classical computers. However, it still provides an important testbed to familiarise researchers with quantum mechanics and prepare them for quantum utility. That’s the point at which quantum computers provide practical advantages over classical computers in solving specific real-world problems. IQM — whose CEO is speaking at TNW Conference on June 19 — is targeting quantum utility as early as next year, through some much larger machines with many more qubits than Spark. It’s also developed an entire business based around getting scientists and corporations ready for quantum utility right now. Founded in 2018, IQM has raised $210mn to date, making it Europe’s second best-funded quantum computing company after Quantinuum. According to Bloomberg, the startup is also in talks to raise over $200mn in fresh capital, which would bring its total funding to over $400mn. Located in Finland’s thriving quantum startup ecosystem, IQM has built over 30 full-stack quantum computers to date at its facility in Espoo, west of the capital, Helsinki. This site also houses Europe’s only private quantum chip factory.   If you want to catch the talk from IQM CEO and co-founder Jan Goetz at TNW Conference — or anything else on the packed agenda — we have a special offer for TNW readers.
