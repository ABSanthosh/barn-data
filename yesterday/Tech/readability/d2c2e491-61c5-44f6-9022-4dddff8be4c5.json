The Super Bowl LIX live stream will be available on February 9th on Tubi. Tubi will broadcast Eagles vs Chiefs for free, with no cable TV subscription required. Moreover, you’ll be able to stream the game in HD with English commentary for an immersive and exciting experience. Sounds good? We’ll explain everything. Read on. How to Watch Super Bowl LIX Abroad on Tubi Tubi acquired the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl LIX. We think this is great news because Tubi is a free streaming platform. To remind you, other platforms, like Fubo TV and YouTube TV also broadcast the event. However, they come with a hefty price tag of $84.99/mo and $82.99/mo respectively. Tubi, on the other hand, charges you nothing but as an American, you know it’ll work exclusively in the US. This, at first, means you can’t watch the Super Bowl LIX outside the US because of the well-known geo-restriction error. To access Tubi and stream the Super Bowl LIX abroad for free, you need to pretend you’re in the US. As reported by people online, this is easily achieved with a VPN. Most notably, NordVPN which we recently tested with great results. Watch Eagles vs Chiefs live with NordVPN NordVPN has ~2,000 US servers, making it a popular VPN for Americans. Those abroad can use NordVPN to acquire a US IP address and, in turn, make Tubi accessible anywhere. This is necessary because Tubi blocks access to people whose IP address is outside the US borders. Logically, only a US IP can fix the problem. As mentioned, the solution is free because of NordVPN’s 30-day money-back guarantee. In recent instances, people have used NordVPN to watch the Super Bowl live outside the US and canceled the VPN subscription after the match, getting a full refund. This is how to watch Eagles vs Chiefs abroad, anywhere, for free. Is Watching Tubi Outside the US Legal? You can bet it is! Americans abroad or anyone who wants to live-stream the Super Bowl LIX for free can use Tubi with NordVPN. Tubi requires an account to work but an account is free and takes mere seconds or minutes to create if you’re indecisive about your password. No one’s going to bat an eye whether or not you’re using a VPN. Besides, Americans overseas have been using NordVPN for years at this point, not only for watching the Super Bowl live but also for free streaming of NFL games. Besides, we’re sure you don’t want to miss out on the spectacle—a fusion of top-tier American football and Kendrick Lamar pouring his soul into the world-renowned Halftime Show. What a phenomenal combo! Where Else Can I Watch the Super Bowl LIX? As an American overseas, you don’t have ample options. The Super Bowl’s popularity peaks in North America, where it’ll mostly be broadcast on paid platforms. YouTube TV is a popular one but its juicy price tag deters most users. In the same fashion, you can opt for Fubo TV whose plans start at $84.99/mo. Both platforms work exclusively in the USA, so you’ll still need a VPN. As long as Tubi broadcasts Eagles vs Chiefs live for free, paid options make virtually no sense. The same goes for out-of-market NFL matches which you can broadcast anywhere using NordVPN, like other users. The Chiefs and Eagles have a 5-5 score so far, making it incredibly exciting to see which team will prevail. Luckily, with the simple trick explained above, you can stream Super Bowl LIX for free abroad without missing a single heart-pounding moment. Try NordVPN risk-free now Daily Newsletter",
