  "text": "Soundcore by Anker Sport X10: The Soundcore Sport X10 have an interesting design with rotating swiveling ear hooks that flip up when you're using them and flip down when you want to set them in their charging case, which has a smaller footprint than a lot of buds with ear hooks. As long as you get a tight seal, they sound good, with powerful, punchy bass and good detail. They also have active noise canceling, which is effective though not as good as Sony's or Bose's noise canceling. They're also fully waterproof with an IP rating of IPX7, which means they can be fully submerged in up to 3 feet of water for 30 minutes. Battery life is rated at up to eight hours with an additional three charges in the charging case.Sennheiser Sport True Wireless: The Sport True Wireless bluetooth earbuds (around $100) are essentially Sennheiser's CX True Wireless earbuds with sport fins -- for a more secure fit -- and better durability. They have an IP54 rating that makes them splash-proof and dust-resistant. The CX True Wireless, rated IPX4, don't offer dust resistance.Skullcandy Push Active : With their ear-hook design, they're essentially a more affordable version of the Beats Powerbeats Pro and they actually fit my ears slightly better than the Powerbeats Pro -- I'm not usually a fan of ear-hook style buds, but these are one of the better models. They also cost a lot less than the Beats.Cleer Audio Arc 2 Sport: Cleer's original Arc earbuds were solid sport earbuds that featured decent sound for open-style buds that sit on top of your ears and fire sound into them. The 2023 model (around $170) steps up the sound quality and offers additional refinements and feature upgrades, including a new \"enhanced\" charging case with UV sterilization and multipoint Bluetooth connectivity (Bluetooth 5.3), all of which makes for a significantly improved product.Beats Powerbeats Pro: While the Powerbeats Pro remain popular workout earbuds, they've been around for several years, so it's best to buy them at significant discount. JBL Live Pro 2: Over the years, JBL headphones have put out some decent true-wireless bluetooth earbuds, but nothing that really got me too excited. That's finally changed with the arrival of the Samsung-owned brand's new Live Pro 2 and Live Free 2 buds. Both sets of buds -- the Live Pro 2 have stems while the Live Free 2 have a pill-shaped design -- offer a comfortable fit along with strong noise canceling, very good sound quality and voice-calling performance, plus a robust set of features, including multipoint Bluetooth pairing, an IP rating of IPX5 (splash-proof) and wireless charging.Sony LinkBuds: The LinkBuds are, in a sense, Sony's answer to Apple's standard AirPods. While they don't sound as good as Sony's flagship WF-1000XM4 or the LinkBuds S noise-isolating bluetooth earbuds, they offer a discreet, innovative design and a more secure fit than the AirPods, as well as decent sound and very good voice-calling performance. Like the third-gen AirPods, their open design allows you to hear the outside world -- that's what the ring is all about. Read our Sony LinkBuds review.",
