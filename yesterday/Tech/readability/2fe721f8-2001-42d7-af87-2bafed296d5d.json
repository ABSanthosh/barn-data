  "text": "Samsung has paused the global rollout of its AI-driven One UI interface after a bug prevented some customers from unlocking their phones. The pause, flagged earlier by frequent Samsung leaker Ice Universe, appears to have affected Samsung Galaxy S24 models receiving the update in South Korea. People who upgraded to One UI 7 (aka Android 15) reported repeated issues unlocking their phones.The company has since pulled the update across all Galaxy models and regions, likely as a precautionary measure. Samsung told CNET that the software's \"new timing and availability will be shared shortly.\"\"The One UI 7 rollout schedule is being updated to ensure the best possible experience,\" Samsung added.Samsung began rolling out the One UI 7 update to Galaxy phones and tablets on April 7, starting with the Galaxy S24 series, Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6. Other devices were expected to follow soon.One UI 7 introduces a redesigned interface built around AI, offering people more personalization and control. The software uses artificial intelligence to help edit videos, write messages and suggest places to go for dinner.The move comes as tech companies race to embed more AI features into mobile devices, turning them into smarter personal assistants that can help complete everyday tasks.Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at market research firm Creative Insights, noted that most consumers are still only experimenting with AI and not buying devices based on its promise.\"While I am sure Samsung could have done without the bug, I doubt this will have a long-term impact on Galaxy AI uptake or consumers' interest in Samsung,\" she told CNET. \"Better pull the update than disjoint customers with an experience that is not great.\"",
