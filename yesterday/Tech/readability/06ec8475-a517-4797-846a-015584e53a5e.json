  "text": "It's been years since T-Mobile customers filed for a part of the wireless carrier's 2022 class-action settlement. But this month, those who qualify should start receiving their payouts.On April 8, a representative for the settlement did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether any payments have been issued.The settlement is the result of a class-action lawsuit filed against T-Mobile after a 2021 cyberattack exposed the personal data -- names, addresses and Social Security numbers -- of 76 million US customers. In 2022, T-Mobile agreed to a $350 million settlement to resolve claims that its negligence led to the data breach. It remains the second-largest data breach settlement in US history, following Equifax's $700 million settlement in 2019.How much will you get?If your data was exposed but you haven't already filed, it's too late to get in on the settlement. It's all over except for the distribution of the checks. T-Mobile agreed to pay $350 million into a settlement fund that will be used to make cash payments for out-of-pocket losses and lost time, make cash payments, provide identity-defense services, provide restoration services, make payments to notify class members and administer the settlement, pay the class representatives who brought the suit, and pay attorney fees and costs.According to The Hill, payments might be smaller than $25 for some, as priority will go to those who can prove they suffered out-of-pocket losses. Those who lived in California at the time of the data breach are eligible for $100. And those who spent money at the time to recover or avoid identity theft or fraud -- like freezing their credit, spending money on credit monitoring services, incurring losses or were told to document their losses -- are eligible for up to $25,000, according to The Hill.Those who made a valid claim for identity-defense services will be sent information on how to activate those services. Monetary payments will be made in the manner each customer selected at the time they filed, which could mean a paper check will be mailed, or a digital deposit will be made. You can read the full documents for the lawsuit online.",
