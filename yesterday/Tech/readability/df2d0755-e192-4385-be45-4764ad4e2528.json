  "text": "Some of us here at io9 play video games, and we’re more than intrigued by Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. While Sandfall Interactive’s Atlus–inspired RPG isn’t out until April, it’s already being eyed for a live-action movie. Per Variety, Sandfall is teaming with production company Story Kitchen to bring its debut game to the silver screen. The dark fantasy game focuses on a group of humans who set out to defeat the Paintress, a godlike figure who paints a number on her monolith, after which everyone that age vanishes. Players take on the role of the titular Expedition 33, whose members—voiced by the likes of Charlie Cox, Final Fantasy’s Ben Starr, and Baldur’s Gate 3’s Jennifer English, among others—are tasked with stopping the Paintress before humanity’s wiped out. Sandfall CEO and creative director Guillaume Broche said the movie “allows us to expand the universe of Clair Obscur beyond gaming. [Story Kitchen’s] expertise in storytelling and passion for our vision make them the perfect team to translate our game into a captivating film.” Over the past few years, Story Kitchen has helped get adaptations for Tomb Raider and Sonic off the ground, and its current slate also includes adapting games like Just Cause and Sifu—and since game adaptations are so hot right now, Expedition 33 might have a good chance of coming to fruition. Founders Dmitri M. Johnson and Mike Goldberg commended the game’s “compelling narrative and complex characters, [which] provide a solid foundation for a cinematic experience that will resonate with both gamers and moviegoers alike.” As the search is on for talent behind and in front of the camera for the hopeful adaptation, Sandfall is releasing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 for PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S on April 24.
