This legacy system not only complicated the user experience, but also presented significant costs and security risks, prompting the university to seek a unified and robust solution.Wake Forest University recently consolidated the school’s security platform with Google Workspace for Education Plus and saw major improvements:Protecting student records via Context-Aware Access and Data Loss Prevention (DLP), and an Investigation Tool for admins to remove malicious add-ons and revoke access to data that’s accidentally been shared.A significant drop in compromised accounts thanks to Google’s single sign-on and two-step verification.Time savings and substantial cost savings, estimated at around $1 million over a three-year period.Watch the video below to learn more.",
