  "description": "Fortune remembers that in 2011 Steve Jobs had told author Walter Isaacson that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates would \"be a broader guy if he had dropped acid once or gone off to an ashram when he was younger.\" But The Indendepent notes that in his new memoir Gates does write about two acid trip experiences. (Gates mis-timed his first experiment with LSD, ending up still tripping during a previously-scheduled appointment for dental surgery...) \"Later in the book, Gates recounts another experience with LSD with future Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and some friends... Gates says in the book that it was the fear of damaging his memory that finally persuaded him never to take the drug again.\" He added: \"I smoked pot in high school, but not because it did anything interesting. I thought maybe I would look cool and some girl would think that was interesting. It didn't succeed, so I gave it up.\" Gates went on to say that former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who didn't know about his past drug use, teased him on the subject. \"Steve Jobs once said that he wished I'd take acid because then maybe I would have had more taste in my design of my products,\" recalled Gates. \"My response to that was to say, 'Look, I got the wrong batch.' I got the coding batch, and this guy got the marketing-design batch, so good for him! Because his talents and mine, other than being kind of an energetic leader, and pushing the limits, they didn't overlap much. He wouldn't know what a line of code meant, and his ability to think about design and marketing and things like that... I envy those skills. I'm not in his league.\" Gates added that he was a fan of Michael Pollan's book about psychedelic drugs, How To Change Your Mind, and is intrigued by the idea that they may have therapeutic uses. \"The idea that some of these drugs that affect your mind might help with depression or OCD, I think that's fascinating,\" said Gates. \"Of course, we have to be careful, and that's very different than recreational usage.\" Touring the country, 69-year-old Gates shared more glimpses of his life story: The Harvard Gazette notes that the university didn't offer computer science degrees when Gates attended in 1973. But since Gates already had years of code-writing experience, he \"initially rebuffed any suggestion of taking computer-related coursework... 'It's too easy,' he remembered telling friends.\" \"The naiveté I had that free computing would just be this unadulterated good thing wasn't totally correct even before AI,\" Gates told an audience at the Harvard Book Store. \"And now with AI, I can see that we could shape this in the wrong way.\" Gates \"expressed regret about how he treated another boyhood friend, Paul Allen, the other cofounder of Microsoft, who died in 2018,\" reports the Boston Globe. \"Gates at first took 60 percent ownership of the new software company and then pressured his friend for another 4 percent. 'I feel bad about it in retrospect,' he said. 'That was always a little complicated, and I wish I hadn't pushed....'\" Business Insider adds that according to his memoir, Gates \"eventually gave his additional 4% stake to [Steve] Ballmer to convince him to quit business school for Microsoft. 'He joined in 1980 and became the 24-hour-a-day partner I needed,' Gates wrote.\" Benzinga writes that Gates has now \"donated $100 billion to charitable causes... Had Gates retained the $100 billion he has donated, his total wealth would be around $264 billion, placing him second on the global wealth rankings behind Elon Musk and ahead of Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg.\" Gates told the Associated Press \"I am stunned that Intel basically lost its way,\" saying Intel is now \"kind of behind\" on both chip design and fabrication. \"They missed the AI chip revolution, and with their fabrication capabilities, they don't even use standards that people like Nvidia and Qualcomm find easy... I hope Intel recovers, but it looks pretty tough for them at this stage.\" Gates also told the Associated Press that fighting a three-year antitrust case had \"distracted\" Microsoft. \"The area that Google did well in that would not have happened had I not been distracted is Android, where it was a natural thing for me. I was trying, although what I didn't do well enough is provide the operating system for the phone. That was ours for the taking.\" The Dallas News reports that in an on-stage interview in Texas, Mark Cuban closed by asking Gates one question. \"Is the American Dream alive?\" Gates answered: \"It was for me.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
