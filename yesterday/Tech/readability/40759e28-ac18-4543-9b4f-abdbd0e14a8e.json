(Full disclosure: CNET is owned by Ziff Davis, the same parent company as Mashable.) In the memo, T-Mobile said this week it would begin raising prices for some subscribers. John Freier, president of T-Mobile’s consumer group, noted that the price hikes were due to “rising costs over the past several years.Subscribers who are getting hit with the price increase started receiving notifications this week that their prices were going up, as stated in the memo. Reddit user anonymousdoe5147 posted an apparent screenshot of the text message. “For the first time in nearly a decade, we’re making an update to the price of some of our older monthly service plans,” T-Mobile’s text reportedly read. “Starting on 4/2/2025, your phone plan will increase by $5 per line per month. You’ll keep all the benefits you currently enjoy, and your rate plan type and bill due date will remain the same.” Mashable Light Speed The price hikes are the final piece of a series of  “price adjustments” that T-Mobile began last year. At the time, the carrier increased rates by either $2 or $5 per month, depending on the plan. At the time, the increases affected customers on T-Mobile’s Simple Choice Plan (released 2013), T-Mobile One Plan (released 2016), and T-Mobile’s Magenta and Magenta Max plans (released 2019 and 2021, respectively). Some T-Mobile business customers were also affected.People on T-Mobile’s current Go5G, Go5G Plus, and Go5G Next plans, along with those with T-Mobile’s Price Lock guarantee, are unaffected.T-Mobile justified the price increase by stating that “even with these small updates, on average, T-Mobile customers pay less.”Which T-Mobile plans are affected?T-Mobile hasn’t stated which plans are affected, so the overall impact remains a mystery. Based on complaints on Reddit, it seems Magenta MAX and T-Mobile ONE plans were primarily affected.Customers were apparently directed through text to an FAQ on T-Mobile’s website. The company doesn’t list which plans are affected there either, but it does note that the carrier’s Un-contract Promise is still in effect. Thus, anyone who’s very unhappy about the rate increases has 60 days to notify T-Mobile that they’re leaving, and T-Mobile says it will pay the final month of recurring charges. Topics 5G",
