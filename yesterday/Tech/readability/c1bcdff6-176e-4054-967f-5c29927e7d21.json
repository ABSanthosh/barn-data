A career highlight has been flying with my father, who is a Captain on the A350 with BA.I joined British Airways through their cadet scheme in 2014, which included an Integrated ATPL course that I completed at FTEJerez in Andalucia, Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸. My flying journey began in Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦, where I obtained my Glider Pilot License, Instructor Rating, and my PPL through Canadian Air Cadet scholarships.StatisticsI log all of my flights digitally using LogTen Pro, which lets me query them using SQL and present them in infographic format. My favourite is the GitHub-style flying history.",
