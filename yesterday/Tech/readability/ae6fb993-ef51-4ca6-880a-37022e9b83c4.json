  "description": "The innovative director David Lynch, who left indelible marks on film and television, passed away in January of this year. Now, Julien's Auctions is hosting the sale of The David Lynch Collection. More than 450 of the late director's possessions will be auctioned off online and at the company's auction house in Gardena, CA. For devotees of Lynch's work and worldview, just the experience of browsing the collection is pretty fascinating. The auction showcases plenty of items closely related to his career in film, such as a personalized director's chair, multiple cameras, lighting kits and memorabilia from his many iconic works. Other pieces more broadly reflect his passion for creativity, like audio equipment, musical instruments, painting supplies and a whole lot of literature and vinyl records. The collection also has furniture, like the couch from his 1997 classic Lost Highway, kitchen wares and many personal items from his life. You can even bid on his LaserDisc player and disc collection.
