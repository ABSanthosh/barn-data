  "text": "It’s not every day that an actor in a successful live action anime project gets to sit down and interview its creator in their native tongue, but Netflix’s One Piece star Iñaki Godoy did just that ahead of the show’s second season. In a recent video from Netflix’s Still Watching YouTube Channel, Monkey D. Luffy actor Godoy sat down with Eiichiro Oda on the set of One Piece’s Cape Town location in South Africa to discuss what lies ahead on the Grand Line in season two, and how Luffy became a beloved character. “I got to see some actual filming, and especially the props, massive sets, special effects, the making of the wigs and costumes, the stunts,” Oda said. ” I saw so many things and was truly touched by everyone’s dedication.” When Godoy giddily asked Oda if he thought the acting was good, Oda responded in kind saying, “It was.” Naturally, Godoy exploded in infectious giggles, making Oda chuckle in return. Godoy’s subsequent question, posed in remarkably fluent Japanese despite only beginning to learn the language in January, inquired of Oda why he made the events in season two so challenging to adapt, given that the Straw Hat’s first season was already an immense undertaking. Another question, mind you, that made Oda chuckle when Godoy remarked on how “huge and crazy” their adventure was before making it to the Grand Line. “It’s tough. I’m very tired,” Godoy said. “In that universe, the Grand Line is the harshest of the seas. We need to shock audiences. That’s why there are giants, and, of course, lots of bounty hunters,” Oda replied, teasing the adventures that lie in wait in the upcoming season. “This needs to be a season full of new, surprising elements. That’s why it’s more challenging.” Godoy’s final question asked Oda how he came up with Luffy and made him such a depth-filled and endearing character, despite seeming like a simple fellow upon first blush. “Luffy is an ideal child for me. When you become an adult and join a company, you can’t always do what you want. Entering society often means losing freedom. Luffy has a child’s heart, so he does whatever he wants,” Oda said. “That aspect is probably, for adults already toiling in society, and to children about to enter society, what makes Luffy so appealing.” Oda wasn’t remiss in throwing a compliment Godoy’s way congratulating him on bringing Luffy to life and energizing audiences worldwide. The two then share a loving embrace. It’s very sweet. © Netflix Alongside Godoy, returning cast members on the voyage of Netflix’s One Piece live-action series include Mackenyu as Zoro, Emily Rudd as Nami, Jacob Romero as Usopp, Taz Skylar as Sanji, Ilia Isorelys Paulino as Alvida, Jeff Ward as Buggy, and Michael Dorman as Gold Roger. One Piece‘s second season will also see a crop of new faces from the anime make the jump to live action. Key among the new faces along the journey (and the actors who will be bringing them to life) are: Charithra Chandran as Miss Wednesday (Nefertari Vivi) Joe Manganiello as Mr. 0 (Crocodile) Katey Sagal as Dr. Kureha Lera Abova as Miss All Sunday (Nico Robin) Mark Harelik as Dr. Hiriluk Sendhil Ramamurthy as Nefertari Cobra Brendan Sean Murray as Brogy Callum Kerr as Smoker Camrus Johnson as Mr. 5 Clive Russell as Crocus Daniel Lasker as Mr. 9 David Dastmalchian as Mr. 3 Jazzara Jaslyn as Miss Valentine Julia Rehwald as Tashigi Rob Colletti as Wapol Ty Keogh as Dalton Werner Coetser as Dorry Maintaining their usual secrecy, Netflix and Tomorrow Studios have not yet disclosed the actor who will bring the Straw Hat pirates’ doctor, Tony Tony Chopper, to live. All we’ve seen of the hard working reindeer is a shot of him from behind, confirming—to some fans’ dismay—that he won’t be a muppet but a little CGI dude. Hopefully the next One Piece sit-down (or teaser trailer) will show off Chopper in all of his cute glory. © Netflix In io9’s review of season one, we lauded the Netflix show for not requiring viewers to have invested in the anime to appreciate it, writing, “The show was clean. It was slick. Everything fit together, and at the end of the season, despite Luffy yelling again, I wanted a second season.” In tandem with a second live-action season, Netflix also has plans in motion for a remake of the anime, titled The One Piece, animated by WIT Studio. In short, now’s as good a time as any to get into One Piece—be it through the manga, live action show, the ongoing anime, or its upcoming remake. Want more io9 news?
