  "text": "A new startup called Skylark has taken flight today — with TNW lending an extra set of wings. The company launches with a central mission: empowering non-technical founders to quickly create high-quality Minimum Viable Products (MVPs). To bring their plans to life, Skylark has created an AI-enhanced framework that promises rapid, efficient iteration cycles. Freelance developers apply the framework to build the MVP. While they code, Skylark’s internal team handles the client acquisition. Every solution is customised for the founder’s objectives. By drawing from a pool of freelancers, Skylark can then find developers that fit each project’s specific needs.  The MVPs are designed to scale in the real world. Throughout the build, Skylark provides founders with strategic insights and expert support. “We help them launch faster, cheaper, and better than traditional agencies,” Steven Kleinveld, the startup’s CEO and co-founder, told TNW. “And we do that mainly due to our framework.” Kleinveld has strong links to TNW. He recently completed an internship as a startup scout at TNW Programs, which he credits with kickstarting his plans for Skylark. He has also chosen TNW City for Skylark’s headquarters.  From the Amsterdam office, he’s developed a roadmap to quickly deliver MVPs. The process begins with an assessment of the client’s needs and goals. After setting out the deliverables and timelines, Skylark analyses the market and competition to refine the project plan. Developers then build a flexible, code-based prototype.  Finally, the prototype is refined into a polished MVP. Clients also receive the full codebase — and advice on how to use it. Additionally, Skylark offers further guidance on features, design, SEO, and strategy. The plans aim to solve common problems for non-technical founders.

Credit: Skylark Technical issues for founders Many of the world’s most successful startups had non-technical founders, from Pinterest’s Ben Silbermann and Airbnb’s Brian Chesky to Tinder’s Whitney Wolfe Herd and Snap’s Evan Spiegel. But there could have been many more. Countless big ideas never become big businesses, because the minds behind them are short on coding skills. Kleinveld has first-hand experience of the issues. While studying business at the University of Amsterdam, he attempted to code his own projects. “I’m not overly technical, and it took me months to build not even MVPs, but just apps. And it frustrated me, because I had so many ideas,” he said. He discovered that many other entrepreneurs experienced similar problems. One common issue was that lengthy development cycles led them to miss the ideal time for market entry. Another was lacking the technical expertise to evaluate and collaborate with developers. Skylark aims to resolve these problems.  Key to the plans is an array of AI enhancements to the development process. Among them are the app builder Lovable — one of Europe’s fastest-growing startups — the code builder Cursor, and the versatile ChatGPT Pro. By blending AI with a product delivery framework and a pool of developers, Skylark hopes to give flight to a new flock of founders. As Kleinveld puts it: “If the idea is stuck on the ground, we launch it into the sky.” Whether you’re a non-technical founder or a coding genius, this summer’s TNW Conference will offer numerous insights on building successful startups. The event takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam. To get 30% off your ticket, use the code TNWXMEDIA2025 at the check-out.",
