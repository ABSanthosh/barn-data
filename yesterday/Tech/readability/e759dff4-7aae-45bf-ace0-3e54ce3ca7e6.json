  "text": "Ethan Hawke is back and terrorizing some more kids in Blumhouse's 'Black Phone 2.' Those weekend teases had to lead up to something, right? Blumhouse unveiled a full first look at Black Phone 2 during its CCPX panel, and if you’ve ever wanted to see Ethan Hawke ice skate toward someone he intends to murder, this sequel will be for you. With main baddie the Grabber (Hawke) dead, the sequel picks up years after the first, the now teenage Finney (Mason Thames) and Gwen (Madeline McGraw) Blake dealing with another Colorado winter. Soon, Gwen finds herself dreaming of the Grabber’s lair and three young boys who’ve been killed dead at Alpine Lake Youth Camp. Using a black payphone near the camp, the Grabber calls the teens up saying he’s looking to kill them: either in their dreams or potentially in the real world, he’s gonna get his revenge. Talking to THR, returning director/co-writer Scott Derrickson called Black Phone 2 a ghost story like its predecessor, but one where “the ghost is the villain.” And with the kids aged up, he and co-writer C. Robert Cargill were excited to “ratchet up the intensity,” since Finn and Gwen in high school makes for a “more violent, scarier, more graphic” film. Black Phone 2 hits theaters on October 17 and also stars Jeremy Davies, Anna Lore, Arianna Rivas, Miguel Mora, and Demián Bichir.
