  "description": "Elon Musk has reportedly fired Omead Afshar, Tesla's head of manufacturing and operations in North America and Europe, according to Forbes. Both CNBC and Bloomberg corroborated the report. Afshar's exit follows Milan Kovac, the head of engineering on Tesla's Optimus robot, who left the company in early June. Afshar was promoted to the role last year, Bloomberg reports, after working for multiple different Musk-owned companies since 2017. The timing of his exit isn't particularly surprising given the trouble Tesla has faced selling cars. Sales in Europe have shrunk for a fifth consecutive month and the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association reports that registrations of new Teslas dropped by nearly 41 percent in May. The company is also struggling in China, where sales fell 15 percent in the same month. While Musk appears to be holding Afshar responsible, the blame clearly lies at Musk's feet. Helping to fund President Donald Trump's re-election in the US, running the destructive DOGE cost-cutting efforts after his election and just generally maintaining a noxious public presence have permanently tainted Musk and his companies. While SpaceX still benefits from government contracts, Tesla's sales are vulnerable to public opinion, something the Tesla Takedown movement has been leveraging to its advantage with protests outside of the company's dealerships.  Firing Afshar, leaving his position in the US government and launching Tesla's robotaxi service in Austin are all different attempts from Musk to change the narrative around Tesla. It's not clear yet whether they'll actually help.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/elon-musk-reportedly-fired-a-key-tesla-executive-following-another-month-of-flagging-sales-205118891.html?src=rss",
