Reviews ethics statement Amazon is taking over creative control of the James Bond franchise, and Jeff Bezos wants your thoughts on who should play the next 007. Freelance writer Amanda C.

The billionaire Amazon founder may have a big say in who gets cast in one of the film world's most iconic roles: Bond. James Bond. And fans have the opportunity to champion their favorite actors and try to capture Bezos' attention.Bezos kicked off a flurry of activity among Bond aficionados by posting a simple question to social media on Thursday: \"Who'd you pick as the next Bond?\" Bezos included a screenshot of a Reuters article highlighting the news that the Bond franchise's long-time producers have handed creative control of the action films to Amazon. Henry Cavill as James Bond? Enlarge Image From Russia With Two-Day Delivery? Henry Cavill played Superman in the 2013 movie Man of Steel. He has a wealth of experience in action roles. Warner Bros.If Bezos actually reads the Instagram comments, then he'll know who the general public is pulling for to take over as 007. A quick survey of the responses shows one name in particular popping up repeatedly. Henry Cavill may have played the American superhero Superman, but he's very British. \"I think the world has gone mad if Henry Cavill isn't offered this role,\" said one commenter.British actor Idris Elba also got a few mentions, though when asked back in 2018, he said he wouldn't be the next Bond. Maybe he'll change his mind.Read more: Every James Bond Movie Ranked -- the Best and Worst of 007Elba is the personal favorite of Bond expert Colin Burnett, a film and media studies professor at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. Burnett, however, fears Elba has \"aged out\" of the role. \"I think it's time from a Black Bond,\" Burnett tells CNET. \"Blockbuster movies with Black stars are now global hits, including in East Asia, which is a large market for Bond.\"Cavill might be a popular choice, but some fans are thinking outside the box. There was at least one vote for American comedian Kevin Hart. Whoopi Goldberg, known for her work on Star Trek and as a co-host of The View, received a shoutout as well.Amazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Bezos' level of involvement with creative or casting decisions for the franchise.Amazon takes creative control of James Bond Enlarge Image No Prime to Die? Daniel Craig was the most recent James Bond, but he stepped down from the role in 2021. MGM/Universal PicturesAmazon closed a multibillion-dollar deal to buy MGM Studios in 2022 and formed Amazon MGM Studios. MGM has been the home of the Bond series, with every Bond movie now streaming on Amazon's Prime Video -- for an extra fee of around $4 to rent each movie, or about $15 to buy, depending on the age of the movie.While the Bond film franchise is a big business, it's also been a family venture under the control of producers Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli.\"With my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects,\" said Wilson in an Amazon statement on Feb. 20. \"Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.\"Read more: Being James Bond: How 007 Movies Got Me Into Intelligence WorkThe long-time producers and Amazon MGM will remain co-owners of the franchise. \"Since the MGM acquisition, Amazon has held rights to distribute all of the James Bond films, and as a result of this transaction will have creative control over future productions,\" Amazon said. That's why Bezos' Instagram post carries some weight. \"The Bond franchise is one of the most resilient in the history of the business. It has had to be. It's had many owners over time,\" says Burnett. Burnett notes the franchise's future could be complicated, especially if Amazon explores spin-off series much like Disney has done with Star Wars. He expects Amazon to maintain a \"mothership\" theatrical series, but can envision streaming series like a Moneypenny spinoff or a revival of the James Bond Jr. animated show.Though famous on film, the suave superspy debuted in a series of novels by Ian Fleming. Many actors, from Sean Connery to Pierce Brosnan, have played the role. Daniel Craig was the most recent 007, but he stepped away from the character after No Time to Die in 2021. The blockbuster movie handily topped the $700 million mark.The next actor to play James Bond will have big shoes and even bigger action scenes to fill. It can be a long commitment. Craig's run started in 2006. (Then again, there was also the one-and-done George Lazenby). Expect some things to stay the same, no matter who steps into the role. Tuxedos, martinis, fast cars and devious gadgets should be along for the ride, whether it's fan-favorite Cavill or a dark-horse candidate on board.Time will tell what Amazon ultimately plans to do with Bond. Says Burnett, \"Expect what we've come to expect, over and over again. A new Bond era.\"Correction, Feb. 20: This article was updated to correct Colin Burnett's university affiliation.
