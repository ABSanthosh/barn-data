As one of the largest breweries in Brazil and the only major one with 100% Brazilian capital, Grupo Petrópolis offers a diverse portfolio of brands, including Itaipava, the most consumed beer in Brazilian households. With eight factories across six Brazilian states, 160 distribution centers and a fleet of more than 3,500 trucks, our products are available in 600,000 points of sale nationwide.More than 11,000 of our employees — ranging from administrative staff, sales representatives, trade marketers and drivers — rely on corporate applications and devices to perform their duties which makes maintaining peak operational efficiency crucial to our mission.We needed a comprehensive device management solution that would help enhance security and boost productivity which prompted our partner, SAFIRA Soluções \u0026 Tecnologia to recommend Android Enterprise.Simplifying app and device updates for better device managementBefore implementing our current device management strategy, our mobile device program, which served sales representatives, marketing staff and drivers, faced major obstacles which led to inefficiencies and financial losses. Software updates required manual action from employees, causing significant delays and inconsistent execution and with up to 60 devices lost monthly, we faced substantial operational and logistical costs.Android Enterprise played a crucial role in enhancing both security and cost-effectiveness. With improved security measures on devices managed by SAFIRA and Grupo Petrópolis’ loss prevention programs, we reduced the number of lost devices from 60 per month to 10. Android Enterprise's remote wipe feature was essential in our security efforts. Now, if a device is lost or stolen we can remotely erase company data on the device, helping to eliminate security risk.SAFIRA, an Android Enterprise Gold Partner, showed us that Android Enterprise, paired with the cloud4mobile MDM solution by Brazilian manufacturer Mobiltec, could address our productivity and management challenges. By equipping employees with Motorola devices managed through Android Enterprise, smartphone provisioning became much simpler and delivered significant cost savings. In fact, these devices are more affordable than our previous ones, resulting in over 20% savings on hardware purchases.Boosting employee productivity with improved technical supportGrupo Petrópolis used Android Enterprise to reduce excessive data consumption and its impact on productivity. By implementing the Android Enterprise Recommended cloud4mobile MDM solution, we created customized profiles for different roles and restricted personal app usage on company devices. This helps employees stay within data limits and minimize distractions, ultimately boosting their productivity. Today, the devices are 100% dedicated to professional use.Android Enterprise’s remote management capabilities have also helped optimize our technical support. Instead of lengthy device shipments, we resolve most issues in under an hour with SAFIRA’s support team, ensuring that employees have the correct, most up-to-date apps for their job function. As a result, we have increased productivity time by 50% and boosted the availability of essential mobile tools for our workforce from 80% to 96%. By benefiting both employees and technical teams, Android Enterprise’s management capabilities have proven to be a strategic advantage for our mobile workforce by reducing costs, improving security, and boosting productivity across the organization.To learn more about Android Enterprise, check out a self-guided demo or contact a solution partner of your choice.",
