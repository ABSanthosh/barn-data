Credit: JULIA DEMAREE NIKHINSON / POOL / AFP via Getty Images Donald Trump is officially the 47th President as of Inauguration Day. In a 30-minute speech, Trump proclaimed that \"the golden age of America begins right now,\" and promised many changes. Here are a few of them below, along with how viewers on social media reacted to it:Declaring a national emergency at the southern borderTrump ran on an anti-immigration stance, discussing ending birthright citizenship and planning sweeping deportations during his campaign. On Monday, Trump mentioned that he would declare a national emergency at the southern border of the U.S., halting immigration. Trump used the term \"criminal aliens,\" which was stated several times in Project 2025 (the conservative policy wishlist for Trump's second term). Following the speech, the Trump administration shut down CBP One, an app for migrants to legally enter the U.S. The effects were instant: Tweet may have been deleted 'Rescinding' the Green New DealThe \"Green New Deal\" isn't the law of the land, despite efforts by progressive politicians in recent years. On Inauguration Day, however, Trump promised to \"terminate\" spending on the Green New Deal. Axious speculated that he meant Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which did address climate change.Still, social media was quick to note that Biden didn't run nor try to enact the Green New Deal: Tweet may have been deleted Sen. Ed Markey, who did run on the Green New Deal, came to X to express his feelings: Tweet may have been deleted Make an official policy that there are \"only\" two gendersIt's no secret that Trump's policies are a threat to trans people, and since his first term trans people said Trump is \"not a friend.\" On Monday, Trump said he would instate an official policy that there are \"only\" two genders, male and female. Mashable Top Stories Trans journalist Erin Reed posted on Bluesky that, \"It's going to be quite a slog for 4 years\": Multiple people pointed out that Trump stated this soon after declaring that \"free expression will no longer be limited\": Tweet may have been deleted Tweet may have been deleted 4. 'Bring back' freedom of speechTrump said he'll sign an executive order to stop \"government censorship\" and \"bring back free speech in America.\"While it's not immediately clear what Trump means by this, page 687 of Project 2025 recommends Trump \"[s]upport free speech and hold big tech accountable. Immediately conduct a thorough review of federal policy regarding free speech online and provide policy solutions to address big tech’s censorship of speech.\" That was a pretty quick segue from \"we're bringing back free speech and ending government censorship\" to \"here are the things government employees will be no longer allowed to say about sex, gender, and race.\"— Seth Cotlar (@sethcotlar.bsky.social) January 20, 2025 at 12:32 PM Project 2025 also calls for the removal of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, which Trump also mentioned during Monday's speech: 5. Ending DEI policiesTrump called for an \"end [to] the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life,\" an usher in a society that is \"colorblind\" and \"merit-based.\"People online retorted, saying such actions don't decrease inflation. Tweet may have been deleted 6. Renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of AmericaThe notion to rename the region to the Gulf of America isn't new, but Trump has run with it in recent months. He mentioned it in his inaugural speech on Monday. Tweet may have been deleted Tweet may have been deleted As Trump's first 100 days unfold, we'll see which of these policies he tries to enact.
