  "text": "By the time Mephisto, played by Sacha Baron Cohen, appeared at the end of Ironheart to strike a sinister deal with Riri Williams, it felt almost anticlimactic for Marvel fans. That’s because it was long anticipated that the character would appear on WandaVision, or perhaps, when that didn’t happen, its witchy spin-off Agatha All Along. There were certainly teases about it, but it wasn’t meant to be until Marvel’s most recent series—and that’s according to Kevin Feige himself. As reported by CBR, the Marvel boss came clean about Mephisto in a recent roundtable interview. “He was never part of WandaVision … But the enthusiasm with which he was theorized on that certainly was cool, and was fun to watch, and he’s another character that, pre-MCU, it would have been, ‘How do you (do Mephisto)? He’s the devil? How do you do that character?’ But he’s a formative character! He was a big part of Thanos’s storyline in the comics. So again, now that he’s here, the potential is—the plan is clear, theoretically, to use more of him.” “Theoretically,” Feige said, but now that Mephisto is out of the bag, the next place your mind goes is Spider-Man: Brand New Day, given the character’s importance in the comic book arc of the same name. Even though the story won’t be the same (for one thing, there’s not a big-screen Peter and Mary Jane marriage to mess with yet), certainly some inspiration might be taken. What do you think? Were you expecting to see Mephisto much earlier in the MCU? Spider-Man: Brand New Day hits theaters July 31, 2026. Want more io9 news?
