  "text": "CNET's Bridget Carey takes a look at Hyundai Mobis' new holographic window display at CES 2025 One of the biggest issues with having a bunch of screens in your car is that it's distracting when you're trying to drive. Well, I'm trying out a concept car from Hyundai Mobis that puts everything on the windshield in a new type of technology. This isn't a typical HUD. It's using projectors to kind of show me information, and the passenger cannot see this stuff, and I can't see what the passenger sees. So here at CES, this little demonstration. I kind of showing me how I'm seeing my MPH hovering here in front of me. If I shift my head, it's gone. It's kind of like a weird little magic effect of sorts because what it's doing, it's projecting the image on a special film right here and what makes it unique compared to other things is that it is controlling the light in different ways. For example, if you're driving into the sun and it's really bright, it's not going to be affected by that. I can't test that here, but that's how they're explaining. Technology to me. OK, so right now I'm seeing, you know how fast I'm traveling, what the speed limit is. I'm getting directions over there I can kind of tell you what music I'm listening to. If I wanted to, I can put even more. I can put the weather, but if I'm changing lanes, that is when it's going to start giving me other mirrors. Oh, see, right there I can see, oh, who's coming up on my left, what's on my right, and I can kind of get a different field of view from the cameras that are around the car if you want navigation. Services you can also have that projected so you're not taking your eyes off the road if you want some sort of mapping system to be able to see you know where you're going on your journey. It's all just kind of overlaid on top of everything. I'm not really um changing my focus all that much. I mean, in this example I'm seeing a television screen, obviously I'm not really driving, but I'm looking forward and just shifting my eyes ever so slightly down and I'm not wildly looking around the car or turning my head. Too much to be able to see where I'm going, so it kind of has some interesting safety features here. I'm not a big fan of too many screens in a car. I think they're distracting. So this is a step in a good direction. And also what's interesting too though is the passenger can't see how fast I'm driving. You ever been a passenger and you kind of want to eyeball what the driver's doing, you won't be able to get that in this concept because there's nothing on the dash. It's all just my. Little secret over here. So while I'm focused on the road, the passenger can do things like watch movies, play games. We saw an example where someone was playing the game through an app connection on their phone, so they could do whatever they want, and I'll never know. With this SOIS concept, they have other ways they can take tech to another level. Let's say I'm feeling like I'm a little stressed or maybe someone gets dozy on the road. Well, They have other types of technologies to be able to hook into your brain waves and say, hey, maybe if I'm getting a little stressed or a little sleepy, this display might tell me something to help me wake up or they can even adjust the lighting or the vibration and heat of my seat or the music to help me be more focused or be less stressed on the road. Another thing you might not be able to tell from just watching at home is that this. The screen that it's being projected on is up to 95% transparent. You know, I don't need to have it on all the way, you know, but I can still see through it completely. I'm looking right now through the road. I see the crosswalk. I see the dotted lines. It's not like a computer screen that's taking up everything. I know it's just a concept, but as someone who does not buy cars with screens, you know what? I can dig this. Let me know what you think. Thanks for watching.",
