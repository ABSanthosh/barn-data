  "description": "After finalizing loan terms with the IMF, El Salvador's Legislative Assembly approved changes to the country's Bitcoin Law last week by a 55-2 vote, \"effectively removing bitcoin's status as legal currency,\" reports Reason. Under the new rules, bitcoin is no longer considered \"currency,\" though it remains \"legal tender.\" Another change makes using bitcoin entirely voluntary. (Previously, the law mandated that businesses accept bitcoin for any goods or services they provided.) Additionally, bitcoin can no longer be used to pay taxes or settle government debts. The government is also stepping back from its involvement in Chivo Wallet, the state-backed digital wallet... The reforms come as part of a broader financial agreement between Bukele and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). One of the conditions for a proposed $1.4 billion Extended Fund Facility loan was that El Salvador mitigate \"potential risks of the Bitcoin project.\" The IMF has been critical of the country's crypto policies since Bukele made bitcoin legal tender in 2021. \"There are large risks associated with using Bitcoin as legal tender, especially given the high volatility of its price. We don't recommend it,\" the organization said in 2022. Despite these changes, the administration insists it remains committed to bitcoin. Milena Mayorga, El Salvador's ambassador to the United States, has said that El Salvador is still a \"bitcoin country\" and will maintain — and even expand — its bitcoin reserves. \"You have to adapt to the current situation and this is the decision that was taken in the Assembly, but that does not mean that the country will stop having a bitcoin reserve,\" she explained. Government data suggests El Salvador now holds 6,072 Bitcoin worth $586,888,000. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
