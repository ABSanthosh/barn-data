  "text": "Apple is denying all wrongdoing, but it might still owe you money. Credit: Sirichai Puangsuwan/Shutterstock If you had an Apple Watch between 2015 and February of last year, there’s a chance the company might owe you a small payout. That’s thanks to a recent $20 million settlement on a class action lawsuit over swollen batteries.Apple has denied all wrongdoing, saying in a statement sent to Lifehacker sister publication CNET that “we strongly disagree with the claims made against these early generation Apple Watch models.” Still, rather than move forward with legal fees, the company is just choosing to pay a lump sum and get it over with instead. Given that the lawsuit, Smith et al. v. Apple Inc, lasted for over five years, that’s understandable. Getting your piece of the settlement might not be so simple, however. In order to qualify, you need to have already taken action, having reported battery swelling on an Apple Watch first-generation, Series 1, Series 2, or Series 3 model to Apple between April 24, 2015 and Feb. 6, 2024. If that sounds like you, you do not need to submit a claim, but there are a few steps you can take to ensure payment.First, keep an eye out for an email or postcard notifying you of your eligibility for payment. This will have a notice ID or confirmation code, which you’ll then need to enter on the settlement website to update your payment information. You’ll have until April 10 to send this information over, and if you feel like you should qualify but don’t get a notice, you can also reach out to a toll free number or the settlement administrator’s address to get the ball rolling, per section 7 of the settlement site’s FAQ.Alternatively, if you’d rather opt out of the settlement, which will preserve your right to pursue your own legal action against Apple, you can do so through the same process. Once the dust has settled, class members can expect a payout of about $20 per affected watch, although specifics might vary depending on the number of people who update their payment information, capping out at $50 per affected watch.
