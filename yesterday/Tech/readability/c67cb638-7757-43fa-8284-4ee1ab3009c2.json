  "text": "Did you ask for \"AI Mode\"? Credit: Google When Google rolled out AI Overviews for Search last year, it didn't go over so well. The company's AI made some pretty massive mistakes with its results, many of which went viral. In response, Google pulled back the feature, reworked it, and slowly reintroduced it to the masses. You've probably noticed. This month, Google is continuing its work of adding AI to Search—whether you want it or not. First, it's rolling out a new version of AI Overviews that's powered by Gemini 2.0, the company's latest AI model. Google says this update will help with \"harder questions,\" like coding, math, and multimodal (prompts using different types of media) requests. In addition, teens can now see AI Overviews, as can users without a Google Account. Yippee. Introducing AI ModeBut the larger AI announcement from Google is something the company is currently testing: AI Mode. See, Google says that they've heard from \"power users\" that they are looking for AI responses from more of their Google searches. In response, AI Mode lets you ask the AI multi-part questions, that offers more advanced reasoning, thinking, and multimodal functions.On paper, it sounds like a more complex AI Overview, but it's a bit more nuanced than that. AI Mode is its own tab in Search, that turns the UI into more of what you'd expect from ChatGPT or Gemini. Google says this experience is supposed to combine what would've taken multiple searches into one: You ask the AI something complicated, it reasons through it (showing its thinking along the way) and delivers a full answer with multiple results, claims, and summaries—citing its sources for each of its generations. Credit: Google Google says AI Mode uses a “query fan-out” technique to generate its results. Essentially, it searches for multiple related things at the same time, combining those results together into the response you see at the end. AI Mode pulls from many different data points for its results, including web results, Google's Knowledge Graph, and shopping data. Google uses the following query to demonstrate this approach: “What's the difference in sleep tracking features between a smart ring, smartwatch and tracking mat?\" AI Mode supposedly takes that multi-part question, develops a multistep \"plan\" to conduct a number of searches to find the information, and changes that plan according to the results it returns.This is still obviously a work in progress (as AI search is across the board) so Google says AI Mode won't get it right all the time. In fact, you may simply see a result of just web links, if the program thinks the AI result isn't good enough. I'm not sure how useful AI Mode actually is, especially when compared to either searching with Gemini, or a traditional Google Search (especially one without the AI). I'll need to wait until Google lets me try the feature out for myself before making any judgement calls. My guess, though, based on my current experience with AI, is that I'll prefer the usual Search method.How to try Google's AI ModeIf you have any interest in trying Google's new AI Mode, there are a couple ways to get in. First, if you are a Google One AI Premium subscriber, you'll be among the first to be invited to try out AI Mode in Labs. If you aren't a subscriber, however, you'll need to jump on the waitlist. Sign into your Google Account, then head to Google Labs. Under \"Introducing the AI Mode Experiment,\" choose \"Join waitlist.\" Google will then bring you to a page advertising the feature, where you can confirm you are on the waitlist.
