Their concerns follow the government’s announcement that defence spending will increase to its highest level since the Cold War.

Russia’s war in Ukraine continues to cast a wide shadow over the continent.  Andriy Dovbenko, founder of the UK-Ukraine TechExchange, said the document rightly acknowledges Russia as a threat to all of Europe, but warned that funding alone won’t guarantee success. “Simply increasing UK defence spending without structural changes won’t work,” Dovbenko said. Dovbenko pointed to Ukraine’s wartime innovation model as a potential blueprint.   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy quickly integrated startup-made military tech into the country’s defence efforts early on in its war with Moscow. From AI-powered reconnaissance tools to low-cost drones, local startups now play a critical role on the front lines.   “World-leading defence innovation would not have happened in Ukraine without drastic changes to the procurement process, bringing technology startups and scaleups into the inner fold of the industry,” Dovbenko said.  Defence tech startups often struggle to break into the traditionally conservative military tech procurement process, dominated by legacy contractors or “primes” such as Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Boeing.  Military tech procurement takes an average of 6.5 years for projects with a value of more than £20mn, according to data from British think tank Chatham House. While some provisions in the SDR suggest a shift toward more open innovation and faster procurement cycles, tech insiders want clarity on how that will be implemented in practice.  If you want to catch the talk from NATO DIANA’s COO or anything else on the packed agenda for TNW Conference, we have a special offer for you.
