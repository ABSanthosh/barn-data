  "text": "Make sure you grab yours before it runs out of stock everywhere. The Nintendo Switch 2 is generating massive hype but if you haven’t preordered yet, you may want to know that stock is already very low at most retailers. Most retailers have limited allocations and not every customer is going to be guaranteed a unit at launch. Among the handful of stores still regularly stocking, Walmart is one of the sole retailers where you can still preorder and with some added perks that make it your best option. Preorders start on April 24 at midnight Eastern Time (12:00 a.m. ET), the equivalent of 9:00 p.m. Pacific Time on April 23. The sale allows gamers nationwide to place orders from home but the demand is so robust that most retailers will sell out immediately. Walmart has a steady supply of both the standard Nintendo Switch 2 console at $449 and the Mario Kart World bundle at $499, and it guarantees the delivery on launch day (June 5). Preorder Switch 2 at Walmart Preorder Switch 2 + Mario Kart at Walmart Launch Day Delivery The offer that truly sets Walmart apart from the other retailers is the guarantee of launch-day delivery which is June 5. Customers preordering through Walmart by 8 a.m. local time on June 4 will have their console delivered for free by 9 a.m. local time on June 5—launch day, no less. That guarantee is a valuable benefit especially when you know that many other retailers can’t promise launch-day delivery due to low inventory. If you don’t want to suffer the frustration of waiting in endless lines or indefinite shipping dates, Walmart is a great choice. The Nintendo Switch 2 console itself is ready with everything necessary for a seamless gaming experience: The box contains the console, Joy-Con 2 controllers (left and right), Joy-Con 2 Grip, Joy-Con 2 Straps, Nintendo Switch 2 Dock, ultra high-speed HDMI cable, AC adapter, and a USB-C charging cable. This means that you can play immediately without the need to make additional accessory purchases. As you probably know the Switch 2 is a significant upgrade from the original: It features a larger, crisper 7.9-inch 1080p display for handheld play and 4K output when docked to a TV which offers stunning visuals, and HDR support. The console also boasts improved processing capabilities for smoother gameplay and faster load times, along with improved audio for a better overall experience. With demand through the roof and supplies limited, most retailers will sell out shortly after preorders open. Walmart is one of the few places accepting preorders but make sure you get yours before it runs out of stock (like it’s the case in the UK). If you want to reserve your place as one of the earliest to receive the Switch 2 when it’s released on June 5, your best bet is to act quickly and go with Walmart.
