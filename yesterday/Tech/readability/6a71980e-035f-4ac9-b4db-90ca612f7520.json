  "text": "Overview Best free dating app overall OkCupid Jump to Details Best dating app for 30s and 40s Hinge Jump to Details Best dating app for women Bumble Jump to Details Table of Contents Given inflation across the U.S. and beyond, living has become increasingly expensive. Dating isn't immune to this. Mashable has previously reported that the cost of living crisis in the UK specifically has impacted the way we date, and that's no doubt the case for people elsewhere, too. Between paying for drinks, outfits, and commuting, some singles may have to make tough financial decisions around dates. This could also mean not paying for dating apps. Thankfully, it is possible to use many popular dating apps for free.What dating apps are free?Major dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge all have free tiers, as does Grindr and OkCupid.Some users have recently complained that apps have placed various features behind paywalls. Mashable has reported that Grindr users are one such consumer base. Grindr has in recent years limited the visibility of \"taps\" (which indicate interest without a direct message), and the \"explore\" page (that allows users to see others not in their location) only unlocks one new profile a day, whereas it used to unlock three. There could be several reasons for this. Many mainstream apps are owned by public companies. Grindr, for example, is public, as is Match Group, the parent company behind Tinder and Hinge. When a company is beholden to shareholders, it has pressure to make more money and thus monetize features.Another reason is that companies aren't immune to inflation, either. It might cost more to operate now than in years past, and they want to make up for that increased cost somehow.Despite the complaints and potential increased paywalls (and ads), these apps do function for free. But it might be like paying for the lower-tier of a streaming service: You won't have all the bells and whistles.  More robust dating apps (that started as dating sites) like eharmony and Match require you to pay in order to match or chat with other users. Even in 2025, though, there are a good number of dating apps you can use for free. We rounded up apps where you can find your forever partner, a casual encounter, or something in between — without paying a dime. Our Pick OkCupid Best free dating app overall Read our full review of OKCupid.Who it's for:Sick of arguing with dudes about basic human rights on first dates or swiping through an endless parade of misogynistic profiles? OkCupid might be the best dating app for you. OKC and its users are seriously liberal and open-minded — you're way less likely to run into anyone sporting a \"Make America Great Again\" hat or ranting about building a wall.And if you're into non-monogamy, OkCupid actually gets it. Set it as a preference, and boom — you'll only see other people who are into the same thing. Why we picked this:Owned by Match Group, OKC delivers a seriously hip and inclusive experience for everyone without breaking the bank. It's a dating app that feels fresh, inclusive, and genuinely fun — and that's exactly why we think it's the best free dating app out there. OKC's free version is surprisingly impressive: You can create a detailed profile, answer personality questions, browse potential matches, and even send messages without entering your credit card details. This is a huge win for anyone on a budget who doesn't want to waste money on premium features just to get started. Its profile-building process is more like taking a personality quiz than filling out a boring form. It asks you about everything from simple stuff like whether you smoke and drink to more intimate questions like how many dates you typically wait before sleeping with someone. (Bonus points for answering them all — the more you share, the better your matches.)All in all, OkCupid is the perfect happy medium for progressive folks who don't want anything to do with trendy swiping apps but don't want to feel like they're desperately looking for marriage, either. The Good The Bad Details The Good The Bad Details Read our full breakdown of Tinder vs. Bumble.Who it's for:Craving a quick hookup, a no-strings-attached fling, or a way to kill some time? Download Tinder. This app is the digital equivalent of that slightly sketchy dive bar down the street: a little rough around the edges, always open, and full of people looking for a good time (or at least a temporary escape from reality). With a massive and active user base, you'll find matches anywhere, from the busiest cities to the smallest towns. So, if you're not looking for anything serious and want to have some fun without breaking the bank (or your heart), Tinder's probably your best bet.Why we picked this:You can't talk about online dating without talking about Tinder: most people you know have downloaded it at least once, everyone has an opinion on it, and it's just too damn popular to ignore. We all love to hate on the swipe-happy hookup app, but it's undeniably effective, and, most importantly for our purposes, it's got a killer free version.Tinder isn't perfect, but it's incredibly user-friendly, instantly connects you with potential partners, and has a huge pool of singles just waiting to mingle (or whatever). It's no wonder it's the first app most people download when they need a quick ego boost or a no-strings-attached fling.If you want to level up your Tinder game, they offer paid options like Tinder Plus, Gold, and Platinum. (Gold and Platinum include everything in Tinder Plus and then some.) These premium subscriptions auto-renew, but cancellation is easy enough — just go into the app and change your preferences.To help you get more matches, Tinder introduced a Photo Selector feature that uses AI to pick your best pics. (We're not sure how safe this is, even if they say they delete your data.) They've also added a verification feature that requires ID or passport photos to help weed out the fakes and catfishers. That said, each time you open the app is a gamble. Your next Tinder match could be your future spouse, or it might just be some rando asking if you're DTF. That's just the unpredictable nature of modern love, especially when it's free and readily available at your fingertips. The Good The Bad Details Hinge Best dating app for 30s and 40s Who it's for:Hinge is basically the Goldilocks of dating apps: not too casual, not too serious, but just right for singles who are actually looking for a relationship but aren't quite ready to fill out a 10-page questionnaire and commit to finding \"the one.\" It's where you go when you finally realize you're done with Tinder.Hinge prides itself on being the app \"designed to be deleted,\" meaning they actually want you to find a lasting connection — a good fit — so you can get off dating apps for good (and maybe finally free up some space on your phone).Why we picked this:We're kind of obsessed with Hinge. It's cool, quirky, and refreshingly authentic, making it the perfect app for 20- and 30-somethings who are over the superficial swiping and ghosting culture but don't need anyone asking about their baby-making plans just yet.Hinge has that \"just right\" vibe. You get the modern feel and ease of use of Tinder, but with a focus on building genuine connections (not just racking up matches). Plus, with features like \"Your Turn\" (which gently nudges you to actually respond to messages) and \"Hidden Words\" (which lets you filter out unwanted words, phrases, and emojis), Hinge is actively trying to create a more positive and engaging dating experience.If you want to see everyone who likes you or send unlimited likes, Hinge offers multiple premium subscription options, but having endless potential matches is overwhelming (and reminiscent of the more anxiety-provoking Tinder). They also have \"Roses,\" which let you show someone you're really into them (very Bachelor vibes). And speaking of putting your best foot forward, Hinge recently launched \"Prompt Feedback,\" an AI-powered feature designed to help you polish your prompt responses. This new feature doesn't tell you exactly what to write, but it gives you helpful nudges and suggestions to make sure you're showcasing your personality in the best possible light. The Good The Bad Details Bumble Best dating app for women Who it's for:Because women and non-binary people have to make the first move, Bumble is the ideal app for anyone who's sick of getting unsolicited messages from creepy dudes (or just tired of the same old \"hey\" and \"hi\" openers). It's also a refreshing change for men who are tired of always having to initiate conversations.Why we picked this:Bumble takes the best parts of Tinder and Hinge (easy-to-use interface, focus on quality connections) and adds its own unique twist: women and non-binary people make the first move. This creates a more intentional and (hopefully more) respectful environment where you're less likely to encounter those dreaded \"hey\" messages or unsolicited pick-up lines. Bumble's April 2024 update introduced \"Opening Moves,\" giving women and non-binary users the option to set icebreaker questions for matches. They also added new \"Dating Intentions\" badges (e.g., fun, casual dates, life partner), so you're more likely to match with someone who's on the same page. In July 2024, they rolled out another new feature, which lets users report profiles suspected of using AI-generated photos and videos. So, if you come across a profile that looks a little too perfect, you can now flag it for review. Bumble's free version is a solid choice for anyone who wants a straightforward dating app without the usual ick. It's seriously refreshing to be upfront about your dating goals right from the start, so whether you're looking for a hookup or your soulmate, Bumble's got you covered. While we've tested Bumble Premium, the free version has so much to offer, you won't feel pressured to pay just to send messages. Plus, if you're not even looking for a date and just want to expand your social circle, Bumble BFF and Bumble Bizz are awesome alternatives to Facebook or other social media sites.And now, some big news from Bumble HQ: Founder Whitney Wolfe Herd is back as CEO. After stepping down a little over a year ago, she's returning to the helm. Current CEO Lidiane Jones has resigned for \"personal reasons\" and will stay on until Wolfe Herd officially takes over in mid-March. The Good The Bad Details Pure Best anonymous dating app for women Who it's for: Pure is a totally different kind of hookup app — it’s for anyone who’s so over Tinder and wants to explore more adventurous sexual encounters. While Pure is for everyone, it’s only free for female users. Men are required to pay to play, but there are usually huge discounts (like 88% off or more) on the yearly subscription, so it's still a very budget-friendly option, even for the guys.Why we picked this: Hookup apps are kind of gross these days. Think really hard about apps designed solely for hookups — not a pretty picture, right? Pure, on the other hand, is like Tinder’s artsy cousin who lives in Brooklyn and only comes into the City to attend niche gallery openings and off-off-Broadway plays. It’s also completely free for female users (but there’s a paid subscription called Pure Queen that has premium features like incognito mode, “smart likes,” a blocklist, and more). Pure isn’t free for everyone (men are required to pay), but we think this barrier might make it a safer place to connect with people looking for adventure. If they’re paying for it, they’ve got to be serious about what they're looking for. (You can use the code PUREFIRST if you’re new to the app and looking for a discount.)Unlike other dating apps, Pure is based on “ads,” which you can post to your feed. You don’t even have to include a photo if you don’t want to. (You can share up to three non-nude photos via your \"ad.\") You can also add “turn-ons” to your feed to let other users know what you’re into and choose a “looking for” card to make your intentions clear from the get-go. Oh, and chats self-destruct in 24 hours, so that’s nice for the more discreet folks out there.Pure also has a unique “Devil’s Bones” feature that figuratively rolls the dice and connects you with a random user. It starts with an audio chat, and if things go well, you can move to video or text chat. If you’re not into the person, just roll the dice again! And, if someone really pisses you off or pushes your boundaries, you can report and block them — Pure is big on protecting its users. The Good The Bad Details Who it's for:Grindr is the hookup app for gay men and queers who can't stand the heteronormativity of apps like Tinder or Bumble. For guys looking to have no-strings-attached fun, this is the place to be.Let's be real: Grindr users have no chill. It's an NSFW gay paradise, and if you've been thinking that you've met every gay man in your area already, Grindr might be able to show you some newbies who you never knew existed. (Unless you're in a small town, in which case you'll probably see the same people recycled on your feed — but just wait until you go on vacation.)Why we picked this:Grindr is the world's biggest social networking app for gay men, helping singles and frisky couples get it on since 2009. With millions of daily users, it's clearly earned its spot as one of the most popular (and notorious) dating apps.  Instead of swiping, you get a borderline infinite (and often overwhelming) grid of guys near you. It can be a very efficient process if you want it to be, and most users looking for a hookup will make it crystal clear they're not interested in small talk. That's not to say relationships don't happen, but at its core, Grindr is the go-to for quick, casual encounters.Be warned, however: Grindr is hella NSFW. Messages can get freaky fast, and you're 100 percent going to receive a ton of unsolicited (or solicited, if you're into that) dick pics. So, checking Grindr on the train or in line at the grocery store isn't quite as casual as other dating apps. You'll also probably get asked for pics, so be prepared for that.For those who are all about finding a partner in a more traditional, romantic way, other apps (like Archer) might be a better choice; for gay men who strictly want to hook up, this is the Holy Grail. The Good The Bad Details Archer Best dating app for gay men Who it's for:While Grindr is our top pick for fast hookups, we actually think Archer is the best gay dating app if you're looking for love. Archer is a free dating app for gay, bisexual, and queer men. It's the relationship-focused alternative to apps like Grindr and Tinder, providing a \"celebratory place\" for gay men to connect and find meaningful connections. If you're a bisexual man or someone who is HIV positive and you're tired of tip-toeing around to avoid potential hate and discrimination, Archer is your best option. (For real, even Brooklyn's oh-so-gorgeous resident bi-man and author of Boyslut: A Memoir and Manifesto, Zachary Zane, swears by it.)Why we picked this:Archer is a \"social-first\" dating app for gay and queer men. Unlike its raunchy competitor (Grindr), Archer focuses on creating a more inclusive and respectful space for its users. Since its roll-out, it's been downloaded more than 685,000 times. It's 100 percent free to download and use (no sketchy in-app purchases or hidden fees), and it has some unique features like Smart-Blur to keep you from seeing NSFW content until you're ready and Selfie-Verify for added security.Not only that, but Archer is determined to make STD/STI, PrEP awareness, and sexual health a priority for its users. It provides comprehensive resources, education, and support for users via the Health Hub, making it a safer and more informed platform for the LGBTQ+ community than other dating apps. The Good The Bad Details HER Best dating app for queer women Who it's for:HER is the best free dating site for queer, bisexual, trans, and lesbian women. (It's particularly useful if you're over men pretending to be women online or you're just tired of being asked for a threesome by straight couples.) The fact that it's made by queer women for queer women was a much-needed addition to the online dating world, and knowing that it's a safe space is really nice. HER goes way past being a hookup app — that is, without adding pressure to find a romantic partner. While it can be used to couple up and find local matches that you never knew existed, you can also get involved in local LGBTQ events, read LGBTQ news, and make friends through its social-media-like feed.Why we picked this:We recently named HER the best overall dating app for queer women, and for so many reasons. Claiming to be the app that \"introduces you to every lesbian you've ever wanted to meet,\" HER is the award-winning mix of dating and social media that lets you meet girls you know are girls, as it is solely for lesbian, bisexual, and queer women. The language is inclusive — it's not a lesbian site aimed at a male fantasy, thanks to the fact queer women created it — and it'll help you widen your dating pool beyond the circles you already know IRL.Note that HER's user base isn't as large as that of mainstream apps like Tinder, so you might not have as many options as you'd like (especially if you live in a smaller town). A lot of queer women are still on apps like Tinder and Bumble, and unfortunately, on those platforms, you might run into straight girls saying that they're \"interested\" in women to find friends or a threesome. Regardless, HER is making serious strides toward becoming a total boss of an app (and toward taking a ton of queer lady users away from Tinder). The low-pressure atmosphere is super inviting, and the fact that you can find a girlfriend or queer friends or attend an LGBTQ movie night, all thanks to the app, makes HER unique for multiple reasons. It just rocks — in a really gay and really fun kind of way — okay? The Good The Bad Details Who it's for:Plenty of Fish (POF) does have a large user base, so if you're really struggling to find matches elsewhere, you might be able to find someone here. But be prepared for a slightly outdated interface, questionable profiles, and maybe even sketchy messages. If you've exhausted all other options and are willing to brave the depths of the POF ocean, you might find a decent catch. But honestly, there are probably better ways to spend your time (and your dating energy).Why we picked this:Chemistry is the name of the game here, and the multiple questionnaires are no joke. This isn't a quick five-second setup like other apps, but that's only because Plenty of Fish truly wants you to dig a bit deeper so that they can give you the best quality matches. In the \"meeting goals\" section, you can specify whether you're looking for something long-term, looking to date but nothing serious, etc., and then Plenty of Fish will try to match you with others who answered similarly. The idea is to eliminate the awkward \"What are we?\" conversations and set you up for success by pairing you with people who share your priorities. Unlimited messaging can be nice in terms of the actual app use, but people can send you messages without matching, so if that's not your vibe, this probably isn't the app for you. You can even add a Fish Pic badge to your profile to show off your love of fishing and the great outdoors (if that's something you're actually into), thanks to a recent partnership with Busch Light called \"Reel Love.\" Open the app, tap the Fish Pic badge, and click \"add to profile.\"Ultimately, if a site's janky aesthetics (and sifting through a few fake profiles) don't bother you, POF offers a wide variety of potential mates. Whether you're super picky with your type or have no idea what you want, there's no way you won't come across a few people you find interesting.  The Good The Bad Details We test dating apps the way you do — by actually using them. Our team members have firsthand experience with popular apps like Tinder, Hinge, and Bumble, among other niche dating apps. For this roundup, we focused on the free versions of each app. We created new profiles, explored the interface, and tested key features like searching, matching, and messaging. We paid close attention to how easy it was to connect with others, the diversity of potential matches, and the overall user experience for people with different preferences and backgrounds.Our goal is to help you find a free dating app that allows you to meet new people and form connections without paying for a subscription, no matter your background or what you're looking for. Frequently Asked Questions Luckily, you don’t need to pay to use dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, and OkCupid. Many other apps (and old-school dating sites) are also free to download and use — paying for a subscription is completely optional. Yes, OkCupid is free to use! We chose OkCupid as the best free dating app overall because it offers free core features like sending and receiving messages, browsing potential matches, and using its detailed profile-building tools to find compatible partners. Facebook Dating, Plenty of Fish (POF), and OkCupid offer free messaging features, so you can chat and communicate with your matches without paying extra. Other free dating apps that offer messaging features include Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge. Tinder is the ultimate hookup app, and it's free to use. It doesn't shy away from its reputation as a \"hook-up\" app, and it's widely used for casual encounters. If you're a gay man, Grindr is another popular free dating app specifically designed for hookups. Looking for more options? Check out our guide to the best dating apps for casual sex and find some no-strings-attached fun. POF is a massive dating app with a familiar swipe-based system, just like Tinder. It's completely free to create a profile, browse, and match. You'll find tons of users, but be prepared for some ads and bot accounts. Bumble is a female-first dating app that flips the script by empowering women and non-binary people to make the first move. Like Tinder, it uses a swipe-based system, but after a match, only women or non-binary users can initiate the conversation. In same-sex pairings, either party can initiate the conversation.Bumble also offers features for finding friends (Bumble BFF) and networking (Bumble Bizz), making it a versatile app for building various relationships. While it's free to sign up, Bumble offers optional paid features like Bumble Boost and Bumble Premium for people who want extra perks.  Bumble can be a good option for both hookups and dating. It has a large and diverse user base, so you'll find people looking for a variety of relationships. Bumble even lets you specify your \"Dating Intentions\" in your profile, whether you're looking for something casual, a relationship, or marriage. Since women and non-binary people are required to make the first move, it can lead to more intentional connections. Ultimately, whether Bumble leads to a hookup or a relationship depends on how you use it and what you're looking for. SilverSingles is the best dating app for seniors. Although it offers several premium subscription options, you can still download and use it for free to access basic features.

Mashable has reported that \u003ca href=\"https://mashable.com/article/as-grindr-complaints-rise-gay-dating-apps-scruff-jackd-taimi-swoop-in\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\"\u003e\u003cu\u003eGrindr users\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/a\u003e are one such consumer base. Grindr has in recent years limited the visibility of \u0026#34;taps\u0026#34; (which indicate interest without a direct message), and the \u0026#34;explore\u0026#34; page (that allows users to see others not in their location) only unlocks one new profile a day, whereas it used to unlock three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere could be several reasons for this. Many mainstream apps are owned by public companies. Grindr, for example, is public, as is Match Group, the parent company behind Tinder and Hinge. When a company is beholden to shareholders, it has pressure to make more money and thus monetize features.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother reason is that companies aren\u0026#39;t immune to inflation, either. It might cost more to operate now than in years past, and they want to make up for that increased cost somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite the complaints and potential increased paywalls (and ads), these apps do function for free. But it might be like paying for the lower-tier of a streaming service: You won\u0026#39;t have all the bells and whistles.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore robust dating apps (that started as dating sites) like eharmony and Match require you to pay in order to match or chat with other users.

Men are required to pay to play, but there are usually \u003cem\u003ehuge \u003c/em\u003ediscounts (like 88% off or more) on the yearly subscription, so it\u0026#39;s still a very budget-friendly option, even for the guys.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy we picked this: \u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eHookup apps are kind of gross these days. Think really hard about apps designed \u003cem\u003esolely for hookups\u003c/em\u003e — not a pretty picture, right? Pure, on the other hand, is like Tinder’s artsy cousin who lives in Brooklyn and only comes into the City to attend niche gallery openings and off-off-Broadway plays. It’s also completely free for female users (but there’s a paid subscription called Pure Queen that has premium features like incognito mode, “smart likes,” a blocklist, and more). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePure isn’t free for everyone (men are required to pay), but we think this barrier might make it a safer place to connect with people looking for adventure. If they’re paying for it, they’ve got to be serious about what they\u0026#39;re looking for. (You can use the code \u003cstrong\u003ePUREFIRST\u003c/strong\u003e if you’re new to the app and looking for a discount.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike other dating apps, Pure is based on “ads,” which you can post to your feed. You don’t even have to include a photo if you don’t want to. (You can share up to three non-nude photos via your \u0026#34;ad.\u0026#34;) You can also add “turn-ons” to your feed to let other users know what you’re into and choose a “looking for” card to make your intentions clear from the get-go. Oh, and chats self-destruct in 24 hours, so that’s nice for the more discreet folks out there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePure also has a unique “Devil’s Bones” feature that figuratively rolls the dice and connects you with a random user. It starts with an audio chat, and if things go well, you can move to video or text chat. If you’re not into the person, just roll the dice again! And, if someone really pisses you off or pushes your boundaries, you can report and block them — Pure is big on protecting its users. \u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                        \u003cdiv @click=\"showGood=!showGood\"\u003e\n                    \u003ch3\u003eThe Good\u003c/h3\u003e\n                    \n                    \n                \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003cdiv @click=\"showBad=!showBad\"\u003e\n                    \u003ch3\u003eThe Bad\u003c/h3\u003e\n                    \n                    \n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                \u003cdiv @click=\"showDetail=!showDetail\"\u003e\n                \u003ch3\u003eDetails\u003c/h3\u003e\n                \n                \n            \u003c/div\u003e\n                    \n            \u003c/div\u003e\n\n            \n                                \u003cdiv x-data=\"{showGood:false, showBad:false, showDetail:false}\" id=\"product-055zxW24FupV21EDfdDDptj\" data-ga-module=\"roundup-product-card\" data-ga-element=\"roundup-product\"\u003e\n                    \n                \u003cdiv\u003e\n            \u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundup-products/055zxW24FupV21EDfdDDptj/product-image.fit_lpad.size_672x378.v1723189542.jpg\" alt=\"A drawn hand holding a phone with the Grindr logo\" width=\"672\" height=\"378\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\n\n\n                            \u003c/p\u003e\n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\n        \n                                    \u003cdiv\u003e\n                    \u003ch3\u003eWho it\u0026#39;s for:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://zdcs.link/z7XnV?pageview_type=Standard\u0026amp;template=roundup\u0026amp;module=content_body\u0026amp;element=offer\u0026amp;item=text-link\u0026amp;element_label=Grindr\u0026amp;object_type=roundup\u0026amp;object_uuid=01jPJXtwRdqkk4yJw3b1aGo\u0026amp;short_url=z7XnV\u0026amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Froundup%2Fbest-free-dating-sites-apps\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"\u003eGrindr\u003c/a\u003e is \u003cem\u003ethe \u003c/em\u003ehookup app for gay men and queers who can\u0026#39;t stand the heteronormativity of apps like Tinder or Bumble.
