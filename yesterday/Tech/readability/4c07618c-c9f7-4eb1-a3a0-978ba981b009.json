  "text": "It’s always a big deal for a show to (intentionally) reach its final season, and the same is true for Stranger Things. The popular sci-fi horror series has been going on for a while, and Netflix has made sure to make fans know the end is coming. Sure enough, we are nearing the finish line, as Netflix announced the fifth season has wrapped production with photos of the cast and crew on set. Additionally, co-creator Ross Duffer put out his own statement on the show’s almost eight-year lifetime. As he noted, the core Stranger Things cast were kids when they first joined, and have since become substantially older over the course of the series. “[Stranger Things] was a defining part of their childhood,” said Duffer. “They’ve grown up before our eyes, becoming more than actors—they’ve become family.” Of the crew, he said they also “hold a special place in our hearts. [Much of] our crew has been with us from the very beginning. Their dedication and passion have been the backbone of this journey. Everyone involved was determined to bring this story to a satisfying conclusion. They poured their hearts and souls into it, and we couldn’t be more proud of what they’ve accomplished.” The path to Stranger Things’ last season has been somewhat eventful: last year, production halted during the writers’ strike as Ross and Matt Duffer stopped in solidarity with their fellow writers. Things were further impacted by the actors’ strike weeks later, and once those were resolved, production spun up at the top of 2024. Between then and now, Netflix has posted set photos and provided tiiiiiiny glimpses of what’s coming. Now that production is over, it’s just a matter of waiting for Netflix to reveal the season’s release date—or dates, possibly. Want more io9 news?
