  "description": "There's a new puzzle game in town, and this one tackles remote work and corporate data manipulation. Pocket Boss is coming to Steam and the developers just dropped a trailer during the Day of the Devs showcase event, which is part of Summer Game Fest. Pocket Boss casts players as an employee working remotely, trapped by the whims of an ever-demanding boss. The game is primarily set inside of a chat window, though the puzzle element kicks in when the aforementioned job creator demands changes to data in order to maximize profits and erase competitors. When that happens, the perspective shifts to a minigame. There looks to be plenty of different designs here. One game involves flinging a competitor's market share off of the screen, while another has players navigate a physical representation of the stock market without crashing. It's like a corporation-soaked take on the WarioWare franchise. The game is published by Playables, which is the studio behind the novel-looking Time Flies and the interactive cartoon KIDS. We don't have a release date for Pocket Boss just yet. Playables Of course, this is just one game announced during the beefy Day of the Devs stream, and that's just one event of many throughout Summer Game Fest. It's a good time to be someone who likes to read and watch trailers about upcoming video games.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/pocket-boss-turns-corporate-data-manipulation-into-a-puzzle-game-000042457.html?src=rss",
