  "text": "At this price, it's truly a great deal. The AirPods Pro 2 are currently available on Amazon for an incredible price of $159, down from the list price of $249 (36% off). This deal is a record low for these very popular wireless earbuds which were priced at $189 just hours ago. Previously, the lowest price was seen during Prime Day in October at $169 but they’re usually well above $200. This current deal not only offers the best price ever but is also accessible to non-Prime members. Given the popularity of these earbuds, stock may run out quickly, so it’s wise to act fast. See at Amazon One of the great advantages of purchasing through Amazon during Black Friday is the extended return policy: you can return items purchased during this time until January 31, 2025,—far exceeding the standard 30-day return window. Why Go For The AirPods Pro 2? The AirPods Pro 2 feature advanced technology that enhances your listening experience: they’re equipped with the Apple-designed H2 chip and deliver high-fidelity sound with improved audio performance. The custom high-excursion driver and high dynamic range amplifier work together to produce richer bass and crystal-clear sound across a wide range of frequencies. The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) technology has been significantly upgraded and provides up to twice as much noise cancellation compared to the previous generation. In addition to ANC, the AirPods Pro 2 come with Adaptive Transparency mode which adjusts the level of ambient sound you hear based on your environment. This means that while you can enjoy your audio without interruption, you can still be aware of important sounds around you, such as traffic or conversations. The earbuds also include a Hearing Aid feature. The design of the AirPods Pro 2 remains sleek and comfortable and they include silicone ear tips in four sizes (XS, S, M, L) for a customizable fit. They are also sweat and water-resistant (IP54) which makes them suitable for workouts or outdoor use. With up to 6 hours of listening time on a single charge and up to 30 hours with the MagSafe Charging Case, they’re perfect for all-day use. In addition to the AirPods Pro 2, Amazon is offering massive discounts on other Apple products during this early Black Friday event. You can find great deals on the latest MacBook Air and Pro models, Mac Minis, iPads and iPad Minis as well as AirPods Max. Apple typically does not offer direct promotions in its own stores; therefore, shopping through authorized retailers like Amazon is essential for accessing these discounts. See at Amazon",
