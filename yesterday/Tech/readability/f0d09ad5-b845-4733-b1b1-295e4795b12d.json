  "text": "Andrew Liszewski is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.After months of remaining quiet about how President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Chinese-made goods may affect its business, Nikon has announced a “necessary price adjustment” for its products that will come into effect for the US starting on June 23rd, 2025. The company hasn’t shared any specifics on which of its imaging products will see a price increase, or how much the increases may end up being, but it could mean this is the time to grab hardware like the recent Z5 II if you’ve been eyeing it. “At Nikon, we remain committed to providing the highest quality imaging products and value to our customers,” Nikon said in a statement posted Friday. “Due to the recent tariffs, a necessary price adjustment for products will take effect on June 23, 2025. We will be carefully monitoring any tariff developments and may adjust pricing as necessary to reflect the evolving market conditions. We wish to thank our customers for their understanding and know that we are taking every possible step to minimize the impact on our community.”Earlier this month, during a presentation where the company shared its latest financial results, Nikon said (pdf) the tariffs could reduce its profits for the upcoming fiscal year by 10 billion yen, or around $70 million, as reported by PetaPixel.Nikon is not the first or only camera gear company to announce price increases as a result of the US tariffs. The Australia-based Blackmagic Design started charging more for its digital cinema cameras last month while also announcing that the tariffs made its plans to build a factory in Dallas, Texas, financially unviable.During the announcement for its own Q1 financial results in late April, Canon told analysts that it was planning to raise prices and was “in the process of estimating the timing and amount of the increase,” according to DPReview. The company also said its price increases would be limited to the US, but that could change if the tariffs triggered a wider global recession.Other camera makers that have recently raised prices include Sony and Leica, while Fujifilm temporarily paused US preorders for several of its cameras, including the budget-friendly X-M5 and the still popular X100VI, the company told DPReview in late April. Lens maker Sigma has also announced pricing adjustments, but like Nikon, those aren’t going into effect immediately and will instead start on June 2nd, 2025.",
