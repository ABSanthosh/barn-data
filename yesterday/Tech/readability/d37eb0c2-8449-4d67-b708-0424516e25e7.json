Read Full Bio  on May 1, 2025 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Flipboard The author was recreated with the help of an actress and artificial intelligence. (AI-generated image) Credit: BBC Maestro On Wednesday, BBC Maestro — a similar service to Masterclass — launched a new writing course taught by the best-selling novelist of all time. There’s a catch: the author, genre-defining mystery writer Agatha Christie, died 50 years ago, and was thus unavailable to participate.Instead, BBC Maestro used an actress and artificial intelligence to recreate Christie, drawing from the author’s own novels, interviews, and letters for the course material. The creators describe the effort as a “world-first,” and the “Agatha Christie On Writing” masterclass is available now.Almost as soon as the course launched, critics accused the BBC of making an Agatha Christie “deepfake.” Meanwhile, BBC Maestro wants to emphasize the participation of the Christie estate and their high esteem for the late author.“This groundbreaking course was carefully created over two years by a team of almost 100 people, including academics, researchers, creative professionals, and a team of leading global Agatha Christie scholars, who have each studied Agatha’s written and spoken words and who curated the course to reflect all her teachings,” an announcement reads.  The Agatha Christie writing course is available now. Credit: Screenshot courtesy of BBC Maestro Is the Agatha Christie writing course inspired or unsettling?The BBC Maestro says viewers and aspiring writers can learn \"the art of suspense, plot twists, and unforgettable characters\" from Christie herself, yet many creatives are extremely wary of applying artificial intelligence to the arts — no matter what.Whether the course qualifies as a deepfake depends on how you define deepfake. A 2024 article from BBC Newsround defines deepfakes as “videos, picture or audio clips made with artificial intelligence to look real. They can be used for fun, or even for scientific research, but sometimes they're used to impersonate people like politicians or world leaders, in order to deliberately mislead people.” The term is most often used with negative connotations to refer to AI-generated content created without consent. Just this week in the United States, congress passed the “Take It Down” Act to prevent deepfakes and revenge porn from spreading online. Mashable Light Speed Obviously, Christie can’t personally consent to her likeness and voice being used to sell writing courses, but the Christie estate was involved in this project from its inception. The BBC worked closely with Christie’s great-grandson James Prichard, who manages the author’s estate.Certainly, the BBC knew this project would be controversial, and both Prichard and BBC Maestro reject the use of the term “deepfake” in this context. In a statement provided to Mashable, Prichard, the Chairman and CEO of Agatha Christie Ltd., said, “What we have created is a course that distills my great-grandmother’s ingenious craft into an easy to follow and accessible course. This isn’t a fake. The words are Christie’s own, carefully sourced by researchers. As a family, we approached the project with the utmost care and respect with the overarching goal of honouring my great-grandmother and to share her immense talent and process with the world.”Both Prichard and BBC Maestro are keen to emphasize that Christie’s likeness was lovingly rendered, despite the controversial nature of AI resurrection projects like this.In answer to our questions, BBC Maestro CEO Michael Levine told us that the term “deepfake” most commonly refers to material made “without permission” and “often for malicious purpose.” “That is absolutely not what we’re doing,” Levine said in an email statement to Mashable. “Every step was guided by ethics, transparency, and a deep respect for her legacy.”Levine also emphasized the involvement of Christie’s own estate and leading scholars of her work.“From the outset, our focus was on being 100% ethical and respectful in honouring Agatha Christie's remarkable legacy. We worked hand-in-hand with the Christie Estate to ensure her image is used only with their express approval and in a way that reflects her values. We collaborated with four world-leading Agatha Christie scholars who developed the script using her own words and writings. An actor then performed the role with full awareness of how the material would be used — exclusively in the context of this programme.\"The team took great care over two years to represent Christie as realistically as possible, yet AI skeptics condemned the entire project immediately.Whether you think this is an exciting opportunity to “learn directly from the most successful novelist of all time” or a grotesque application of AI technology, BBC Maestro is absolutely correct to call the course “groundbreaking.”  Timothy Beck Werth is the Tech Editor at Mashable, where he leads coverage and assignments for the Tech and Shopping verticals.
