Credit: Ricky Carioti / Pool / Getty Images Meta is reportedly planning to spin off Meta AI into a standalone app to compete with ChatGPT. OpenAI's Sam Altman immediately responded with a heavy dose of snark.According to CNBC, Meta plans to make Meta AI — which currently exists as a tool embedded within Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp — into its own app in the second quarter of this year. This is all part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's ambition to make Meta AI the go-to AI assistant, aiming to take on competitors like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and xAI's Grok. \"This is going to be the year when a highly intelligent and personalized AI assistant reaches more than 1 billion people, and I expect Meta AI to be that leading AI assistant,\" said Zuckerberg in a fourth quarter earnings call in January. In order to do that, Meta has a steep hill to climb. The world hasn't embraced Meta AI as enthusiastically as ChatGPT, which became the fastest growing app of all time shortly after its launch. When Meta hard-launched Meta AI by making it the default search bar on Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, people hated it and soon discovered you can't turn it off. That, plus the fact that it's integrated within Meta's apps, might skew data on use and engagement. Meta CFO Susan Li said in the January earnings call that Meta AI has \"more than 700 million monthly actives,\" but that could be because it's part of the existing apps, and again, cannot be turned off. Mashable Light Speed By comparison, ChatGPT has over 300 million weekly active users. Altman took notice of the CNBC story and seemed skeptical about Meta AI's ambitious plans. \"Ok fine maybe we'll do a social app,\" he said on X, reposting the CNBC article. Tweet may have been deleted Altman added in another somewhat snarky comment, \"lol if [F]acebook tries to come at us and we just uno reverse them it would be so funny.\" Altman is referencing the Uno game card and meme that effectively boils down to beating someone at their own game.Zuckerberg appears to see Meta AI as the company's golden goose for increasing engagement and monetizing its apps. But it has bungled past efforts to meaningfully engage with users. There was the whole confusing celebrity AI avatars, which was axed after less than a year after failing to gain traction. And then there were the made-up AI characters like Liv the \"proud Black queer momma of 2 \u0026 truth-teller,\" that was annihilated for being \"digital blackface\" and has since been shut down. On top of that, Meta has made it near impossible to opt out of scraping user data to train Meta AI, which isn't great for fostering trust. That said, Google has similar data gathering practices for Gemini, so maybe it won't be a deal breaker for Meta users. Your move, Zuck. Hope you know how to play Uno.
