  "text": "Two years ago, the minds behind Testing for All — a Covid-era at-home testing service — launched a new startup. But instead of those dreaded antigen tests that make you feel like you’re trying to tickle your brain with a cotton swab, the company delivers something much more comforting: a trained nurse or doctor.  The London-based venture is called Heim Health. It works with the private sector and the NHS to match patients with the best practitioners in their area. Once paired, the platform uses algorithms borrowed from delivery apps to map the fastest routes and schedule the most convenient time for the appointment. Less time wasted in traffic means more patients seen per shift. And Heim even ensures any necessary equipment shows up before your nurse does.  “Specialist care is becoming increasingly bottlenecked, with waiting lists at an all-time high and discharge delays keeping patients in hospital longer than they need,” said Kelly Klifa, co-founder and CEO at Heim Health, and former founder of Testing for All (pictured top left).  “Our mission with Heim Health is to build the digital infrastructure needed to change this; revitalising community-based care and moving more healthcare from the hospital into the home through scalable modes of delivery.” During the height of the pandemic, Klifa launched Testing for All alongside James Monico. It was the UK’s only not-for-profit Covid testing service, delivering more than 1 million at-home tests. In 2022, the pair teamed up with entrepreneur Sasha Tory (pictured top right) to expand the concept to at-home healthcare.   Today, Heim Health announced it has raised £2.2mn (€2.5m) in seed funding. The round was led by Heal Capital and joined by Form Ventures, Portfolio Ventures and Houghton Street Ventures.  This fresh capital will help Heim Health to fine-tune its algorithms and support a wider range of healthcare services, including furthering its work with the NHS. The company said its long-term mission is to ease pressure on hospitals and provide patients with better care.   Heim is already getting good feedback, it said. According to the company, healthcare providers have seen patient waiting slashed up to 85% by using the platform.  Get the TNW newsletter Get the most important tech news in your inbox each week.
