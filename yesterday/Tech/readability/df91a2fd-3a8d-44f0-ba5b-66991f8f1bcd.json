The future of deep tech In an exclusive session titled Gods of Industry: The Battle for Deep Tech Dominance, Wennink will take the stage alongside Young Sohn, another digital visionary. Formerly the President and Chief Strategy Officer of Samsung Electronic, Sohn is now the founding managing partner at Walden Catalyst Ventures, a VC fund dedicated to deep tech. Together, the duo will unpack the next decade of innovations. Their insights will shine a light on the next era of tech leaders. During Wennink‚Äôs tenure, ASML became one of these leaders. The company‚Äôs machines still produce the chips for all kinds of advanced device, from iPhones to self-driving cars. ASML has also supported the broader deep tech ecosystem. The firm backed DeepTechXL, a Dutch fund that last year raised ‚Ç¨110mn, and was deeply involved in Brainport Eindhoven, which Wennink calls ‚Äúprobably unique‚Äù in the world of deep tech. Since retiring from ASML last year, Wennink has remained a key figure in the field. He believes the next wave of deep tech will unlock possibilities that are hard to imagine. They may require challenging paths from lab to market, deep domain expertise, and patient capital ‚Äî but the payoffs will be truly transformative.
