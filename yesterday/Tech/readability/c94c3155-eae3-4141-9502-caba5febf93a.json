I don't care at all if it's all a scheme to get my data—my data is out there, baby, and it's too late to care, so I might as well reap all the benefits these flash-in-the-pan, VC-bolstering programs can give me. Most of the time, I don't get much. But sometimes, I get free stuff! I love trading my data and my finite time on this earth for meager rewards. If you do too, here are eight apps I use all the time to get free stuff, from food to more tangible goods.The best apps to get free food or drinksDunkin' My beloved app greets my by name each morning. Credit: Lindsey Ellefson As I've noted before, but the Dunkin' app is elite when it comes to rewarding customers for spending money on donuts and coffee. If you play it right, you can get all kinds of treats for free. Yes, you have to spend money to earn money, but if you're already going to Dunkin', that doesn't really matter. For every dollar you spend, you get 10 rewards points, but if you visit 12 times in a month and hit \"boosted\" status, each dollar you spend until the end of the month earns you 12 points. Points add up quickly, and you don't need all that many to score something free: You can get an espresso shot for 150, a donut for 250, a hot or iced coffee of any size for 500, and so on. There are also point-enhancing promotions going on all the time. Sometimes, you get bonus points for ordering a certain snack or visiting at a certain time. On Mondays, you get 100 points just for placing a mobile order. Soon enough, you'll rolling in free munchkins.McDonald's In the food and drink sphere, I have a membership and associated app at pretty much every restaurant chain. McDonald's is among the best. The app is fabulous because it's constantly running promotions where you can get a free something-or-other, usually for doing nothing but using the app to place your order. On days when I'm feeling frugal but not particularly health-conscious, you'll catch me mobile-ordering my way to a medium fry and a big Diet Coke—and the fries are free as long as I spend a minimum of $1, which is about what the drink costs.Right now, the app is offering up a free double cheeseburger or six-piece McNuggets when you buy one. I also have enough points for two McChickens or a large iced coffee. Every dollar you spend earns you 100 points, but as with the Dunkin' app, you also get bonus points for fulfilling certain stipulations, like double points on breakfast orders. The first time you pay through the app with your linked card, you'll also get 1,500 points, which is enough for a cheeseburger.7-Eleven Look at all my options. Credit: Lindsey Ellefson 7-Eleven has a severely underrated rewards app. I usually get a dollar or so off my purchases every other visit, and since most of the goods available at this convenience store are themselves just a few dollars, that basically means I'm getting free Doritos or Vitamin Waters every week. Every dollar you spend gets you 10 points (unless you're spending on age-restricted items or gas), plus you can earn extra points for daily promotions like buying two of a certain item. Once you get 1,000 points, you have $1 to spend. A dollar off for every $100 spent isn't great, but if you take advantage of those random weekly specials, you can score a lot of bonus points.Seated For a slightly different spin on getting free stuff from a food app, try Seated, which I've also evangelized for before. What sets it apart from other restaurant-affiliated apps is that the free things you get for using it don't come from the restaurants themselves. Instead, you get a percentage of your money back every time you use the app to make a reservation and eat a meal, which you can then spend on gift cards for businesses like Uber, Amazon, and TJMaxx—or just have it deposited back into your checking account as cash. Again, you're spending money to make money, but it's better than getting nothing if you're spending anyway. I have gotten hundreds of dollars back from Seated and turned that into hundreds of dollars worth of free stuff. Seated has an involved, useful interface. Credit: Lindsey Ellefson Claim This week, I was served up an ad for Claim, an app with the tagline \"get paid to eat and shop.\" Buddy, you do not have to tell me twice. After linking a debit card and my Venmo account, I got to work figuring out how to earn my free stuff. The gist is that once per week, you can choose a restaurant or retail establishment from a pre-selected list and stake a \"claim\" on it. This means that if and when you spend money at that spot during that week using your linked card, you get $10 sent to your Venmo account. To test it out, I got a claim for Wingstop, which happens to be across the street from the post office where I ship out my Poshmark sales. I took a walk, dropped off my sales for the day, then ordered a six-piece wing box. By the time I got home and tucked into the chicken, $10 had appeared in my Venmo account. I would have had to stop and eat that day anyway, so this was free money. While you can only select and use one claim per week, you can earn additional claims by inviting friends to the app. You pick the establishment you want a claim for—right now, choices include Starbucks, Chipotle, Blue Bottle Coffee, Dunkin', and more—and the place you want your friend to get their free claim for. Once they use your referral and link a card to the app, you both get a bonus claim. BBHMM. Credit: Lindsey Ellefson The best apps to get free stuffInfluenster The original app that helped me when I was too broke for good makeup a decade ago. Credit: Lindsey Ellefson I'm way into makeup and personal care items and I'm always looking for ways to get my hands on more. Years ago, I downloaded Influenster, an app that promised free samples in exchange for a little effort on my part in the form of reviewing products within the app. After earning up some cred within the app, I started getting free stuff sent to me, with the caveat that I would thoughtfully review it. There were other tasks I could complete, like creating public Instagram posts about products, but I declined—that's not my style. Even without completing those challenges, I have gotten a ton of free stuff. I even secured a few lipsticks from Revlon that I ended up liking so much I've consistently repurchased them in the years since 2017. Great app. Iris I am earning gems at a rate you wouldn't believe. Credit: Lindsey Ellefson Lately, I've gotten very into Iris, which is basically a new spin on Influenster. You earn \"gems\" by reviewing products, posting in discussions, and generally interacting with the community, which is comprised of people interested in beauty and skincare. These gems can be used on \"drops,\" or limited-time offers of products you can get sent to you free, but which you must then review. The drops you're eligible for depend on your level within the app, with the quality scaling up as you climb the latter. What do you think so far? Drops are quite limited: One may only have a few pieces available, so you have to order it the second it hits your phone, unless you're saving your gems for something major. Right now, I'm entertaining the delusion that I'll earn 45,000 gems fast enough to snag the final remaining Dyson Airstraight, a hair tool that costs $500 in the real world. The nice thing about Iris is that you can't use real money to buy gems or expedite your progress. You really do have to do it all on your own, and you'll pay nothing out of pocket.A few months ago, I used my gems on a travel-sized bottle of Glossier perfume, which saved me about $40. I didn't have to wait long, the package came straight from Glossier as if I'd ordered from the company directly, and all I had to do was write a review the next week. Goss Goss is similar in terms to Iris in terms of possible rewards, but your earn them very differently. The best way I can describe it is like sports betting, but for pop culture. By using in-game currency to place bets on things like how many likes a celebrity's Instagram post will have within 24 hours or who will be voted off a reality show during its next episode, you'll acquire a different in-game currency that can be traded for real-life products. After a few (very fun) weeks of betting a while back, I earned enough to get a Summer Fridays lip balm. Could I go to Sephora right now and buy one for $24? Absolutely I could. Is it more fun to answer questions, place bets, and gamify the whole ordeal? Absolutely it is. You can buy in-game currency with real-world money, which sets this one apart from Influenster and Iris, but you don't have to. By completing arbitrary challenges like logging in every day or placing certain types of bets, you can quickly rack up enough credits to paste bets consistently, without spending a dime. You also get rewards by inviting friends with your referral code. Now the bad news: The app is down for scheduled maintenance as of this writing, and won't be back until August. I've been missing it since it disappeared a few weeks ago, and am eagerly awaiting its return so I can use my accured in-game currency to buy some self-tanner and a tote bag. Yes, I know nothing is really freeWhat's that phrase?\"If it's free, you're the product?\" Well, yes. All of these apps require me to give companies access to my data, from my interests to my shopping habits. I'm also racking up time playing games, writing reviews, or even spending money to earn some of it back. I understand that, but in these instances, it's a trade I'm willing to make.By choosing apps that line up with the things you'd already be doing or spending money on—in my case: buying makeup, walking to Dunkin' twice a day, and wasting time on my phone—you can earn free rewards, and make the most of your routines and idle time. Life can be a downer, so I might as well find ways to turn a mundane task into free perfume.

A dollar off for every $100 spent isn\u0026#39;t great, but if you take advantage of those random weekly specials, you can score a lot of bonus points.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSeated \u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor a slightly different spin on getting free stuff from a food app, try \u003ca data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-template=\"Opinions\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\" data-ga-element=\"offer\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-event_label=\"Seated\" href=\"https://zdcs.link/V0nlg?pageview_type=Standard\u0026amp;template=Opinions\u0026amp;module=content_body\u0026amp;element=offer\u0026amp;item=text-link\u0026amp;element_label=Seated\u0026amp;short_url=V0nlg\u0026amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Fthe-best-apps-for-getting-free-stuff\u0026amp;event_label=Seated\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eSeated\u003c/a\u003e, which I\u0026#39;ve also \u003ca href=\"https://lifehacker.com/tech/seated-app-pays-you-to-go-out-to-eat\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eevangelized for before\u003c/a\u003e.
