Credit: Khamosh Pathak Some software updates pack in a number of features and changes, while others fundamentally overhaul the experience of using the device in question. iOS 18.5 is neither: This is a minor update, but that's to be expected. WWDC is next month, where Apple will almost assuredly announce iOS 19.But iOS 18.5 isn't an empty update. Once you install it on your iPhone, you will notice some changes—and some of the changes you don't notice are the most important of all. Here's everything that's new in the latest iOS update:With iOS 18.2, Apple upgraded the Mail app. For some, the changes made the Mail app more organized and efficient to use. For others, it was bloated and confusing. Contact photos didn't help. The idea is that if you have a contact photo for a sender, it'll appear in the left side of the message in your inbox. However, if you don't have such a photo, Mail will use an image from Apple's stock library. Taste is subjective, but, frankly, these stock icons just don't look good. Luckily, you can disable them, but you'd never know that unless you're someone who loves diving through your Settings app. iOS 18.5 fixes that with an easy option right in the Mail app itself. Lifehacker's Khamosh Pathak explained the change in more depth here. It just got more difficult to bypass Screen Time settingsApple's Screen Time feature is a great tool for parents—and, I can only image, a pain for kids. Parents can set a passcode to lock Screen Time settings, and ensure that kids can't access aspects of their iPhone their parents don't want them to. Of course, passcodes are an infamously futile restriction, as savvy kids will always figure out how to break in. While Apple's isn't reinventing the passcode wheel with iOS 18.5, it is making Screen Time a bit more secure. Once you update, you'll receive a notification whenever the Screen Time passcode is used on a child's device. That won't stop your kids from figuring out your Screen Time passcode, but it will nip their fun in the bud pretty quickly.I imagine the kids will figure out some workaround to this feature in the future. But, for now, you have an additional tool to help ensure the restrictions stay in place. A new \"Pride Harmony\" wallpaper Credit: Apple In anticipation of Pride Month, Apple is rolling out a new \"Pride Harmony\" wallpaper for its various devices. The wallpaper features colors of the rainbow that adjust their positions as you move, lock, or unlock your iPhone or iPad. Apple also has a new Pride Edition Sport Band, which features a similar color scheme. Apple says its goal with the Pride Harmony design is to \"celebrate the strength and beauty of LGBTQ+ communities around the world.\" It's easy to be cynical about corporate pride, but considering the times we live in, it's cool to see Apple continuing to be as openly supportive of the LGBTQ+ community as it has been in recent years. (Tim Cook's donations aside.)\"Buy with iPhone\" now available on third-party devicesWhen you buy something on the Apple TV's TV app (say that three times fast), you have the option to approve that purchase with your iPhone. With iOS 18.5, that feature is coming to the TV app on non-Apple devices. That way, you don't need to make the purchase on the TV app of another Apple device before being able to watch on your third-party device. What do you think so far? Carrier-provided satellite features are now available on the iPhone 13 seriesSince 2023, Apple has officially supported satellite communications for all iPhones starting with the 14 series. If you're out without cell services, you can connect to a satellite to reach out to the authorities for help—or even just text a friend. Following this latest update, however, iPhone 13 users will be able to take advantage of satellite features as well. Apple Vision Pro app gets a bug fixThe update also fixes an issue with the Apple Vision Pro app, where the app may sometimes display a black screen. Security updatesiOS 18.5's sleeper feature is the security boost it provides your iPhone. In all, the update patches over 30 bugs. Luckily, Apple isn't aware of any exploits for these vulnerabilities, which means hackers have likely not used these flaws to target iPhone users. That said, the safest course of action is to update your iPhone as soon as possible, in case someone does figure out how to use these flaws against you. Plus, there are some non-hacking vulnerabilities here you should patch. FaceTime's mute button, for example, might not actually work, which should be more than enough reason to update to iOS 18.5. (Be careful when talking smack while on a FaceTime call.)You can see the full list of updates here. Jake Peterson Senior Technology Editor Jake Peterson is Lifehacker’s Senior Technology Editor.
