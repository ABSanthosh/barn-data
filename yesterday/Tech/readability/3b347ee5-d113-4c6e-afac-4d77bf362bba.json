Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.MSI has revealed its latest iteration of its Claw PC gaming handheld — and this time, it’s powered by AMD. The company showed off the Claw A8 BZ2EM at Computex 2025, which comes with an AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip along with up to 24GB of DDR5 memory.That’s a bit less than the 32GB of memory that came with the Intel-equipped Claw 8 AI Plus released late last year, but it still has an 8-inch full HD display, a 120Hz refresh rate, and a 1TB M.2 SSD. The AMD-powered Claw A8 will also come in two colors: white and lime green.MSI had a bit of a rough start with the release of its original Claw handheld in March 2024, but it seemed to redeem itself with the launch of the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus. Lenovo also snapped up one of AMD’s new handheld-focused chips for the Legion Go S, but it uses the weaker Z2 Go version that my colleague Sean Hollister said “can’t compete” with its predecessor’s Z1 Extreme.There’s a new MSI Claw 8 AI Plus “Polar Tempest” edition, too, which features an up to Intel Core Ultra 7 258V processor and a 2TB NVMe SSD. It also has what MSI calls a “glittering” white coating. MSI didn’t reveal a release date or price for either model, but it will likely be in the same ballpark as the standard Intel-powered MSI Claw 8 Plus, which Best Buy lists as costing $999.99.",
