  "description": "Comcast is introducing new simplified, contract-free broadband plans that eliminate its unpopular 1.2TB data cap for residential customers. \"The company began enforcing a data cap in 2008, when it set that limit at 250GB,\" notes PCMag. \"Four years later, it raised that to 300GB, then lifted it to 1TB in 2016 and inched it up again to 1.25TB in 2020 after suspending it entirely during the early months of the pandemic.\" The report notes that existing customers will need to switch to these updated plans to benefit from the cap removal. PCMag reports: Steve Croney, Comcast's COO for connectivity and platforms, describes these new \"everyday price plans\" as \"built on simplicity and transparency -- no hidden fees, no confusion.\" Comcast began showing the new plans on its sign-up pages Thursday morning. The monthly rates largely match those announced when Comcast advertised a rate-lock offer in April: - 300Mbps downloads for $40 with a one-year lock or $55 with a five-year lock, then $70 a month - 500Mbps for $55 with a one-year lock or $70 with a five-year lock, then $85 - 1Gbps for $70 with a one-year lock or $85 a month with a five-year lock, then $100 - 2Gbps for $100 with a one-year lock or $115 with a five-year lock, then $130 Upload speeds on those plans will vary by location but should start at 40Mbps. These plans also include one year of Xfinity Mobile wireless service, which combines Verizon's coverage with Comcast's Wi-Fi network. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
