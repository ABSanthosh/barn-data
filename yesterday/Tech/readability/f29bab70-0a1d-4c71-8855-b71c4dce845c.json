  "description": "Senators Tim Sheehy and Elizabeth Warren have introduced the bipartisan \"Warrior Right to Repair Act,\" which would guarantee the military's right to repair its own equipment. The bill builds on a previous Army directive and has broad public support, with nearly 75% of Americans in favor, according to a PIRG poll. Engadget reports: The Department of Defense has not been immune from restrictive practices set forth by manufacturers, and much like the average consumer, has been hamstrung in its ability to repair its own equipment by clauses in its purchase agreements. According to the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), the current system leads to excessive repair and sustainment costs, and can even impede military readiness. \"When our neighbors, friends and family serve in our military, we expect them to get what they need to do their jobs as safely as possible,\" PIRG Federal Legislative Director Isaac Bowers wrote regarding the newly introduced bill. \"Somehow, that hasn't included the materials and information they need to repair equipment they rely on. It's time we fixed that.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
