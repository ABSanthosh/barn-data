The tool allows users to search for content using numerous other search queries, such as mood. Being that the feature is powered by OpenAI, it appears likely that users will be able to use natural language in their search.Artificial intelligence isn't completely new to Netflix. The streaming company utilizes AI to power its recommendation algorithm, to help subscribers discover content based on their viewing history.

It's currently only available on iOS devices and to some customers in Australia and New Zealand. In addition, those subscribers need to specifically opt-in to use the tool.Netflix expects to expand the test out to other countries, including the U.S., in the near future.",
