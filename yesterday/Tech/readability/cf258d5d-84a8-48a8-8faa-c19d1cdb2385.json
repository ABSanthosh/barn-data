  "text": "Even though Andrew Garfield was in Spider-Man: No Way Home, he was forced to deny it. That’s why he knows saying he’s not in the upcoming sequel, out in 2026, really doesn’t hold much weight. “I’m gonna disappoint you,” Garfield told GQ when asked if he’d signed on for the upcoming fourth Tom Holland Spider-Man. “Yeah, no. But I know no one’s gonna trust anything I say from now on.” That odd choice of words brings us right back to 2021, one of the many times Garfield was asked about appearing in No Way Home. “Listen, I can’t speak for anyone else but myself,” the actor said at the time. “They might be doing something, but I ain’t got a call.” Of course, we now know Garfield not only did get a call, he played a major role in the movie. It just happened to be so secretive, he was forced to lie to protect the secret. This time though, we think his statement has a bit more authority. Very little is known officially about the sequel outside of its release date (July 24, 2026), its director (Destin Daniel Cretton), and its stars (Tom Holland and Zendaya, to start). Producer Amy Pascal also confirmed it’ll continue the story from the end of the last film where Peter Parker (Holland) made the whole world forget about him in order to save it. So, we assume, we’ll pick up with Peter Parker, still as Spider-Man, in a world where no one knows who Peter Parker is, or that he’s Spider-Man. Which is a very blank slate. Could that story stay grounded in or around New York City? Of course. Could it be another huge multiversal adventure? Absolutely. And if it’s the latter, could that mean this Peter Parker reunites with his multiversal friends, Peter Two (Tobey Maguire) and Peter Three (Garfield)? Sure. But we just have a feeling, when that happens—not if, but when—it’ll be a little later down the line. Like maybe in Avengers: Secret Wars, which comes out the following summer. And whether it happens or not, Garfield won’t be able to say. Want more io9 news?
