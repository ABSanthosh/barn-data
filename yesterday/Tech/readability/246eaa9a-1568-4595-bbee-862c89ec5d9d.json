  "text": "The ragtag ne’er-do-wells are back in action, for better and worse, in Marvel’s latest look at Thunderbolts*—featuring a team-up of second banana characters finally getting to cut loose in their own film. These anti-heroes may not be Avenger-level, but the actors playing them are certainly A-list, including Florence Pugh (as Yelena Belova, seen in Black Widow and Hawkeye), Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes (aka the Winter Soldier, of Captain America-adjacent fame), and David Harbour (as the Red Guardian, back for more reluctant action after Black Widow). Here’s the new trailer for Thunderbolts*: Other familiar faces in the cast include Wyatt Russell as John Walker/U.S. Agent (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier); Olga Kurylenko as Antonia Dreykov/Taskmaster (Black Widow); Hannah John-Kamen as Ava Starr/Ghost (Ant-Man and the Wasp); and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Black Widow, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever). Also along for the ride: Lewis Pullman, Geraldine Viswanathan, Chris Bauer, and Wendell Pierce, with probably more cameos (Laurence Fishburne? Rachel Weisz? Harrison Ford?) and surprises sprinkled in as well. We’ll follow these heavily armed rogues and weirdos on what look to be some very wild government missions when Thunderbolts*, directed by Jake Schreier (Robot \u0026 Frank, Beef, Star Wars: Skeleton Crew), closes out the MCU’s Phase Five on May 2.
