The trailer for Invincible Season 3 is jam-packed with superhero mayhem.For starters, Mark Grayson (voiced by Steven Yeun) is on a major training kick. His speed has increased 65 percent, his endurance has increased 75 percent, and his strength is up a whopping 135 percent. Plus, he's got a new, more \"serious\" dark blue suit. With all these upgrades, he'll be ready to take down any Viltrumites — including his father Omni-Man (voiced by J.K. Simmons). Right? Well, looks like he'll have to deal with more problems on the home front first. His half-brother Oliver (voiced by Lincoln Bodin) has taken up the title of Kid Omni-Man, which comes with just the tiniest bit of baggage. Meanwhile, Mark keeps butting heads with Global Defense Agency Director Cecil Stedman (voiced by Fallout's Walton Goggins) over how Cecil plants to protect Earth.\"We can be the good guys, or we can be the guys that save the world,\" Cecil tells Mark. \"We can't be both.\"As if the morally dubious compromises weren't enough, Cecil then ambushes Mark in the White Room, a place specifically meant to protect Cecil from Mark. I don't know Stedman, that doesn't seem like the best way to keep Mark's trust! No wonder he goes rogue at the end of the trailer. But what in the world will he do next?The first three episodes of Invincible Season 3 premiere Feb. 6 on Prime Video, with new episodes weekly. Belen Edwards is an Entertainment Reporter at Mashable.
