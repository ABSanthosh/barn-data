  "text": "‚ÄúI want to continue Stark‚Äôs legacy,‚Äù says Riri Williams, the main character in the upcoming Marvel Studios show¬†Ironheart. Played by Dominique Thorne, Riri is a genius inventor, just like the late, great Iron Man, but without his billionaire resources. That conflict will be at the heart of the new show, which debuts on Disney+ June 24, and Tony Stark himself just endorsed it. Two fantastic Ironheart videos just came online, one of which focuses on the practical suits built for the production. Executive producer Ryan Coogler, who introduced Riri in his film¬†Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, chimes in along with other members of the creative team. Here‚Äôs where we get to see Riri really try and be the MCU‚Äôs next Tony Stark. Gear up for a behind-the-scenes look at how Riri‚Äôs suit came to life‚Äîstraight from the filmmakers and special effects team behind Marvel Television‚Äôs #Ironheart.

He‚Äôs Doctor Doom. Robert Downey Jr. is currently in London filming Avengers: Doomsday, where he plays the titular villain, and the actor chimed in from the set to give his approval to Ironheart during an interview with Good Morning America. The full interview is below, but we‚Äôve cued it right up to Downey‚Äôs bit. Now, it‚Äôs quite clear Downey is reading a pre-written statement there, and to some, that might make it seem forced. But he didn‚Äôt have to read or record anything at all. If this were a political campaign, Ironheart getting the official backing of the Godfather of the MCU like this would be a big deal. And we still think it‚Äôs at least a medium-sized deal, just because who better to know stories of geniuses in super suits than Robert Downey Jr.? Ironheart debuts June 24 and is one of only a handful of Marvel Studios shows coming to Disney+ in the next year or so. After this, there‚Äôs the animated Eyes of Wakanda and Marvel Zombies, followed by Wonder Man in December, season two of Daredevil Born Again, probably sometime next year, and, finally, the Vision show. Will Ironheart be the best of the bunch? What kind of impact, if any, will it have on the MCU? We‚Äôll find out soon. Here‚Äôs a look at the episode titles: Riri‚Äôs notebook = unlocked. üîì Check out the official #Ironheart episode guide and stream on @DisneyPlus starting June 24. pic.twitter.com/cIJrILXbAi ‚Äî Marvel Studios (@MarvelStudios) June 17, 2025 Want more io9 news?
