He joined The Verge in 2021 after several years covering news at Engadget.Starlink users reported they couldn’t connect to SpaceX’s satellite internet service for a few hours on Thursday afternoon before service was eventually restored. Widespread Starlink outages, like the ones we reported on in 2022 and 2023, have been rare, and this appears to be the first one in 2025.The outage began around 3:15PM ET or so, with users receiving error messages saying there is “no healthy upstream.” Starlink posted a message on X at 4:05PM ET: “Starlink is currently in a network outage and we are actively implementing a solution. We appreciate your patience, we’ll share an update once this issue is resolved.”At 6:23PM ET, Starlink engineering VP Michael Nicolls followed that up with a message saying that after a 2.5-hour outage, the network has “mostly recovered.” “The outage was due to failure of key internal software services that operate the core network,” writes Nicolls, without going into specific detail.According to The Kyiv Independent, the outage affected Ukrainian troops who rely on Starlink terminals, citing a Telegram message from the military saying Starlink is down across the entire front. The military now says its connections are back online after going down for about 150 minutes, “the longest in the war.”T-Mobile just opened its Starlink-powered T-Satellite messaging service to everyone yesterday, but we haven’t seen any updates on its status. During the outage, the global connectivity trackers at NetBlocks reported that overall Starlink connectivity dropped to “16 percent of ordinary levels.”Update, July 24th: Added information from the Ukrainian military and NetBlocks, and updated to note that service has been restored.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Richard Lawler",
