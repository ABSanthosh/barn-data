  "description": "\"More than a decade after the advent of the 3D-printed gun as an icon of libertarianism and a gun control nightmare, police say one of those homemade plastic weapons has now been found in the hands of perhaps the world's most high-profile alleged killer,\" Wired wrote this month: For the community of DIY gunsmiths who have spent years honing those printable firearm models, in fact, the handgun police claim Luigi Mangione used to fatally shoot UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson is as recognizable as the now-famous alleged shooter himself — and shows just how practical and lethal those weapons have become. In the 24 hours since police released a photo of what they say is Mangione's gun following the 26-year-old's arrest Monday, the online community devoted to 3D-printed firearms has been quick to identify the suspected murder weapon as a particular model of printable \"ghost gun\" — a homemade weapon with no serial number, created by assembling a mix of commercial and DIY parts. The gun appears to be a Chairmanwon V1, a tweak of a popular partially 3D-printed Glock-style design known as the FMDA 19.2 — an acronym that stands for the libertarian slogan \"Free Men Don't Ask.\" The FMDA 19.2, released in 2021, is a relatively old model by 3D-printed-gun standards, says one gunsmith who goes by the first name John and the online handle Mr. Snow Makes... Despite its simple description by law enforcement and others as a \"3D-printed pistol,\" the FMDA 19.2 is only partially 3D printed. That makes it fundamentally different from fully 3D-printed guns like the \"Liberator,\" the original one-shot, 3D-printed pistol Wilson debuted in 2013. Instead, firearms built from designs like the FMDA 19.2 are assembled from a combination of commercially produced parts like barrels, slides, and magazines — sometimes sold in kits — and a homemade frame. Because that frame, often referred to as a \"lower receiver\" or \"lower,\" is the regulated body of the gun, 3D-printing that piece or otherwise creating it at home allows DIY gunmakers to skirt gun-control laws and build ghost guns with no serial number, obtained with no background check or waiting period. Chairmanwon \"instantly recognized the gun seized from the suspect...\" reported USA Today. As a photo circulated online the fake New Jersey driver's license and 3D-printed gun police found on Luigi Mangione, he spotted the tell-tale stippling pattern on the firearm's grip. \"It's mine lol,\" the man, known as \"Chairmanwon\" quipped on X Dec. 9. Then he quickly deleted the post... No federal laws ban 3D-printed or privately made firearms. But as police agencies have increasingly recovered untraceable homemade guns at crime scenes, some state legislatures have passed stricter rules... If authorities can prove Mangione downloaded and printed his firearm in Pennsylvania or New York, he could face additional gun charges. Fifteen states now require serial numbers on homemade parts or ban 3D printing them. Some even ban the distribution of 3D printing instructions. President Biden and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives added regulations in 2022 that say the ghost gun parts kits themselves qualify as \"firearms\" that should be regulated by the Gun Control Act. [\"Commercial manufacturers of the kits will have to be licensed and must add serial numbers on the kits' frame or receiver,\" USA Today reported earlier. ] Gunmakers challenged those rules at the Supreme Court. In October, the court heard oral arguments, but justices signaled they were leaning toward upholding the rules. Rolling Stone tries to assess the results: In recent years, crimes involving ghost guns seem to have abated across much of the United States. Ghost gun recoveries by police in New York City, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and other major cities dropped by as much as 25 percent between 2022 and 2023, and the most prolific maker of the kits used to build the untraceable weapons closed its doors this year. The likely cause is a federal rule change requiring the kits to be serialized — a stipulation that forces sellers to conduct background checks on their customers. Monday Luigi Mangione will appear in court for arraignment on state murder charges, reports USA Today: Mangione had been expected to face arraignment on the state charges Thursday, but the proceedings were postponed after federal authorities announced they were also bringing charges, and he was whisked to a federal courthouse instead in a move that appeared to shock Mangione's defense team... Federal authorities unsealed a criminal complaint against Mangione that included four separate charges: murder using a firearm, two counts of interstate stalking and a firearms count. The death penalty was abolished in New York state, but the federal charges could bring a death sentence if Mangione is convicted. The charge of murder using a firearm carries a maximum possible sentence of death or life in prison. The other federal charges have maximum sentences of life in prison, and the firearms charge has a mandatory minimum sentence of 30 years. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
