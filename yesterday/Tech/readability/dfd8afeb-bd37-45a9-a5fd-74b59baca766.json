  "text": "Freddy Fazbear and friends are counting down to the next big show in the first teaser for Five Nights at Freddy’s 2, which just premiered at CinemaCon before being released online by Blumhouse. Jason Blum showed up in a full Toy Freddy costume at the annual theatrical slate convention to drop the 46-second teaser trailer. It may be short, but it’s our best look yet at the highly anticipated follow-up to 2023 smash hit Five Nights at Freddy’s, based on the hit video game franchise. And the best news? The sequel will be theatrical only—unlike the first film, which debuted day-and-date on streaming. Watch the trailer here to get a spooky peek at the animatronic motley machine crew of macabre mischief makers coming back for more playtime! Stars from the first film (including Hunger Games alum Josh Hutcherson, You‘s Elizabeth Lail, and Piper Rubio) return to face the music as the band strikes up for an even bigger performance. This time they’re “everywhere,” as this clip teases, and we cannot wait for more. With Matthew Lillard’s big bad dead, did you really think death would stop William Afton’s evil plans? We’ll find out more this Christmas when Blumhouse unleashes our favorite demented animatronics for another show. Oh Chica and Carl the Cupcake, we sure missed you! Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 opens in theaters this December. Additional reporting from Germain Lussier. Want more io9 news? Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what’s next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who.",
