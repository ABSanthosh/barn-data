  "text": "Disney doesn't just hope you see the Snow White remake, it also hopes you shell out $75 for its limited-edition dolls. Disney’s live-action remake of Snow White arrives this month, and you know what that means. It’s time to push out some toys for the kids. Mattel has debuted several limited-edition, fully poseable dolls inspired by the hero (played by Rachel Zegler) and villain (Gal Gadot) of the upcoming film. Snow White’s doll features her in the blue and yellow gown with puffy sleeves, a red hooded cape, bow headband, and crimson shoes. Meanwhile, the Evil Queen doll puts her in the sparkling purple gown, a collared black cape, and a crown inspired by stained glass. Both dolls also come with extra goodies befitting their respective natures: the Queen has a scepter, her pet vulture, and a half-eaten apple, while Snow White has the uneaten apple and two birds that rest on her shoulders. Disney/Mattel The dolls will cost $75 each at the big retailers—both of Amazon’s pages are up, while Target and Walmart’s currently aren’t) and come in collector’s edition packaging with illustrated background panels. The New York Toy Fair is going on this weekend, so you might find pictures of them online, along with any other toys Mattel may have whipped up ahead of the film’s release. Disney’s been surprisingly quiet with promoting Snow White more than its previous live-action remakes—over the holidays, it felt like you couldn’t take two steps without hearing about lions wanting a brothaaaaaaaaaa—or other movies like Moana 2. That’s either indicative of the film’s quality, or maybe they’re focusing their efforts on hyping up Thunderbolts* and similarly hiding the upcoming Lilo \u0026 Stitch remake. Either way, we’ll find out when Snow White hits theaters on March 21. [via The Hollywood Reporter] Want more io9 news?
