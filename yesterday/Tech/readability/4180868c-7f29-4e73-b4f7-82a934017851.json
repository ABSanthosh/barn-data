Read Full Bio  on June 12, 2025 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Flipboard Credit: Photo Illustration by Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images Google Cloud was identified by a Cloudflare representative as the cause of a massive outage that disrupted services across the internet Thursday. The widespread internet outage affected a variety of popular platforms, with users reporting problems accessing Google services, Cloudflare, Spotify, Twitch, and Discord.The outage also included popular cloud hosting services such as Cloudflare, which reported service disruptions on its status page. However, a Cloudflare representative stated in an email to Mashable that Google Cloud was responsible for the disruptions to internet services. \"This is a Google Cloud outage,\" a Cloudflare spokesperson told Mashable by email. They added, \"A limited number of services at Cloudflare use Google Cloud and were impacted. We expect them to come back shortly. The core Cloudflare services were not impacted.\" Mashable Light Speed On the Google Cloud status page, the company initially reported that it was \"experiencing service issues with multiple GCP products beginning at Thursday, 2025-06-12 10:51 PDT.\" At 3:41 p.m. ET, Google Cloud provided a further update: \"Our engineers have identified the root cause and have applied appropriate mitigations. While our engineers have confirmed that the underlying dependency is recovered in all locations except us-central1, we are aware that customers are still experiencing varying degrees of impact on individual google cloud products. All the respective engineering teams are actively engaged and working on service recovery. We do not have an ETA for full service recovery.\"On its own status page, Cloudflare reported, \"Cloudflare’s critical Workers KV service went offline due to an outage of a 3rd party service that is a key dependency. As a result, certain Cloudflare products that rely on KV service to store and disseminate information are unavailable...\" Mashable reached out to Google for comment on the outages, and we will update this story if they respond.On Thursday afternoon, the website Down Detector showed a spike in user error reports starting around 2 p.m. ET. (Disclosure: Ziff Davis owns both Mashable and Down Detector.) By 3:30 p.m., service had been restored at many of the affected platforms, though some users are still reporting problems.
