  "text": "Christopher Reeve will forever be the definitive live-action Superman, even as other performers (up next: David Corenswet in James Gunn‘s DC Studios release) have assumed the mantle on the big and small screen. But while Reeve always delivered suitably superheroic performances—and/or adorably awkward, while in Clark Kent mode—not every Superman movie he starred in was a masterpiece. Or even, frankly, all that great. Lookin’ at you, Superman III. io9’s Germain Lussier recently dug into why Superman III is the worst among Reeve’s Man of Steel outings—yep, it’s the one where Richard Pryor helps turn Superman into an evil version of Superman using fake Kryptonite, and is “to put it bluntly, a huge piece of shit.” However, a Superman suit worn by Reeve is still a top-flight item for collectors, and the “Evil Superman” get-up from Superman III is a curiosity unto itself. Propstore has it featured in an upcoming auction, and you can understand why it’s estimated to go for $200,000-$400,000, with a starting bid of $100,000 just to get your foot in the door. Even Propstore’s description of the movie sounds satirical, which it unfortunately is not: “[In] Richard Lester’s superhero sequel Superman III. Superman wore his darker-colored costume after he was exposed to Kryptonite by Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor), when he was corrupted and turned into ‘evil’ Superman. Superman then proceeded to cause mischief, including straightening the Leaning Tower of Pisa, before drinking heavily in a bar and then fighting a weak Clark Kent in a junkyard.” It comes with the following: “a custom blue knit leotard with the stylized Superman logo sewn into the front with attached maroon trunks, a pair of matching knit tights, a cape, a belt, and a pair of boots. It is darker in color to highlight Superman’s newly corrupted nature.” © Propstore The auction house further notes that “full costumes are scarce, making this a rare opportunity to own an iconic piece of superhero history;” in 2022, People reported that Propstore had sold a complete Superman costume worn by Reeve across the first three Superman movies; it was in “fantastic” condition and fetched $359,375. The “Evil Superman” costume Reeve donned in 1983’s Superman III also looks to be in good condition; though there’s been some fading of its all-important darker color, Propstore notes that “professional costume conservators [do] believe that color restoration is feasible, pending further fabric tests.” If you have piles of spare cash lying around, and a fascination with heroes gone bad (then, inevitably, back to good again), bidding on the costume ends March 26.
