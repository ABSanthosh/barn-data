  "text": "Have you ever bought a box of matches? It’s so cheap, it’s basically free! Well, matches aren’t the only next-to-free thing. Private Internet Access, with its flash sale, aims for the title of the best inexpensive VPN service available. With a handy discount for its 24-month plan, PIA VPN gives its competitors a run for their money. But, don’t let the bottom-shelf price fool you. PIA’s package is choke-full of goodies, all waiting for you to claim them. See Offer at Private Internet Access PIA VPN is Nearly Free With This Discount There isn’t much time left to get Private Internet Access at its all-time lowest price. The VPN’s 24-month plan is sweetened with 2 free months and a massive 82% discount. That brings the cost down to just $2.19/month for the first 26 months. To clarify this flash sale, the entire package costs just under $57 for this period, and yearly thereafter. While PIA offers 6-month and 1-month plans, they’re not particularly cheap and aren’t part of the same spring sale. It’s also worth noting that Private Internet Access offers a 30-day money-back guarantee. Consider it another spice that endorses a VPN free trial for 30 days, allowing for a full refund in case you’re unsatisfied. Save Big on Its Antivirus \u0026 Dedicated IPs If you need more than a VPN, perhaps a VPN combined with antivirus should do the trick? If you’re on Windows and need additional protection, PIA Antivirus is there at 68% off and a price of a measly $1.45/mo for 2 years. Those with different needs can opt for a dedicated IP at only $2.50/mo and 50% off. Users can choose from a whopping 26 locations and enjoy some of the safest, fastest, and most reliable dedicated IP VPN addresses. More About Private Internet Access PIA VPN goes all in with this rather inviting sale. Even if you think you don’t need a VPN, you’ll be thinking twice and perhaps conclude that getting one is smart. If that’s the case, PIA is a no-brainer option in 2025. Just imagine having unlimited connections on a single subscription. Add to that unlimited bandwidth for streaming, gaming, torrenting, and everything else. Now, let’s include 30,000+ servers and a verified no-log policy. PIA doesn’t pull punches in security, either. Bank-grade GCM encryption is there, fueled by other functions like Multi-hop, Shadowsocks obfuscation, MACE ad-blocker, and servers based exclusively on RAM. While inflation did its toll on the marketplace, VPNs like these still exist. Two quids can buy you pretty much nothing today — maybe a pack of chewing gum. Now, you can also get Private Internet Access at this temporary price. Explore All PIA VPN Discounts Today",
