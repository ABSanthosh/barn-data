  "text": "Three airlines support it now, but the program will be expanding to others soon. Credit: BadPixma/Shutterstock AirTags are pretty great. They let you keep tabs on things that have a habit of going missing, like keys and wallets, and other items that are targets for theft, like bags and bikes. Of course, sometimes a bag doesn't go missing because of theft. One popular use for these tiny trackers is for tracking missing luggage: People will throw an AirTag in their bag and hand it off to their airline. If that bag doesn't make it to the luggage carousel at the destination, a quick glance at the Find My app can offer some indication as to where that bag is. If the airline tries to say \"we don't know where your bag is,\" you can hold up your iPhone and say, \"I do.\" Lost luggage is more common a problem than it should be. But, on the bright side, airlines appear to want to do something about it. It all has to do with a new Find My feature rolling out with iOS 18.2, \"Share Item Location.\" The new feature lets you temporarily share a link to your Find My accessory's location with a trusted third party. For a limited time (one week appears to be the default) they'll be able to see your item, such as an AirTag, as if it were their own Find My device, and can help you locate it. While this feature lets you share your AirTag's location with anyone you want, part of the pitch is the ability to share these locations with airlines: If your luggage goes missing, you can share your AirTag's coordinates with your airline directly—no more frustrated confrontation necessary. United Airlines was the first to announce their the support for the feature. The airline shared the news on Thursday, Dec. 12, one day after Apple released iOS 18.2 to the public. United says you'll be able to share your Find My device's location link directly to delayed baggage report tool in the airline's app. Once returned, United says it will disable the location link, but you can disable the link yourself at any time.Following this announcement, Apple's Senior Vice President of Marketing, Greg Joswiak, shared on X that Delta and Air Canada would also start supporting the feature. Unlike United, which appears to already support it, Delta and Air Canada will support it \"this week,\" so keep an eye out if you fly with any of these airlines.Apple says more airlines will support the feature in \"coming months,\" including Aer Lingus, Air New Zealand, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Eurowings, Iberia, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Lufthansa, Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Swiss International Air Lines, Turkish Airlines, Virgin Atlantic, and Vueling.To start, make sure your iPhone is running iOS 18.2 or later. Then, open Find My, tap the \"Item\" tab, then choose the item you'd like to share. Scroll down, then choose Share Item Location. Tap Continue on the popup, then either copy the link provided, or choose Share Link to share it direct with a contact. Remember that even if the airline has the link to your AirTag, it isn't a guarantee they'll know its exact location at any given moment. AirTags aren't live, real-time trackers. They have no way to constantly beam their location to the internet on their own. Instead, they rely on other internet-connected Find My devices (often iPhones) to anonymously and securely share their location to the Find My network on their behalf. Because they rely on other nearby devices to update their whereabouts, they're great for general location tracking, but not for always-updated GPS coordinates. Don't use them to track your kids, for example. Jake Peterson Senior Technology Editor Jake Peterson is Lifehacker’s Senior Technology Editor.
