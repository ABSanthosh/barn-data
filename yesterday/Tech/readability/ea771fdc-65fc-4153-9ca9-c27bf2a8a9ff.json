  "text": "American football is on everyone's minds right now thanks to the impending Super Bowl, but fascinating things are afoot in the world of association football, too. According to a statement released by game developer Sports Interactive, Football Manager 25 will not be released in March, like it was supposed to be. It's not being delayed, either, as it was already delayed from November 2024 to March. Instead, it's being canceled entirely, with development efforts being refocused on the next edition of the annual soccer management simulation. While Football Manager may not have the same name recognition in the U.S. as something like Madden, it's a very popular series for hardcore fans of soccer, focused more on roster management and scouting than in-game skill. It's also been released continuously under that name near the end of every calendar year since 2004; Football Manager 25 being delayed into March was already anomalous by series standards. Mashable Light Speed As Polygon pointed out, this will be the first year without a Football Manager since the series started. It's incredibly unusual for popular, annually released sports games to get canceled, but Sports Interactive was doing a lot of work to Football Manager 25 that made it understandably hard to finish on time. The interface and visuals were set for an overhaul, and women's soccer was to be included for the first time.Unfortunately, fans will have to wait until the next release to see any of that stuff.",
