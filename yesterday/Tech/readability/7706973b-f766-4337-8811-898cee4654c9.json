  "text": "Get a head start on planning your journey to Epic Universe—and figure out what you’re going to wear while you’re at it. The Universal Orlando Resort’s newest theme park is set to open in May and the elements you’ll encounter, from monsters to dragons to the Florida heat, should influence your style and level of comfort. Before you embark on a journey through new and exciting portals to Super Nintendo World, the Isle of Berk from How to Train Your Dragon, the Universal Monsters Dark Universe, and more, we’ve curated this guide to ensure you pop out in pop culture essentials. Official merch is available now online and at licensed retailers, so no matter which epic fandom you favor, you can pull your look together in plenty of time. This guide is a reminder to go at your own pace but also try to be prepared… and I need this advice for myself, too. © BoxLunch The two mall mainstays that come to mind first, especially if you need a quick turnaround on sizing and comfort, are BoxLunch and Hot Topic. Being able to check a website and see if inventory is available for pick-up at your local shop is far less stressful than ordering online and hoping your items will fit when they eventually arrive. We’ve all been there and it’s not ideal if packing gives you anxiety (raises hand). Even if you put things off, you can just go to the mall to visit your local coven at HT or explore the fandom wares at BoxLunch. They’ve even got some recent selections inspired by the Universal Monsters, Nintendo, and How to Train Your Dragon that are perfectly suited for the trip. Having options with buttons you can open or peel off to air that humid sweat away is very important. RSVLTS is fantastic for fashion with endurance against the elements and this Creature From the Black Lagoon-inspired polo is a great fandom-bounding option if you want to look dressed up like the Gill-man. Otherwise, outfits paying homage to Universal Monsters with capes and robes can be tricky because you don’t want to get heatstroke at a new theme park, especially if you’re lucky enough to nab tickets during its opening summer. Thankfully you can channel the Bride of Frankenstein and the Monster with Hot Topic selections like this short-sleeve tee and a femme option for Gill-man fans. Since breathable clothes are a must, this Toothless Baseball jersey with a scale design is a good option and a part of very gender-neutral selections at BoxLunch, which also include exclusive Nightfury accessories from Loungefly. And for your Mario party there’s cute accessories and tops. © Universal Orlando Resorts What’s really neat is that even Epic Universe’s official merchandise is also available to nab in advance. At least with going this route, if a size doesn’t work and you don’t realize it until you’re in Florida, as long as you have your proof of purchase you can probably exchange it at Universal. The selection is not entirely what’s available at the theme parks as of previews, but still very solid especially when it comes to theming. In particular the How to Train Your Dragon selection is extensive with cosplay lite Toothless hats, fashionable attire for women, men, and children plus water bottle holders. I know that sounds odd to cape for cozy drinkware sleeves but these have cute designs, like this Toothless one, and can hang off strollers. I use one of mine from Universal for that specifically while taking my kiddo to the parks so I don’t have to buy the expensive drink cup attachment. ©Universal Orlando Resorts The widest selection of pre-arrival shopping I would say is the Universal Monsters. The Dark Universe branded character re-designs of Dracula and friends are going to be a hot commodity. I’d say grab some of the official apparel and accessories now because they might be sold out when you get there. There’s a market for flippers that raid the newly branded merch, which can put a damper on a first visit if you were hoping to get something “Dark Universe” branded, only to find it’s all gone. So get it while you can if the item you were looking for is available online already. This Bride of Frankenstein hair bucket hat, cute monsters steel tumbler, and Baby Dracula backpack are too clever—I don’t trust them still being there come May. And then there’s the parks-exclusive Super Nintendo World official releases which are as close to the real Nintendo store as we can get, so don’t miss out on the newest arrivals. Epic Universe opens May 22; for more information and tickets visit here. Want more io9 news?
