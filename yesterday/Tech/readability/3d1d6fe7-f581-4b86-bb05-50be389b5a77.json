  "text": "Cookware set sizeOne big consideration is what pieces are included and if they are essential to your kitchen or not. There are cookware sets as big as 14 pieces but they are generally going to have lots of pots and pans in a range of sizes that you probably won't use. I wouldn't suggest going bigger than eight or nine pieces (this includes lids counted as pieces) unless you have both the space and money for all those extras.Picking the right cookware materialThe most important decision you'll make is what material your pots and pans are made from. Cookware is commonly constructed from aluminum, cast iron, stainless steel, copper, nonstick chemical compounds (Teflon) or a combination of several materials. As you might guess, each type of cookware surface has its pros and cons as it relates to cooking, cleaning, durability and storage.Aluminum cookware is cheap, for example, but it is not very durable and I wouldn't recommend buying a fully aluminum set. Stainless steel pots and pans will better withstand abuse and won't warp or dent like aluminum. Stainless steel is also a slow conductor of heat, which is why steel pans often have a core made from a more conductive material such as aluminum or copper.For most people, stainless-steel cookware fitted with an aluminum core will be the best material composition for a set. Materials such as copper and cast iron have advantages but also some serious pitfalls. Cast iron and carbon steel are both a bit heavy and require slightly more involved cleaning and care, so you might not want an entire set. Copper cookware is also more difficult to care for and generally costs much more than its stainless-steel counterparts.Nonstick is another popular option. I recommend having at least one nonstick skillet -- either Teflon or ceramic -- for eggs and other sticky foods. You'll never be able to sear food using nonstick the way you can with other materials, so keep that in mind if you're opting for a fully nonstick cookware set. It also won't last as long since nonstick coatings break down over time.Cost and budgetWith cookware, you'll get what you pay for, but that doesn't mean you need to pay more than its worth. High-end copper cookware and stainless steel collections can run well into the thousands, but a quality set of pots and pans doesn't need to cost you much more than a few hundred.Cheap cookware is different from budget-friendly. Our value pick is still plenty sturdy to handle your nightly recipes and shouldn't warp for many years. If you settle for cheap cookware, you might end up with busted handles and burned salmon from uneven heating.Nonstick and cast-iron cookware are the most inexpensive materials and there are reliable sets for under $100. Good stainless steel cookware sets of three or four pans will typically cost a few hundred dollars. Copper cookware is the most expensive and typically costs around $500 or more, even a small set.",
