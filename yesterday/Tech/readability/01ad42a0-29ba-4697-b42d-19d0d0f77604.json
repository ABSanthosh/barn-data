The software is designed to modernise existing military vehicles through AI, sensor systems, and autonomous driving capabilities. The company estimates it can retrofit 50,000 NATO vehicles with the tech. The co-founder and CEO of ARX, Marc Wietfeld ‚Äî who will speak at TNW Conference and the Assembly in June ‚Äî wants his company to become the European leader in the segment. ‚ÄúThe demand for modular, software-driven defence systems is growing rapidly ‚Äî and we‚Äôre building the company that will define this category in Europe‚Äù, said Wietfeld.

Sign up now!Earlier this month, ARX announced plans to invest ¬£45mn into a new UK facility, where it will build its autonomous ground vehicles. The company expects the plant to produce 1,800 war robots each year once up and running. ARX‚Äôs machines drive around on treads and can be fitted with equipment such as radar, mine-sweeping devices, or medical stretchers. The largest carries military payloads weighing up to 500kg ‚Äî including injured soldiers ‚Äî across the battlefield.¬† The robots are modular, built using off-the-shelf components made in Europe. They‚Äôre designed so soldiers can fix them on the battlefield within minutes, without tools. The vehicles move around autonomously, but military personnel can also control them remotely from a tablet. Rise of defence tech The armed forces of Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Hungary, and the UK have already conducted field tests of ARX‚Äôs technology. In February, the company delivered 30 of its war bots to Ukrainian Armed Forces units engaged in active combat. The European Defence Agency (EDA) also recently contracted ARX to participate in the first EU-wide defence innovation initiative. ‚ÄúARX Robotics has fielded the largest Western UGV fleet to Ukraine and we look forward to continuing to support the company as it expands its reach across NATO nations,‚Äù said Chris O‚ÄôConnor, partner at NATO Innovation Fund. HV Capital was the leading investor in the company‚Äôs new Series A funding round. Omnes Capital and existing investors NATO Innovation Fund and Project A also chipped in. ARX‚Äôs raise comes amid substantial increases in European defence spending in recent months.¬† In March 2025, EU leaders endorsed the ‚ÄúReArm Europe‚Äù plan, aiming to mobilise up to ¬£683bn (‚Ç¨800bn) over the next four years to enhance military capabilities. The UK government, meanwhile, has committed to raising defence spending to 2.5% of GDP and wants to spend at least 10% of its defence budget on ‚Äúinnovative technologies.‚Äù If you want to watch Marc Wietfeld‚Äôs talk or anything else on the packed agenda¬†for TNW Conference, we have a special offer for you.
