  "description": "Samsung's CES 2025 theme is \"AI for all.\"Samsung Samsung is the 800-pound gorilla of CES, a global electronics giant that produces mobile devices, TVs and home theater products and kitchen appliances — just to name a few. It's traditionally used CES to remind the world that it's a major competitor in all those arenas, while offering a peek behind the curtain of some more cutting-edge tech, too.  In 2024, for instance, Samsung's CES press conference covered all the usual iterative updates — new TVs, new projectors, new soundbars — but also offered up some genuinely futuristic product first looks as well. And while we won't see the transparent MicroLED screens at the local Best Buy anytime soon, you can already buy the Music Frame speaker that was first shown off at CES 2024. But it's the Ballie robot, a two-time CES veteran, that we're most hoping will make a return appearance — ideally with a real-world release date this time. What to expect at the Samsung CES 2025 press conference Or perhaps Ballie will be more autonomous this time around. That would better fit the \"AI for All: Everyday, Everywhere\" theme that the company has announced for its presentation in Las Vegas. The Korea-based giant has already posted several weeks worth of early CES announcements in its online newsroom, touting AI-enhanced refrigerators and appliances with built-in screens. But there's non-AI stuff, too: Samsung has preannounced a 27-inch QD-OLED gaming monitor, and the company is teaming up with Google (!) to deliver Eclipsa, a new 3D audio technology that is apparently aiming to be an alternative to Dolby Atmos and DTS.  One thing you shouldn't expect to see in Vegas: The presumed Galaxy S25 smartphone line. If it follows its recent scheduling, Samsung will likely slate that unveiling for the second half of January, when it will have the tech news spotlight to itself.
