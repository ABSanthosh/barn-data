  "description": "Motorola is gearing up to announce new phones on April 24, based on a short teaser video the company shared on X. The video shows what looks like two types of phone â€” presumably a member of the 2025 Razr family and a Moto Edge â€” sliding and unfolding into place to spell \"AI.\" There's little else to go on from the video other than the April 24, 2025 date and a glimpse of some new finish options for Motorola's phones, including a wood option. Last year's Razr and Razr+ came in a variety of bright, poppy colors with faux suede and leather backs. Historically, Motorola has also prided itself on offering unique customizations options, starting all the way back with the Moto X in 2013, which was also available with a wooden finish. It's possible that wood-paneled options ends up exclusive to the Moto Edge, but it would certainly make the Razr and Razr+ standout from other foldables if they got it, too. Big reveals.

It's made the front cover screen bigger before, and it could again on the 2025 Razr. The 2025 Razr+ couldn't get a bigger front display without Motorola changing the dimensions of the phone itself, but that's possible, too. If Motorola wanted to really offer a Razr worth upgrading to, it would also improve the phone's camera, fixing things like color reproduction and photo processing.Â  We should have a better idea of what Motorola has planned when it makes its April 24 announcement, until then, smart money is on the company cramming in a few more AI-powered features.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/youll-have-to-wait-until-april-24-to-know-if-motorola-was-brave-enough-to-make-a-wooden-razr-211723767.html?src=rss",
