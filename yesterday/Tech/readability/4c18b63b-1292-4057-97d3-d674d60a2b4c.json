  "text": "Also: Wednesday S2 sneak peek, Stranger Things S5 premiere date, Frankenstein teaser, more Benoit Blanc Squid Game returns this month for its third and final season. Credit: Netflix Netflix held its Tudum Global Fan Event in Los Angeles this weekend to showcase its upcoming slate of programming. Among the highlights: the official trailer for the third and final season of Squid Game, the first six minutes of Wednesday S2, a teaser for Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein, and date announcements for the fifth and final season of Stranger Things, as well as Wake Up Dead Man: a Knives Out Mystery. (Some spoilers below.) Squid Game S3 As previously reported, Squid Game's first season followed Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-Jae), a down-on-his-luck gambler who has little left to lose when he agrees to play children's playground games against 455 other players for money. The twist? If you lose a game, you die. If you cheat, you die. And if you win, you might also die. In the S1 finale, Gi-hun faced off against fellow finalist and childhood friend Cho Sang-woo (Park Hae-soo) in the titular \"squid game.\" He won their fight but refused to kill his friend. Sang-woo instead stabbed himself in the neck, leaving Gi-hun the guilt-ridden winner. S2 was set three years later. Gi-hun successfully finagled his way back into the game, intent on revenge against the Front Man (Lee Byung-hun). Meanwhile, Front Man's police officer brother, Jun-ho (Wi Ha-joon), hired mercenaries to track down the island where the game is staged. Alliances formed and shifted as the games proceeded, with betrayals galore, culminating in the loss of Gi-hun's friend and ally Player 390 and a cliffhanger ending. Series creator Hwang Dong-hyuk conceived of S2 and S3 as a single season, but there were too many episodes, so he split them over two seasons. Back in January we got our first glimpse of S3 when Netflix released a 15-second teaser on X, introducing a brand new killer doll dubbed Chul-su—similar to the giant \"Red Light, Green Light\" doll Young-hee. Per the official premise: A failed rebellion, the death of a friend, and a secret betrayal. Picking up in the aftermath of Season 2’s bloody cliffhanger, the third and final season of Netflix’s most popular series finds Gi-hun, a.k.a. Player 456, at his lowest point yet. But the Squid Game stops for no one, so Gi-hun will be forced to make some important choices in the face of overwhelming despair as he and the surviving players are thrust into deadlier games that test everyone’s resolve. With each round, their choices lead to increasingly grave consequences. Meanwhile, In-ho resumes his role as Front Man to welcome the mysterious VIPs, and his brother Jun-ho continues his search for the elusive island, unaware there’s a traitor in their midst. Will Gi-hun make the right decisions, or will Front Man finally break his spirit? The third season of Squid Game drops on Netflix on June 27, 2025. Wednesday S2 Star Jenna Ortega put her own stamp on the iconic title character in the first season of Wednesday. At Tudum, Netflix introduced footage of S2's first six minutes with a performance by Lady Gaga, who emerged from a coffin to perform a couple of spooky numbers—including \"Bloody Mary\" from Born This Way. (We can thank a a viral video featuring the tune set to Wednesday's fantastic S1 dancing sequence for that.) As previously reported, along with Ortega, most of the main cast is returning for S2, including Emma Myers as Enid, and Joy Sunday as Bianca. Reprising their roles: Luis Guzman and Catherine Zeta-Jones as Gomez and Morticia Addams; Isaac Ordonez as Pugsley Addams; Victor Dorobantu as Thing; Fred Armisen as Uncle Fester; Luyanda Unati Lewis-Nyawo as Deputy Ritchie Santiago; Hunter Doohan as Tyler Galpin, revealed as a murderous Hyde in the S1 finale; and Jamie McShane as Donovan Galpin, the Jericho sheriff and Tyler's father (McShane is a guest this season). We'll miss Gwendoline Christie's Principal Larissa Weems and Christina Ricci's diabolical botany teacher, Marilyn Thornhill (RIP to both), but at least we're getting the fabulous Joanna Lumley as Hester Frump, Morticia's mother. Other new cast members include Billie Piper as Capri, Steve Buscemi as new Nevermore principle Barry Dort, and Evie Templeton, Owen Painter, and Noah Tyler in as-yet-undisclosed roles. Bonus: Lady Gaga will make a guest appearance in the show and as we see in the new footage, Haley Joel Osment makes a cameo. Wednesday S2 will air in two installments. Part 1 debuts August 6, 2025. Part 2 is coming on September 3, 2025. Stranger Things S5 It's been a long, wild ride with the plucky residents of Hawkins, but we're finally approaching the ultimate showdown against the dark force that has plagued the town since S1. The fifth season will have eight episodes and each one will be looong—akin to eight feature-length films. In addition to the returning main cast, Amybeth McNulty and Gabriella Pizzolo are back as Vicki and Dustin's girlfriend, Suzie, respectively, with Jamie Campbell Bower reprising his role as the ultimate Big Bad, now known as Vecna. Linda Hamilton joins the cast as Dr. Kay, along with Nell Fisher as Holly Wheeler, Jake Connelly as Derek Turnbow, and Alex Breaux as Lt. Akers S4 ended with Vecna opening the gate that allowed the Upside Down to leak into Hawkins. We're getting a time jump for S5, but in a way we're coming full circle, since the events coincide with the third anniversary of Will's original disappearance in S1. Per the official premise: The fall of 1987. Hawkins is scarred by the opening of the Rifts, and our heroes are united by a single goal: find and kill Vecna. But he has vanished — his whereabouts and plans unknown.  Complicating their mission, the government has placed the town under military quarantine and intensified its hunt for Eleven, forcing her back into hiding. As the anniversary of Will’s disappearance approaches, so does a heavy, familiar dread. The final battle is looming—and with it, a darkness more powerful and more deadly than anything they’ve faced before.  To end this nightmare, they’ll need everyone—the full party — standing together, one last time. The fifth and final season of Stranger Things will drop in not one, not two, but three installments, because apparently Netflix wants to be as annoying as possible. Volume 1 premieres on November 26, 2025; Volume 2 drops on Christmas Day, December 25, 2025; and the series finale will air on New Year’s Eve, December 31, 2025. Frankenstein Oscar-wining director Guillermo del Toro has been dreaming of adapting Mary Shelley's Frankenstein for the big screen for more than a decade. There have been so many adaptations of Shelley's novel, of varying quality, and even more reinventions and homages (cf. Poor Things) We finally have the first teaser for del Toro's take, and it's as sumptuously horrifying and visually rich as one would expect from the man who made such films as Pan's Labyrinth and The Shape of Water. Per the official premise: \"“A brilliant but egotistical scientist brings a creature to life in a monstrous experiment that ultimately leads to the undoing of both the creator and his tragic creation.” The events take place in 19th century Eastern Europe. Oscar Isaac stars as Victor Frankenstein, with Jacob Elordi playing the monster. Christopher Waltz plays Dr. Pretorious, who hopes to continue in Victor's footsteps by tracking his monster—who, it turns out, did not die in a fire 40 years before. The cast also includes Mia Goth as Victor's fiancee, Elizabeth; Felix Kammerer as Williams; Lars Mikkelsen as Captain Anderson; David Bradley as a blind man; and Ralph Inseon as Professor Kempre. Charles Dance will also appear in as as-yet-undisclosed role. Frankenstein premieres on Netflix in November 2025. Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery Rian Johnson's Knives Out series of films is still going strong, with the third installment featuring Daniel Craig's languorously brilliant detective, Benoit Blanc slated to premiere a couple of weeks before Christmas. It's called Wake Up Dead Man, a title that pays homage to the 1997 U2 song of the same name. Johnson is playing his cards close to the chest about the plot details. But we do know he's assembled another all-star cast of murderous suspects: Josh O'Connor, Glenn Close, Josh Brolin, Mila Kunis, Jeremy Renner—whose \"Renning Hot\" chili pepper sauce featured prominently in Glass Onion—Kerry Washington, Andrew Scott, Cailee Spaeny, Daryl McCormack, and Thomas Haden Church. Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery drops on Netflix on December 12, 2025—or if you want to be all Benoit Blanc about it, XII.XII.MMXXV.
