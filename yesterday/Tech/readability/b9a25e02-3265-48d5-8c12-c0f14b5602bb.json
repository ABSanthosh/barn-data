  "text": "Dyson has always been the crème de la crème when it comes to cordless stick vacuums and the V15 Detect Plus is one of the latest and most advanced models in their lineup. It has a reputation for having the latest technology and powerful suction force, and the V15 Detect Plus takes cleaning to new levels. Amazon is marking Prime Day with a exclusive Prime member offer that cuts the price to an all-time low of $569, down from its usual $749. That’s even lower than some of Dyson’s older models which is high praise for a flagship device that’s packed with the newest technology. See at Amazon Our Favorite Model The V15 Detect Plus is famous for its innovative green laser feature which projects a beam across your floors to reveal dust and particles that would otherwise go unnoticed. This laser technology is not merely a shiny gimmick but it does actually come in handy for allowing you to locate the dust so you can clean more effectively and thoroughly. The Dyson V15 also has great suction power with a high-torque motor that automatically takes power down as needed based on what type of floor it’s cleaning and how much dust it’s detecting. On top, Dyson’s fully-sealed filtration removes 99.99% of particles as small as 0.3 microns and it’s a great option for people with allergies. The vacuum even comes equipped with an LCD screen that provides you with real-time feedback including the volume and quantity of particles being captured, battery life, and active cleaning mode. What’s more, you receive 60 minutes of fade-free power from a single charge which is more than sufficient for most homes. The vacuum comes with an assortment of attachments including a high-torque cleaner head, crevice tool and combination tool so you can clean everything from carpets and floors to furniture and tight spaces. It’s easy and hygienic to empty the dustbin with Dyson’s point-and-shoot mechanism expelling rubbish with one press. The dock on the wall will keep the vacuum charged and ready to use and store the machine and attachments easily. If you’re looking for the ultimate in cordless vacuum technology at the best price yet, now is the perfect time to make the upgrade. See at Amazon",
