  "text": "It's time for DC Studios' new Man of Steel to restart not just the film universe but entertainment and attractions too. There’s nostalgia for the Batman movie era at Six Flags as we head toward a new DC Studios era with Superman, On a recent invited visit to Magic Mountain to check out DC Heroes and Villains Fest, I found myself reminiscing fondly about the stunt shows from the ’90s. Both Batman Forever and Batman \u0026 Robin were draws as WB movie-inspired attractions for folks who didn’t want to only do roller coasters. The most vivid memory I have is Batman swinging into action and riding in the Batmobile for the explosive, stunt-heavy Magic Mountain version of the show. The Caped Crusader teamed up with Robin and Batgirl against Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy for super abridged versions of the film’s plot against perfectly dilapidated Gotham sets. At Astroworld in Texas, an early version of the show took place in a water arena where the iconic DC duo took on the Riddler and Two-Face in a high-octane show with jet skis and a helicopter. For a while, DC Entertainment seemed invested in being a worthy competitor to the outdoor staged experiences presented at Universal Studios Hollywood or even The Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular at Walt Disney World. But then, more and more, all the coaster-centric parks began to only license DC iconography to slip on steel coasters, including Batman: The Ride, Riddler’s Revenge, and Superman: The Ride. With little to no effort on theming, investment in places where you could immerse yourself in the world of these characters was nowhere to be found for years. Sure, there would be some slight attempts, like a meet and greet here or there timed to ride openings, but gone was the value placed in thematic storytelling to draw repeat visits. Only the memories and the Batmobile from the long-gone stunt shows remain for photo ops. During Christopher Nolan’s Batman era, the thing that most reinvigorated DC and Warner Bros.’ interest in participatory entertainment was an ARG marketing campaign. The level of immersion with Animal Repair Shop’s The Dark Knight: Why So Serious? experience made the world a theme park. Fans who wanted to learn more about the second Nolan film were able to participate in flash Joker Mobs at places like San Diego Comic-Con or follow clues in other major cities to shopping centers or college campuses to collect artifacts from the yet-to-be-released film. Even in the digital world, the internet landscape was changed as Batman fans unlocked the first look at Heath Ledger’s Joker. It was a game changer and one that at least some major theme parks sought to bring into their offerings, except seemingly Six Flags. In 2010 things changed in theme parks when Universal Studios opened the first major themed land based on a film franchise with The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. The irony being, of course, that Warner Bros. partnered with a competing theme park for this—all while having DC Comics just be stickers to slap on any given coaster. Wizarding World lit a fire that would go on to motivate the landscape to evolve quickly from just having attractions or shows touting a major IP. Now, the blueprint was set to make whole areas that take you into the world of your favorite fandom, paving the way for Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge and Avengers Campus at Disney Parks and, most recently, Universal’s own Epic Universe. Warner Bros. has had an international arm that’s put familiar properties in various theme parks around the world, notably in Spain and Australia with Warner Bros. Movie World parks. These were essentially original regional parks in major metropolitan cities that partnered with WB to rebrand into Movie World Parks. They very often get better production value for their properties with DC Comics, The Wizard of Oz, and The Looney Tunes at their amusement parks, while we get paint refreshes on existing coasters. Before you surmise that “Wow, DC fans really got the short end here,” you might be surprised to learn that there is a fully realized DC Universe land: Warner Bros. World on Yas Island in Abu Dhabi. The first from-the-ground-up WB theme park, it opened in 2018 and predates Galaxy’s Edge with multiple themed lands designed by the Thinkwell Group, a hub of park and immersive designers. Here you’ll find Gotham and Metropolis as two separate areas with attractions inspired by the worlds of Batman and Superman. There are meet and greets with multiple characters throughout, from heroes to villains; even the Looney Tunes get fully decked out in DC Comics gear too. The ads for this park are always making us feel like we’re truly missing out. The most we got around that time of its opening was a single dark ride in the form of Six Flags’ Justice League: Battle for Metropolis. Which brings us to the DCEU phase, in which Six Flags got some costume redesigns inspired by the New 52 on select DC characters with limited engagements on appearances throughout the country. The Warner Bros. Studios tour in Burbank expanded to feature interactive displays with costumes from the Snyderverse films and tour set stops. My favorite experience of this era was when the studio decided to try its hand at hosting its own Halloween after-dark ticketed event. With Horror Made Here, scary walk-throughs based on franchises like The Conjuring and Friday the 13th were joined by an Arkham Asylum maze where the Joker and Harley turned guests into inmates. It was scary and delightfully demented with elements of immersive storytelling and escape room antics. Alas, Horror Made Here was only around for one year; every year we hope it comes back. As the DCEU neared its end, a new Wonder Woman coaster opened at Six Flags Magic Mountain with little fanfare. By that point, fans’ relationship with the brand had perhaps been pulled in too many directions. © Gaylord Texan As we enter DC Studios’ next chapter with the release of James Gunn’s Superman, its heroes and villains are being scattered throughout various summer offerings. The most exciting-sounding one is being run in collaboration with the Gaylord Hotels, which is transforming a number of its resorts with a “DC Summer” theme for the 2025 season. The offerings include superhero training with the Justice League, meet and greets, nighttime spectaculars, themed meals like a Harley and Joker buffet, a Riddler-themed immersive scavenger hunt, and a secret villains bar at select locations. There’s even an expansive comic-book-come-to-life illuminated walk-through experience: Universe of Light at the Gaylord Texan, with heroic and splash-page-themed art installations for the whole family to enjoy. Meanwhile, as Six Flags undergoes its current phase of new ownership through Cedar Fair, there’s been a resurgence of the characters at select locations, including Magic Mountain in California. For the summer, the West Coast park has “DC Heroes and Villains Fest,” featuring a small parade cavalcade of characters from DC Comics and a cluster of themed food booths. With a new stage show that’s more of a dance party than a stunt spectacular on the level of what was there in the ’90s. There are some signs of progress with seeing how kids excitedly react to seeing Superman and his super friends take on Lex Luthor and the Joker which makes it at least worth the while. But on the whole, it’s just a whole bunch of coaster-centric activities that are not as accessible as other places. © io9 Gizmodo It still just feels like a missed opportunity to start anew alongside DC Studios. The costumes still harken to the New 52, aiming to pull in fans with the recognizable iconography alone. On a recent visit to Six Flags Magic Mountain, we found the food was good but definitely still felt lacking in regard to theming, though that just might be because there were only three booths with a few options. Overall, it isn’t too different from some of the recent things Six Flags has been doing anyway for the summer season around the country. It’s just too all over the place to feel a part of what’s next. The effort at the parks has room to evolve as Superman arrives. The Warner Bros. Studio Tour feels more connected to what’s to come: the DC area of the walkthrough for the tour includes a celebration of past projects while shifting focus to the now. There are costumes from Matt Reeves’ The Batman on display right out of the Batcave, which feels and sounds like it with incredible screens that transport you there with a touch of that Nolan feel. And James Gunn’s mark is starting to take hold; you exit with a Daily Planet desk illuminating the new tone of the DC Studios era. The costumes for Clark Kent, Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, and the Superman suit fill the place with excitement against a Fortress of Solitude display. Even the WB store, which is a modern version of the ones from the mall in the ’90s, got redone with Metropolis set pieces to admire while you shop, complete with a Krypto the dog plush fountain. Somehow that evoked more theme park vibes than anything else we’ve experienced so far in the world of DC comics this year. While we see places like WB World Abu Dhabi soar, we hope that stateside we get more invested in incorporating everything this massive fandom is missing out on. With the arrival of more DC Studios here, let’s hope their worlds immerse ours and we can go up, up, and away too. Want more io9 news?
