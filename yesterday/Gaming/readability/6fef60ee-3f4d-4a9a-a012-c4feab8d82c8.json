The LG Evo C4 is an outstanding TV that has won top spots in several of our buying guides, including best 4K TV, best TV for gaming, and best TV for the PlayStation 5. This is an especially good buy if you picked up the new PS5 Pro, since the updated hardware will be able to run more games at a consistent 4K @ 120fps.55\" LG Evo C4 4K OLED Smart TV: The Best PS5 TV55\" LG Evo C4 4K OLED Smart TVLog into your Walmart account (free to sign up)The C4 is the current generation 2024 model among LG's highly vaunted C-series OLED TV lineup. It's an incremental upgrade over the 2023 C3, with the most noticeable improvements being an upgraded processor, newer WebOS smart interface, support for DTS audio, and a higher 144Hz refresh rate. This is a true OLED TV, which is the best type of TV you can get right now. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times. The C4 uses LG's Evo panel, which offers higher brightness levels than traditional OLED TVs. Because of these advantages, the OLED TV excels at displaying 4K HDR content in all of its intended glory. Compared to other OLED TV brands, LG has the most generations of updates and improvements so we're keen to choose this brand over others.The C4 also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV. It has four HDMI 2.1 ports all capable of up to 144Hz refresh rate at 4K resolution. That's great news for PS5 (and now PS5 Pro), Xbox Series X, and PC gamers, since several games can be played at frame rates of 120fps and beyond. The C4 also supports variable refresh rate (VRR) including NVIDIA G-SYNC and auto low latency mode (ALLM). When connected to a PC, it supports chroma 4:4:4 for better text legibility.A particularly nice feature that isn't advertised often is the surprisingly light weight of the C4. The 55\" TV weighs in at only 31.1 pounds without the stand. That's because the rear cabinet housing is made of a composite fiber that's lighter than the plastics most TVs use. It might not matter much in the long term, but this is a welcome advantage when you are first setting up your TV, especially if you plan on wall mounting.Should You Buy Now or Wait for Black Friday?Although this is an extremely good discount for one of our favorite gaming TVs, you may be wondering if you should wait until Black Friday to make a purchase. While it's likely that Black Friday 2024 will have lower prices on the LG C4 TV in general, we've never seen a current model 55\" LG OLED TV sell for under $1,000. If you are looking for another size, waiting for Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals is probably the right call. But this discount makes this particular deal easily one of the best TV deals happening right now.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
