He explained that Nightdive would approach the developers about remastering their games and ask them what they'd do differently if they had the chance and a larger budget.Additionally, bringing over older games to new hardware clears up issues like stuttering frame rates and long load times that occurred on their original platforms. In addition to giving players easier access to older games, bringing over old titles to new hardware clears up issues like stuttering frame rates and long load times that occurred on their original platforms. Despite this, however, there has been some hesitancy around remastering PS3 games, as they can also prove difficult due to its unique system architecture. However, Nightdive says that it's up for the challenge.\"If we get to that, or I should say, when, we get to the PS3 era games, it will be a challenge that we have to face,\" Kick explained. \"But I think that we’ve had enough experience to where we can do a serviceable job on a PS3 remaster.\"In other Nightdive Studios news, Kuperman recently said that an update regarding the development of System Shock 3 could come sometime within the next year.
