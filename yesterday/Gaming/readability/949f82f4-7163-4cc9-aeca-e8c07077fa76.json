Even as I was getting laid off at West, a friend had pinged me asking if I was interested in a position.  He was going off to work for the State of California which was hiring some developers to staff up a group with a specific mission.  He knew somebody who worked there, had talked to the manager of the group, and knew that they had multiple spots, possibly even for a generalist like myself. The TLDR for this post is the following meme. 2024 me running into old co-workers He got me hooked up with the boss and I had a chat with him about what they were doing and the position and wanted to know if I could fill the role of a project manager.  He didn’t ask if I had been a project manager or if I had any certifications that might prove that… the state is very big on being certified for this or that… he asked if I could fill that role.  That brought a particular movie quote to mind. Ray, when someone asks you if you’re a God, you say YES! -Winston Zeddemore, Ghostbusters I said yes.  I mean, I could point to years of relevant experience, effectively being the project manager was part of my role when in management due to the fact that Silicon Valley hates people in that role and they are the first to be laid off in any development group… they and designers are even less loved than the QA team… and I could cite work experience that aligned with the requirements of the position. Hell, I was golden on experience.  This group was going to use agile methodology, paired programming, and test driven development to make cloud based web apps for the state.  I could honestly say I was working with all of that at that very moment, still being in the period between notification and my actual termination. I did not explain that my experience at West with those things were, if not an abject failure, then certainly never going to be used as a textbook example of success.  West wanted to say it had those things, but wasn’t willing to commit fully to getting there.  Yes, we got a couple SAFe agile courses and we had an agile coach for a few months who got paid to tell us to color only within specific lines and would not allow that any specific situation might not be fully covered by the world view he was paid to espouse.  I find this map of the “agile landscape” useful in reminding me that anybody who has a religious fervor about one particular model is a heretic to somebody else. The Deloitte Agile Landscape map from… 2019 I think… There was also very much the “those who cannot do, teach” feeling to our coach. Meanwhile, the devs just straight up revolted against test driven development and paired programming.  We worked across remote offices and would soon all be working from home and nobody wanted to sit on Zoom or whatever… West had picked Cisco Teams as its platform despite owning a competitor, InterCall, for more than a dozen years at that point… so the pairing aspect never flew. (Side note: During the pandemic they did try to make us use InterCall’s competitor to Zoom, called Hoot, which basically didn’t work very well, a problem with a lot of InterCall’s stuff at that point, they having focused on costs rather than new business for all those years.) Basically, West wanted everybody to “Just Do It!” as Nike would say, without anybody delaying any project by even a minute, which was too much of an ask.  Adopting a new work style like paired programming is an effort, and for a month or two, until you find the balance, it is exhausting and feels counter-productive and it is often easy to slip into just one person doing the work if the pair is just getting sick of it.  And test driven development… well, I know somebody must have made that work, but to this day I haven’t seen it fully adopted.  How to even write those tests is a whole new mental model that takes time. So I had experience with all those things and could talk about them in some depth.  I was happy that I wasn’t pressed very hard on how successful the effort had been.  (I wouldn’t have hidden it.  Knowing the breaks is useful too, and I could have sold that, but you never know how that is going to land.  Some people only want to hire staff that claims they hit a home run at every at bat.) Anyway, the interview went well.  They said a position would be opening up on the state site and that, once it was up I should apply for it and take the test for the position and then they would start in on the hiring process. If that sounds easy, let me assure you that getting hired by the state is not a trivial hurdle.  They have a whole automated web site for it and if you get annoyed when a company asks you to upload your resume then turns around and asks you to basically type it all in again… well, they haven’t got anything on the state.  I spent a week in December doing all that and taking “the test” which is essentially a third run at entering your resume again, but this time with feeling and anecdotes and justifications about why you should be hired.  It is a cover letter, resume, and interview all in one, which starts to feel redundant when you also have to provide a resume (and the type it in again), a cover letter, and do interviews. A lot of this is similar to the current state of the great wall of HR at many corporations, but there are also signs that you are entering the government employment zone.  That includes the need to speak about salaries in increments of one month.  The various levels of government like to do payroll just once a month.  This, in and of itself is just a thing, but in the outside world companies have fixed on an every other week, 26 paychecks a year payroll system, so I knew what I was getting paid at various jobs in a paycheck level, or an hourly level for the stints as a contractor, but there was a bit of math that I kept having to do to the relay and compare what I was getting paid before and what compensation was being offered. Also, based on my experience I expected to get hired above minimum, which requires a whole additional set of forms and justifications and at one point I had to demonstrate my knowledge of Microsoft Office products because that is important to the state! The state is setup to hire somebody at the minimum and then train them up into higher levels, a pleasant contrast to Silicon Valley where the current hiring meta is to only bring on people who can produce value on day one and the idea of training anybody is viewed as absurd.  That is a big change from the 90s when the valley was so hungry for talent.  But then, they hadn’t discovered H1-B visas yet. After all that and interviews and approvals and validations and having to fill out a stunning number of forms… a good portion of which wanted to know if I was a veteran because the state makes a big effort to hire veterans, so when you demand cuts to the government workforce, you are often hitting veterans directly… I was finally given an offer to start roughly six months after the first phone call. In the mean time I had applied for a bunch of jobs as a backup plan, and actually had a couple good interviews with LinkedIn for a position that sounded almost tailored for my skill set and background before they decided against me.  The irony was that LinkedIn was also a painful place to apply for jobs and I am pretty sure there is now a special place in Hell for recruiters there who blow smoke up your ass then ghost you.  I’ve heard the excuses, you’re still a bad person if you do that. I was taking a bit of a pay cut from my last job, which wasn’t exactly offering a competitive Silicon Valley salary, another reason I was looking the whole time I was there, but the benefits package was excellent and so much cheaper that in the end, when you did the payroll conversion, my take home pay was a bit more. Which leads me to what I do for the state and how software development even works when it comes to government projects. First off, the state has some rules about social media and posting online, so I will at this point make it clear that everything here is my opinion and that I do not in any way represent the State of California or any of its agencies.  I just work there as a rank and file member of state staff and do not have any role in policy, procurement, or related purchasing decisions.  I just try to make stuff with the tools provided. There is a school of thought out there that says no government should make things or in anyway produce something that would compete with private industry in and possible way.  And there is some justification for that.  You can look around the world or at our own history and find examples of government agencies running businesses poorly. The problem is that here, in the US, that philosophy has been taken to its extreme by the billionaires and huge corporations.  Those that complain the most vociferously about taxes and government waste also just happen to be the recipients of huge amounts of taxpayer largess.  And it isn’t just Elon Musk, whose fortunes and companies would vanish in a fortnight if it wasn’t for government programs, whose hypocrisy about government spending stands out.  Seriously, government programs get cancelled for him and he would be the CEO of a pile of companies headed into bankruptcy.  So when he is talking about the Department of Government Efficiency, the only efficiency he wants is in the form of tax dollars into his pocket. We always hear about military contracts and $10,000 toilet seats, but this goes through and through all the way down to your local city or town.  Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, and SAP make huge amounts of money from government contracts.  The all have divisions dedicated to separating as many tax payer dollars from the government as possible.  And they all put pressure on governments to upgrade and adopt whatever they are pushing. So I was a bit surprised to show up at the state and find the place pretty much run by Microsoft products.  I was suffering from a bit of 90s Microsoft anti-trust hangover I guess, when states were suing the pirates in Redmond.  We all got over that I guess and now shovel piles of cash into their corporate maw.  And those titans fight over their huge slices of the government pie.  I chose a Salesforce product at one point and was warned that the Microsoft faction was trying to eliminate that and even got a visit from our Microsoft rep who basically threatened to tell the deputy director I was not being cooperative if I didn’t meet with him in the next couple of days. He has a quota to meet I am sure and once he established that I was still using other MSFT products he made a bunch of promises then fucked off and never followed up or fulfilled a single one.  I am not important enough for him to give a shit about, which was the impression he clearly wanted to leave me with. And then there are the small vendors who make products to meet specific niche needs of government functions.  At least they sort of know where the money spigot is… but they also know that once an agency invests in them it will be a huge effort to go anywhere else.  They are no saints either, and between them sticking with a UI that looks like it is from 2003 and the state being in an off again on again budget crisis such that it skips upgrades so we’re occasionally behind enough versions that we fall out of support or the gap between the current version and the latest version has become a forklift upgrade, the outcomes are not always ideal. So the default software project, as run by the state, is a large requirements gathering process, followed up by bids by potential vendors, contract negotiations, milestone and validation metrics, scope management agreements, roll out and maintenance plans, and so on.  The California Department of Technology has reams of process documents that need to be followed.  It can be an easy couple of years to get there for anything complicated, and it isn’t hard to find examples that went a decade from requirements gathering to being dropped in front of the end users… end users whose duties have changed because regulations have changed and departments have been reorganized and all the usual stuff.  But that just means follow on requests and more money for the vendor. In the midst of this, every so often, somebody realizes it doesn’t have to be this way and gets some budget to put together a team to make some quick apps to solve problems… and the state has plenty of problems, not the least of which is the amount of stuff still done on paper.  Forms filled out, in long hand, then scanned, turned into PDFs, stored in a digital documents archive so that if somebody needs to reference them they can maybe find them… which sometimes they can, but I took the class about the system and a good two thirds of it is how to correct the inevitable mistakes techs make in adding them to the system, a pretty good sign that things are in the wrong spot pretty often. So after a couple of months of wondering what to do with me and giving me a couple of discovery assignments for projects that were never going to go anywhere, I was grouped up with a team of four devs, a designer, and another product manager to pair with and was pointed at a paper process to be digitized.  We went to the first customer in 12 weeks, got feedback, updated the app, rolled out to more locations, and were soon a success. That was followed on by another project, this one to digitize yet another very manual paper process… end users spending ~2 hours a day filling out forms, then a supervisor for that location basically spending every Monday transcribing data from those forms into a spreadsheet to send to their supervisor, who in turn used that data to create yet another report… and to support a policy change that the governor’s office wanted documented so they could track progress. Again, we put together a very basic vision of the software, built it out, went to one location, tested with them in about 12 weeks, got feedback, expanded a bit, got things nailed down, and by the six month mark had rolled out our app state-wide, ready to meet the policy change deadline.  Our team won an award for that, which was nice, but the highest praise was from a user who said that, after 8 years working for the state, our app was the first thing to make their job easier.   Two hours of paperwork down to 15 minutes, and a report that the supervisor can just reference to report up the chain.  (I will say that we discovered another group that just does data analytics in Tableau and PowerBI, so they do all our reporting for us while we focus on accurate data collection.) I tell the team that we are living the agile dream.  We have a compact group, are free to go talk to users and design the app as we see fit, and we deliver small, usable chunks of code and respond to feedback, always making things better as we expand our feature set.  It helps that most people I have dealt with at the state are engaged and actually want to do a better job, but the force multiplier is seeing that we listen, make changes, and follow up on things. Basically, I am helping make stuff that people use.  They are narrowly focused apps and they fit into the ecosystem by drawing data from systems already in place to merge with user entries to get reporting together, and we are not changing the world, but we’re getting stuff done. The question is only how long this will last.  As I noted, this initiative was largely due to one high level champion in the organization and nobody sticks around forever.  When they move on, we shall see.  I have already had to deal with vendors insisting they can do what our apps do for just twice the cost and quadruple the time.  I’ve gotten mired in the CDT’s processes as one app we did started off as a vendor bid before we got it, so I had to take product lifecycle process in progress and somehow make the paperwork fit out tiny solution.  At least everybody was happy we spent less money that was initially budgeted. Then there is the changing nature of the state itself.  I was hired in when a lot of state tech jobs were gung-ho on work from home, so I live a 2.5-3 hour drive from the office to which I am assigned.  But the governor, under pressure from his commercial real estate donors and the mayor of Sacramento, who is in the news every week about the need to support downtown businesses, has started requiring state employees to return to the office. As it happens, the state let a lot of office space go during the work from home stage… which is what pissed off the commercial real estate people as they want the state to cut the budget, just not the part that goes into their pocket… so there is currently no place for me to sit were I to invest about 6 hours of my daily life to a commute.  But at some point that may change, and if I can’t get assigned to a desk down in here in Silicon Valley… and there are plenty of desks, but the HR people object to people not working in their assigned office, so that probably won’t fly… then they will probably try to fire me. We’ll have to see.  On the one hand, I was hired into a “telework only” position, so I might have a leg to stand on in my defense, and I joined the union (SEIU local 1000) so I might get some help there. (As an aside, I joined the union in part because there is a billionaire funded campaign to try and break the union.  Soon after I was hired I started getting letters in the mail from them with pre-filled out union withdrawal post cards that I just had to sign, the incentive given on one being that I could use those dues to go buy myself a nice new XBox.  I wasn’t even in the union at that point and was somewhat indifferent, but the campaign managed to push me into their arms.) Ideally the state will be my last job and I will retire from there.  I just need to get to the point where my wife and I qualify for Medicare coverage… if that is still a thing when I get there.  That and social security seem to be on the block for cancellation with the next administration. But things rarely go to plan and I may be out in the street again thanks to the governor’s need to please some other billionaires… these ticks feeding on the body politic are enough to turn a modest conservative into a communist agitator… in which case I hope there is an opening for a greeter at Walmart, because I have probably aged out of even retail as an employment option. Which brings me to the phone part of the story.  Since I roam around the state a bit I told my boss I needed a state phone… and he believed me and got me one.  I mean, our apps also, technically, have to scale correctly to run on phones, so it is to test apps as well. So the state grudgingly sent me a refurbed Samsung Galaxy S21, the default “important enough to get a phone, but not important enough to care which phone” model. (You need to BE somebody to get an iPhone.  Status matters even at the state.)  It was even had an old school 916 area code phone number.  If you remember the area codes post, the Sacramento area was important enough to get a 1 as the second digit, but only a 9 as the first, so a second tier location with 16 pulses to access it.  (New York City was #1 with 212, just 5 pulses.) Unfortunately, 916 was also one of the original, first batch, 1960s area codes and, as such, every possible number has been issued at least once, many of them multiple times.  So I got a number… with some history. I get 5-10 calls a week on the phone.  Maybe one is work related.  The rest are part of the… what do we even call this… the number overhang?  The shadow of past owners?  The sordid history of the number?  I used to pity the person who got my old BBS phone number, and I have felt the pain of being a digit off of the local pharmacy or the Sears appliance service center.  But I have never quite had anything like this. So now I get to hear about the ongoing saga of Maria.  Maria has some financial problems.  She gets calls from debt consolidation services at least twice a week.  No actual debt collectors, but the debt consolidation people are not a good sign, though they are always very chirpy in the messages they leave, and they ALWAYS leave a message, about how Maria has qualified for this program or that. Then there are the children.  Won’t somebody think of the children? Or at least one child, who misses class pretty regularly.  I know this because their school uses the School Messenger system… a West Corporation acquisition out here in Silicon Valley… we got moved into their building at one point and shared office space with them in Philippe Khan’s old Borland HQ, built on top of an ancient elf burial ground… and School Messenger has my number so calls me every time the child is absent or tardy. And then there is the security company, which is the most vexing of all.  They call me the most, always to report suspicious activity at a business in Tempe, Arizona, or San Diego, or Modesto, or some other place.  It isn’t even the same business every time. It is always the same, some underpaid security guard has cruised by and has spotted something they consider suspicious and, no doubt as required by contract, try to call the owner to report that somebody is hanging around the back of the building or that some kids are skateboarding in the parking lot or some other thing that I am not sure what the owner could even do something about short of driving over there… and isn’t that why you pay a freaking security company, to take care of that sort of trivial BS? Now, I know I can’t do anything about the debt refinance people.  Maria is on a list and they sense blood in the water and want to make things worse for their own profit.  Bad companies trying to exploit people in trouble rarely care about getting a wrong number. I also can’t really do anything about School Messenger.  Well, technically, I could.  I know a couple of people who could actually take my number off the list… but I don’t know the right number to call, so that wouldn’t be good as I couldn’t close the loop. But the security company, they I figured had at least some sort of vested interest in calling the right freaking phone number to at least demonstrate to their paying client that the company is on the job and watching the business or whatever. I figured wrong.  They could not care in the least that they have the wrong number.  I have been on the phone with them a few times trying to explain the situation.  They don’t give a shit at all.  On every call, the first thing they want to do is get all my information.  They want my name, address, alternate phone, email, etc.  I politely explain to the indifferent person answering the phone that they have no need for that.  All they need to know is that I am the owner of the phone number they keep calling, and none of the businesses they are reporting on are mine. The fault in the concept of calling to report things to somebody with whom they do not have a financial relationship seems completely lost on them.  All they need to do, I explain, is look up which client has the number from which I am calling and contact them in some other way in order to get them to update their phone number. I might as well be speaking on tongues for all the good it does. I made sure the outgoing message on my voice mail announces that this is an information services office of the State of California in the faint hope of somebody noticing, but they don’t care.  Somebody working at the state could potentially own a business.  I work with somebody who also owns a restaurant.  Who knows? Fortunately their calls all show up from the same number, so I was able to block the number… sort of.  My phone/calling plan doesn’t actually block numbers, it just pushes them straight to voice mail, where the security guard calling ignores the outgoing message and reports in on somebody putting trash in the dumpster in the middle of the night. So it goes.  I am out of the telephony game… save for the fact that the apps I make need to run on a phone… and we kind of fake that by doing them as progressive web apps.  I don’t make actual mobile apps.  Ideally, this initiative will last long enough for me to retire from the state in maybe 2032.  But the exec who was driving it has been promoted, the various vendor factions still want to crush us and take or relatively tiny budget, and when was the last time anything I did persist for even five years?  My career has been an ongoing series of “do something pretty different” every 2-4 years. Anyway, I have one more post in me for this series, something in the dreaded summary/wrapping up category most likely, something to try to pull together the disparate tendrils of the story into something like a unified arc.  Could be 500 words.  Could be 5,000.  We will see when I get there.

could cite work experience that aligned with the requirements of the position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell, I was golden on experience.  This group was going to use agile methodology, paired programming, and test driven development to make cloud based web apps for the state.  I could honestly say I was working with all of that at that very moment, still being in the period between notification and my actual termination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not explain that my experience at West with those things were, if not an abject failure, then certainly never going to be used as a textbook example of success.  West wanted to say it had those things, but wasn’t willing to commit fully to getting there.  Yes, we got a couple SAFe agile courses and we had an agile coach for a few months who got paid to tell us to color only within specific lines and would not allow that any specific situation might not be fully covered by the world view he was paid to espouse.  I find this map of the “agile landscape” useful in reminding me that anybody who has a religious fervor about one particular model is a heretic to somebody else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv

id=\"caption-attachment-125137\"\u003eThe Deloitte Agile Landscape map from… 2019 I think…\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was also very much the “those who cannot do, teach” feeling to our coach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the devs just straight up revolted against test driven development and paired programming.  We worked across remote offices and would soon all be working from home and nobody wanted to sit on Zoom or whatever… West had picked Cisco Teams as its platform despite owning a competitor, InterCall, for more than a dozen years at that point… so the pairing aspect never flew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Side note: During the pandemic they did try to make us use InterCall’s competitor to Zoom, called Hoot, which basically didn’t work very well, a problem with a lot of InterCall’s stuff at that point, they having focused on costs rather than new business for all those years.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasically, West wanted everybody to “Just Do It!” as Nike would say, without anybody delaying any project by even a minute, which was too much of an ask.  Adopting a new work style like paired programming is an effort, and for a month or two, until you find the balance, it is exhausting and feels counter-productive and it is often easy to slip into just one person doing the work if the pair is just getting sick of it.  And test driven development… well, I know somebody must have made that work, but to this day I haven’t seen it fully adopted.  How to even write those tests is a whole new mental model that takes time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I had experience with all those things and could talk about them in some depth.  I was happy that I wasn’t pressed very hard on how successful the effort had been.  (I wouldn’t have hidden it.  Knowing the breaks is useful too, and I could have sold that, but you never know how that is going to land.  Some people only want to hire staff that claims they hit a home run at every at bat.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, the interview went well.  They said a position would be opening up on the state site and that, once it was up I should apply for it and take the test for the position and then they would start in on the hiring process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf that sounds easy, let me assure you that getting hired by the state is not a trivial hurdle.  They have a whole automated web site for it and if you get annoyed when a company asks you to upload your resume then turns around and asks you to basically type it all in again… well, they haven’t got anything on the state.  I spent a week in December doing all that and taking “the test” which is essentially a third run at entering your resume again, but this time with feeling and anecdotes and justifications about why you should be hired.  It is a cover letter, resume, and interview all in one, which starts to feel redundant when you also have to provide a resume (and the type it in again), a cover letter, and do interviews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of this is similar to the current state of the great wall of HR at many corporations, but there are also signs that you are entering the government employment zone.  That includes the need to speak about salaries in increments of one month.  The various levels of government like to do payroll just once a month.  This, in and of itself is just a thing, but in the outside world companies have fixed on an every other week, 26 paychecks a year payroll system, so I knew what I was getting paid at various jobs in a paycheck level, or an hourly level for the stints as a contractor, but there was a bit of math that I kept having to do to the relay and compare what I was getting paid before and what compensation was being offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, based on my experience I expected to get hired above minimum, which requires a whole additional set of forms and justifications and at one point I had to demonstrate my knowledge of Microsoft Office products because that is important to the state!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe state is setup to hire somebody at the minimum and then train them up into higher levels, a pleasant contrast to Silicon Valley where the current hiring meta is to only bring on people who can produce value on day one and the idea of training anybody is viewed as absurd.  That is a big change from the 90s when the valley was so hungry for talent.  But then, they hadn’t discovered H1-B visas yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all that and interviews and approvals and validations and having to fill out a stunning number of forms… a good portion of which wanted to know if I was a veteran because the state makes a big effort to hire veterans, so when you demand cuts to the government workforce, you are often hitting veterans directly… I was finally given an offer to start roughly six months after the first phone call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the mean time I had applied for a bunch of jobs as a backup plan, and actually had a couple good interviews with LinkedIn for a position that sounded almost tailored for my skill set and background before they decided against me.  The irony was that LinkedIn was also a painful place to apply for jobs and I am pretty sure there is now a special place in Hell for recruiters there who blow smoke up your ass then ghost you.  I’ve heard the excuses, you’re still a bad person if you do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was taking a bit of a pay cut from my last job, which wasn’t exactly offering a competitive Silicon Valley salary, another reason I was looking the whole time I was there, but the benefits package was excellent and so much cheaper that in the end, when you did the payroll conversion, my take home pay was a bit more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich leads me to what I do for the state and how software development even works when it comes to government projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst off, the state has some rules about social media and posting online, so I will at this point make it clear that everything here is my opinion and that I do not in any way represent the State of California or any of its agencies.  I just work there as a rank and file member of state staff and do not have any role in policy, procurement, or related purchasing decisions.  I just try to make stuff with the tools provided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a school of thought out there that says no government should make things or in anyway produce something that would compete with private industry in and possible way.  And there is some justification for that.  You can look around the world or at our own history and find examples of government agencies running businesses poorly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem is that here, in the US, that philosophy has been taken to its extreme by the billionaires and huge corporations.  Those that complain the most vociferously about taxes and government waste also just happen to be the recipients of huge amounts of taxpayer largess.  And it isn’t just Elon Musk, whose fortunes and companies would vanish in a fortnight if it wasn’t for government programs, whose hypocrisy about government spending stands out.  Seriously, government programs get cancelled for him and he would be the CEO of a pile of companies headed into bankruptcy.  So when he is talking about the Department of Government Efficiency, the only efficiency he wants is in the form of tax dollars into his pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe always hear about military contracts and $10,000 toilet seats, but this goes through and through all the way down to your local city or town.  Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, and SAP make huge amounts of money from government contracts.  The all have divisions dedicated to separating as many tax payer dollars from the government as possible.  And they all put pressure on governments to upgrade and adopt whatever they are pushing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I was a bit surprised to show up at the state and find the place pretty much run by Microsoft products.  I was suffering from a bit of 90s Microsoft anti-trust hangover I guess, when states were suing the pirates in Redmond.  We all got over that I guess and now shovel piles of cash into their corporate maw.  And those titans fight over their huge slices of the government pie.  I chose a Salesforce product at one point and was warned that the Microsoft faction was trying to eliminate that and even got a visit from our Microsoft rep who basically threatened to tell the deputy director I was not being cooperative if I didn’t meet with him in the next couple of days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe has a quota to meet I am sure and once he established that I was still using other MSFT products he made a bunch of promises then fucked off and never followed up or fulfilled a single one.  I am not important enough for him to give a shit about, which was the impression he clearly wanted to leave me with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there are the small vendors who make products to meet specific niche needs of government functions.  At least they sort of know where the money spigot is… but they also know that once an agency invests in them it will be a huge effort to go anywhere else.  They are no saints either, and between them sticking with a UI that looks like it is from 2003 and the state being in an off again on again budget crisis such that it skips upgrades so we’re occasionally behind enough versions that we fall out of support or the gap between the current version and the latest version has become a forklift upgrade, the outcomes are not always ideal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the default software project, as run by the state, is a large requirements gathering process, followed up by bids by potential vendors, contract negotiations, milestone and validation metrics, scope management agreements, roll out and maintenance plans, and so on.  The California Department of Technology has reams of process documents that need to be followed.  It can be an easy couple of years to get there for anything complicated, and it isn’t hard to find examples that went a decade from requirements gathering to being dropped in front of the end users… end users whose duties have changed because regulations have changed and departments have been reorganized and all the usual stuff.  But that just means follow on requests and more money for the vendor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the midst of this, every so often, somebody realizes it doesn’t have to be this way and gets some budget to put together a team to make some quick apps to solve problems… and the state has plenty of problems, not the least of which is the amount of stuff still done on paper.  Forms filled out, in long hand, then scanned, turned into PDFs, stored in a digital documents archive so that if somebody needs to reference them they can maybe find them… which sometimes they can, but I took the class about the system and a good two thirds of it is how to correct the inevitable mistakes techs make in adding them to the system, a pretty good sign that things are in the wrong spot pretty often.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo after a couple of months of wondering what to do with me and giving me a couple of discovery assignments for projects that were never going to go anywhere, I was grouped up with a team of four devs, a designer, and another product manager to pair with and was pointed at a paper process to be digitized.  We went to the first customer in 12 weeks, got feedback, updated the app, rolled out to more locations, and were soon a success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was followed on by another project, this one to digitize yet another very manual paper process… end users spending ~2 hours a day filling out forms, then a supervisor for that location basically spending every Monday transcribing data from those forms into a spreadsheet to send to their supervisor, who in turn used that data to create yet another report… and to support a policy change that the governor’s office wanted documented so they could track progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, we put together a very basic vision of the software, built it out, went to one location, tested with them in about 12 weeks, got feedback, expanded a bit, got things nailed down, and by the six month mark had rolled out our app state-wide, ready to meet the policy change deadline.  Our team won an award for that, which was nice, but the highest praise was from a user who said that, after 8 years working for the state, our app was the first thing to make their job easier.   Two hours of paperwork down to 15 minutes, and a report that the supervisor can just reference to report up the chain.  (I will say that we discovered another group that just does data analytics in Tableau and PowerBI, so they do all our reporting for us while we focus on accurate data collection.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tell the team that we are living the agile dream.  We have a compact group, are free to go talk to users and design the app as we see fit, and we deliver small, usable chunks of code and respond to feedback, always making things better as we expand our feature set.  It helps that most people I have dealt with at the state are engaged and actually want to do a better job, but the force multiplier is seeing that we listen, make changes, and follow up on things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasically, I am helping make stuff that people use.  They are narrowly focused apps and they fit into the ecosystem by drawing data from systems already in place to merge with user entries to get reporting together, and we are not changing the world, but we’re getting stuff done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question is only how long this will last.  As I noted, this initiative was largely due to one high level champion in the organization and nobody sticks around forever.  When they move on, we shall see.  I have already had to deal with vendors insisting they can do what our apps do for just twice the cost and quadruple the time.  I’ve gotten mired in the CDT’s processes as one app we did started off as a vendor bid before we got it, so I had to take product lifecycle process in progress and somehow make the paperwork fit out tiny solution.  At least everybody was happy we spent less money that was initially budgeted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there is the changing nature of the state itself.  I was hired in when a lot of state tech jobs were gung-ho on work from home, so I live a 2.5-3 hour drive from the office to which I am assigned.  But the governor, under pressure from his commercial real estate donors and the mayor of Sacramento, who is in the news every week about the need to support downtown businesses, has started requiring state employees to return to the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it happens, the state let a lot of office space go during the work from home stage… which is what pissed off the commercial real estate people as they want the state to cut the budget, just not the part that goes into their pocket… so there is currently no place for me to sit were I to invest about 6 hours of my daily life to a commute.  But at some point that may change, and if I can’t get assigned to a desk down in here in Silicon Valley… and there are plenty of desks, but the HR people object to people not working in their assigned office, so that probably won’t fly… then they will probably try to fire me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ll have to see.  On the one hand, I was hired into a “telework only” position, so I might have a leg to stand on in my defense, and I joined the union (SEIU local 1000) so I might get some help there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(As an aside, I joined the union in part because there is a billionaire funded campaign to try and break the union.  Soon after I was hired I started getting letters in the mail from them with pre-filled out union withdrawal post cards that I just had to sign, the incentive given on one being that I could use those dues to go buy myself a nice new XBox.  I wasn’t even in the union at that point and was somewhat indifferent, but the campaign managed to push me into their arms.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdeally the state will be my last job and I will retire from there.  I just need to get to the point where my wife and I qualify for Medicare coverage… if that is still a thing when I get there.  That and social security seem to be on the block for cancellation with the next administration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut things rarely go to plan and I may be out in the street again thanks to the governor’s need to please some other billionaires… these ticks feeding on the body politic are enough to turn a modest conservative into a communist agitator… in which case I hope there is an opening for a greeter at Walmart, because I have probably aged out of even retail as an employment option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich brings me to the phone part of the story.  Since I roam around the state a bit I told my boss I needed a state phone… and he believed me and got me one.  I mean, our apps also, technically, have to scale correctly to run on phones, so it is to test apps as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the state grudgingly sent me a refurbed Samsung Galaxy S21, the default “important enough to get a phone, but not important enough to care which phone” model. (You need to BE somebody to get an iPhone.  Status matters even at the state.)  It was even had an old school 916 area code phone number.  If you remember \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2023/08/27/what-your-area-code-used-to-say-about-your-location/\"\u003ethe area codes post\u003c/a\u003e, the Sacramento area was important enough to get a 1 as the second digit, but only a 9 as the first, so a second tier location with 16 pulses to access it.  (New York City was #1 with 212, just 5 pulses.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, 916 was also one of the original, first batch, 1960s area codes and, as such, every possible number has been issued at least once, many of them multiple times.  So I got a number… with some history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get 5-10 calls a week on the phone.  Maybe one is work related.  The rest are part of the… what do we even call this… the number overhang?  The shadow of past owners?  The sordid history of the number?  I used to pity the person who got my old BBS phone number, and I have felt the pain of being a digit off of the local pharmacy or the Sears appliance service center.  But I have never quite had anything like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now I get to hear about the ongoing saga of Maria.  Maria has some financial problems.  She gets calls from debt consolidation services at least twice a week.  No actual debt collectors, but the debt consolidation people are not a good sign, though they are always very chirpy in the messages they leave, and they ALWAYS leave a message, about how Maria has qualified for this program or that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there are the children.  Won’t somebody think of the children?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr at least one child, who misses class pretty regularly.  I know this because their school uses the School Messenger system… a West Corporation acquisition out here in Silicon Valley… we got moved into their building at one point and shared office space with them in Philippe Khan’s old Borland HQ, built on top of an \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa%27s_Village_(Scotts_Valley)\"\u003eancient elf burial ground\u003c/a\u003e… and School Messenger has my number so calls me every time the child is absent or tardy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there is the security company, which is the most vexing of all.  They call me the most, always to report suspicious activity at a business in Tempe, Arizona, or San Diego, or Modesto, or some other place.  It isn’t even the same business every time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is always the same, some underpaid security guard has cruised by and has spotted something they consider suspicious and, no doubt as required by contract, try to call the owner to report that somebody is hanging around the back of the building or that some kids are skateboarding in the parking lot or some other thing that I am not sure what the owner could even do something about short of driving over there… and isn’t that why you pay a freaking security company, to take care of that sort of trivial BS?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, I know I can’t do anything about the debt refinance people.  Maria is on a list and they sense blood in the water and want to make things worse for their own profit.  Bad companies trying to exploit people in trouble rarely care about getting a wrong number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also can’t really do anything about School Messenger.  Well, technically, I could.  I know a couple of people who could actually take my number off the list… but I don’t know the right number to call, so that wouldn’t be good as I couldn’t close the loop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the security company, they I figured had at least some sort of vested interest in calling the right freaking phone number to at least demonstrate to their paying client that the company is on the job and watching the business or whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI figured wrong.  They could not care in the least that they have the wrong number.  I have been on the phone with them a few times trying to explain the situation.  They don’t give a shit at all.  On every call, the first thing they want to do is get all my information.  They want my name, address, alternate phone, email, etc.  I politely explain to the indifferent person answering the phone that they have no need for that.  All they need to know is that I am the owner of the phone number they keep calling, and none of the businesses they are reporting on are mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fault in the concept of calling to report things to somebody with whom they do not have a financial relationship seems completely lost on them.  All they need to do, I explain, is look up which client has the number from which I am calling and contact them in some other way in order to get them to update their phone number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI might as well be speaking on tongues for all the good it does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made sure the outgoing message on my voice mail announces that this is an information services office of the State of California in the faint hope of somebody noticing, but they don’t care.  Somebody working at the state could potentially own a business.  I work with somebody who also owns a restaurant.  Who knows?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately their calls all show up from the same number, so I was able to block the number… sort of.  My phone/calling plan doesn’t actually block numbers, it just pushes them straight to voice mail, where the security guard calling ignores the

the apps I make need to run on a phone… and we kind of fake that by doing them as \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app\"\u003eprogressive web apps\u003c/a\u003e.  I don’t make actual mobile apps.  Ideally, this initiative will last long enough for me to retire from the state in maybe 2032.  But the exec who was driving it has been promoted, the various vendor factions still want to crush us and take or relatively tiny budget, and when was the last time anything I did persist for even five years?  My career has been an ongoing series of “do something pretty different” every 2-4 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I have one more post in me for this series, something in the dreaded summary/wrapping up category most likely, something to try to pull together the disparate tendrils of the story into something like a unified arc.  Could be 500 words.  Could be 5,000.  We will see when I get there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2023/07/19/hanging-on-the-telephone/\" rel=\"bookmark\"\u003eHanging on
