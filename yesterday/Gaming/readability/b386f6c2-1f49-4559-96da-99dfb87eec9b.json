Enad Global 7 Remember in past posts where I explained how acquisitions are often a cheap way to get a revenue boost quickly?  Well, Daybreak scooping up Singularity 6, the makers of cozy MMO Palia, paid off in that they got to claim the revenue while the transaction was earnings neutral. That put Daybreak, which had been slipping on the margins front, back at the top of the EG7 studios as Big Blue Bubble’s My Singing Monsters reign continued to taper off… though their margins are still pretty monster, being nearly double Daybreak’s EG7 – Q3 2024 Presentation – Slide 6 Revenue was also driven by LOTRO and its legendary server launch, which got some players back into the fold, and EverQuest and its 25th anniversary celebrations, which gave EG7 its best quarter this year. Related links: EG7 – Investor Relations page EG7 – Q3 2024 Interim Report EG7 – Q3 2024 Investor Presentation Massively OP – EG7 Q3 2024 As for things coming up, they appear to be prepping Palia and its cash shop model for an exit from beta and a console launch while the promised H1Z1 title, mentioned last year at the fall 2023 Stockholm Syndrome presentation, got no mention on the slide deck and is listed as “Currently in pre-production phase” in the interim report.  Not sure what that really means, but it could still be on for 2026.  And then there is the next EverQuest title, slated for 2028 on the chart from EG7. The future milestone for EG7 releases There have been some leaks around work starting on a new Norrath title, but nothing substantial and we are still a few years out. Pearl Abyss Primarily of interest to me as the owners of CCP, the studio responsible for EVE Online, the Q3 numbers overall were down across the board… across the board being just the Black Desert and EVE Online IPs, PA having continued to fail to launch anything else. Pearly Abyss – Investor Presentation – Page 6 While EVE Online was down compared to Q2, it was not by that much and it remains up relative to the three quarters before that, Q1 and Q4 \u0026 Q3 of 2023.  Again, the EVE IP isn’t broken out into detail, and there is no doubt some EVE Echoes licensing revenue coming in from NetEase, but that seems likely to be mostly EVE Online. Related links: Pearl Abyss – Q3 2024 Earnings Presentation TNG – Pearl Abyss Q3 2024 Earnings Call Massively OP – Pearl Abyss Q3 2024 The forward looking “growth strategy” in the presentation leans heavily on EVE Online’s Revenant expansion, the recently launched EVE: Galaxy Conquest, the now mythical Crimson Desert launch, and the garbage cryto dumpster fire that is EVE Frontier. You tell me if any of that is a good bet. That is all of two bullet points.  I thought about going into NCsoft’s Q3 2024 revenue, but I had even less to say about that, save for the fact that the Guild Wars 2 Janthir Wilds expansion didn’t exactly peg the revenue meter.  Was the player housing not good enough?  Were you not entertained? Still, they have Throne \u0026 Liberty revenue to look forward to. In any case, Q4 and the holidays and the full year revenue pictures are generally more entertaining.  And I don’t even have to think about that until February of 2025.",

2024\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forward looking “growth strategy” in the presentation leans heavily on \u003cem\u003eEVE Online’s Revenant\u003c/em\u003e expansion, the recently launched \u003cem\u003eEVE: Galaxy Conquest\u003c/em\u003e, the now mythical \u003cem\u003eCrimson Desert\u003c/em\u003e launch, and the garbage cryto dumpster fire that is \u003cem\u003eEVE Frontier\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou tell me if any of that is a good bet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is all of two bullet points.  I thought about going into \u003ca href=\"https://massivelyop.com/2024/11/12/ncsoft-q3-2024-ncsoft-teases-aion-2-for-2025-says-throne-liberty-sales-surpassed-internal-projections/\"\u003eNCsoft’s Q3 2024 revenue\u003c/a\u003e, but I had even less to say about that, save for the fact that the \u003cem\u003eGuild Wars 2 Janthir Wilds\u003c/em\u003e expansion didn’t exactly peg the revenue meter.  Was the player housing not good enough?  Were you not entertained?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, they have \u003cem\u003eThrone \u0026amp; Liberty\u003c/em\u003e revenue to look forward to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, Q4 and the holidays and the full year revenue pictures are generally more entertaining.  And I don’t even have to think about that until February of 2025.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
