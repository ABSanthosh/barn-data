However, fellow new release M3GAN 2.0 struggled with a global debut of $17.158 million, down significantly on its predecessor.F1 The Movie, which sees Brad Pitt drive F1 cars for real at top speeds, is a rare box office hit for Apple. Indeed F1 looks set to lap Apple’s previous theatrical efforts at the box office, including Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon and Ridley Scott’s Napoleon.IGN’s F1: The Movie review returned a 7/10. We said: “F1: The Movie follows the sports movie playbook almost perfectly, finding ways to be just that much better at nearly every stage of its 156-minute runtime — creating a super fun racecar flick in the process that eventually finds its way to victory lane.”Blumhouse’s M3GAN 2.0 saw $10.2 million domestically and just $6.958 million internationally during launch weekend, which suggests the first M3GAN movie, released in December 2022, may have been a lightning in a bottle moment with its eventual $180 million global haul.IGN’s M3GAN 2.0 review saw a 6/10. We said: “M3GAN 2.0 hotswaps horror for sci-fi/action to mixed results, but M3GAN’s absolutely heinous wit and killer moves leave her, and not the new genres, the star of the show.”Meanwhile, 28 Years Later is now up to $103 million globally, the highest of the franchise, after two weekends. The live-action How To Train Your Dragon film is on an impressive $454.436 million globally. Elio, which endured the worst opening in Pixar history last weekend, continues to struggle. After two weekends it’s on just $72.3 million.Disney will be delighted with the live-action Lilo \u0026 Stitch movie, however. After just six weekends it’s grossed $946 million and remains on course to crack a billion dollars at the box office, especially with the school holidays about to kick in.And for those keeping score, Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is on $561.99 million after six weekends, Karate Kid: Legends crossed $100 million at the global box office this weekend, Final Destination Bloodlines is on $283.3 million, and Sinners hit $368 million.Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
