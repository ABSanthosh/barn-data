It combines excellent sound quality with comfortable ergonomics, a high-performance mic, and unique yet extremely practical features. One of the biggest standout features of the SteelSeries Nova Pro wireless headset is the ingenious hot-swappable battery system. SteelSeries was generous enough to includes two batteries: one that's in use in your headset and the other that's charging in the separate DAC controller. This way, you get wireless freedom with no waiting to recharge. Each battery lasts for up to 22 hours of continued use, so you won't be constantly swapping them out either.Other great features include an OLED base station with volume control knob, active noise cancellation (rare in a gaming headset), retractable boom microphone, all-day comfort thanks to the suspension headband and leatherette ear cushions, simultaneous 2.4GHz WiFi and Bluetooth pairing, onboard audio presets, and the versatile Sonar software for creating your own custom sound profiles (for PC gamers).Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
