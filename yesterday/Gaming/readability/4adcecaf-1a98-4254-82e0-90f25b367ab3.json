  "text": "SummaryLearn more about Aniimo, the creature collecting action-RPG revealed at Xbox Games Showcase. Aniimo is coming to Xbox Series X|S, Xbox on PC, and Xbox Cloud as an Xbox Play Anywhere title in 2026. Sign up for a closed beta today!  It’s been an exciting time for the whole Aniimo team as, during the Xbox Games Showcase, we were finally able to open the doors of Aniimo to players and welcome them to our passion project; an open world creature collecting action-RPG.   This is truly the game of our dreams. We’ve been focused on crafting something new and unforgettable, laying the foundations for a magnificent open world with immense potential. All of us are excited to have players join us in discovering the world of Aniimo, and getting them involved in the next step of development by sharing valuable feedback with us during an upcoming closed beta test.   If you’re keen to know more, let me break down our new game for you: The Aniimo  Thanks to Aniimo, we have discovered a fascinating bunch of creatures called, you’ve guessed it, Aniimo. These are magical beings who we are getting to know better every day.  The Aniimo have captured our curiosity, and we’re constantly learning more about them – their personalities, abilities, charm, our own emotional connections with them and how they adapt to Idyll, the world that they live in. One example is Budclaw, a shy crab-like Aniimo who is good at digging and navigating different terrains, but can’t see too well underground. That’s a good trick to know because if it hits a rock it will go dizzy and be easier to catch. Another is Nimbi, the cloud-shaped sheep who reacts to its environment, making it incredibly light and able to jump to huge heights – but who behaves very differently in thunderstorms.   This world is so rich and detailed that we’re still seeking more Aniimo out, learning about them, capturing them, battling with them, developing and evolving them, and we’re excited to be able to now have players join us on this journey of discovery.   The Gameplay  When players join us in the world of Idyll they will gradually embark on their own unique journey of exploration. This is a multiplayer game in a fully open world. Players can choose the areas they want to explore, and the narrative will be shaped by their choices. Everyone’s adventure will be different.   There are two battle modes in the game. By capturing an Aniimo you can engage in real-time battles with other Aniimo, and grow your own Aniimo’s strength and skills. But beyond having a creature with incredible abilities and powers, wouldn’t it be even better if you could experience those powers for yourself? By “twining” with the Aniimo, a spiritual connection takes place, essentially enabling us to become our chosen creature, and experience the game in a totally new way.   We can move through the world as an Aniimo, battle as an Aniimo and explore the world of Idyll through the unique features of the Aniimo we have twined with. This feature also immerses us more fully in the Aniimo’s society – the everyday exchanges and habits that the Aniimo have developed amongst themselves.  The Open World  Idyll is a huge, living world, but there are bigger reasons for travelling around it than simply to see the sights. Each Aniimo reacts to the different environments and conditions and adapts their behavior accordingly. For example, an Aniimo may be able to leverage terrain to burrow and dodge attacks, or use special vision to spot danger, which takes the discovery of the world to a whole new level.    Join the Closed Beta   This is just the beginning! We can’t wait to welcome players to Idyll and introduce you to the Aniimo! Our closed beta test will open for PC players later this summer and more information on how to participate can be found here. Aniimo is a next-gen open-world creature-catching ARPG set to launch in 2026.",
