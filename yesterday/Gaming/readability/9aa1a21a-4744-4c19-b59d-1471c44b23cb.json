Nintendo's legendary action-adventure franchise has seen over 25 mainline games and a handful of great spinoffs, and if you own a Nintendo Switch and subscribe to their online service, you have access to just about every single Zelda title to date. But the green-clad Hero of Time transcends just video games, so we've put together a gift guide for that special Zelda fan in your life. From the video games and controllers, books to apparel, and even an amazing LEGO Deku Tree set, there's quite literally something for both new and old Legend of Zelda fans alike. Legend of Zelda Video GamesWith the Nintendo Switch 2 just around the corner and both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom receiving performance upgrades, you can still pick up two of the best games the system still has to offer. And if you're waiting a bit to pick up the Switch 2, there are still plenty of other Legend of Zelda games to keep you occupied. Skyward Sword HD and the Link's Awakening remake are the best ways to revisit these older titles, while Echoes of Wisdom finally allows players to take control of Zelda. The first two Hyrule Warriors titles are incredibly fun action games, so be sure to check them out before Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment releases on Nintendo Switch 2.Legend of Zelda Controllers and AccessoriesNow what if you already have all these Legend of Zelda games, what are you supposed to play them with to show your support of the franchise? Luckily there are tons of great Zelda-themed controllers and accessories to deck your system out with. From official Zelda Joy-Con (I have Skyward Sword HD set, they look incredible!) and pro controllers to third-party Nintendo Switch dock covers, you'll be sprucing up your game room setup in no time.For more things like this without the Zelda theme, you can check out our guide to the best Switch accessories.Legend of Zelda EncyclopediasLegend of Zelda MangaThere are an impressive amount of Legend of Zelda manga and encyclopedias that look great a shelf or coffee table. We put together a breakdown of all the Zelda books you should know about, like the wide breadth of manga covering the games from the Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and even both Oracles of Ages and Oracle of Seasons. The encyclopedias are great collectibles for any Zelda fan, as they offer closer looks at the lore and history of Hyrule, complete with old concept art and sketches. Legend of Zelda Puzzles, Cards, and Board GamesThere are tons of great jigsaw puzzles for adults, and the Legend of Zelda-themed puzzles are among our favorite. The 1.000-piece Hyrule map puzzle would look right at home framed over a fireplace once complete. You can also find a handful of classic board games with a Legend of Zelda skin, such as the Monopoly Legend of Zelda Collector's Edition or Legend of Zelda Uno. Also, be sure to have a look at the official Zelda playing cards (these are Japanese imports only!). LEGO Great Deku Tree SetLEGO Great Deku Tree SetSet #77092, includes 2,500 pieces. This 2-in-1 set lets you build the Great Deku Tree in the style of Ocarina of Time or Breath of the Wild with the same pieces.Other Nintendo properties, like Super Mario and Animal Crossing, are no strangers to getting the LEGO treatment, and the massive Great Deku Tree set is one of the best LEGO has to offer. The over 2,500-piece set has a 2-in-1 modular function, allowing you to build either the Breath of the Wild or Ocarina of Time Great Deku Trees. It comes with four minifigures: Princess Zelda and three different versions of Link - Breath of the Wild's Link and both young and adult Link from Ocarina of Time. It also comes with detailed Master Sword and Hylian Shield pieces and a buildable Hestu figure. Legend of Zelda Amiibo and Action FiguresThere are dozens upon dozens of available Nintendo Amiibo figures, and the Legend of Zelda characters make up a healthy chunk of them. You can scan these figures on your Nintendo Switch system to unlock different features in various Nintendo Games. Check out our breakdown of every Legend of Zelda Amiibo. You can also grab a couple of Legend of Zelda action figures from the IGN store, like super detailed Zelda and Ganondorf Figma action figures from Tears of the Kingdom. Legend of Zelda ApparelAlso available on the IGN store are tons a great Legend of Zelda apparel items. T-shirts, hoodies, and crew necks all with sweet Legend of Zelda designs are available in various sizes. The designs vary from retro pixel art to stylized images of classic scenes from throughout the series' entire history. I'm a big fan fan of the Wind Waker stained glass crew neck, myself. Legend of Zelda Replica Weapons, Drinkware, Vinyl RecordsEverything listed here is just scratching the surface of the awesome collectibles and items you can get with a Legend of Zelda theme tacked onto it. On the IGN store, you can pick up a replica Master Sword and Hylian Shield, great for future cosplays or game room displays. I highly recommend the 2LP vinyl record set from iam8bit which include a collection of the some of the series' best tracks. On Amazon, you can find an array of Zelda memorobilia like mugs, thermoses, and coasters. You can even buy a working ceramic ocarina!Myles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.
