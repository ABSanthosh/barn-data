  "description": "My sweet MBB, Goodness gracious, you are 18 today. I can’t believe it, but yet I can. We’ve been together so long, haven’t we? I know that this year was kind of a challenging one for us. Between me not feeling like my usual self and struggling with some health things, we haven’t been spending a lot of time together, not like we used to. I want you to know, though, that I am still here, and that I still love you very much. I will always be so very proud of you and everything we’ve accomplished together. What’s in store for us this next year? I don’t know, but I have a feeling that it’s going to be a year full of love, growth and adventure.
