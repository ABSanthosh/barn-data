If you're looking for an easy solution to add great sound to your home, then you've probably already heard of Sonos. Sonos speakers are very easy to set up, don't take a large amount of space, and most importantly, offer distortion-free room-filling audio. They're not cheap, so it's a wise investment to jump on a deal when you see one.Sonos' Black Friday sale is better than the few other sales sprinkled throughout the year for two main reasons: 1) the discounts are bigger, with some prices at historical lows, and 2) nearly its entire lineup of speakers, soundbars, and headphones are on sale instead of just a small selection.Best Sonos Deals for Black Friday 2024Sonos ArcSonos ArcThe Arc is Sonos' flagship product. We rated it the best soundbar of 2024. This is a premium soundbar and it shows. This 45\" soundbar houses 11 precisely engineered internal speakers, including two dedicated height channels. It's Dolby Atmos ready, and there's enough power here that you can probably get away without a subwoofer. However, the Sonos Arc can be wirelessly paired up with other Sonos speakers and subs to add even more sound distribution. The Arc also has a built-in microphone for voice control so it is Alexa and Google Assistant compatible.Sonos Beam Gen 2Sonos Beam Gen 2If your TV is too small for the Arc's 45\" footprint, the consider the Sonos Beam instead. The Beam is a smaller 26\" soundbar that still boasts excellent audio quality thanks to four elliptical midwoofers, one central tweeter and three passive bass radiators. It's Dolby Atmos ready and has a mic for voice control.Sonos RaySonos RayThanks to its diminutive 22\" length, the Sonos Ray soundbar fits just about anywhere with just about any size TV. Despite its compact size, it still pumps out room-filling audio with its two tweeters and two woofers. The Sonos Ray has built-in Wi-Fi so it can double up as a home audio speaker through the Sonos app, Apple AirPlay 2, Spotify Connect, and more. Note that the Sonos Ray does not have built-in smart functionality.Sonos Sub Mini \u0026 Sub 4Sonos Sub MiniSonos Sub 4If you want to add ground-shaking bass to your Sonos setup, there's still nothing better than a separate standalone subwoofer. Despite its compact size, the Sonos Sub Mini boasts two 6\" drivers that face inwards towards each other in a sealed enclosure to eliminate unwanted vibrations. Each driver is powered by its own Class D digital amplifier and delivers more than enough sound pressure for even a large room. The Sonos Sub Mini maintains a small footprint and it looks good.The Sub 4 offers even more power in the form of two 5\"x8\" woofers housed in a larger enclosure. Unlike the Sonos Mini which uses a sealed design, the Sub 4 is ported for a louder, deeper low-end.Sonos Roam 2Sonos Roam 2The Sonos Roam 2 is a compact, portable speaker that's designed for both indoor and outdoor use. To that effect, it has a rugged IP67 waterproof and dustproof housing and weighs in at under a pound. The internal battery supplies the Roam 2 with nearly 10 hours of playtime on a single charge. It supports both Bluetooth and wireless and the presence of an internal mic means it is Amazon Alexa compatible.Sonos Era 100 and 300Sonos Era 100Sonos Era 300The Sonos Era 100 is a direct successor to the Sonos One. Sound quality is equivalent to a Sonos Move, which isn't surprising considering they have similar internal components: two tweeters, a mid-woofer, and three class-D digital amps. The Era 100 also supports Dolby Atmos when it is paired with an Arc or Beam soundbar. It has a built-in microphone and can be voice controlled; it can also be used as a smart speaker for both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.The Era 300 is a much larger and better sounding speaker. It has four tweeters and two woofers (double the Era 100), which makes it great for spatial audio. Unlike the Era 100, it supports Dolby Atmos content.Sonos Move 2Sonos Move 2The Move is Sonos' biggest and best portable speaker. Thinks of it as a portable Era 100. This is a standalone speaker with a self-contained battery and can be carried around from room to room. It's also made of more durable materials and is IP56 rated for weather resistance and a small dock is also included. The Move 2 pumps out great sound for its small footprint. Like the Era 100, the Move 2 has two tweeters, three class-D digital amplifiers, a mid-woofer. It also has a built-in microphone for voice control so it is Alexa and Google Assistant compatible.Sonos AceSonos AceThe Sonos Ace is Sonos' first headphone and it delivers on all fronts. It offers superb sound quality and excellent noise cancellation, it's comfortable to wear for long periods of time, and it looks pretty stylish as far as headphones go. The only knock on it is the price, since it's more expensive than the popular Bose QuietComfort Ultra or Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones. But that's why you get it on Black Friday, when it's $100 off.Are Sonos Amps on sale for Black Friday?At this time, we're not seeing any live deals on Sonos Amps. They are already low in stock at Amazon and Best Buy. Check back throughout the weekend and come Cyber Monday here for an update. You can get the full-priced Sonos Amp on Best Buy at $699 or on Amazon for the same price.Why is Sonos so popular?Sound quality vs. sizeDespite the fact that Sonos products are compact and don't take up much space in your house, they offer surprisingly loud and distortion-free audio. They're definitely pricier than budget options, but the sound quality is more akin to audio products that cost hundreds more or take up much more space.Easy setupSonos devices are usually simple plug and play. All you have to do is plug in a power cable (if even that's necessary) and one connection to your TV (if even that's necessary), download the Sonos app, and you're done. Generally a receiver isn't required; the soundbars are designed to plug right into your TV and the speakers are designed to work wirelessly. For something like a 5.1ch home theater setup, you don't have to deal with a mess of cables. Individual Sonos speakers can pair with your soundbar and be used as rear satellites, and the subwoofer is also wireless so it can be positioned virtually anywhere in your room.Communication between devicesPractically all Sonos speakers can communicate with each other. That means you can pair different Sonos speakers in different rooms for multi-room capability. Or you can pair two speakers for stereo output. Or you can pair speakers to your soundbar to be used as a 5.1ch setup. It's all seamlessly done through the app.Black Friday Headphone DealsCheck out all the other best headphone deals for Black Friday from other brands right now including Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones for Under $200 at Amazon. And, if you're open to earbuds instead of headphones, Apple's AirPods are selling like crazy right now with AirPods Pro big deal right now.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
