  "text": "\"We found it's better to provide marketing materials close to the release window to create excitement.\" Image credit: Rockstar Take-Two Interactive boss Strauss Zelnick has revealed why the publisher is keeping Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto 6's release date such a closely guarded secret. In an interview with Bloomberg, Zelnick acknowledged the fervor for GTA 6 is \"the greatest anticipation [he's] ever seen for an entertainment property\", but said that whilst some publishers reveal their publishing plans \"years in advance\", Zelnick would prefer to \"maintain the anticipation and excitement\". Newscast: Xbox currently has more first-party games coming to PlayStation 5 this year than Sony Xbox currently has more first-party games coming to PlayStation 5 this year than Sony.Watch on YouTube \"The anticipation for that title may be the greatest anticipation I've ever seen for an entertainment property, and I've been around the block a few times,\" Zelnick explained right at the end of the interview. \"I've been in every entertainment business there is, and we want to maintain the anticipation and the excitement. \"We do have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance, and we found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand, and balance the excitement with unmet anticipation,\" he added. \"I don't always get it exactly right, but that's what we're trying to do.\" As Matt recently summarised for us, Take-Two has been doggedly sticking to the same non-specific \"fall\" launch window for Grand Theft Auto 6 since announcing it last May - despite persistent reports of a potential delay. But there seems to be one relatively safe spot on the 2025 calendar right now: it's unlikely GTA 6 will release on or during the weeks surrounding 23rd September, given that's the launch date Take-Two reserved for Borderlands 4 earlier this year.",
