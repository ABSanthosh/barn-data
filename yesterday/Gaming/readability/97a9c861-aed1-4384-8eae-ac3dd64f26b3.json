  "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Pick how much ice you’d like in your drink: all the way to the brim, half full, a few cubes or no ice at all? Half full, please. That’s purr-fect! 2. Have you ever raised a puppy or a kitten? Yes. It’s a wonderful experience, but be prepared to have your nice things destroyed! Oh, and you can forget about your couch ever looking pristine again. 3. How often do you hit the snooze button in the morning? Just once. I used to just get up when the alarm went right off, but lately, eh, I’ve been loving a little extra sleep. 4. What decade has the best clothes? I’m probably biased because I wish I could go back to 1998 at least once a day, but[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 877 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

What decade has the best clothes? I’m probably biased because I wish I could go back to 1998 at least once a day, but I think the ‘90s had some great clothes. Everything I had wasn’t too tight or too itchy, and the quality seemed to be made better overall. The other day El Hub and I spent an inordinate amount of time talking about how the socks in the ‘90s were better, but I swear they lasted longer. Nowadays, I feel like I’m buying new socks every six months. 5. What decade has the best music: ‘70s, ‘80s’, ‘90s or 2000s? Oh boy, don’t make me choose! I guess overall I’d go with ‘80s music. I can always find something I like from that era. Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S. Here are the questions to copy/paste with your answers in a comment. Talk to ya soon. 1.
