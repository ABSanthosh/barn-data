  "text": "Image credit: Alamo Drafthouse Sucker Punch's upcoming PlayStation 5 exclusive Ghost of Yōtei is getting its own official popcorn bucket, but it's proven so popular it has already sold out online. The bucket itself was available to pre-order from AlamoMart, and is shaped like a traditional Japanese rice basket. It was released for pre-order to coincide with Alamo Drafthouse's \"curated\" Way of the Samurai film programme, which will showcase five films that helped define the genre. This series of films will be hosted in August at select Alamo Drafthouse theaters. Ghost of Yotei Just Sold Me on a PS5 Pro and Frankly, I'm Furious Ghost of Yotei Just Sold Me on a PS5 Pro and Frankly, I'm Furious. Watch on YouTube Anyway, the hand painted Ghost of Yōtei Popcorn Bucket, as it is known, itself retailed for $40. That's around £30 here in the UK, though not factoring in any shipping costs. It was designed by Sony's own artists, and has a 100oz capacity. \"Elevate your movie snack game with the limited-edition Ghost of Yōtei Popcorn Bucket,\" the description reads, with Alamo Drafthouse calling it \"the perfect keepsake for any aspiring warrior\". A perfect keepsake it may well be, but even though the popcorn bucket was only revealed last night, it has already sold out online. Sorry for any of you who were looking forward to reaching into a Ghost of Yōtei-themed food vessel, but that chap just simply isn't available any more. I have popped my email address into the 'Notify Me When Available' tab, so will let you know if this changes. In the meantime, you can check out how the Ghost of Yōtei Popcorn Bucket looks from different angles below. Image credit: AlamoMart While this popcorn bucket isn't currently available for purchase, PlayStation and developer Sucker Punch have also got some Ghost of Yōtei-themed PS5s and controllers in the pipeline. Revealed during last week's dedicated Ghost of Yōtei State of Play - which provided us with an overview of gameplay, different modes, weapons and more - this hardware is \"rooted in traditional Japanese art\".",
