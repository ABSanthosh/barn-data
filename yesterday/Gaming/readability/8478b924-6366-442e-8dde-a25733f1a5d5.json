  "text": "Hello, PlayStation community! My name is Sam Eng, and I’m the sole developer of Skate Story, a game about a demon made of glass who needs to skate the Underworld and consume The Moon to fulfill the devil’s contract. Cool, right? I hope so, because today I wanted to share that Skate Story will be heading to PS5. Skate through nine layers of hell and battle larger-than-life bosses as you attempt to free yourself from the devil’s contract that has been placed upon you. As the glass Skater’s story progresses, you’ll dive further into the depths of The Underworld (with help from the Subway system of course, just make sure you have your Millicard handy to get through the gates). You won’t be alone in your journey, as a whole cast of characters is rooting for you. It has been quite the road leading up to release from when I first started sharing clips of the game publicly on social media five years ago. Today, I wanted to share some fresh gameplay of a few new areas the player will have the pleasure of perfecting. As you skate through hell, you’ll master your board, trick over vicious demons, grind some ledges, and destroy bosses, all while accompanied by an atmospheric original 12-set soundtrack by Blood Cultures with supporting tracks from John Fio, creating a truly immersive environment. Combat and boss battles When demons from the Department of Death terrorize the Skater, sick tricks and fresh lines will be the only way out. Boss fights in particular, are intense skate sessions, each backed by a unique song the music of which you’ll need to keep up with. In the trailer above, you’ll catch a glimpse of just one of these boss encounters – as you face off against the Moon. How do you take down a celestial body? You must skate. When the song comes on, stay in its sight line, keeping your momentum going by skating fast and popping tricks at the right time. The Skater’s tricks deal damage to the Moon. Switch up the tricks to keep it Fresh — doing the same old tricks or going too slow will go stale and deal less damage. You’ll need to have dealt enough before the song ends. Flat and shatter into a million pieces when your soul stays stale, or burn through the stars and set them all on fire. Characters The Skater’s journey through the underworld runs across many unfortunate souls living in the underworld. From a forgetful frog to a pillowy demon who owns a laundromat, each character is burdened by their own impassable debt. Befriend a jittery subway train and experience poetry about the multilight of the Moon. Talk with characters about their own plights and learn the many types of eternal tasks signed off by the Department of Death in this surreal underworld. Stylish street skating adventure Cruise through streets and surreal landscapes full of waxed ledges, unholy gaps, and tortured demons in need of rescue. Push your way through precarious paths and shred freeform skate spots to your soul’s desire. Discover and create your own challenges as you explore the world and master your board. Succumb to the beauty of the board Sell your soul for decks, wheels, and trucks to keep your skating fresh. Plus, with over 70+ skate tricks to progress and improve, complete skate trials to level up, learn new tricks through massive obelisks, and get new gear.That’s all for now – I can’t wait to share more news about Skate Story with you later this summer.
