  "text": "Grab older Scarlet and Violet sets before everyone else doesPokémon TCG worldwide has moved into a modern Pokémania. Stock on sets from Surging Sparks onwards is near non-existent, with preorders and restocks selling out within the hour. Don't get me started on scalpers on certain auction sites. This means trainers won't have Pokémon cards to buy unless they're happy paying extortionate prices. I know my mum and dad wouldn't have boosted my spending money that much back when the world was still black and white. The good news is plenty of Sword and Shield / Scarlet and Violet expansions are still available online, but their stock is set to dry up in 2025. It's a great time to stock up on Elite Trainer Boxes that are available yet out of print.Pokémon TCG Elite Trainer Box UK DealsWhilst some of the below have slight discounts, it's just good to see Pokémon TCG products available for regular retail pricing right now. Some of the best pulls in modern sets can be found in the Elite Trainer Boxes Below. We're talking about:- Alt Art Lugia V 186/195 from Silver Tempest (£180 - £200)- Cassiopeia Trainer Art 094/064 from Shrouded Fable (£37 - £40)- Greninja ex SIR 214/167 from Twilight Masquerade (£240 - £315)- Charizard ex SIR 223/197 from Obsidian Flames (£50 - £60)- Terapagos ex SIR 170/142 from Stellar Crown (£55 -£65)Let's also not forget the amazing Illustration rares available in this set. They're affordable and a great binder addition that is almost guaranteed to climb in value as these sets get harder to find. They're my favourite thing to collect in the Sword and Shield / Scarlet and Violet era, plus they make decks look incredibly flashy without breaking the bank on booster packs or buying singles. Let's break these UK deals down and find out which one is right for you: Pokémon TCG: Sword \u0026 Shield—Silver Tempest Elite Trainer Box Pokémon TCG: Sword \u0026 Shield—Silver Tempest Elite Trainer BoxWe've already mentioned Lugia V Alt Art, but this set has so many epic cards to grab. Trainer Gallery Rayquazza VMAX, Rainbow Rare Lugia VStar, Full Art Serena, Unknown V, and so many cool trainer gallery cards. All of the mentioned cards are climbing in value, so it's a good time to snap up Silver Tempest Elite Trainer Boxes for your collection or rip them open. Pokémon TCG: Scarlet \u0026 Violet—Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer BoxPokémon TCG: Scarlet \u0026 Violet—Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer BoxShrouded Fable had a mixed reception when it first dropped, but no one can complain about the amount of great pulls from this sub-100 card holiday set. The Loyal Three special Illustration rares, Fezandipiti ex, Okidogi ex and Munkidori ex look stunning alongside Pecharunt ex SIR. The Illustration rares pop in this set too, with special mentions to Persian IR and Dusklops IR, so snap up a Shrouded Fable ETB for just shy of £40 before they're sold out at retail. Pokémon TCG: Scarlet \u0026 Violet—Twilight Masquerade Elite Trainer Box Pokémon TCG: Scarlet \u0026 Violet—Twilight Masquerade Elite Trainer BoxGreninja ex SIR is one of the most valuable cards in the Scarlet and Violet era right now, and the price isn't calming down. It's backed up by Carmine SIR (which is starting to settle at a decent price), Hisuian Growlithe IR, Perrin SIR and the ever-popular Eevee IR climbing to that near-£100 mark. The top pulls in this set are either climbing in value or evening out to a solid price, which means it's a great time to grab a Twilight Masquerade ETB before the print run stops and the set sells out.Pokémon TCG: Scarlet \u0026 Violet—Obsidian Flames Elite Trainer BoxPokémon TCG: Scarlet \u0026 Violet—Obsidian Flames Elite Trainer BoxEveryone slept on Obsidian Flames. Stock hasn't been an issue so far and all of the pulls are pretty cheap with the exception of Chairzard SIR, which is still at a sub-£70 pricepoint. This is a savvy investment for any trainers collection, in my opinion, and the value of OF cards will skyrocket once the stock dries up in 2025. We've seen the same thing happen to Sword and Shields Crown Zenith and Silver Tempest expansions, so get ahead of the curve with Obsidian Flames. Pokémon TCG: Scarlet \u0026 Violet—Stellar Crown Elite Trainer Box Pokémon TCG: Scarlet \u0026 Violet—Stellar Crown Elite Trainer BoxStellar Crown has some amazing special illustration rares, Illustration rares and hyper rares that would be the highlight of anyones binder. Bulbasaur and Squirtle Illustration rares are two obvious examples, with arguably one of the coolest cards in Hydrapple ex SIR. Stellar Crown hasn't been out for that long, so we can expect to see stock still available for a while. But it's a good time to start ripping Elite Trainer Boxes for its cool art cards and very playable cards before it gets harder to snag.Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
