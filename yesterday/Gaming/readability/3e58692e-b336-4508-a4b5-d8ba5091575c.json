  "description": "A low-quality video of what appears to be a Nintendo Switch 2 has emerged, prompting fan speculation over the as-yet-unseen console and the validity of this footage.The video was posted on Chinese video site Bibli and was first spotted by Nintendo Soup (via Kotaku). The footage appears to show someone removing a joycon from the side of the Switch 2 screen by simply pulling it off. The controllers themselves seem to sport infrared sensors (on both the left and right joycons) and bigger shoulder buttons. This matches previous leaks, which suggested that the Switch 2 would have magnetic joycons and a more complex controller layout, though it would also maintain the same basic design as the original Switch. However, the blurry footage could be fake, and feature a version of the console constructed using information from prior leaks.Edited video by me (since the original video is 5+ minutes long)We can also see the man de-attaching the Joy-Cons at the beginning of the video pic.twitter.com/RtIVDQJOlX — Adrien190303 #ThankYouToriyama (@Adrien190303) December 2, 2024 Details about the upcoming console are still scant. Nintendo has confirmed that an official announcement of the Switch 2 will arrive before April 2025. The console was previously rumored to release in 2024, but reports early this year claimed it had been delayed. The Switch 2 specs are still up in the air, though a Digital Foundry report claimed that the system would use an Nvidia custom T239 processor. Nintendo recently confirmed that the successor will be backwards compatible. Nintendo Switch Online will also carry over to the new system. At least one game has already been announced for the upcoming console.",
