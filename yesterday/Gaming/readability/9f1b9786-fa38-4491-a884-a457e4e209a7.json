It’s a signal that the Fallout team is already feeling confident about Season 2, which finished filming just last week.Fallout TV Show Video Game Easter Eggs – Locations“The holidays came a little early this year - we are thrilled to be ending the world all over again for a third season of Fallout,” Executive Producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy said in a joint statement. “On behalf of our brilliant cast and crew, our showrunners [Geneva Robertson-Dworet] and [Graham Wagner], and our partners at Bethesda, we’re grateful to our incredible collaborators at Amazon MGM Studios and to the amazing fans as we continue our adventures in the wasteland together.”Meanwhile, confirmation that Fallout Season 2 is prepped and ready to arrive in 2025 comes as a bit of a surprise. With filming having wrapped only recently and the LA fires bringing production to a halt earlier this year, many had assumed Fallout wouldn't have more episodes ready before early 2026. While Amazon isn't ready to commit to a firm release date quite yet, news that it will be ready to drop something this December means the Prime Video show is moving full steam ahead.Warning! Potential spoilers for the Fallout TV show follow.Fallout Season 1 let subscribers peer into its world of toxic wastelands last April and has managed to gather more than 100 million viewers globally since. Its story left its trio of main characters – Lucy (Ella Purnell), Maximus (Aaron Moten), and The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) – with a cliffhanger, as a last-minute stinger teased that audiences would soon be traveling to the infamous New Vegas for Season 2.The crew at Bethesda and Amazon have since confirmed Fallout Season 2 will indeed travel to Fallout: New Vegas’ titular town. While most story details remain locked away in a vault, we do at least have confirmation that Robert House (a.k.a. Mr. House) will play some sort of role. Some set leaks have also suggested viewers might catch a glimpse of a few iconic Fallout: New Vegas locations, including Dinky the T-Rex and the Lucky 38 casino.Fallout Season 2 is set to arrive this December, with Season 3 to premiere at an unspecified point in the future. For more while we wait, you can read up on how the show could see as many as six seasons.
