  "text": "Nintendo’s Switch 2 ramp-up week started with a cheerful bang (a jingle, really) at Wednesday’s Switch 2 Direct that revealed the sleek new console’s release date, launch games, and features. Donkey Kong hype abounded online, at least until the company’s news releases started trickling out to outlets like Polygon, and sticker shock took over. Nintendo announced it would charge $450 for its console and $80 for its flagship game, Mario Kart World (or $500 for the two bundled together).Around the same time, President Trump announced his sweeping global trade plan, which included significant tariffs for virtually every country in the world — including uninhabited regions. To put it simply, everyone began freaking the fuck out in response, and the stock market did, too. In the news and on social media, both “Switch 2” and “Trump tariffs” began trending, marking the beginning of a very chaotic 48 hours in which the release of a highly anticipated game console and the blundering whims of the U.S. president became inextricably linked not just for the folks who care about games, but for consumers of other mainstream media, too.The tariffs will impact the cost of almost everything Americans purchase, all amidst stocks plummeting downward and social services getting dismantled. That might include the cost of Switch 2 — a price that a lot of people weren’t happy about before Nintendo announced it would delay pre-orders due to “tariffs and evolving market conditions.” Panic has ensued for fans: What if the Switch 2 is even more expensive than $450? That’s on top of this other bit of lurking dread: What if there aren’t enough Switch 2s to go around?Business professor and author Joost van Dreunen said in an email to Polygon that Nintendo’s “explicit reference to tariffs” in its statement is highly unusual for the company, and for Japanese corporate posturing in general. “Japanese companies traditionally avoid commenting on foreign policy matters, making this directness particularly noteworthy. By specifically naming tariffs as the cause rather than using vaguer language about ‘supply chain challenges’ or ‘global market conditions,’ Nintendo is clearly signaling to shareholders and consumers that the delay stems from external policy decisions rather than internal planning failures.” (Polygon reached out to Nintendo for comment but did not hear back before press time.)There have long been a vocal few in the gaming community who talk about “keeping politics out of games,” which is a senseless take devoid of critical thought to begin with. But that take has never been more senseless than it is right now: Trump’s trade war is, quite literally, impacting games. And Nintendo wants us to know it, too.But it’s likely not because so many gamers’ favorite nostalgia manufacturer is taking a stand against the big bad along with us. It’s a strategic decision (though I wouldn’t be surprised if Nintendo’s execs privately despise Trump for this decision and maybe even others).“It insulates Nintendo from criticism about their own execution while gently educating their consumer base about how trade policy directly impacts product availability and potentially pricing,” van Dreunen said. “The reference to ‘evolving market conditions’ gives them flexibility to make adjustments beyond just responding to tariffs, potentially including competitive positioning against the rumored PS5 Pro price drop or shifts in component availability.”Trump’s newest round of tariffs include a hefty increase up to 46% for Vietnam, the location Nintendo moved much of its manufacturing to several years ago when Trump increased tariffs on China. But van Dreunen doesn’t think it’s too likely Nintendo will raise the price of Switch 2 so close to launch, which he says would be “unprecedented.”“Nintendo needs time to assess whether their existing price point of $449.99 remains viable or if their projected margins have been compromised. The delay gives them flexibility to either secure additional inventory ahead of potential tariff implementation, explore manufacturing alternatives, or adjust their go-to-market strategy,” van Dreunen said. “More likely, Nintendo will maintain the announced price but potentially reduce initial production volume or adjust bundle offerings to preserve margins. They’re essentially buying time to make the most informed decision possible in a rapidly evolving trade environment.”And while it’s tempting to take van Dreunen’s salient expertise here as a sign that it’s not all that bad, he also says the gaming industry tends to offer a decent pulse on the rest of the economy.“Nintendo specifically makes an interesting barometer because their audience skews more mainstream and family-oriented than competitors, meaning their customer base includes the middle-income consumers most affected by economic headwinds,” van Dreunen said. “In this case, Nintendo’s response to these tariffs offers a preview of how global companies with complex supply chains will navigate increasing trade barriers – not by immediately passing costs to consumers, but by tactical delays and strategic reassessment. Their caution signals the broader uncertainty facing multinational companies as global trade tensions escalate.”The only thing we know for sure is that a lot more uncertainty is coming our way.",
