  "text": "Little Chef 2 is a cozy, wholesome cooking game where you can drop things into a pot and cook up some strange creations. This game is the sequel to Little Chef, a free-to-play browser-based game that feels very similar. Little Chef 2 feels like the same concept with more focus and polish, creating an even better experience. The game itself is very simple; there are several kitchens that you can cook in. You start off in a humble student accommodation, looking at the cluttered countertops and dirty dishes in front of you. There is a book to sort of guide what you are focused on, although this physics-based gameplay is pretty open to whatever you want. With a massive pot on the stove, you can add one to three ingredients into it, then heat it up to see what you can make. Inside the book in Little Chef 2, you can see black outlines of all of the recipes you’ve not discovered yet, along with their title, which is often just enough to figure out exactly what you need to do. Once you have solved that recipe, you can see it below. Some recipes can use more than one ingredient, so they have a question mark. All of the recipes do have a little cute description, sometimes about a memory. Along with food that we could probably eat in real life, there is also a swirly purple section which has wild and wacky recipes that often aren’t very edible at all. There are also badges that you can earn in Little Chef 2, earning them for tasks like washing the dishes or cutting up some food. It’s simple but quite fun to discover. Everything feels interactable and there are so many things to touch. The subtle puzzling element is increased when you have locked areas that you need to uncover and secrets hiding in the walls as well. So far in its preview build, Little Chef 2 seems like a lot of fun. Little Chef 2 is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can add it to your Steam Wishlist.
