  "text": "Image credit: Microsoft In anticipation of Doom: The Dark Ages imminent arrival, Microsoft has unveiled a selection of limited edition Xbox accessories, including a wireless controller sporting the sleek, blood-spattered hues of the Doom Slayer. Starting with the controller, its body, buttons, and directional pad are all chest plate green, while its right thumbstick has been coloured red to match the Doom Slayer's augmented nipple - or \"chest port\" as Microsoft insists on calling it. That's alongside \"silver-plated sheathing\" for the grippy bits, and \"3D silver helmet spikes\" surrounding the Xbox guide button. It's a pretty nifty looking thing, and costs £74.99/$79.99 USD - which includes the Doom Slayer Executioner Skin DLC for Doom: The Dark Ages. It's available to purchase exclusively from the Microsoft Store until 18th April, after which it'll be making its way to other retailers. Introducing the DOOM: The Dark Ages Limited Edition Collection Here's a trailer showing off Xbox's Doom: The Dark Ages accessories.Watch on YouTube Fans of the Xbox Elite Series 2 have their own option, with Microsoft also announcing a Doom: The Dark Ages variant of its premium controller. This one's a little more subdued, featuring a black body, maroon buttons and sticks, plus a final nosebleed flourish. Sure the giant red Mark of the Slayer in the middle looks a bit naff, but you can't have everything. This one costs £179.99/$199.99 and is available from 25th April - although you can pre-order it now. And finally, the Mark of the Slayer returns for a limited edition Xbox Series X wrap designed to resemble a sort of crumbling, blood-spattered stone obelisk. It also includes some eye-catching innards, scrawled with \"unspeakable inscriptions and symbols from the deepest levels of Hell\". It's compatibile with disc and all-digital Series X consoles and costs £49.99/54.99 USD. Both the Doom: The Dark Ages wrap and Elite Series 2 controller are exclusive to the Microsoft Store. And if any of these takes your fancy, you'll find more details here. As for Doom: The Dark Ages itself, it launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 15th May. It's looking promising too, with Eurogamer's Robert Purchase calling it a \"bold reimagining [and] a brave departure\" earlier this year.",
