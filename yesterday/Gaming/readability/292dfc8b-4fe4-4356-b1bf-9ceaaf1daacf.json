  "text": "If there’s one thing we love here on Super Earth, it’s the truth. We’ve even got a whole Ministry dedicated to the creation, fine-tuning, and wide distribution of it. It’s about time we gave our Helldivers some Ministry of Truth-approved equipment to match our deep, enduring love of and commitment to the Truth. With these tools, you will become one of Super Earth’s official Truth Enforcers. Being a Truth Enforcer means showing your allegiance to Super Earth’s superiority as the arbiters of truth. The best way to demonstrate loyalty? By carrying the PLAS-15 Loyalist plasma pistol. Come on, it’s got “loyal” in the name already. It also allows you to shoot semi-auto style, or you can charge it up for a shot with more kick. We have two infallible primary weapons available in Truth Enforcers, too. First up is the SG-20 Halt: a pump-action shotgun, similar to the Punisher, that can alternate between stun rounds and armor-penetrating flechette rounds. You can stun foes with accuracy and pierce through their lies with little arrows of veracity. If that’s not enough raw sincerity to take them out, you’ve also got the SMG-32 Reprimand, which is a heavy SMG. It also has a cool slap reload, just like in the accurate, true-to-life movies you love.  It’s not enough to signal your Enforcer status with weapons alone, however. You’re also going to need some new Helldrip. For our light armor-loving comrades, you can tap into your bureaucratic spirit with the UF-16 Inspector in crisp, stain-free white with red accents and a coordinating cape, the “Proof of Faultless Virtue.” It’s giving overseer. Squad Leader. But let’s say you want something a little more hefty and protective, in which case I recommend the UF-50 Bloodhound medium armor and the “Pride of the Whistleblower” cape, picking up on those deep, official-looking reds. And because we want our Helldivers to stand strong against all who oppose the truth, both of these armors have the Unflinching passive, which reduces staggering when hit. Truth Enforcers also includes new cosmetic patterns for your hellpods, exosuits, and Pelican-1. The Inconspicuous Black Pattern looks as mysterious as it does ceremonial. Equip these and you’ll bring immediate order to the chaos of other divers in your squad. To fully walk the walk and demonstrate your commitment to Super Earth’s order to the team, you can equip the new player title, Free of Thought. You’ll also be able to secure the At Ease emote, giving your Helldiver a stoic, commanding, order-following vibe. This Enforcer isn’t the type to laugh at all these pull-my-finger emote jokesters on the squad. You know they need proper clearance and permits for that. Don’t worry–we didn’t forget about the booster, either. Have you ever wanted just a little bit more stamina on the battlefield? Have you ever thought, while being chased by a Terminid horde, I’d die to have just a bit more gas to go the distance. If that sounds like you, Helldiver, then I have some good news: the new Dead Sprint booster may drain your health once your stamina is at zero, but it will enable you to keep outrunning the enemy. The spread of truth and justice across the galaxy is a big job, Helldiver, but a real Truth Enforcer has the tools and the talent to do it. The Truth Enforcers Premium Warbond* lands on October 31! *Requires base game, paid purchase of Super Credits, and game progression to unlock. Trending Stories",
