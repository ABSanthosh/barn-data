Monster Hunter Wilds OBT PC Low Poly Model Tier List:S - Rey Dau, a paper plane of all time.A - Chatacabra, the cube with legsB - Dogashuma, another fun cube but it's more plumpC - Balahara, that looks far too passable to be funny pic.twitter.com/uvbkwsvOva— Project αΩ (@DzatBL) November 1, 2024 There are also people making little artworks in tribute. And there are people extending the craze to the game's human characters, whose low poly incarnations all look awfully redolent of PS1 classic Vagrant Story, thanks to Monster Hunter's comparable faux-medieval aesthetics. Studying these low-poly models is a useful exercise for armchair developers like myself, inasmuch as it reveals which parts of the base monster's appearance the Wilds artists consider essential, in order for you to perceive it as a monster at all - shape, colour, anatomy, texture, et cetera. All told, I wonder if they'd consider doubling down on the LOD glitch and making it a proper feature, perhaps with some directorial commentary. But above all, I need to know how exactly you make yourself some juicy leather pauldrons from a Chatacabra that looks like a haunted box of tissue paper.",
