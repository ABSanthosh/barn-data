  "text": "Arriving later this week. Image credit: EA The Sims 4 is about to get a little messier - and marginally more fashionable for those in a certain generational bracket - as it prepares to launch a fresh wave of newly announced Kit DLC. These new small-scale DLC packs begin with The Sims 4's Kitchen Clutter Kit, which does exactly what it sounds like, providing various bits of decor players can use to give their cooking spaces a more lived-in feel. You've got fridges adorned with magnets, open cereal boxes, kitchen timers, recipe tablet, and \"much more\" - useful for when you're looking to create a living space with more personality than a showhome. There's more mess to be found in The Sims 4's Restoration Workshop Kit, which looks to provide fixtures and furnishings players can use to build a well-utilised workshop. \"With [this kit], Sims can take well-loved, broken-down appliances, including reviving a microwave, coffee maker, refrigerator and stove with the Handiness Skill,\" EA explains. \"Restore the appliance to its former glory, and make it fully functional again.\" The Sims 4's Kitchen Clutter Kit. | Image credit: EA Rounding out The Sims 4's latest batch of DLC drops is the Golden Years Kit, featuring fashionable looks and accessories Elder Sims can use to \"express their individuality\". EA is a bit vague on the details for this one, but expect the likes of toupees, gardening gloves, and glasses with straps - meaning Elder Sims with a penchant for partying won't lose them mid-swing. The Sims 4's Restoration Workshop Kit. | Image credit: EA The Sims 4's Restoration Workshop Kit, Kitchen Clutter Kit, and Golden Years Kit all arrive this Thursday, 1st May. They'll likely cost £4.99 apiece, and will be available on all platforms - which is to say PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Elsewhere in the world of The Sims, footage from EA's new The Sims \"game concept\" - which may or may not be the much-discussed Project Rene - recently surfaced online, and fans eager for a proper Sims 4 sequel weren't exactly thrilled to see what looked like a naff mobile game.",
