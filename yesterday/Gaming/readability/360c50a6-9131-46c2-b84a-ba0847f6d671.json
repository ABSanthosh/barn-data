  "description": "Death, taxes, and video games getting delayed--it seems these are the three constants in 2025, with a number of high-profile video games getting delayed past their initial release dates. Some of these have been delayed far past their initial dates, while others have only been delayed more recently. To help keep everything organized, we've made a list of every game delayed right now, including those with delays announced weeks, months, or even years ago. Once a game has been released, it will be removed from this list. Assassin's Creed ShadowsIt's rare that a delay shocks us these days, but Ubisoft managed to do it with Assassin's Creed Shadows--the series just always seems to hit its planned release dates, but that hasn't been the case with this game. It was first delayed out of 2024 to February before landing on a March 20, 2025 release date. Soup PotEveryone knows soup tastes better when it takes more time to simmer, and Chikon Club's Soup Pot will be doing that--slated for release in August, the game is now coming to Xbox platforms and PC later this year in order to give the developer more time for polishing. You'll be doing \"livestreams\" of your cooking in the game to make over 100 dishes. Crimson DesertFirst revealed with a gameplay trailer in 2020 and planned for a 2021 launch, the open-world spin-off to Black Desert Online, Crimson Desert, is now arriving in late 2025. Prince of Persia: The Sands of TimePrince of Persia: The Sands of TimeOriginally planned for a launch this March, the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake was delayed to an unclear future date back in February. Ubisoft cited wanting to make a remake that still feels fresh while staying true to the spirit of the original version, but it didn't specify how long the delay would be. The series has been largely on ice since Assassin's Creed exploded in popularity over a decade ago, though we did get the excellent The Lost Crown spin-off recently. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2A game awash in controversy and production issues, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has been delayed numerous times. It was originally planned to launch all the way back in 2020, and was subsequently delayed well past that point as development changed hands. It's now planned to launch in 2025. PragmataA mysterious and Death Stranding-esque game from Capcom, Pragmata was already not scheduled to arrive until 2022. However, that window has now been closed, as the publisher revealed the game will instead be arriving in 2023. No specific reason was given for the delay other than wanting to provide a better experience. ReplacedThe upcoming sci-fi platformer Replaced was planned to release in 2022, but the game was then pushed into 2023, then 2024, and then 2025. The decision to push the game to 2023 was made by developer Sad Cat Studios along with Coatsink and Thunderful because the studio has developers located in both Belarus and Ukraine. With the ongoing war, the team opted to relocate and had to pause development during this period. The second and third delays appear to be related to game quality as the team continues development. Arc RaidersA cooperative shooter created by a former Battlefield developer, Arc Raiders was previously scheduled to arrive in 2022. However, Embark Studios put out a message in August that announced a delay to 2023 in order to \"expand the experience, and allow it to reach its fullest potential.\" As of 2025, it is still not out. The Wolf Among Us 2Previously planned to launch in 2023, Telltale's The Wolf Among Us 2 has been delayed out of the year. Work began on the project in 2020 at the rebooted Telltale--which is much smaller than the original studio--and the studio said in its announcement that it simply needs more time to deliver something up to players' expectations. No new window or date were announced. Ark 2 and Ark: Survival AscendedPreviously planned to launch in 2023, Ark 2--the sequel to Ark: Survival Evolved and a Vin Diesel vehicle--will now be coming in 2024. Developer Studio Wildcard announced that the delay was necessary to \"deliver the ultimate next-gen dinosaur survival experience.\" No footage from the game will be shown in 2023, either, following the pre-rendered reveal trailer that included Vin Diesel.The original game's remade version--Ark: Survival Ascended--was also hit with a delay, getting bumped to October 2023. Studio Wildcard attributed this to struggles with Unreal Engine 5 and did not provide a firm release date. Hollow Knight: SilksongWe know remarkably little about Hollow Knight: Silksong, a game that was announced, went dark for what seemed like an eternity, and then made one more appearance before going dark again. It was previously planned to release in the first half of 2023, but Team Cherry has opted to push the window back to an undetermined point in the future in order to make the game as good as possible. Phasmophobia (consoles)Developer Kinetic Games was prepping for the release of Phasmophobia on PlayStation and Xbox platforms in August. However, a fire broke out at the studio's offices, which it said affected its ability to \"test and develop.\" Now, fittingly enough, the console versions are coming in the week leading up to Halloween. Cities: Skylines 2 (consoles)Cities: Skylines 2 is, unlike the original game, coming to consoles close to its PC release. It was supposed to be coming to consoles at the same time, but the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions have been delayed into 2024. The development team said it needed more time to \"reach the quality targets\" it had set for itself on console. No Rest For The WickedThe next game from Ori creator Moon Studios, No Rest For The Wicked certainly has high expectations riding on it. Publisher Take-Two seems to be aware of this, as the company opted to delay the game into FY 2025, putting its release date at April 2024 at the earliest. The ThaumaturgeThe Thaumaturge was scheduled to arrive in February. However, Fool's Theory and 11 bit studios noted in the delay announcement that it would be releasing in a very busy period if it stuck to that date. The game is finished, but will now be releasing on March 4 in order to give it a better chance to be seen. Prison Architect 2Previously planned to release in March, Paradox Interactive's Prison Architect 2 was then moved to a May date before receiving another delay--this time shortly before it was set to launch. Stability issues, particularly on lower-spec systems, led Paradox Interactive to move the game to September 3, 2024. However, it would then be delayed indefinitely, with the team saying it has identified areas it needs to improve prior to launch. Little Nightmares IIIThe highly anticipated follow-up Little Nightmares III is no longer arriving in 2024. Developer Supermassive Games and publisher Bandai Namco Europe said they want to focus on quality, opting to delay the game to 2025 as a result. DemonschoolAlso scheduled to release in September was Demonschool, a tactical RPG. The studio Necrosoft Games said the delay, which goes into 2025, will be best \"for the game, and for the team as well.\" The team added that \"delaying allows us to add more life and liveliness to the world, so it's more of a game you can hang out in, aside from smashing demons of course.\" Tales of the ShireThe upcoming Lord of the Rings game Tales of the Shire was supposed to launch in 2024, but developer Weta Workshop announced shortly before the game's planned release date that it was shifting to early 2025. The studio said it wanted it to be \"everything you're hoping for,\" necessitating the delay. The game was then set for March before settling on a July 29, 2025 date. HunterxHunter NenxImpactDeveloper Eighting Co. has confirmed that HunterxHunter NenxImpact, a fighting game set in the anime's universe, will no longer arrive in 2024. A new undetermined release date has been set for 2025 in order to give the development team time to implement rollback netcode, which is becoming a highly requested feature in many online fighting games. The AltersOriginally planned to release in 2024, the upcoming sci-fi survival game The Alters is now arriving in 2025. The announcement was made by developer 11 bit studios, which noted that it wants to \"optimize all mission-critical systems and ensure that every aspect of your journey is as seamless as possible.\" Broken ArrowSlitherine and Steel Balalaika have opted to move the release date for Broken Arrow from 2024 to an undetermined future date in 2025. The decision was made in order to allow for further multiplayer stabilization and to ensure the game works across multiple hardware configurations. CabernetVampire game Cabernet would have been a good fit for spooky season, but the development team believes the game is \"not in a state [it feels] truly represents Cabernet and the work this team has put into it.\" As a result, it's now releasing in 2025 on PC and consoles. Corpse Party II: Darkness DistortionThe post-mortem mayhem will come a little later than anticipated. Corpse Party II: Darkness Distortion has been delayed to 2025, with the development team giving a vague \"improving game quality\" explanation for the move. John Carpenter's Toxic CommandoThe first-person shooter John Carpenter's Toxic Commando--made in collaboration with the legendary film director--is no longer arriving in 2024. The game will now release no earlier than April 2025. MIO: Memories In OrbitMIO: Memories In Orbit will have to just live in our memory for a little longer, as it has been delayed to 2025. The game will now arrive, at the earliest, in April 2025. https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1641960/view/4505380324428152777 Forever SkiesCurrently in Steam Early Access, Forever Skies was planned to have its full launch in 2024. However, the game will now be releasing in 2025 as the development team opted to expand the game in several areas, including progression and world design. Baby Steps\"Inadvertent Tripping Simulator\" Baby Steps will be arriving in 2025, rather than 2024 as previously planned. The news was announced at the Devolver Delayed Awards in late November. Stick it to the StickmanAlso delayed at Devolver Delayed 2024 was Stick it to the Stickman. The stick-figure brawler will now arrive in 2025. Skate StorySkate Story was formally delayed at the Devolver Delayed 2024 event. The demonic skate-action game will arrive in 2025, though a final date has not been announced. Commandos: OriginsThe highly anticipated return of the Commandos series will have to just be highly anticipated for a little bit longer. Kalypso Media has opted to move the game's release date to March 2025. Feedback from the recent demo will be addressed during this time, particularly regarding AI behavior, voice acting, and performance. Date EverythingMore like \"Delay Everything,\" am I right? Date Everything was originally planned to launch on Valentine's Day--which is fitting--but the title has now been delayed to June 2025. Crysis 4Image from Crysis 3It has already been over a decade since Crysis 3 released, but it might be even longer than expected before we get another Crysis game. Crytek announced in early 2025 that development of the next Crysis has been put on hold, with the studio suffering significant layoffs as it focuses its attention on Hunt: Showdown 1896. It's unclear if or when the game will resume development. Bionic BayThe moody sci-fi platformer Bionic Bay is arriving just a little bit later than planned. In order to give the development team at Mureena and Psychoflow Studio extra time to polish the experience, the game will now launch on April 17, 2025, with a demo available via Steam prior to that date. Parallel ExperimentThe creepy co-op puzzler Parallel Experiment is launching later than planned, as Eleven Puzzles says it opted to delay the game in order to avoid cutting several extra features and puzzles. Because of the delay to June 5, 2025, however, the mobile version will now launch alongside the PC release. FableThe Fable franchise has been on ice for quite a while, with unsuccessful and canceled spin-offs being the only new content since Fable 3 well over a decade ago. The franchise reboot Fable was planned to launch in 2025, but it has been delayed to 2026. Details on the reason are scarce, though Xbox Game Studios head Craig Duncan promises the extra time is worth it.",
