For five years, the world’s biggest game disappeared from its its most popular platform in an unprecedented move that set the stage for one of gaming’s tensest legal battles. Now that it’s back, Fortnite has once again become the number one free game on iOS, and it’s showing up with verve.For those who didn’t follow Fortnite’s legal odyssey, the quick version of the story is that Epic Games took issue with Apple’s storefront. Apple collects a percentage of all sales made on the platform, a fee that drives up the price for Fortnite’s in-game currency. Epic attempted to circumvent this issue by giving fans the option to purchase currency outside of Apple’s storefront at a discounted rate, which did not sit well with the Silicon Valley giant. Apple deemed that Epic broke its rules, ultimately pulling the publisher’s app store account. Rather than acquiesce to Apple’s demands, Epic fought the iPhone maker in court. It won, but not without some headaches along the way, much to the chagrin of the judge who oversaw the case.It’s been about a month since Fortnite’s return on iOS, and Epic Games has met the moment by showing off why the battle royale belongs on mobile with a new mode called Fortnite Blitz Royale. Matches are designed with phones in mind, and this approach completely transforms the game.In Blitz, players are still plopped onto an island, but it’s much smaller now. Things move at a lightning pace, and you literally run from a storm a mere minute into the match. Everyone begins with a set power-up, like the ability to run extra fast or ammo that continually reloads. These abilities change and stack as the player racks up kills. Rather than having to scrounge for a good weapon, the game might gift you a mythic simply for surviving longer than the competition. There’s no building. Where a typical Fortnite match could see a player roaming for an extended period of time without finding anyone, the shooting is almost immediate in Blitz.Epic unveiled the game with a clear eye toward mobile, noting that Blitz was “phone ready” and “perfect” for the platform. And the design certainly lends itself to grab and go sessions where playtime might be limited. You can get a few matches in over the course of 10 minutes. Even if you die quickly, chances are good that you’ll get a few kills along the way.Anyone who has sought a victory royale before will pick up Blitz easily, but there’s still an undeniable freshness to the mode. It’s everything people like about Fortnite compressed to its stickiest elements — all action, none of the filler. And based on Epic’s four-week schedule for the mode, which includes events tied to Avatar: The Last Airbender and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, there’s still plenty coming down the pike to maintain interest.As you read this, Blitz is the most populated mode in Fortnite, with over four times the number of active players as what you’ll find in Battle Royale. Players are psyched and calling for the mode, which only lasts until July 15, to become a permanent offering.“Blitz Royale is the best Fortnite has ever been,” reads one top post on X.At least some of this excitement is the natural consequence of bots inflating the ego of lapsed players, who are thrilled at their newfound deadliness in the mode. It’s hard to have a bad time when you’re handed a golden gun and proceed to dominate the competition. Still, this type of shot in the arm is no small feat for a game that has to find ways to reinvent itself on a monthly basis.Fortnite’s still got it, and mobile proves it.See More: CultureFortniteGamingImpressionsMobileNintendoNintendo Switch 2PlayStationXboxFortniteFortnite Battle Royale",
