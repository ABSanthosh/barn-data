  "text": "Great God Grove gives you a gun that can suck up what people say and then blast those words into other conversations to clear up problems. The gods periodically get together to shut down the apocalypse. Doing something permanent about such a massive disaster is probably a better way of doing things, but those of us with the most power don’t always do the smartest things, do they? Anyway, during their most recent get-together, some letters were passed around that have caused some misunderstandings and hostility between them. So, now things have devolved into squabbling while a massive rift is about to destroy the world. Naturally, it falls to a regular person to clear up misinformation and infighting amongst an array of the world’s most powerful and elite as they ignore real problems in favor of pointless bickering (feeling a bit on-the-nose these days). To that end, you, as the gods’ mail carrier, get the Megapon, a tool that lets you vacuum up someone’s words so you can use them someplace else. Now, you can only absorb some specific phrases from people to use elsewhere, but it’s on you to figure out how to use that phrase to clear up some of these issues. Taking words out of context and using them to clear up misunderstandings is definitely something new. Something endlessly fun in this stylish world filled with lighthearted, fun conversations, though. Great God Grove is a sharp language-based puzzle game that feels terribly relevant these days, even in its playfulness. It just felt good to clear up problems caused by words in this vibrant, delightful world even if I felt a hint of bitterness at having to take it upon myself to clear up issues that the gods should be sorting out. But perhaps that message of regular people needing to get our leaders in line might be a vital takeaway. Great God Grove is available now on the Nintendo eShop, Microsoft Store, and Steam.
