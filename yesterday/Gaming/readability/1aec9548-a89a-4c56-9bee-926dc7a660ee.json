Fantasy Critic League – Like Fantasy Football, but for Video Games Last week we left off with the scoreboard looking like this. The Standings for Week 25 Then, over the course of the week, there were just two updates, both related.  First, there was a score update. Old Skies [Picked by Pretty Blue Fox Games (Bhagpuss)] Score has gone DOWN from 80.8 to 79.5 And, as expected, when a picked game’s score goes down then somebody’s score on the board goes down with it. Publisher Score Updates Pretty Blue Fox Games (Bhagpuss) Score has gone DOWN from 85.0 to 83.7 Pretty simple, that.  So the scoreboard ended up looking like this at the end of the week. The Standings for Week 26 Bhagpuss is still in first place and projected for first, but is also the only player with six releases on the board.  You can see a few other small score changes, and Archey and Arhanta swapped projected final positions, but no new releases meant no big updates, no bids, and just one drop. Drops Dave the Diver – In the Jungle Rodent Entertainment (Arhanta) Drop Successful So that one has been disposed of before anybody could counter pick it… but we’ll get to that in a moment. Next week will see two releases. Coming up for Week 27 The rest of July and into August will have updates.  So this will be the slowest week for a while yet. And that was really it.  Not much to write about.  So I figured I would use the bottom section of this week’s post… where I suspect it is effectively below the fold so that only the truly dedicated will see it… to ponder the mechanics of the league so far, lessons learned, and what we might do next time, if there is an appetite for a next time. There are a few aspects I have in mind, like the number of picks everybody should get (more!) the number of free drops people should get (more!) and that sort of thing. But the primary thing on my mind is counter picks.  I have decided that I do not like them. I thought that counter picks might be an interesting aspect to the game, a little spice in the mix, so much so that I even opted in on the idea that you can’t drop a title if somebody has counter picked it, a decision that became problematic right away with cancelled titles. But beyond that blunder of mine, counter picks just aren’t that interesting to me now that I have watched them in action.  Part of the problem is that so few titles actually get a score below 70. I mean, there are always a few.  I mentioned Captain Blood previously, at the time the lowest scoring title of the year so far. Captain Blood and its Scores Captain Blood has since been eclipsed by Minds Eye. Minds Eye now sets the low bar Neither of them made for an especially good counter pick, in part because FCL has a sliding scoring scale so that below 60 it is half a point per point increment, and the scoring gets softer the further down it goes, so that Minds Eye and is 34 is only -18.2 if you picked it, or 18.2 if you counter picked it.  Good… better than average… but not a killer. That is compounded by the additional detail of only being able to counter pick titles that other people in the league have picked.  So not only does a title have to be bad, somebody has to have picked it and you have to figured it out all in advance. It feels like it would be better to just have another pick than a counter pick. The result is that the most reasonable tactic becomes guessing a title that simply won’t ship so that it will have zero net effect on your score.  There is very little chance of a counter pick of your own helping you, so the most reasonable tactic is to go with something that won’t hurt you. Or such is my thinking at the moment. What do you think of the counter pick as a mechanic so far this season?

sliding scoring scale so that below 60 it is half a point per point increment, and the scoring gets softer the further down it goes, so that \u003cem\u003eMinds Eye\u003c/em\u003e and is 34 is only -18.2 if you picked it, or 18.2 if you counter picked it.  Good… better than average… but not a killer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is compounded by the additional detail of only being able to counter pick titles that other people in the league have picked.  So not only does a title have to be bad, somebody has to have picked it and you have to figured it out all in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt feels like it would be better to just have another pick than a counter pick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe result is that the most reasonable tactic becomes guessing a title that simply won’t ship so that it will have zero net effect on your score.  There is very little chance of a counter pick of your own helping you, so the most reasonable tactic is to go with something that won’t hurt you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr such is my thinking at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you think of the counter pick as a mechanic so far this
