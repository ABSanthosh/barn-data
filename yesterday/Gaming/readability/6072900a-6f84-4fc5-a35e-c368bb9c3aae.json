  "text": "Looking at social media comments, many seem confused, irritated, maybe a little scared by the fact that people indulge in virtual agriculture. How could they! And who are they, anyway? If the mere concept has you questioning the appeal of rural busywork, let us enlighten you. Pour yourself a cup of tea. Add a dash of your favorite energy drink, if you have to. We’ll explain who plays Farming Simulator – and why they love it. Plus, with Farming Simulator 25 launching on Xbox Series X|S today, promising plenty of new updates and improvements – it’s the perfect time to give a virtual farming career a try. Why Should You Start A Farm? Take your pick, there are many reasons: relaxation, escapism, self-determination, and generally wholesome entertainment are just the overarching buzzwords – but here’s a few more reasons to kick off your virtual farming career. Adapting to Challenges – From yield improvement and timely management of fields to withstanding seasons and weather events like twisters. You’ll be kept on your feet. Growing the Business – Expand and grow your farm into an agricultural empire with construction projects, production chains, and the logistics to make it efficient. Mastering Agriculture – Farmer’s never stop learning. There’s much for you to explore and experience. You will see tractors driving around with different eyes and maybe even appreciate the food in your fridge a bit more. Farming Simulator 25 offers plenty of possibilities to live out a farmer’s dream. For aspiring farmers as well as returning agriculturists who find new crops, animals, machine categories and depth of gameplay – from the feeling of sinking into the mud of deformed soil, GPS-based steering for increased automation and efficiency, extended baling-mechanics based on consumable foil types (expert farmers really love it) up to new challenges like weather events, as twisters and hail prompt land owners to prepare. “Who Even Plays This Stuff?” Without flexing numbers, we can assure you that a lot of people play Farming Simulator. And we don’t mean those with a knack for ironic entertainment, because “lol, tractors”. Sure, one fan told us he was given the game as a joke. He and his family now own a real farm because he got a bit hooked on the idea and is probably the last one laughing. While you may not be rushing out to purchase your own fertile land just yet, you could find yourself fitting into some of the below archetypes. Kids notoriously like tractors and learn how to potato with Farming Simulator. There is some educational value for everyone. Do you know the difference between a plow, a cultivator, and a subsoiler? Parents can relax and play it with tiny observers present. It might be a nice first bonding-experience over gaming, and appropriate for all ages. Gamers who are into cooperative multiplayer. Building a multi-faceted empire of field operations, production chains, and logistics. Everyone plays a role. Stressed-out people too empty after work to engage in competitive online games where verbal shootouts sadly mock the honor of their female guardians. Everyone looking for satisfaction paired with relaxation. Harvesting a crop that grows in straight rows with an Alien-looking machine just scratches this very particular itch. Farmers. The real ones. The ones harvesting the produce you buy at the supermarket and who are basically feeding the world. We know your next question… “Why Would Real Farmers Play It After Work?” Hard to imagine for people who haven’t plowed before, but listen: playing Farming Simulator is not work! Farmers play it because of passion for agriculture. It’s not “just a job” where you feel the need to numb yourself with social media doomscrolling. Farmers love machines, fine-mechanics, and impressive technology. Others enjoy that, too, and might get hooked on the 400+ machines – all authentic and detailed. Farmers can experiment – and so can you. 25 field crops, plus greenhouse crops, various tree species, and an ensemble of animals, now with goats \u0026 water buffalos. The reason is passion. It’s as simple as that. For nature. For plants. For trees. Animals. Machines. And rewarding results. The game allows them to experiment with crops and machinery that they could never grow and operate on their own fields. It’s hard to grow cotton in small fields somewhere in England, for example. Or buying cattle just so you can have natural, sustainable lawn mowers when you really have a sweet sugar beet farm. With three environments to choose from, North-America, Europe and East Asia, Farming Simulator 25 offers an agricultural variety not only farmers find exciting. Farming Simulator 25 Out Today Farming Simulator 25 also features overall enhanced graphics, physics and effects – making this entry of the family-friendly series the most atmospheric and immersive yet. If that’s not enough for you, we have one of the most active modding communities with user-creations hands-on tested by our developers themselves – available directly in the game.
