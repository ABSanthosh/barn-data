And while some players hate them, it doesn’t seem like the developers behind the game are going to stop making them any time soon. Suggested ReadingThis Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak CampaignOffEnglishSuggested ReadingCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 is one of the best entries in the franchise in years, with an action-packed campaign, an awesome zombies mode, and a huge amount of multiplayer content. But the game, which launched in October, also contains a lot of wacky character skins, and these skins have become a controversial topic among players. Some love the wacky skins, like a shark man and assorted celebrities, while others despise these cosmetics and think they are ruining the Call of Duty experience. So why are all these wacky outfits in the game? (Well, besides money, that is.)In a new interview with Dexerto, Miles Leslie, the associate creative director at Black Ops 6 studio Treyarch, was asked about all the silly cosmetics and explained that ultimately, it comes down to letting people have fun. “Fun always comes first for us,” explained Leslie. “Of course, we want to stay grounded in the DNA that makes a Black Ops game unique when it comes to core gameplay, but we also like to break the rules if it’s going to maximize fun for players.”Leslie further suggested that the Black Ops series “naturally lends itself” to more outlandish items and skins, as the COD sub-series has always been more willing to do weird storylines and include more outlandish moments. Call of Duty’s campaigns will stay groundedHowever, Leslie explained that when it comes to developing the campaign, the focus is always on realism and accuracy. “[Black Ops 6's] campaign has a tightly defined cast of characters with an era-specific look to them that fits the story that we and our friends at Raven Software are telling,” said Leslie. “The cool thing is, because the story then continues directly from the Campaign into our Multiplayer experience throughout our post-launch seasons, we now get to develop new looks and lore for those characters while simultaneously building out the cast for both the Rogue Black Ops and Crimson One factions.” Leslie says the studio takes this stuff “very seriously” and wants to continue telling post-launch stories with these characters, but admitted, “That doesn’t mean we can’t have some fun with cosmetics along the way!”Nowhere in Leslie’s answer did the creative director also add the other reason Activision and Treyarch keep adding more silly skins that you have to buy to use. So, I’ll add it below: .",
