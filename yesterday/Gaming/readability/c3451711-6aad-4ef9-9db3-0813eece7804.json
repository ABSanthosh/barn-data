After crafting your candle, place it on the ground. You can place candles in groups of up to four on a single block. If you're using it as a birthday candle, only one can be added to a cake. Craft a flint and steel, and right-click the candle. After a short time, it will light, and you can enjoy the ambient effects of its lighting. To put the candle out, use a little water, or use the flint and steel on it again to extinguish the flame. Using too much water on a candle will cause it to become too damp to light again for a short while.Do candles set fire to wood?Candle flame doesn't spread, meaning you could hypothetically build a giant mansion made entirely of wood blocks, and it wouldn't set fire to anything nearby. They don't melt snow either, so they're a good option for lighting an igloo or placing in snowy biomes.Now that you know how to craft, light, and dye Minecraft candles, check out our Minecraft guides hub for more helpful tips. We've even got a handy Minecraft tools guide, which explains how to craft everything you'll need to get started in Mojang's survival game.
