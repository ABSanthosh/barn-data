  "text": "I spoke with actors Joseph Quinn and Will Poulter today for their new A24 drama Warfare during which time the topic of this week’s Avengers: Doomsday cast announcement came up.“It was relief, I suppose. It was a nice thing,” Quinn, who plays Johnny Storm/The Human Torch in The Fantastic Four: First Steps, said when asked about seeing his name on the back of a chair during the Doomsday live stream reveal (watch the video below).“I think I’m in very good company. I would love to see Will there, too, just because we have a laugh but the road is long in this Marvel land so God willing because it would be fun.”Will Poulter played Adam Warlock in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, which saw Warlock join the new Guardians lineup by the end of the movie. Despite Guardians Vol. 3 announcing that Chris Pratt’s Star-Lord would return, no Guardians actors were among those announced as being in Avengers: Doomsday. “I’m so excited for Joe and I can’t wait for Fantastic Four,” Poulter said as he sat beside Quinn. “I’d love to come back with Adam Warlock and if I can cross over with Joe and the Fantastic Four crew that would be even better.”Perhaps Adam Warlock and Quinn’s Johnny Storm will cross paths in the Doomsday follow-up, Avengers: Secret Wars. Avengers: Doomsday is now in production.Joseph Quinn isn’t the only Marvel actor to break their silence this week on being in Doomsday. Paul Rudd played his cards close to the chest when interviewed by Jimmy Fallon on Thursday.The Most Surprising Avengers and Marvel Characters Not Announced for DoomsdayFor more on Avengers: Doomsday, read up on a theorized Avengers vs. X-Men tease, why the cast reveal probably doesn’t spoil Thunderbolts, the Secret Wars hints in the video announcement, and how even more Marvel stars could still join Doomsday.",
