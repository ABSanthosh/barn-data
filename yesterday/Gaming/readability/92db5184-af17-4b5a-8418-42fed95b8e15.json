  "text": "In The Fog, a Ghoul’s power is to be feared, but also to be respected. They can traverse great distances in the blink of an eye. They can tear flesh apart, devouring it with a gluttonous appetite. They can strike quickly, leaving deep gashes and emotional anguish. Some might say they are the ultimate killers – especially when they fully embrace their dark nature. Upon being tortured beyond comprehension by a sinister Ghoul named Jason, Ken Kaneki did exactly that. Escaping with newfound power awaken by his most primal impulses, he soon found himself engulfed by black Fog… A Ghoul Unleashed Now trapped in an endless cycle of Trials and twisted by The Entity, it’s safe to say the Ken Kaneki you once knew is gone. In his place stands The Ghoul, a masked nightmare as cruel and cunning as the captor who once placed a centipede in his ear. Any Survivor in his path will face the full might of the Kagune – a Power brought to life by Dead by Daylight’s Principal Game Designer Janick Neveu and his team. “While his personality is different, it was important for players to feel like they’re playing the Kaneki they know from the series,” explains Neveu. “The surreal existence of his tentacles are such an integral part of the character, so we knew right away that they would form the basis of his Power.” The team recognized that the Kagune tentacles could be utilized for mobility, which immediately proved appealing. “High-mobility Killers are quite popular, so we knew expectation would be high,” continues Neveu. “We paid close attention to make sure that the gameplay felt fresh, fun, and fair for both sides, as these types of Killers can feel oppressive.” Despite the inherent potential of a high-mobility Killer, the design team wanted The Ghoul to be accessible to new players, so fans of the series coming to Dead by Daylight for the first time could have a familiar face to try out. “He’s simple to use and hard to master,” explains Neveu. “Our last few Chapters featured complex Killers with advanced learning curves, but The Ghoul is much easier to pick up and play. Of course, there’s a high skill ceiling for our veteran players, with plenty of depth to discover.” All The Rage Some of that depth comes through Kaneki’s Enraged Mode, a special ability that really lets players unleash their true power. “While in Enraged Mode, Kaneki’s tentacles become momentarily stronger,” explains Neveu. “If you successfully hit a Survivor with your final lunge, you will injure them with a Deep Wound and become Enraged. While Enraged, you’ll gain an additional lunge, and if you manage to connect to a Survivor, your follow-up Vault will be even faster. Gaining a key benefit from attacking a Survivor helps adds a fun strategic element to The Ghoul’s gameplay.” With a versatile Power and three unique Perks (Hex: Nothing But Misery, Forever Entwined, None Are Free) that incentivize spreading pressure, Ken Kaneki will feel like he’s everywhere at once.
