  "text": "The wait is over – Lost in Random: The Eternal Die is now open for Advanced Access on Xbox Series X|S and Game Pass! Pre-order the Fortune Edition today to start playing early, or mark your calendar for the full launch on June 17. Set within the eerie depths of the Black Die – a realm ruled by strange odds and ominous forces – your journey as Queen Aleksandra begins now. But Mare the Knight doesn’t play fair – it’ll take more than fast reflexes and a lucky roll to survive… Lucky for you, this handy article is here to help! So, whether you’re a new Dice Wielder stepping into Mare’s twisted domain for the first time or already deep into your hundredth run, these top 10 tips will help you sharpen your strategy, strengthen your synergies, and bend fate in your favour. Ready to beat the odds? Let’s roll. 1. Pick Your Weapon Wisely Your playstyle starts with your weapon choice. Visit Rack in the Sanctuary (brace yourself for puns) to unlock new weapons and purchase powerful enhancements. Each starting weapon brings something unique: Sword of Sixtopia – Broken but deadly, and incredibly versatile. Lance of Lady Luck – Delivers fast, long-range jabs. Helleven’s Hammer – Slower, but packs a serious punch. Sevendipity Striker – Great for keeping enemies at a distance. Try different weapon + relic + card combos to find your favourite setup. There’s no universal “best” build – only the best build for you. 2. Use your Full Arsenal In the chaos of battle, it’s easy to rely solely on your weapon – but don’t forget your cards, relics, and Fortune herself. Mastering your full toolkit is key to surviving, especially early on. That includes relics! Relics are temporary buffs that shape your build each run. Use relics to power up everything from your cards to your die to your charged attacks, or even gain passive boosts. With 100+ relics to discover, the opportunities for builds are endless (well, probably not mathematically – but you do the math!). You won’t always get what you want – relic drops are random after all – so be open to adapting your playstyle. What works great against enemy groups might fall short against single-target bosses, so experiment with different relics and upgrades to find what clicks for you. Dev Tip: Use the relic colour-matching system to gain bonus effects and amplify your build. If you’re unsure which relic to choose, match by colour – it’s a reliable shortcut. 3. Upgrade for Glory Each weapon has four unique upgrade paths, unlocked at Rack’s weapon station back at the Sanctuary. Want to up that damage? Prefer elemental attacks? Or maybe you’d rather go on the defensive with some added damage reduction or health regen? These upgrades let you tailor your loadout to suit your run – and your playstyle. 4. Charge It Up Did you know that all weapons have a powerful charge attack? If not, you may be missing out on some major damage boosts! Mashing attack buttons is fine, but charged attacks deal massive damage – especially when boosted by the right relics. Mastering the timing can feel tricky at first, especially in the heat of battle, but once you start staggering enemies or triggering synergies, you’ll wonder why you ever played any other way. 5. Perfect Your Card Game Card attacks are powerful – but perfect card attacks? That’s where the magic really happens. Nail the timing to earn bonus effects like extra hits or amplified damage. The best part? These stack beautifully with relic boosts for some truly random – and satisfying – results. 6. Throw Fortune Into Battle Fortune isn’t just a charming die with a lot to say (in dice-speak, of course) – she’s a weapon in her own right. Throw her to damage enemies (based on your roll), and use relic builds to stack the odds in your favour. Going for a high-roller strategy? Stack relics that reward high numbers. Feeling unlucky? Build a loadout that turns low rolls into powerful effects. Or go more random! The choice is yours! Whatever your style, Fortune is more than moral support – she hits hard when you let her. 7. Experiment with Blessings During your runs, you’ll find small dice-like creatures called Dicelings, the scattered children of Aama. Return them to her in the Sanctuary to unlock permanent upgrades for Aleksandra. Think of them as tiny dice-shaped blessings… if you’re kind enough to help. Dev Tip: Make sure to experiment with Aama’s blessings.The ones that help during your first runs won’t always be the best later on – so make sure to explore different combinations as you improve. 8. Explore Everything (and Talk to Everyone) Every floor of the Black Die hides secrets – optional encounters, hidden lore snippets, rare relics, and delightfully strange NPCs. Some offer quests, others just unsettling lore, and a few might reward you with game-changing bonuses. Don’t rush. Interact. Investigate. If you think you’ve seen it all, look again. The Black Die always has one more card to play. 9. Check the Legend In your inventory menu, there’s a little feature many players miss: the Legend – a quick guide to status effects, relic traits, card abilities, and more. Not sure what Poison really does? Can’t remember how Conjuration bonuses work? The answers are in the Legend. Use it. Mare’s games are weird enough – no need to guess. 10. Learn From Every Death Death is never the end – it’s just another roll. Each enemy you face in the Black Die has unique attack patterns, behaviours, and weaknesses. Pay attention. Learn. Then rebuild your loadout next run with strategies that counter them. It’s a roguelite, after all – failure is part of the fun! Dev Tip: Learn enemy patterns and watch for red circles – they signal danger. Use dash to reposition or breathe.  If you’re using a melee weapon, try dashing out, throwing Fortune, and dashing back in. A great way to soften up your enemies before that final blow! What is Lost in Random: The Eternal Die? Is it a spin-off? Is it a sequel? The answer is: kind of both! The Eternal Die is a standalone spinoff that can be enjoyed without any knowledge of its predecessor Lost in Random. While the story picks up where the last one left off, this time you play as Queen Aleksandra – the antagonist from the original game. And to match this new hero, we’ve also switched up the genre – The Eternal Die will take you on a roguelite adventure through the twisted realms of Mare the Knight. But don’t worry, you’ll still find that magical experience that you loved about Lost in Random. Expect a tougher challenge, but with the same love and care for the whimsical world of Random. Whether you’re diving in today with Advanced Access or gearing up for launch, remember: in Mare’s world, the odds may be twisted – but the perfect roll is out there. Your fate lies ahead. All that’s left is to throw the die. Pre-order the Fortune Edition now on Xbox Series X|S to play today! And don’t fret Game Pass members: Advanced Access is available to you.
