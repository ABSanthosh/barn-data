  "text": "If you’re new to PlayStation (or just looking to try a new game) you’re absolutely spoiled for choice with PlayStation Plus, which will let you dive into games which helped define PlayStation over the past 30 years. There are far too many games to cover in this humble feature, but here’s an extensive selection that is available for you to enjoy right now via PlayStation Plus. Over 30 games from 30 years? Better charge up your controllers… ​​Jumping Flash | Sony Computer Entertainment | Exact \u0026 Ultra | 1995True revolutions in gaming don’t come around too often, but when a cute looking robotic rabbit by the name of Robbit leapt onto our screens, it helped pave the way for the future. Jumping Flash holds the Guinness World Record as the “first platform video game in true 3D”, which is even more impressive given it’s entirely from a first-person perspective. A real game changer. Twisted Metal | Sony Computer Entertainment | SingleTrac \u0026 Sony Interactive Studios | 1995Demolition derbies in games weren’t all too common when Twisted Metal crashed onto the scene, mixing aggressive high impact driving with vehicular combat that redefined the entire genre. Between its deathmatch-style gameplay and the introduction of everyone’s favorite demonic ice cream truck driver Sweet Tooth, Twisted Metal paved the road for many others to follow.  Tekken 2 | Namco | Namco | 1996True, the original Tekken helped set the stage for the then fresh genre of 3D fighting games, but its sequel established the series as something that could truly go toe-to-toe with its rivals. Its hard-hitting cast and tight gameplay have become a staple of the genre. Not to mention the franchise holds the world record for the longest running story in video games without reboots, retcons, or revisions – that’s a lot of people being thrown from, off or into something from a great height. Resident Evil Director’s Cut | Capcom | Capcom | 1997Horror has always had its place in gaming as far back as 3D Monster Maze in 1981, but it was Resident Evil which crafted the crimson blueprint for horror and all of its sub-genres, since. In particular, Capcom’s classic merged American horror movie schlock with innovative puzzles and genuinely brilliant – and now iconic – jump scares, all set against bleeding edge pre-rendered backgrounds. Survival horror has never been the same, and that’s exactly the way we like it. The original captivated and terrified players back in 1996. The Director’s Cut, featuring some gameplay tweaks, launched one year later. Ridge Racer Type 4 | Namco | Namco | 1999A juggernaut amongst racing games, Ridge Racer had already established its rapidly earned credentials by the time Type 4 hit the track. So this particular entry solidified what everyone had already known or suspected with one of the best entries across the entire series. From its coin-op roots to a now expertly amalgamated engine of arcade driving and realism, Type 4 was Ridge Racer perfected. Ape Escape | Sony Computer Entertainment | Japan Studio | 1999Not many knew what to make of this quirky and colorful platformer when it was first unveiled, but once it was in players’ hands, everything became wonderfully clear. Introducing the possibilities of the DualShock analog controller, Ape Escape’s innovative control scheme, playful visuals and downright cuteness stole the hearts of everyone who played it, just like the peppy primates of the series itself. PlayStation 2 Fantavision | Sony Computer Entertainment | Japan Studio | 2000How many real-time firework themed puzzle games have you played? Chances are, when Fantavision first exploded into view, very few, if any at all. Still enchantingly novel after all these years, Japan Studio’s game was an unforgettable and spectacular showcase of particle effects on PS2. TimeSplitters | Eidos Interactive | Free Radical Design | 2000First-person shooters were in somewhat of a renaissance by the time TimeSplitters arrived, in no small way due to the team behind it. Free Radical Design had the pedigree and talent to skilfully refine the punchy gameplay style and split-screen multiplayer modes that they already popularized, igniting the spark of a new fan-favorite franchise.  Dark Cloud | Sony Computer Entertainment | Level-5 | 2001Seeing the stunning looking Dark Cloud for the first time raised many questions – was it an RPG? A city builder? An action game? The answer? Yes. Inventively mixing genres with procedurally generated dungeon-crawling, Dark Cloud was ahead of its time, and a great demonstration of what PlayStation 2 could bring to our swiftly evolving medium. Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy | Sony Computer Entertainment | Naughty Dog | 2001It’s easy to take for granted how much Jak and Daxter was doing under the hood of its bright, bold and brash sci-fi fantasy platform adventuring. But crafting an expansive and open 3D world full of puzzles, distinctive characters, and collectibles, without loading screens was no easy task. Naughty Dog not only pulled it off, but created a popular series with an incredibly dedicated audience. Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus | Sony Computer Entertainment | Sucker Punch Productions | 2002Stealth games had become a massively popular genre in the early 2000s, but very few were deviating from the military espionage formula that had helped make it so big. In crept Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus, with its creative ‘toon shaded’ visuals and slick gameplay, proving it was possible to be seriously sneaky and stylish, without being solemn. PlayStation 3 Resistance: Fall of Man | Sony Computer Entertainment | Insomniac Games | 2006Alternate World War II history, interstellar invaders and an engaging narrative – there was plenty to enjoy in Insomniac’s fan-favorite first-person shooter. Resistance: Fall of Man impressed not just as a launch title, but as the springboard for a number of superb sequels which followed. God of War III | Sony Computer Entertainment | Santa Monica Studio | 2010*Note: GoW III Remastered released in 2015 on PS4 Before he became a dad, Kratos was chopping it up with the Greek Pantheon, his quest for vengeance arriving at its brutal third-part climax. Here, everything was bigger – the set pieces, violence and even the characters. The latter literally, given the immense visual spectacle of the game’s opening where Kratos fights a veritable army while on the back of the titan Gaia. The 2015 PS4 Remastered version is available to enjoy on PlayStation Plus. Heavy Rain | Sony Computer Entertainment | Quantic Dream | 2010*Note: Heavy Rain released in 2016 on PS4 As a striking combination of impressive visual flair and arresting interactive cinematic gameplay, very few games were doing what Heavy Rain was doing when it launched on PS3. The thriller marked Quantic Dream as a developer to watch, handily helped by a horrifyingly brilliant in-game scene where one of the four protagonists is told to choose between a selection of sharp tools and then… well, if you know, you know. Assassin’s Creed Ezio Collection (PS4) | Ubisoft | Ubisoft Montreal | 2016(Includes Assassin’s Creed 2 | Ubisoft | Ubisoft Montreal | 2009, Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood | Ubisoft | Ubisoft Montreal | 2010, Assassin’s Creed Revelations | Ubisoft | Ubisoft Montreal | 2011)Ubisoft’s stealth series has become legendary thanks to the deeds of one Ezio Auditore da Firenze, the protagonist of the franchise’s many entries. Capturing three of his major escapades from the PS3 era, Assassin’s Creed Ezio Collection is a series hitting its parkour platforming stride across rich open worlds and fascinating historical settings. Far Cry 3 | Ubisoft | Ubisoft Montreal | 2012*Note: Far Cry 3 Classic Edition released in 2018 on PS4 Mixing the first-person shooter genre with an open world setting is a staple of the Far Cry series, but this sequel is where its potential became clear for its sequels. A densely crafted world of hostile wildlife, reactive human enemies, engaging missions, and smart progression systems all made for an impressive experience, elevated via an outstanding performance by Michael Mando as the game’s demented antagonist, Vaas. PSP LocoRoco | Sony Computer Entertainment | Japan Studio | 2006*Note: LocoRoco Remastered released in 2017 on PS4It’s impossible to describe LocoRoco without using the word “adorable”. Sure, its puzzle platforming, charmingly cartoony visuals and well-thought-out controls which used the shoulder buttons to help control the titular LocoRoco were all wonderful. But have you ever had colorful, wide-eyed blobs of joy serenade you as you play? Me neither. Patapon | Sony Computer Entertainment | Pyramid \u0026 Japan Studio | 2008*Note: Patapon Remastered released in 2017 on PS4 While we’re on the topic of song, the wonderfully compelling pata-pata-pata-pon drum beat that accompanies this rhythm-based strategy signals one of the most delightfully weird games on PSP. Its endearing uniqueness earned two sequels and a PS4 remaster, so I know I’m not alone in my admiration. Echochrome | Sony Computer Entertainment | Will \u0026 Japan Studio | 2008 It’s not often you’ll see modern day visual and gameplay innovations in the puzzle genre, but the striking perspective changing, environment shifting mechanics of Echochrome not only achieves that feat, but remains one of the few games directly inspired by both artists M. C. Escher and Oscar Reutersvärd. PS Vita Gravity Rush | Sony Computer Entertainment | Japan Studio | 2012*Note: Gravity Rush Remastered released in 2016 on PS4Defying gravity? Just another day for Kat, a super powered amnesiac who simply wants to help the people of Hekseville and discover the mysteries of her past. Gravity Rush’s novel use of vertical based gameplay in an open world was a refreshing change of pace from other action-adventure games, turning combat scenarios into thrilling topsy-turvy capers. Hotline Miami | Devolver Digital | Dennaton Games | 2013 – also on PS3“Do you like hurting other people?” asks a mysterious man in a chicken mask, early on in Hotline Miami. It’s a question that sets up one of the main themes of Dennaton Games’ frenetic, punishing and utterly compelling top-down shooter. Influencing many other titles in its wake, Hotline Miami remains one of the most successful indie games of all time, with an absolute all-timer of a soundtrack. The game eventually released on PS4 and PS5, which is available through PlayStation Plus. Tearaway | Sony Computer Entertainment | Media Molecule | 2013*Note: Tearaway Unfolded released in 2015 on PS4While Media Molecule made its mark with the iconic LittleBigPlanet, its step into the papercraft world of ValleyFold was as cute as it was creative. Tearaway delivered a parcel of delightfully different styles of gameplay, using the touchscreen, camera, and rear touch panel in a number of wildly inventive ways. This was mimicked via Tearaway Unfolded, an expanded version of the original launched on PS4, which used the DualShock 4 wireless controller in a similarly imaginative manner, and it’s this game that is available on PlayStation Plus. PlayStation 4 Bloodborne | Sony Computer Entertainment | FromSoftware | 2015Bloodborne’s gothic city of Yharnam is not one you’d want to live in, with its terrifying beasts, cosmic horror, and otherworldly mysteries. And yet, there’s not a single one of us which would turn down the chance to return to its dark streets. FromSoftware’s classic and combat heavy action-adventure RPG stunned players on its arrival, and continues to draw acclaim via its masterful gameplay and unforgettable narrative. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt | CD Projekt | CD Projekt Red | 2015Based on the hugely popular Andrzej Sapkowski fantasy novels and steeped in Slavic folklore, it didn’t take long for The Witcher 3 to be recognized as one of the greatest games of all time. Its rich and changing open world, complex narrative and spectacular visuals still remain some of the best in the genre, as witnessed in its enhanced PS5 port, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Complete Edition, which launched in 2022. Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection | Sony Interactive Entertainment | Naughty Dog | 2015*Note: The Nathan Drake Collection released in 2015 on PS4(Includes Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune | PS3 | Sony Computer Entertainment | Naughty Dog | 2007, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves | PS3 | Sony Computer Entertainment | Naughty Dog | 2009, Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception | PS3 | Sony Computer Entertainment | Naughty Dog | 2011)You didn’t think we’d forget about Nathan Drake, did you? Naughty Dog’s charismatic adventurer became a fast favorite with fans via his globe-trotting adventures that mixed shooting, stealth, combat, puzzles, platforming, exploration, massive set pieces, and wisecracks. This was one series that did it all, but never lost sight of the heartfelt storytelling that made it so successful. PS4’s Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection collected the first three titles. Shadow of the Colossus | Sony Interactive Entertainment | Bluepoint Games | 2018 Shadow of the Colossus was a technical marvel when it first hit PS2 in 2005. GenDesign stunned players with an expansive world inhabited by mysterious, towering creatures. Bluepoint Games’ remake in 2018 faithfully retold the tale for a new generation while capturing the beautiful melancholy of the original. The act of climbing colossi and puzzling out their weaknesses is still a wondrous experience today. The game’s twist ending and novel commentary on players’ habits for conquest help the understated narrative stand the test of time. God of War | Sony Interactive Entertainment | Santa Monica Studios | 2018 Heralded by a near-deafening roar of the E3 crowd on its 2016 reveal, God of War’s triumphant return signaled a new era for Kratos. While retaining the bone-crunching violence the series was known for, the thoughtful consideration of its consequences and effect on families developed the series into something which had grown up with Kratos in more ways than one. Final Fantasy VII Remake | Square Enix | Square Enix Business Division 1 | 2020What would any list be without a Final Fantasy game? Returning to one of the most beloved RPGs ever made could have been a massive mistake, but Final Fantasy VII Remake put all fears to rest with a stunning and well considered version of the PlayStation original, expanding its story in surprising new ways. An enhanced version, Final Fantasy VII Intergrade, also hit PS5 a year later. Ghost of Tsushima | Sony Interactive Entertainment | Sucker Punch Productions | 2020*Note: Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut released in 2021 on PS5Visually gorgeous and narratively ferocious, Sucker Punch crafted an open world action-adventure that felt both fresh and lived in. It captured the flavor of classic Akira Kurosawa samurai movies, blending beauty with brutality, not being afraid to let you indulge in its quieter moments. Humanity, hot springs and haikus, slicing against swords, samurai and standoffs. PS5 Demon’s Souls | Sony Interactive Entertainment | Bluepoint Games | 2020Remaking the PS3 action role-playing classic was a tall order that Bluepoint Games surmounted, enhancing its finely honed gameplay with new weapons, items, armour and features, while utilizing the power of PS5. Although still technically a predecessor to the likes of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, Demon’s Souls held its own in this modern revisit.   Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales | Sony Interactive Entertainment | Insomniac | 2020 Leaping onto PS5 to help the console’s launch back in 2020, this new adventure captured the spirited freedom and unbridled joy of web-swinging, and its confident storytelling, spectacular set pieces and amazing combat made for an experience that fans and newcomers alike just couldn’t put down. Ratchet \u0026 Clank: Rift Apart | Sony Interactive Entertainment | Insomniac | 2021The adventures of the universe’s best Lombax and his robotic companion reached an outstanding high point showcasing the hardware grunt of PS5 via its near instantaneous portal travel and creative use of the DualSense wireless controller. Bright, breezy and offbeat, Insomniac’s bouncy shooter platformer was a delight for all. Returnal | Sony Interactive Entertainment | Housemarque | 2021When narrative form and gameplay function merge into a seamless whole, the result can be utterly captivating, as seen in Returnal. Taking an ever-repeating-yet-different roguelike shooter structure and encasing it within a story about an astronaut trapped in a time loop, Housemarque’s casket of mysteries is a compelling voyage of literal self-discovery. The Last of Us: Part I | Sony Interactive Entertainment | Naughty Dog | 2022Humanity. Trauma. Forgiveness. Naughty Dog’s powerful and haunting tale of a post-apocalyptic world stays with anyone who experiences it – and bringing it up to date on PS5 with enhanced visuals, combat, and enemy AI only made an action-adventure classic all the more essential. If you’ve only watched the staggeringly good TV series but not played the game, well, now there’s no excuse.",
