The game's art direction is heavily inspired by Persona 5 but has plenty of mechanics to help make it stand out.Prisma follows a photojournalist named Alma who finds a magical camera that transfers her to another world called Domacon, filled with other Almas from the multiverse. Friend, foe, or NPC, each Alma has a Prism Shard that grants them magical abilities in battle, and rival Almas will try to steal them. The game's turn-based combat is inspired by Persona 5 as well, but has some key differences. Players are able to use Alma's camera filters to distort reality and apply buffs to the entire party of alternate Almas, such as using a fisheye lens to bypass enemy shields or a shattered lens to turn a single-target attack into a multi-target one.Continue Reading at GameSpot",
