Try to link up with a co-op buddy whilst one of you is hiding your online status, and instead of teaming up, the invitee will be informed that: \"Game no longer exists\". Early Access Launch Trailer | Revenge of the Savage Planet | PAX East Revenge of the Savage Planet. Not to be confused with the name of a possible comeback tour for Savage Garden.Watch on YouTube It seems like a small thing, granted, but a number of players have been caught out, even if they have crossplay activated. Right now, it's unclear if this only affects Xbox players or if players hiding their online status on other platforms are also impacted. Eurogamer can confirm, however, that you can skulk back into the \"show as offline\" shadows once you've successfully connected with your co-op partner. Posts from the playsavageplanet community on Reddit In Eurogamer's Revenge of the Savage Planet review, we called it \"a zany, knockabout co-op action adventure that's kaleidoscopically colourful but wears you out before you get to the good stuff,\" awarding it three out of five stars. \"To me, worlds like these - worlds with cliffs and gorges and rivers and floating islands - come alive when they become playgrounds for the player, when we're allowed to hurtle through them at breakneck speed and with tremendous acrobatic capability, when we can delight in traversal rather than wrestle with it,\" Bertie wrote. \"Revenge of the Savage Planet realises some of that exhilaration later on - although not entirely, I have to say - but it's held back for so long you'll be worn out by the time you get there. I was.\"",
