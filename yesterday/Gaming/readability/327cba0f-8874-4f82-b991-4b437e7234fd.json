If you’re having trouble surviving in this game, don’t worry because we’re here to help with our 7 Days to Live Walkthrough. Table of contentsWhat to do each day in 7 Days to LiveWhat to do each night in 7 Days to Live7 Days to Live Days 1 – 7 Walkthrough What to do each day in 7 Days to Live Currently, there really isn’t much you can do during the day in 7 Days to Live. Regardless, each day, make sure you do the following: Kill at least 2 deer (and gather their meat) Gather as much Wood as you can Make sure you are back in your base before nighttime Screenshot by The Escapist You can also gather Scrap along the way, but it’s not necessary if you just want to survive. It’s extremely important you get back to base before nighttime because if you’re out in the wild, you’ll be cooked. For some reason, as soon as nighttime begins, your character will fall asleep (even if you’re climbing a ladder). When you wake up, you’ll be where you fell, but if you’re out in the woods and can’t see your base, there’s a good chance your game is going to end there. So, keep an eye on that watch (second slot on the hotbar) and get back to base before sundown. If you’re feeling bold, you can also try to take advantage of the events that occur each day, but don’t make it your priority. Keep this up for 7 days, and you should be a-ok. What to do each night in 7 Days to Live Screenshot by The Escapist Just like daytime, nighttime also has it’s own routine. At nighttime you should do the following: Use all your wood to craft walls (either wall is fine, but we prefer the smaller one) Eat until your hunger is full (Cooked Deer Meat) Place your newly crafted walls (During nights 1 – 3) Get to higher ground Kill any monster that pops in for a visit At night, it’s important to stay at your base because your view is limited, and, more importantly, you’re going to get some nasty uninvited guests. To welcome your guests, you need to place proper barricades. During the first few nights, simply climbing on top of your base is good enough to make it until the next day, but when night 4 rolls around, this won’t be enough. A great strategy to work towards is to take two walls and build barricades with a gap that’s big enough for you to fire your gun through. A simple fence also works on the first few enemies, but not for the stronger ones. You should build one such structure by night 4. If you’re running low on wood, remember you can always take apart your main base and use the materials for the barricade. All this aside, don’t forget to eat and stay warm. If you hold Raw Deer Meat next to a fireplace, you can turn it into Cooked Deer Meat. If you place a simple fireplace in your barricade, you’ll be golden. Personally, we always buy the Warm Coat before each match so we have one less thing to worry about, but you can do just fine without one. Once you’ve built a structure you’re satisfied with, you should spend the rest of your time reinforcing the barricades with more layers, for extra protection. We know it seems like a lot, but if you follow this simple formula, you should have no problems making it until day 7 (at least until the game gets updated). 7 Days to Live Days 1 – 7 Walkthrough Screenshot by The Escapist Here’s a quick summary of what to do each day: Day 1: Daily routine, Night: start crafting a simple fence (place a wall so it’s up to your character’s neck) around where you’d like your barricade to be, then head for the roof of your house and survive the night Day 2: Daily routine, Night: try to finish the fence around your barricade, and again, climb on top of your house to survive the night Day 3: Daily routine (and replace any damaged walls if any), Night: start building the top fence (above your character’s head; it should look like in the images), survive the night on the roof Day 4: If you think you won’t be able to finish your barricade, ditch the daily routine and take apart your base for materials. Otherwise, do the daily routine, Night: Hide in your barricade, which should be finished by now, and survive the night Day 5: Repair your barricade and daily routine; Night: Reinforce your barricade and hide inside it until nighttime Days 6 and 7: Repeat Day 5 (fix broken walls, reinforce barricades, survive) That’s all there is to it. Have fun surviving the week until that chopper arrives. Stay up to date with The Escapist for more 7 Days to Live guides. The Escapist is supported by our audience.
