  "text": "Image: NetflixScott Pilgrim series creator Bryan Lee O’Malley announced that the Netflix adaptation of the popular franchise would not receive a second season, confirming what many fans had already assumed.Suggested ReadingNetflix's One Piece Live-Action Trailer Has A Treasure Trove Of Anime Easter EggsOffEnglishSuggested ReadingReleased on Netflix in November 2023, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off is an eight-episode animated series based on O’Malley’s best-selling graphic novels. The show doesn’t directly follow the plot of the novels, but does reunite the cast of the 2010 live-action adaptation to voice their movie characters in the series. Kotaku’s Kenneth Shepard called it a “hilarious blend of the [franchise’s] quick wit and well-measured pop culture references.” But sadly, the series won’t be getting a second season. On November 20, to mark the one-year anniversary of the premiere of Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, series creator O’Malley tweeted that it was “an honor to work with all of the cast \u0026 staff around the world” and called the series “a one of a kind miracle.” The creator also confirmed that Netflix had recently passed on a second season of the animated adaption. “Anyway, we were recently informed that the show will not return,” said O’Malley. “As you know, we only intended one season, and called in a lot of favors to make it happen, so making more would have been nearly impossible. Still, I know some of you have been holding out hope.” “Sorry to all Matthew fans and Gideon fans, I know you will suffer the most,” added O’Malley in a follow-up to the tweet confirming the news that there would be no second season. While some fans were upset with the Netflix show and how much it deviated from the original graphic novels, many others were happy to get a new story featuring these characters. For now, it seems that’s the end of this chapter of the franchise, despite a post-credits scene included in the final episode of Scott Pilgrim Takes Off.  .",
