  "text": "The Site Shall I complain about WordPress.com a bit?  Sure, let’s do that! It isn’t as though they made any huge mistakes this month… unless you count their continued adherence to the idea that their block editor is at all a good idea… it is just that they keep changing things, small things, for the worse.  I am honestly quite convinced they do not use their own product. First, they seemed keen to make it more difficult to find things in the mobile app.  I use that on my iPad when sitting in bed in the mornings or evenings and they have done things like move the alerts icon to a point where you have to navigate to a special place to see if you have any alerts.  It used to be visible throughout the app… which seems like a pretty reasonable thing, as alerts are supposed to alert you and not be hidden in some dark corner. The whole thing smacks of a Google-esque “we’ll make this more organized!” where they clearly have no idea how people actually use their app. They also seem absolutely set on hiding their built-in reader and, if you can find it, making it more and more difficult to use.  It is one of those things where it was about perfect for me two iterations ago.   This applies to both the app and web version of the reader where I like to look at recent posts from my subscription list then posts for a set of tags, like “eve-online” to see if anything new has popped up there. Finally, in the web version they just love to change the navigation.  This is one of those “what do most people want to do?” sorts of questions.  Do they want to go to their admin panel where they can see stats, comments, and posts?  Or do they want to be sent directly to the page about their hosting plan?  I want to go to the admin panel, where I do things many times a day.  WP.com wants me to see the hosting panel, something I think about maybe once a year when the bill is due and change something on the order of once a decade. Now, I am not a complete rube.  I can bookmark my admin panel so I can navigate directly to it.  But I have a couple of active blogs (for specific definitions of “active” maybe) so I do like to be able to move between the two, which used to be a one-click operation.  Then became a two-click move where I had to return to a list of sites first then click on the site.  Now I have to click on the icon that brings me to the site list, click on the site which brings me to the hosting page, and then I have to find a menu for the site and select the admin panel from that. It isn’t even the first option Or, I can find the “My Home” link in the middle of the hosting plan ad, click on that, then click on the admin panel to get to where I want to go. (Edit: And they changed that again since I wrote this, so now it doesn’t go to the stats page, it goes to the general admin panel that used to be the start point for everything way back in the day.) And yes, in the grand scheme of the universe, in a world where being a sexual predator seems to be a requirement to get a cabinet post nomination for the next administration, the fact that I have to click a half dozen more times every day is not the end of the world. But it irks me, as somebody who is now a product manager, who goes to great pains to watch customers use his apps to make sure we’re not actively making things worse for end users, that WP.com is just so oblivious how their app gets used. I guess some MBA decided that if people have to go through the hosting page every day, maybe they’ll spend more money.  That is the only thing approaching logic I can discern here. Once again, I might consider changing hosts, but there are no better options and after 18 years at the same address moving would probably mean losing most of my casual audience. Otherwise November was an okay month.  Traffic was down by 20% compared to October, but ad revenue was still up thanks to the higher quality ads that show up with the holidays.  The hosting fees for my two sites will continue to be covered. (I buy the cheap “no ads” hosting plan for EVE Online pictures, so the dozen people who view it are spared such things.) One Year Ago I set out guessing what we might hear about at BlizzCon 2023.  That was followed by a gut reactions post to the keynote announcements.  There was the whole Season of Discovery thing to explore… though it was NOT Classic Plus.  The Cataclysm Classic announcement was pretty obvious.  And then on the retail front there was The War Within to think about.  It seemed like we might be getting annual retail expansions. I was summing up Hallow’s End and Day of the Dead in WoW Classic and then it was time for another Pilgrim’s Bounty there as well.  I got one final character out of vanilla and up into Wrath Classic.  Meanwhile, the group was attempting the Halls of Reflection. Lord of the Rings Online launched the Corsairs of Umbar expansion. I wrote post on the 19th anniversary of EverQuest II and the game itself launched the Ballads of Zimara expansion. In EVE Online the B2 Coalition in the north collapsed after 18 months of war, which resulted in Brave and a couple other groups joining the Imperium.  As part of the pull back from the north we ended up in a brawl over a Fortizar in Cloud Ring where mistakes were made.  Then we had to get our own stuff out of the north. In the run up to the Havoc expansion, Guristas, having issued a warning, started attacking structures anchored too close to the ancient Jovian stargates.  We were also out in bombers blowing things up in Omist and Perrigen Falls. Then came the Havoc expansion, with new features and odd UI changes.  That got the game over 40K users online… and then it fell over.  Meanwhile, CCP gave up on the EVE Portal App. A day later, Jay Amazingness betrayed the Imperium.  That and the Jovian stargates made it into an edition of The Scope. I also had an EVE Online bullet points post about the new launcher, the 20th anniversary collector’s edition, blockchain nonsense, Empires of EVE II on audio book, and the six hour long Down the Rabbit Hole documentary about EVE Online.  The new launcher was required for EVE Vanguard. Then I went and watched the 6 hour documentary, which got a post on its own. I also looked at October 2023 destruction in the MER. On my telephone tales series, I wrote about Global Village trying to get out of the modem business, some anecdotes from my time there, and then I started off on a tangent about some Usenet CD-ROMs I found stashed away. There was a Friday bullet points post about the death of the Overwatch League, the death of The Escapist, the founding of Second Wind, Pearl Abyss and NCsoft financials, and how the Epic Game Store had remained unprofitable for five years so far. Finally, I wrote briefly about the Kennedy assassination on the 60th anniversary of the event. Five Years Ago Brad McQuaid passed away. Nintendo launched Pokemon Sword \u0026 Shield, the first real core RPG Pokemon games for the Switch. BlizzCon was coming.  There was the apology and the big four announcements (Diablo IV, Shadowlands, Overwatch 2,  and something about Hearthstone).  Even with the pall of Hong Kong hanging over it, it still went better that BlizzCon 2018.  And Hong Kong?  Well, the new security law makes it unlawful for anybody inside or outside of China to criticize the government. No more protest, no more movement, just arrests. World of Warcraft hit its fifteenth anniversary, which made WoW Classic all the more timely.  I charted out my own history with Blizzard and Azeroth. WoW Classic was doing well, driving the biggest quarterly increase in subscriptions in the history of the franchise.  It also moved into Phase 2 of its progression.  The PvP fiasco that followed led to Blizz launching battlegrounds, slated for Phase 3, early. Actually in WoW Classic the instance group took on Shadowfang Keep and the Stormwind Stockades, then started in on Gnomereagn.  We got in a second Gnomeregan run and also went after class quests. I compared the four pending expansions from WoW, EQ, EQII, and LOTRO. Standing Stone Games launched the delayed Minas Morgul expansion. EverQuest II celebrated its fifteenth anniversary. Special servers were on the menu and I recalled my own journey with the game on my own fifteenth anniversary a couple days later.  I also joined in on the dragon event going on in the game.  That led to me playing more and leveling up… and getting side tracked, as tends to happen in Norrath.  But I made it to the level cap and learned to speak dragon along the way. EVE Online got a series of updates, starting with a tiny one regarding login campaigns.  Then there was Team Talos and the Beat Around the Boosh update.  Then we got the Rapid Fire update that came with more Triglavian invasion changes.  And, finally, we got the HyperNet Relay update, which reintroduced gambling… or enhanced scamming… or maybe both… in New Eden. The October MER showed NPC bounties rebounding after the chaos era blackout. CCP had plans for more EVE Aether Wars tests while CCP Falcon left the company. And, actually in in the game, we flew from Delve to Pure Blind to defend some sovereignty and I hit 210 million skill points. Finally, Google Stadia launched and Bobby Kotick was talking up perpetual franchises. Ten Years Ago Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire Launched. There was BlizzCon, about which I made the usual predictions.  I found the event itself vaguely dissatisfying.  But those who were bitching about lack of focus on WoW at BlizzCon 2015, go back and look at how little attention it got in 2014!  Otherwise we were in Azeroth collecting achievements and waiting for the expansion to hit. Oh, yeah, the expansion hit… Warlords of Draenor and server queues and all that.   Blizz was trying to fix that while I had to figure out who to play.  Blizz eventually gave everybody 5 days free for the problems.  But hey, they had 10 million subscribers on the hook again, up from the 7.4 million low point during the summer.  Remember when subscriber numbers were a thing? In EVE Online the Phoebe expansion arrived, bringing with it Jump Fatigue and the 10 year/50 skill long training queue.  Then they were on about removing other annoyances with the upcoming Rhea expansion. In game the Reavers had finished up in Feythabolis with a bang and were off into Omist next, hunting the unwary before returning home again. Rixx Javix was drawing spaceships.  He’s still at it. And there was the This is EVE video that became wildly popular. I reflected on EverQuest II at its 10 year anniversary.  Veterans of the game even got their own island.  Over on the EverQuest side of the house, The Darkened Sea, the 21st expansion for the game, went live. And, finally, the power supply on my computer blew out, taking the motherboard and drives with it.  I had to rebuild, but was up and running again in a couple of days. Fifteen Years Ago I was writing about how I had not changed the blog format since I started.  I have since changed it, though mostly due to the fact that WordPress.com broke the old theme. Our Thanksgiving entertainment was Rock Band 2.  While I was really bad at it, it was a lot of fun.  The next year we played Super Mario Bros. Wii, which I was also really bad at, but which isn’t nearly as much fun.  However, the kids liked it.  I rode along in a bubble most of the time. And while Tech Crunch was exposing the odious practices favored by Mark Pinkus to get FarmVille and Mafia Wars profitable, the New York Times was gushing over this wonderful new virtual goods market, which I summarized and provided links to here. I managed to get some playtime in with the original Torchlight, though there were some problems.  It turns out that if you bought the game from the wrong vendor, you could be a while waiting for patches. The first LEGO Harry Potter game was announced, which I had anticipated would come to pass almost two years before it was announced. Warhammer Online announced that levels 1-10 were going to be free, making me wonder if they were just going to breed a mass of level 1 twinks.  I think that is what the end result was.  Well, there were twinks, but I don’t think the amounted to much of a “mass” in any way. In EVE Online, PLEX was off to a booming start.  The price of a PLEX has risen some since then (~300 million then, well over a billion ISK now in new PLEX).  Meanwhile, the first Hulkageddon was on and even I noticed something was amiss.  Eventually somebody pointed me in the right direction in the comments. I wondered if fishing was really the secret ingredient for MMO success. I got all nostalgic for Star Trek because of Star Trek Online’s impending release. World of Warcraft and EverQuest II both hit their five year anniversaries.  Then I had the temerity to say that there were things that EQII didn’t do very well in my opinion.  Odd how some of those things from a decade back have changed… or how I have changed… or both. On the WoW end of things, somebody was suing because they felt the game wasn’t easy enough. Then there were Mr. T Mohawk grenades and a 24 slot Portable Hole, outrages both along with the $10 vanity pets.  And I was complaining about not getting the Headless Horseman’s mount during Hallow’s End.  Again, sound familiar? I wrote a very short post about Pilgrim’s Bounty which went on to become the most viewed post on the site November of five years ago. And the instance group started in with Ragefire Chasm, Wailing Caverns and Deadmines on the RP-PVP server.  Actual PVP occurred since we had to walk to the Deadmines.  We get called griefers for daring to engage in PVP on a PVP server. Twenty Years Ago Was it really gaming’s greatest month for launches?  WCCF Tech thinks so.  I mean, Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike Source were both launched. As I may have been mentioned, World of Warcraft also launched. Also celebrating a birthday this month was EverQuest II.  It launched a few weeks earlier than WoW and has ever remained in the shadow of both WoW and its older sibling EQ. EVE Online got its second free expansion, Exodus, which introduced player owned starbases… the POS of yore… one of the uses of which was to claim territory in untamed null sec space.  And thus the race to for empires began. Twenty-Five Years Ago Asheron’s Call, the third of the big three break out MMORPGs of the late 90s, launched.  Never as big as its rivals (it peaked at 120K players to Ultima Online’s 250K and EverQuest’s 550K, all very respectable numbers in the pre-WoW era) it blazed its own trail in trying to define what an MMORPG ought to be.  Neglect, a mis-handled sequel, and a studio that made some dubious and costly moves, left the game without a home when Standing Stone Games was split off to support Dungeons \u0026 Dragons Online and Lord of the Rings Online.  Asheron’s Call was officially shut down in January 2017. Thirty Years Ago And on the foundations front, Warcraft: Orcs \u0026 Humans, the first installment in what would become the core Blizzard franchise, launched.  It was not the first RTS or first networked multiplayer game, but it helped make those both a part of the gaming landscape.

Enshrouded – 44.27% EVE Online – 37.40% Stars Reach – 7.67% WoW Classic – 6.22% EverQuest 2.18 2.35% CM:BB – 1.01% World of Warcraft – 0.65% EverQuest II – 0.44% Enshrouded Flavor of the month game in a year that has seen a range of somewhat similar flavors going by.  Still, we were engaged with it to the point of, as Potshot put it, “Staying up until midnight on a work night.”  Usually a sign that we’re into something.  Otherwise it is kind of same-y enough to be comfortable for us to get into and different enough to feel somewhat fresh.  This might have to move from being a “tag” game to a “category” worthy title if we keep going. EVE Online The move ops carry on but I have gotten all my stuff in place.  As usual, once I ramp myself up for something like moving all of my space baggage, once it is done… and it never takes as long as I fear it will… I am left at loose ends, not quite sure what to do with myself.  The alliance is getting all the infrastructure setup but I am waiting on what to do next.  As the month closed out Reavers got up to something, so we’ll see how that plays out. Pokemon Go Closing in on level 47, at least on the xp front.  There is still a task to take care of, but I’ll get to that in another post. Level: 46 (level, 97% of the way to 47, 3 of 4 tasks complete) Pokedex status: 853 (+1) caught, 864 (+1) seen Vivillon Evolutions obtained: 18 of 18! Pokemon I want: Some missing ones from the older Pokedexes Current buddy: Gyarados because I need candies Stars Reach More play tests.  We got space and two more worlds to play on.  All fun, though still a long way from the game presented by the company as their vision.  I do get a bit of an eye roll going when I hear people who should know better suggesting that it is almost done.  Again, have you read the design pillars?  There is still a long road ahead before a game that people will buy… and happily pay a monthly subscription for… will manifest. WoW Classic We were playing a lot of Cataclysm Classic right up until we weren’t.  Isn’t that always the way?  But I was already warning that Cata was starting to wear thin.  I am interested in, disturbed by, and wondering about the parallel paths our group has taken with the classic progression tour versus back in the day.  I suppose we will see if that continues when pandas arrive on the scene. Coming Up It is the last month of the year coming up, which means a host of the usual end of year posts.  Brace yourselves… or whatever you do in anticipation of my annual navel gazing. There will also be a mess of holiday events… CCP was already tooting a week back about the Winter Nexus event landing on December 5th in case you wanted to know… and the Steam Winter Sale and many a like thing. We also seem poised for some Early Access action as, if I read things correctly, both Path of Exile II and Pantheon: Something of the Whatsit are planning to hit that state.  Do I care?  Do you care? The group has been off in Enshrouded, which will likely carry on.  There will be the usual stuff in EVE Online I bet.  And we will see if our group finds anything else to do in Cataclysm Classic.",

similar flavors going by.  Still, we were engaged with it to the point of, as Potshot put it, “Staying up until midnight on a work night.”  Usually a sign that we’re into something.  Otherwise it is kind of same-y enough to be comfortable for us to get into and different enough to feel somewhat fresh.  This might have to move from being a “tag” game to a “category” worthy title if we keep going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEVE Online\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe move ops carry on but I have gotten all my stuff in place.  As usual, once I ramp myself up for something like moving all of my space baggage, once it is done… and it never takes as long as I fear it will… I am left at loose ends, not quite sure what to do with myself.  The alliance is getting all the infrastructure setup but I am waiting on what to do next.  As the month closed out Reavers got up to something, so we’ll see how that plays out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePokemon Go\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing in on level 47, at least on the xp front.  There is still a task to take care of,

vision.  I do get a bit of an eye roll going when I hear people who should know better suggesting that it is almost done.  Again, have you read the design pillars?  There is still a long road ahead before a game that people will buy… and happily pay a monthly subscription for… will manifest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWoW

warning that \u003cem\u003eCata\u003c/em\u003e was starting to wear thin.  I am interested in, disturbed by, and wondering about the parallel paths our group has taken with the classic progression tour versus back in the day.  I suppose we will see if that continues when pandas arrive on the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eComing

of my annual navel gazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere will also be a mess of holiday events… CCP was already tooting a week back about the Winter Nexus event landing on December 5th in case you wanted to know… and the Steam Winter Sale and many a like thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also seem poised for some Early Access action as, if I read things correctly, both \u003cem\u003ePath of Exile II\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003ePantheon: Something of the Whatsit\u003c/em\u003e are planning to hit that state.  Do I care?  Do you care?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group has been off in \u003cem\u003eEnshrouded\u003c/em\u003e, which will likely carry on.  There will be the usual stuff in \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e I bet.  And we will see if our group finds anything else to do in \u003cem\u003eCataclysm Classic\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
