  "text": "Featuring the Great Wave off Kanagawa.This Legend of Zelda canvas wall art is the perfect gift for any Zelda fan. It recreates the timeless Great Wave off Kanagawa by Katsushika Hokusai, but with a fun Wind Waker twist. It's the same exact art, but now Link and the King of Red Lions are sailing in the foreground. It's silly, fun, and a great mash-up of the famous painting and one of the best Zelda games of all time. If you're looking for a great Legend of Zelda gift for yourself or the Nintendo fan in your life, this is definitely worth considering.The Legend of Zelda Great Wave off Kanagawa Canvas There are 16 different versions of the print, with five main configurations. There's regular gallery wrapped, black-framed, 3-piece, 4-piece, and 5-piece versions to pick from, so you have plenty of variety to find the right one for your nerdy interior decorating. Each of the divided versions come in medium and large versions, and the gallery wrapped and black-framed styles come in five sizes. They vary in price between $39.99 and $29.99. The 24 by 18-inch gallery wrapped version is 7% off, now at $69.99 while the 4-piece medium is also 7% off, bringing the price to $129.99. Now is the perfect time to pick one of these up, since The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker has gotten a second wind (nailed it) on Nintendo Switch 2. You can access the game on the Nintendo Switch Online GameCube app along with Soul Calibur 2 and F-Zero GX, with many more to come. The Wind Waker is one of my personal favorites, and we gave the 2002 original a 9.6, saying that it's \"a masterful achievement -- a shining example, in fact, of how video games should be made and a case study for developers wondering what makes a compelling game\".See more Legend of Zelda giftsMyles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.
