  "text": "A beloved classic known for its easy handling and forgivingness is ready to take to the sky in Microsoft Flight Simulator.Born of the Golden Age of Flight:In 1931, in the heart of the Golden Age of Flight, three Brazilian-based aviation pioneers founded Empresa Aeronáutica Ypiranga (EAY), an aircraft company. Their collective dream was to build aircraft that would ultimately be embraced by the growing number of people inspired by the prospect of flight.Their first offering was the EAY-101, an analogue of the DFS Zögling, a German single-seat, high-wing sailplane. EAY then began their next initiative, a powered high-wing airplane that could be used as a trainer as well as a general-purpose flyer. Engineers copied the design of the Taylor Cub, a machine developed and manufactured by the US-based Taylor Aircraft Company. Called the EAY-201, the tandem 2-seat airplane was powered by a French-made Salmson 9AD 40-horsepower radial engine. It performed just as intended: it was easy to take-off, forgiving in the air, and simple to land.The CAP-4 Paulistinha:EAY built just five EAY-201 models before Companhia Aeronáutica Paulista (CAP) purchased the company. CAP took the EAY-201 design and added a more powerful engine to create the CAP-4 Paulistinha. The CAP-4 retained the meaningful traits of the original EAY-201 and added more power, resulting in greater speed and an improved climb rate.The CAP-4 has a fuselage constructed of a steel-tube frame covered in fabric. It features a strut-braced main wing, a standard empennage, and a fixed traditional undercarriage. It measures 21 feet, 10 inches in length, stands 6 feet, 5 inches tall, and has a wingspan of 33 feet, 2 inches. It is powered by a Franklin 4AC 4-cylinder, air-cooled, flat-four piston engine that produces up to 65 horsepower with an engine that turns a fixed-pitch, 2-blade, wood propeller. The aircraft has a range of 310 miles, a service ceiling of 13,000 feet above sea level, and climbs at 610 feet per minute. It cruises at 87 miles per hour and has a top speed of 96 mph.The CAP-4 Paulistinha was used by both civil and military customers for training and a general-purpose light aircraft. Flown primarily in Brazil, the CAP-4 was also exported to Brazil’s South American neighbors of Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay and to Portugal.Ready for Microsoft Flight Simulator Pilots:Microsoft Flight Simulator and its partner, iniBuilds, have beautifully reproduced the CAP-4 Paulistinha for pilots to fly throughout the MSFS world. Aviators will find it wonderfully versatile, equally comfortable operating from the world’s largest airports or from impromptu air strips deep in the backcountry.The Microsoft Flight Simulator CAP-4 Paulistinha comes with six liveries: N505, PP-HCP, PP-HIY, PP-HLJ, PP-TJR, and PT-ZGA. It is one of the four aircraft the team promised to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 consumers as a “make good” for their patience with the issues encountered during the launch. The plane is available for free today to all owners of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024.For those wanting to fly the CAP-4 Paulistinha in Microsoft Flight Simulator, it is available today for $14.99 in the in-sim marketplace.ScreenshotsMicrosoft Flight Simulator and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 are available for Xbox Series X|S and PC with Xbox Game Pass, PC Game Pass, Windows, and Steam, and on Xbox One and supported mobile phones, tablets, and lower-spec PCs via Xbox Cloud Gaming.
