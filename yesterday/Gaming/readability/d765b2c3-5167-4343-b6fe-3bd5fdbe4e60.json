It’ll be the first new mainline Silent Hill game in over a decade and the first game in the series overall since last year’s Silent Hill 2 Remake.It follows a student, Hinako, in 1960s Japan — a first for the psychological horror series typically set in rural America — as the town she lives in is overrun with horrifying enemies only a Silent Hill game could produce. A fog descends, causing the town’s citizens to disappear.Hinako comes across what seem to be her fellow students, now turned into terrifying creatures, as she fights her way out of a school with a pipe as her weapon. She also wields a spear when approaching a shrine and the ominous figure before it, whose face is the stuff of nightmares. According to a PlayStation Blog post, Silent Hill f “will have a heavier focus on melee and be more action-oriented” than the Silent Hill 2 remake.Silent Hill f was originally announced in 2022 and is being developed by the Taiwan-based studio Neobards Entertainment with additional support from Japanese developers. Visual novel fans might want to check it out, as Silent Hill f is being written in part by Ryukishi07.The blog post describes Silent Hill f as a “standalone spinoff,” meaning series veterans and newcomers alike will have their socks scared off by it when Silent Hill f is released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X.",
