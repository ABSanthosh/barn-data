We couldn’t be happier seeing the reactions from players, both young and old(er). It’s warmed the hearts of all the little crew Bots here at Team Asobi HQ.  We have read so many great reviews and received so many positive comments, and it’s been amazing. However, if there was one piece of feedback that came through loud and clear, it was that you wanted more. So rather than put our little robotic feet up just yet, we have been busily beavering away, and we have some new surprises ready for you.As announced in the recent State of Play trailer, starting on October 17 we will be releasing the first of our brand new speedrun levels, Building Speed. These levels will test your platforming skills and alongside an online leaderboard, will give you the chance to compete against all your PlayStation friends. In Building Speed, with the help of Barkster, the bulldog booster, you will blast your way through a sky-high city. Dodge cranes, smash through crates, and even speed through a flying car wash on the way to rescue your stranded crew.Following on from this we will release a brand new speedrun level each week, so by the time you have perfected every jump, hover and spin in one level, a new challenge will await you.  The release schedule is as follows: Oct 17: Building Speed   Oct 24: Let it Slide  Oct 31: Spring-loaded Run  Nov 7: Helium Heights  Nov 14: Rising Heat Note: All Astro Bot updates* from October 17 to November 14 will be available every Thursday at 6:00am PT, 2:00pm BST, and 10:00pm JST. What’s more, each of these new levels contains two brand-new Special Bots for you to rescue. That’s 10 new beloved characters to add to your crew. We gave a sneak peek of Eve from Stellar Blade and the Helldivers. However, as for who is next, well that’s for you to find out. So, get busy rescuing.Lastly, the best thing, it’s all at no extra cost.We want to thank you again for all the love and support you have given to Astro Bot, it means the world to us. That’s all we have for today, however watch this space as there may be even more surprises coming soon.Team Asobi out. *Internet connection and Astro Bot game required for update. Speedrun levels available after game completion. Trending Stories",
