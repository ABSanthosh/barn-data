  "text": "When reimagining Black Iron Prison for a fast-action roguelike dungeon crawler, one of the first things we did was really let our designers run wild with the creatures in the game. We wanted a mix of familiar creatures from TCP and new baddies for players to battle — but everything had to make sense in the crazy comic-inspired future-punk world of [Redacted], which launches on October 31 on PS5. We’ve crammed [Redacted] with enemies, so I’m just gonna share some of the studio’s favorites. First up are Danglers, these guys originated in The Callisto Protocol but we took [Redacted]’s big comic book paintbrush to them.   Danglers usually spawn in packs and crawl toward you, exploding when they get close and dealing serious damage. They’re weak, so stronger weapons can one-shot these guys, and you can use the GRP or kick to knock them into other enemies. Sounds easy right?  Well, In early rooms they’re easy to clear, but they will definitely sneak up on you when things get hectic. And they come in four different flavors. The basic Danglers do an area of effect damage, but the Lightning, Fire, and Cryo versions get a bit tricky – when they’re killed they explode and leave a large electrical, fire, or cryo hazard in their wake. Make sure you don’t box yourself in.  Next there’s the Cybernetic Switcher. They’re completely new for [Redacted].   We dreamed these guys up to force players to change their tactics on the fly. Cybernetic Switchers are fast melee enemies that attack in groups. The catch is that they can alternate blocking melee and ranged attacks – forcing you to change up your combat approach mid-fight. Or, you know, you can just kick them off a ledge, that works too.  The Dasher, as the name suggests, dashes. It’s one of our fastest enemies, dashing from point to point while unleashing melee attacks. There’s also a variant that foregoes melee attacks and leaves grenades in its wake. Their speed makes it hard to pin down and defeat them, so keep moving to avoid their attacks and bully them into submission when there’s an opening. You can also use the GRP to stagger them and get in close to finish them off quickly.  The next three enemies we haven’t even shown before and are located in the final levels of the game, so you know they’re gonna be challenging. And they all work in concert to make those last rooms a hell of a battle – but we’ll give you some tips to get you ready.  The Crazed Prisoners inhabiting the prison are physically weak opponents – but they aren’t necessarily there to hurt you directly as they actively create distance from you. They spread chaos by lobbing gravity grenades into the thick of battle that suck you toward the epicenter which allows other enemies to focus their attacks on a single point. That single point is you.   Dash to break free of the effect or face defeat. I recommend you take these enemies out quickly, but watch your back because the next two enemies we’re looking at are likely there too.  The Robot Shaman isn’t actually magic but it can feel that way sometimes because it buffs surrounding enemies by granting them shields that you have to get through before damaging them.   But the Robot Shaman isn’t without damage-dealing powers. It deploys a large electric dome that deals damage if you’re caught inside. You’ll need to quickly balance handling the newly shielded enemies, staying within striking distance to damage the shaman but not so close you’ll be caught in its electric dome.  And finally, one of the other big bads from The Callisto Protocol, the Two-Head. They’re slow but big and deadly. We tweaked these heavily throughout the game’s development.  The Two-Head evolved from a melee-focused character to a deadly ranged enemy that creates a large area of effect damage with additional damage over time. Oh, and it disorients you for a few seconds. Dodge their ground-pound attacks and get behind them to deal heavier backstab damage to take them down quickly.   I wish I could tell you about all the enemies because we’re just scratching the surface, but there are too many to go over here. The great thing is, if you pre-order for PS5, you can discover and experience them for yourself right this second. Otherwise, [Redacted] launches on October 31 on PS5.   Trending Stories",
