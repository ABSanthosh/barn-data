  "description": "The missions in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl take you all over the Exclusion Zone. Some of these might even have confusing steps, which can lead to headaches. One, in particular, involves your good pal, Richter. Here's our guide on where to find Richter in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl. This is part of a main quest called A Minor Incident.Where to find Richter in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl - A Minor Incident main questThe Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl A Minor Incident main quest happens several hours into the campaign. We don't want to spoil all the details, but this is occurs after a couple of failed assaults on a well-guarded facility. You're tasked with learning the whereabouts of scientists to aid you in your mission. Heading back to Wild IslandSurprisingly, only Richter seems to know where the scientists are. You'll find him lounging around in Rostok Base, which is due west of Slag Heap. However, Richter won't share the details unless you obtain a certain item first.That item is a collar, which should appear marked on your map. It's in the Wild Island region (as you can see in the image above). Getting the collar from the PsydogOnce you reach the location in Wild Island, you'll notice an abandoned building. Your goal now is to take out the Psydog that appears in this area.The Psydog is a mutant with psionic capabilities, allowing it to create clones of itself. You don't want to waste high-caliber ammo on the clones, so just shoot them with a pistol or submachine gun. One bullet is enough to cause them to explode. Once enough clones have been taken out, you'll notice the real Psydog among the pack. Blast it quickly before it creates more clones to confuse you. An issue with Richter's locationLoot the Psydog for the collar. This will cause Richter to call you via radio, saying that you should \"swing by [his] location.\" Now, this is where things get a bit tricky, as we've experienced in our playthrough:We're not sure if it's a user interface (UI) bug, but the quest marker for Richter doesn't appear at all. It's not in the compass or the world map (as you can see in the image above).Moreover, Richter's comment about his coordinates implies that he might be anywhere in the Exclusion Zone. It's going to be a hassle to search for him if that's the case. Hey, Richter's hiding in the shedFunnily enough, Richter is actually inside the shed that's just west of the main building. He's basically a few meters away from where you killed the Psydog. It's a bit weird that he'd contact you via radio when he's fairly close by.As you approach the shed, Richter's quest marker should appear once you're just a few meters away from him. Hand over the collar to complete this quest step. Once you're done, you can tackle the next objective which, thankfully, appears properly on the map.That does it for our guide on where to find Richter in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl. If this is a UI bug, then we hope the issue is fixed in due course to alleviate any confusion.",
