Fantasy Critic League â€“ Like Fantasy Football, but for Video Games As always, I will start off with the state of the scores at last post. The Standings for Week 23 We ended week twenty-three with Bhagpuss solidly in the lead with no expectation that would change as his sixth title, Date Everything! was set to release. Publisher Score Updates Pretty Blue Fox Games (Bhagpuss) Score has gone UP from 75.1 to 85.1 The title had started getting reviews and had been on a downward trend last week, opening at 86.7 and then sagging to 77.5.Â  However, more reviews seem to stabilize the reviews and it was back up to 80 when it released and sits at 81 as I write. That put Bhagpuss further in the lead for now. The rest of the week saw Dune: Awakening changing score as more reviews came in. Dune: Awakening Picked by Crash and Burn Games (Shawn) Counter Picked by Slightly Scuffed Studios (Kluwes)] Score has gone DOWN from 85.0 to 81.9 Dune: Awakening Picked by Crash and Burn Games (Shawn) Counter Picked by Slightly Scuffed Studios (Kluwes)] Score has gone DOWN from 81.7 to 78.6 Dune: Awakening Picked by Crash and Burn Games (Shawn) Counter Picked by Slightly Scuffed Studios (Kluwes)] Score has gone UP from 79.0 to 80.2 With each large score movement there was also a corresponding message about score changes for both Shawn and Kluwes.Â  By the end of the week the score had settled down to 81. Then there were some other small updates that ended up causing one more position swap. Publisher Score Updates Frabjous Day Enterprises (Archey) Moved from 6th place to 5th place Play Forever Mwahahaha (Shintar) Moved from 5th place to 6th place Archey and Shintar are less than a point apart in the standings, so a new review or three showing up can cause that. All of which resulted in the scores as follows. The Standings for Week 24 Bhagpuss, as I have noted a couple times already, is pretty solidly in first place due to the number of releases he has.Â  But the league is also projecting him for first place overall.Â  So we shall have to wait and see who might challenge his position. I, however, remain predicted to fall into last place in the end.Â  That means anything better will be a winâ€¦ or that is how I plan to spin it! There was a change in release dates this week as well. Marathon [Picked by TAGN HQ (Wilhelm)] Release date changed from â€˜Tuesday, September 23, 2025â€™ to â€˜TBAâ€™. I was already starting to doubt the title given some of the reports that have slipped out.Â  Sony pulling back on the release date certainly isnâ€™t a good signâ€¦ which brings us to lineup changes.Â  For bids we had the following this week. Silent Hill f Won by TAGN HQ (Wilhelm) with a bid of $11 Dropped game â€˜Marathonâ€™ conditionally Frabjous Day Enterprises (Archey)â€™s bid of $1 did not succeed: Publisher was outbid. RoboCop: Rogue City â€“ Unfinished Business Won by Frabjous Day Enterprises (Archey) with a bid of $1 The Blood of Dawnwalker Dropped by Rusty Shackleford (Shilgrod) I got out from under Marathon with a conditional drop, swapping it for Silent Hill f, beating out Archey, who did successfully pick up RoboCop.Â  Shilgrod dropped The Blood of the Dawnwalker, which now has a ship date out in 2026. And then there was a counter pick. Ultimate Sheep Raccoon (ðŸŽ¯ Counter Pick) Won by Frabjous Day Enterprises (Archey) with a bid of $5 Archey is going to be disappointed when this turns out to be a 95 score indie title that hauls me back into contentionâ€¦ provided it shipsâ€¦ and it only has a 2025 estimate so far.Â  Also, I am now stuck with it.Â  But I am ready to ride it to the end. Which brings us to what is coming up next week. Coming up for week 25 Death Stranding 2 lands on Thursday.Â  The original was a big hit, so weâ€™ll have to see how the dev team did on trying to capture the essence of the original while delivering something new. Due to some travel needs there might be no week twenty-five report.Â  But nothing is slated to launch from the list until week twenty-seven, so I will catch up some time.
