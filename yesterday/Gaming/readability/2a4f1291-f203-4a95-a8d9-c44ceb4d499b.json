  "text": "We’re still more than 10 days until Christmas and the ghost of Kickstarters past has come to announce that Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen has entered early access on Steam. Which I guess mean that Brad McQuaid has shipped more Kickstarter projects than Mark Jacobs… and Brad passed away five years ago. Still, it has been a decade since the Pantheon Kickstarter campaign launched, then flamed out short of its goal… which probably makes it more impressive that it is going into some form of launch today.  Or maybe it just means that the Kickstarter fad was just the marketing scheme I thought it was and that nobody can develop a game like this for whatever they can raise from random followers. Except for Chris Roberts.  He has clearly made some pact with the devil to get past this. Anyway, enough flippancy.  Early access is here. Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen You can now go over to Steam and give Visionary Realms $40 for which you will receive Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen in some early access form.  The promo pitch: PANTHEON: RISE OF THE FALLEN  IS A DEEPLY SOCIAL HIGH FANTASY MMO  GAME THAT CHALLENGES ITS PLAYERS AND REWARDS EFFORT. It has been 500 years since the Deicide War severed the connection between the people and their gods. The Ravaging Lord pushed nations across Terminus to near extinction before the Dragon King himself appeared and brought an end to the bloodshed. Now, the denizens of Terminus must uncover the mysteries of their past and unlock the silenced power of their gods. For war will come again. And this time the dragons won’t be there to save you. It does a lot of things, or promises to do a lot of things, and comes with some serious caveats… pwipes were mentioned… and has or will have a monthly subscription at some point I think… honestly, they are not really the best at communicating what is going on, though with the state of the game right now that might be by design. Don’t get me wrong.  This game is for somebody… in the way that Shroud of the Avatar was for somebody, just to keep referencing MMO Kickstarter projects from more than a decade back.  It feels like something for a group that needs a hobby game to focus on. I am sure there is an audience out there for a retro style high fantasy MMORPG that falls somewhere between EverQuest and Vanguard: Saga of Heroes when it comes to ambition.  It turns out, I am not one of those people.  I played a couple hours in the closed beta and… it was fine.  It seemed solid.  But it also felt like a 1999 view of the genre, which worked great in 1999. Graphics, performance, and general stability are all better than 25 years ago of course, but there is a pinched, too many details, poor UI element to it that calls back to an earlier era… specifically a pre-WoW era when we would put up with a lot of small windows with tiny numbers in them. But, again, that might just be me.  I have moved on with the genre, so it is possible I can only tolerate 20 year old aesthetics, but that 25 years is too large of a gap for me to cross anymore. The hand of Brad is still clear on the game… in the form of too many options too early in the life of the game.  That is an even dozen classes for early access across a half dozen races… and I bet that was cut back from a larger list. The race/class matrix for Early Access As I pointed out in a past post, WoW after 20 years only has 13 classes, and had just 9 until Wrath of the Lich King… and Blizz had a much larger and well funded development team to get there. But that is just my opinion and I do not plan to spend more time or any money trying to validate it further.  I am perhaps more interested in how they are pushing the envelope with the concept of Early Access with this launch, something I was on about last week with Path of Exile II landing in Early Access. I mentioned this because, when it comes down to it, your Early Access launch is your launch.  There are no do-overs, there is no “this time, but for real,” there is no going back to the well… you get one launch and this is it. That works for some projects that have something to them.  Valheim, still in Early Access after a few years, did very well on that front.  Others… and let’s pick on Mark Jacobs again… like Final Stand: Ragnarok, did poorly then tried to re-launch and did even worse.  I mean, that game has 17 reviews and I’ll bet a few of those are from friends of the dev team… and it is still listed as “mixed.” So this is a roll of the dice, a hope that there is enough there to spark some enthusiasm and a larger following.  But it will need some word of mouth and mentions beyond the small circle of sites that still focus on MMOs. I wish them luck on this journey.",
