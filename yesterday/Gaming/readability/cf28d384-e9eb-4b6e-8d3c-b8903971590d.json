It’s impossible to keep up with everything hitting the digital space, whether it be Premium Video on Demand (PVOD) or a traditional streaming network. With that in mind, we figured it was well past time for us to whip up a little something to help you keep up (and catch up) with all there is to watch in the big, wide world of digital viewing. And thus, the Streaming Rewind was born! We’ll update this list at the end of each week so you can check out what you may have missed, and what’s coming up on the weekend. We’ll keep it a mix of popular releases and noteworthy lesser-known titles to help you find what’s worth taking the risk on as well as dive into a few things that we loved and why we loved ‘em, or just break down a show or movie that left us with some opinions. Sometimes, we’ll even have guest entries from other members of the IGN staff. If you’re not interested in all that and just want to see a bulleted list of what’s out there, pop on down to the New and Noteworthy and ICYMI sections.Novocaine (Paramount+)If you don’t get enough of Jack Quaid getting beat to hell in Prime Video’s The Boys, you can now see even more of it in Novacaine. Quaid stars alongside Prey’s Amber Midthunder as Nate, a boy in love and completely immune to physical pain. Imagine the chagrin of Sherry’s (Midthunder) captors when they realize they’ve kidnapped the wrong girl and found themselves face to face with a seemingly unstoppable force. Of course, the audience knows that while Nate can’t feel pain, he can, in fact, die (it’s in the trailer and everything). While it’s mostly just a tool to add to the suspense, it adds a level of stakes to this otherwise silly and heartfelt flick.Andor Series Finale (Disney+)The beautifully poignant, complex and difficult story of the rise of the rebellion is over, leaving a K-2SO-sized hole in our hearts, but Andor truly was the pinnacle of Star Wars storytelling. While we’ll have to find a way to go on without it, we will always have the impeccable moments it left us with alongside the laughs, tears, and hope it inspired. Though it probably won’t happen for a while, I’ll be over here begging for a Mon Mothma spin-off for the foreseeable future.A Minecraft Movie (Digital and Demand)If you missed it in the theater, A Minecraft Movie is now available from the comfort of your home.
