The trailer itself has its own jumps cares to look out for but doesn’t reveal too much ahead of its premiere, which arrives in a little more than one month. You can see Peter Pan enter the Poohniverse in the trailer below.“The newest entry into the Poohniverse follows Wendy Darling as she strikes out in an attempt to rescue her brother Michael from the clutches of the evil Peter Pan who intends to send him to Neverland,” a description for Peter Pan’s Neverland Nightmare says. “Along the way she meets a twisted Tinkerbell, who is hooked on what she thinks is fairy dust.”Additional plot details have yet to be revealed, but if Peter Pan’s Neverland Nightmare is anything like the Twisted Childhood Universe movies that come before it, fans probably know what to expect. The aforementioned connected universe involves slasher takes on classic IP that have entered public domain. That includes the already released Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey 1 and 2, which see Pooh, Piglet, and others wreaking havoc on unsuspecting victims.Peter Pan’s Neverland Nightmare is far from the first entry in the Twisted Childhood Universe, and it won’t be the last either. Other projects on the way include Bambi: The Reckoning, Pinocchio: Unstrung, and Poohniverse: Monsters Assemble. It’s undeniably tongue-in-cheek, and although fans have argued about each film’s quality – we gave Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey a 4/10 and its sequel a 6/10 – it doesn’t look like these horror takes on classic children’s characters are going anywhere anytime soon.Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey 2Peter Pan’s Neverland Nightmare comes to theaters January 13, 14, and 15.
