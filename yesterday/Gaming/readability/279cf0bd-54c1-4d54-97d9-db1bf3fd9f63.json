Today, he confirmed on Instagram that it was finally happening.\"They called,\" Momoa wrote on Instagram alongside some old comments of his about his wish to play Lobo, in which he said he was just waiting for the invitation.\"So Lobo was... I collect comics, and I don't do so much anymore, but he was always my favorite, and I always wanted to play Lobo, because I'm like, 'Hello? It's the perfect role,'\" Momoa said in the past. \"I mean, listen. If they call and ask me to play him, it's a f*ck yeah. I haven't received that call, so I don't want to put any fake news out there, but if they ever call me and ask me to play, or ask me to audition, I'm there.\"For those unfamiliar, Lobo was created by Roger Slifer and Keith Giffen and first appeared in Omega Men #3 in 1983. His home is a planet called Czarnia and he is a interstellar mercenary and bounty hunter with superhuman strength and immortality. With this casting and the recent Superman trailer, we're starting to get a clearer picture of what James Gunn and Peter Safran's DCU is all about.
