  "text": "Painted Peril follows a magical squirrel as they mix paint colors to defeat living rock monsters in a procedurally generated cave system. The power of color can brighten up a world, but creating ammo based on color and then changing the color of the monsters that you are trying to attack can create a chaotic and fun platformer! Painted Peril does a fantastic job of creating roguelike adventure play where you need to think on your feet and make sure your color is correct. I got to play a demo of the game at Pocket Gamer Connects Helsinki. Playing as Sylvia the Squirrel, you will explore a vast cave system that is full of strange creatures after a meteor strike. Since you are a squirrel, you can climb up walls and jump through areas of the cave, but there is also a painting element in the game. Using your brush, you can steal the colors of the enemies you have near you, but this won’t kill them. You will need to use a different color than the monster to destroy them, which means finding other colors and mixing them to help you fix. Mixing colors can create different spells that have varied effects on the monsters. Also, changing a monster’s color can also change the way they act. This is already a lot to think about and consider, especially considering the combination of colors that there are! Painted Peril quickly becomes a game about managing where you are heading, who you are attacking, and who you are stealing color from. As mentioned, this is a roguelike, so you also can find various items hidden within these caves that can further help you become more powerful. There are shops to spend gems at, allowing you to purchase items that can stack, creating more powerful blasts out of your brush. So far, Painted Peril is a challenging game, but one that feels fun, especially with the procedurally generated caves that keep each playthrough unique. Painted Peril is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can add it to your Steam Wishlist.
