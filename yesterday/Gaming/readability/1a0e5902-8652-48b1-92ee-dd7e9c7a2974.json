  "text": "The Deadseat has you playing games in the back seat of the car, using items pulled from the game world to save you in real life. You’re a child on a long nighttime drive home and your parents are bickering back and forth. You’re hungry, but they seem too caught in their fight to care very much. In fact, they’re so caught up in their fight that they don’t notice that something keeps crawling onto the roof of the car. Or that it is trying to break into the back seat to get their child. Thankfully you’re resourceful AND you have a handheld console game that gives you helpful tools in the ‘real’ world if you collect them within the game world. Juggling the real world and the game world is the hard part, though. Once you collect a camera within the game, you can use it to snap pictures of the beast as it tries to creep into your car, making it flee due to the flash. However, you’ll need to skulk around the world of your video game to find further supplies to keep this thing at bay. For instance, the car needs gas, and you only pick that up within the game by swerving around a track and picking up cans in your path. You can’t exactly pause this game, though, when a two-headed horror starts to gnaw on your head, so you will miss those gas cans as you use the camera to get the monster to back off. Managing several different tasks while scaring off the monster is a stressful tightrope to walk, but you’ll need to if you want to survive this drive. The Deadseat is incredibly stressful to play (especially when you have to start taking the wheel and swerving to avoid monsters in the road on top of everything else, too), stretching you so thin that its scares hit like a truck. But it’s extremely satisfying if you like being startled and having your heart pound out of your chest (especially if you play the Hard Mode campaign that continues the story). The Deadseat is available now on Steam.
