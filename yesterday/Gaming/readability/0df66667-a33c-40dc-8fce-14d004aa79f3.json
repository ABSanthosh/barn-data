Amazon is currently offering a bonus $30 Amazon gift card when you purchase this headphone in Black, Midnight Blue, or Platinum Silver for $448 with free shipping. The WH-1000XM6 builds upon our previous favorite headphone with better sound, but noise cancelation, and better ergonomics.Buy Sony WH-1000XM6 Headphones, Get $30 Amazon Gift CardBonus $30 Amazon Gift CardSony WH-1000XM6 Noise Cancelling Wireless HeadphonesThe Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones replaces the WH-1000XM5 that were released way back in 2022. The three year span makes for more significant improvements than you might think. Both sound quality and noise cancelation have been noticeably improved thanks to a new and more powerful QN3 audio processor and a total of 12 microphones (including 6 beam-forming mics) that do a great job of cancelling out unwanted noise. The XM6 is also easier to stow away than the XM5 because the earcups can be folded inwards and fit in a smaller carrying case. The headphone can last up to 30 hours and it also supports fast charging; a quick 3 minute top-up over USB Type-C will give you up to 3 hours of continuous playback. You can save some money by going with an older generation XM5 or even the XM4, but as long as it is within your budget, the XM6's improvements in sound quality, noise cancelation, and ergonomics makes the new model worth it.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
