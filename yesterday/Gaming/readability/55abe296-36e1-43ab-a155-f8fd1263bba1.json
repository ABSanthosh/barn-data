This upcoming version of the handheld PC will cost $680 and will go on sale on November 18. Suggested ReadingThe Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: June 2023 EditionOffEnglishSuggested ReadingWe’ve said it before, but it’s worth repeating: Valve’s Steam Deck is an awesome piece of hardware. It’s the best and most affordable handheld PC on the market, and since launching in 2022 it’s quickly inspired imitators and changed the way people play games. But the original Steam Deck only came in one color: black. Boring. We need something new and fresh. And Valve is ready to provide that with its newly revealed white and gray Steam Deck. On November 11, Valve announced the limited edition all-white Steam Deck OLED. The device will be available in all Steam Deck shipping regions, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Australia. This new version of the Steam Deck has the same specs as the previously existing OLED, including 1 TB of storage, but also comes with a white carrying case and cleaning cloth. Valve warns that this model will be a limited edition device and that it doesn’t plan on making any more white Steam Decks after this batch is released. “Once we are sold out, we will be sold out,” explained Valve in a news post about the device. You must have a Steam account in good standing that has made at least one purchase before November 2024 to buy the new limited edition all-white Steam Deck. Accounts are restricted to only pre-ordering one device. Valve explained to Eurogamer that this new version of the Steam Deck is another experiment in offering different variants to people around the world. “Last year, we released a smoky translucent limited edition Steam Deck OLED as an experiment to find out if there was interest in alternative colorways (there was!). This is our second experiment along those lines,” said Valve.As someone who was planning to wait to upgrade their Steam Deck until the next major revision, this all-white option is making it hard to stick to that commitment. .",
