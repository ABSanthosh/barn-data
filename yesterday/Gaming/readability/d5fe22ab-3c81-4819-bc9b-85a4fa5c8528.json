  "text": "FBC! Katamari! Deux Ex! More! Image credit: Eurogamer In case you hadn't noticed, what with Switch 2's launch and the annual Summer Geoffs causing all sorts of distractions, June is well and truly upon us. And Sony is marking the occasion - much as it does every month - with a fresh batch of additions to its PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium catalogue, which this time include Control spin-off FBC: Firebreak, Battlefield 2042, and more. Sony's latest catalogue refresh takes place next Tuesday, 17th June, bringing a total of eight new games for PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers, alongside one further addition exclusive to the latter tier. You'll find the full list of June's titles below: PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra: FBC: Firebreak (PS5) Battlefield 2042 (PS4, PS5) Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted 2 (PS5) theHunter: Call of the Wild (PS4) We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie (PS4, PS5) Eiyuden Chronicles: Hundred Heroes (PS4, PS5) Train Sim World 5 (PS4, PS5) Endless Dungeon (PS4, PS5) PlayStation Plus Premium: Deus Ex: The Conspiracy (PS4, PS5) So there're some decent arrivals, then, with highlights including Alan Wake developer Remedy Entertainment's promising co-op Control spin-off FBC: Firebreak, and the ever-delightful We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie. RPG fans, meanwhile, might get a kick out of Suikoden spiritual successor Eiyuden Chronicles: Hundred Heroes, and Amplitude's tower defence roguelike Endless Dungeon is also a good old time. As for those forking out for Sony's top-tier membership, June's retro addition comes in the form of Deus Ex: The Conspiracy - the PlayStation 2 adaptation of developer Ion Storm's cyberpunk immersive sim classic Deux Ex, which first hit the console back in 2002. And that's your lot! All the above don't arrive until next Tuesday, 17th June, meaning you've still got some time to focus on last month's PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra additions before your attention is yanked elsewhere.",
