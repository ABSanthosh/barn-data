  "text": "SummaryOnline mech shooter developed by Pixonic.Now through until December 4 Xbox Insiders can join a limited-time Console Playtest .Build your first mech in three modes, battle on the worlds of the Wild Ten, and unlock a free Daybreak Sparrow Sticker for participating. New worlds are calling! War Robots: Frontiers, a new entry in the smash-hit War Robots series, is coming to Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One in 2025. To celebrate and welcome new Pilots on Xbox, a limited-time Console Playtest is available to Xbox Insiders from November 20 until December 4. Get ready to build your very own mech fleet, squad up with friends, and take the fight to the Wild Ten in this online mech shooter. If you’re new to the War Robots universe, let’s brush up before you jump in the cockpit. Battles Rage on New Worlds Human advancement sees this future-set War Robots game rocket across the stars. The new setting known as the Wild Ten is a collective of planets that Dominions – mega corporations from Earth – are vying for control over, employing mercenary Pilots and their mechanical War Robots as enforcers. From your base of operations on Tortuga, you can accept jobs from Dominions, then go out and battle across these new worlds. Storm the fiery refineries of Catalyst, plunge into the towering industry of Fissure, and traverse the city-spanning Spectrum in six-versus-six online battles. You’ll be beset by dynamic weather as well as enemy teams, so be sure to keep that metal in good shape. Battles can be waged in three modes. Capture points for your team in Warp Rush, go all-out on destruction in Team Deathmatch, and make quick work of the enemy team in Last Robot Standing. You Are the Pilot and the Engineer Build a battle-ready War Robot, finetuned with a massive selection of Pilots, weapons, parts, and abilities. New unlockables can be found in a variety of ways to help you stay on top of new strategies and counters. Different War Robots and combinations can be used to experiment with different combat roles, and play to the strengths of your own personal playstyle. When you’re in the midst of battle, you’ll have to manage the War Robots at your disposal. These mechs don’t come cheap, so respawns are limited. Optimize your fleet and coordinate with friends to give yourself a fighting chance, and adapt to the task at hand and the state of play. Titanic Power Pilots of the Wild Ten have made a new discovery: the Titan, a hulking power-up build with maximum damage in mind. These Robots are much larger and more formidable than their more standard counterparts. They’re powerful, but they also make for a large target. If you can build up enough power to unleash it, you might just turn the tide of battle… or go down in flames. Worth a try either way! Titans come with their own quirks and abilities but have limited use per battle. Deploy wisely, and if you see the enemy team call their own Titan in, take it out with extreme prejudice. Ready to construct your first mech? War Robots: Frontiers is now available to play on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One for Xbox Insiders, with the full game set to launch in 2025.
