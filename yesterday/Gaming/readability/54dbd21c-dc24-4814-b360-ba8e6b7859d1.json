  "text": "Image credit: Infold Games Infinity Nikki developer Papergames earned almost $1 billion in 2024. As spotted by director of research and insights at Niko Partners, Daniel Ahmad, the Chinese firm has been \"credited with the rise of Chinese otome games\" - that is, romance games written primarily for women - both nationally and overseas. Eurogamer's Infinity Nikki review.Watch on YouTube According to Forbes, Papergames - which also developed dating simulator game, Love and Deepspace, which boasts over six million monthly active users and is available in Chinese, English, Japanese and Korean - is so successful, it generated sales of around $850 million worldwide last year, generating a $1.3bn fortune for Papergames' 37-year-old founder, Yao Runhao. Though both developed and published by Papergames in China, in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, Infinity Nikki is published by Fearless, and elsewhere - including the US and Europe - Infinity Nikki is published by Infold Games. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Infinity Nikki - which is the fifth instalment of the dress-up game - will soon make its debut on Steam. Chinese video game company Papergames (Infinity Nikki, Love \u0026 Deepspace) generated nearly $1 billion in 2024. The firm has been credited with the rise of Chinese otome games. Having previously found success in China, it's now seeing global success,https://t.co/rhqPXOivP3— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) February 14, 2025 Infinity Nikki developer Papergames ushered in the new year with word on a range of improvements and optimisations it's working on for the dress-up-themed free-to-play gacha hit. The plans for the open-world action-adventure were formulated after gathering \"millions of suggestions\" from players. A significant chunk of these fall into the \"optimisations\" bucket, starting with improved game performance on mobile devices - which the developer says it recognises as a \"significant challenge that must be addressed\". Our Jessica had good things to say about Infinity Nikki in her four-star review last year, calling it a \"true step forward for open-world gacha games\" that \"finally brings some much needed competition to the miHoYo monopoly\".",
