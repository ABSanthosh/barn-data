We hope you'll join us in continued learning, celebrating and elevating women’s voices. Here's everything to know about Women's History Month and some great ways to celebrate this March. The History Behind Women's History MonthWomen's History Month began as a petition by the National Women’s History Project in 1987, with a purpose to \"celebrate the contributions women have made to the United States and recognize the specific achievements women have made over the course of American history in a variety of fields.\"Did you know Women’s History Month actually began as “Women’s History Week\" during the week of March 7 in 1982? It wasn't until 1987 that this cultural event would become a month-long, national celebration. Efforts continued in order to keep Women's History Month recognized, and every President since 1995 \"have issued a series of annual proclamations designating the month of March as Women’s History Month.”TL;DR - 8 Ways to Celebrate Women's History MonthLearn About Women in History and Share Their StoriesSupport Women-Owned Businesses and ProfessionalsWatch Movies or Shows Directed by WomenRead Books Written by Women AuthorsPlay Games Created by WomenListen to Podcasts Featuring WomenVolunteer at Women-Based OrganizationsDonate to Programs and Organizations Uplifting Women1. Learn About Women in History and Share Their StoriesYou can explore women's stories in history all across the web, from inventors to leaders and beyond. Great places to start include museums and their website archives like Smithsonian, organizations run by women such as StoryCorps, and trusted history-based publishers such as The History Channel.2. Support Women-Owned Businesses and ProfessionalsFrom artists to streamers and beyond, there are so many ways to support women in business. You can shop online from the comfort of your home on sites like Etsy, and browse Women Owned Business Directories like WBD, or FoundedByHer as go-to resources for discovering awesome entrepreneurs. There’s even a way to filter on Amazon to shop women-owned retailers in a variety of categories.In addition to buying from women business owners, supporting women in their career growth is another integral part of the journey to uplift women. SoundGirls is a perfect example of an organization that exists to provide women in the specific industry (audio) an opportunity to \"meet and network with industry professionals, creating a strong support network.” Anything we can do to share women's success stories, contribute, and spread the word around organizations that exist to offer workshops, networking resources, and beyond, can all help support women in business.Also see: 14 Great Women Comic Book Writers.3.

Read Books Written by Women There are so many books written by women to dive into, no matter what your favorite genre is. In fact, according to BookRiot, “Women now publish more than 50% of all books, and have since 2020. The increase in published books by women has also come with a boost for the book industry overall, which boasted a year-on-year increase of 12.3% in 2021 (if you're curious, publishing made $29.3 billion in 2021). With these stats we see what we've already known, really, which is that diversifying the publishing industry is not only the right thing to do, but people also just really like it.”That said, women authors are everywhere, so it's time to get your reading on!
