Lot more science, though. ðŸ˜‚ So, on the one paw, weâ€™re on the cusp of developing a new fusion-powered AI robot that can dispense crunchies, but on the other paw, daily life can be a littleâ€¦boring.

Tabs was hongry today on our walk. Not just hungry, but hongry. He was ravenous!

The only problem is that everyone else has the same idea, so there are also more trespassers and violators of the Tabs the Cat Industries LLC property perimeter. Consequently, sometimes Tabs has to flex his kitty muscles to show â€™em whoâ€™s boss, and heâ€™s always ready to throw down, because you never know when some other cat will attempt a hostile takeover. As Iâ€™m sure you know, the kitty modeling business is cutthroat. The constant threat posed by temperamental turkeys, pushy people, cantankerous kitties and drool-covered dogs keeps Tabs on constant high alert. Sometimes he even jumps at his own shadowâ€¦ But thatâ€™s the kind of diligence it takes to protect a world-class kitty modeling empire. ðŸ™‚ Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen Reader Interactions",
