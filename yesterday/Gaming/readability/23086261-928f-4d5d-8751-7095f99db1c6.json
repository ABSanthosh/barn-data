At today’s Fireside Asher Elias, leader of the Imperium, announced that the coalition would be shifting eastward once more.  The fireside was teased in advance as being a special one, so we had audio up on both Mumble as well as Asher’s Twitch channel. I was expecting to hear about how we would be letting sovereignty in Insmother expand while we turned around to help Brave in Delve, where INIT had been farming Brave and had taken a system. Instead it was announced that the Imperium would be moving east.  Alliances living in Delve and Querious will be moving out of those regions, with Brave filling into Tenerifis, while Goonswarm will be moving forward to live in Insmother, with the new capital system being C-J6MT.  That will put us on the boarder with PanFam. Imperium move plans In addition, the alliance Out of the Blue has joined the Imperium. So move ops are on again.  We will be covering movements out of the western regions while continuing to defend our new holdings in Insmother.  It will be a very busy time even if nothing else happens, and our foes have an opportunity to mess with us.  During the last great move east PanFam put almost no effort into making our moves ops problematic.  Will they wake up this time? This all comes on the heels of CCP putting out an episode of The Scope covering the war in Insmother so far. That is now yesterday’s news, both literally and figuratively. The story of EVE Online moves ever forward.",
