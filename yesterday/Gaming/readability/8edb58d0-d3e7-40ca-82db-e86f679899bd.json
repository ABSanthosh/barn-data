  "text": "Agent 47 is about to become much more dangerous. With Hitman World of Assassination lining up its PS VR2 shot on March 27, Senior Game Designer Eskil Mohl and Lead \u0026 Senior Technical Designer Toke Krainert understood the assignment – and delivered some essential intel on the game. What are some of the cool things players can do now in the game via VR? Eskil: We now have an incredible amount of new interactions. There’s a scene where you get a safe combination and you can visibly read it in your hand. The tactile sensation of actually looking at a note like this feels amazing. Every little set piece in the game before was a button press, and now you actually reach out and touch stuff. We were initially afraid they wouldn’t hold up visually and audibly, so we were nicely surprised. Another one is that you can look away from flashbang grenades. Toke: There are so many ways of playing the game, and I think it just gets better in VR. It opens up that toolbox even more. Eskil:The other day Toke had one thing in his left hand, and another in his right, and he threw them up and caught them. And he suggested he’d try juggling three things – he was like, technically it’s possible, right? How has combat been changed by putting the game into VR? Eskil: It’s significantly improved. Now you can use an items and weapons wheel instead of pausing the game. And with the weapons you feel way more badass. Before putting it in VR, entering combat was almost a fail state because of how often you’d die, but now it’s a lot of fun. You can holster your gun on your back, and you also need to manually eject the magazine, use your other hand to grab a new one, insert it and then ready the weapon. It took a long time to implement, but it’s so rewarding. Was there a temptation to keep all of the game in first-person?   Eskil: Absolutely. For instance, in a scene where you’re stirring soup, we created a first-person prototype, and it felt clunky and a little disorientating. And in other places you couldn’t really get that useful overview of the area you’re in, especially when it comes to knowing where the enemies are. So certain scenes should feel more like a safe spot where you can get a strategic advantage, and it actually felt better in third-person. Did you feel like you had to make more things interactive, given players were now seeing the game world differently? Eskil: Yeah. When you’re in first-person it changes your perception of the game and tactility of what you’re interacting with. But when balancing the game we couldn’t make everything interactive. Toke: We inherited things from the original version of the game, and when I used to be a Level Designer we’d dress locations with items and try to find a good balance of things to pick up. But not all of them, because then you are just littered with props. And if we made everything interactive in VR you would also just have a whole room full of little toy blocks you can throw around. It would be a bit silly!  Did you have to tweak the difficulty balance given the players are now using more tactile and intuitive controls?Eskil: It was a huge worry for me. Now you can dual wield anything, and things like the quick throw feature make you way more lethal and agile.  Toke: But while you have more freedom, you also have more responsibility for the execution of actions that were previously automated. So aiming requires more deliberate motions, reloading takes time, and you have to keep track of where the items are, physically. Eskil: Yeah, so that is probably part of why it levelled itself out, in a way. Were there specific points during development where you felt an ‘Eureka’ moment in the transition to VR? Toke: In the beginning, when we were still figuring out the degree of fidelity in the game, we were prying a crowbar in a door for the first time and it cracked open. Suddenly it felt physical. Like, ‘oh, now it’s a VR game’. That became an indicator for how we did all those other world interactions. Eskil: Yeah, that was a really nice moment. And when we were originally using keys in the game, we initially just had the player hold the key to the door and it would spring open. Then Toke took it to the next level and said we could actually have it so you could put the key in the lock and turn it to open the door. It felt amazing. Have any of your favorite missions changed because of how you experienced it in VR? Toke: For me, it’s probably the train level. It’s very linear. Players had mixed feelings about it and so did I, even though I worked on it, but now that you can play with all of these amazing weapons in VR, it’s just turned into a playground. You’re given one cool weapon after the next, and things to throw around, with a lot of armoured enemies coming at you, so you really have to practice those mechanics. It’s really fun now. Eskil: It’s the sort of level which isn’t a typical Hitman level. It’s a bit too action gamey – but now in VR, it rocks. I had the same feeling in the Colorado section of the game. Players often rate it close to the bottom in popularity. But going gun blazing is so much fun. Hitman World of Assassination launches on PS VR2 March 27. Trending Stories",
