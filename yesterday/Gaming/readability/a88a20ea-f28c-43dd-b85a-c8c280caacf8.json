  "text": "Get a big-screen laptop for less, with a 50-series GPU to boot. Image credit: HP While I have not one but two Windows gaming rigs for testing and writing, they’re both desktops. For working on the go, I use a MacBook Air (boo, hiss), but these HP Omen laptop deals have me considering a swap. HP’s official store has a pair of offerings on sale, but you’ll need to drill down into the build-to-order options to find them. Still, it’s worth the effort. You can save more than a third on the HP Omen 17.3 laptop with a Ryzen 7 350 and RTX 5070 GPU, or 32% off of the more compact HP Omen Slim 16 with an Intel Ultra 7 and that same 5070. Here’s all you need to know. Save on these HP laptops To grab the deal on the Omen 17, you’ll need to opt for the AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 processor and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 GPU. “Full-size, 1-zone RGB backlit, shadow black keyboard with numeric keypad” is the keyboard option to pick, and then MediaTek Wi-Fi 6E MT7922 (2x2) and Bluetooth® 5.3 wireless card for networking. Once that’s done, add it to your cart and use LEVELUP20 as the discount code. This drops the price from $1,980 down to $1,264. https://zdcs.link/aAg3J0 For the HP Omen 16, it works similarly. Pick the Intel Core Ultra 7 255H option, and the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070, then 16 GB of DDR5-5600 RAM. Then it’s 512GB of M.2 storage, and the 16-inch FHD+ display, and that nifty LEVELUP20 code at checkout. If you’ve done it correctly, the $1,860 laptop drops to just $1,248 – a great saving that has me tempted to leave my MacBook behind. This OMEN laptop offers serious power for less than $1,500 if you use the LEVELUP20 code. The Ultra 7 CPU and RTX 5080 combo is wild at this price. Plus, HP’s putting real effort into quality with a 165Hz panel and slick RGB keyboard. It’s ready to roll for competitive gaming or just flexing in your setup. Looking to go all out? This config doesn’t mess around. With an Ultra 9 CPU, RTX 5090, and that signature OMEN style, it’s basically a desktop crammed into a portable shell. The $1,200+ discount sweetens the deal even more, especially with 24GB of GPU power and a stunning 1200p display onboard. This 35L tower punches way above its price. You’re getting an RTX 5080, 32GB RAM, and plenty of horsepower for 1440p or 4K gaming. Plus, since it’s prebuilt by HP, it’s plug in and play—no faffing around with components. A seriously solid option for anyone after high-end performance without the DIY. The 45L rig is pure chaos—in the best way. Ultra 9 285K, RTX 5090 with 32GB VRAM, and a ridiculous 64GB of RGB DDR5. It scoffs at ultra settings and just dominates. You’re paying for top-tier gear, but this is the kind of system that turns heads and obliterates benchmarks.",
