  "text": "And there's a beta test this month too! Image credit: Wolfpack Games I know we're all about PC games, but none of you will mind if I reminisce about how good PS2 games were, would you? Good, because they were! And Havenhold, the debut game from the Beijing based Wolfpack Games, looks like it could quite easily be one, even if it has some modern sensibilities in places. You play as a Taichu warrior monk, fighting against other players as you all vye for the top of a special mountain, with the catch being that the game's world completely resets every 14 days. Gameplay wise, it looks to be a pretty solid action game complete with dodging, parrying, elemental abilities. Nothing that necessarily stands out on its own, but it looks pretty tight here as a complete package, and I'm a fan of how your visage transforms depending on the element that you're using. As you try to make your way to the top of the game's main mountain, Kunlun, you'll find dungeons, ruins, temples, that sorta thing, where you can learn new abilities and find blueprints to make gear and weapons. Havenhold Game Overview Trailer Watch on YouTube For me, the main appeal is in the game's cycle system. I love time-based pressure games like The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask and Unsighted, so to see a game like Havenhold explore that across two weeks feels like a cool concept. The whole game is PvP generally, but you might be sometimes forced to fight tougher enemies with others, so the whole thing is kind of like one really long Fortnite match you can dip in and out of. I like it! Don't worry though, you keep items and powers over into new cycles, so you don't lose out completely. There's a closed beta test taking place later this month on April 17th too, which you can sign-up to try out through the game's Steam page here. It's also planned to launch into early access sometime this year, though no word on when that'll be just yet.",
