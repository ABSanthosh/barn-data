  "text": "SummaryIron Meat’s first major update adds a whole new layer of gameplay with Mirror Mode.Picking up a Supercharge or third copy of a weapon upgrade will now turn bullets red.Added visual background updates, weapon buffs, keeping extra lives, and more to chew on. Following the success of Iron Meat’s launch back in September, the team at Retroware has been hard at work charting the path forward with planning major content updates to their modern retro gem! With the first major update arriving on Xbox, you can experience a fine platter of new content to sink your teeth into! Mirror, Mirror One of the highly requested new features in the game is Mirror Mode–an option that lets you run through every level, but this time to the left! While flipping the x-axis may seem like a trivial update, facing every enemy, every boss, and every level becomes a whole new experience. Players can unlock this mode after beating the game for the first time on any difficulty! Red Rapid Fire A second new feature is the automatic Supercharge upgrade–or the “third” tier of possible weapon upgrades. With the Supercharge upgrade active on a player, all of that player’s projectiles will now have a red coloration, instead of maintaining their blue or green colors, regardless of their current upgrade tier. So, if a player has one or two guns that are fully upgraded (as in, they fire green projectiles instead of blue), they can try to pick up a third copy of that gun(s) and be rewarded with an automatic Supercharge (Rapid Fire) upgrade, coupled together with a new red color for their projectiles! My 1UPs, Thank You With this first major update, we’re happy to announce that all extra lives players earn while playing through a level will be kept as you start a new level. In other words, you now get to keep extra lives if you finish a level with more lives than you started with. Visual Enhancements to Level Backgrounds We’ve gone back to the backgrounds of certain levels and added in some more details that we believe will really drive home some of the unspoken narrative points relevant to Iron Meat’s story. Some of these new details include: adding a brief section where the helicopter flies in shooting down at Meat monsters on Forest, adding in spikes to the midboss on Base, adding in surviving pilots to the ending credits animation, and explosive impacts from the Meat meteors on Train. Other Updates In addition to minor bug fixes on the backend, we’ve also: Buffed the default damage dealt by the “E”, “U”, and “M” guns. Added more Meat to different sections of the Moon Base. Retooled certain patterns of the MI-24 helicopter boss fight to be more clear. And slightly changed sections of all levels to be more fair to the player (for example: Meat worms are now killable on Base the second they appear, the Meat Mouth Doors on Train are now killable, and other minor fixes). We wanted to give players a taste of what we’ve got in store for Iron Meat’s future, and we can’t wait to share even more new content with updates later down the line! Iron Meat is available now! Iron Meat is a fast-paced, run-and-gun shooter that immerses players in a world overrun by The Meat–an all-consuming interdimensional biomass. With a mix of classic arcade and console mechanics, players will battle against mutated victims and machines, dodge bullet barrages, and crush bosses in nine levels of gore-ific brutality. As Vadim, fight back against The Meat and stop the terrors spawned from scientist Yuri Markov's experiments on the Moon. MULTI-PHASE BOSS FIGHTS Iron Meat pays homage to classic run-and-gun titles from the past, with intense boss fights fixed into multiple phases. With three difficulty settings to choose from, players can put their skills to the test, where a higher difficulty is rewarded with an even more challenging boss battle. MULTIPLAYER COUCH CO-OP Who says you have to take on The Meat invasion alone? With 2-player couch co-op, you can grab a buddy to leave a trail of bloody, Meat-infected corpses together! It's double the firepower, double the carnage, and double the MEAT! OVER 30 UNLOCKABLE SKINS You don't have to be a soldier to fight against The Meat. Hell, you don't even have to be a HUMAN to do so! With over 30 unlockable skins to choose from, players can customize their character the way they want. Each skin comes with interchangeable parts, allowing for greater customization with mixing and matching. Want a shark head on a robot body with dinosaur feet? DONE. Maybe a half human, half doggo? YOU BET! Or how about a cowboy with a tail and demon wings? Hmm…YEP!",
