The debut game from visionary indie developer Meatspace Interactive, published by nDreams, this frenetic puzzle-shooter pays bombastic homage to classic action cinema, set to a pulsing synthetic soundtrack. Alongside what makes Vendetta Forever so special, today we want to show off some new PS VR2 gameplay and reveal the features players can enjoy when the title launches this Thursday on PS5. Come on baby, do the Lo-Kill-Motion Shoot to kill. Kill to move. Lo-Kill-Motion is the new mechanic that propels players acrobatically through Vendetta Forever’s maze-like arenas. Take down enemies, seize their weapons in mid-air, and take their place. Rinse, repeat, and reload. Each scene is loaded with iconic weaponry, spanning the all-time classics to the deviously improvised. Whether you’re scoped in with a sniper rifle or flinging a humble pencil (seriously), you’ll always have an outrageous arsenal at your disposal. Harnessing the immersion of PS VR2 We loved digging into the possibilities of the PS VR2 hardware and Vendetta Forever is full of features to maximise your stylish shooting immersion. Feel subtle differences between some of the least subtle weapons in the business. Every weapon in the game – from agile silenced pistols to hefty rocket launchers – will handle differently thanks to the Sense controller’s adaptive triggers. Immersion is maximized through the Sense controller haptics and headset feedback, allowing you to feel incoming damage and death-defying explosions. PS VR2 players can enjoy a few visual perks as well. Your view is mirrored on the TV at 4K, with a stabilized camera for optimal spectating and streaming your wildest moments. In-game you can enjoy real-time shadows, dialed-up lighting, and post-processing.  A behind-the-scenes peek at some early scene compositions Vendetta Forever comes from the idiosyncratic game design brain of MeatSpace Interactive’s founder and solo indie developer, Zander Dejah. Zander’s well familiar with the power of PlayStation hardware. Having worked on Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy’s Edge and Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series, he’s experienced at crafting immersive VR worlds. For Vendetta Forever, this is a labour of love that goes all-in on gunplay purity. It’s unapologetically the game this VR fanatic dreamt of making – focused entirely on making the player feel really damn good. “From day one, the goal with Vendetta Forever was to craft all-action scenes that put player power at the centre of everything, rather than lengthy cinematics or dialogue scenes. This game is about fulfilling that ultimate player fantasy of starring in their own action movie show-stopping vignettes. It’s fast-paced, rewards strategic thinking on the fly, and achieves that sense of shooter flow state in VR. After working on some narrative heavy hitters in the past, this game has really been the opportunity to make the hyperactive shooter experience I’ve always wanted to play. It’s VR-first and when it comes to immersion, ‘feel’ beats ‘real’ for me. I think it’s an experience frenetic shooter fans have been craving and I can’t wait for PS VR2 players to dive in.” – Zander Dejah, MeatSpace Interactive 10% off pre-orders with PlayStation Plus Get prepped for cult action paradise with a 10% pre-order discount, exclusively for PlayStation Plus members!
