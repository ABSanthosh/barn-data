Welcome to Enshrouded But we’re thinking of starting again. An astute observer may have noticed that, while our WoW Classic group has consistently been a four player operation for most of it duration, I have only ever mentioned three of us in Enshrouded.  Mike, our fourth, has had a lot going on in real life and hasn’t had free time on the weekends to join in.  So our whole run has been without him. However, his time is starting to clear and he’ll have time to play soon enough.  But we’re still months away from Mists of Pandaria Classic and still digging Enshrouded, so the plan is to start over.  A complete refresh, restarting the world and everybody starting with a fresh character. Here’s the thing.  Enshrouded isn’t Valheim.  Starting over again doesn’t automatically mean a different experience. The problem is that the hand crafted world of the game, which has so much going on and is one of the main attractions of the game… it stays the same.  There is no randomized layout or procedural generation.  Every shroud root, elixir well, abandoned town, mud pit, boss, or watering hole will be in exactly the same spot when we start anew. That isn’t the worst thing ever.  The world of Enshrouded is pretty big and we haven’t memorized every square inch of it.  And there is more coming.  Keen has content updates still in the plans between now and the end of early access next year. But the new stuff is still a ways out likely, though we’re supposed to get some news on that soon. So we are considering what we might do, if anything, to keep game play fresh. We can certainly go different places on the skill tree.  There are a wide range of options.  I went hard on the tanking and shield skills and anything that gave me hit points.  That is often my comfort zone.  But there are different archetypes to try, and you can mix and match quite a bit with enough skill points. There are a range of server parameters that can be tinkered with as well, things that affect mobs, how many there are, how hard they hit, how many attack you at any given time, what their aggro radius is, and how much xp they give.  You can also adjust your shroud timer or your cold weather timer.  So there are some mechanics that can be adjusted, some dials that can be turned. I am just not sure what would be to the best effect. And then there is base building, an important aspect of the game.  The location we chose this time around was fine, but it was also pretty close to a spire.  I think with the ghost glider upgrade you could fly over out base.  Strategically, it feels like we ought to not waste a fast travel point so close to a spire, so we could start thinking on a new place to setup shop. So those are the things I am pondering, but I am certainly interested in any suggestions on how to mix things up without cranking things up too much to keep somebody just joining in from having fun.",
