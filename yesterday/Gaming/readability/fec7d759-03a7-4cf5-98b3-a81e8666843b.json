As someone who often plays games on my phone, there are just a lot of those kinds of games out there. When I heard that this game was a mix of match-3, adventure, and mythology, I wasn’t prepared for how good the whole thing would feel as it brought those elements together. Mythmatch is a game based on Greek mythology with some comic book-style art to tell stories between the various levels. These stories follow an anti-capitalism theme, with the main hero standing up against the gods of Olympus. In the little demo that I played at Develop: Brighton, my character was looking for a job, and being told that they couldn’t have specific jobs because, seemingly, they were a Goddess, not a God. In the actual gameplay, you will find yourself grabbing items and throwing them together, sometimes using your bow and arrow to grab stuff that is across bigger gaps. Often, these levels have something producing some of the objects you can match up and creatures moving around, which can make it more difficult to make your matches. The movement, however, feels really fantastic as you play. Crafting new creatures or materials in Mythmatch is how you progress the story and find new places to explore. I found it both challenging and fun that more items were appearing on-screen and moving around. Often, I needed to try really hard to get the items to match up just due to all the movement. Match-3 games often all feel the same, but there is something fun and unique about Mythmatch so I’ll be keeping my eye out for the full game! Mythmatch is currently in development, but in the meantime you can grab a demo and add it to your wishlist on Steam.
