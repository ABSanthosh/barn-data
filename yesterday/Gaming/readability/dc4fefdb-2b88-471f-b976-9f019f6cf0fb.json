  "text": "Image credit: EA Fresh Battlefield 6 details have emerged from a reliable leaker ahead of its big trailer reveal tomorrow, including word the latest instalment of EA's beleaguered shooter series is eyeing up an October release date and an €80 price tag on consoles. That's according to Dealabs' consistently reliable Billbil-kun, whose sources claim Battlefield 6's previously rumoured 10th October release date is accurate, and that the game will launch for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S in both Standard and Phantom Edition forms - costing €79.99 and €109.99 respectively on consoles and €10 less on PC. As to what the Phantom Edition actually is, it's supposedly a digital-only special edition featuring unspecified in-game content, which Standard Edition owners can upgrade to at any time via a €29.99 Phantom Pack. It's also claimed there'll be no early access with any version. Battlefield 6 pre-orders will reportedly open next Thursday, 31st July, one week after the game's grand trailer unveiling, which is officially scheduled to take place tomorrow, 24th July, at 4PM BST/8AM PST. This, of course, should also be the point we find out if all of the above is true. We already know some of what to expect, of course, thanks to various playtest leaks and EA's early confirmation Battlefield 6 would feature a modern-day setting, classes, and more. It's going to have to be a pretty special, however, if the publisher has any hope of reaching itsreported 100m player target across Battlefield 6's main game and a separate free-to-play battle royale - a particularly lofty goal after the disastrous Battlefield 2042.",
