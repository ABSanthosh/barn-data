  "text": "Screenshot: Xbox / ObsidianA new update is now live for Avowed, Obsidian’s recently released and very good open-world RPG. The patch is live on Xbox and PC and it fixes a lot of tiny bugs and other issues. But the biggest news is that all players will now be a bit more powerful thanks to some extra upgrade points. Suggested ReadingLive Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'Suggested ReadingOn March 13, Obsidian released patch 1.3 for Avowed on both Xbox and PC. Alongside the update, Obsidian published a massive patch notes post that outlines all the various changes, fixes, and tweaks. The list is so big that Obsidian had to split it. Heck, it’s so big that I couldn’t even fit the entire thing in this post. Given its size and the fact that it contains some spoilers, instead, I’ve just included the spoiler-free highlights. And the best news is that players will now receive an additional talent point at levels 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30. Don’t worry if you’ve already leveled up past these milestones, as the extra points are being given out retroactively, too. I loved Avowed, but I did feel like it was a bit stingy with talent points which let you unlock and upgrade new abilities and spells. These six extra points will help out a lot!Also buried in the massive patch notes post is a hint from Obsidian about future updates. The developer says that in the coming weeks it will release a roadmap for Avowed that will share some of the plans the studio has for the game over the next year or so. Will we get a confirmation of DLC? Or a new talent tree? I hope so, as I want more Avowed to play! Anyway, here are the non-spoiler patch notes for Avowed’s latest update.
