  "text": "Seriously, I mean it this time Image credit: Square Enix I'm sure like me, some of you would really like another Nier game. A Nier 3, if you will, except I won't, because it already came out and it was called Nier Reincarnation. Unfortunately it was also a free-to-play mobile game, and as most mobile games are destined for, it shut down last year rendering it completely unplayable. Nier celebrated its 15th anniversary this year, so far with no big announcements, though there is a new website that's slowly sharing bits of a special novel. And curiously enough, it appears to be teasing something Nier Reincarnation related. As spotted by journalist Willa Rowe (thanks, IGN), the website is doing something a bit odd. At the end of the most recently released chapter, there's some kind of computer log, a cryptic bit of text that specifically references the official Japanese website for Nier Reincarnation. In fact the specific wording leading up to the link to said website says \"recovery protocol initialised.\" There's even some lore stuff teased when you right click and view page source, referencing characters called Her and Him that appeared in Reincarnation, as well as a reference to The Cage, the main setting of the game. It's all a bit odd, suitably Yoko Taro, and of course has me and everyone else hoping that this is suggesting some kind of Nier Reincarnation re-release/ port is on the way. Here's the thing Square Enix: I'd really like it if you did that. I didn't manage to catch up to the RPG's main story in time, and even if I put all of the combat stuff on autopilot it's just not the same watching cutscene compilations on YouTube. We can only assume that some kind of Nier project will be coming, some time, eventually, maybe, though it would be nice for an actual bit of news. Or, like, a Nier Automata re-release with an equally annoying name to write as Nier Replicant ver. 1.22 blah blah blah's that adds a lore critical sword or whatever.",
