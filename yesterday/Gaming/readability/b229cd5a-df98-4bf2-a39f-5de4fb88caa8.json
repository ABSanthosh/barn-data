  "text": "SummaryTony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 launches for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Battle.net, Windows PC, Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on July 11 – and it’ll arrive day one with Game Pass Ultimate \u0026 PC Game Pass.This new game is faithfully remade from the ground up, adding new skaters, new parks, new music, and much more.Pre-order today to access the Foundry Demo in June – or pre-order the Digital Deluxe Edition for three days of Early Access, Doom Slayer \u0026 Revanant playable skaters, and more. The Birdman returns on July 11 – Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 is back. Launching on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Battle.net, Windows PC, Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, and available day one with Game Pass, THPS 3+4 is at once a faithful remake of the original classic skateboarding games, but expands on the experience with new parks, skaters, and music, as well as cross-platform multiplayer, new creation tools, a New Game+ mode, and more. Rebuilt from the ground up, THPS 3+4 will include parks from the original games as well as new locations (more on that later), plus a Career Mode that includes the original tours from both. Playing with friends? Cross-platform multiplayer supports up to 8 skaters at one time, meaning you’ll have plenty of competition. Multiple new skaters are joining the original line-up, and you’ll also be able to create your own skater, not only customizing their appearance, but their hometown, skating style, and more. And of course, no Tony Hawk game would be complete without music, and you’ll be skating along to tracks from the original soundtrack, as well as new tracks. THPS 3+4 builds on the work started by Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2, bringing the easy-to-learn, hard-to-master controls and handling you’d expect – and for those taking on the series for the first time, an in-depth tutorial from Tony Hawk himself will walk you through exactly how to play. Welcome to Waterpark You may have caught a glimpse of an unfamiliar location in today’s reveal trailer – this is Waterpark, a new level added to THPS 3+4. Introduced as part of the revamped THPS 4 Tour, this is a broken-down, dried-out park in the heart of the Mojave desert – perfect for budding skaters. The rides might not be functional any more, but they’re more than open for finding lines and trick opportunities. Six rides are open for you to try and trick off of – Down the Drain, Peak Cyclone, Twisted Vipers and more offer challenging trips down to ground level. Just skate to the entrance of each one, and you’ll be transported to the top to try your luck. If you’re looking for something a little more chill, take a trip down the Lazy River, which snakes around the entire map, head to the Marquee for a ramp-filled area perfect for combos, or find a way to open up the Castle Slide for even more opportunities to earn points. Pre-Order Now for Early Access and More Pre-orders for Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 open today, and will give you access to the Foundry Demo (not available on Nintendo Switch). Kicking off in June, this demo will include two skaters and two parks to try out – and your pre-order will also net you an extra in-game shader for Tony Hawk at full game launch. Pre-ordering the Digital Deluxe Edition will give you three days of Early Access to the full game – as well as some far more unexpected bonuses. Play as both the Doom Slayer (with two outfits, two unique tricks, and a hoverboard) or a Revenant (with its own two unique tricks), not to mention themed skate decks, Create-a-Skater items and bonus soundtracks. And if you want to go all-out, the Collector’s Edition of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 will come complete with a limited-edition, full-size Birdhouse skateboard deck (deck-only, other skateboard components not included) featuring a reissued version of the iconic Wings graphic and a printed Tony Hawk autograph. The Collector’s Edition includes a physical copy of the game, and all the Digital Deluxe Edition benefits. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 launches on July 11. Pre-orders open today.
