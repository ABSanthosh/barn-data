  "text": "\"Our officers had a 'What the frag?!?' moment.\" Image credit: TSA / Facebook / Eurogamer A Call of Duty fan had a run-in with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) after trying to get a \"replica explosive device\" Monkey Bomb onto a plane in the US earlier this year. The figurine - styled on the in-game version which is used to distract enemies - was showcased online after the organisation shared a number of its more memorable contraband seizes on social media. Verdansk Launch Trailer | Call of Duty: Warzone Verdansk Launch Trailer | Call of Duty: Warzone.Watch on YouTube \"Our officers at Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) had a 'What the frag?!?' moment when they discovered this replica explosive device in a passenger's checked bag,\" the TSA quipped in a Facebook post, sharing an image that appears to show a phone holder and charger (thanks, Dexerto). \"This monkey may rack up points in a game, but in real life, leave the gear for your loadout screen, not your baggage. Replica weapons and explosives, no matter how cool or collectible, aren't allowed in either carry-on or checked baggage.\" The post racked up thousands of responses, with many taking umbrage with the organisation's decision to seize it. \"So basically, you took a child's toy. If it's not real, did you only take it to post on Facebook?\" asked one. Earlier this month, Activision confirmed it was amending crossplay functionality in Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Season 3 to allow players to restrict matchmaking to consoles only. Effectively, this means console players can turn off crossplay with PC players across all the game's major multiplayer modes in an effort to limit cheating. While removing crossplay was already available in the game's ranked modes, the new options will extend this to all multiplayer modes.",
