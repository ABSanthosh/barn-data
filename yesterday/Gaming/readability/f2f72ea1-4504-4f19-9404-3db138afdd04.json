While official information is still scarce, here’s everything we know about Black Ops 7. Setting and Story While the last several Call of Duty games have elected to stick to historical or modern settings, Black Ops 7 is heading back to the future. Despite being numbered to follow 2024’s Black Ops 6, the latest CoD actually has way more in common with the classic Black Ops 2. Like Black Ops 2, 7 will take players a decade ahead of the game’s release and predict a near future full of technology which revolutionizes the way wars are fought. Black Ops 7 takes place in 2035, with characters from Black Ops 2 returning in the form of David Mason, Menendez, and Harper. The announcement blog further teases the setting as a “world on the brink of chaos, ravaged by violent conflict and psychological warfare”. While story details are still being kept classified, the cryptic teaser does give fans a taste of what to expect. That trailer is filled with surreal, mind bending environments which confirm the spirit of Black Ops as a trippy espionage thriller is still alive and well. Several of these aforementioned locales allude back to classic characters and missions from early Black Ops campaigns. Most notably, David Mason confronts Raul Menendez in a recreation of the room has father was interrogated in over the course of the original Black Ops story. Multiplayer, Zombies, and More As exciting as a new Black Ops Campaign can be, Call of Duty’s suite of multiplayer modes is what keeps players hooked all year. That being said, the Campaign does actually fit in here, too. Perhaps whats most exciting about Black Ops 7’s story is that fans will be able to experience it with others. In a rare move for the franchise, this year’s campaign is confirmed to be playable co-op or solo, allowing fans to play the narrative out together for the first time in a decade. For fans of Call of Duty’s PvP offerings, Black Ops 7 is expected to have the classic Multiplayer modes, as well as some new ones. Black Ops 7 will continue the trend of a direct sequel to a previous Call of Duty entry in an odd numbered year; just as Modern Warfare III followed up II the year before it. However, unlike MWIII, Black Ops 7 is confirmed to have several brand-new Multiplayer maps at launch, rather than just a collection of remasters. The seasons of Warzone content to follow the Black Ops 7 launch seem to feature a new large-scale map called Avalon. Several prominent CoD content leakers have claimed Avalon was originally set to release with Black Ops 6, but was delayed too make room for the re-introduction of Verdansk. Several of the Black Ops 6 Multiplayer maps take place in or around Avalon, and the surrounding area matches up with some brief looks at gameplay in the first Black Ops 7 teaser. A brief look at this year’s Zombies offering was also shown. Black Ops 7 will once again feature the classic Round Based Zombies mode. Our first look at the horde mode this year shows a group of zombies being alerted by the turning on of headlights in a rural environment. Many fans believe this could be some sort of remake or reimagining of Tranzit, the launch map for Black Ops 2 Zombies, as the teaser images seem to include that map’s Farm locale and bus. Fans have long wanted a reinvention of the controversial map on new hardware, and with Black Ops 7 being a direct sequel to 2, the time may finally be right. A full reveal of Black Ops 7 is promised for this summer. In the meantime, you can play Black Ops 6 \u0026 Warzone on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. Black Ops 7 will be available on all those platforms as well. It is unknown if and when the game will come to the Nintendo Switch 2. The Escapist is supported by our audience.
