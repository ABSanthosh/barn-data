  "text": "Fantasy Zoo allows players to gather monsters, ghosts, giants, and other mythical creatures into a zoo to dazzle the public. There have been lots of zoo and amusement park games within the last few years, so even though Fantasy Zoo lets you fill its pens with undead, pop culture creatures, and other oddball animals, it felt both familiar and new at the same time. It might be the strange characters that drew me in, but the ability to easily create a fun zoo kept me playing. Fantasy Zoo puts you in the role of a powerful wizard that is building a zoo for all types of fantasy animals. This zoo can be home to a bunch of unique and strange creatures (from ice blobs to giant spiders to skeletons) as long as you take care of them. Each of these creatures how their own needs and requirements for their enclosure, which you will need to uphold. After all, some (most) are quite dangerous. When it comes to larger, more powerful creatures, you will also need to ensure that their enclosures are strong enough to keep them in. Otherwise, you might have a lawsuit on your hands. You can use magical crystals to stop creatures from escaping. However, your magic is limited, so you do need to make sure you are managing it. Fantasy Zoo has all of the other classic zoo management features from hiring people to work at your zoo to ensuring people visiting have everything they need. Your main goal is to gain gold and continue expanding as people enjoy your zoo. I got the chance to play Fantasy Zoo at Pocket Gamer Connects Helsinki, where I found the interesting characters to be quite fun! The game has been out for some time now and I do feel the graphics could use a bit of a refresh, but if you’re a fan of zoo management games and are looking for something a little spooky, this game is a great option. Fantasy Zoo is available now on Steam.
