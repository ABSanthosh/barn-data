  "text": "Expansion season for the Enad Global 7 MMORPGs kicks off in earnest today as Lord of the Rings Online launches its latest expansion, Legacy of Morgoth. It is in the appendix somewhere! The pitch for this… and we are clearly getting to the hairy edge of what was covered in anything  but oblique references deep in the long appendix of the trilogy to which SSG is constrained… is as follows: Unearth the Secrets of Shagana Venture into the untamed wilds of Near Harad, where ancient secrets lurk beneath sun-scorched sands and treacherous marshlands! Feel the thrill of discovery as you race against time, deciphering cryptic maps and forging unlikely alliances. In this land of hidden perils and breathtaking vistas, your choices will shape the fate of Middle-earth. With courage as your compass, pursue cunning traitors through scorching deserts, petrified forests, and wind-carved canyons. Stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the fierce and enigmatic peoples of this land to prevent against a coming darkness more terrifying than Mordor’s shadow. For in these mysterious lands awaits something that few would have dreamed in their most terrible of nightmares: the Legacy of Morgoth. The game is headed south from Umbar to Near Harad.  I mean, technically, we might even find the two missing istari mentioned in a footnote somewhere along the line.  Still, I bet the landscapes will be delightful. The bullet points, however, are less than informative: Experience Thrilling New Adventures Explore Untamed Frontiers Uncover Ancient Mysteries Obtain Collectibles with Our New Baubles Journey Farther with Expedition Supplies Exciting Bonus Items in the Ultimate Fan Bundle There have been some updates to that on the expansion page, linked at the end of the post. I am sure the whole thing will be an overland feast for the eyes, as that is the one thing the LOTRO team has excelled at over the years.  Taming lag, making the UI usable beyond HD resolutions, and having a launcher that updates your files in a reasonable time frame though… those are still on the “to do” list for some time in the next decade. There are, as usual, three tiers available for purchase with the expansion. Standard Edition – $40 Collector’s Edition – $80 Ultimate Fan Bundle – $130 As always, the more expensive the bundle the more cosmetic and consumable goodies you get. Every package also gets you a level 150 character boost.  But if the game needs you to be level 150 to get into the new stuff… the good stuff… then you have a serious new player progress issue that is difficult to solve with an over priced and half baked level boost available for an additional cost in the cash shop. So be wary.  My experience with LOTRO character boosts previously is that they get you to the right level then leave you under powered unless you go grind older content for an extended period of go buy boosts in the cash shop.  I hope they have done better this time. Otherwise, the game is down for now, but is slated to be ready to go at 13:00 Eastern US time, though with these sorts of launches it would not surprise me if the servers were not ready until well into the evening.
