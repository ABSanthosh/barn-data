  "text": "SummaryThe No Man’s Sky Cross-Save Update enables players to continue their journey across a wide range of supported devices.Link your accounts for different platforms on a dedicated website to access and launch your saves in-game.In celebration of Mass Effect’s annual N7 celebrations, we are bringing back the iconic and much-sought-after SSV Normandy SR1 as a limited-time expedition reward. Hello, This year has already been a very busy one for No Man’s Sky, with six updates already this year, including the huge Worlds Update. Our last one, The Cursed, dropped just a couple of weeks ago, and players have been loving the spooky Halloween vibe.  In game development some features take weeks or months, and others take years. Today we are releasing some features that have been years in the making. Cross-Save Support on All Platforms Starting from today we are rolling out Cross-Save support on all platforms including PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, and more. This has been a huge undertaking and is one of most requested features. Being able to jump seamlessly between platforms is transformative. Players can play from the comfort of their sofa on console, continue an Expedition on the move with Switch or Steam Deck, build an incredible base on their beefy PC rig, and view it in incredibly immersive Virtual Reality.  Adding the ability to transfer saves between platforms via a server is especially difficult for No Man’s Sky, as the work involved increases with each platform supported and how long folks have already been playing for. Both those numbers are large for our tiny team.  It’s very common for players to rack up thousands of hours of saves exploring across space, building elaborate bases and cataloguing their discoveries, with incredibly detailed saves. Adding Cross-Save for us is a little bit like moving house, the longer people have lived there the more complicated it is to move them! We also have players who played once at launch, eight years ago, suddenly loading up that save on a platform that didn’t even exist back then! For these reasons we have secretly been introducing the technology for this update for over six months. We are now ready to start rolling Cross-Save out to a small number of players. From today, all No Man’s Sky players can link their different accounts together at No Man’s Sky: Cross-Save website. A subset of players will be enabled to then select their saves from multiple devices on the in-game save screen. In the coming weeks all players will be invited to do so. The Normandy Returns Everyone here at Hello Games is a huge sci-fi nerd. One of our absolute favorite series is the incredible Mass Effect games. To join in Mass Effect’s annual N7 celebrations, we are pleased to welcome the legendary SSV Normandy SR1 back into No Man’s Sky!  It was in 2021 that the Normandy made its first appearance in one of the first expeditions we ever ran. The limited-time expedition culminated in players being able to claim the Normandy for their fleet. In the intervening years since that event, we have welcomed a huge number of Travellers, not least a whole new cohort of Switch players and an increasingly large number of Chinese fans. Many of these new players have envied those who proudly displayed their Normandy in their frigate collection. Mass Effect fans know that this legendary freighter only appears when it is most needed! Today, and for the next two weeks, as a love-letter from one science fiction game to another, we are giving everyone another chance to encounter the Normandy in an overhauled version of the original mission and add it to their collection. Huge thanks to our friends at EA and Bioware for helping make this happen. It has been a momentous year for No Man’s Sky in several ways. We’re so grateful to be able to continue this journey with you.",
