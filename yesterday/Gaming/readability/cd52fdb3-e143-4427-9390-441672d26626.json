For 4th of July (and as part of its greater Black Friday in July Sale), Dell has just dropped the price of its flagship Alienware Area-51 prebuilt gaming PC, equipped with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card starting at $4,449.99 with free shipping. This is an outstanding price for a prebuilt RTX 5090 gaming PC compared to the similar off-the-shelf prebuilts on Amazon, especially since the Alienware brand normally has a high markup. The RTX 5090 is undisputedly the most powerful graphics card on the market and is pretty much impossible to find for under $3,000 by itself.Alienware Area-51 RTX 5090 Gaming PC From $4,449.99Alienware Area-51 Intel Core Ultra 7 265K RTX 5090 Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)Alienware Area-51 Intel Core Ultra 9 285K RTX 5090 Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)This least expensive Alienware Area-51 RTX 5090 gaming PC configuration is equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 7 265K processor with 240mm liquid cooling, 32GB of DDR5-6400MHz RAM, and 2TB SSD storage. For an extra $250, you can upgrade to the Core Ultra 9 285K with 360mm liquid cooling. The Core Ultra 7 is already an excellent gaming CPU and you won't see any uplift in performance going with the Core Ultra 9. However, if you're a professional in need of the extra cores that the Core Ultra 9 offers (for example with AI generation), then the upgrade is worth it.The new Alienware Area-51 is a behemoth compared to the Alienware Aurora R16.The RTX 5090 Is the Most Powerful Graphics Card EverThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 has emerged as the most powerful consumer GPU on the market. Although Nvidia has prioritized software updates, AI features, and DLSS 4 technology to improve gameplay performance, the 5090 still boasts an impressive 25%-30% uplift over the RTX 4090 in terms of pure hardware-based raster performance. The 5090 also has more (32GB vs. 24GB) and faster (GDDR7 vs. GDDR6) VRAM compared to the 4090. This GPU is extremely difficult to find at retail price and is currently selling for $3,500-$4,000 on eBay.Check out more of the best Alienware dealsCheck out our Best Alienware Deals article with all of Dell's currently ongoing deals on gaming laptops and desktop PCs.
