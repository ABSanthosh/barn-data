  "text": "I have had an Audible.com account since May 14, 2000.  That feels like a lifetime ago.  My wife and I had been married less than a year at that point.  We still owned a condo, though we would soon go out and purchase our first single family detached home in the southwest suburbs of San Jose.   Our daughter would be born in 2001, so I have had that account longer than she has been around. Audible.com, owned by Amazon since 2008, also kind of a long time ago At the time I also had a job that was a 25 minute drive away… on a Sunday afternoon… or an hour or more during morning and afternoon traffic, something that meant a modification to my driving habits as I had, when I lived alone, tried to reside close to work.  I had already traded in my manual transmission Acura Integra for a first generation Acura 2.3 CL automatic, having grown tired of “rowing the boat” through constant stop and go traffic.  I had also grown tired of morning DJs and other radio fare and had been experimenting with books on CD.  I have, for example, a complete, unabridged compact disc set of The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion on my bookshelf from that era. That is a lot of disks.  But not only was that a bit expensive to keep buying such collections, they also take up a bit of space and managing disk swaps in the aforementioned stop and go traffic is not recommended. So eventually I started looking into digital formats and found Audible.  I looked at their device list, and picked up a Diamond Rio 500 and a FM transmitter adapter and subscribed to their two title a month plan, which was $11.95 a month at the time.  For that you could pick any two titles from their selection every month.  I was off to the races. There were problems at first.  The Diamond Rio 500 was a small capacity device, by today’s standards at least.  It was a choice between high compression and getting a whole book stuffed into its 64MB capacity (you could add a memory card but, as I recall, it behaved like a separate mount so you couldn’t push an 80MB book and expect it to split between the two storage spaces), or high quality but having to download longer titles into segments to listen to one at a time. There were also some issues with the software to manage books on your device… that was always an issue in the old days. Finally, there was the FM adapter.  My car only had a CD player/radio combo, with nothing like a “line in” port.  The FM adapter would broadcast input from the headphone jack of your device on the FM radio band.  You then just need to tune your car radio to that frequency and you hear your book through the car sound system.  This works great in theory and I have been places where it is almost an ideal solution, places with only a few radio stations on the FM dial. Silicon Valley… and the SF Bay Area… is not one of those places.  I occasionally surprise people from out of state when I mention that San Jose is the 10th largest city by population in the US, larger than either San Francisco or Oakland, which tend to be the places people associate with the region.  And there are a bunch of smaller cities and towns clustered around San Jose.  The place in LA in miniature, a suburban sprawl caused by post-war land grabs and annexations, limited mostly by the mountains and the bay.  It is, indeed, a valley. Anyway, a large population means a lot of radio stations.  The first FM transmitted I bought had 4 pre-set frequencies they had determined were lightly used.  Here, three of those had local station and the fourth was a Salinas station, which was just far enough away that the frequency was somewhat usable the further north I drove, but there was a line I would cross… around First Street in San Jose on Highway 101… where that would become unusable. I ended up with four different FM transmitters over a few months, trying to find a solution that would work.  What ended up solving the problem was my wife insisting I needed a 4-door vehicle to be able to haul our child around.  That meant trading in my CL for a less sporty sedan… and in that purchase I made sure I ended up with cassette deck, which was still an option back in the early years of the century.  While there was an interim vehicle, I ended up with a fifth generation Toyota Camry with a cassette deck, with which I used an old school cassette adapter for many years. Over the years things changed.  I got a Gen 3 iPod, which could hold multiple books, I moved to iTunes once it was available on Windows to manage content (this was when iTunes was a the best such software, unlike now…) and then on to newer iPods then an iPhone and eventually I found a BlueTooth adapter that would plug into the CD changer interface on the back of the radio in the Camry… which was good because the cassette player was starting to fail.  So now when I get in the car… that same beat up old Camry (because it still runs well and because we paid for our child to get through college)… my iPhone connects to the stereo automatically and the iPhone then pops up my current book or podcast on the login screen and I can just press “play” and off I go. Much improved from the early days. One thing that has not changed much over the years is Audible.  The plan I was on, which allowed me two book credits a month, has remained mine for nearly 25 years. At one point they raised the price to $13.95 a month, and on two occasions Audible then Amazon asked me to please choose another plan.  But the other plans were always a downgrade, so I kept on, figuring they would come for me some day.  And that day has finally come.  I got the following note from Amazon: We’re reaching out to let you know about an update to your membership plan. We we will no longer offer your current plan. It was too good to last.  On the down side, my option is to be moved to a plan that lets me select one title a month, though they won’t be hyperactive in expiring the credits after 30 days like they were with the old plan. It also includes access to titles in the “Originals” and “Audible Plus” catalog, which are things Amazon publishes directly, so they don’t have to pay somebody else.  But how extensive that is I am unsure.  I do know the Empires of EVE titles are on that list… but I already own those! Oh, and the new plan is $14.95 a month.  Getting less and paying more… but I knew I was getting a deal before, so I can’t really be mad about that. On the plus side, the are giving me 12 months of that plan for free before they start charging me.  That was not strictly necessary, so I appreciate the effort. All of which got me to look back at my library, which now has 687 titles in it.  That is more than 2 a month for 25 years.  I have taken them up on various offers to buy extra credits or sales and, on occasion, just straight up purchased the next title in a series when I had finished the previous title and simply couldn’t wait for my next set of credits. Going back to the early days, the first titles I grabbed included the combined works of Douglas Adams, unabridged, original texts (the first US editions substituted out some swear words), read by the author.  There were a lot of SF staples I had read before in the early purchases as I wasn’t too sure about retention with audio books.  Later, when I had things settled I used my monthly two credits to try new titles and explore new things. The other thing I noticed is that, despite Amazon’s assurance that anything I purchase or use credits to purchase will remain mine to access even if I decline to subscribe to the new offer, is that there are a chunk of titles that are, in fact, no longer available. They are still there in my library as placeholders, with a generic grey icon, but are no longer accessible.  Some I won’t miss.  For some reason I binged some Jack Higgins novels and those are all gone.  I also had some P.J. O’Rourke titles that have gone missing.  Those I probably won’t miss.  But there was also a college lecture series on the origins and history of science fiction as a literary genre by that was quite good… well, that is no longer there either. Such is the way of the ownership in the digital age, where you don’t actually own anything. I was interested in my old catalog in part because, now being limited to one credit a month, I might want to go back and re-run some past listens.  I have gone back for Douglas Adams a few times, and despite having The Lord of the Rings on physical CDs, I also grabbed them on Audible as that is a much more manageable format. Anyway, that was a lot of words for “Amazon changed my subscription.”   I do wonder how having only one selection a month will change my selection habits.  Two was enough for me to experiment on the unknown.  One might make me more conservative. Then again, I am also full time work from home, so I don’t really have a commute anymore.  I do have to drive to different state facilities now and then (maybe every other month), all of which are 1-4 hours away, so I do make up for a commute in that way I suppose.  We shall see.",
