  "text": "It was a big week in video games with the launch of the Switch 2. Fantasy Critic League – Like Fantasy Football, but for Video Games Did you go out and get a Switch 2 on Thursday when it launched? I will admit that even I was a bit tempted.  Fortunately. I suppose, there were none to be had nearby, so I was saved the decision.  But the Switch 2 is really the only video game console I might consider… and judging from my Switch Lite usage, even that commitment is pretty weak.  But I like a couple of the core Nintendo franchises and, aside from the odd phone app, those are in the walled garden of the Switch ecosystem. Pokemon and Pokemon accessories are on my list for sure, but so is Mario Kart.  First, however, let’s look at where we stood on scoring at the week opened up. The Standings for Week 21 Last week saw Cyanbane starting to dig himself out of his early counter-pick hole with the reasonably solid launch of F1 25, while Kluwes maintained their position in the pack on the back of Elden Ring Nightreign. Which brings us around to Mario Kart World, one of the launch titles for the updated console.  Mario Kart is always extremely popular and a top seller for any Nintendo console generation.  It also faces a reduced critic set being a one console title.  But it is also a long and storied franchise and it is hard for Nintendo to both keep the core theme AND innovate just enough to make it feel fresh and new.  So I could see the mainstream critics waving it away as solid but nothing new, my theory of the 80 score mean. So I was watching on Thursday to see what the first reviews might say about it… and then nothing showed up.  Nintendo had a very tight embargo on any reviews or pre-launch coverage, which meant sites were slow to get enough play time to be able to justify a review.  There were a lot of “so, where is out Mario Kart review?” articles out there. But, come later on Friday, reviews started to show up and the first score for the title landed on the league. Mario Kart World has released! [Picked by Play Forever Mwahahaha (Shintar)] Now has a score of 86.7 86.7 is a pretty good score for this league where the range of scores is currently between 73 and 92, and certainly better than bog standard long time major publisher franchise score of around 80. That was Shintar’s third release and it propelled her up the ranks as the scoring was calculated. Publisher Score Updates Play Forever Mwahahaha (Shintar) Score has gone UP from 25.8 to 42.5 Moved from 7th place to 3rd place Frabjous Day Enterprises (Archey) Moved from 3rd place to 4th place Slightly Scuffed Studios (Kluwes) Moved from 4th place to 5th place Crash and Burn Games (Shawn) Moved from 5th place to 6th place Neutical Publishing (Cyanbane) Moved from 6th place to 7th place So Shintar vaulted up to third place, which is very good for somebody with only three titles released so far. And that was the expected update for the week.  Nothing else was slated to launch.  Then, there was a Summer Games Week surprise launch announcement. Lies of P: Overture [Picked by Neutical Publishing (Cyanbane)] Release date changed from ‘Summer 2025’ to ‘Friday, June 06, 2025’. That popped on Friday, the 6th, and not too long after we got a score for that. Lies of P: Overture [Picked by Neutical Publishing (Cyanbane)] Now has a score of 82.5 That is a decent score.  I actually counter picked that title in the other league I am in and am paying the price for that now.  But Cyanbane getting his fourth title on the board caused another shake up of the rankings. Publisher Score Updates Neutical Publishing (Cyanbane) Score has gone UP from 37.0 to 49.5 Moved from 7th place to 3rd place Play Forever Mwahahaha (Shintar) Moved from 3rd place to 4th place Frabjous Day Enterprises (Archey) Moved from 4th place to 5th place Slightly Scuffed Studios (Kluwes) Moved from 5th place to 6th place Crash and Burn Games (Shawn) Moved from 6th place to 7th place That put Cyanbane up into third position with five titles launched, pushing Shintar and the rest of the mid-pack crew down another rung on the ladder. Then, as often happens, Mario Kart World began to settle down a bit as more reviews landed.  Not enough to warrant a score update from the bot, but enough to put Archey ahead of Shintar by a very small margin. Publisher Score Updates Frabjous Day Enterprises (Archey) Moved from 5th place to 4th place Play Forever Mwahahaha (Shintar) Moved from 4th place to 5th place And then at 17:00 yesterday, which is my cut off time for updates in these posts, there as one last position change. Publisher Score Updates Play Forever Mwahahaha (Shintar) Moved from 5th place to 4th place Frabjous Day Enterprises (Archey) Moved from 4th place to 5th place All of which left the scoreboard looking like this at the end of the week. The Standings for Week 22 Cyanbane is up there in third place, but has one more release than anybody else on the board, so that might not last.  Then there is the tight race for slots four through seven where even small score fluctuations change the lineup. In addition to all of that, there were also four release date updates. Wildgate [Picked by Play Forever Mwahahaha (Shintar)] Release date changed from ‘2025’ to ‘Thursday, July 24, 2025’. Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound [Picked by Neutical Publishing (Cyanbane)] Release date changed from ‘Summer 2025’ to ‘Thursday, July 31, 2025’. Dying Light: The Beast [Picked by TAGN HQ (Wilhelm)] Release date changed from ‘Summer 2025’ to ‘Friday, August 22, 2025’. Cairn [Picked by TAGN HQ (Wilhelm)] Release date changed from ‘2025’ to ‘Wednesday, November 05, 2025’. Shintar and  Cyanbane each have another release date locked down and I got two more dates for my picks.  All of that is good because we were starting to get to a point where everything after the first page of the upcoming releases was just some vague goal in 2025. There was also one bid this week. Shadow Labyrinth Won by Play Forever Mwahahaha (Shintar) with a bid of $10 So Shintar has an additional slot filled. Where does that leave us next week for releases? Coming up for week 23 We now have two titles on the list for week twenty-three, Dune: Awakening and The Alters. Dune: Awakening has been in pre-order head start mode since Thursday and has passed 100K peak concurrent players on Steam, but no reviews are available as of my writing this. Dune: Awakening is a bit of a wild card in my book, being a Funcom title.  They have a history of completely misunderstanding their audience initially, then having to fix/realign their game as time goes on. For example, our group played Conan: Exiles years after it launched and Funcom was putting out patches that had us boggled that they were only getting around to fixing some egregious stuff that long after launch. This time around Funcom initially said they were not going to have private servers at launch, which was odd because the private server aspect of Conan: Exiles seemed quite popular. Then they changed their minds and announced that there would be private servers available at launch… but they wouldn’t really be private servers because Funcom believes PvP is such a vital aspect of the game that your private server over at G-Portal was going to be linked to a world server for the PvP zones so randos could gank you with their krys knives. I was interested in the title from purely a private server point of view.  But since you can’t really have a true private server, I am much less enthused.  We shall see.  I would also bet money that Funcom changes that… in like four years.  But the game should be playable by then! Anyway, the user reviews for Dune: Awakening are good, but user reviews often swing wildly relative to game reviewers.  So we’ll see how that plays out. As for The Alters... I’ve got nothing.  It is an XBox/Windows title with a decent hype factor in the league with a score projection of about five points.

week twenty-three, \u003cem\u003eDune: Awakening\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eThe Alters\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDune: Awakening\u003c/em\u003e has been in pre-order head start mode since Thursday and has passed 100K peak concurrent players \u003ca href=\"https://steamdb.info/app/1172710/charts/\"\u003eon Steam\u003c/a\u003e, but no reviews are available as of my writing this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDune: Awakening\u003c/em\u003e is a bit of a wild card in my book, being a Funcom title.  They have a history of completely misunderstanding their audience initially, then having to fix/realign their game as time goes on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, our group played \u003cem\u003eConan: Exiles\u003c/em\u003e years after it launched and Funcom was putting out patches that had us boggled that they were only getting around to fixing some egregious stuff that long after launch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time around Funcom initially said they were not going to have private servers at launch, which was odd because the private server aspect of \u003cem\u003eConan: Exiles\u003c/em\u003e seemed quite popular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen they changed their minds and \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/546736546679621439\"\u003eannounced that there would be private servers available\u003c/a\u003e at launch… but they wouldn’t really be private servers because Funcom believes PvP is such a vital aspect of the game that your private server over at G-Portal was going to be linked to a world server for the PvP zones so randos could gank you with their krys knives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was interested in the title from purely a private server point of view.  But since you can’t really have a true private server, I am much less enthused.  We shall see.  I would also bet money that Funcom changes that… in like four years.  But the game should be playable by then!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, the user reviews for \u003cem\u003eDune: Awakening\u003c/em\u003e are good, but user reviews often swing wildly relative to game reviewers.  So we’ll see how that plays out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for \u003cem\u003eThe Alters.\u003c/em\u003e.. I’ve got nothing.  It is an XBox/Windows title with a decent hype factor in the league with a score projection of about five points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelated:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fantasycritic.games/league/64f8993f-aa76-4ab5-944c-6f128ec0ba63/2025\"\u003eTAGN Fantasy Critic League\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/VNPavN5r\"\u003eTAGN Discord Server\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fantasycritic.games/\"\u003eFantasy Critic Site\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fantasycritic.games/howtoplay\"\u003eFantasy Critic How to Play\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fantasycritic.games/faq\"\u003eFantasy Critic FAQ\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://opencritic.com/\"\u003eOpen Critic Review Site\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
