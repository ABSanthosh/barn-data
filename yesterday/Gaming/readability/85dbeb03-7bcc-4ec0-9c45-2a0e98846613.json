The Steam Summer Sale 2025 This year, as with most recent sales, I ended up not buying anything. Insert the usual boilerplate about too many unplayed games in my backlog and nothing really appealing to me to the level that it would take me away from whatever I am currently playing.  Steam sale ennui. Though, even as I was contemplating my purchases, or lack thereof, and debating maybe one possible title (Blue Prince, which I read a bit about and seemed like it might be interesting), I was amused by an article over at WCCFTech where an analyst announced that Steam users buy games they don’t end up playing! Sky also noted to be blue I know, that seems like an almost blindingly obvious statement to anybody who has been around for even a few Steam seasonal sales, but the tone of the article is envious as to Valve’s hold over its user base. Valve successfully cultivated a user base of hoarders who buy games they don’t actually play So they have cracked the player spending code in a way that competitors are no doubt envious of.  XBox game pass is said to be profitable, though it eats into first party sales, while the Epic Game Story needs to engage in bribery by giving games away for free to get people to sign up. The story that the latter strategy had its foundation in Tim Sweeney’s youth, where he was so unlikable that his parents had to put a pork chop on a string around his neck to get the family dog to play with him, appears to be completely unfounded.  Stop repeating that story. The key take away here is that if you can create a business model where your customers buy your stuff then never… well… open the box would be the metaphor here I guess… then you’re golden.  Or something.  I mean, look at my Steam calculator profile: My Steam Value as the sale was winding down I have played just 143 of the 221 games I have purchased.  And nearly 20 of those 143 I played for 20 minutes or less.  Most of my time on the service is wrapped up in four titles that total up to about 1,650 hours played. My Steam top Four After those four (Valheim, Civilization V, Rimworld, and Enshrouded) the next 20 titles on the list add up to about half that much and then you’re getting into the realm of titles I have spent around 10 hours with and it drops off from there. My point is… um… people still buy games on Steam I guess.  And they don’t always play them.  And that there is always another sale on its way.  So you might as well spend less if you’re going to buy stuff you won’t bother playing.  Or something like that.  I fell when getting out of bed this morning, which wasn’t a great start to the day. In conclusion, I didn’t but anything, not even from the heavily discounted 95% off selection, but I bet some of you did.  And I will likely buy something soon because Rimworld has a new DLC coming out later this month that will let you take your colony into space.  And I might even play it.  We shall see.",
