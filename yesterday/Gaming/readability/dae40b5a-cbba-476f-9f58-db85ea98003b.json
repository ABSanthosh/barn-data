  "text": "SummaryA true survival horror experience.Immersive terrifying world to explore.Investigate what really happened and how to survive Exclusively brought to you by Xbox Wire, Blood Hunting arrives to Xbox for Pre-Order on January 31, 2025.  Enjoy this first-person horror survival experience while finding clues to solve puzzles that help explain the true story behind the mystery. One key goal for the game is to stay immersed as much as possible, not to search for items in the inventory or check the phone for text messages.  As you play Blood Hunting you will receive text messages for hints along the way from a stranger that is trying to help you.  Also, as you approach puzzles, any items you gather will automatically be used if you are carrying the item. You begin the game reading newspaper articles of unexplainable deaths and awake in your bed from the sound of your phone vibrating on the nightstand.  The text message is from an unknown number, but the message is clear that someone is coming, and you must leave before they find you. You will explore various places starting at your hotel.  First you must find a way out, the more you explore the more dead people you find in the building and begin to believe the text was true.  There is no way to fight and the only way to survive is to hide and not make a sound.  You will travel down dark hallways, abandoned buildings, caves, forests and numerous other areas.  Be aware of your surroundings at all times, as it can be the difference between life and death.  There will be hidden places to hide just when you need them when someone or something is close to you.  Ensure that you examine every clue and pickup every item that you can find.  These clues throughout the game will help you to progress further to the next level.  As you solve puzzles and find new clues you will begin to understand what happened to those people and why they died the way they did.  And as you slowly solve the mystery of what is happening you also begin to understand what you now must do.  Not only is this personal to what happened to your family, it is also a danger to all humanity.  The knowledge you obtain and the tools you find along the way will help you succeed.  One thing to remember, a choice must be made and there is no time to waste.  They are hunting you and you must survive long enough to discover the truth.  Do you have what it takes to survive?  Pre-order your copy of Blood Hunting to start playing early.  Let the blood hunting begin! Holcomb Entertainment LLC $24.99 You are Chase Jones, who lost his family when he was young. You will need to put the pieces together to understand what happened to them. As you uncover the truth you become aware of what you must do. Unfortunately, those responsible have begun to hunt you so they can put an end to this investigation. An unknown stranger helps by sending text messages to your phone. You have to survive long enough to discover the truth and try to do something about it. Keep your phone close and remember you cannot fight them. You will only survive if you hide and find them before they find you.
