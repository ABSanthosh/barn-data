The Xbox trailer for the title is missing some female ninjas from the Steam and PlayStation 5 trailers. For comparison, take a look at the Xbox trailer, which is the same one that was shown during the Direct: Now, look at the PlayStation 5 video, which is the same as the Steam one: Confusingly, the Xbox trailer is shorter and has different footage than the other clips. As one X user pointed out, differences start at the 0:35 mark. Other users also chimed in, clearly showing that the Xbox trailer replaced the three female ninjas in the Steam/PlayStation 5 video with masculine monsters. Related: Celeste Devs Cancel Their Metroidvania Game, Earthblade, Due to Team Fractures \u0026 Development Issues I’m on the side that says that this is an odd choice and not that Xbox hates women. If I were to guess, I would say Xbox wanted a less risque version of the Ninja Gaiden 2 Black reveal for the Direct itself and then just uploaded that same footage to its YouTube account. Of course, the Direct featured a lot of blood and gore, which Microsoft was fine with, but “violence ok, semi-nudity bad” is part of the American Dream, after all. It’s all perfectly fine, though. These female ninjas are still in the actual game, as they appear in the non-Xbox trailers, so all the gamers complaining online about censorship are just doing it for attention. Players can purchase Ninja Gaiden 2 Black on whatever platform they desire and see whatever characters they want. Besides, I heard the real thing to be upset about is how this fancy remaster is closer to Ninja Gaiden 2 Sigma than the tough-as-nails original. The Escapist is supported by our audience.
