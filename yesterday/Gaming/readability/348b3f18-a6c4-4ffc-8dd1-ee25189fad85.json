To get this price you will need to follow two simple steps:You'll need to sign into your Walmart account to see this deal (signing up is free)Add the 65\" LG Evo C4 4K OLED TV to your cartClip the $224.55 coupon in your shopping cart to bring it down to $1,272.44The LG Evo C4 OLED TV has won top spots in several of our buying guides, including best 4K TV, best TV for gaming, and best TV for the PlayStation 5. This is an especially good choice if you picked up the new PS5 Pro, since the updated hardware will be able to run more games at a consistent 4K @ 120fps.65\" LG Evo C4 4K OLED Smart TV: The Best PS5 TVMust be signed in and clip the coupon65\" LG Evo C4 4K Smart TVThe C4 is the current generation 2024 model among LG's highly vaunted C-series OLED TV lineup. Compared to traditional LED LCD TVs, OLED TVs offer superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times. The C4 uses LG's Evo panel, which boasts higher brightness levels than traditional OLED TVs. Because of these advantages, the OLED TV excels at displaying 4K HDR content in all of its intended glory. We prefer LG over other brands of OLED TVs primarily because they've been out for a longer period of time. Every year model is an incremental update over previous years, but it all adds up when you have several generations under your belt. We gave the older LG C2 a near-perfect score when we first reviewed it, for example.The C4 also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV. It has four HDMI 2.1 ports all capable of up to 144Hz refresh rate at 4K resolution. That's great news for PS5 (and now PS5 Pro), Xbox Series X, and PC gamers, since several games can be played at frame rates of 120fps and beyond. The C4 also supports variable refresh rate (VRR) including Nvidia G-Sync and auto low latency mode (ALLM). When connected to a PC, it supports chroma 4:4:4 for better text legibility.A particularly nice feature that isn't advertised often is the surprisingly light weight of the C4. The 65\" TV weighs in at only 36.6 pounds without the stand. That's because the rear cabinet housing is made of a composite fiber that's lighter than the plastics most TVs use. It might not matter much in the long term, but this is a welcome advantage when you are first setting up your TV, especially if you plan on wall mounting.65\" LG Evo C3 4K OLED Smart TV: Also the Best PS5 TV65\" LG Evo C3 4K Smart TVAlternatively, you can pick up a 2023 model 65\" LG Evo C3 4K OLED Smart TV from Amazon for only $1,196.99. The LG Evo C3 is a 2023 model, just one year behind the 2024 LG Evo C4. So what are the differences? Aside from the $650 price difference, not much. The most important trait -- picture quality -- is more or less identical. Where the C4 improves on the C3 are an upgraded processor, newer WebOS smart interface, and a higher 144Hz refresh rate.More Cyber Monday TV DealsCyber Monday, and the big retailers (Target, Best Buy, Amazon, Walmart) have released excellent deals on several TVs. Whether you're on a budget and want the biggest TV you can get for the least amount of money, or you're at the other end of the spectrum and you're willing to pay more for the best image quality and features (while still getting a good price, of course), there's a deal here for everyone. I'll keep this article updated through Cyber Monday.Will the Deals Change for Cyber Monday?In my experience, many of the same deals we saw on Black Friday will return for Cyber Monday 2024, including deals that were sold out or expired. Retailers usually release their hottest selling items in batches so that every sale event has at least some inventory reserved. That said, I also expect plenty of new, never before seen deals. Traditionally, Black Friday was known as the \"retail holiday,\" where the best deals were found in-store, and Cyber Monday was known as the \"online holiday,\" where the best deals were online only. Although today the lines have blurred, it is still true that many online only retailers still consider Cyber Monday the sale event of the year instead of Black Friday. Expect some amazing sales to come out of online-only sites like Amazon, Newegg, Dell, HP, Lenovo and several online-only deals from traditional retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. In fact, Amazon has taken the preemptive and already switched over to Cyber Monday.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
