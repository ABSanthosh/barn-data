  "text": "Image credit: BioWare Surprise! Dragon Age: The Veilguard has just gained a few more weapons on PC, thanks to the arrival of the Rook's Weapons Appearance Bundle. This unexpected Steam freebie is available for PC players at no extra cost, and has popped up now while the game is currently on offer at a steep discount to £25, reduced by 50 percent from its base price of £50. The release of these new weapons comes despite the fact that BioWare has not only been downsized, but had previously signalled the end of its support for Dragon Age: The Veilguard after publisher EA described it as having underperformed. Over on reddit, where the Rook's Weapons Appearance Bundle was first discovered (thanks, TheGamer), fans have speculated that these weapons were already included within the game's files for use in a future promotion - meaning no new work to make them has actually gone on. Bioware released a weapons set DLC today byu/Whole-Arachnid-Army indragonage Eurogamer has contacted EA for more detail on the Rook's Weapons Appearance Bundle - and asked whether these items will also eventually become unlocked for those who own the game on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Alongside Dragon Age: The Veilguard's current deep sale on Steam, the game also popped up last month as part of Sony's PlayStation Plus subscription. EA recently raised eyebrows by suggesting that the game might have sold better if it had kept its live-service elements - something previous Dragon Age developers have scoffed at.",
