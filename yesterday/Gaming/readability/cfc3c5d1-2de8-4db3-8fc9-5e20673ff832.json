  "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. How would you rather spend some unexpected afternoon free time: watching a movie, going for a walk or reading a book? I’d love some extra time to read! I recently found a new-to-me author that I enjoy, Rebecca Searle, and I’m going through all of her books. 2. What did you last cry about? Well, I went to the OBGYN last week, and I had a mini-meltdown when the nice nurse took my blood pressure. I think it’s a little bit of leftover post-traumatic stress from going to the doctor so much last year along with some hormonal stuff (dang this peri-menopause). 3. What would you rather do with a friend: play card games, have a picnic in the park or go to the farmers’ market?

What would you rather do with a friend: play card games, have a picnic in the park or go to the farmers’ market? Let’s go to the farmers’ market and sample all the delicious spring fruit and then bring home $20 strawberries and a sourdough baguette! 4. Pick a free hair service (done by a stylist you love, of course): haircut, highlights, a smoothing treatment or extensions? I haven’t had a haircut since August (!), so a cut would be great. 5. Something memorable that happened in March? Last month was a busy one for our family with lots of memories made! My favorite one, though, was seeing Connor compete in an individual improv dance competition (her first performance without her team) and watching her move onto the final round. She didn’t take home one of the top three prizes, so she was a little disappointed, but she did receive a scholarship, which was great. Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S.
