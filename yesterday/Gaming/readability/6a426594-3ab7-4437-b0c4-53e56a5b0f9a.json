  "text": "SummarySNK showcases the new Two-Lane Battle system in the latest entry of their legendary fighting game series, Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, available now for Xbox Series X|S.Players will be able to freely move between foreground and background lanes during battle and even perform combos across both lanes!This marks the first time in 27 years that Two-Lane Battles are back, allowing players to relive the glory days of the arcade! Hello everyone! Today I want to introduce you to the new Two-Lane Battle system we’ve included in Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, the first Fatal Fury game in 26 years launching April 24 for Xbox Series X|S. Battle On Two Lanes The highly anticipated Two-Land Battle system will feature two lanes on certain stages: a foreground lane and a background lane. By inputting a specific attack, you’ll be able to freely switch between the lanes and move around the battlefield. Since the available actions also depend on what lane you and your opponent are in, this battle system adds a whole new set of mind games and tricks you can use both offensively and defensively to secure victory! How It Works First, select the Dream Amusement Park “Morning” stage to get access to this nostalgic battle system; at launch this will be the only stage to have Two-Lane Battles enabled, but we plan on adding more of these stages in the near future. You and your opponent will start the battle in the same lane, but you can lane switch by pressing X and RB at the same time. If you want to attack while switching lanes, press A and RB at the same time to perform a special jumping lane switch attack. Once you and your opponent are in different lanes, you’ll gain access to a variety of special attacks. If you want to stay on the ground, pressing X will perform a grounded lane switch attack that will place you in the same lane as your opponent. If you’re looking to attack from the air, pressing A or B will perform a jumping lane switch attack. Pressing Y will perform a special lane pullback attack that will bring your opponent to the same lane you are currently in. You’ll also be able to use jumping lane switch attacks in the middle of combos to perform cross-lane combos! Here’s a sample combo with Rock: X → Y → A + RB → B → Heavy Rising Tackle (Brake) → Heavy Hard Edge Try using lane switch attacks in your combos to take your game to a whole new level! The Old in the New Two-Lane Battles have been a part of Fatal Fury’s identity since the very first game in 1991 and we’re so excited to be able to bring them back for City of the Wolves. We’ve integrated Two-Lane Battles into training mode as well, so we hope players get creative and find new ways to utilize the system. Classic fans can relive what makes Fatal Fury different from other fighting game series, and we’re looking forward to seeing brand new fans enjoy the chaos of Two-Lane Battles as well! We are so excited to be able to deliver the next game in this legendary series! Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves is available now for Xbox Series X|S. To keep up to date on all things Fatal Fury, follow us at our official X account or join our official community Discord server. Let’s rev it up! FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves – Special Edition * FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves will only be available in this Special Edition format. * There are no plans at this time to sell the base game and Season Pass 1 individually. Contents: – Base game – Season Pass 1 – DLC Character 1 \"ANDY BOGARD\"(Scheduled for: Summer 2025) – DLC Character 2 \"KEN\" (Scheduled for: Summer 2025) – DLC Character 3 \"JOE HIGASHI\"(Scheduled for: Fall 2025) – DLC Character 4 \"CHUN-LI\" (Scheduled for: Winter 2025) – DLC Character 5 \"Mr. BIG\"(Scheduled for: Early 2026) SNK’s beloved Fatal Fury series first hit the market in 1991, spearheading the fighting game boom of the 1990s that swept the industry thereafter. GAROU: MARK OF THE WOLVES (released in 1999) has, for some time, served as the franchise’s most recent installment. But that is all about to change: 26 years on, a brand-new entry—FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves—is set to arrive on the scene! ■All-new REV System supercharges the excitement! Introducing the REV System, a brand-new toolset that offers unique offensive options from the moment the battle begins! Use REV Arts, REV Accel, REV Blows (while S.P.G. is active), and more until you hit your limit and the REV Meter overheats. The all-new REV System—fight at full throttle and supercharge the excitement! ■Two control schemes—fun for newcomers and veterans alike! Choose from two control schemes: Arcade Style is based on precise, technical inputs, while Smart Style lets you perform flashy special moves and combos using directional inputs and single button presses. From fighting game newcomers to seasoned veterans, there’s plenty of fun and excitement to be had—tailored specifically to your level! ■Memorable fighters from far and wide descend on the streets of South Town! The action kicks off with a total of 22 characters: a diverse 17-member roster of familiar faces and new blood, plus five DLC fighters in Season Pass 1. Every character is vibrantly presented in CotW's unique art style, which is guaranteed to stimulate the senses. ■Strive for supremacy in EPISODES OF SOUTH TOWN, a single-player RPG mode! Introducing “Episodes of South Town” (EOST)—a solo RPG adventure where you’ll square up against contenders under various fight conditions, earning XP and other rewards for your efforts. Level up your fighter, build out a diverse kit of skills, and dominate the opposition on your way to the top. Dreams and ambitions run rampant in South Town; now is the time to chase the city’s crown and carve a legend all of your own! * To play EOST you’ll first need to connect to the Internet and update the game.",

GAROU: MARK OF THE WOLVES (released in 1999) has, for some time, served as the franchise’s most recent installment. But that is all about to change: 26 years on, a brand-new entry—FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves—is set to arrive on the scene!\n\n■All-new REV System supercharges the excitement!\nIntroducing the REV System, a brand-new toolset that offers unique offensive options from the moment the battle begins! Use REV Arts, REV Accel, REV Blows (while S.P.G. is active), and more until you hit your limit and the REV Meter overheats. The all-new REV System—fight at full throttle and supercharge the excitement!\n\n■Two control schemes—fun for newcomers and veterans alike!\nChoose from two control schemes: Arcade Style is based on precise, technical inputs, while Smart Style lets you perform flashy special moves and combos using directional inputs and single button presses. From fighting game newcomers to seasoned veterans, there’s plenty of fun and excitement to be had—tailored specifically to your level!\n\n■Memorable fighters from far and wide descend on the streets of South Town!\nThe action kicks off with a total of 22 characters: a diverse 17-member roster of familiar faces and new blood, plus five DLC fighters in Season Pass 1. Every character is vibrantly presented in CotW\u0026#39;s unique art style, which is guaranteed to stimulate the senses.\n\n■Strive for supremacy in EPISODES OF SOUTH TOWN, a single-player RPG mode!\nIntroducing “Episodes of South Town” (EOST)—a solo RPG adventure where you’ll square up against contenders under various fight conditions, earning XP and other rewards for your efforts. Level up your fighter, build out a diverse kit of skills, and dominate the opposition on your way to the top. Dreams and ambitions run rampant in South Town; now is the time to chase the city’s crown and carve a legend all of your own!\n* To play EOST you’ll first need to connect to the Internet and update the game.\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003chr/\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
