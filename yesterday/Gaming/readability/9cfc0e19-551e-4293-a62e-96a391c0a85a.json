  "text": "Image credit: Evil Empire The Rogue Prince of Persia's enormous new update, Second Act, is here. We already knew it would function as something of a full relaunch but today Ubisoft made it official, calling it The Rogue Prince of Persia's \"biggest update since launching in early access on Steam and GeForce back in May 2024\". Along with upgraded art work and a changed colour palette, players can expect the wartime city of Ctesiphon to come to life, along with a \"significant transformation regarding the Prince, whose colour has been changed from purple to a tone that not only better fits the new direction, but also its genre, setting, and the Prince of Persia series in general\".

I just love to watch him run.\"",
