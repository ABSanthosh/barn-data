More of a threat than a promise in my eyes To start with, this was somewhat out of character for WP.com, whose usual method is to made some change that breaks a bunch of things and not announce it at all.  They like to push stuff out and see who complains. (Hint: me, the long time paying customer, a status which shaves off maybe two degrees of disdain from the support teams attitude of “the customer is always wrong.”  They are absolute masters of not understanding the question, ignoring what you actually said, and repeating some canned response that was addressed in your initial question.  Getting WP.com to understand and acknowledge your question is just the first hurdle, and the end result is always just to chant “the new feature is better old man” until I go away.) Anyway, I went to the Posts page and saw immediately that they had removed the ability to create a new post using the classic editor or to edit a current post/draft using the classic editor.  That was gone.  The awful block editor was the only option. Here is the point where somebody inevitably says the block editor is good or fine… and if you believe that you are objectively wrong.  I will cite, as evidence, every successful word processor ever, none of which decided every paragraph of text should exist in an independent block.  Blocks are a page layout tool, not a writing tool, and making your text editor a page layout tool emphasizes the point that you care about style over the actual ability to enter text. (Also, as page layout tool, the block editor isn’t a very good one, so the upside of that is missing.  I might be more accepting if it was a decent page layout tool.  It is not.) Somebody else will likely mention the Classic block, which is an attempt to put a subset of classic options in a single block type.  And that… sort of works.  As noted, it is a subset of options, missing several key items I have grown used to in the classic editor, like the ability to select some text and paste a URL to turn that text into a link.  That is absolutely broken in the classic block and it actually deletes the entire contents of the block when you do it. (Control-z! Control-z! Control-z! as I panic after doing it for the fourth time in the same post.)  Beyond that though, it also has to exist within the block editor UI, which it might not surprise you to learn I find less than ideal.  I am not a fan of the big white page with no boarders look and a tendency to jump around awkwardly (a general block editor problem) and being less WYSIWYG than the actual classic editor… and, of course, the damn tool keeps prodding you to convert your post to blocks. The Classic Block with Constant Nag Above Still, my biggest worry was never being able to edit any old post again without wrecking its formatting.  The one truism so far is that the block editor and the classic editor do not mix. Going from one to the other breaks formatting and image captions and generally requires a bunch of tedious work to clean things up.  I know this from practical experience. So I do have to give WP.com a nod for at least anticipating that problem, which is more than I expected, in that they managed to successfully convert old posts into classic blocks so they are not completely broken if you edit them.  I think.  I am still a bit afraid to try. I also haven’t had to commit too hard, as it turns out… the Classic Editor is still there, it is just hidden and if you are patient you can find it. Just going back and forth in and out of the Posts page reveals it to me. Oh look, there it is still [Also, there is a preview of a post I wrote that is scheduled for August 2026.] I assume this was their roll-back strategy, just to turn it back on… again, given past history the idea that they would have a roll-back strategy did not seem to me to be a given… if the who thing went sideways. But I also assume that this is a temporary situation, that at some point they will actually remove the classic editor for good, so I am trying to use the classic block… and it still kind of sucks.  I will likely do more writing up front in Notepad++, which won’t be a huge change.  That is sort of my pre-drafts folder. So I am not at all happy that, after more than 18 years, WP.com has finally pulled the rug from under me when it comes to editing.  After all that, I am ready to turn around and give WP.com credit for something.  WP.com has discovered the Fediverse, the distribute network of domains using the ActivityPub protocol that is often mistaken for being Mastodon, though that is just part of it.  Other services, such as PixelFed, PeerTube, Blue Sky, and Threads can and do hook up to it… though I think, as a rule, every other service blocks Threads because it is a spammy shit sandwich of a service by default, and has only gotten worse since Zuck’s masculinity crisis. For many of us not into it, the Fediverse has mostly been a word that its most ardent supporters throw at us like religious zealots, demanding we understand while rarely deigning to explain what in the hell they are talking about or why we should care. (Hint: After years of blockchain scams shouting the word “distributed”, it doesn’t have the impact you might think it should.)  For me it has mostly been a feature that lets me see people on other Mastodon servers from the one I chose. But now I can add to that the fact that you can subscribe to this blog through the Fediverse.  That is two Fediverse things I know, now that I have gone down into the marketing and connection settings and turned on the connection for the blog. WordPress.com and the Fediverse You can, with any ActivityPub connected app, now subscribe directly to the feed from my blog by following:  tagn.wordpress.com@tagn.wordpress.com Yes, that is basically the blog URL at the blog URL.  But it seems to work.  After I set it up I went over to Mastodon, searched on it, and was able to find and follow it.  Also, if you reply to something from that feed it shows up back here on the blog as a comment.  Given how BAD the WP.com comment UI is right now, that alone is worth the price of entry. (See, I can find a way to slam WP even as I compliment them!) Unfortunately, you can’t follow BOTH of my blogs from that single identifier.  For EVE Online Pictures you have to find and follow evepics.wordpress.com@evepics.wordpress.com, but they both appear to be visible in Mastodon.  I am not sure if you can find them on any other service.  I am not sure how Blue Sky really touches the Fediverse, and I don’t use any of the other options I know of. I am also not entirely happy about how the interface presents my posts, but you cannot have everything I suppose.  Still, this was a new feature from WP.com that seemed like a net positive.  It doesn’t make up for them killing the classic editor, but I’ll take it.",
