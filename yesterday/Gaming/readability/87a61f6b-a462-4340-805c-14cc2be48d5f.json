  "text": "Have you ever had the chance to surprise someone you truly admire?  I recently got that chance – to surprise Nicolas Doucet with congratulations (and a cake!) celebrating his and Team Asobi’s well deserved Game of the Year win at The Game Awards for Astro Bot! It was such a fun moment… Neither of us are experienced talk-show hosts and I got to bust in on him when he was nervously recording his own intro for this entry in Sony’s Creator to Creator series. But while that was a super fun bit, it also kind of broke the ice – and gave us the chance to really just enjoy talking to one another about our personal experiences making games…. About the principles we use to try to shape the design and tone of our work.  While our teams at Team Asobi and Sucker Punch Productions make games that appear on the surface to be very different – we discovered how many shared values we have, and how much our teams have in common. Nico shares lots of insightful thoughts about how Team Asobi crafts their games, how they think about the blend novelty with difficulty, and even how they designed some of our Sucker Punch characters into their games. Then he turned the tables on me and we got to talk about how nervous we both were making our first games for Sony, some of the lessons learned when developing Ghost of Tsushima, and which moments from the game stood out the most. I left our conversation feeling super inspired, and appreciative to have the chance to have spent this time talking to Nico and learning from him.  I hope you enjoy this Creator to Creator half as much as I did surprising and chatting with Nico! Enjoy!  Trending Stories",
