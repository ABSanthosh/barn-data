Civilization VII arrives today… for some Technically, Civ VII does not launch until next week, the ship date being February 11, 2025.  However, if you were willing to pay for the either the deluxe or founder’s editions of the game, you get to start playing on February 5th… which is today! Civ VII packages, $70 to $130… image taken February 2nd In the world of Steam this is called “Advance Access,” and is described as follows: Advanced Access is a feature that allows users that have pre-purchased a game to play prior to the game’s official release. For example, a “deluxe” pre-purchase version may include Advanced Access. Unlike Early Access, Advanced Access is not a unique model of development for a game, it’s simply an opportunity to play a game before it fully releases on Steam. Now, the immediate question is probably whether or not being able to play a few days in advance is worth a $30-$60 uplift in price. (And that is not bringing into account the physical collector’s edition for $280, which includes a clock so you can chart the hours spent with the game I suppose.) Civilization VII physical edition… did you think I was kidding about the clock? And, yes, there is more to each of the editions than just the advanced access, but it is hard to tell what matters on day one and what is just fluff.  Traditionally, anything in those editions ends up being handed out or sold for cheap later on.   Then again, the game itself will be sold at a discount a year from now. At least I think it will.  As with so many high profile titles, gone are the days when they would sell you the game and go away until an expansion was available.  No, there is a whole content roadmap for 2025! The Civilization content roadmap for 2025 The Crossroads of the World… which sounds very much like a season pass… will be doling out new civilizations and new leaders and wonders over the course of March and that come April they will have a new season pass to purchase that will continue the drip of what would have once been content of the base game at launch throughout the rest of the year. None of which makes me eager to jump in early… or even next week. And I will stipulate that I am aware of the problems the video game industry faces.  Here is a chart from a recent report on the state of the video game industry in 2025 about the price of video games as measured in 2024 dollars. Price of video games over 45 years in 2024 dollars So back around 1980 when Richard Garriott and Robert Woodhead and Silas Warner were selling titles for $30 they were probably grossing what would now translated into well over the $130 collector’s edition price for Civ VII.  Meanwhile, their development costs were mostly what one might call “sweat equity” in that it was their labor and the labor of a few other individuals that made the games possible. I listened to the author of that report speak about the state of the industry (you can go find the full report from which I grabbed that one slide on his web site and heard him speak on this podcast) and, while he does occasionally pass over the whole cost of good sold aspect of the physical box generations of video games to grouse about Apple and Google taking 30% off of the top of transactions in their stores (if you think publishers were sacrificing less than that to create a physical box with a disk, shipped it to a distributor who in turn sold it to a retail chain like, I’m going to have to burst that bubble) it is still a very real problem in the industry. [Also, the most amusing chart in that presentation is the one about how completely wrong nearly every prediction around VR adoption has been.] Sure, it is in many ways self-inflicted because everybody thinks success for a year or five years or a decade… and video games did very well between 2010 and 2020… translates into a line forever going up and studio heads borrowed and staffed up based on those projections while even a doofus like myself was pondering a post-Covid crash… and, well, we’ve seen the results since.  Layoffs, studio closures, titles being cancelled, and even titles being launched and shut down almost immediately because it was clear they were never going to make their projections. All of which is a round-about way of saying that I know in the analytical part of my brain that I should probably be paying $130 or more for a new video game like Civilization VII. But that analytical portion of my brain gets overruled by the my wider view of tech where hardware has gotten so much better over the years such that the price for whatever performance metric you choose has fallen regularly in a way that software capabilities have not kept up. Or, to put it another way, there is no chance I want to go back to the computer I was using when any particular past version of Civilization launched… even the machine I had in 2016 when Civilization VI launched is now two upgrades ago… but I am not convinced that Civilization VII will offer me an experience that will surpass any of those past titles in the series.  And, thanks to Steam and a bit of work on my own, I can go back today and play Civ II through Civ VI on demand.  It is unclear to me what is Civ VII bringing to the table that will improve upon past titles besides improved graphical fidelity, and overwrought graphics have always impaired the actual game play of the franchise in my opinion.  I end up turning most of that down or off pretty quickly as it becomes noise in the way of the actual game. Which is, of course, part of the problem the video games industry is in.  Old games exist and we still play them.  Again, that report I linked above notes that titles the mastered the revenue growth engines of the last decade are still active and holding audiences meaning that any new game needs some net new players to match something like Fortnite or Roblox… and that just isn’t happening.  Even me still playing some old Civ title rather than the fresh new version is hindering success. And that is all before I see Firaxis and their content plan that looks like it will be trying to make up the development costs by selling civilizations and leaders piecemeal before we even get to the inevitable first expansion.  When I’m looking at a classic 4x strategy title rolling itself like a live service experience with what will no doubt be something akin to a subscription… well, it had better be damn good… like a Civ blow and hookers experience to get past my initial skepticism. We’ll see.  The world is turning me into a hardened cynic so everything starts to look like scam or cash grab or some sort of intentional deception. Anyway, I will be keeping an eye on reviews and evaluations of the game and I will, at some future point likely own a copy via Steam.  But not today.  I’ll let you rush ahead and blaze that trail.  I might get out an older version of the game to see if that gets me more in the mood.",

week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I will stipulate that I am aware of the problems the video game industry faces.  Here is a chart from a recent report on the state of the video game industry in 2025 about the price of video games as measured in 2024 dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_132166\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

id=\"caption-attachment-132166\"\u003ePrice of video games over 45 years in 2024 dollars\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo back around 1980 when Richard Garriott and Robert Woodhead and Silas Warner were selling titles for $30 they were probably grossing what would now translated into well over the $130 collector’s edition price for \u003cem\u003eCiv VII\u003c/em\u003e.  Meanwhile, their development costs were mostly what one might call “sweat equity” in that it was their labor and the labor of a few other individuals that made the games possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI listened to the author of that report speak about the state of the industry (you can go find the full report from which I grabbed that one slide \u003ca href=\"https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025\"\u003eon his web site\u003c/a\u003e and heard him speak \u003ca href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-is-gaming-underperforming-expectations/id1526477480?i=1000685435588\"\u003eon this podcast\u003c/a\u003e) and, while he does occasionally pass over the whole cost of good sold aspect of the physical box generations of video games to grouse about Apple and Google taking 30% off of the top of transactions in their stores (if you think publishers were sacrificing less than that to create a physical box with a disk, shipped it to a distributor who in turn sold it to a retail chain like, I’m going to have to burst that bubble) it is still a very real problem in the industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Also, the most amusing chart in that presentation is the one about how completely wrong nearly every prediction around VR adoption has been.]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, it is in many ways self-inflicted because everybody thinks success for a year or five years or a decade… and video games did very well between 2010 and 2020… translates into a line forever going up and studio heads borrowed and staffed up based on those projections while even a doofus like myself was \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2021/01/01/2021-and-questions-for-a-new-year/\"\u003epondering a post-Covid crash\u003c/a\u003e… and, well, we’ve seen the results since.  Layoffs, studio closures, titles being cancelled, and even titles being launched and shut down almost immediately because it was clear they were never going to make their projections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of which is a round-about way of saying that I know in the analytical part of my brain that I should probably be paying $130 or more for a new video game like \u003cem\u003eCivilization VII\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that analytical portion of my brain gets overruled by the my wider view of tech where hardware has gotten so much better over the years such that the price for whatever performance metric you choose has fallen regularly in a way that software capabilities have not kept up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr, to put it another way, there is no chance I want to go back to the computer I was using when any particular \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(series)\"\u003epast version of \u003cem\u003eCivilization\u003c/em\u003e launched\u003c/a\u003e… even the machine I had in 2016 when \u003cem\u003eCivilization VI\u003c/em\u003e launched is now two upgrades ago… but I am not convinced that \u003cem\u003eCivilization VII\u003c/em\u003e will offer me an experience that will surpass any of those past titles in the series.  And, thanks to Steam and a bit of work on my own, I can go back today and \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2023/04/07/playing-the-different-generations-of-civilization-today/\"\u003eplay \u003cem\u003eCiv II\u003c/em\u003e through \u003cem\u003eCiv VI\u003c/em\u003e on demand\u003c/a\u003e.  It is unclear to me what is \u003cem\u003eCiv VII\u003c/em\u003e bringing to the table that will improve upon past titles besides improved graphical fidelity, and overwrought graphics have always impaired the actual game play of the franchise in my opinion.  I end up turning most of that down or off pretty quickly as it becomes noise in the way of the actual game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich is, of course, part of the problem the video games industry is in.  Old games exist and we still play them.  Again, that report I linked above notes that titles the mastered the revenue growth engines of the last decade are still active and holding audiences meaning that any new game needs some net new players to match something like \u003cem\u003eFortnite\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eRoblox\u003c/em\u003e… and that just isn’t happening.  Even me still playing some old \u003cem\u003eCiv\u003c/em\u003e title rather than the fresh new version is hindering success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that is all before I see Firaxis and their content plan that looks like it will be trying to make up the development costs by selling civilizations and leaders piecemeal before we even get to the inevitable first expansion.  When I’m looking at a classic 4x strategy title rolling itself like a live service experience with what will no doubt be something akin to a subscription… well, it had better be damn good… like a \u003cem\u003eCiv\u003c/em\u003e blow and hookers experience to get past my initial skepticism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ll see.  The world is turning me into a hardened cynic so everything starts to look like scam or cash grab or some sort of intentional deception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I will be keeping an eye on reviews and evaluations of the game and I will, at some future point likely own a copy via Steam.  But not today.  I’ll let you rush ahead and blaze that trail.  I might get out an older version of the game to see if that gets me more in the mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
