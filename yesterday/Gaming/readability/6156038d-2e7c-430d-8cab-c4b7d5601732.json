That’s right, your favorite armed mammal is almost ready to clean up the town by taking down those pesky suited-up Agents. And just when you thought Squirrel With a Gun couldn’t get any more packed with squirrely goodness, we have a whole set of free updates planned and incoming. Today we’ll give you a taste of two major updates, the new Photo Mode releasing October 15 and the Boss Battle update coming in the near future. Who knew that a single squirrel would have so much to do, ey? Serve squirrely lewks with Photo Mode Get ready to capture your most epic squirrel moments with the new Photo Mode! Whether you’re pulling off a daring escape, doing something wicked-cool mid-air, or making new friends in the neighborhood, you can now snap and save all those unforgettable moments. The best part is that there are plenty of modes to help you create the perfect shot.  First up is the classic Cam Adjust Mode, which helps you control the camera like a pro. Move the camera around, rotate it, and even give it a dramatic Dutch angle for some serious flair. Zoom in and out with the Field of View (FoV) slider to frame your perfect shot, whether you’re up close and personal or catching the action from afar. Next up is the Focus Mode. Add a touch of photography magic by playing with the camera’s focus. Choose the Player setting to keep the focus on you (because let’s face it, you’re the star), or go full-on creative with Manual Mode, where you control the focal distance for that perfect screenshot. And finally, the Filter Mode. Why settle for ordinary when you can add a touch of whimsy to your photos? With 15 unique filters to collect, such as the cute kawaii-esqe filter, or the timeless and still oh-so relevant awesome meme face filter, you can turn every snapshot into something truly memorable or hilarious. Prepare to face a legendary boss Coming in one of our later updates, a new boss and boss battle are slowly brewing behind the scenes. Your foe is the legendary Ratatoskr, the squirrel of Norse legends. Forcibly allied with the Agents, you must climb to the heavens and battle this mythical rodent so it won’t destroy the neighborhood. This boss fight is unlike any of the other battles you will face. This squirrel moves fast, has a variety of ranged and melee attacks, and is a considerably smaller target! Fortunately, you will be granted a special SMG with a magazine of infinite bullets for this grandiose occasion. Now that’s not all that’s coming to the neighborhood. You can expect new outfits, a whole new level, new furs, and perhaps even a game-changing gadget from the lab that can alter gravity itself! All of these updates are coming to Squirrel With a Gun free of charge. We want to keep the fun going as long as we can! Squirrel With a Gun is coming to PS5 on October 15! Trending Stories",
