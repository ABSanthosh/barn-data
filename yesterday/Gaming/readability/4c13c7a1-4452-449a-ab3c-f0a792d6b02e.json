  "text": "SummaryFor The King II is coming to Xbox Game Pass on December 12!Adventure with a bigger party, enjoy updated combat and a ton of new mechanics.Learn some top tips to get started from IronOak Games’ Studio Director. Hello Adventurers! Today marks a huge milestone for our small studio, IronOak Games. We are ecstatic to let the Xbox community know that you will be able to play For the King II via Xbox Game Pass on December 12! We expect there to be hardened veterans of For the King reading this, but new recruits are joining the ranks of the Resistance, so gather round and let us tell you more about what awaits you… For The King II is the sequel to the massively popular For The King. Building on the successes of its predecessor, For The King II follows suit by bringing innovation and exciting gameplay to a much-loved RPG that blends the borders of rogue-lite elements and tabletop gameplay. There’s multiplayer, grid-based combat, fantastical adventure, and it’s flooded with opportunities for terrible party decisions. What more could you want? We have already been out for a year on Steam, which means Xbox users will receive the best version of the game, including the new infinite dungeon mode, skins, items, and plenty more! So, what is threatening Fahrul, you ask? The once beloved Queen Rosomon has turned against her subjects, gained immeasurable power, and partnered with nefarious forces both old and new. Gather your party in four player co-op, or adventure alone through Fahrul as you risk everything to fight the tyrannical queen and bring an end to her oppressive reign. Entering Fahrul For The First Time? Each biome has a Sanctum and a Stone Hero. Make sure to find each of them before moving into a new area. Sanctums give great buffs and a revive, while Stone Heroes are crucial to help level up quickly. The Biggest Changes Between For The King and For The King II The most obvious change is that we’ve expanded the party size. For The King II allows up to four players so you can have a bigger party, or you can play in a group of two and no one is the odd person out now that each can control two characters. Another really big change is combat. Combat now takes place on a grid, rather than a single line. We’ve added a ton of new mechanics that allow for AOE spells, movement across tiles, tile buffs and debuffs, row attacks. There are a lot of ways to take on the baddies of Fahrul. Perfect Party Composition I like to head out into Fahrul with the Hunter, Herbalist, Busker, and Blacksmith. This gives me a blend of magical and physical damage while getting a good range of flexibility across most stats. After unlocking more characters I do like to run with the Alchemist equipped with the Nimble trait. What Makes For The King II Replayable? Two areas really stick out for me with how replayable and addictive FTKII is. Multiplayer being one, it’s a great game to hop in and out of with different friend groups, and different playstyles; two, there are so many ways to approach each chapter, or the Dark Carnival that no two runs are ever the same. Thank you for being part of our next chapter, and we hope you enjoy For The King II!",
