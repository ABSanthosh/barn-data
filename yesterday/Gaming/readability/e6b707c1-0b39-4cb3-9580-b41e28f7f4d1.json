  "text": "Can Series S still deliver a worthwhile take on this brilliant game? Image credit: id Software The Doom Slayer is back with a vengeance in Doom: The Dark Ages. This feudal-flavoured first-person frenzy promises revamped combat and revitalized visuals for current-gen consoles and PCs. In broad strokes, this is a strong technical success but how well does the game play out across PS5, PS5 Pro, Xbox Series X and especially the horsepower-challenged Xbox Series S? In all cases, users are getting a good experience, but the premium Xbox console seems to get the smoothest experience overall - even compared to PS5 Pro - while the junior Xbox is still recognisably the same game, but with very low rendering resolutions and a haircut to some visual features. Overall though, Doom: The Dark Ages is a phenomenal experience: there's something so satisfying about the raw visual feedback you get when blasting away demons. Chunks of flesh are blown off in an evolution of the destructible demons system from Doom Eternal. Particles bloom and dance as foes are shot and lit aflame. Environment elements disintegrate into physicalised pieces, ripped apart by the wide spread of weapons like the Pulveriser - and this all generally runs at 60fps on every machine, with excellent per-pixel motion blur to keep things looking buttery smooth. Even when you stop to smell the roses though, Dark Ages continues to excel visually. Doom's artwork is top-notch, and the rendering systems used to support that artistic vision really deliver. Expect intricate physically-based materials, rich environmental geometry and excellent RTGI-based lighting that makes the game look consistent across a wide range of lighting conditions. It's a top-notch effort that deserves considerable praise, especially considering that the scope of the game has been expanded considerably since Doom Eternal, with titanic mech sections, wide-open dragon combat, and larger on-foot gameplay arenas with more foes. We've got a deeper analysis of the core technology coming soon, but we came away suitably impressed by what the game has to offer. It feels like a considerable evolution above recent idTech titles and offers an unparalleled demon-destroying experience. Doom: The Dark Ages - DF Review - PS5/PS5 Pro/Xbox Series X|S Console Showdown Here's our video breakdown of Doom: The Dark Ages on each of the major consoles.Watch on YouTube In terms of platform-specific details, let's start with Xbox Series X, which delivers a pretty version of the game in its sole visual mode. I believe we're looking at a dynamic 1440p resolution, dropping down to around 1080p in busier scenes. Variable rate shading also appears to be employed, in common with other idTech games on current-gen consoles. Image quality is fine enough, though it can be a touch soft at times and VRS artefacts can be unflattering. In terms of visual settings, I didn't find the game wanting - except perhaps for the lack of ray traced reflections, which are featured on PC and seem relatively light even on console-class GPUs. The Series X relies on more primitive reflections tech, leaning heavily on screen-space reflections. Also, there's some occasional harsh shadow pop-in, which is more obvious in larger levels. Performance is more or less perfect in my testing. Even in intense gameplay, we're looking at a locked 60fps update without dips. It's possible the game could drop frames of course, especially in later sections, but in my gameplay I only saw a clean 60fps update. There do appear to be duplicate frames on camera cuts though in cutscenes, which is a common artifact across the consoles. The object and camera motion blur work here to greatly enhance the perception of fluidity and comes with multiple intensity settings to suit different tastes - including the option to turn it off entirely. There are other visual tweakables here, even though there's only one visual mode. Toggles for depth of field and chromatic aberration are present, as is a slider to engage the game's sharpening. I don't think the sharpening slider is working consistently in this version though, as changing its values doesn't actually appear to change anything on-screen. There's also a slider for field of view, but this doesn't appear to work on Series X, at least not consistently. A toggle for film grain would have been welcome as well, but it isn't present here for some reason, though it does appear on PC. Dark Ages has a rather strong film grain that is easy to spot in darker regions of the image and it can't be turned off on any console. I don't think anyone was particularly expecting a bad experience on Series X but the much weaker Series S is much more of a concern. It's mostly a similar enough experience - just a very soft one. Series S peaks at about 864p, again with VRS in use, with dips to about 648p in heavier scenes. Expect a blurrier image with a smeared appearance on fine geometry and textures. At close range, fidelity on a 4K panel can look pretty rough, and image stability is decreased as well. The UI is also of a lower resolution. Other differences stem from visual settings tweaks. Foliage density is reduced, for instance, especially at a distance. The game's textures and materials see some light tweaks as well, though any concessions here are minor up close. Ray traced global illumination (RTGI) quality appears to be downgraded with a somewhat less defined depiction of light occlusion around complex structures. First-person weaponry is also impacted by indirect lighting changes, while volumetric lighting is also of a lower resolution. Meanwhile, shadowmaps are also coarser and more aliasing-prone. Low-lying volumetric fog also proves rougher. There are some other changes too, like how the depth of field is somewhat shallower in cutscenes, which may be driven by resolution changes. Overall though, it's a fairly feature-complete Series S version, at least for a boundary-pushing current-gen game. Most of the little details, like screen-space shadows, are still present at close distances. Ray tracing is still part of the feature set and looks handsome enough, and visual settings in general remain reasonable. It's just delivered through a low-res, VRS-stricken haze. Performance is not quite as good as Series X. The great majority of gameplay still runs at 60fps, thankfully, but there are dips, particularly in larger gameplay spaces. This open-air fight at the outset of level 6 is a good example, with many dips into the 50s in this sequence. Expect similar results during this interior face-off in level 2, which is unexpectedly heavy. I didn't have time to get as far in Dark Ages as I'd like, but I would expect similar behaviour in other taxing fights. Series S also suffers from some screen-tearing artifacts near the top of the screen, which present oddly and aren't possible to track with our tools. These are not terribly noticeable but you can spot them if you go hunting for them. It's possible Series X has similar behaviour, but it doesn't drop frames nearly as often, if at all, so there would be little opportunity to witness them. Stress-testing Doom: The Dark Ages, it's Xbox Series X that runs smoothest overall, even beating PS5 Pro. The Pro runs at the highest resolution, while (not surprisingly), the hit to pixel count on Series S is quite profound. Click on the images for higher resolution. The two PS5s are a little more straightforward. Base PS5 players can expect a similar visual experience to their Series X compatriots with largely equivalent settings across the board. The biggest difference I noticed came in the sixth level, where most of the trees don't animate with the wind on Series X, but do animate on PS5. Their shadowmaps also move on PS5 of course, though this does exacerbate aliasing slightly. Foliage placement also differs slightly on PS5. Outside of those tweaks, I didn't spot any obvious visual settings differences between the two consoles. Expect more or less identical shadows, textures, distant LODs, and ray tracing detail. The FOV slider actually does appear to work consistently on the PlayStation consoles, however, though the sharpening slider remains ineffective. Image quality between the two machines is again similar. Most scenes look very close, though Series X is a touch sharper overall. Interestingly, the PS5 also appears to use a form of VRS, as it has distinctive, blocky artifacts in the image, though this is presumably a software-based iteration as the base PS5 lacks hardware VRS hardware. Unfortunately, the omnipresent film grain makes it a little tougher to see some of the finer details. Resolutions are similar to Series X in demanding content at around 1080p and again it tops out around 1440p, but I think PS5 typically comes in a little lower than Series X. Performance is a little curious. Here, the PS5 drops frames regularly during demanding encounters and during some less challenging fights as well. The overall frame-rate fluidity is lower than Series X by a good margin and actually feels a bit lower than Series S. Most gameplay still flies by at 60, but it's definitely in the 50s more often than I'd like to see, especially considering the impeccable performance of its Microsoft counterpart. But unlike Series S, the PlayStation consoles don't tear at the top of the screen when they do drop frames. A much reduced resolution, impacted performance, lower quality RTGI, pared back shadows, more intrusive VRS artefacts and more separate Xbox Series S from the Series X version. Click on the images for higher resolution. PS5 Pro is a fairly straightforward upgrade over the base console. Expect a more-or-less total match in visual settings with PS5, with identical tweakables across both machines. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though some selective settings bumps might have been interesting. Instead, image quality gets boosted somewhat with a new 1800p target. It looks sharper than the PS5's 1440p target and the size of the VRS blocks is substantially reduced. More demanding scenes take you down closer to 1296p or so. TAA treatment appears similar to the other machines, so there's no PSSR or similar upsampling in effect here. This is one of the less exciting Pro upgrades we've seen in recent triple-A fare. Frame-rates are generally good here, with a stable 60fps in most content. But those two particularly challenging combats still provoke minor frame-rate dips, which is not ideal. It's no major concern, and performance is better than PS5 by a good margin, but Series X remains king. Doom: The Dark Ages didn't make the best first impression on me. The game strips out the double jump and double dash from Eternal, which can make it feel less dynamic and exciting. There was something so delightful about the movement tech in Eternal that doesn't really translate to Dark Ages, and it takes some time to adapt to the new reality. Plus, the first few missions dole out new tech and weapons at a slow pace, but after a few hours practising the blocking and parrying paradigm, Dark Ages proves a highly satisfying game in its own right. Blocking feels fairer than trying to simply evade every enemy attack, which doesn't provide the same intuitive feedback. Many combat elements return from Eternal, but more of the basic combat tech has been made universal - like the new shield bash ability, which replaces the Super Shotgun hook from Eternal. I'd also say that the moment-to-moment combat is some of the absolute best in any modern single-player FPS - and it takes place in more open levels with good variety in enemy encounters, which is a nice break from the arena-focused, wave-based combat of the two prior Doom titles. Based on my history with the series, I can easily imagine spending dozens and dozens of hours with this game. Our PC-focused coverage will appear in due course but impressions to date strongly suggest that the console versions are in relatively solid shape. Visual features are good across the board and image quality is reasonable on everything bar Xbox Series S. Performance is a little odd, insofar as every machine but the Series X seems to suffer from substantial dips in more challenging fights though 60fps is still achieved the great majority of the time. Series X also crashed at one point, and I ran into a bugged checkpoint at one time on Series S that required a level restart. Those aren't big issues and generally Dark Ages is a really satisfying experience on PS5 and Xbox Series, but there are some issues that do warrant patching. Overall, Doom: The Dark Ages is a superb shooter that is well worth your time on console systems, minus some small current quirks, and I'd rank it as one of the best action experiences I've had in recent years.",

It\u0026#39;s possible Series X has similar behaviour, but it doesn\u0026#39;t drop frames nearly as often, if at all, so there would be little opportunity to witness them. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure data-count=\"4\" role=\"group\"\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" data-src-full=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Doom-X.jpg?width=1920\u0026amp;height=1920\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\" height=\"388\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Doom-X.jpg?width=690\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\" srcset=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Doom-X.jpg?width=690\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;auto=webp 1x, https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Doom-X.jpg?width=690\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;auto=webp 2x\" width=\"690\"/\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" data-src-full=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Doom-S.jpg?width=1920\u0026amp;height=1920\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\" height=\"388\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Doom-S.jpg?width=690\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\" srcset=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Doom-S.jpg?width=690\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;auto=webp 1x, https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Doom-S.jpg?width=690\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;auto=webp 2x\" width=\"690\"/\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" data-src-full=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Doom-PS5-Pro.jpg?width=1920\u0026amp;height=1920\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\" height=\"388\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Doom-PS5-Pro.jpg?width=690\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\" srcset=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Doom-PS5-Pro.jpg?width=690\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;auto=webp 1x, https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Doom-PS5-Pro.jpg?width=690\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;auto=webp 2x\" width=\"690\"/\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" data-src-full=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Doom-PS5.jpg?width=1920\u0026amp;height=1920\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\" height=\"388\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Doom-PS5.jpg?width=690\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\" srcset=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Doom-PS5.jpg?width=690\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;auto=webp 1x, https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Doom-PS5.jpg?width=690\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;auto=webp 2x\" width=\"690\"/\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003eStress-testing Doom: The Dark Ages, it\u0026#39;s Xbox Series X that runs smoothest overall, even beating PS5 Pro. The Pro runs at the highest resolution, while (not surprisingly), the hit to pixel count on Series S is quite profound. Click on the images for higher resolution.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe two PS5s are a little more straightforward. Base PS5 players can expect a similar visual experience to their Series X compatriots with largely equivalent settings across the board. The biggest difference I noticed came in the sixth level, where most of the trees don\u0026#39;t animate with the wind on Series X, but do animate on PS5. Their shadowmaps also move on PS5 of course, though this does exacerbate aliasing slightly. Foliage placement also differs slightly on PS5. Outside of those tweaks, I didn\u0026#39;t spot any obvious visual settings differences between the two consoles. Expect more or less identical shadows, textures, distant LODs, and ray tracing detail. The FOV slider actually does appear to work consistently on the PlayStation consoles, however, though the sharpening slider remains ineffective. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nImage quality between the two machines is again similar. Most scenes look very close, though Series X is a touch sharper overall. Interestingly, the PS5 also appears to use a form of VRS, as it has distinctive, blocky artifacts in the image, though this is presumably a software-based iteration as the base PS5 lacks hardware VRS hardware. Unfortunately, the omnipresent film grain makes it a little tougher to see some of the finer details. Resolutions are similar to Series X in demanding content at around 1080p and again it tops out around 1440p, but I think PS5 typically comes in a little lower than Series X. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nPerformance is a little curious. Here, the PS5 drops frames regularly during demanding encounters and during some less challenging fights as well. The overall frame-rate fluidity is lower than Series X by a good margin and actually feels a bit lower than Series S. Most gameplay still flies by at 60, but it\u0026#39;s definitely in the 50s more often than I\u0026#39;d like to see, especially considering the impeccable performance of its Microsoft counterpart. But unlike Series S, the PlayStation consoles don\u0026#39;t tear at the top of the screen when they do drop frames. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure data-count=\"4\" role=\"group\"\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" data-src-full=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/SX-1.jpg?width=1920\u0026amp;height=1920\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\" height=\"388\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/SX-1.jpg?width=690\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\" srcset=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/SX-1.jpg?width=690\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;auto=webp 1x, https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/SX-1.jpg?width=690\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;auto=webp 2x\" width=\"690\"/\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" data-src-full=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/SX-2.jpg?width=1920\u0026amp;height=1920\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\" height=\"388\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/SX-2.jpg?width=690\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\" srcset=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/SX-2.jpg?width=690\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;auto=webp 1x, https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/SX-2.jpg?width=690\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;auto=webp 2x\" width=\"690\"/\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" data-src-full=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/SX-3.jpg?width=1920\u0026amp;height=1920\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\" height=\"388\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/SX-3.jpg?width=690\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\" srcset=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/SX-3.jpg?width=690\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;auto=webp 1x, https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/SX-3.jpg?width=690\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;auto=webp 2x\" width=\"690\"/\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" data-src-full=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/SX-4.jpg?width=1920\u0026amp;height=1920\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\" height=\"388\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/SX-4.jpg?width=690\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\" srcset=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/SX-4.jpg?width=690\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;auto=webp 1x, https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/SX-4.jpg?width=690\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;format=jpg\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;auto=webp 2x\" width=\"690\"/\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003eA much reduced resolution, impacted performance, lower quality RTGI, pared back shadows, more intrusive VRS artefacts and more separate Xbox Series S from the Series X version. Click on the images for higher resolution.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nPS5 Pro is a fairly straightforward upgrade over the base console. Expect a more-or-less total match in visual settings with PS5, with identical tweakables across both machines. That\u0026#39;s not necessarily a bad thing, though some selective settings bumps might have been interesting. Instead, image quality gets boosted somewhat with a new 1800p target. It looks sharper than the PS5\u0026#39;s 1440p target and the size of the VRS blocks is substantially reduced. More demanding scenes take you down closer to 1296p or so. TAA treatment appears similar to the other machines, so there\u0026#39;s no PSSR or similar upsampling in effect here. This is one of the less exciting Pro upgrades we\u0026#39;ve seen in recent triple-A fare. Frame-rates are generally good here, with a stable 60fps in most content. But those two particularly challenging combats still provoke minor frame-rate dips, which is not ideal. It\u0026#39;s no major concern, and performance is better than PS5 by a good margin, but Series X remains king.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nDoom: The Dark Ages didn\u0026#39;t make the best first impression on me. The game strips out the double jump and double dash from Eternal, which can make it feel less dynamic and exciting. There was something so delightful about the movement tech in Eternal that doesn\u0026#39;t really translate to Dark Ages, and it takes some time to adapt to the new reality. Plus, the first few missions dole out new tech and weapons at a slow pace, but after a few hours practising the blocking and parrying paradigm, Dark Ages proves a highly satisfying game in its own right. Blocking feels fairer than trying to simply evade every enemy attack, which doesn\u0026#39;t provide the same intuitive feedback. Many combat elements return from Eternal, but more of the basic combat tech has been made universal - like the new shield bash ability, which replaces the Super Shotgun hook from Eternal.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nI\u0026#39;d also say that the moment-to-moment combat is some of the absolute best in any modern single-player FPS - and it takes place in more open levels with good variety in enemy encounters, which is a nice break from the arena-focused, wave-based combat of the two prior Doom titles. Based on my history with the series, I can easily imagine spending dozens and dozens of hours with this game. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nOur PC-focused coverage will appear in due course but impressions to date strongly suggest that the console versions are in relatively solid shape. Visual features are good across the board and image quality is reasonable on everything bar Xbox Series S. Performance is a little odd, insofar as every machine but the Series X seems to suffer from substantial dips in more challenging fights though 60fps is still achieved the great majority of the time. Series X also crashed at one point, and I ran into a bugged checkpoint at one time on Series S that required a level restart. Those aren\u0026#39;t big issues and generally Dark Ages is a really satisfying experience on PS5 and Xbox Series, but there are some issues that do warrant patching. Overall, Doom: The Dark Ages is a superb shooter that is well worth your time on console systems, minus some small current quirks, and I\u0026#39;d rank it as one of the best action experiences I\u0026#39;ve had in recent years. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
