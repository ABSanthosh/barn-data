This is similar to the model that's listed on Samsung for $350 except without the USB Type-C port. Nonetheless, this is an excellent price for one of the sharpest monitors on the market. The ViewFinity S8 isn't a monitor I would recommend for gaming (there are much better options), but it does make for an outstanding productivity monitor.Today Only: 60% Off 27\" Samsung ViewFinity S8 4K Monitor27\" Samsung ViewFinity S8 4K IPS MonitorThe Samsung ViewFinity S8 is a 27\" monitor with a true 4K (3840x2160) resolution. That averages out to 163ppi. The only type of monitor that's sharper would be the 27\" 5K models like the one Apple sells for $1600. You could set up a dual 27\" multi-monitor setup with double 4K UHD resolution that would nearly equal the size of the Samsung Neo G9 57\" double 4K UHD monitor and it would cost you a mere fraction of the price. This kind of sharpness combined with the relatively smaller size of the monitor would be wasted on video games (especially since you'd also need to get yourself a more powerful GPU), but is great for any kind of pixel perfect or text heavy productivity work.The rest of the featureset is also geared towards productivity. The IPS panel boasts wide viewing angles and an accurate 99% sRGB color space. It offers both HDMI and DisplayPort connections, and USB Type-A and Type-B ports. The refresh rate is \"only\" 60Hz, but again, that's because this isn't meant for gaming.Keep in mind that this is Best Buy's deal of the day and will likely expire at midnight. If you're looking to upgrade the rest of your workspace, check out the best office chairs (that also work great for gaming sessions, of course) and the best standing desks.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
