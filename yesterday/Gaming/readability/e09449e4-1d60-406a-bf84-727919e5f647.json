  "text": "November 12, 2024 by Call of Duty Staff Ready up for epic new content arriving in Season 01. Unlock 100+ rewards in the Battle Pass, deploy as molten hot BlackCell variants, and grab new Store Bundles like The Replacer, plus new Ultra Skins and Mastercraft Weapon Blueprints. Influence and Control the Season 01 Battle Pass! As Rogue Black Ops attempt to topple the Luttazzi Crime Family and drive Crimson One forces out of Avalon, Operators in the field are going to need the finest gear and weapons for the battles ahead. Ready up with the Season 01 Battle Pass, BlackCell, and Store content dropping into Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone™ on November 14, and throughout the first part of the season. An all-new Battle Pass System grants you the opportunity to earn 100+ rewards, including free base weapons, numerous Weapon Blueprints, Equipment Skins, Operator Skins, and much more. There are three ways to obtain some or all of this content: Earn 20+ free rewards, including cosmetic content and base weapons. Purchase the premium Battle Pass and earn up to 1,100 COD Points as you progress through the Battle Pass Pages. Or purchase BlackCell for the ultimate seasonal experience, including a variety of molten hot Operator Skins, Weapon Blueprints, COD points, and other rewards. Turning the Page: The Season 01 Battle Pass Expanded Overview The Season 01 Black Ops 6 Battle Pass is brimming over with content, which is both showcased and unlocked in a brand new “Page” system. Think of the Battle Pass as a book, with 17 total pages. The first Page displays BlackCell Instant Rewards and the second Page shows premium Battle Pass Instant Rewards, followed by 100 in-game Battle Pass rewards across 14 Pages and a Completion Page that is instantly unlocked once all other Pages are completed. Pages include Free and Paid content. As always, all Base Weapons are free to unlock. Purchase the premium Battle Pass for 1,100 COD Points for the ability to earn all Battle Pass rewards. For a head start on the season, grab the Battle Pass Bundle for 2,400 COD Points, including 20+ Tier Skips. Starting Your Battle Pass Journey: Page 1 The Season 01 Battle Pass Instant Rewards Page As you start your new Battle Pass journey, the Instant Reward Page and Page 1 are unlocked by default. All the other Pages are locked but can be previewed. Your goal is to complete the Battle Pass and access the 100 percent Completion Page at the end of the Battle Pass. The Season 01 Battle Pass Page 1 Each Page contains a slight variation on the following: Around six item rewards (known as “Tiers”) that are unlocked in any order you wish within the Page. Each requires an earned Battle Pass Token to unlock. Each Page (except for the BlackCell, Instant, and Completion Pages) contains up to two free Tier rewards. The rest are unlocked via purchasing the premium Battle Pass, BlackCell, or the Vault Edition An “HVT” (High Value Target) Tier reward is unlocked once all the previous items on that page are unlocked. This is usually an Operator Skin or Weapon Blueprint, and sometimes there’s a BlackCell variant. When both the regular and HVT Tiers are unlocked, the Page is complete. Use the Auto Claim feature to automatically unlock rewards as you play. Or turn it off to earn Battle Pass Tokens used to manually claim rewards. Battle Tokens: Unlocking a Page The Season 01 Battle Pass Page 6, with Tiers needed to unlock (from Page 1). Battle Pass Tokens make their return to the Battle Pass and work in a similar way to those in previous Battle Passes. A Token Bank is displayed in the top-right corner of your Battle Pass. These are used to unlock the l reward Tiers across all 14 Pages. Premium Battle Pass and BlackCell owners can spend these Tokens on any available Tier reward on an unlocked Page. Tiers can also be automatically unlocked by turning on the Auto Claim feature; with this feature, Tokens are spent as they are earned and not deposited in a Token Bank. Players who do not own the premium Battle Pass earn free rewards in a linear order and do not have access to Tokens. Unlocking Later Pages The Season 01 Battle Pass Page 7. If there is a reward in a later Page that catches your eye, you simply need to earn enough Battle Tokens to unlock that Page and its Tier content. BlackCell owners get the bonus of unlocking a single Battle Pass Page at any point, regardless of whether the Pages before it are unlocked. Begin unlocking Tier Rewards on that Page immediately. Each new Page requires reaching a certain threshold of claimed Tiers before it unlocks; you don’t have to complete an entire Page to access the next one. BlackCell Season 01: Goliath Operator (Rogue Black Ops) BlackCell Instant Rewards Page, HVT Join the molten, crystalized skull-headed Goliath as he stalks the epic Season 01 BlackCell content. Featuring the “Goliath” Operator Skin with writhing flames across his onyx carapace armor, this orange-hued demon favors fiery combat and swift deaths. Goliath is part of an impressive BlackCell offering that brings the heat, delivering Operators clad in true Black Ops style with deep blacks and ‘fiery’ orange accent hues. Additional BlackCell Instant Rewards Content Upgrade your Battle Pass Experience: Purchase BlackCell to gain complete access to all the amazing rewards offered in the Season 01 Battle Pass. Owners will gain immediate access to the BlackCell Instant Rewards page, acquiring the following items: 20 Battle Pass Tier Skips 1,100 COD Points The “Boiling Point” Mastercraft Weapon Blueprint for the Goblin Mk2 (Assault Rifle) that’s literally dripping with molten heat including a first-of-its-kind unique weapon inspect animation. The “Who’s Laughing Now” Finishing Move with Companion Hyena. The “BlackCell” Clan Tag (showcased in Lobbies and Winner’s Circles). The “Goliath” New Operator. Additionally, BlackCell owners can expect to access page after page of additional rewards within the Season 01 Battle Pass. These include: Seven BlackCell-exclusive Operator Skins for: Sev (two Skins), Bayan, Bailey, Carver, Alvarez, and Stone. Six BlackCell-exclusive Weapon Blueprints for the XM4 (Assault Rifle), Marine SP (Shotgun), Tsarkov 7.62 (Marksman Rifle), GPMG-7 (LMG), Saug (SMG), Krig C (Assault Rifle). The ability to unlock any single Page from the Battle Pass, ignoring the usual minimum Tier requirements. From here, you can unlock the Tiers within that Page, and progress forwards (or backwards) from the Page provided the subsequent Tier unlock criteria is met. NEW: Access to BlackCell-themed rewards throughout Season 01, offering earnable content throughout the Season. Over 130 Rewards (Battle Pass and BlackCell related) for those who fully complete the Season 01 BlackCell Battle Pass. As usual, players who upgrade to BlackCell after purchasing the Battle Pass will also receive 1,100 COD Points back. Vault Edition Upgrade If you’re considering an upgrade to the Black Ops 6 Vault Edition, this is the time to do it! For the same price as the BlackCell offering ($30 or your regional equivalent), the Vault Edition entitles you to the very same Season 01 BlackCell offering, along with the following: The Hunters vs. Hunted Operator Pack featuring Operator Skins for Adler, Park, Brutus, and Klaus. The Mastercraft Weapon Collection (five weapons). The GobbleGum Pack (12 single-use consumables). Woods Operator Pack Note for Prestige Players: Any Weapon Blueprint and Equipment Skin you unlock in the Battle Pass is permanently unlocked and does not re-lock when you subsequently Prestige. Purchase the Battle Pass: Instantly Unlock Sev Operator When you purchase the premium Battle Pass or BlackCell, you immediately unlock the Battle Pass Instant Rewards Page, including the following items: 10% Battle Pass XP Boost. The “Superbloom” Frag Grenade Skin. The “Thorn” Legendary Blueprint for the Tanto .22 SMG. The “Rose Goes” Legendary Weapon Sticker. The new Sev Operator and “Sev” Skin, along with the “Sev BlackCell” Operator Skin for BlackCell owners. Sevati “Sev” Dumas (Rogue Black Ops) Battle Pass Instant Reward Page, HVT A main player in the Rogue Team after the conclusion of the Campaign, Sev is ready to make a deal with the untrustworthy French Syndicate and is gearing up to take down the rival Luttazzi family to prove it. Sporting two different Skins, depending on the infiltration mission at hand, she’s more than ready to lead the charge. Additional Battle Pass Operator Skins Complete Battle Pass Pages and choose content to unlock, including a variety of Operator Skins, many paired with an molten hot Animated BlackCell variants: Bayan: “Drifter” Skins Operator Skins, Battle Pass and BlackCell, HVT, Page 2 Bayan is clad for dark ops with dark gray and black tactical attire, including a black balaclava, gloves, and pouches. His alternate BlackCell form features cracked lava, embers and smoke rising from his jacket, and a featureless mask with glowing eye sockets. Maya: “Underground” Skin Operator Skin, Battle Pass, Page 3 Maya lets her hair down and travels light, dropping her jacket in favor of a burgundy tank top, braces and a pair of camo pants. Bailey: “Anarchist” Skins Operator Skins, Battle Pass and BlackCell, HVT, Page 4 Dropping her mask and going for a clean tactical look, top-knot, face tattoo and a light combat jacket in black and white with red piping. Her BlackCell variant changes the outfit to a black and molten orange, burning flecks of fire emanating from her, and a glowing hand tattoo. Carver: “Tarnished” Skins Operator Skins, Battle Pass and BlackCell, HVT, Page 7 Mac is on the hunt and comes prepped with a camo vest with numerous pouches, a snakeskin-sheathed hunting knife, a shock of white hair and neck gaiter. In his BlackCell form, Carver goes molten, smoking with fire while his face-covering sports a pair of tactical goggles reflecting an inferno inside. Alvarez: “Flight Path” Skins Operator Skins, Battle Pass and BlackCell, HVT, Page 9 Clad in fighter pilot combat gear with front pouches, a comms radio and large helmet with reflective visor and purple accents, Alvarez sports a rust and black BlackCell variant with animated flames scorching across her helmet visor. Nazir: “Slick Style” Skin Operator Skin, Battle Pass, Page 11 Clad for rappelling maneuvers in a swift and sleek manner, Nazir goes with a combat jacket and decides on red gloves, matching crimson tactical joggers, and lower torso buckles. Stone: “Zip Tie” Skins Operator Skins, Battle Pass and BlackCell, HVT, Page 12 Stone changes his usual combat plans and aims to take prisoners as his deep gray combat fatigues and camo pouches that also come with a set of zip ties. Under his hood, Stone wears a set of cyclopean vision goggles. His BlackCell variant switches up the outfit to black, and the augmentations to glowing orange. Rossi: “Mean Streets” Skin Operator Skin, Battle Pass, Page 13 Channeling a more dapper style from a bygone era, Rossi’s hair is slicked back with a cowlick, a neck scarf, shirt and braces, and suit trousers, with room to pack a pistol and comms radio. Niran: “Big Slick” Skin Operator Skin, Battle Pass, Page 14 While pinstripe pants and a biker’s jacket might not work on some Operators, Niran pulls off the look with badass aplomb, including sporty shades with tactical side shields. Season 01: Battle Pass Base Weapons Perhaps the two most important Battle Pass Pages are the ones containing a new Base Weapon. All players can access these for free (as always) at Season 01 Launch. Saug Submachine Gun Battle Pass, HVT, Page 3 Levels: 39 MAGS: 4 MAG SIZE: 36 Mastery Badges: Yes Attachments: Optic, Muzzle, Barrel, Underbarrel, Magazine, Rear Grip, Stock, Laser, Fire Mods Customize Options: Skins, Reticle Unlocks (MP, ZM, WZ), Accessories (1), Decals (1), Stickers 3). Military Camos: 21 (MP, ZM, WZ) Special Camos: 6 (MP, ZM, WZ) Mastery Camos: 12 (MP, ZM, WZ) Fully automatic submachine gun. Excellent mobility and good handling. Great rate of fire. High recoil. Pepper your enemies with a hailstorm of lead using this rapid-fire SMG that’s perfect for breaching and clearing small spaces. Pull down when aiming down sights to counter the Saug’s recoil, or better yet, improve the weapon’s already great hip-fire capabilities with the appropriate attachments, including the Tactical Laser for a killer combo of mobility and accuracy via Tactical Stance. Or go all out on hip-fire with the Akimbo Saug Stock for unmatched SMG firepower. Krig C Assault Rifle Battle Pass, HVT, Page 6 Levels: 43 MAGS: 3 MAG SIZE: 30 Mastery Badges: Yes Attachments: Optic, Muzzle, Barrel, Underbarrel, Magazine, Rear Grip, Stock, Laser, Fire Mods Customize Options: Skins, Reticle Unlocks (MP, ZM, WZ), Accessories (1), Decals (1), Stickers 3). Military Camos: 21 (MP, ZM, WZ) Special Camos: 6 (MP, ZM, WZ) Mastery Camos: 12 (MP, ZM, WZ) Full-auto assault rifle. High damage and average handling. Recoil pattern starts very controllable before ramping up. For a hard-hitting, versatile Assault Rifle that performs well across multiple ranges, look no further than the Krig C. The weapon inflicts moderate damage across the whole body with a four-shot elimination within its effective range, three when accounting for headshots. Recoil control becomes shakier through sustained fire, so burst fire to retain accuracy or consider attachments offering improved control to help counter the ramped-up movement.
