  "text": "This RTX 5080 desktop is just $2,100 right now. Image credit: Dell / Alienware Black Friday is here (apparently), and while we’re fairly certain someone at Dell/Alienware needs a calendar for their birthday, there are some deals to be had in (just checking here), yep, July. Anyone looking for an Alienware Aurora desktop PC (which we acknowledge is a pretty specific group) is in luck, though. The manufacturer’s Black Friday in July (sigh) is down to just $2,099.99 – a $400 discount on the MSRP of this configuration. What configuration, you ask? One packing an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 GPU. Save $400 on this Alienware desktop I’ve always wanted to grab one of these Aurora models because they look so slick, but it’s not just the tasteful lighting that’s worth a look here. To get this deal, you’ll need to opt for the 5080 we’ve already mentioned, as well as the Intel Core Ultra 7 265F processor and 16GB of RAM. There’s a 1TB M.2 SSD inside for fast storage, and the build includes a liquid cooling solution, too. As with its bigger brother, the 5090, there’s a big focus on AI here, both for creative work and for increasing frames through the likes of DLSS.",
