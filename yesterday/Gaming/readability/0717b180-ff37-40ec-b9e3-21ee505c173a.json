  "text": "Image credit: Rockstar Games A day after dropping jaws and making the recently anounced delay even tougher to bare, Rockstar has confirmed GTA 6's hugely impressive second trailer was a mix of \"gameplay and cutscenes\" captured \"entirely in-game\" on a PlayStation 5. GTA 6's second trailer dropped earlier this week, offering a closer look at its world - which includes the return of the Miami-inspired Vice City - and its sprawling cast of characters than we saw in 2023's scene-setting first showing. Rockstar subsequently released detailed character breakdowns and dozens upon dozens of screenshots for eager fans to scrutinise still further. Inevitably, plenty of chatter immediately ensued, some of it lauding the incredible amount of detail on display, some of it frantically sharing screen captures of Jason's rippling torso, and some of it casting doubt on the little note at the end of the trailer claiming it was all captured on PS5. At the very least, people speculated, Rockstar must have surely meant PS5 Pro? Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2 - GTA 6 GTA 6's second trailer.Watch on YouTube But the developer has now moved to quell any lingering doubts, suggesting that, yes, everything we saw in its most recent trailer was indeed generated by Sony's now nearly five-year-old console, and all of it was in-game. \"Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 2 was captured entirely in-game from a PlayStation 5,\" the studio confirmed in a statement shared on social media, \"comprised of equal parts gameplay and cutscenes.\" So there you go; let dazzlement and bewonderment be yours. The downside to all this excitement, of course, is that GTA 6 is still some considerable way off following its recent delay. Publisher Take-Two Interactive had previously and repeatedly insisted GTA 6 would launch this autumn, but last week - after months of reports suggesting a delay was likely - Rockstar announced a new release date of 26th May next year, saying it needed \"this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.\" And while its new release date leaves a big GTA-shaped hole in the 2025 release schedule, it does at least mean publishers previously unwilling to commit to launch dates for their own titles fearing GTA 6's dominance are likely now moving quickly to fill the void. Earlier this year, game execs bemoaned the \"havoc\" Grand Theft Auto 6's lack of a release date was causing, with one saying, \"We don't want to be anywhere near that.\" With a full year still to go until GTA 6's arrival on Xbox Series X/S and PS5, it might be some time before Rockstar reveals more. But for those keeping track, here's everything we know so far.",
