Developer Cloud Imperium says the event \"presents a perfect opportunity to test out new ships, refresh on the basics of survival in space, and prepare to boldly explore a new frontier\". Star Citizen: Crusader Intrepid Star Citizen: Crusader Intrepid.Watch on YouTube \"Once players have completed the new player experience in their utilitarian Drake Cutter loaner ship they can rent any of the available ships to take on a series of missions including a bounty hunt, cargo hauling, mining, and visiting the IAE show floor themselves, to earn in-game UEC, IAE clothing, and an armour and weapon kit to jump-start their new life in space,\" the team added.New ships include the Terrapin Medic - \"a welcome sight to any injured explorer or soldier\" - whilst the F7C Mk II line expands with the F7C-R and the F7C-S, known as the \"Ghost\". CIG says \"there’s never been a better time to fly in Star Citizen\". Star Citizen has raised an astonishing $700m in crowdfunding. Cloud Imperium recently shared an extended gameplay reveal of its upcoming Star Citizen spin-off, Squadron 42, which will release in 2026.",
