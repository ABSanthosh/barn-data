  "text": "Image via Nuverse / Remix by The Escapist No, you can't fix this by swiping. | Published: May 29, 2025 11:14 am Crystal of Atlan, the new free-to-play MMORPG by Nuverse, has only been out for one day, and yet the only topic players seem to be talking about is how much they hate the Energy / Stamina System. This system, while common in other free-to-play games, is forcing players to stop playing early, and there doesn’t seem to be a way to remedy this, not even if you swipe your Credit Card. Crystal of Atlan utilizes an Energy System, similar to those found in many free-to-play games, especially Facebook games, where each activity consumes a certain amount of Stamina. Once the Energy runs out, the players are forced to stop playing the game. Screenshot by The Escapist You’re probably thinking that the game has a way to refill this annoying mechanic through items, and you’d be correct… kind of. Players can get Batteries, which, as the name suggests, replenish their Character Energy. There are three types of Batteries currently in the game, and each of them refills a different amount. Here’s the best part: You can’t buy these Batteries with real money. Players can get a few of them from non-premium loot crates and maybe one more from different exchanges, but even those who spend a lot of money won’t be able to avoid this roadblock. Have you tried Crystal of Atlan? Check out our Ultimate Crystal of Atlan Class Tier list if you need help picking your first class. Image via Discord Screenshot via Reddit Players on the official Crystal of Atlan Discord and Reddit have been extremely vocal about their feelings regarding the system. Some are posting memes about how ridiculous the Energy System is, while others are even saying how this will ultimately kill the game. Some are even saying they can run out of juice in under 10 minutes of playing the game. You can only buy Batteries very late in the game. Screenshot by The Escapist Upon creating their first character, players have only 120 Character Energy and 70 Account Energy. That may sound like a lot, but each story mission in the game takes 5 Energy, and late-game activities take even more. The Character Energy replenishes daily, but the same can’t be said for the Account one. Once players make it to the endgame, they can unlock another Energy pool for the entire account, but that’s only if they are willing to put up with this entire system in the first place, which is literally preventing them from playing. We really like Crystal of Atlan, and we’d like to see it thrive, but if the Energy mechanic isn’t addressed, players will become frustrated and find a new game.
