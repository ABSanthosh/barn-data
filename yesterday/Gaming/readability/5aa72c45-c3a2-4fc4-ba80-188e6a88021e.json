Hack’n’slash through hordes of enemies in procedurally generated dungeons, caves and lands and lead the Bergson family, with all their flaws and virtues, against the forthcoming Corruption. The story takes place in a distant land but copes with themes and emotions common to all of us: love and hope, longing and uncertainty, ultimately loss... and sacrifice we are willing to make to save the ones we care the most for. Ultimately, it's about a family of heroes standing together against the encroaching darkness. -- Complete Edition -- Both the Ancient Spirits and the Paws and Claws DLC are included in the main game and available as you play. Online coop will come soon in a post-launch update! FEATURES - Welcome to the family! Join the heroic Bergsons in their trials to honor their heritage and save the land of Rea from the creeping Corruption - One for all, all for one: improve skills and gear for the whole family through each run in the ever-changing world of this roguelite RPG - Stronger together: switch between 7 playable characters, each with their own abilities, fighting styles and endearing personality - Immerse yourself in the beautiful, deadly world of Rea through gorgeous 2D pixel art mixing handcrafted animations with modern lighting techniques - Family that slays together stays together: use the two-player online coop mode and rely on each other in every fight (available in a post-launch update) CAREFULLY REDESIGNED FOR MOBILE - Revamped interface – exclusive mobile UI with complete touch control - Game Center achievements - Cloud Save – Share your progress between iOS devices - Compatible with MFi controllers - iPhone 15 Optimization (including Pro Max) Genre:Action, Role Playing TouchArcade Rating:Unrated Compatibility:HD Universal Can’t wait to play this again, I never did finish it on my switch and I was enjoying my time with it. I played a bit last night. Looks good. Runs well. Everything you’ve come to expect from a Playdigious port by now. (And yes, including the smallish text size) But one thing that stands out to me is that the attack direction seems to be buggy. Even when you point in a particular direction when attacking, the attack happens in another direction. I played this a fair bit on PC so I know that version didn’t have this issue. And it’s important especially for a game like this. Otherwise, it’s the same brilliant game, just on a smaller screen. Hopefully the targeting issue gets fixed soon with a patch. Never played. But I LOVE a good roguelike. Just picked it up. Hope to play this evening. ste86uk and sebgo like this. Glad it wasnt just me then. Especially aiming down for me usually goes up.... I already reported the attack direction problem today, they said they would check the problem and give a feedback later. I can’t get past the tutorial. There is a spot it keeps freezing on me. Then it doesn’t save and I have to start all over. Tried a bunch of times. Game is a mess. I may ask for a refund. The aiming is terrible as well. Seems to be off to the side. Surprised this got released. It’s a big name Indy game and good publisher. I’ll wait for a fix possibly. But was aggravated reading the tutorial a bunch and not getting any further. Didn’t have any issues getting past the tutorial but, yeah, there’s definitely something off with the aiming. Hopefully they fix it soon. I read in their support that it might be a controller issue. If that’s the case, try finishing the tutorial with touch controls. Once done. Kill and relaunch the app, then you can use your controller to play and progress forward. They are actively working on a fix for this. This is what I thought it may be. I rarely use a controller. But figured for this game it would be a good fit. I have a backbone and something. Did seem off. There is no button for the one they are asking me to push. Usually you could touch the screen and the on screen display would come up. If not, you can take off the controller and continue using touch. But that’s not the case here. Once a controller is hooked up it’s your only option. Then you need to restart the app. This happened like 3 times before I got aggravated and went to do without a controller. That time the game froze during the tutorial and I gave up. Wasn’t fun at that point. I’ll wait for a fix or try again tonight without controller. But then there will always be the issue of no button option once going back to controller. Anyways thank you for your help. Much appreciated! I really don’t understand how a game launches with bugs like these. Weren’t these flagged by the QA team during testing. I mean the controller issue and the controls issue, these should be pretty straightforward to catch and a huge red flag unless fixed before release. Playdigious needs to start doing better. The quality of their ports have been gradually dropping. Text sizes, gameplay being rough, UIs too small and now this. This is really not cool. I don’t know why they don’t think about set a TestFlight to test the game first, I guess they just designed the port but seldom to test them. for now, it is better play long range characters, until they fixed problems. Apparently the app is not even eligible for refund. So I have no option but to leave a negative review. Sadly. I do not have the patience anymore to workaround these issues or wait for an update. Too many games release in unfinished states nowadays. Completely unacceptable. I think I am done with purchasing mobile games upfront. It’s either F2P for me, or at least free to try so I can try the game out first before making a purchase. What a saddening situation. One of the best games I've played being ported in an unfinished state by one of the most reliable publishers on mobile; very unexpected. I hope they can fix it soon, since I want you, guys, to drool over how good it is when fully playable. I can't even give it a go on mobile because my phone isn't supported, but damn that's so disheartening. (ᵒ̴̶̷᷄﹏ᵒ̴̶̷᷅) Yeah. The game is brilliant. I played it a fair bit on PC. Upto the first main story beat. Games of this genre generally don’t have much of a story. But this is special. And not just the greater plot but also the family and their relations. The characters are its real highlights. That’s why I had it preordered as soon as I saw it. And started playing as soon as it was downloaded on my phone. But as most games nowadays, even the basic standards are not met on release. Tired of tolerating that. It’s not good it’s released with issues, I guess I’ve always just tolerated it when it happens and don’t play games until they have had a few updates sometimes. But what I dislike are games like Digs Premium where it’s got bugs, gets one update and then it’s seemingly abandoned and no updates for ages. If they fix it fairly quickly I’m still happy but if it takes too long then it’s not on. But of course in an ideal world they wouldn’t release with any issues. Just confirming this is using touch controls? Because the same thing I noticed for touch controls as well. I find the first attack usually goes in another direction, and then the follow on attacks then go to the correct direction. Obviously unplayable/frustrating like that. I actually deleted the game already and might try refund. A bit over issues like that. As was already said, how the heck does this get past QA!? Yeah. The issue for me was happening with touch controls. I am done with the game too. Support couldn’t even understand the issue. And Apple says it’s not eligible for refund. So yay! This is the other side of premium gaming on mobile. Share This Page",

It’s either F2P for me, or at least free to try so I can try the game out first before making a purchase.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/article\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli id=\"post-4307248\" data-author=\"sebgo\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cdiv itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Person\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://toucharcade.com/community/threads/children-of-morta-by-playdigious.432876/members/sebgo.72299/\" data-avatarhtml=\"true\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://toucharcade.com/community/threads/children-of-morta-by-playdigious.432876/data/avatars/m/72/72299.jpg?1709454498\" width=\"96\" height=\"96\" alt=\"sebgo\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\n\n\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003carticle\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\nWhat a saddening situation. One of the best games I\u0026#39;ve played being ported in an unfinished state by one of the most reliable publishers on mobile; very unexpected. I hope they can fix it soon, since I want you, guys, to drool over how good it is when fully playable. I can\u0026#39;t even give it a go on mobile because my phone isn\u0026#39;t supported, but damn that\u0026#39;s so disheartening.\u003cp\u003e\n\n(ᵒ̴̶̷᷄﹏ᵒ̴̶̷᷅)\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/article\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli id=\"post-4307249\" data-author=\"Rocksaint\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003carticle\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\nYeah. The game is brilliant. I played it a fair bit on PC. Upto the first main story beat. Games of this genre generally don’t have much of a story. But this is special. And not just the greater plot but also the family and their relations. The characters are its real highlights.\u003cp\u003e\n\nThat’s why I had it preordered as soon as I saw it. And started playing as soon as it was downloaded on my phone. But as most games nowadays, even the basic standards are not met on release. Tired of tolerating that.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/article\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli id=\"post-4307250\" data-author=\"ste86uk\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003carticle\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\nIt’s not good it’s released with issues, I guess I’ve always just tolerated it when it happens and don’t play games until they have had a few updates sometimes. But what I dislike are games like Digs Premium where it’s got bugs, gets one update and then it’s seemingly abandoned and no updates for ages.\u003cp\u003e\n\nIf they fix it fairly quickly I’m still happy but if it takes too long then it’s not on. But of course in an ideal world they wouldn’t release with any issues.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/article\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli id=\"post-4307253\" data-author=\"Talbs\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cdiv itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Person\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://toucharcade.com/community/threads/children-of-morta-by-playdigious.432876/members/talbs.89771/\" data-avatarhtml=\"true\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://toucharcade.com/community/threads/children-of-morta-by-playdigious.432876/styles/toucharcade/xenforo/avatars/avatar_m.png\" width=\"96\" height=\"96\" alt=\"Talbs\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\n\n\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003carticle\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\nJust confirming this is using touch controls? Because the same thing I noticed for touch controls as well. I find the first attack usually goes in another direction, and then the follow on attacks then go to the correct direction.\u003cbr/\u003e\nObviously unplayable/frustrating like that.\u003cp\u003e\n\nI actually deleted the game already and might try refund. A bit over issues like that.
