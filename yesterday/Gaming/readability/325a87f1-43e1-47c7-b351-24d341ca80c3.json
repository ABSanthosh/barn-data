  "text": "Coming to PC and consoles this year. Image credit: Guard Crush Games/Supermonks/Dotemu Dotemu and Guard Crush Games, the studios behind 2020's widely acclaimed beat 'em up sequel Streets of Rage 4, are teaming up again for something a little bit different: Absolum, a fantasy themed side-scrolling brawler with rogue-like elements that's launching this year. Absolum aims to combine \"thrilling arcade beat 'em up action\" with \"intricate, refined combat\" to create what Dotemu is describing as a \"rogue 'em up\". There's talk of quests, branching pathways, NPCs, unlockable items, permanent warrior upgrades, and combinable character skills - all in a fantasy adventure channeling the spirit of classic brawlers including Golden Axe. Absolum's action plays out across Talamh, a world of wonder and cosmic horrors gripped by warfare following a cataclysmic magical event. That's where the game's four-strong band of rebels comes in, all setting out on an epic quest to oppose the Sun King Azra and liberate Talamh after they're imbued with powerful magic. Absolum - Reveal Trailer Absolum announcement trailer.Watch on YouTube All four rebels are playable (either solo or co-operatively) and feature their own unique skill set and personality, with two having been revealed so far. There's Galandra, for instance - an agile, sword-clad fighter designed to excel in close-quarters combat - while Karl is a tanklike dwarf armed with devastating punches and a rifle that can bring down opponents from afar. \"Absolum blends arcade-like melee combat with spells, counters, upgradable abilities and uniquely powerful playable fighters,\" explains Dotemu, \"hosting a grand, high-stakes quest across an array of hand-crafted stages.\" Those stages - and Absolum's striking visual style - have been brought to life by the artists and animators at animation studio Supamonks. Absolum doesn't have a release date yet, but it's coming to PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC (via Steam) sometime later this year.",
