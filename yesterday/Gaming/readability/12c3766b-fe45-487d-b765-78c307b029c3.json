  "text": "DOGWALK casts you as a bouncy, shaggy dog trying to help their child owner build a snowman as best you can. A small child is out playing on a snowy day trying to make a snowman. They’ve done a pretty good job, but they need to do some accessorizing. The snowman could use a hat, another arm, and maybe something to hold to make him complete. As the child’s faithful, energetic dog, you have to help the kid find all of this stuff on this bright, beautiful day. And maybe stop periodically to show your kid just how much you love them with a few licks on the cheek. You only have a handful of abilities in this game, but they’re more than enough to help a cute dog save the day. The dog will bark or whine to get the kid’s attention, but once the child frees your leash from the stake in the ground, you can lead or drag them around the park to give them more direct indication on where to go. Not that this little child has any choice in the matter if you decide to take them for a high-speed run around the park. The kid just does what they can to keep up as you bounce through the snow and bushes. This results in some funny interactions as the child flounders and grunts as they stumble and slide around. Depending on what kind of dog you want to be, maybe you’ll slow down and let them get up or maybe you’ll drag them the entire way. It’s always up to you. DOGWALK is a charming snapshot of a bright winter afternoon and the chaotic fun a dog and child can get up to. I just hope you don’t send the poor kid spinning around on the ice for too long. DOGWALK is available now (for free) on itch.io.
