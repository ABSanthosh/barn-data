It did sell out quickly, but it's back today at an even lower price. This is the best price we've seen on a true OLED gaming monitor, even during Black Friday or Cyber Monday. AOC, a Taiwanese brand, is one of the biggest sellers of gaming monitors globally.27\" AOC 1440p 240Hz QD-OLED Monitor for $429.1927\" AOC 1440p 240Hz QD-OLED Gaming MonitorThe AOC Q27G4ZD is a 27\" 2560x1440 or QHD resolution monitor, which offers a respectable 108ppi pixel density. It also features a 240Hz refresh rate, which should be more than enough for most FPS gamers, and it's certified G-Sync compatible. The Q27G4ZD uses a Samsung quantum dot OLED panel, which is brighter than traditional OLED panels while maintaining the same incredible black levels, color range, and near instantaneous response times that OLEDs are known for. According to the spec sheet, it is HDR True Black 400 certified and boasts a 110% DCI-P3 / 148% sRGB color range.Connectivity wise, the AW2725QF has two HDMI 2.0 ports that two DisplayPort 1.4 ports. It also has built-in speakers for the times you don't need a headset. AOC includes a 3 year warranty with a zero bright pixel guarantee.We haven't yet reviewed this monitor ourselves, so we can't yet compare it to the other best gaming monitors currently available. However, OLED is a tried and true technology that usually commands a premium price tag, and here's the best opportunity we've seen to get an OLED equipped monitor at a reasonable price.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
