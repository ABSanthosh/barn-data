  "text": "Look Outside, a mixture of survival horror and RPG, finds you exploring an apartment building filled with creative, twisted monstrosities. Some sort of bad business is going on outside of your apartment building. It’s so bad that anyone who looks outside gets turned into a mangled beast of flesh, teeth, and grasping tendrils (and much worse than that). Naturally, you’re going to take a look out the window at least once, right? I mean, the game lets you do it. You’ll quickly find out that you shouldn’t do that, but for the rest of the game, your curiosity will probably continue to get you killed. I mean, you came here to look at the amazing pixel art monsters like I did, didn’t you? The game’s halls and apartments are filled with all kinds of other people who gave in to their curiosity and looked out the window, finding themselves turned into all manner of grotesque creatures. While this is an RPG and you can grind for levels and try to get stronger, it also leans into survival horror, meaning you have limited supplies (and your things tend to break at times). So, you’ll inevitably run into something that will take your life even if you think you’re pretty tough. However, the massive monsters and disgusting beings in this game are all well-worth running into if you’re a fan of fantastic horror designs. There’s so much sickening creativity on display here that it’s totally worth losing the game a few dozen times to see what’s all lurking the halls. Look Outside is a compelling mix of RPG and horror that offers endless great monster designs for you to run into as you choose how you proceed through your unsettling time waiting for the curse to pass outside. Giving in to your own curiosity and desire to explore might get you killed a lot, but it will never result in a dull trip along the way. Look Outside is available now on Steam.
