  "text": "SummaryUnleash the Alpaca-lypse: Speedollama Launches today on Xbox.Influences and inspirations for the creation of the Llamaverse.Developer Nicola Piovesan talks process. Nicola Piovesan, Speedollama developer, getting into character After working on the pixel art for Speedollama, I now have the chance to sit down with Nicola Piovesan, the game’s designer, to ask him a few questions about the project. As part of the team, it’s interesting to hear more about his creative process, the challenges we faced, and what went into making this fast and quirky game. Let’s start from the beginning. Where did the idea for Speedollama come from? Nicola (N): Speedollama is my fourth game (fifth if you count an unfinished one), and with each new project, I aim to experiment. My previous games were mostly point-and-click adventures set in a dark, cyberpunk universe, but with this platformer, I explore something entirely different—bright, chaotic, and fun. It’s like my creative yin and yang. After working on something dramatic, I felt the need to dive into humor and vibrancy. Speedollama came from this need to create something colorful and fast-paced. And what could be more bizarre and fun than a war between llamas and alpacas? What are the game’s standout features? N: The retro-arcade feel is the first thing that hits you—from the pixel art graphics to the gameplay mechanics. But what really stands out is the speed. Speedollama is designed to be one of the fastest in its genre, especially in later stages when players unlock speed upgrades. It’s intense. Some people have compared it to Metal Slug. Does that bother you? N: I’ve seen Speedollama described as “Metal Slug with llamas,” and while that’s flattering, it’s also a bit frustrating when people imply I copied it. Sure, there are similarities—any retro, run-and-gun game will have them—but Speedollama does its own thing. It’s not just a horizontal side-scroller; it develops vertically, making it more of a platformer. Plus, it has procedurally generated levels and a “collectathon” element where players race against the clock to gather items. So, while the comparisons are inevitable, I think we’ve crafted a unique experience. Isn’t it risky to release this game an indie market saturated with so many pixelated platformers? N: Absolutely, it’s a risk. I’ll admit, I’m not great at market research or developing games with a specific audience in mind. I tend to go with my gut—if I like an idea, I’ll run with it. That said, I do listen to feedback. We released a demo about a year ago, and I took a lot of player suggestions to improve the game. Yes, the market is crowded, and pixel-art platformers are everywhere, which might make Speedollama hard to notice at first. But I believe that once people pick up a controller and feel the speed and fun, they’ll see it’s something special. How large was the team behind Speedollama? N: This is an interesting question because people often wonder if Speedollama was a solo project. The answer is both yes and no. If you define a solo project as one person doing absolutely everything, then no—it wasn’t just me. You, for instance, were the lead pixel artist, and we had a couple more pixel artists, two animators, a music composer, voice actors, and a small team of beta testers. In total, around eight or nine people contributed to the game. However, if by “solo project” you mean one person handling most of the development—coding, writing, level design, enemy AI, UI, sound, and even marketing—then yes, it was largely my work. I did everything except create the art and music, which was handled by you and other talented folks. But their contributions were crucial, especially in bringing the game’s unique, quirky visual style to life. The indie game market is a tough space, no doubt. There are tons of platformers coming out every month, and standing out is a challenge. But I’m confident that Speedollama brings something fresh to the table—it’s fast, eccentric, and a lot of fun to play. I can’t wait to see how players respond to this wild, goofy adventure. Pick up Speedollama today on Xbox. Chaosmonger Studio $8.99 $8.09 Speedollama is a fast platformer shooter that sets a new benchmark for speed in the genre. Bursting with quirky humor and vibrant pixelated carnage, this game is not for the faint of heart. Are you ready to embrace the chaos and prove your skills? Packed with hilarious splatter elements, fast-paced action, a variety of upgrades and weapons, and loads of humor, Speedollama promises to entertain gamers of all ages. The game's visuals feature pixel art to capture a retro-arcade aesthetic, reminiscent of late 80s and early 90s games. Drawing inspiration from classic titles like Metal Slug and Turrican, as well as modern hits like Broforce, Mercenary Kings, and Pizza Tower, Speedollama delivers a nostalgic yet fresh gaming experience. STORYLINE A wise old llama has enlisted a group of elite mercenaries for an almost impossible mission: to destroy the alpaca army that has waged a brutal war to exterminate the llamas and seize world domination. Equipped with a powerful tunneling machine, the llamas embark on a bizarre journey, burrowing through the earth, collecting funky substances, and battling the relentless alpaca forces along with their beastly allies.",
