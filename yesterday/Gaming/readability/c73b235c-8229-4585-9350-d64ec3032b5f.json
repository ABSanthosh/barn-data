  "text": "Tea for Sana has you trying to avoid letting on on that you’ve lost your memories while making food for people who need it. This is a story-driven adventure game that’s clearly inspired by a Slavic fantasy world. You play as an old witch known for her ability to cook meals that heal people. However, in more recent times, your memories have started to fade, leaving you unable to find your items or remember your recipes at all. You don’t want to admit that your memory has been fading or that you aren’t the witch that you once were, so instead you are just trying to fumble through life, talking to people in the area and finding objects that might jog your memory. There are some spirits who are able to help you out, although there are others who aren’t very helpful at all. This all comes to a head in Tea for Sana when your friend Sana visits but is hiding her face. You need to make a drink to help her, but cannot quite remember what her favorite is. Thankfully, everyone is patent, so you have time to exit your home and start gathering ingredients which you can then use to make different foods or drinks. Wandering around your home, you can find chestnuts, flowers, and even the coffee beans that you have been growing in your garden. You can also interact with creatures and humans nearby. The people in Tea for Sana actually have a lot of different dialogue. Talking to them once won’t get you far, so it’s worth speaking to them again, seeing what new lines of conversation appear and what they say. I found it surprising when I played the demo at Develop Reboot Blue that I needed to continue to talk to people right after speaking to them to gain more information and understand their needs. The creatures are less talkative, but still very interesting in what they need or how they speak. Tea for Sana is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can add it to your Steam Wishlist.
