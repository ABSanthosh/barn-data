  "text": "Image credit: LEVEL5 Inc Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time has had an unexpectedly strong start for a sequel to a fairly obscure 13-year Nintendo DS game. And developer Level 5 has now thanked fans for their enthusiasm, pledging to release free DLC in response to its \"global success\". The Girl Who Steals Time, for context, is a sequel to Level 5's Fantasy Life - a sort of job-focussed mash-mash of life sim and RPG - which enjoyed modest critical and commercial success when it launched for Nintendo DS back in 2012. Eurogamer's celebrated its \"abundance of features\" in our 6/10 review at the time, but noted the result was often \"less than the sum of its parts\". But in this post-Stardew Valley world - where you can't watch an indie showcase without seeing a dozen new village sims jostling for attention - the newly released Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals seems to resonated with audiences. It's garnered a positive early critical reception and even surpassed 45K concurrents on its first day on Steam (that's more than Doom: The Dark Ages managed) - and Level 5 is now celebrating its launch with news of more to come. FANTASY LIFE i: The Girl Who Steals Time - All Features at a Glance! Fantasy Life i - features trailer.Watch on YouTube \"Due to the game's global success and the warm support from players around the world,\" it wrote in a message on its website, \"we have decided to release a free DLC that includes new recipes as well as expanded content under the title 'Update the World!'.\" Level 5 hasn't shared much in the way of specifics, but it promises \"new content designed to make use of high-rarity weapons obtained from Treasure Groves and other sources\", as well as \"even more opportunities [for players] to showcase their gear\". The studio says it's working to release the DLC \"as soon as possible\", and will provide further details at a later date. It sounds like there's even more on the way too; \"We will continue to update and improve Fantasy Life i,\" it adds, \"so that players can enjoy its world more comfortably and for an even longer time.\" Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is available now on Steam, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and Switch, with a Switch 2 version coming later this year.",
