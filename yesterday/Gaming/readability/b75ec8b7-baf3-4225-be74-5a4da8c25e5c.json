The problem is that we got into kind of the peak of problems of in my career and I have to fight the urge to just veer into corporate issues that have nothing to do with telephony.  Things like that post about “the move” which was amusing, but had little to do with the topic at hand.  So now I am going to try and get back on track and wrap things up in… we’ll call it four posts.  I can do it. As I mentioned in the post about moving buildings, we were sold along the way to one of our main competitors, a company called Intervoice. We’ll get to the solutions bit Intervoice, based in Dallas, Texas, just across the street from the University of Texas at Dallas, had been in trouble for a while.  Their story arc started very much the way Edify’s did, selling both hardware and software for IVR systems.  But, while Edify quickly shed the hardware side of things… hardware is a tough business as you need a lot of working capital to keep your supply chain stocked while software, back then at least, was just disks… they doubled down on hardware and made it a core part of their business. So while we were out there letting NMS do the heavy lifting on telephone hardware, Intervoice made their own telephone cards.  That shaped the company culture dramatically and even when they had to stop manufacturing of their telephony cards… they couldn’t meet the standards for lead based solder or some such… that they kept all of their order and shipping processes as though they were still shipping hardware. To process a software update that a customer was going to download from us, so no disk involved even, I had to spend time in an arcane SAP process to create a bill of materials and get product IDs assigned and a whole bunch of stuff I am probably forgetting.  It was insane.  And it was doubly insane because they had swapped from Oracle to SAP AFTER they had ditched their hardware manufacturing and the still felt they had to replicate that entire process in the most literal fashion imaginable. That was a huge waste of time and money.  To start with, jumping from Oracle to SAP is like jumping from the frying pan into an identical frying pan.  I told a friend at Oracle about this swap and they couldn’t stop laughing as I described it to them.  Both products are equally painful, equally ugly to the poor end users who have to work with it, both as expensive, and both produce the nice reports that the VP who paid for it wants.  (This also points out who the customer is to them.  It isn’t the poor schmuck in shipping who has to wade through 50 screens to ship something.  It is the VP who signed the purchase order.  They get what they want, the actual people who put in the data get stuck with all the bad UI and half-baked work flows.) Second, they had an opportunity to create a brand new, streamlined process that did just what they needed.  But they were so hidebound in their old ways that the thought of anything new seemed to scare them.  What if they suddenly could manufacture telephone cards again?  So the replicated all the layers of control that went into tracking every resistor needed on a fab. I knew about Intervoice, or knew that we competed against them.   We had beat them on a deal with Dell at one point, a huge purchase where Dell bought a multi-year site license for our software, intending to unify their chaotic phone system.  This could have been a nightmare for us, but Dell insisted on doing everything themselves and spent the duration of the site license just screwing around with our software, trying it out, finding bugs for us, but never quite getting around to deploying it.  And then they wanted the site license renewed at half the already low low price we had given them and we said “no” and they gave up on us.  In many ways, they were the ideal customer for that era.  Gave us a bunch of money, tested our product for free, never once called us with an emergency issue in production.  They went back to Intervoice, just as Intervoice bought us, which was kind of funny as well. But the word was that Intervoice was in a death spiral.  They had to get out of the hardware manufacturing business, which meant a big effort to integrate with Dialogic, their chosen replacement hardware vendor, who were both expensive and difficult to deal with.  One thing we agreed with our co-workers in Dallas on was Dialogic making awful software and allowing only primitive levels of call control compared to NMS for us or Inervoice’s home built cards. They had jumped on board with Microsoft’s rival proposal to VoiceXML.  Called SALT, Intervoice put in the money and time to become the primary vendor for SALT platforms and training, only to have Microsoft throw in the towel and go with VXML.  I know, Microsoft screwing over its partner ecosystem?  Shocking! So Intervoice had to scramble to adopt VXML, which they had been railing against like good Microsoft lapdogs.  They had also go full on into the VXML idea, scrapping their old development platform for an extremely rudimentary VXML engine and Eclipse with plugin as their editor.  Cool and light weight I suppose, but there were 20 other companies doing that at the same time, only they were 50 person organizations that could adapt and undercut anything Intervoice did. And that was in part because Intervoice in its prime had bought some land and built their own offices, a double tower in sight of UTD as I mentioned, that became a milestone around their neck the way out dotcom bubble had been around ours.  Only we could at least move when our lease expired.  They were in a city of cheap office space paying the upkeep on a lot of space they didn’t need and hadn’t needed for years. Finally, they had adopted the ISO9000-2000 standard for software development quality.  This was to get into certain government contracts, and MAYBE it was worth it for that.  But the whole thing was a joke.  I became the site monitor for our building and had to prep and be part of ISO audits. I majored in business back in college and I had to take an organizational behavior class from a very smart profession whose name was Claudia.  Her thing was always to look at how processes were documented and to compare that do how things were actually getting done.  The official process versus the informal process.  When the actual process doesn’t match all those ISO documents, you know you’re going into some deep bullshit. When it was announced who our new lords and masters would be, we were not thrilled.  The talk about them being in a death spiral by industry analysts had been going on for a few years at that point, they prime reasons being to too much overhead, the death of their legacy product and all the maintenance revenue that went with it, and a complete lack of any viable plan going forward.  So it was clear they were grabbing hold of Edify in a last gasp effort to find a revenue stream by the expedient of buying us and forcing our customers to use their product. This failed to work in the past and would fail to work this time around, but not before the Edify product was made much worse for the effort. I will say this about the Intervoice acquisition; at least they didn’t try to woo us or blow smoke up our collective asses before the deal closed.  No, they were assholes from day one.  They had a long history of being assholes.  And when I say “they” I, as always, mean executive management.  Lots of decent people worked for Intervoice, but no good people actually ran Intervoice.  Just as an example, they had a trans employee who, on transitioning, was fired because that was just icky.  That employee sued them, in Texas, and won and got their job back along with a settlement and was still there and still doing good work despite being pretty safe after the lawsuit, and senior management was still surly about that. So a bunch of jerks, but identifiable so and not a group that had promised to be anything to us but jerks. I am more annoyed at the Edify leadership who, after getting the company our from under some very bad decisions I previously covered into a profitable state with a promise that we would be an ongoing venture, only to sell us out at the first opportunity.  Mitch and all the execs who got a big payout after selling us down the river… well, I hope they all got kidney stones or some other miserably painful old age ailment. That would be the last time I would believe any exec who said they were interested in the business.  They are only interested in maximum profit and cashing out as soon as possible.  So they sold us to the shitheels in Dallas whose executive staff couldn’t collectively pour piss out of a boot if you printed the instructions on the heel. And you may think I am biased by having to deal with them.  I mean, they had the wits to buy us, a profitable company.  And, for a while, we would remain the sole profit center for the enterprise.  But, as I mentioned in the post about the move, they also bought a complete dog of a company that made an IP contact center because… I don’t know, they weren’t making any money and had no prospects to ever do so… so promises from other execs looking to cash out? Somebody made money on that deal, but it wasn’t Intervoice. The IP call center idea wasn’t bad on its high level merits.  But execution was poor and it only got worse and worse, and I can vouch 100% for that because it became my problem.  I was thrown in to run that QA group along with the others I had. In order to control as many variables for the IP call center app as possible the team setup their own RHEL distro, so you started at bare metal and had to install the OS.  It was also designed only to work on very specific Dell hardware.  Both of these led to no end of problems.  We were not setup to manage a Linux distro and anybody who know anything about computer hardware knows that a company like Dell updates and changes everything on pretty much a 12 month cycle.  So that all had to be juggled. Meanwhile the UI was primitive.  There was a plan to have an outsource team redo it completely which was another absolute disaster as it was like a game of Telephone, where 16 people later the person implementing the spec was doing something completely at odds with what was intended. All of which could have potentially been overcome with a diligent development VP.  But we had a clown instead who would skip meeting or dial in from his bike because he had to get his exercise and give “everything is going to plan” status reports… and then a deadline would hit and he would announce that of the 89 features he had said were all on schedule, he was ready to deliver 6, but couldn’t afford the dev time to update the install guide… which, as you can image with an OS install being step one, was kind of a big deal. And all of this was piled on top of the fact that at the time most companies believed they were ready for VoIP but were, in fact, not even close, something I covered in my VoIP post. So even when this craptastic kludge could be polished up to make a sale, as they managed to do for a high profile Texas haberdasher, and even when they could get things installed, and even when they could train the customer not to press the big shiny red button that would screw up the call in progress, their network could not support the traffic.  Born to lose. Thus the whole thing was a non-stop train wreck of screw ups in front of customers and failed attempts to make things right.  A complete clown show that should have been left to wither on the vine. Hindsight, I know.  But they were a drain on everything we did, so even if Edify made money, the IP call center was pissing it away, though not as fast as the Dallas office was. This whole thing couldn’t last… and it didn’t.  Somehow, somebody in Dallas talked another company, Convergys, into buying the whole thing, something that made things worse still. Convergys, a call center company that was a spin-off of the Bell System, with all the institutional inertia that implies, decided they wanted a software division and could afford our pig in a poke. They believed all the lies/plans spun by Dallas and I guess covered up the fact that Edify was the only thing making any money reliably because they took us off the price list.  Always wise, making your one money earning software package unavailable to customers.  But they had already forced us to screw it up, so new versions were not worth buying. Then in the first quarter of 2010 there were no new sales, and none in the pipe for the next quarter, and the plan to lay us all off and send our jobs to India in the third quarter, which was already in progress, had to be sped up.  I had a hint when my boss, who worked out of an office in Florida, told me I could drop any feature I wanted so long as I got the next release out by June 30th, the end of Q2 2010. If anybody offers you that much leeway on a project, your time is up. So they came in and laid us all off at the end of April.  A few people stayed behind, though the choices were pretty mixed.  They kept probably the most competent developer on the Edify platform, but then kept the IP call center engineering VP clown.  Tough luck for them. We were all clearing out our desks, handing in our equipment, and filing for unemployment the same week the team from India was being flown in for us to train.  They did not get a lot of training.  We went out to lunch with a couple of them… nice guys… though one of them threw up in the back of my car on the way back from lunch.  There is probably a metaphor in that. All of us were cast out.  The exit package wasn’t too bad… my being promoted to M1 senior manager actually got me a considerable boost in severance…  but it was also the absolute height of the post-mortgage crisis layoffs in the valley.  Oracle had, just two weeks before, laid off literally everybody who had worked for Sun Microsystems.  Meanwhile, the HR hive mind was writing editorials in the Wall Street Journal that anybody laid off was damaged goods and should be black listed.  Add in the fact that I was now over 40… this in a valley where the leadership class is still loudly espousing a rule of never hiring anybody over 30… and things were looking pretty grim. The only upside was that things were so bad that the government was subsidizing COBRA, the health benefits package for those laid off, which meant for the briefest of times I had affordable health care in the United States of America.  The last time I had that was at Safeway in college before the union completely collapsed. Also, the valley had changed considerably in the dozen years I worked for Edify.  I came from a time when amateurs with some talent were let in the door and given responsibility.  The valley was always so short of staff that they couldn’t be too picky.  They had to take some chances. That had all changed.  The great wall of HR had been built, and the herd mentality of that group meant that they had to make up standards to prove they were helping protect the company.  I already related that whole side story about needing a native Spanish speaker for an IVR project and HR throwing out my one absolute requirement and sending me only resumes for H1-B candidates from India and China.  They all had a master’s degree in computer science… something totally unnecessary for the role I had to fill… but not a damn one of them spoke Spanish and HR absolutely would not budge on their baseline requirement and had no interest in my actual project need.  If they let me hire somebody without a master’s degree, it would prove it wasn’t actually required and then how could they tell the government they couldn’t fill positions with US workers so they could get more H1-B slots? So I spent a long, agonizing summer writing cover letters and sending out resumes, only to get almost no traction.  I got an interview with an educational toy manufacturer in Emeryville for a manager position over a group that needed to be kept motivated until they could get an outsource group stood up so they could lay off all the local staff.  Didn’t I just get through that scenario?  Also, a miserable job at the end of a daily three hour commute that had an obvious expiration date on it… like they were going to keep me after they axed the group… meant I was kind of glad I never got an offer from them, because I was desperate enough to take it. It was very much a low point in my adult life.  I’d fill out the unemployment form every week for my $450.  That was the same amount they paid me in 1997 and the same amount they would pay me again in 2021.  The minimum wage isn’t the only thing stuck in time. I would go to the classes at the outplacement service, which were helpful in getting my resume tuned up, but were otherwise not all that helpful.  When the success story of every person leading a class or seminar is that they ended up working at an outplacement service because they couldn’t keep hold of their original career path… it sends a message.  I didn’t want to work at the outplacement service.  I couldn’t be that constantly upbeat and cheerful for openers, not without a gun to my head… maybe even with a gun to my head.  So I watched the weeks go by as spring turned to summer and summer headed in to fall and pondered how big of a tax hit we would take if I cashed out my 401k to keep paying the mortgage. Then a lifeline landed in my lap.  Not the sturdiest of hawsers, but it was better than unemployment.  It would mean being a contractor again, and all the pain that went with that.  And it would be back in telephony and VoiceXML.  I could do that.

bunch of jerks, but identifiable so and not a group that had promised to be anything to us but jerks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am more annoyed at the Edify leadership who, after getting the company our from under some very bad decisions I previously covered into a profitable state with a promise that we would be an ongoing venture, only to sell us out at the first opportunity.  Mitch and all the execs who got a big payout after selling us down the river… well, I hope they all got kidney stones or some other miserably painful old age ailment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would be the last time I would believe any exec who said they were interested in the business.  They are only interested in maximum profit and cashing out as soon as possible.  So they sold us to the shitheels in Dallas whose executive staff couldn’t collectively pour piss out of a boot if you printed the instructions on the heel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you may think I am biased by having to deal with them.  I mean, they had the wits to buy us, a profitable company.  And, for a while, we would remain the sole profit center for the enterprise.  But, as I mentioned in the post about the move, they also bought a complete dog of a company that made an IP contact center because… I don’t know, they weren’t making any money and had no prospects to ever do so… so promises from other execs looking to cash out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomebody made money on that deal, but it wasn’t Intervoice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe IP call center idea wasn’t bad on its high level merits.  But execution was poor and it only got worse and worse, and I can vouch 100% for that because it became my problem.  I was thrown in to run that QA group along with the others I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to control as many variables for the IP call center app as possible the team setup their own RHEL distro, so you started at bare metal and had to install the OS.  It was also designed only to work on very specific Dell hardware.  Both of these led to no end of problems.  We were not setup to manage a Linux distro and anybody who know anything about computer hardware knows that a company like Dell updates and changes everything on pretty much a 12 month cycle.  So that all had to be juggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile the UI was primitive.  There was a plan to have an outsource team redo it completely which was another absolute disaster as it was like a game of Telephone, where 16 people later the person implementing the spec was doing something completely at odds with what was intended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of which could have potentially been overcome with a diligent development VP.  But we had a clown instead who would skip meeting or dial in from his bike because he had to get his exercise and give “everything is going to plan” status reports… and then a deadline would hit and he would announce that of the 89 features he had said were all on schedule, he was ready to deliver 6, but couldn’t afford the dev time to update the install guide… which, as you can image with an OS install being step one, was kind of a big deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd all of this was piled on top of the fact that at the time most companies believed they were ready for VoIP but were, in fact, not even close, \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2024/06/09/voice-over-ip-ascendant-in-the-enterprise/\"\u003esomething I covered in my VoIP post\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo even when this craptastic kludge could be polished up to make a sale, as they managed to do for a high profile Texas haberdasher, and even when they could get things installed, and even when they could train the customer not to press the big shiny red button that would screw up the call in progress, their network could not support the traffic.  Born to lose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus the whole thing was a non-stop train wreck of screw ups in front of customers and failed attempts to make things right.  A complete clown show that should have been left to wither on the vine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHindsight, I know.  But they were a drain on everything we did, so even if Edify made money, the IP call center was pissing it away, though not as fast as the Dallas office was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis whole thing couldn’t last… and it didn’t.  Somehow, somebody in Dallas talked another company, Convergys, into buying the whole thing, something that made things worse still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConvergys, a call center company that was a spin-off of the Bell System, with all the institutional inertia that implies, decided they wanted a software division and could afford our pig in a poke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey believed all the lies/plans spun by Dallas and I guess covered up the fact that Edify was the only thing making any money reliably because they took us off the price list.  Always wise, making your one money earning software package unavailable to customers.  But they had already forced us to screw it up, so new versions were not worth buying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen in the first quarter of 2010 there were no new sales, and none in the pipe for the next quarter, and the plan to lay us all off and send our jobs to India in the third quarter, which was already in progress, had to be sped up.  I had a hint when my boss, who worked out of an office in Florida, told me I could drop any feature I wanted so long as I got the next release out by June 30th, the end of Q2 2010.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf anybody offers you that much leeway on a project, your time is up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo they came in and laid us all off at the end of April.  A few people stayed behind, though the choices were pretty mixed.  They kept probably the most competent developer on the Edify platform, but then kept the IP call center engineering VP clown.  Tough luck for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were all clearing out our desks, handing in our equipment, and filing for unemployment the same week the team from India was being flown in for us to train.  They did not get a lot of training.  We went out to lunch with a couple of them… nice guys… though one of them threw up in the back of my car on the way back from lunch.  There is probably a metaphor in that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of us were cast out.  The exit package wasn’t too bad… my being promoted to M1 senior manager actually got me a considerable boost in severance…  but it was also the absolute height of the post-mortgage crisis layoffs in the valley.  Oracle had, just two weeks before, laid off literally everybody who had worked for Sun Microsystems.  Meanwhile, the HR hive mind was writing editorials in the Wall Street Journal that anybody laid off was damaged goods and should be black listed.  Add in the fact that I was now over 40… this in a valley where the leadership class is still loudly espousing a rule of never hiring anybody over 30… and things were looking pretty grim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only upside was that things were so bad that the government was subsidizing COBRA, the health benefits package for those laid off, which meant for the briefest of times I had affordable health care in the United States of America.  The last time I had that was at Safeway in college before the union completely collapsed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, the valley had changed considerably in the dozen years I worked for Edify.  I came from a time when amateurs with some talent were let in the door and given responsibility.  The valley was always so short of staff that they couldn’t be too picky.  They had to take some chances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had all changed.  The great wall of HR had been built, and the herd mentality of that group meant that they had to make up standards to prove they were helping protect the company.  I already \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2024/09/22/the-internship/\"\u003erelated that whole side story\u003c/a\u003e about needing a native Spanish speaker for an IVR project and HR throwing out my one absolute requirement and sending me only resumes for H1-B candidates from India and China.  They all had a master’s degree in computer science… something totally unnecessary for the role I had to fill… but not a damn one of them spoke Spanish and HR absolutely would not budge on their baseline requirement and had no interest in my actual project need.  If they let me hire somebody without a master’s degree, it would prove it wasn’t actually required and then how could they tell the government they couldn’t fill positions with US workers so they could get more H1-B slots?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I spent a long, agonizing summer writing cover letters and sending out resumes, only to get almost no traction.  I got an interview with an educational toy manufacturer in Emeryville for a manager position over a group that needed to be kept motivated until they could get an outsource group stood up so they could lay off all the local staff.  Didn’t I just get through that scenario?  Also, a miserable job at the end of a daily three hour commute that had an obvious expiration date on it… like they were going to keep me after they axed the group… meant I was kind of glad I never got an offer from them, because I was desperate enough to take it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was very much a low point in my adult life.  I’d fill out the unemployment form every week for my $450.  That was the same amount they paid me in 1997 and the same amount they would pay me again in 2021.  The minimum wage isn’t the only thing stuck in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would go to the classes at the outplacement service, which were helpful in getting my resume tuned up, but were otherwise not all that helpful.  When the success story of every person leading a class or seminar is that they ended up working at an outplacement service because they couldn’t keep hold of their original career path… it sends a message.  I didn’t want to work at the outplacement service.  I couldn’t be that constantly upbeat and cheerful for openers, not without a gun to my head… maybe even with a gun to my head.  So I watched the weeks go by as spring turned to summer and summer headed in to fall and pondered how big of a tax hit we would take if I cashed out my 401k to keep paying the mortgage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a lifeline landed in my lap.  Not the sturdiest of hawsers, but it was better than unemployment.  It would mean being a contractor again, and all the pain that went with that.  And it would be back in telephony and VoiceXML.  I could do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca
