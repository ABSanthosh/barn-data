  "text": "Irem Collection Volume 3 featuring a fantastical trio of upgraded arcade shoot ’em ups is available digitally! The latest venture between ININ, Tozai Games, and Irem is a collection of classic shooters from the late 80s and early 90s. The collection includes the 1987 coin-op classic Mr. Heli, a defining title in the cute ’em up genre with multidirectional scrolling. Also featured is 1992’s Mystic Riders, a charming shooter with dodge-rolls and boomerang attacks. Rounding it out is Dragon Breed, a fantasy take on classic titles like R-Type, starring a massive fire-breathing dragon. Once overlooked, these standout shooters are now hailed as hidden gems. Each has its own unique style and flavor, showcasing just how diverse shooters could be during this Golden Age of arcades. Like all shooters of this era, these games present a considerable challenge. After all, they were designed to steal your cash one quarter at a time and are therefore by no means easy. So, to support players who didn’t grow up battling through the unforgiving arcades of the 80s and 90s, these games now include a range of added gameplay options. Let’s explore how the designers have refreshed them for today’s generation.     A range of customization options has been included to make playing these classic joystick-and-button arcade games more intuitive and user-friendly on modern consoles. You can fully remap the controls to suit your preferences—assign the fire button to any button on your joypad, making the controls feel natural and responsive for your playstyle. This flexibility ensures that the gameplay feels smooth and approachable, whether you’re a longtime arcade enthusiast or a newbie. There are several other gameplay adjustments available, too . You can tailor the experience by adjusting the number of lives you begin with. This makes it possible for you try out at challenging sections or extend your play sessions. Difficulty levels can also be adjusted, allowing the games to be made more forgiving or more challenging. There’s even an autofire feature, which can be turned on to help you avoid wearing out your thumb during prolonged battles—especially useful in these fast-paced shoot-’em-ups where constant firing is essential. Altogether, these enhancements help preserve the feel of the original arcade titles while making them more enjoyable for today’s players. In addition, quick save/load and rewind options make the gameplay a little more accessible. If you’ve never played these games, you will certainly need these options– please believe that! Expect ambushes around every corner, and boss battles that absolutely take no prisoners! The designers have gone the extra mile to enhance the visual and competitive experience for modern players. A selection of display filters is included. These upgrade the appearance of the original graphics to better suit your needs. They range from various CRT-style effects that recreate the look of classic arcade monitors to multiple color palettes that can subtly or dramatically alter the game’s aesthetic. Whether you’re after authenticity or a fresh visual twist, there’s a setting to match your taste. On the competitive side, worldwide leaderboards have been added, giving you the chance to see how your high scores stack up against players from around the globe. Whether you’re aiming for the top spot or just looking to improve your personal best, the leaderboards add a new layer of fun and challenge, encouraging you to hone your skills and keep coming back for more. Don’t miss these hidden arcade treasures, Irem Collection Volume 3, available on Xbox One, Series X|S! Also, don’t forget that previous collections: Volume 1 and Volume 2 are also digitally available on the same Xbox consoles!
