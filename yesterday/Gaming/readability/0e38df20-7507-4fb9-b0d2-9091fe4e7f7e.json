While we knew from the first trailer that GTA 6 would feature two protagonists, it mostly set the stage for a return to Vice City. But with the newest trailer, Vice City gets a little more full thanks to a bevy of new faces.While their full roles and personalities might still be a mystery, the new trailer and the updated official GTA 6 website shares just enough that we now have a rough outline of who some of these friendly faces are. So read on for every GTA 6 character we’ve seen so far.Every Important GTA 6 Character We’ve Seen So FarJason DuvalJason Duval. Credit: Rockstar GamesThe first protagonist in our Bonnie and Clyde duo is Jason Duval, a man who’s looking for the easy life but can’t seem to catch a break. After serving time in the Army, he’s in the Leonida Keys working odd jobs for the local drug runners. The only thing keeping him going is his love for Lucia.Lucia CaminosLucia Caminos. Credit: Rockstar GamesAt the start of the trailer, we meet Lucia just as she’s released from Leonida Penitentiary, having served time after fighting for her family. We know her father taught Lucia how to fight from a young age and that their family moved to Leonida from Liberty City (GTA’s version of New York City). With Jason by her side, it seems Lucia has a plan to give both of them a new start towards a better life.Like past GTA games, GTA 6 is led by a couple of streetwise toughs hoping to find the score of a lifetime. What’s unique is that unlike the trio from GTA 5, and the lone wolves of older GTA games, Jason and Lucia seem to genuinely love each other, and that might allow them to reach new heights – or fall even harder than past main characters.Brian HederBrian Heder. Credit: Rockstar GamesBrian is Jason’s landlord and one of the aforementioned local drug runners in Leonida. By day he runs and operates Brian’s Boat Works and Marina, but this serves as a legitimate front for his drug business for which he hires Jason to act as some additional muscle. He sounds suspiciously like the actor Stephen Root, but Rockstar isn’t sharing its voice cast for GTA 6 just yet (we asked).Cal HamptonCal Hampton. Credit: Rockstar GamesJason’s friend and drinking buddy at The Rusty Anchor, Cal is described as having “casual paranoia” and seems somewhat prone to conspiracy theories… but also having a good time, so maybe it all balances out for him? If Rockstar’s penchant for American satire continues, we can expect Cal to exhibit some of the worst, if funniest, parts of Leonidian society.Boobie IkeBoobie Ike. Credit: Rockstar GamesA local Vice City legend, Boobie Ike is now a legitimate entrepreneur and business mogul, a far cry from his life on the streets. Boobie runs everything from real estate, a strip club, and even a recording studio which he is using as a launch pad for a new music empire with his associate, Dre’Quan. Keep an eye out for Only Raw Records’ first hit.Dre’Quan PriestDre'Quan Priest. Credit: Rockstar GamesLike Boobie, Dre’Quan is a businessman whose primary job is gangster and drug dealer. He’s hoping to use his partnership with Boobie Ike and the talents of his first music signing, Real Dimez, to promote himself to the Vice City elites. It remains to be seen how much of Dre’Quan’s ambitions will end up helping or hurting him in his climb up the power ladder.Real DimezReal Dimez. Credit: Rockstar GamesMusical duo Real Dimez comprises Bae-Luxe and Roxy, high school friends who turned their street toughness into a hip-hop and social media career. They’ve signed on with Dre’Quan Priest and Boobie Ike to capitalize on the success of their first hit, DWNPLY, to become Only Raw Records’ breakout stars.Raul BautistaRaul Bautista. Credit: Rockstar GamesIt wouldn’t be Grand Theft Auto without a few criminal masterminds, and Vice City’s got theirs with Raul Bautista. A veteran bank robber, his tendency to up the stakes during a heist means that his crew often has to deal with more than they planned for. Maybe one of his best-laid plans will be something Jason and Lucia sign on for to get their big break?And More (Various Gangsters, Cop in Body Armor, Influencers)Leonida Man and Woman. Credit: Rockstar GamesThere are plenty of faces that get a brief appearance in the trailer who aren't named. From various gangsters who Lucia and Jason seem to have run-ins with, to, of course, cops looking to bring down Vice City's criminals. And in between are all manner of partying influences, gun store owners, and other Leonida denizens.These are the main characters we know about so far in GTA 6. Has anyone caught your eye yet? How do you think the two protagonists will stack up to past GTA anti-heroes? Let us know in the comments, and for more on GTA 6, check out our breakdown of the newest trailer.",
