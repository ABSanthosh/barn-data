  "text": "We are now well into the middle campaign doldrums where the initial days of big numbers are well in the rear view mirror and the last minute frenzy is still many days away. Stars Reach You can see over at Kicktraq the daily activity has dropped off with the initial excitement about the campaign. Daily numbers through March 11 There was even a negative day, a day where the campaign ended $91 poorer that the start of the day, no doubt due to some big backer getting cold feet.  That happens when there isn’t a lot of follow up on the opening of the campaign. At the start of this week the team set out to shore up what I suspected might be an issue back before the campaign started, which was the actual number of people interested in the project. Before the campaign kicked off the follower count had passed the 8K mark.  But followers are not backers and this is a situation where both quality and quantity matter.  As I pointed out in a pre-campaign post the number of backers they had was about half the total number of people who pledged for Camelot Unchained or Crowfall, about a third of the number who bought in on Shroud of the Avatar, and maybe a fifth of the count that pledged for Star Citizen, all of which made it to about the two million dollar mark. So if you want two million dollars, you seem to need at least15K backers at a minimum, and maybe as many as 35K backers, for this sort of project. The current backer count is below 3.8K as I write this and has been going up about 50-70 per day.  Assuming consistent mid-campaign velocity and a big close in the final 48 hours, the whole thing hits maybe 8K backers, which might get the final count to a million dollars, a total my guts says is the lowest value at which the venture can be considered a complete success. The team, however, appears to have recognized the deficiency in the backer count and has added a new challenge to the campaign. Totally not playing the Star Wars card here That’s right, if the campaign reaches 5,000 backers, then we’ll get the Princess Leia cinnamon roll bun hairstyle an option. I think that style is supposed to be called “star puffs” or some such in Star Wars cannon, but since Hardware Wars featured a stand-in wearing literal pastry twists on the side of her head, the food metaphor has stuck for good.  (Also, you can watch Hardware Wars here.  Great stuff back in 1977.) This strikes me as yet another nod, wink, and wild hand gesture towards old school SWG players who have been gleefully declaring that Stars Reach will simply be a re-roll of SWG, encouraging them in their belief.  Sure, fan service works, but the idea that such a venture would be a path to success brings a quote from Prizzi’s Honor about the state of Marxie Heller to mind… and that maybe actively encouraging the idea that it is the plan might not be the wisest course. But I am also not exactly confident in the relationship between these sorts of stretch goals and people pledging to a project.  Maybe you have to make unstated promises to get people to pony up. And the team has been active doing Twitch streams and play tests and getting mentions at all the usual online publications.  All of that, however, seems to be aimed at the already installed base.  It doesn’t seem to be leaking out to the wider gaming media very well.  But maybe Raph has got some “tell all” attention grabbing interview topics coming up that will get some more attention. Meanwhile, on the installed base front, it seems likely that we’ll get past the 5K backer mark regardless given even the current level of new backers we’re seeing daily.  And we have been told that we’re getting all the stretch goals no matter what in any case, it being just a matter of them landing before or after the official launch.  So does it matter?  Does anything matter? I am no expert on running a Kickstarter campaign, and it has certainly more difficult in 2025 for an MMO to run such a campaign given the ripe history of betrayal of the last decade, but I once again feel like any sense of tension is missing from the campaign.  When you fund in an hour and we’re going to get everything listed anyway, it does take the edge off of things a bit. They at least attempted to briefly address the whole “what about space travel?” aspect of things that has been pretty much a black hole up to that point.  They put out a video, a very small section of which attempts to address this very big part of the game about which we know almost nothing so far. There isn’t a lot there, but it is something!  We got to see a years old prototype. That is more than nothing, right?  Right? Anyway, I found that less than satisfying.  The campaign is apparently just going to rely on vision statements from Raph to fill in the difference between what is in the pre-alpha and the goal of the project. I’m sure we’ll get our hair style, I’m just not sure if that is the draw they think it is.  Spaceships will just have to wait until later.
