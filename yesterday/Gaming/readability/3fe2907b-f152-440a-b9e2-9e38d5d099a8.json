Itâ€™s just a list of more or less random questions Iâ€™ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What would you rather do on a rainy day: go to the movies with a friend, cozy up at home with a good book and a cup of tea, or go on an adventurous and fun (and very wet) hike? Right now movies with a friend sounds like it would be fun! Of course weâ€™d have to have all the snacks â€“ popcorn, M\u0026Ms and bubbly water. 2. What game show would you absolutely dominate: Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy or The Price Is Right? Iâ€™d have the best chances at The Price Is Right. Canâ€™t say Iâ€™d dominate it, though. Hahaha! 3. Do you wear more makeup now or less makeup than you did a year ago?

Do you wear more makeup now or less makeup than you did a year ago? I wear a little less these days, but thatâ€™s mostly because of time constraints. I miss having a good 15 or 20 minutes to paint my face. Now I just kinda slap it on and hope for the best. 4. Howâ€™s your mental health these days? I feel steadier than Iâ€™ve felt in a while, and I think Iâ€™m finally reaching the point where I can push myself to do a little more. Last year really kicked my butt (long story short, I had a health scare, and now things are better), and itâ€™s been taking a long time to recover from living with that fear for over a year. 5. â€˜80s colorful mascara or â€˜80s style bold blush? Um, both? Theyâ€™re both so fun. I obvs wouldnâ€™t rock it to work. Well, maybe I would. ðŸ™‚ Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S.
