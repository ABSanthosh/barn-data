Sean Patrick Thomas, who portrays Polarity, has been promoted to series regular for the upcoming season.Here’s the official blurb on Season 2:In Season 2, school is back in session. As the rest of America adjusts to Homelander's iron fist, back at Godolkin University, the mysterious new Dean preaches a curriculum that promises to make students more powerful than ever. Cate and Sam are celebrated heroes, while Marie, Jordan, and Emma reluctantly return to college, burdened by months of trauma and loss. But parties and classes are hard to care about with war brewing between Humans and Supes, both on and off campus. The gang learns of a secret program that goes back to the founding of Godolkin University that may have larger implications than they realize. And, somehow, Marie is a part of it.Last year, Gen V executive producer Eric Kripke revealed how the show would handle Andre Anderson's sudden absence following the death of actor Chance Perdomo. Kripke revealed that Perdomo's character will also pass away on screen at the beginning of the season, with no intentions of recasting the character and recrafted storylines in Season 2 to reflect Anderson's absence.For more, check out our breakdown of the Season 1 finale for Gen V. As for The Boys, the fifth and final season is in the works. Meanwhile, The Boys is getting a Soldier Boy and Stormfront prequel series called Vought Rising.Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
