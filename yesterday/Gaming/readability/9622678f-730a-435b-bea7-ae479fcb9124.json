  "text": "A studio only gets to launch its very first game once! Everyone here at Dreamlit Games is incredibly excited to debut our upcoming open-world fantasy builder, Towers of Aghasba, which launches into Early Access on November 19. We can’t wait for you to experience this fantastical world as you design your island with bustling settlements and nurture thriving ecosystems while fighting off the withered invasion. This project is an ambitious open-world sandbox developed by a small team, with core mechanics intended to let players shape their island however they like. It’s also one of the first in-development early access titles coming to PS5. By launching into early access, we can involve our community in the development process, allowing us to better balance, polish, and iterate on these core components. This allows us to introduce new content and features based directly on your feedback. You can still count on a fun, fantastical experience, with lots of content to explore right from the start of our Early Acess journey— but we’ll be adding additional polish and updates in the weeks ahead. Here’s a roadmap of what to expect from Towers of Aghasba at launch— and throughout early access:  Launch content The initial launch of Towers of Aghasba is already brimming with content, deep gameplay systems, a compelling narrative, and a vast world to explore. We release with: Six regions to explore Exploration across vast open-world lands—climbing, gliding, and riding mounts Ruins and relics to discover, unlocking ancient knowledge Leisure activities (eg. fishing!) Three types of settlements to build, design, and decorate Three types of ecosystems to grow 50+ unique creatures 150+ decorations to craft Single-player and co-op gameplay Invite up to three friends to your island to build up your settlements, tend to your ecosystems, take on challenging withered foes, and discover secrets across the world Post-launch roadmap As with any early access title, the launch is just the beginning. We have plenty in store for the weeks and months following the release, from introducing new systems while expanding existing ones, new quests and narratives, new regions to explore, and more. Q4 2024 Post-launch support Quality of life updates Polish and fixes Q1 2025 New regions to unlock and explore New quest lines A fresh cast of characters Time of day-related gameplay Offline play mode Expanded glider traversal mechanics Photo Mode Player Emotes Q2 2025 New mounts and mount management system Expanding multiplayer activities and experiences Crossplay Player character customization Improved Townfolk AI Improved Shimudex functionality Q3 2025 New regions unlocked New withered quest lines and characters Giant withered demon combat Cold environmental effects New creatures Creature relationship systems Q4 2025 New biome type–shallow water New ecosystem type–water ecosystem New village type–fishing village New creatures New foliages New quest lines and characters Q1 2026 New regions unlocked Hot environmental effects New creatures Town happiness system Building customization Q2 2026 Increased Tower levels New major questlines Apart from all these exciting and ambitious plans for the road ahead, an important aspect in guiding the development of Towers of Aghasba through early access is you.  We feel it’s important to have the community involved in the development of our game to provide the best experience possible. Your feedback and suggestions are integral in the decisions we make and we hope to expand our roadmap to accommodate our player community’s requests. Let’s build an incredible, unique, ambitious, and special game together. You can pre-order the game now, and dive into the adventure with us next week when Towers of Aghasba launches into Early Access on November 19 on PS5. Trending Stories",
