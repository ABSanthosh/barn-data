If it’s all working out to plan, then I’ll be asleep by 9:30. Typically, though, I’m asleep between 10-11. And if I’ve got insomnia, then I’ll see you at the witching hour, ha! 2. Last photo you took? Connor and I were at Nordstrom Rack yesterday to look for a dress for the father-daughter dance, and we saw a very colorful men’s t-shirt with a swimming white tiger swimming. It had sequins on it, too! I couldn’t help but take a picture of it because it make me chuckle. 3. What’s your scent of the day? Wearing an old fave today, Dolce \u0026 Gabanna The One. 4.

Are you a person who likes to snack throughout the day? Not really; my body wants to eat three meals. The only thing, though, is when I get hungry, it hits REALLY hard, so I’ve been trying to mitigate that by eating snacks at 10 in the morning and 3 in the afternoon. So I guess I’m trying to become a snacker? 5. Pick one: try a new dish or stick to something you know you like? Try a new dish! Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S.
