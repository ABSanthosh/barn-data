The 128GB model is $269.99 after a $30 off discount. and the 256GB is $349.99 after a $50 off instant discount. These discounts are honored at major retailers including Amazon, Target, and Walmart. The Meta Quest 3S is widely considered the best value in VR gaming. Not only is it priced hundreds less compared to most other competitors (including Meta's own Quest3), it's also a standalone untethered gaming system that doesn't require a PC or PlayStation 5 to run,,To sweeten the pot even more, every Quest 3S purchase includes a copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow VR game and a three-month trial of Meta Quest+. In IGN's 8/10 review, Dan Stapleton wrote that \"Batman: Arkham Shadow makes most of the Arkham series' defining gameplay work respectably well in VR, and its mystery story pays off.\"Meta Quest 3S VR Headset with Batman: Arkham ShadowMeta Quest 3S 256GB VR HeadsetMeta Quest 3S 128GB VR HeadsetThe Quest 3S is an improvement over the original Quest 2 in every way and, amazingly, without a price increase. It also adopts many of the same features of the more expensive Quest 3, like the new and improved Touch controllers, the upgraded SnapDragon APU, and support for full color AR passthrough. In IGN's 9/10 Quest 3S review, Gabriel Moss wrote that \"raw processing power, full-color passthrough, and snappy Touch Plus controllers make the Quest 3S a fantastic standalone VR headset that also brings entry-level mixed-reality gaming to the masses for – arguably – the very first time.What really sets this deal above all other VR deals is that the Meta Quest 3S can be played completely untethered. That means you can play games like Beat Saber or Pistol Whip without having to own a powerful gaming PC or a PlayStation 5 console. Try to find another standalone VR headset at this price and you'll come up empty.How Is the Quest 3S Different from the Quest 3?Even at retail price, the Quest 3S comes in at $200, or 40% cheaper than the $500 Quest 3. Obviously, some compromises were made to get the 3S to its competitive price point. The spec comparisons are listed below:Quest 3S vs. Quest 3 SimilaritiesSnapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processorTouch Plus controllers120Hz refresh rateMixed reality passthrough (same cameras, different layout)Quest 3S vs. Quest 3 DifferencesLower per-eye resolution (1832x1920 vs 2064×2208)Fresnel lens vs. pancake lensLower FOV (96°/90° vs 104°/96°)Smaller storage capacity (128GB vs 512GB)Longer battery life (2.5hrs vs 2.2hrs)For the price, the Quest 3S is a better value than the Quest 3, and the best choice for gamers who are just starting out in the world of VR and want to test the waters. It is hands down a major improvement over the Quest 2 that it replaces.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
