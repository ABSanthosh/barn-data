  "description": "Do you want to hunt down all targets for The Butterfly Collector in Assassin's Creed Shadows? These women have been kidnapping children in the city of Osaka. But, before you can locate them, you must first gather a few items. Only then will their locations be revealed.Where to find all targets for The Butterfly Collector in Assassin's Creed Shadows - The Butterfly Collector quest guideThe Butterfly Collector might be a side quest, but it's certainly a big one that's more involved than most other optional tasks in the game. Here's a quick summary:You can start the quest by talking to an NPC known as the Gamemaker. She's in Katano in the Izumi Settsu region. She's right next to the ornament vendor, who's between Katano Castle and Katano Oil Trading.The Gamemaker wants you to find several origami items for her. We discuss these further in our Origami Butterflies guide.There are 10 Origami Butterflies, and some of these are actually letters addressed to the other kidnappers. While you do receive clues, we recommend acquiring all 10 items first before searching for your targets. Map of The Butterfly Collector targetsThe map above shows the locations of the Assassin's Creed Shadows Butterfly Collector targets. As you can see, there are four targets with their own mini-quest chains that lead to other areas of Osaka:Mucho: Starts with Find the ChildShucho: Starts with The One That Got AwayRicho: Starts with All Will Be WellKacho: Leads to Paper Trail and Chrysalis - You need to eliminate the first three targets before the objectives to find Kacho appear. Mucho's location: Find the ChildMucho is the easiest one to deal with among all the Assassin's Creed Shadows Butterfly Collector targets. Simply head to Kojo Ruins, which is west of the Temple of Osaka. You should see a woman (Mucho) next to a little boy. As you approach, Mucho will run away. You can either assassinate her if she hasn't been alerted yet, or you can strike her down in combat. Do watch out for other guards that are nearby.Once Mucho has been taken care of, talk to the child. Hold the button to auto-follow so you can accompany the boy to his father. Shucho's location: The One That Got AwayTo find Shucho, you need to go to the Fisherman's District near a yard where you found the Pink Origami Butterfly from earlier. There, you'll spot a child who's crying. Talk to her to learn that the kidnapper is nearby. Follow the narrow street to the east and keep the aim button held down. The glowing blue marker should reveal Shucho. Richo's location: All Will Be WellThis particular target, Richo, requires a bit of a trek:All Will Be Well - Head north of the gear vendor/kakurega until you arrive at a yard with a ruined well. Wait a while until you hear two workers talking about a bamboo grove.Forest Fugitive - Make your way to the bamboo grove north of Noda Village. As you approach the cabin, Naoe will remark about how that might be the perfect spot where someone would hide a kidnapped child.Eliminate Richo as you see fit. Then, accompany the girl until she reaches her mom near the outskirts of the city. Kacho's location: Paper Trail and ChrysalisNow that you've taken out the three initial Butterfly Collector targets in Assassin's Creed Shadows, it's time to finish off their boss, Kacho. There are a few tasks that you need to tackle first:Paper Trail - Go to the Temple of Osaka and look for a big tree along the narrow street to the north. Hold down the aim button to see the blue outline denoting the paper merchant's location.Chrysalis - Head to the Fishermen's District just a stone's throw away. A small hut in the yard has a note that you can read.Once both mini-quests are done, you'll learn that Kacho is in Nishinomaru Garden, which is just west of Osaka Castle. This is a restricted area, so try to avoid the guards as much as possible. Upon reaching Kacho, a cutscene will trigger, and you'll have to fight her normally. Should you spare or kill the Gamemaker?With Kacho's dying breath, she mentions that there's one more member of the group. It's none other than the person who gave you this quest all the way back in Katano. Now, it's time to decide if you should spare or kill the Gamemaker in Assassin's Creed Shadows. You can also give her a fitting name, though it won't have any bearing on how the quest is concluded.That's everything you need to know about how to complete The Butterfly Collector in Assassin's Creed Shadows. Here are all the rewards that you can obtain as part of this entire arc:Mucho - Hidden Pleat (uncommon tanto).Richo - The Dog-Ear (uncommon tanto).Richo's kidnapping victim - Trinket of Childlike Bravery (accessory).Shucho - Ink Spiller (rare tanto)Kacho - Note that she only drops 295x mon.Gamemaker: Ebisu's Gamble (common bow) - Drops whether you kill or spare her.Butterfly of Benevolence trinket (accessory) - Drops only if you spare her.Do you need more help as you continue your adventure throughout Sengoku Jidai era Japan? We've got you covered, so just take a look at our Assassin's Creed Shadows guides hub.",
