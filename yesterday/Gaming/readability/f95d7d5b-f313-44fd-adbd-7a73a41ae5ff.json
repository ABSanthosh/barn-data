The EVE Online 2025 Roadmap And, while it is being billed as an update to the Revenant winter expansion of last year, a lot of what is going on in it is much more ongoing fixes for the Equinox update from June of 2024, at least on the null sec side of the equation.  CCP didn’t really have a good plan last June and have been trying to react to figuring out the bad parts of it as they have gone along. Being a bit detached from the game at the moment, there are huge swathes of the update about which I find it difficult to form an opinion.  Still, some of it seems good.  To start with, we got an update to Planetary Management that people have been asking for on r/eve for ages: It’s now possible to restart extractors for a planet from the Planetary Industry window. So now you don’t have to open up every planet and restart each extractor one at a time.  Excellent.  You still do it a planet at a time, but that makes sense I guess. The PI for my high sec alt… don’t gank him When I was running two accounts I used to try to time my end of cycle to an hour of the day when I would likely have free time to go in and update things.  Now it should be easier.  Of course, once we get used to it the fact that it takes the button some time to respond and that you can’t just click all the buttons but have to wait between each click will become a meme… but that is just how we are. They also got PI templates going and have some improvements.  Too late for me.  Once I have planets setup, I don’t change them.  But if I ever have to start from scratch again I am covered I guess. I am also feeling pretty good about the Ansiblex changes… especially the name change.  Too many FCs will say “warp to the gate” in a system where there is an Ansiblex.  Calling them Ansiblex Jump Bridges gives some differentiation . It’s no longer possible to use an Ansiblex while warp disrupted or inside a bubble. Ansiblex Jump Gates have been renamed to Ansiblex Jump Bridges for more clarity on not being able to use them while warp disrupted anymore. Reduced the Radius attribute on the Ansiblex Jump Bridge from 13,000m to 7,000m. This will mean that it now takes up much less volume/area in space and will be easier to camp with warp disruptors and bubbles. Ansiblex Bridges no longer auto-repair, no longer have a damage cap and now use the same reinforcement flow as Metenox Moon Drills. Ansiblex HP values and resistances have been rebalanced following this change, to provide an increase to their total EHP while giving them higher resistances and lower flat HP to make them easier to remote repair for logistics pilots. Shield HP and Armor reduced from 750,000 HP to 500,000 HP. (Note: These are increased by 4x when it is high power). Shield and Armor Resistances increased from 20% to 75%. Structure Hitpoints increased from 3,000,000 HP to 12,000,000 HP. Ansiblex Bridges can no longer be placed closer than 100,000km to stargates. Existing Ansiblex Bridges will be grandfathered into their current locations, but once destroyed, they will need to be placed at least 100,000km away from the nearest stargate to be replaced. This all make the Ansiblex much more like the POS jump bridges of old, which they were put into the game to replace.  I was even on the inaugural Imperium Ansiblex repair fleet where we undocked a nearly full fleet of Basilisks and repaired an Ansiblex in 27 seconds. Repairing the Ansiblex in UALX-3 This will let people mess with power projection, something a few people have been complaining about forever.  Of course, this isn’t enough for them, they want jump bridges deleted… but that was the case back when they were POS jump bridges. Then there was the addition of tier 3 mining sovereignty upgrades.  I don’t mine nor do I know how the resource budget works for the alliance under Equinox sovereignty, but the fact that we had 25 of the T3 upgrades in operation by the time the weekly fireside arrived on Saturday seems to indicate that they were not too costly.  Not for a big alliance at least. Will this address the all time high where the mineral price index stands?  Maybe. February 2025 – Economic Indices since 2018 CCP Okami blamed ratting for some of the spike… apparently even with prices at an all time high it was felt that ratting was too lucrative, so NPC bounties were hit with a nerf.  There was no mention of the fact that the bounty modifiers had been broken for a couple of months so were artificially high until late February perhaps being an influence on ratting numbers, but CCP will be CCP.  They can’t just boost one thing, something else needs to be nerfed to maintain balance in universe. Those are kind of the big things for me.  But they did some other things as well, a few of which I will mention. They went our of their way to normalize warp speeds, so now there are only 7 default warp speeds rather than 13 or some such.  I am not sure warp speed differentials was a huge burning issue that was breaking the game.  This sound more like it was bugging somebody that things didn’t line up and now they want to take a victory lap by framing this as better.  Is it? Heavy Interdiction cruisers can now mount a standard cyno module.  I guess that adds some flexibility if you don’t have a force recon handy. They did some work to reduce the build price of capital ships and T1 battleships, which is just another attempt to unfuck the things they fucked up so badly back in 2021.  You don’t get a standing ovation for fixing a problem you caused Jimmy Neutron.  CCP wants big space battles… but also hates groups that have the resources to make them happen.  Always has and always will I suspect. Filaments are no longer a “get out of jail free” card.  They have a spool up timer and leave a probable signature while spooling up.  That is a reasonable change. Then there is this tidbit: Sales Tax has been increased from 4% to 7.5% I am not sure what problem that is solving but, as with tariffs, taxes are supposed to be applied to disincentivize something.  So, the market?  We don’t like the market? Then there is a whole section on “little things” that kind of amuses me Show number of skill points in queue​. Showcases how many skill injectors may be needed​. I mean, you can see they want to sell skill points.  Also, since skill injectors vary in effect depending on how many skill points you have total, you still have to do a calculation.  Why not just put the number of large or small skill injectors needed in there too? How long is my queue? That kvetch aside, I generally favor more info, so a decent change. Added state icons to drones in drone window​. Increased the readability of drone states in the drone window​. You can avoid this by using compact mode in the drone window.  I have everything in compact mode because I don’t need to see the icons, I can read the text. Market orders in the Market window are default ordered by: Sell orders are lowest to highest. Buy order are highest to lowest. I’ll have to check, but I guess this is fine if I have some other sort set and it defaults to these if I open the window again. Make double-clicking in Orders History bring up market details. Sounds good I guess. You can now pin stations to the top of your personal assets window. It is also possible to hide assets. Not sure why, but just because I don’t get it doesn’t mean its bad. You can now jump through Ansiblex’s via the radial menu. I wish I could turn off the radial menu, but that might just be me.  Otherwise, good for you radial menu lovers. Added the ability to open multiple fixed item crates. These are crates that always contain the same items and don’t have random loot. A welcome relief to having to open a bazillion similar crates.  The whole analogy with unwrapping collectable card game foil packets was always spurious… also, I hate doing that as well. Buy Orders will now always buy items from the market at the lowest possible value sale orders first at those prices, instead of always buying everything at the buy order price even when there are already existing valid sell orders at a lower price. For example, there might be 3 sell orders for a unit of Tritanium in a station, 1 for 6 isk, 1 for 8 isk, and 1 for 10 isk. You setup a buy order in that station for several units at 10 ISK. Previously, you would have bought all 3 units of tritanium from the 3 sell orders for the buy order price of 10 ISK after setting up the order. You will now, pay 6 ISK for the 1st, 8 ISK for the 2nd, and then 10 ISK only for the last unit and any units after that, that players sell to you. I am actually against this one.  If I am filling your buy order I should get what you offered.  Buy orders are the outlier in this equation, in case you want to flip that argument on its head.  Also, this benefits a few market speculators at the expense of most players.  I feel like doing that was a waste of developer time that could have been spent… giving me a checkbox to turn off the radial menu so it never pops up inadvertently again. Anyway, that is all I am in a mood to mention.  There was more, and more details about what I mentioned, but you can find that all in the links below.

2018\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCCP Okami blamed ratting for some of the spike… apparently even with prices at an all time high it was felt that ratting was too lucrative, so NPC bounties were hit with a nerf.  There was no mention of the fact that the bounty modifiers had been broken for a couple of months so were artificially high until late February perhaps being an influence on ratting numbers, but CCP will be CCP.  They can’t just boost one thing, something else needs to be nerfed to maintain balance in universe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose are kind of the big things for me.  But they did some other things as well, a few of which I will mention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went our of their way to normalize warp speeds, so now there are only 7 default warp speeds rather than 13 or some such.  I am not sure warp speed differentials was a huge burning issue that was breaking the game.  This sound more like it was bugging somebody that things didn’t line up and now they want to take a victory lap by framing this as better.  Is it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeavy Interdiction cruisers can now mount a standard cyno module.  I guess that adds some flexibility if you don’t have a force recon handy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey did some work to reduce the build price of capital ships and T1 battleships, which is just another attempt to unfuck the things they fucked up so badly back in 2021.  You don’t get a standing ovation for fixing a problem you caused Jimmy Neutron.  CCP wants big space battles… but also hates groups that have the resources to make them happen.  Always has and always will I suspect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFilaments are no longer a “get out of jail free” card.  They have a spool up timer and leave a probable signature while spooling up.  That is a reasonable change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there is this tidbit:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSales Tax has been increased from 4% to 7.5%\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not sure what problem that is solving but, as with tariffs, taxes are supposed to be applied to disincentivize something.  So, the market?  We don’t like the market?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there is a whole section on “little things” that kind of amuses me\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eShow number of skill

they want to sell skill points.  Also, since skill injectors vary in effect depending on how many skill points you have total, you still have to do a calculation.  Why not just put the number of large or small skill injectors needed in there too?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_133298\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca
