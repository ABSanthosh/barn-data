This group was to be called the Reavers. Reavers forum bee In my head I seem to recall the name Reavers being a placeholder (and a Firefly reference because we’re all nerds on this bus) and then nothing better came up, so it stuck.  But that was also ten years ago and I struggle to remember what I had for lunch yesterday, so maybe it was the name was set at the time?  Also, I had not heard of Asher up to that point.  But I had been hanging around the Freedom Squad ops as they were trying to drum up more people to participate. I had to actually borrow much of the above text from past write ups as the memories of the time have faded.  And since I started down that path, I might as well continue.  Better to repeat my thoughts from 2015 where the details were fresh in my head than try to piece together memories now ten years in the past. In a null sec of far flung rental empires that existed at that time, the Phoebe expansion was set to curtail the ability to bridge, jump, or otherwise move fleets rapidly across many light years. In a war, a group with a large area to defend would have to commit to the front lines of any conflict. In this situation, Reavers were to go deep into the enemy’s territory, far behind the front lines, and cause havoc by blowing up SBUs, reinforcing towers, siphoning mining operations, setting timers, disabling station services, snapping jump bridge connections, and generally making such a nusance of ourselves. The enemy would thus be forced to decide between fighting on the front lines or putting out fires deep in their rear areas. The Reavers themselves would arrive via wormholes, carrying all they needed in their Ishtars. They would live in, and log out from, safe spots and refit via mobile depots. (I had to check, but mobile depots arrived in 2013.  They were required for those Asher fits.) They would, scout, hit targets of opportunity, set timers, call in coalition support for particularly juicy targets (like capital ship assembly arrays), but otherwise safe up, cloak up, and log off should the enemy show up in force. Our existence was to be denied, we were never to speak in local, we were to be a rumor and a story to scare renters with when it was dark out. And such was our modus operandi for a while, so long as the large rental empires remained.  You can read about the state of the then CFC (The Imperium was not declared until April of 2015) and null sec in that State of the Goonion link, which goes to the Internet Archive in the hope that the link won’t decay like the rest of my links when The Mittani dot com turned into Imperium News. (Mentioned in that was the attempt to start a casino of our own. Also, we were trying to have a rental empire for a bit.) In that brief moment of time when the SIG was being founded enrollment was briefly open to all who applied and I wandered in and signed up, never having joined a SIG or squad in my two years in the CFC.  I was strictly a main fleet F1 monkey up to that point.  Granted, I am not much more than that now, but I know how to use a mobile depot to refit in space and can make bookmarks for safes and a few other space boy scout skills. That first year of Reavers was very active.  I wrote about our deployments, though I was, as I remain, sensitive about revealing what might be useful intel.  It takes a bit of hubris to believe somebody was reading these reports or that I knew enough to pass along any intel of use, but still I took some care, usually writing about things some time after the fact. This is what I recorded for that first year. Notes from an Undisclosed Location in the Insmother Region – Oct. 23, 2014 Home from Camping in Insmother – Oct. 27, 2014 Song of the South – Oct. 31, 2014 Feythabolis and the Fight at ZS-2LT – Nov. 3, 2014 Meanwhile, Somewhere in Omist… – Nov. 7, 2014 Returned from Omist – Nov. 17, 2014 Picking the Right Fleet – NCDot Supers Down in Querious – Dec. 5, 2014 Back from Operations in Querious – Dec. 17, 2014 When You Know You Are Making a Difference (The Willy Nilly email) – Feb. 8, 2015 The Same Old Rumor of War – Mar. 16, 2015 Fountain, Wartime Jabber, and Points South – Mar. 23, 2015 Punitive Expedition to Delve – Mar. 27, 2015 Tales from the War in Delve and Querious – Apr. 6, 2015 Reavers Represent (Jacket Pals begin) – Apr. 8, 2015 Back and Forth Across Fountain and Delve as Dominion Fades – Apr. 13, 2015 In Your Systems Taking Your Space – Apr. 20, 2015 Doing the Null Sec Shuffle – May 20, 2015 A Feast for Ravens – May 27, 2015 The Revenant Kill in JU-0WQ (Reavers in Ravens) – Jun. 1, 2015 Entosis Link Modules in Action in Querious – Jun. 3, 2015 Dominion Sovereignty Quirks and the Bloody Defense of ED-9LT – Jun. 8, 2015 Departures from Querious for Points North – Jun. 9, 2015 Learning to do the Fozzie Sov Shuffle – Jul. 17, 2015 Towers Still Give Kill Mails – Sep. 14, 2015 The Unusual Scent of Victory in Period Basis – Sep. 18, 2015 Throwing Claws Around Cloud Ring – Sep. 24, 2015 While We Were Away – Oct. 28, 2015 That is pretty much peak Reavers.  We were let loose and running around hostile space being a nuisance and blowing stuff up.  Key items of “Reavers lore” like the “willy nilly” email from Lady Scarlet and the defense of the station at ED-9LT took place that year.  It was an age of legends. That was also the last bit of null sec before Aegis/Fozzie sov was implemented.  It was a strange state.  There was a point when you could shoot station services and disable things like the clone bay.  But entosis modules and Upwell structures were on their way.  And the Casino War. I still need to write a consolidated post about the Casino War to bring together all I wrote about it during and after.  I need to do that for a few conflicts I suppose.  I can’t leave it at just the Fountain War… Andrew Groen has been talking about writing another Empires of EVE book to round things out as a trilogy and I link to a lot of source material. That made the second years somewhat quiet, with only these posts: Wicked Creek Without a Paddle – November 12, 2015 Home from Wicked Creek – November 18, 2015 Typhoons and Jackdaws on a Saturday Afternoon – January 18. 2016 Reavers Move South Again – January 25, 2016 Last Flight of the Raven – February 12, 2016 The Defense of the 60M-TG Station and Our Return to the North – February 14, 2016 Casino War happens and we end up in Delve Delve Conquest Complete – September 14, 2016 Scenes from an Astrahus Kill in Querious – October 11, 2016 Barghests Down in Querious Astrahus Fight – October 24, 2016 In year three we were back to our usual business, including the camp of the traitors of Circle of Two in Impass.  We were later told that we had a spy who was going to betray them and we were there to cover operations should they proceed, but that didn’t come to pass until later.  We came home and had to await Judgement Day for CO2. Year four found us working out of an NPC station in Pure Blind for what would later become a full scale war.  I was actually tired of EVE Online at that time and was considering taking a break.  But then the whole thing developed of the months of the deployment.  We were active as a group for possibly the last time in a full campaign.  And even that was difficult because Asher became the Imperium sky marshal and was directing operations against such targets as a resurgent Circle of Two.  But we helped ignite the fire of war that ended with a payoff in faction Fortizars. This was also the start of Zungen ops, where we were added to pings to go help the Black Ops squad drop on hostile ratters.  That lasted up until just a couple of months ago when Bee Foreign Legion (BFL) squad was formed… another USTZ group… and became the source for auxiliaries for Black Ops.  (I applied but was kicked when the changed the requirements to include capital operations, which my meager PI financed budget could not sustain.) Things start to slow down somewhat after year five.  We went on occasional ops, and were a source for special activities when needed, but Asher being heavily involved in main fleet operations kept him busy.  Then came the 59 weeks of World War Bee with Asher again as sky marshal.  Then there was the fall of The Mittani and Asher ascending to the leadership of the Imperium. Kind of hard to run a small squad on the side when you rule a massive coalition. Still, Reavers feel like it is one of ours running the show.  More than one of ours, really, as a number of Reavers have ended up in director positions within GSF. My only post with the Reavers tag since the ninth anniversary involves Zungen ops and ramping up operations in the Dronelands.  I went along with that until I didn’t make the cut for BFL, at which point I was off the ping list.  Some day I’ll move the stuff I have stored there back to Jita to dispose of… but I have other moving priorities right now. We still have a channel on Mumble and a Discord server and there is still and annual Reavers Secret Santa, which I much prefer to the wide open GSF Secret Santa.  But otherwise things are pretty quiet for Reavers these days. My past annual posts about the group which summarizes, if not all the activities, at least the ones I was around for. A Year of Reavers Two Years of Reavers Three Years of Reavers Four Years of Reavers Five Years of Reavers Six Years of Reavers Seven Years of Reavers Eight Years of Reavers Nine Years of Reavers What will the next year bring?  I suspect things will continue to be quiet, that the time for Reavers may have passed for good.  But you never know.",

including the camp of the traitors of Circle of Two in Impass.  We were later told that we had a spy who was going to betray them and we were there to cover operations should they proceed, but that didn’t come to pass until later.  We came home and had to await \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2017/09/12/the-imperium-buys-a-keepstar/\"\u003eJudgement Day for CO2\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYear four found us working out of an NPC station in Pure Blind for what would later become a full scale war.  I was actually tired of \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e at that time and was considering taking a break.  But then the whole thing developed of the months of the deployment.  We were active as a group for possibly the last time in a full campaign.  And even that was difficult because Asher became the Imperium sky marshal and was directing operations against such targets as a resurgent Circle of Two.  But we helped ignite the fire of war that ended with a \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2018/09/20/the-war-in-the-north-ends-with-a-payoff/\"\u003epayoff in faction Fortizars\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was also the start of Zungen ops, where we were added to pings to go help the Black Ops squad drop on hostile ratters.  That lasted up until just a couple of months ago when Bee Foreign Legion (BFL) squad was formed… another USTZ group… and became the source for auxiliaries for Black Ops.  (I applied but was kicked when the changed the requirements to include capital operations, which my meager PI financed budget could not sustain.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings start to slow down somewhat after year five.  We went on occasional ops, and were a source for special activities when needed, but Asher being heavily involved in main fleet operations kept him busy.  \u003ca
