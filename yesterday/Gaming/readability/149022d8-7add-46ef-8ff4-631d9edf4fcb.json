  "text": "We live to fight, Legends. This season we’re showing that the community rules all as some of your favorite creators are taking over content and competition. These Creator Commissioners will create challenges based on their own Apex experiences, with fresh and unique items available to earn. Gear up with Arsenals, new shops stocked with everything you need to hit the battlefield immediately. All of this, plus the addition of Legend updates and bold meta changes, we’ve planned quite the party this season. But that’s not all we’re celebrating:  our Anniversary Event kicks off along with the new season with even more community created content and the debut of the Mythic R-301. Apex Legends: Takeover launches on February 11.  Creator Commissioners Four different Creator Commissioners will take the reins for two weeks each, along with their own challenges to conquer, new and returning fan-favorite modes, and fresh rewards. On week one, work with other players to complete Community challenges and ultimately determine how many Apex Packs will be up for grabs the following week.  On week two, it’s time to really earn those rewards. Work through five individual challenges to unlock a creator-selected Legendary weapon skin and the Apex Packs you chased in the first week. Participating in week one doesn’t automatically earn you rewards in week two, so you’ll want to jump into matches in the second week too.  Creator Commissioners and their Legendary choices: February 25 – March 10, 2025: NinjaylaLegendary skin: Wingman’s Death Ray March 11 – 24, 2025: OraxeLegendary skin: Kraber’s The Pioneer April 1-14, 2025: ApryzeLegendary skin: Mastiff’s Bone Breaker April 15 – 28, 2025: Kaminari KyupiLegendary skin: Mastiff’s Tombstick Arsenals This new addition to Battle Royale provides easy and consistent access to weapons and ammo of your choice. Stations will be located across all POIs on every map with fixed locations, but with random ammo types per match. Arsenals will also provide relevant ammo and the ability to enhance weapons. You can enhance one weapon per Arsenal and that weapon must match the Arsenal’s ammo type. Doing so will grant an upgraded attachment and provide an optic if the weapon is missing one. When bins reset, so too do Arsenals—giving you the ability to upgrade again with higher potency. The amount of ammo also significantly increases after a reset. Meta changes Everything changes this season with fresh meta updates that you’ll want to check out ASAP. Most notably, all weapon classes are getting adjusted to feel more competitive with Assault Rifles. Be aware that the time-to-kill has been decreased, not only due to these weapon adjustments, but also thanks to updates to Armor, Helmets, and headshot multipliers. Legends also get some nifty new updates: the Assault class is getting handy new perks, and both Ash and Ballistic are getting some special attention. We’ve also made some adjustments to regen items to ensure you still have a fighting chance while taking on these lethal changes. Legend Spotlight Passes Complete challenges with the new Legend Spotlight Pass to increase your proficiency with a potential new Legend, and earn rewards as you progress through twenty levels to the ultimate goal: a Legendary skin pack for that Legend. You can purchase one per season per Legend in the in-game store, and it will also unlock the Legend if you haven’t already. Takeover launches February 11, 2025. Trending Stories",
