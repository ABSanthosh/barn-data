There are also several other bonuses and perks, which we’ve list out below.How do I catch a shiny Quaxly?As per old research by the now-defunct website The Silph Road (via Wayback Machine), Shiny rates on Community Days are about 1 in 24, which means that if you keep playing throughout the three-hour window, you should find quite a few shiny Pokémon.Graphic: Julia Lee/Polygon | Source images: NianticIf you’re short on time or Poké Balls, you can pop an Incense, then quickly tap each Quaxly to check for shiny ones, running from any that aren’t shiny. Notably, any Quaxly you’ve already tapped will face where your player is standing, so that should help identify which ones you may have already checked.What Community Day move does Quaxly’s evolution learn?If you evolve Quaxwell into Quaquaval from July 20 at 2 p.m. until July 27 at 10 p.m. in your local time, it will learn Hydro Cannon.If you miss out on evolving it during this period, you will likely be able to evolve it during a Community Day weekend event in December to get whichever move, but know that since the evolution requirements are lessened during this event, it’s easier to just do it now. If you don’t want to wait, you can use an Elite TM to get the move.How does Quaquaval do in the meta?Quaquavel is a decent PvE pick, but if you have the likes of Kyogre, Mega Swampert, Mega Blastoise, or even Primarina, you won’t really need to invest in this one. That all being said, if you’re a new player who still needs a decent water-type pick, you can totally invest in your Quaquavel and still be an asset to the team.As for PvP, even with Hydro Cannon at its side, it doesn’t really make big moves in PvP either.How do I make the most of Quaxly Community Day?The following bonuses will be active during Quaxly Community Day:Tripled Stardust from catching PokémonDoubled candy from catching PokémonDoubled chance for trainers level 31+ to find Candy XLIncense lasts three hoursLure Modules lasts three hoursQuaxly special photobombs when taking snapshotsOne additional Special Trade50% Stardust discount on tradesThat said, you should definitely use a Star Piece and an Incense and try to nab a ton of Quaxly.If you can Mega Evolve Blastoise, Slowbro, Gyarados, or Swampert, you’ll score additional candy per catch.There will also be “Community Day Continued” Timed Research until July 27 at 10 p.m. that will reward more Quaxly, including ones with special themed backgrounds. This research will keep the increased shiny rate for Quaxly, even after the three-hour event is over, so make sure you complete them for extra chances to get a shiny.",
