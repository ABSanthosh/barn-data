  "description": "Mario Kart World gives you the option to switch up your style instead of forcing you to wear the same old overalls or dresses in every race. Outfits and costumes are mostly reserved for the major characters like Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, etc. However, some side characters, such as King Boo and Shy Guy, also have a few different choices. Below, we'll show you every outfit in Mario Kart World and how to unlock them all.There are 50 Mario Kart World characters to unlock so far, and over 100 costumes spread between them all. Main characters like Mario tend to have up to 10 outfits, while characters like Lakitu have around two or three.To unlock new outfits, you need to eat specific food items. For example, Mario's Touring outfit is unlocked when you eat burgers while driving around as Mario. Eating food immediately puts the new outfit on your character and unlocks the outfit in the racer selection screen for future use. Some costumes can be unlocked through multiple foods, but we've listed all the ones we've confirmed.There are drive-through stations near several tracks where you'll see glowing take-out bags to the side of the road. Drive through those bags to pick up a food item, then use it to obtain a new outfit. The most efficient way to unlock all outfits is to enter Free Roam and go to the location that contains the food you want. Then, switch characters to eat that one food item multiple times, unlocking all outfits for the specific characters who need to eat the same food. For more details, check out our guide on how eating meals and unlocking costumes works.If you're looking to learn more about Mario Kart World, you can click the stories and guides below for more information:Mario Kart World Lets Players Rewind If They Make A MistakeHow To Get Speed Boosts In Mario Kart World - All MethodsBattle Mode Is Back In Mario Kart World, Two Minigames ConfirmedMario Kart World Isn't Telling You The Truth About Character And Vehicle StatsMario Kart World Features Giant Trucks And Boats You Can Use To Dominate Races Touring MarioThe Touring Mario outfit can be unlocked by eating a burger, which can be found right next to the Mario Bros.

Outfits and costumes are mostly reserved for the major characters like Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, etc. However, some side characters, such as King Boo and Shy Guy, also have a few different choices. Below, we\u0026#39;ll show you every outfit in Mario Kart World and how to unlock them all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are 50 \u003ca href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-mario-kart-9-racer/2900-6141/\" data-ref-id=\"2900-6141\"\u003eMario Kart World characters\u003c/a\u003e to unlock so far, and over 100 costumes spread between them all. Main characters like Mario tend to have up to 10 outfits, while characters like Lakitu have around two or three.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo unlock new outfits, you need to eat specific food items. For example, Mario\u0026#39;s Touring outfit is unlocked when you eat burgers while driving around as Mario. Eating food immediately puts the new outfit on your character and unlocks the outfit in the racer selection screen for future use. Some costumes can be unlocked through multiple foods, but we\u0026#39;ve listed all the ones we\u0026#39;ve confirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are drive-through stations near several tracks where you\u0026#39;ll see glowing take-out bags to the side of the road. Drive through those bags to pick up a food item, then use it to obtain a new outfit. The most efficient way to unlock all outfits is to enter Free Roam and go to the location that contains the food you want. Then, switch characters to eat that one food item multiple times, unlocking all outfits for the specific characters who need to eat the same food.
