Stars Reach – Continued Testing As I had kind of done most of the things available… at least the items that interested me up to that point… I figured I would stand back and let the new people explore.  That got me a bit out of the habit of logging in when they had tests running. And then, once the Kickstarter campaign was done… well, I was busy and there are only so many play test hours during the week.  I know they’re trying to recruit some mods for off hours so the team can get work done and sleep while the game runs 24/7.  But that is still in the future. However, I found some time on Saturday to jump into the afternoon test they were running to see how things were progressing.  I expected to start from scratch and was not disappointed on that front.  We’re still in the randomly assigned character looks, but I was fine with this outfit. Once more into Stars Reach I started off to see what was going on, but on equipping my omni blaster to deal with some of the local mobs I got the dreaded crash. You will need to restart the game now On every game load you get a new look, so when I got back in I was a little more svelte.  Also, I was very quickly on fire as the mobs and their aggressive tendencies were still very much apparent. A different look, but the same pain It was time to run away.  Fortunately, there was some water nearby to run through… and I mean run.  Water is more a concept of an idea at this point.  Sure, it is fun to freeze it, boil it, and drain it off into a lava field, but actually interacting with it means it is just a slightly wetter portion of the atmosphere. Running under water, fire gone Safe momentarily, I was able to look back and see where I had been and the flaming trees left behind from my encounter.  I am not even sure what was after me when I dropped back into the world.  A lot of stuff is very aggressive. Flaming trees in my wake I started looking into what had changed to see if I could find my way to a grav mesh or a grapple or any of the tools you no longer start with.  However, crafting had been through a big revamp and now my goal… always the grav mesh… was layered behind a bunch of tasks. The chain to get to my goal was not clear Well, that was off the menu for me.  I wasn’t feeling like figuring that out only to have it disappear with the next wipe. So I fell back on the explorer route.  I would go find those nodes and maybe unlock the map and a few other things along the way.  That led me to another discovery… the team had definitely been playing with atmospheric particles and draw distance and that sort of thing. Previously you had been able to spot the nodes from quite a distance away.  Now… well, you don’t have to trip over them, but you do have to get pretty close to see them.  I sat and fiddled with distance until I found the line between them being visible and not. Step back and… I don’t see anything Then take a step forward. Peekaboo! So if I was going to do that I was going to have to diligently quarter the map. (Also, as is always the case when the game has gone more than a couple of sessions without a reset, the world was a torn up mess of excavation holes and dumped tailing.) I started out on the hunt, dodging mobs and running back and forth along the terrain, finding a few of the nodes.  But then I realized that since I started playing the fans on my video card had spun all the way up and were now reaching a level of thrust that it sounded like the case was preparing for takeoff. I get it, the game is pre-Alpha, so it is still early and raw and not optimized.  But I don’t have a completely behind the curve video card, with a year old GeForce RTX 4070 12GB in my system.  It seems like a bit much if that level of video card is heating up to run the game. Not being keen to stress test the video card, I decided to leave it for another day.  I’ll give it another run when things seem less of a hazard to my hardware.",
