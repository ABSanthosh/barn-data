  "text": "Image via Tiny Roar | Published: Jun 10, 2025 04:56 am Set in a whimsical island world where players step into the shoes of a seaplane pilot taking over a family business, Lou’s Lagoon is an upcoming cozy adventure game developed by Tiny Roar and published by Megabit and rokaplay. The game combines elements of exploration, crafting, and delivery missions, presenting a charming blend of laid-back gameplay and gentle storytelling. All key elements of a true cozy game experience, but with a flying twist. The game’s location is the heart of Lou’s Lagoon, which appears in the form of the Limbo Archipelago, a sun-drenched paradise filled with colorful islands, quirky characters, and secrets waiting to be uncovered. To begin your journey, you inherit a seaplane delivery service from Uncle Lou, who has mysteriously disappeared. However, taking over the business involves more than just delivering packages. You must restore the outposts, gather resources, and build relationships with the island’s uniquely anthropomorphized inhabitants. Image via Tiny Roar A major pull of this game is flying. It’s not just a loading screen while you hop between islands; it is a core mechanic to the game. You’ll pilot the seaplane yourself across the archipelago, weaving through ring courses, upgrading items, and discovering new landing spots. It’s not about precision flying or fast-paced challenges but rather a relaxing and scenic journey through lush landscapes. The ability to explore by air adds a wonderful sense of freedom, making even mundane deliveries feel like tiny adventures. The seaplane does take a little time to master. However, it’s worth taking the time to practice and explore the skies for those hidden story gems. To help you complete your tasks and customize your surroundings is the resource-gathering ‘Swirler 2000’, a vacuum-like tool that sucks up materials like driftwood, scrap metal and even animal fur! These resources are used to repair buildings, cook meals, and enhance your aircraft. The Swirler simplifies crafting without sacrificing engagement, allowing players to focus on exploration and creativity rather than individually hacking down every element needed for your task.  Image via Tiny Roar Customization is central to open-world games and cozy ones in particular. While on Lou’s island, you can create your own home base with handcrafted furniture and tailor your character’s appearance. While the building element still needs some polish, you’ll certainly be eager to unlock the different objects and machines on offer to make the island your own. Some items are even interactable, allowing you to cook and bake with food foraged from the island.  Unlike many other games in the genre, Lou’s Lagoon removes traditional survival stressors. There’s no real combat, fall damage, or stamina meters. Instead, the game focuses on creating a peaceful environment that encourages exploration and storytelling, and it’s clear the developers wanted to find the line between sandbox and quest-driven storytelling. As players interact with townsfolk and build relationships, they’ll slowly uncover what happened to Uncle Lou, adding a sense of purpose and progression. With its bright visuals, customizable areas, and peaceful world-building, Lou’s Lagoon offers players a delightful escape into island life. Whether you’re delivering letters or upgrading your seaplane to reach hidden areas, the game promotes adventure and discovery. You can add Lou’s Lagoon to your Steam Wishlist now.
