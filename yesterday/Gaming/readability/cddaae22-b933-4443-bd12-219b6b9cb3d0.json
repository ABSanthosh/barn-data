  "text": "Collabs announced in new roadmap. Image credit: Eurogamer/Yellow Brick Games/Grasshopper Manufacture Eternal Strands, the well-received action-RPG from Dragon Age boss Mike Laidlaw's Yellow Brick Games studio, has shared its latest roadmap, promising - among other things - free DLC created in collaboration with Final Fantasy concept artist Yusuki Mogi and, separately, No More Heroes studio Grasshopper Manufacture. Eternal Strands, if you're in need of a refresher, launched last month, inviting players to follow the adventures of Brynn - a member of a dwindling group of magic users known as the Weavers - who sets out across a fantasy kingdom ravaged by a cataclysmic magical event to uncover its mysteries and recover her people's cultural home. In gameplay terms, it borrows bits from the likes of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Shadow of the Colossus, with a bit of Monster Hunter thrown in - a mix Christian Donlan reckoned made for a \"combustible and hilarious sandbox\" in his four star Eurogamer review. Eternal Strands - Launch Trailer | Yellow Brick Games Eternal Strands launch trailer.Watch on YouTube And now, with Eternal Strands' first month of release almost behind it, Yellow Brick Games is ready to start discussing its post-launch plans. And that begins with a \"Day 30 Patch\" coming in March and promising a range of enhancements. There's talk of improved character movement to reduce its \"slippery\" sensation, for instance, as well as improved combat responsiveness, reduced Umbral Darter presence in certain areas, bug fixes, and more. Then it's onto the fun stuff. Sometime this \"spring\", Eternal Strands will receive its first free DLC. This'll see Yellow Brick teaming up with Final Fantasy XIV and XVI concept artist Yusuke Mogi to design and introduce a new in-game epic, a new armour set, and new weapon skins. Eternal Strands' spring update also promises a new map and magic power, a weapon and armour dying system, Oria's tips and tricks, plus further bug fixes. Image credit: Yellow Brick Games That'll eventually lead into summer, when Eternal Strands' second free DLC update arrives. This is a collaboration with No More Heroes studio Grasshopper Manufacture, and is set to deliver currently unspecified \"new content\", among other things. Ahead of March's first major patch release, Yellow Brick has shared developer notes outlining its key changes in more detail. Additionally, the studio is set to hold an Eternal Strands Ask Me Anything on Reddit this Thursday, 27th February at 4pm GMT, where it'll be nattering about everything from the game's lore to the future features and content it has planned.",
