You can save $10 off Anker's new and improved high-capacity power bank, or treat yourself to a premium gaming chair on sale during Secretlab's Presidents' Day Sale. If you're a fan of Witcher's famous card game series, the IGN Store has a tabletop Gwent deck up for preorder. Check out more of today's deals down below.Apple AirPods Pro for $169Apple AirPods Pro 2 with USB-CJust in time for Valentine's Day, Amazon is offering the 2nd generation Apple AirPods Pro wireless noise-canceling earbuds for only $169 shipped, a savings of 32% off and the best price so far this year. Although the new AirPods 4 earbuds are also discounted (the noise-canceling model is currently priced at $148.99), between the two, the AirPods Pro are still the best earbuds because of superior sound quality and noise cancelation.New Release: Anker 25,000mAh 165W Power BankAnker 25,000mAh 165W Power Bank with Two Built-In USB Type-C CablesAnker quietly released a new high-capacity power bank earlier this year that sits alongside the Anker 737 and Prime series of power banks. This particular model boasts a massive 25,000mAh battery capacity, 165W of total charging output, and two built-in USB Type-C cables in case you forget to bring your own. It's also attractively priced at under $100, and there's even a deal today that drops the price by another $10 to $89.99. This is a great complement to your power-hungry gaming handheld PC like the Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, or Lenovo Legion Go.Secretlab Presidents' Day SaleSecretlab has already kicked off its Presidents' Day Sale, which starts now and runs until February 17. Save up to $139 off Secretlab's popular Titan line of gaming chairs, Magnus gaming desks (including the Magnus Pro electric standing desk model), and accessories like the Secretlab Skins upholstery covers, desk mats, cable management, and more. Unfortunately, new releases like the Titan Evo Nanogen chair and the recliner add-on are exempt from this sale. Preorder the Gwent Card Game at the IGN StorePreorder The Witcher: Gwent The Legendary Card GameHere's your chance to preorder the tabletop version of Witcher's addictive card game. This is an officially licensed and CD Projekt Red backed edition consisting of over 400 playing cards faithfully reproducing the iconic designs from The Witcher 3. Preorders ship out sometime in August.Vita Coco Coconut Water Makes the Best Smoothie BasesLenovo Presidents' Day SaleLenovo Legion Tower 7i Intel Core i9-14900KF RTX 4080 Super Gaming PC with 32GB RAM, 2TB SSDApply second code: BUYMORELENOVO (may be auto applied)Lenovo Legion Tower 5 AMD Ryzen 7 7700 RTX 4070 Ti Super Gaming PC with 32GB RAM, 1TB SSDApply second code: BUYMORELENOVO (may be auto applied)Lenovo has kicked off its Presidents' Day sale early with big price drops on two of its most popular Legion prebuilt gaming desktop computers. You will have to apply two stackable coupon codes: \"EXTRAFIVE\" and \"BUYMORELENOVO\", although the second one might automatically be added to your cart. If you're waiting for RTX 50-series GPUs to come back in stock, don't. The RTX 40-series GPUs easily meet current gaming needs at a more affordable price point, and they're readily in stock.In our recent Legion Tower 7 review, Jacqueline Thomas wrote that \"the Legion Tower 7i is an incredibly powerful gaming PC, especially for the money you’re likely going to be paying for it. If all you want is a powerful, upgradeable machine without having to go through the trouble of building it yourself, it’s hard to find many gaming PCs better than this one.\"Seagate Expansion 20TB Desktop Hard DriveSeagate Expansion 20TB USB 3.0 Desktop Hard DriveIf you're shopping for a huge amount of local storage, here's a deal that beats pretty much anything I saw during Black Friday. For a limited time, Best Buy is offering this massive Seagate Expansion 20TB USB 3.0 Desktop Hard Drive for only $229.99 shipped. That averages out to a mere $11.50 per TB of storage.Buy One Get One 50% Off SteelSeries Gaming PeripheralsSteelSeries has kicked off an impressive Valentine's Day Sale with a rare promotion: buy one gaming headset, mouse, keyboard, or other gaming accessory and get a second item for 50% off with coupon \"VALENTINE50\". The second item will be of equal or lesser value and does not stack with instant discounts. All orders over $49 ship free. The Nova Pro is our favorite gaming headset, and we also recently picked the Apex Pro Gen 3 as the best gaming keyboard.Note that in all of my examples, I added two of the same item to cart to activate the discount. However, you don't need to buy the same item. For instance, you could add the Arctis Nova Pro wireless headset and the Apex Pro keyboard and get 50% off the keyboard (since it's the lower priced item).Apple AirPods 4 for Only $99.99Apple AirPods 4Amazon has discounted the newest generation Apple AirPods 4 earbuds by up to 25% off. The base model is currently down to $99.99 (originally $129). This is the first time we've seen the AirPods 4 earbuds drop below $100. In fact, that's a better deal than what we saw during Black Friday or Cyber Monday.30% Off Panther Vision Hand Warmers and Lighted BeaniesPanther Vision Powercap 3.0 Lighted Headlamp BeaniePanther Vision Powerpaw 602R Electric Hand Warmer and Power BankIf you're looking for a practical Valentine's Day gift idea, Panther Vision is offering a big 30% coupon code that works sitewide. If you suffer from cold appendages, the Panther Vision 602R rechargeable hand warmer is small enough to fit in your jacket pocket. It offers three different heat settings depending on how numb your fingers are, boasts an IP67 waterproof rating, and can even double up as a 5,000mAh USB Type-C power bank for emergencies.Pair it with the Panther Vision lighted beanie, which will keep your noggin warm while lighting up the way with a built-in LED headlamp rated for up to 150 lumens at max output. If you prioritize longevity over intensity, the 15-lumen setting will last up to 10 hours on a single charge. There are plenty of other useful gadgets on the site, including portable lamps and flashlights, so you might want to stock up to reach the $60 free shipping threshold.PDP Riffmaster Wireless Guitar Controller for $104PDP Riffmaster Wireless Guitar ControllerThe Riffmaster wireless guitar controller sold out quickly when it first launched in 2024, but it's back and discounted today. This is one of very few widely available guitar controller peripherals that works with Rock Band 4 and Fortnite Festival.Apple iPad 10.9\" 10th Gen for $279Ahead of Valentine's Day, Amazon has just dropped the price of the latest model 10th gen Apple iPad to $279 shipped. Currently all colors including Blue, Silver, Pink, and Yellow are discounted. Although this price is about $20 higher than what we saw during Black Friday, This is the best price we've seen so far this year for the 10th gen iPad.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
