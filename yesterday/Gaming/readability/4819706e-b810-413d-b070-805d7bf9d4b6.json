But Tales of Seikyu, which fits into that second camp, is different, I promise, because it has dating - and I think you can date an anthropomorphic otter man. I'm not talking queer slang here to be clear, though the character does kind of fit that meaning too. I'm talking about a man that looks like an otter, who walks around on two legs. Read more",

  "text": "On the otter hand, maybe it's better to leave the heart wanting Image credit: ACE Entertainment Alright, look, I get it. There's a lot of farming sims already. There's even the odd anime inspired farming sim here and there. But Tales of Seikyu, which fits into that second camp, is different, I promise, because it has dating - and I think you can date an anthropomorphic otter man. I'm not talking queer slang here to be clear, though the character does kind of fit that meaning too. I'm talking about a man that looks like an otter, who walks around on two legs. Now, I'm not entirely sure if he is romanceable or not, because a press release notes there's only six romanceable characters. He does appear on the splash screen for dateable characters during the game's early access release date trailer (we'll get to that in a minute), though more than six characters can be seen there. I'll just have to cross my fingers and hope that you can when the game launches into early access on Steam this May 21st (see, I told you we'd get there). Tales of Seikyu - Release Date Trailer Watch on YouTube The game has got a bit more going for it than the usual farming sim stuff too. Yes, you can grow your own veggies and such, the difference is that you use the powers of a yokai to do it. Sometimes you might turn into a water sucking slime, other times a speedy flying crow person. It's pretty cute! There's some action elements too, you can go off on little adventures and discover Seikyu's \"secrets.\" I'm not going to say that the game looks mind blowing, there really are just so many farming games these days, but there's enough going for me vibes wise to say I'm prospectively into it. Dating the otter man will cinch the deal though, ACE Entertainment, so consider that if you want my money.",
