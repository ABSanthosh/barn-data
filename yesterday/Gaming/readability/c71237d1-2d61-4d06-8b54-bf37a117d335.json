  "text": "Hungry Horrors is a deckbuilder with roguelike aspects where you need to cook meals for monsters instead of fighting them. You are a little princess, who is looking to feed those who want to attack you, instead of fighting them off with some sort of weapon. Using your magical cooking pot, you must draw a hand of cards and then spend them to satiate monsters. The foods you make all have their own flavor notes which can combo up when you match what a monster wants, allowing you to fill them up quickly. Clearly inspired by the likes of Slay the Spire, you can choose where you go next, picking paths that might lead to adding new cards to your deck or even boss fights against even bigger monsters. You can also play cards on yourself from time to time to increase your health, or use potions if you are in a bind in order to slow down the monsters. They just want to get close enough to eat you! When playing Hungry Horrors at New Game Plus, I found the way that these combos work and the variety of foods cooked through these cards felt unique. Some of the combos that I ended up creating, through a bit of luck, overfed these hungry monsters. Each time you do die, though, you make your way back to your castle where you can just try again and reset your card deck by cooking up more treats to take with you on your adventure. Hungry Horrors doesn’t, in its current state, feel as intense as other deckbuilders I have played, but it has its own unique aspects and mechanics that I very much enjoy seeing the results of! Some of the monsters are also quite challenging in their own ways. Hungry Horrors is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can grab a demo or add it to your wishlist on Steam.
