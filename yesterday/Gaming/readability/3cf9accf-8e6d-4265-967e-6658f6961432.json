My coworker last week. I was wearing a little more coverage than usual, so I think the overall look was more polished than the bare bones FOTDs I’ve been wearing for months now. Amazing what a difference a little bit of concealer makes! 2. Last dream you can remember? Marnie and I were like the Scooby Doo detectives in our neighborhood, ha ha ha! We were working a case to unveil who had stolen all the tuna sandwiches in our circle. 3. Today the temperature in my neighborhood is/was ____. The Bay Area is experiencing a heat wave, ugh!

I’m mostly happy to be relatively pain free; I fell down a couple weeks ago and hurt my neck and back, and it’s only now that I’m finally starting to feel like myself again. It should also be finally slowing down at work for a bit (it’s been a crazy couple of months), so I’m hoping to not be so exhausted at the end of the day and have more energy for my non-work life.
