  "text": "Hello, Rovers! I’m excited to share new information on upcoming Wuthering Waves content on behalf of the entire dev team. Cross-platform open-world ARPG Wuthering Waves has been live on PS5, with support for data-sharing across PS5, PC, and mobile devices, offering a seamless gaming experience on different platforms. With the new version 2.2 Tangled Truth in Inverted Tower set to launch on March 26, the game will introduce new characters, maps, gameplays, and more content—plus, players will receive a free 5-Star weapon as a reward for completing the Main Quest. New main quest: Venture into Avinoleum to unveil the truth behind Cartethyia and Sentinel In reflection on the story of version 2.0, the mysterious girl Cartethyia and the missing Imperator harbor deep secrets that remain to be uncovered. The upcoming version 2.2 will feature the new Main Quests: The Maiden, The Defier, and The Death Crier. This adventure kicks off at Beohr Waters, located behind Porto-Veno Castle, and leads Rover to an inverted region in mid-air known as Avinoleum—an exploration that uncovers the past. The history of Rinascita and the truth about Sentinel will gradually come to light within this inverted seminary. During the quest, rovers can obtain the 5-Star Sword Bloodpact’s Pledge for free. New Resonator-Cantarella \u0026 Rover: Aero The new 5-Star Resonator Cantarella, known as the 36th Lead of the Fisalia family, will debut in version 2.2. As a Havoc Resonator armed with a Rectifier, she embodies the deep-sea and poisonous themes that define her family. In combat, Cantarella wields her umbrella, launching attacks with the aid of highly toxic jellyfish. Her unique attack method allows her to gather a special energy Trance. Once she harnesses this energy, executing heavy attacks on the ground can trigger the Mirage state, creating a surreal effect reminiscent of an underwater realm. When Cantarella consumes her Forte Gauge for attacks against foes, she can heal all team members. When certain conditions are met, her Resonance Skill can hinder enemy movement. Upon activating Resonance Liberation, she can carry out coordinated attacks for an extended duration, while her Outro Skill amplifies damage for both Havoc and Resonance Skills for the incoming Resonators. In version 2.2, following Spectro and Havoc, Rover will unlock a new attribute: Aero. Rover: Aero can conjure a one-handed sword, swiftly maneuver through the air, and strike their foes. Upon meeting specific conditions, Rover’s aerial attacks can also heal the entire team. Aero Rover can unleash Resonance Skill while airborne, and transform all Negative Status effects on enemies into Aero Erosion Effect. Activating the Outro Skill further increases the maximum stacks of Aero Erosion Effect. When Rover builds up enough energy during battle, they can summon a massive sword to crash down from the sky onto their target. After releasing Resonance Liberation, Rover will inflict Aero Damage on enemies while simultaneously healing all teammates. New Companion Story: Cantarella – A Fleeting Night’s Dream Cantarella’s Companion Story, A Fleeting Night’s Dream, will also become available in version 2.2. In this tale, a mysterious letter from the Ghost Girl guides Rover to a celebration—Night of Remembrance, taking place in Egla Town. Here, a girl in a red hat will unveil the hidden past tucked away in Porto-Veno Castle. Join Cantarella as we journey to the Sea of Ghosts, lifting the veil on the untold story waiting to be discovered. New map, new gameplay As the story unfolds, Rover will journey to a new region—Avinoleum. Once celebrated as the most magnificent seminary in Ragunna, it now towers towards the heavens alongside Sentinel, nearly out of reach. This area still bears the scars of the past, with countless Tacet Discords lingering from the Dark Tide outbreak. To protect against these Tacet Discords and prevent the Dark Tide from descending from above, the gravity in this region has been entirely reversed, with the dome now facing down toward the ground. Rover will face new gameplay challenges, including Gravity Adjustment, while delving deep into the Avinoleum. This area is home to numerous Gravity Calibrators, and as long as they are activated, players can alter the direction of gravity. In the year 2024, Wuthering Waves reached the milestone of 30 million downloads worldwide in the first month of its official release, garnering numerous accolades, including PS Blog’s Players’ Choice. This is just the beginning. Following the game’s launch on the PS5, we’re striving through unremitting efforts to bring thrilling content to players worldwide. Version 2.2 will live on March 26—Rovers, embark on the adventure into the inverted tower with Cartethyia and Cantarella to uncover the hidden truth and Rinascita’s untold past. Trending Stories",
