  "description": "Britain in the ‘60s was a weird place. The Beatles had conquered the world and Sean Connery’s Bond redefined the modern gentleman; from the outside looking in, the influential isle was the height of cool. Yet peel back the surface, and you’d discover an altogether stranger Britain bubbling beneath its glitzy exterior. It’s a mood perfectly captured in Rebellion’s Atomfall, a post-apocalyptic action survival epic that fully embraces the scary ‘60s and leans into Britannia at its most eerie.",
