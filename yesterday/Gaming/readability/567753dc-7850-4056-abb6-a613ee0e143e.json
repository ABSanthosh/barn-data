You know, I thought of you the other day when I put lipstick on right before work; it was MAC Sweet Deal, a mid-tone pink that looks like a neutral on my skin. Anywho, I wondered if you were still keeping up with wearing lip color all week long. I hope so! Even though I wasn‚Äôt adventurous with color, I‚Äôm happy to report I wore Sweet Deal all through the week. I grabbed it on Monday right before I brought Connor to school. We did a short presentation on Filipino History Month for all the grades in her elementary! You can kinda see it here in this pic one of her teachers took of us. üôÇ The presentation went well, and I think Connor was excited to share different things about Filipino history and culture.

Anywho, work at the college was busy this week, although we did have a fun little team building exercise which involved me dressing up as a ghost in a wrinkly old sheet and jumping up and down in a field full of flowers. We also climbed the dive tower at the aquatic center to do a ghost picture, and I stood on the seven meter platform which shockingly FREAKED ME OUT. I never thought that I was afraid of heights until I tried to walk to the edge. In my mind, I was logically thinking, ‚ÄúHey, if I fall, at least I‚Äôd fall into some water,‚Äù but oh no. There was something about standing at the edge looking down that was really, really scary. Are you dressing up for Halloween? Sadly the wrinkly sheet is the most prep I‚Äôve done for one of my favorite holidays. I really have to come up with a last-minute costume!
