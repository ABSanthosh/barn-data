  "text": "lineoff sends you deep into a very dangerous machine filled with moving saw blades so you can clean all the dust out of it. I am not sure this job would pass any sort of health and safety inspection, but given how many dangerous tasks I’ve had to do over my years of employment at various places (can’t exactly blow the whistle if you need that job to stay fed and housed, right?), I would not be surprised if there’s a couple of places out there that would put you to work doing this. Anyway, your job is to clean out small specks of dust so this fast, deadly cutting machine runs smoothly. Naturally, no one is going to lock out the machine while you do it, so expect to hop around like your life depends on it. It does not take very long before those blades start coming at you in pairs and move like someone at the controls is increasing the speed. There is a running counter at the top of the screen to let you know how many dust motes you manage to pick up before you (thankfully, comically) get gutted by one of the rushing blades. It’s not all in vain if you die in the service of your employer, though. The overall number of dust motes you pick up adds to a running total that steadily unlocks new colors for the game. So, the next employee in line can find themselves cut in half in an entirely new shade of spiffy machine. Isn’t that wonderful? lineoff is fast, frantic, and straightforward, and it doesn’t take long before it has you leaning over and tense at your keyboard as you thread yourself between the lethal hazards. Although I hope your own job is at least a little less dangerous than this. lineoff is available now (for whatever you wish to pay for it) on itch.io.
