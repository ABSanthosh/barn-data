Stars Reach is coming Things had been reset since the last time I was on that meant logging into the test started me back at square one.   There was a new, short tutorial that I ran through, just to try it. Greetings Meatbag! After that it was all the usual starting stuff… which I have to admit is not getting more charming with each run.  It isn’t so much the eternal do-over routine, but that it gets a little more involved and difficult with each pass. I get it, they are building up the start to a larger game and we’re there to test as opposed to progress, but it can suck a bit of the enthusiasm out of you when it is back to equipping yourself once more. One of the allures of the new test was an additional planet to explore, Pyromycis.  Described as an “exotic” planet, it would have a some new beasts and harvestables to add to the mix.  However, after making my new character and logging in, I seemed to be on what looked very much like a temperate planet. That is a pretty temperate planetary vista That was fine.  I could get myself together there then move on to the new exotic world when I was ready.  The first thing on my list was the grav mesh, which makes navigation so much easier. That meant getting out the survey tool and registering some nodes, something I had done many time before, in order to accumulate enough ranger points to unlock the grav mesh recipe.  While there were some nodes out in the world that seemed like they were going to be difficult to achieve, most of it was the usual running around and avoiding mobs until you hit 20 nodes. We’ll save that one for later Getting 20 nodes wasn’t that hard, though I had a couple of run ins with the local fauna and died.  But I hadn’t been collecting anything, so I just left some corpses around the place while got my unlock.  And soon enough I have the recipe for the grav mesh, only to discover the recipe had changed. What it takes to make a grav mesh Previously it have been tier 3 metals and industrial gems.  That changed with this round to require anti-gravium, a new resource added with this test and only available on the new planet.  I needed to get to Pyromycis! Fortunately, the portal was close to hand and people were lined up to get in it seemed. The portal has a bit of a crowd As it turned out though, those were likely people who entered the portal only to find out, as I did, that space wasn’t having us.  Space was down. At the user end, that meant getting to the portal loading screen and just sitting there with no feedback at all. Just sitting on this screen The app wasn’t locked up, it didn’t crash, it just sat there doing nothing.  I know, we’re in pre-alpha, but my own career in software has made me a bit obsessive about error handling.  The kid out of college can write the happy path code, it is the seasoned veteran that anticipates and catches possible user behavior ahead of time. I submitted a bug about that in that screen, because the app was up and running.  It just wasn’t loading space.  I went off and made a sandwich for lunch and came back and found myself still there.  In Discord it had been reported in the text channel that space was down.  I wasn’t on voice because, as usual, voice was very busy with people narrating their journeys which I find distracting and difficult to get a word in edgewise with.  I am too polite and will let people finish. Getting out of that meant exiting the game and logging back in, which I did, then went running around to collect some more survey points… why not.  This seemed to be a re-roll of the temperate world with some new locations… and even some of those new mobs mentioned in the test notes, something that didn’t really click with me… mostly because they were so good at killing me. This time the flying reefsharks got me My review of the new mobs is that they seem even deadlier than the old and I tried to give them a wide berth when I could. Avoiding a Gashog I slipped around the edge, spent some time hiding in a corner of the world, and ran around trying not to get zapped by the various baddies. Hiding in the corner, so to speak Then news popped up in chat that space was back up and I recalled back to the camp by the portal and headed in, loading up in space successfully this time. One of the features that came with this test was that the portals in space were now all labeled with the planet they connected to.  So when I got into space I was able to see… that I had been on Pyromycis the whole time. Similar to my reaction to the “jungle” world that was about as much of a jungle as Balboa Park (the planet type has since been changed to “tropical”), the new “exotic” world seemed to be about as exotic as Truckee… I said, making some very California references. So it was back into the portal and back to the planet I had spent all my time so far to find some of this anti-gravium. Thinking that it would be in the same category as gems, since it replaced gems, I went and got my excavation going to unlock assaying so I could find some of this new thing. However, once I got that leveled up I went through the assaying options to find my goal. You scroll through a series of options However, anti-gravium was not on the list. In the post test fireside it was mentioned that anti-gravium was mined out on the planet quickly, and I arrived two hours into the four hour test, so I was out of luck in any case. So I assayed for diamonds… because why not… and went and found some of those, just to keep in practice. Diamonds this away I then ran out my time just doing some more exploring. I did have a few smaller issues with the client going unresponsive, some lag, and the UI doing some odd things.   There was some freezing where what I saw stopped, but I apparently kept moving.  There were also an odd white out issues that came and went a few times… enough times that I got a screen shot of it. The screen whited out while in game And I had an odd freeze where the cursor would move, but left a trail. The cursor leaving trails But mostly things worked and I experienced no crashes.  And then time ran out and we were done. After all of that there was the fireside, which included the announcement that there would be a Kickstarter campaign to help further the funding of the the project. This will not at all be the sole funding of the project.  Raph said there had already been $38 million invested in the game so far.  However, this is will be a litmus for how much demand there is for the game.  A good outcome will help the team achieve additional funding to get the game to the finish line. The Kickstarter campaign is about a month out, but you can go to the campaign page now and click the button to be notified when it goes live. So go check out the campaign here, click the follow button if you are interested. It was noted Raph that he is aware that some of us have been burned on MMORPG Kickstarters in the past.  But Stars Reach isn’t some future destination, a vision and some vague artists conception images.  People have been playing it.  It is pre-alpha, but it is a thing.  Or as the team put it in their email about the Kickstarter: The game is already playable. Hundreds of players have been exploring and enjoying Stars Reach for the past six months. We’re five years into development. Most of the hardest work is behind us. This Kickstarter is about finishing the game—not starting it. Still, Kickstarter is for those who can manage it.  I am sure I will have opinions once we see what is being offered and what the goal is.  Until then, we wait.
