  "description": "Overwatch 2 has introduced a new competitive multiplayer mode, Stadium, where you play a best-of-seven series of matches. This mode is drastically different from other Overwatch 2 game modes for a number of reasons. First, there is a limited pool of heroes, with only 18 to start, though more will be added in the future. Second, it's a third-person game that takes place across several rounds, each consisting of shortened matches similar to Push. Lastly, and most importantly, it has new abilities and perks you buy in between rounds, allowing you to create unique builds of your hero.As a match unfolds, you'll earn currency every round, and in between rounds, you gain access to the shop, where you can buy permanent upgrades for the rest of the match. Because of this new system, you are locked to the character you choose at the start of the match and cannot swap later, making this a massive change from other modes. For example, Soldier 76 has multiple powers he can choose from. One will briefly activate his ultimate after firing a Helix rocket, while a different power will increase his primary fire power by 0.5% for each continuous shot fired. These different powers and abilities can drastically change how a hero plays, creating a dynamic new competitive mode.Over the course of a match, you can get up to six items, which can be sold at any point, and four powers, which you are stuck with once acquired. Below, we have listed every hero currently available in Stadium mode, along with their character-specific abilities and powers, followed by a list of universal items.

Overwatch 2 has introduced a new competitive multiplayer mode, Stadium, where you play a best-of-seven series of matches. This mode is drastically different from other Overwatch 2 game modes for a number of reasons. First, there is a limited pool of heroes, with only 18 to start, though more will be added in the future. Second, it's a third-person game that takes place across several rounds, each consisting of shortened matches similar to Push. Lastly, and most importantly, it has new abilities and perks you buy in between rounds, allowing you to create unique builds of your hero.As a match unfolds, you'll earn currency every round, and in between rounds, you gain access to the shop, where you can buy permanent upgrades for the rest of the match. Because of this new system, you are locked to the character you choose at the start of the match and cannot swap later, making this a massive change from other modes. For example, Soldier 76 has multiple powers he can choose from. One will briefly activate his ultimate after firing a Helix rocket, while a different power will increase his primary fire power by 0.5% for each continuous shot fired. These different powers and abilities can drastically change how a hero plays, creating a dynamic new competitive mode.Over the course of a match, you can get up to six items, which can be sold at any point, and four powers, which you are stuck with once acquired. Below, we have listed every hero currently available in Stadium mode, along with their character-specific abilities and powers, followed by a list of universal items.ReinhardtPowers:Smashing! - When you deal damage with [Rocket Hammer], gain 3% Move Speed and 5% Weapon Lifesteal for 3s, stacking up to 5 times.Feeling The Burn - Every 3rd [Rocket Hammer] swing burns the target, dealing 30% extra damage over 2s.Wilhelmwagen - While [Barrier Field] is deployed, you heal for 5% of the damage it mitigates and gain 30% Move Speed.To Me, My Friends! - While [Barrier Field] is deployed, allies within 5m are healed equal to 3% of your max Life every 1s.Amplification Barrier - Friendly projectiles that pass through your [Barrier Field] deal 15% more damage.Barrier Reconstruction - When you deal damage with [Rocket Hammer] or [Fire Strike], restore health to [Barrier Field] equal to 10% of its max Health.Vanguard - [Charge] grants nearby allies Overhealth equal to 10% of your max Life and 20% Move Speed for 3s.Shield Stampede - +50% [Charge] Knockback Power During [Charge], automatically deploy [Barrier Field].Vroom Boom Boom - During [Charge], colliding with a wall triggers an explosion that deals 30% of [Charge]'s pin damage.Impact Burst - [Fire Strike] triggers an explosion the first time it hits an enemy, dealing 20% of its damage in a 3m radius.Magma Strike - If [Fire Strike] is cast twice within 2s, the second strike leaves a trail of lava that Burns enemies for {0} of its damage.Blazing Blitz - After using [Earthshatter], every [Rocket Hammer] swing launches a [Fire Strike] for 4s.Items:Ironclad Cleats - +25 Armor, +5% Weapon Power, +40% Knockback ResistRocket Boots - +25 Health, holding crouch increases the height of your next jump by up to 200%Dampener Grip - +10% Ability Power, +10% Attack Speed, when you deal damage with [Rocket Hammer], reduce the cooldown of your abilities by 1sPlan Z - +10% Weapon Power, Gain 5% Attack Speed for every 100 missing Life, up to 25%Boost Recycler - +10% Ability Power, if [Charge] is interrupted by stun, sleep, or hinder, refund 50% of [Charge]'s cooldownCrusader's Cure - +25 Health, using [Charge] cleanses all negative effectsGryphon Glider - +25 Health, +10% Ability Lifesteal, you can now fly during [Charge]Overclocked Barrier - +25 Health, +20% Barrier Field Health, +20% [Barrier Field] SizeInfusion Generator - +25 Health, Increase [Barrier Field] Health by 100% of your max LifePhoenix Protocol - +50 Health, [Barrier Field] regenerates 50% faster and begins regenerating 50% sooner after being destroyedChimera's Maw - +10% Ability Power, +35% Fire Strike RadiusRocket Strike - +20% Ability Power, +50% Fire Strike Projectile SpeedReaperPowers:Revolving Ruin - Close-range [Hellfire Shotgun] hits grant {1} Attack Speed for {3}s, stacking up to {2} timesShrouded Shrapnel - Using [Wraith Form] increases the number of pellets per shot in your next magazine and its spreadDeath Step - After using [Shadow Step], cast [Death Blossom] for 1.5s with 50% reduced damageStrangle Step - After using [Shadow Step], double your Lifesteal for 3sSpirited To Slay - Eliminations reset your cooldownsBackstabber - After using an ability, your next shot deals additional damage over {1}s to enemies struck from behindWraith Renewal - While in [Wraith Form], restore your Life every 1sGhosted - While in [Wraith Form], passing through enemies slows their Move Speed and Attack SpeedSilent As The Grave - Your footsteps and [Shadow Step] are significantly quieterShared Siphon - [The Reaping] also heals the nearest ally by a portion of Reaper's damage dealtHarvest Fest - [Hellfire Shotgun] hits have a chance to spawn a Soul Globe.

This mode is drastically different from other Overwatch 2 game modes for a number of reasons. First, there is a limited pool of heroes, with only 18 to start, though more will be added in the future. Second, it\u0026#39;s a third-person game that takes place across several rounds, each consisting of shortened matches similar to Push. Lastly, and most importantly, it has new abilities and perks you buy in between rounds, allowing you to create unique builds of your hero.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAs a match unfolds, you\u0026#39;ll earn currency every round, and in between rounds, you gain access to the shop, where you can buy permanent upgrades for the rest of the match. Because of this new system, you are locked to the character you choose at the start of the match and cannot swap later, making this a massive change from other modes. For example, Soldier 76 has multiple powers he can choose from. One will briefly activate his ultimate after firing a Helix rocket, while a different power will increase his primary fire power by 0.5% for each continuous shot fired. These different powers and abilities can drastically change how a hero plays, creating a dynamic new competitive mode.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOver the course of a match, you can get up to six items, which can be sold at any point, and four powers, which you are stuck with once acquired. Below, we have listed every hero currently available in Stadium mode, along with their character-specific abilities and powers, followed by a list of universal items.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-item-position-url=\"#2\"\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1599/15997278/4479307-reinhardt.jpg\" alt=\"Reinhardt\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3\u003eReinhardt\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePowers\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSmashing!\u003c/strong\u003e -
