Fantasy Critic League – Like Fantasy Football, but for Video Games We ended up with a total of 10 teams entered, which feels like a good number.  We didn’t get past the number where the FCL FAQ seemed to think things might get unmanageable. At 11:00 Pacific time / 19:00 UTC I hit the button to randomize the draft order, which gave us the following result: Play Forever Mwahahaha Neutical Publishing Frabjous Day Enterprises Pretty Blue Fox Games Rodent Entertainment TAGN HQ Crash and Burn Games Slightly Scuffed Studios Hare Brained Schemes Rusty Shackleford Once that was set, I was presented with the button that started the draft, which I duly clicked and off we went. Two people joined me in the Discord voice channel, though there were some audio issues and I am not sure anybody heard me speak.  But that was fine, as there wasn’t much to say.  Everybody had setup the auto draft option, so on my pressing the button the draft ran off, unhindered by human intervention, as the Discord channel pinged 50 times in my ear, once for each pick. My watch list ended up being pretty well picked over by the time we were done, with the first 14 items out of 25 I had chosen being grabbed. The top 14 items on my watch list all taken I see that, despite my announcing it in the previous post, nobody snagged Civ VII from me.  So I have that going for me.  Now to see if it was a good bet.  It has the advantage of coming out next month, so I will have my answer soon. The league puts up a list of the ten closest upcoming releases as a reminder as to what is in play soon. The first 10 releases for the league so far Nintendo first party titles do pretty well on reviews, so Donkey Kong Country Returns HD could be a strong opener. Also, on completion of the draft, the game posts a projection as to people’s expected point totals given the current data. The initial standings estimate This should not be taken too seriously as it has, in my minimal experience, proven to be pretty flimsy.  And, of course, nobody has had a title ship yet, so we are all tied for first place currently. So is that it?  Do we just sit around and watch the scoreboard for the next twelve months? No, there are a couple of things you should do and any number of things you could do.  When in the league window the Player Actions section has a number of options. Player Actions You should, some time between now and November 1st get a counter bid picked.  A counter bid is a bet against a game being reviewed well or not shipping.  If you fail to make a counter bid, that will cost you -15 points for your final score.  If your counter bid reviews well, those points will count against you, but if it reviews below 70, the negative points will be added to your total. And if the title doesn’t ship or reviews at exactly 70, there is no impact on your score, positive or negative. You also have slots for four more picks.  You can make bids on titles.  You have a $100 budget to use in the league, so be careful about spending it all on one title. You can also drop a game from your list.  There is a limit on the number of games you can drop if they have a set ship date.  However, any title without a ship date can be dropped freely. You also have the ability to trade with other players.  I am not sure how that works, but we’ll see if it comes into play. How these actions work is that you queue them up before Thursday at 17:00 Pacific time / 20:00 Eastern time (Friday at 01:00 UTC) at which point all the pending transactions will be processed then announced by the Discord bot in the FCL channel. From that point until 17:00 Pacific time on Saturday, anybody else can bid on the titles that are in play, so you cannot sneak in a $1 bid easy peasey. Then at 17:00 Pacific time on Saturday all the transactions are resolved and the games are assigned to the winning bidders (or dropped or traded), the results are broadcast in the FCL Discord channel, and the bidding window opens again for the next week. If you want to get your lineup nailed down for the year right away, you can start bidding now.  If you want to keep your options open, there is no hurry to bid this week unless there is a title you want coming up soon. Finally, once a title ships there will often be a gap during which there is no score show for it while reviews come in.  Once the title gets the minimum number of reviews required, it will display a score, but that score can change as more reviews come in. The reviews used are compiled at Open Critic. There are more details about scoring in the Fantasy Critic FAQ. Anyway, we are off and running.  And once a league has done its draft, it is locked and nobody else can join.  So the rest of you will be spectators on this year long experiment.

time between now and November 1st get a counter bid picked.  A counter bid is a bet against a game being reviewed well or not shipping.  If you fail to make a counter bid, that will cost you -15 points for your final score.  If your counter bid reviews well, those points will count against you, but if it reviews below 70, the negative points will be added to your total.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if the title doesn’t ship or reviews at exactly 70, there is no impact on your score, positive or negative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou also have slots for four more picks.  You can make bids on titles.  You have a $100 budget to use in the league, so be careful about spending it all on one title.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also drop a game from your list.  There is a limit on the number of games you can drop if they have a set ship date.  However, any title without a ship date can be dropped freely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou also have the ability to trade with other players.  I am not sure how that works, but we’ll see if it comes into play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow these actions work is that you queue them up before Thursday at 17:00 Pacific time / 20:00 Eastern time (Friday at 01:00 UTC) at which point all the pending transactions will be processed then announced by the Discord bot in the FCL channel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom that point until 17:00 Pacific time on Saturday, anybody else can bid on the titles that are in play, so you cannot sneak in a $1 bid easy peasey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen at 17:00 Pacific time on Saturday all the transactions are resolved and the games are assigned to the winning bidders (or dropped or traded), the results are broadcast in the FCL Discord channel, and the bidding window opens again for the next week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want to get your lineup nailed down for the year right away, you can start bidding now.  If you want to keep your options open, there is no hurry to bid this week unless there is a title you want coming up soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, once a title ships there will often be a gap during which there is no score show for it while reviews come in.  Once the title gets the minimum number of reviews required, it will display a score, but that score can change as more reviews come in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reviews used are compiled at \u003ca href=\"https://opencritic.com/\"\u003eOpen Critic\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are more details about scoring in the Fantasy Critic FAQ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, we are off and running.  And once a league has done its draft, it is locked and nobody else can join.  So the rest of you will be spectators on this year long experiment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit: You can \u003ca
