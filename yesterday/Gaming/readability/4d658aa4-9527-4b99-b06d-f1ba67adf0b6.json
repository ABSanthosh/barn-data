EventsHow To Evolve GimmighoulCan Gimmighoul Be ShinyHow To Get GimmighoulAside from trading, there are two main methods of getting Gimmighoul in Pokemon Go. The first involves the Coin Bag, an item you receive after connecting the mobile game with Pokemon Scarlet or Violet, while the second is to simply wait for the Pokemon to appear during special events.1. Coin BagLike Meltan, Gimmighoul typically only appears in Pokemon Go after you use a specific item, in this case the Coin Bag.To receive one, you must connect your Pokemon Go account to Pokemon Scarlet or Violet for Nintendo Switch and then send a postcard from the mobile game to the title you paired with. Once you've completed this step, the Coin Bag will be added to your inventory.Just as the Mystery Box, the Coin Bag will only work for a limited time. After you open it, Roaming Form Gimmighoul will spawn in the wild for 30 minutes, giving you a brief window to catch as many as you can. Once the 30 minutes have elapsed, the Coin Bag will close, and you'll need to wait one day and send another postcard before you can open it again.2. EventsIn addition to the Coin Bag, Gimmighoul will occasionally appear during special events, such as the Ninth Anniversary Party currently underway from July 1-6.A Gimmighoul with a special coin is appearing during Pokemon Go's ninth anniversary event.Among the various rewards you can earn for completing Field and Timed Research tasks during this event are chances to catch Gimmighoul. Unlike other Gimmighoul, the ones you encounter here may be holding a special Ninth Anniversary coin, making them especially rare.How To Evolve GimmighoulWhereas most Pokemon require a certain number of candies to evolve, Gimmighoul instead requires coins--and a lot of them.Gimmighoul can evolve into Gholdengo after you've amassed a whopping 999 Gimmighoul Coins. You can collect these coins in a few different ways, such as by catching wild Gimmighoul and spinning PokeStops that are set with Golden Lure Modules. You'll also earn coins by walking with Gimmighoul set as your buddy.Since Gimmighoul coins are typically hard to come by, it will likely take a while to collect enough needed to evolve one into Gholdengo. However, the Ninth Anniversary Party event is making it a little easier to get your hands on them. When you spin a PokeStop that's set with a Golden Lure Module, you'll have a chance to find nine, 99, or even more Gimmighoul coins, so you'll want to take advantage of this bonus if you're hoping to get a Gholdengo.Can Gimmighoul Be ShinyAlthough not every Pokemon comes in a shiny variant yet, Gimmighoul does, and it's very easy to tell it apart from the standard version.While typical Gimmighoul have silvery bodies, shiny Gimmighoul is white, so you can immediately tell at a glance if you've found a shiny or not. Shiny Gholdengo is much harder to tell apart, however; its body color remains the same, but it's accented with blue lines instead of red.As mentioned, Pokemon Go's Ninth Anniversary Party runs until July 6. Once it's over, you'll need to rely on the Coin Bag to catch more Gimmighoul, so you don't want to miss your chance to get the Coin Hunter Pokemon while you can.
