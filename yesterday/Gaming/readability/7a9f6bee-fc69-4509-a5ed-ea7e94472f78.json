  "text": "Another day, another Nintendo Switch 2 leak - this time pertaining to images that purport to be of a Joy-Con for Nintendo's Switch successor. As Tom reported a little while back, we've had a fair idea what Switch 2 will look like for a while - at least since a prototype console shell and internal components surfaced online in late September. But recent weeks have seen further images posted, this time by accessory companies now taking orders for Switch 2 add-ons, which show close estimations for Nintendo's next console in greater detail. The 20 best Switch games money can buy - 2022 UPDATE - How many do YOU own? The 20 best Switch games money can buy - How many do YOU own?Watch on YouTube Now we have brand-new images of what's reported to be the new generation of Joy-Con controllers with magnetic Joy-Con attachments and an additional button below Home on the right Joy-Con. Reportedly originating from China, the Joy-Con shows off its new magnetic attachment as well as revised colour palette which differs from existing Joy-Cons. If the images are authentic - and right now, there is no proof - it looks like we can also expect enlarged SL and SR buttons, too, and maybe even a mouse-like optical sensor. You can check the photos out yourself in the X post above or in the subreddit thread embedded below: New Alleged Switch 2 Joy-Con Photos Shared from Chinese SNS byu/thisSubIsAtrocious inGamingLeaksAndRumoursIf the images are not fake and do indeed originate from a Chinese factory that's manufacturing the new machines (apparently, the Joy-Con has a system serial number that is allegedly validated by Nintendo's Check Warranty page), it seems increasingly unlikely Nintendo will exceed its self-imposed deadline of 31st March 2025 to show off its Switch successor. When it does arrive, fans expect next year's long-awaited blockbuster Metroid Prime 4 to launch on Nintendo's new hardware. Nintendo has also confirmed that Switch 2 will be backwards compatible.",
