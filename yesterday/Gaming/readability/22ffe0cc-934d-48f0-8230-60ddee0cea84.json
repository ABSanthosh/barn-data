  "text": "The Razer Enki X is a great chair to get if you want to save cash on a good gaming chair.There are certain things in life you should never skimp on: beds, toilet paper, and desk chairs, to name a few. We spend so much of our lives sitting down at our desks, so it is important to get a chair that supports us properly. That said, you don't need to take out a loan or buy a super high-end ergonomic chair or office chair (unless that's what you're looking for) to be comfortable all day. There are plenty of chairs made for gamers specifically, and one of our top picks right now is the Razer Enki X.We recently updated our list of the best budget gaming chairs, and the Razer Enki X won the title of 'most comfortable gaming chair.' The Enki X is a good chair even at full price, but now you can save $100 as part of Amazon's Black Friday sale.Razer Enki X Gaming Chair for $299 at RazerIGN's most comfortable gaming chair on a budgetRazer Enki X Gaming ChairThis model provides a lumbar curve that gently supports your lower back and encourages sitting in a neutral position. Ideal for all-day gaming.Note: this chair is out of stock on Amazon as of 11/28. You can still get it on sale at Razer.com. One of the best things about the Razer Enki X is that it's easy to put together, only taking a few minutes to assemble when it arrives (I always hate spending tons of time before I can enjoy my things). It can tilt from 90 to 160 degrees, and the seat can adjust in height from 17.7-21.6\". It's got built-in lumbar support, which is going to come in handy for longer gaming sessions at your desk. It sports a mixture of faux leather and fabric so it breathes well, too.While the upgraded Razer Enki is the focus of our full review, we also mentioned the Enki X among our best gaming chairs list. The only difference between the Enki and Enki X is that the latter doesn't come with a magnetic neck pillow, and the functionality of the armrests is more limited. The Razer Enki has armrests which can be moved forward or back, heightened or lowered, and even have the angle adjusted. With the Enki X, you can only move them up or down in their fixed position. Not a huge deal, but something to consider. The big brother Enki is also on sale on Amazon, but the discount isn't nearly as good.Razer Enki PhotosIs It Worth Buying at This Price?Yes, it's a good time to get the Razer Enki X. Gaming chairs typically go for several hundred dollars, but they aren't all made of quality components (the Enki X has a metal frame that supports up to 300 pounds), they aren't all comfortable (this model got our award for comfort), and without going to a physical store, it's hard to get a sense of whether it's even a good chair or not. Personally, I wouldn't even use the magnetic pillow or the fancy armrests on the more expensive Enki (as I type this, I'm not even using my own armrests), so getting the less expensive Enki X would be my move. Knocking $100 off that already decent price puts it firmly in the 'good decision' camp, but you need to decide how important those extra features are to you. If you don't want to spend this much even with the sale price in mind, there are even less expensive options below, but I would say it's easily worth spending at least $150 in order to get a solid chair.
