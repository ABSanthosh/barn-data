What’s the oldest thing in your makeup bag right now? Hmm, the brushes? Oh, and I’m almost embarrassed to say this out loud, but I have an ancient Nordstrom Naturals MAC palette that I bust out every so often. 3. How’s your June going so far? It’s been very, very busy with end-of-the-year activities, dance things and whatnot. Things will kinda slow down after June 30, which I’m looking forward to. 4.

I like my toe nails to be painted a fun color, but I don’t stress if I don’t get around to a weekly pedicure. 5. What are you happy about right now? Well, today’s my birthday, and I’m overjoyed to say that I’m healthy and I’m alive! Having health scares will do that to ya, I guess. I’m also happy to be surrounded by the people I love the most. Oh, and the opportunity to do something creative that’s just for me (like the Monday poll) is the icing on the cake. I’ve been on the verge of happy tears all day. It’s been a great! Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S. Here are the questions to copy/paste with your answers in a comment. Talk to ya soon. 1. Loose or fitted t-shirts? 2.
