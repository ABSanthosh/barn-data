  "text": "Dragon Age: The Veilguard's launch has already made it EA's biggest ever single-player game on Steam, topping the charts and beating out the concurrents for 2023's Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. At the time of publication, Dragon Age: The Veilguard's peak was about 70,414 concurrents, putting it just outside the top 10 most played games on the platform with mostly positive reviews. It sits one spot ahead of Baldur's Gate 3, which continues to enjoy ongoing success thanks to the introduction of mods and other new features. EA previous high watermark was Jedi Survivor, which managed an all-time peak of 67,855.EA CEO Andrew Wilson predicted success for Dragon Age during Tuesday's earnings call, saying that BioWare had \"returned to its strengths,\" and that it would be benefit from limited competition thanks to Ubisoft's decision to delay Assassin's Creed Shadows. We wrote in our own review, \"Dragon Age: The Veilguard refreshes and reinvigorates a storied series that stumbled through its middle years, and leaves no doubt that it deserves its place in the RPG pantheon. The next Mass Effect is going to have a very tough act to follow, which is not something I ever imagined I'd be saying before I got swept away on this adventure.\"Every IGN BioWare Game ReviewOverall it's a solid start for BioWare's new RPG given that it launched on a day when most of its fans are either at work or in school. It'll be worth keeping an eye on its performance heading into its first full weekend as players properly dig into the first new Dragon Age release since 2014.For more, check out our guide to Dragon Age: The Veilguard's major choices and consequences as well as our romance guide.
