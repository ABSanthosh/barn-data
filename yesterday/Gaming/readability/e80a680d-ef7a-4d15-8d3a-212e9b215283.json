  "text": "The Site Another October.  Not that October is bad.  But it is kind of the gateway month before the holidays.  August saw a lot of traffic, there was a dip in September, then things have started to build up this past month promising a good holiday season. Does that matter?  Probably not.  I mean, I like when there is more traffic, but I also adjust and re-normalize when there is not.  We’re not going back to 2012 numbers.  Not ever.  Blogs and MMORPGs are both beyond that level of popularity, and blogs about MMORPGS… forget about it. Page views for TAGN by full year But, the end of the year could shape up to beat 2020, the pandemic peak of the blog when both blogs and MMORPGs had a brief revival.  That would make me a little bit happy… and seems pretty achievable with even a modest uptick in traffic. The other thing that the holidays bring are quality ads.  Ad quality counts when it comes to getting paid.  I can look at the stats and see days that served up nearly the same number of ads and one will be nearly four dollars and the other will be sixteen cents, and the difference is all in the quality of the ads being served. Not that I write the blog as a money making venture.  But I like to make enough to pay the WordPress.com hosting for this site and for EVE Online Pictures, where I ironically pay just enough so that WP.com won’t show ads. As always, I recommend you, the regular reader, visit this site with ad block enabled.  I prefer uBlock Origin, running on Firefox, for my web viewing experience as that keeps all the most heinous stuff at bay. (Google, taking yet another step towards evil, is breaking ad block in Chrome because a company that makes most of its revenue from web ads is unsurprisingly annoyed about people blocking those ads. ) My plan is to make money from comment spam bots, which appear to actually load the UI (and thus the ads) and random strangers from Google search. Also, as a side note, with this post I will exceed the 472K words I spewed out onto the blog during all of 2023, which was the peak of my verbosity up to that point, and I still have two months to go in 2024.  Maybe I need to rediscover the 500 word essay.  I am averaging close to 1,500 words a post so far. One Year Ago EverQuest, EverQuest II, and Lord of the Rings Online all put their new expansions up for pre-order. I was trying to plot our what Ji Ham meant when he said he wanted to make the planned new EverQuest title difficult like Elden Ring. New World launched the Angry Earth expansion, their first since the troubled launch of the title. In EVE Online I had one of those days where we just sat on the titan and waited.  EVE also saw the return of the Crimson Harvest event, with Twitch Drops now part of the mix. I looked at destruction in the MER, which included all the hulls blown up in the new Zarzakh system/region.  I was also pondering EVE Vanguard. Reavers turned 9 years old.  Also, GM week showed up where they announced they were running short of bots to bash.  When you make capitals too expensive to undock the results are predictable.  But they had enough in set aside for one final bot bash in Yulai.  Titans with retired GM names were exploded. Wrath Classic gave us Brewfest, so we returned to face Coren Direbrew as we had so many times in the past.  We also got the Fall of the Lich King update for Wrath Classic, bringing us to the end of its content, save for Ruby Sanctum. Then came Hallow’s End and my decade plus search for the mount of the Headless Horseman.  There were some issues due to the unified pets and dungeon finder.  Blizz did fix my Sinister Squashling issue after a week.  But after all of that, I finally got that damn mount! We also went in and faced the Forge of Souls and the Pit of Saron, but came up short in the Halls of Reflection. I also did a Friday Bullet Points round up of Blizzard topics about the upcoming BlizzCon, BlizzCon stuff for sale, the Lich King showing up to Wrath Classic at last, Joyous Journeys, Addon breakage, the unified pets and mounts added to Wrath Classic, and then posted the next day about Microsoft acquisition finally closing.  All the layoffs would come later, but at least Bobby Kotick was slated to be out the door by January 1st. Oh, then Diablo IV landed on Steam and got review bombed. In Pokemon Go I was wondering if I was going to get in enough excellent throws to finish the master ball event in time.  Then I read up on how to make excellent throws and got it done… and then Niantic nerfed that and made them difficult again. In Baldur’s Gate 3 Potshot and I were facing Minthara then the last goblin boss before heading back to the druids. My Telephone Tales series went on about dominating the PowerBook modem market, witnessing the death of eWorld, the great dial tone drought of 96, and the peak and decline of the modem business for Global Village. I reviewed Elon’s first year of wrecking Twitter.  Things got even worse later on. Finally, we did a bit of autumnal binge watching. Five Years Ago BlizzCon was coming, so I spent some time speculating about what I wanted to see and what I thought we might actually get.  There was a lot in play.  Blizzard was also talking about WoW Classic and getting realms down to a single layer.  Layering carried on, but Dire Maul was added to the game.  Also free transfers and Hallow’s End. And then the whole Blitzchung thing happened, casting a pall overBlizzCon and making #boycottblizzard the theme of the day.  Blizzard then took a few days to finally respond officially, and their response pleased nobody. In WoW Classic we carried on, exploring the Ogre area in Loch Modan and starting our first run into the Deadmines, which became a two part post, with the follow up about getting to Van Cleef.  From there it was off to wander the Wailing Caverns.  We also did the running of the gnomes event.  Ula made a video about it. Over at Daybreak it was time for more layoffs.  But Holly was on the EverQuest Show to talk about the game, expansions were announced, special servers were discussed, and there were still custom UI issues, all summed up in one bullet points post.   The pre-orders for EverQuest Torment of Velious were live. Meanwhile, it was declared that PlanetSide Arena was just a stepping stone to PlanetSide 3. CCP brought back the Skilling Spree event to EVE Online, which let you earn skill points by completing a daily task.  They were also straight up giving away skill points again.  Many skill points were there to claim. The October update expanded the Triglavian invasion and updated the tutorial.  They also raised warp speeds on some ships to help us get around New Eden.  We also got a Halloween event and the howling interceptors update. More importantly, the meeting minutes from the first CSM14 summit were released, in which CCP laid out its top four priorities for the game.  I couldn’t decide if “fix the stupid” was okay as the second item or if it covered so much stuff that we might never get to the third.  Certainly the MER showed that the “Chaos Era” might have fallen under that.  And I was wondering if gating missions behind standings was falling into that as well. Of course, it isn’t a real CSM if somebody doesn’t step down or get kicked.  This time Killah Bee dropped out and Sort Dragon returned to the CSM in his place.  Meanwhile, there was always somebody out there ready to take CCP at their worst. It was also time for the annual vision quest to EVE Vegas.  We learned about many things, like Team Talos and plans and what not.  We also learned that this would be the last CCP sponsored EVE Vegas event. Out in space, the Reavers deployment was out looking for things to shoot.  When in doubt, shoot structures.  That’s the way we roll.  But that wasn’t panning out, so we took a wormhole back home and were in Delve before the Reavers turned five. Meanwhile, Liberty Squad was still out as well, and we took a fight in FDZ. And, finally, Raph Koster announced his new venture, Playable Worlds, while Mike O’Brien, formerly of ArenaNet, announced his new venture, ManaWorks.  Daybreak also released the EverQuest and EverQuest II sound tracks for purchase on most major platforms.  All of this was covered in yet another bullet points post. Ten Years Ago The SF Giants won the World Series for the third time in five years.  I was just happy when they won it once in my lifetime.  Of course, they haven’t done much in the time since, but I had my moment… three times! I was wondering about guild progression and whether they should have levels. I was disappointed at Trion installing HackShield on my system and only deigning to notify me of this after the fact.  That got their Glyph launcher off my system. EA put a new twist on insta-level by introducing a limited 12x experience bonus offer that would essentially let Star Wars: The Old Republic players level up via just their class story, without indulging in the myriad side quests the process would otherwise require.  Basically, you could play just the good bits of the game.  Imagine that! The strategy group was doing city assaults, river crossings, and ambushes in Total War: Rome II. At EVE Vegas there were development plans for the coming year, which included Tech III destroyers.  Jump fatigue was also announced.  But at least we were also getting a much longer skill queue. (Limited to 50 skills or ten years of training, whichever you reach first.)  That was much on my mind as I crossed the 130 million skill point mark. The Reavers, a group within The Imperium dedicated to living in hostile territory and attacking enemy infrastructure, was formed.  Our inaugural operations went to Insmother , where we blew up plenty of stuff, and then went to Feythabolis. Closer to home there was a capital brawl in our staging system.  That was part of some battles with Black Legion, where they would visit us and then we would visit them.  Or blob them.  I also experienced one of the classic EVE mistakes for the first time.  People seemed anxious to use their capital ships before the Phoebe expansion changed everything. In World of Warcraft I summed up my summer campaign for the Loremaster achievement.  It was not a success.  I did get my Sha’tari Skyguard reputation to exalted though.  More mounts! Meanwhile, the WoW 6.0 patch dropped and the count-down to Warlords of Draenor began in earnest.  I was looking at the new features in that.  The instance group also stirred in anticipation of the new expansion, mostly finishing off Mists of Pandaria. Finally, Planetary Annihilation arrived at last, and proved once again that recreating past fun isn’t as easy as it should be. Fifteen Years Ago League of Legends launched, going on to become the most successful rip-off of Defense of the Acients MOBA, topping online gaming revenue charts and spawning a long chain of failed copy cats.  I still don’t get the appeal of the game or its genre. Torchlight came out, giving a lot of people a Diablo-like injection of fun.  It didn’t have a lot of replay value for me.  Once I burned through the game once I was pretty much done, which made it unlike Diablo II, to which I returned a number of times.  But it was just $20 and gave us a taste of what Runic might be able to deliver going forward. I was on a MUD history kick, with tales of exciting ways to die in Kobold Village, the Kobold Temple of the Unholy, getting lost in the Faerie Forest, and all the rooms in TorilMUD. It was also the three year anniversary of the regular Saturday night instance group, and I presented a summary of what we had done. A couple of us scouted the then newly Free to Play Dungeons \u0026 Dragons Online as a possible next game for the instance group, but it didn’t stick. I was able to buy the Adventurer’s Pack for Lord of the Rings Online and get the Siege of Mirkwood expansion for free.  Not as good of a deal as monthly subscribers got I understand, but a decent deal.  Of course, LOTRO has changed a lot since then. In World of Warcraft October that year saw me finish off both the Brewfest and Hallow’s End meta achievements.  I was still left with one achievement for each holiday though.  Fun was had with pumpkins and the Headless Horseman. The instance group returned to Utgarde Keep to take on Utgarde Pinnacle, at that time the last five-person dungeon in Northrend.  We were victorious and gained the Northrend Dungeonmaster achievement.  But otherwise we were deciding on where the group should go next. And Blizzard was busy merging everybody’s WoW account into a Battle.new account because… well, it wasn’t because of better security. Twenty Years Ago The first Star Wars Galaxies expansion, Jump to Lightspeed, was launched, adding space combat to the game. Thirty Five Years Ago Prince of Persia is launched for the Apple II. It later becomes a hit and kicks off a franchise when ported to other, less dying platforms. Maxis launched SimCity, which was a big success, but which led to people at the time to argue about whether it was really a game since you could not necessarily “win” it.  There is always some Tobold-like pedant out there with a bad faith “Well akshully…” argument.

EVE Online – 67.90% WoW Classic – 23.65% Stars Reach – 4.16% Combat Mission:BB – 1.99% EverQuest – 1.89% World of Warcraft – 0.41% The move to Tenerifis and covering ops and a bit of Crimson Harvest explains that for the most part.  WoW Classic… that faded some, especially at the start of the month.  But there was some Wintergrasp and such in there.  Stars Reach was play tests, and the rest were short bits… the time for WoW was what it took me to get to the 20th anniversary celebration and do the first few quests before leaving retail. EVE Online Move ops!  That was pretty much my focus for October, packing up all my stuff in Delve and getting it to Tenerifis or Jita.  I mean, look at the time I spent in here relative to other titles. Sure, there was also Crimson Harvest, about which I will soon have a post, and I did fiddle with that some, though mostly from anxiety to be in the game because of the move.  I’ll have a post about that event soon.  But mostly it was move op stuff. EverQuest I just entered what will probably be the last cycle of my Daybreak subscription, since all I have been doing for the last three months is play the Overseer in EQ.  Sure, I now have a level 112 druid through that minimal effort, up from level 100, but will I play him ever, for real?  Very unlikely. Pokemon Go Made some pretty decent progress towards level 47.  The whole Dynamax thing hasn’t done anything for either of us, so it is just the usual plodding along, catching Pokemon, spinning Pokestops, and leveling up with friends.  I do have one task that looks like it will be blocking me from level 47, but I’ll crank out a post on that. Level: 46 (level, 79% of the way to 47, 2 of 4 tasks complete) Pokedex status: 852 (+1) caught, 863 (+1) seen Vivillon Evolutions obtained: 18 of 18! Pokemon I want: Some missing ones from the older Pokedexes Current buddy: Gyarados because I need candies Stars Reach I was in on 2.5 play tests this month… there was a quick, weekday evening one after the combat/ranger test… and was invited to join another pair of mid-week tests, but one was on Tuesday, which was “popcorn for dinner movie night” with my wife and the other is tonight.  Who sets up a play test on Halloween night?  What is wrong with people? WoW Classic We took a shot at some heroics, but mostly just mucked around with Wintergrasp.  When Joyous Journeys hit, I decided to level up one more alt… and then they took it away when the Firelands update hit, so that put an end to that.  We’re kind of drifting here and only have like five more months of this to go. Coming Up Well, there are the WoW and EQII 20th anniversaries landing next month.  That will be kind of a big deal.  I might have to log into both, which is something I have not done a lot of this year. LOTRO and EQII should be set to launch their annual expansions. (EQ will hit in December.) In EVE Online the move ops will continue as we settle into our new home… and then the Revenant expansion will be landing on us.  At least we can probably count on that including 7 days of free omega time. I also feel like I need to drag something out of my library to try.  Too much WoW Classic and EVE Online can get a bit stale. Oh, and there is an election on Tuesday here, which might well decide the fate of democracy in the US, where a fairly normal politician is running against a very old convicted felon who promises to destroy the government, crash the economy, deport immigrants legal or not, free convicted violent criminals, and hold military tribunals to prosecute his political enemies… and it is a tight race.  I mean, I have always allowed that the general public was unable to recognize its own self-interest, but when I turn on the TV and see Cletus telling some reporter that inflation was bad so he’s voting for the felon, I feel like maybe the country is just so dumb that we’re going to get what we deserve. We’ll see on Tuesday I guess.  Sorry to the rest of the world in advance and screw this up.",

people?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWoW Classic\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe took a shot at some heroics, but mostly just mucked around with Wintergrasp.  When Joyous Journeys hit, I decided to level up one more alt… and then they took it away when the Firelands update hit, so that put an end to that.  We’re kind of drifting here and only have like five more months of this to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eComing Up\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, there are the \u003cem\u003eWoW\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eEQII\u003c/em\u003e 20th anniversaries landing next month.  That will be kind of a big deal.  I might have to log into both, which is something I have not done a lot of this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eLOTRO\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eEQII\u003c/em\u003e should be set to launch their annual expansions. (\u003cem\u003eEQ\u003c/em\u003e will hit in December.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e the move ops will continue as we settle into our new home… and then the Revenant expansion will be landing on us.  At least we can probably count on that including 7 days of free omega time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also feel like I need to drag something out of my library to try.  Too much \u003cem\u003eWoW Classic\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e can get a bit stale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, and there is an election on Tuesday here, which might well decide the fate of democracy in the US, where a fairly normal politician is running against a very old convicted felon who promises to destroy the government, crash the economy, deport immigrants legal or not, free convicted violent criminals, and hold military tribunals to prosecute his political enemies… and it is a tight race.  I mean, I have always allowed that the general public was unable to recognize its own self-interest, but when I turn on the TV and see Cletus telling some reporter that inflation was bad so he’s voting for the felon, I feel like maybe the country is just so dumb that we’re going to get what we deserve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ll see on Tuesday I guess.  Sorry to the rest of the world in advance and screw this up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
