  "text": "Both are well under $2,000! Image credit: AMD, PowerColor, Nvidia and ASUS Amazon Prime Day isn't just for smartwatches and air fryers. It's a goldmine for gamers this year, and I couldn’t resist weighing up a PC build . I dove into the discounts (Don't forget that free 30-day Prime trial) and built two monster gaming rigs. One powered by Nvidia’s brand-new RTX 5070 and another fueled by AMD’s scorching Radeon 9070XT. I've put components together around the two GPU's I could find in Prime Deals and worked from there, so a budget of below $2,000 was kept in mind throughout. Let's get into it: Total Cost (Before Prime Day) Nvidia RTX 5070 Build: $1,929.96 AMD Radeon 9070XT Build: $1,875.35 Total Cost (After Prime Day) Nvidia RTX 5070 Build: $1,643.23 AMD Radeon 9070XT Build: $1,510.26 Let’s break down each build, the deals, and why now is the perfect time to sort out your own fully operational battlestation: AMD Radeon 9070XT Build This beast is built for 4K domination with next-gen performance and ultra-smooth visuals thanks to HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 2.1 support. Its dual 8-pin PCIe connectors demand hefty power, but the 16GB of GDDR6 memory delivers visuals that'll make your eyeballs weep with joy. Grab it while it’s under $750. Ryzen 5 7600X delivers elite-level gaming with 6 cores and clock speeds up to 5.3GHz. Pairing it with MSI’s Wi-Fi-ready motherboard gives you PCIe 4.0-ready sockets, DDR5 support, and future-proofing headroom in years to come. If you're running DDR4 in 2025, it's time to upgrade. This DDR5 kit boosts game load times and frame rates and plays nice with both AMD EXPO and Intel XMP 3.0. Smooth, silent, and stylish. This 360mm AIO keeps temps down even when your GPU is pushing ultra settings at 144 FPS. Samsung's 990 EVO Plus brings up to 7,250MB/s speeds and superb thermal control. Big storage. Big speed. Big win. Dual-chamber cooling, ARGB lighting, and four pre-installed fans make this flash case ideal for showing off that beast of a GPU. It doesn't break the bank and comes with fans that won't sound like an aircraft carrier. ATX 3.1 ready with PCIe 5.1 support and semi-passive cooling, this PSU is future-proof and whisper quiet. Nvidia RTX 5070 Build Powered by Nvidia's Blackwell architecture and DLSS 4, this card is a ray-tracing powerhouse. Military-grade components, massive triple axial-tech fans, and a slick protective PCB coating give you elite performance with next-level durability. Yes, same killer combo as the AMD build. Because it's a cracking deal. DDR5 support, PCIe 5.0, Wi-Fi 6E, and buttery-smooth CPU power for high-FPS gaming. Fast, reliable, and fully compatible with both AMD and Intel systems. This kit is the sweet spot for gaming performance in 2025. It's just a shame they don't have cheeky RGB strips This cooler has it all: triple high-speed fans, a 2.4-inch IPS LCD screen, and superb thermal performance. It’s cheap, cheerful, and cool as hell. If you fancy the Radeon build above, this cooler would also be compatible as we're using the same processor. Crucial's Gen4 SSD serves up 7,100MB/s read speeds and comes bundled with Acronis software. Lightning fast, wallet friendly. I use one of these for extra game storage, so I know it's good. This is the RTX 5070’s throne. With support for E-ATX, triple radiators, and vertical GPU mounting, it’s built to flex. ATX 3.1, PCIe 5.1-ready, flat cables, and gold certified. This thing is built to handle next-gen GPUs with zero fuss.",
