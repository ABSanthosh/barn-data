While it was brief, it did reveal a fresh look at the game's primary villain, the Timekeeper, his minions, and franchise punching bag Claptrap. Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S--with a Switch 2 version coming at a later date--and the base version of the game is priced at $70. With its launch date drawing closer, Gearbox has been revealing more details on the game, and how it's building on the Borderlands foundation with a seamless world to explore, dynamic events to take part in, and an overhauled drop-rate for weapons that will make legendary-class feel special again.Another big change in Borderlands 4 is its tone, as Gearbox wants the humor in the game to be more grounded.
