Lord of the Rings Online The schedule, as previously posted, went as follows. Wednesday, May 28th: Firefoot (US) Silverlode (US) Maiar (EU) Estel (EU) Thursday, May 29th: Vilya (US) Imladris (US) Anduin (EU) Withywindle (EU) Friday, May 30th: Dwarrowdelf (US) Meneldor (US) Snowbourn (EU) Morthond (EU) Monday, June 2nd: Nimrodel (US) Windfola (US) Gilrain (EU) Vanyar (EU) Tuesday, June 3rd: Elendilmir (US) Riddermark (US) Eldar (EU) Judging from the history of the blog, it seemed like I might have characters on as many as four of those servers.  The question was, should I bother with transferring them? As it turned out, the issue didn’t materialize until the next to last round of servers.  I either transferred of deleted the characters I had on Firefoot and Silverlode, and it turned out I had just one character left behind on Nimrodel, a level 39 dwarf rune-keeper.  It was easy enough to transfer over that one character to see what they had. But then I got to Windfola, the server where we started out playing back at launch, where our first kinship was formed in the early days of the game.  I had six characters there. My server list in the transfer window Six seemed like quite a load of characters and, since they were on a dark server, I couldn’t log in and see what class or level they were or whether they had anything of value.  All you get is a list of names. My character list on Windfola What that mostly told me was I tend to re-use the same names over and over again.  Chances were high that Nomu was a dwarf guardian and Tistann was a hunter. I was somewhat reluctant to bother pulling the trigger on that transfer.  But SSG gave us a lot of character slots on the new 64-bit servers so, after some encouragement, I pulled the trigger on the transfer… mostly out of curiousity.  While the transfer window is too constrained to read the full dates, Nomu was last played in August of some distant year no doubt and I mostly recall his bags being completely full, a common situation in LOTRO when you’ve been around this long.  They just put another anniversary gift in your bags every year. I will say, however, that the transfer process is now working smoothly.  Once I pressed the button I got the message that the transfers were under way. Transfers under way And, unlike the initial transfer to Glamdring, I not only got the confirmation email as promised, it arrived in just a few minutes.  I suspect we’re just past the mass rush to transfer to the 64-bit servers, so things are working as expected now.  But I was still happy to get the receipt so quickly. Windfola transfers complete Of the six characters transferred, two were in the tutorial still so I deleted them right away.  Tistann-2, a level 3 hunter, wasn’t bringing much value. The highest level character was Nomu-1, a dwarf guardian as expected, who was level 34… and I am here to say that it took a long time to get to level 34 back then.  Early LOTRO advancement was very slow, in part because the level 40-50 content wasn’t done by the time the game went live, so they had to keep us busy somehow.  Anyway, he was sitting out there in Esteldin, right where I left him back when our first group faded and we went back to WoW. I did get burned on my shared storage.  In bringing over that server and all the shared items, I managed to over stuff the shared storage on Glamdring.  I had to get in there and pull stuff out and then buy two storage upgrades to get that under control.  But I have a lot of LOTRO points sitting around… which I mostly use on storage upgrades. It always comes down to inventory management.  But I’ll have a whole post about that at some point. All my characters are now consolidated on three active servers, with most of them on Glamdring.  We’ll see if I end up doing anything with most of them.  My forward motion on my latest run of the game has been, in part, due to my ability to resist running off to work on alts or crafting or any of the other side tasks.

Glamdring, I not only got the confirmation email as promised, it arrived in just a few minutes.  I suspect we’re just past the mass rush to transfer to the 64-bit servers, so things are working as expected now.  But I was still happy to get the receipt so quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_135608\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

away.  Tistann-2, a level 3 hunter, wasn’t bringing much value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe highest level character was Nomu-1, a dwarf guardian as expected, who was level 34… and I am here to say that it took a long time to get to level 34 back then.  Early \u003cem\u003eLOTRO\u003c/em\u003e advancement was very slow, in part because the level 40-50 content wasn’t done by the time the game went live, so they had to keep us busy somehow.  Anyway, he was sitting out there in Esteldin, right where I left him back when our first group faded and we went back to \u003cem\u003eWoW\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did get burned on my shared storage.  In bringing over that server and all the shared items, I managed to over stuff the shared storage on Glamdring.  I had to get in there and pull stuff out and then buy two storage upgrades to get that under control.  But I have a lot of LOTRO points sitting around… which I mostly use on storage upgrades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt always comes down to inventory management.  But I’ll have a whole post about that at some point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll my characters are now consolidated on three active servers, with most of them on Glamdring.  We’ll see if I end up doing anything with most of them.  My forward motion on my latest run of the game has been, in part, due to my ability to resist running off to work on alts or crafting or any of the other side tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelated:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSSG – \u003ca
