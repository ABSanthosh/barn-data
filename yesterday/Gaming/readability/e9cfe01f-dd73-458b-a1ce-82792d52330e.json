  "text": "Marketplace Written By Julius Olofsson Published 1/21/25 Hello Kitty® Is Here! Time to build your kawaii farm ハローキティが登場！   Oh, I’m sorry about the Japanese, I simply got too excited! But – surprise! – it says, “Hello Kitty is here!” so let's put on our red bows!  The Hello Kitty and Friends DLC by Razzleberries and Sanrio® is a farming simulator that puts the “adorable” in farming, so I guess it’s a farmadorable simulator, then?  Enter the loveable world of Hello Kitty where you can meet new friends, explore the quaint and loveable town and take on quests where you can earn gifts (gifts!!).  But most importantly, you can build, and manage your own farm, with all it entails, such as planting crops and taking care of your animals.  Every Day Is a New Adventure Your farm is YOUR farm, and you build it as you see fit! Some of us simply loooove eggs, while others prefer to feast on veggies, and some love blue as others lean more towards pink.  Here’s some of what you can do:  Crops: There are plenty of crops for you to plant, grow, and harvest, but you’ll need to water them daily (especially if it’s a hot summer’s day, but we’ll get into that in a bit).  Animals: You can’t run a farm without animals, well you can but it’s not as cute. Besides darling chickens, cows, and sheep that will provide you with eggs, milk, and wool, there are also pigs that can find truffles that are worth a lot.  Decor: And this is almost the best part – you can decorate your farm with over 180 different Hello Kitty-themed furniture and decor, such as the Badtz-maru™ chair or the Tuxedosam™ Table.  Keep Going, No Matter the Storms The Hello Kitty and Friends DLC comes with changing seasons and as these change, you’ll discover a magical, shifting world with blooming flowers in spring, a bright sun for summer, wondrous foliage during fall, and a winter covered with crisp, white snow.  Each season also comes with its own exciting and delightful seasonal event. I mean, who doesn’t want to attend any of these intriguing and pun-tastic get-togethers: the Eggciting Cherry Blossom Festival, Frosty Funday, the Halloween Spooktacular or the Fireworks Festival?  However, these seasons also come with hazardous weather, so be just as prepared for a typhoon swooshing by, as a pressing heat wave threatening to wilt your crops away.  You Can Never Have Too Many Friends Hello Kitty is all about friendship, and I can assure you that this world is full of them, and that you’ll recognize many of them. One day, Cinnamoroll™ might come knocking on your door, perhaps Pochacco™ comes sauntering, or why not go visit My Melody™?   You can also partake in activities, events, and explore the town, which is full of friendly townsfolk – many with quests for you to take on, which unlock anything from new animal friends to house upgrades.  And don’t forget that you can play together with your own friends in multiplayer! Invite them to join the cuteness bonanza, because happiness is sharing good times with friends. Express Yourself with All the Colors of the Rainbow  In the spirit of Hello Kitty, this DLC also comes bearing the gift of a cute outfit so you can look just as adorable as the rest of this world!  The Hello Kitty outfit Dress up and go full cutesy with this lovely Hello Kitty outfit, complete with a red bow and all. Now, you can really become one with the world of Hello Kitty and her friends! The Hello Kitty and Friends DLC* is out now on Minecraft Marketplace! So, start building your farm, hang out with Keroppi™, or maybe even Kuromi™, and enjoy the cute (have I mentioned it’s cute?) world of Hello Kitty today!  *Disclaimer: Requires the latest version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (sold separately), with access to Minecraft Marketplace. Limit: 1 free Hello Kitty Outfit per person/account until February 20, 2025, 10am PST; available for purchase thereafter. Multiplayer requires platform-specific online subscription (sold separately).    Community Creations Discover the best add-ons, mods, and more being built by the incredible Minecraft community!",
