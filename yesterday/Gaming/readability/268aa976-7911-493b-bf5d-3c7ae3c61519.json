I’m also going to walk you through each level and the best strategies for all of them. Here’s my complete School Time walkthrough guide, item guide, and kit tier list. Table of contentsSchool Time Beginner’s GuideAll Items Guide in School TimeAll Days Walkthrough in School TimeSchool Time Kits Tier List School Time Beginner’s Guide To beat Roblox School Time you’ll have to go through a series of levels collecting different items in each one and bringing them to the art room to progress. The teacher Mrs. Klock and the principal Mr. Jenkins (starting level 2) will chase you and instantly knock you down on contact. Other players can revive you and then you have to heal with consumable items you find. Let’s start with some basic tips and tricks: Disable Mrs. Klock and Mr. Jenkins: You can find and buy items to disable the teacher and principle like the bear trap snare that will stun them on contact or the paper ball you can throw to stun them by clicking on them with it equipped. Check out the full list of items below. Coins \u0026 Gems: You’ll find coins each level that you can spend at the end of the level to buy items for the next day. Also, there are Gems to pick up which are used in the Lobby to unlock kits which are item presets that refresh each run and they also give you permanent movement speed and health boosts. Check out the best kits below. Progression Items: In the first level you’ll need to pick up a certain number of planks and bring them to the art room to go to Day 2. This repeats for different items each day with Blueprints on Day 2 and so on. These items are randomly placed around the school and they even spawn during the level so keep looking. They’re hidden in various rooms on the floor and on the tables in classrooms but not in lockers which you need a key to open. Red Arrows: Whenever you need to reach the art room go into any hallway and find the red arrows and then follow them. They’ll lead you to the art room which is helpful until you learn the level layout yourself. Spread Out and Watch the Floor and Tables: The best strategy is to spread out into the cafeteria, gym field, and temple as well as the class rooms. Each day the level is the same so learn the layout and pay attention to the tables since the items can be on tables as well as the floor. Certain Item Effects Persist: You can dig holes with Shovels to teleport around the level or place snares and these items persist throughout all levels so feel free to place them in earlier days so you can use them later as well. I recommend digging a Shovel hole near the art room so you can quickly come back to it. Reviving Players: You can see a player who is downed through the walls so quickly rush to revive them before they run out of HP or else they’ll be eliminated and kicked from the game. You can drop healing items like Bandages and Medkits with Backspace to allow them to heal. Max 10 Items: You can only carry 10 items at a time so use Bandages and drop Traps to free up space for better items. All Items Guide in School Time Image by The Escapist You can find all of these items on the ground during each day in School Time or you can buy them at the end of a day. Below you’ll find a list of them all and a brief guide for each one on how best to use it or should you buy it. Name \u0026 CostEffectsItem GuideSodaGain a temporary speed boost.This is one of those items that you want to buy if you don’t have it between days since it’s highly useful for running away or delivering items to the art room. I would buy at least 1 if you’re out of them.LanternShines to give you better visibility during the last level (Day 5).You don’t need this on Days 1 through 4, just on the last Day 5 where the lights are turned off so I would only save 8 coins at the end of Day 4 to get this.TrapPlace it on the ground to stun the teacher or principal if they walk over it in a short radius for a short duration.I wouldn’t buy this since you can pick it up during the level and the paper ball or soda is a better item to buy to escape.BallEquip it and click on the teacher or principal to throw it and stun them after a brief delay. It’s homing so you don’t have to aim.This is both an excellent way to escape yourself or save a teammate who’s being chase. The best stun item in the game that you should always buy if you don’t have one.KeyUsed to unlock any locker for a chance at random loot from coins to other usable items. Note that lockers can also drop nothing.I wouldn’t buy this between days since you can pick them up in the level. Just save your money for a Shovel, healing items, Sodas, or the Lantern at the end of Day 4 for Day 5.SpellbookMakes you immune to all damage and slowing/immobilizing effects from tentacle lockers for a short duration.I would rather buy a soda (cheaper) and escape when you get good at spotting threats. But this is a decent beginner item.MedkitHeals 45 HP.I would always have at least one of these if you have the Coin since you can heal yourself or drop it with Backspace to heal others so it’s worth buying if you’re out or you don’t have a lot of Bandages.BandagesHeals 15 HP.No need to buy this since you will find plenty in the level and it doesn’t heal that much so just get the Medkit when you need it.ShovelDigs a hole below you. If there are at least 2 holes in the level you can press F near a hole to teleport to the other hole.Even though it’s pricey, this is the best item in School Time since the holes remain between days and you can place one near the art room to always have an easy way to come back to it. It also provides a quick way to escape being chased. Always buy this on later levels to have at least 2 or 3 between the art room and the rooms further away. All Days Walkthrough in School Time Image by the Escapist When it comes to Roblox horror games School Time is pretty simple since there are no puzzles. You just collect all items each day, bring them to the art room, and avoid getting downed by the teacher and principal. That said, there’s a special mechanic each day so let me give you some tips for all of them: Day 1 Tips: This day is really easy once you get a Trap, Soda, or Ball to escape when the teacher starts chasing you. Look for planks and bring them back to the art room, the red arrows will guide you. The most important part of Day 1 and any day for that matter is to always go to downed players to revive them. The more players pass the easier the later days will be. At the end of Day 1 and all days after you’ll get a shopping phase where you can buy the items we mentioned above. Make sure to stock up. Day 2 Tips: This where Principal Jenkins shows up so you’re basically twice as likely to get chased. Just make good use of retreating, hiding, and using the escape/stun items and you’ll be fine. Always have at least one escape/stun item on you. If you don’t, don’t risk going into open spaces without cover. Day 3 Tips: This is where both the teacher and principal can drink Soda for a speed boost. It’s more crucial than before to keep to the at least one escape/stun item strategy since they’ll catch you fast if you don’t have an escape plan. Day 4 Tips: This is where certain lockers will have tentacles coming out of them that will damage and stun you on contact. You can still pass them by just make sure to walk on the furthest opposite side of the tentacle locker in a hallway. Otherwise, strategy from days before apply. Make sure to buy the Lantern at the end of Day 4 for Day 5. Image by The Escapist Day 5 Tips: This is the last day where lights go out. Make sure you have a Lantern from one of the shopping phases before. Otherwise, strategies from Day 4 and before apply and nothing else changes. Image by The Escapist Once you beat Day 5 you’ve beaten School Time Chapter 1. Congratulations! Now we wait for Chapter 2. School Time Kits Tier List Image by The Escapist You can buy all items from all kits eventually during the game so the best kits in School Time are the ones are that give you permanent bonuses or lots of coins. The permanent bonuses are useful for all days whereas the one-time items are a short term boost. Movement speed is much better than health as a stat boost so you’ll notice kits with it are ranked higher. Health isn’t that valuable since the teacher and principle one shot you anyway. Also, kits with coins are also powerful since you can establish a Shovel hole system earlier or be flexible in what you buy depending on how the game is going. You can check what all kits do in the lobby. That’s it for my complete School Time walkthrough guide with an item guide and kit tier list.

You just collect all items each day, bring them to the art room, and avoid getting downed by the teacher and principal. That said, there’s a special mechanic each day so let me give you some tips for all of them:\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cul data-found-items=\"4\" data-current-count=\"160\" data-injectable=\"false\"\u003e \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDay 1 Tips\u003c/strong\u003e: This day is really easy once you get a Trap, Soda, or Ball to escape when the teacher starts chasing you. Look for planks and bring them back to the art room, the red arrows will guide you. The most important part of Day 1 and any day for that matter is to always go to downed players to revive them. The more players pass the easier the later days will be. At the end of Day 1 and all days after you’ll get a shopping phase where you can buy the items we mentioned above. Make sure to stock up.\u003c/li\u003e    \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDay 2 Tips\u003c/strong\u003e: This where Principal Jenkins shows up so you’re basically twice as likely to get chased. Just make good use of retreating, hiding, and using the escape/stun items and you’ll be fine. Always have at least one escape/stun item on you. If you don’t, don’t risk going into open spaces without cover.\u003c/li\u003e    \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDay 3 Tips\u003c/strong\u003e: This is where both the teacher and principal can drink Soda for a speed boost. It’s more crucial than before to keep to the at least one escape/stun item strategy since they’ll catch you fast if you don’t have an escape plan.\u003c/li\u003e    \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDay 4 Tips\u003c/strong\u003e: This is where certain lockers will have tentacles coming out of them that will damage and stun you on contact. You can still pass them by just make sure to walk on the furthest opposite side of the tentacle locker in a hallway. Otherwise, strategy from days before apply. \u003cstrong\u003eMake sure to buy the Lantern at the end of Day 4 for Day 5\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e    \u003cfigure data-current-count=\"460\" data-injectable=\"true\"\u003e\u003cimg data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1045\" height=\"697\" src=\"https://www.escapistmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/school-time-day-4-tentacle-locker.jpg?resize=1045%2C697\" alt=\"school time day 4 tentacle locker\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eImage by The Escapist\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e    \u003cul data-found-items=\"1\" data-current-count=\"40\" data-injectable=\"false\"\u003e \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDay 5 Tips\u003c/strong\u003e: This is the last day where lights go out.
