This setting will allow players to change the appearance of spider-like enemies in Zombies without affecting their game play.\"Black Ops 6's arachnophobia mode somehow seems even worse. Image credit: Activision.The description is accompanied by a screenshot that shows a spider beast crawling toward the player on one side, and what it looks like when the arachnophobia mode is turned on. It seems the toggle simply removes the spider creatures legs, turning it into a floating torso that resembles a flying leech with huge, spiky teeth. In a word, eww. But hey, at least it's not a spider, right?The new feature is part of Black Ops 6's version of Zombies, the latest in a long line of games dating back to Call of Duty: World at War. You can check out our full Zombies preview right here. Black Ops 6, meanwhile, releases October 25, but fans who use the New Zealand trick can gain access right now much earlier.
