  "text": "Marketplace Written By Linn Viberg Published 10/15/24 Oh, the blocky places you’ll go! Discover the wobbly world of Dr. Seuss, brought to life by Shaliquinn’s Schematics! In this new Dr Seuss DLC you can solve the escape-room mystery of The Lorax, parkour your way through The Cat in the Hat, and journey through the wild maze that is Oh, the Places You’ll Go! – no pickaxe (or common sense) needed! Let’s just say that these adventures have plenty of rhyme, but perhaps a little less reason. Match the madness with the free Dr. Seuss-themed Character Creator item: the Cat in the Hat bow tie, then let’s jump straight to where our blocky story begins… THE LORAX Like many times in Minecraft, your adventure begins in a forest biome. This one, however, looks quite a bit different from what you might be used to. Among a sea of colorful Truffula trees hide not only fanciful mobs, like the bear-like bar-ba-loots and the long-necked swomee-swans, but the escape room adventure of the Lorax. Make your way across the enchanted forest to the Once-ler’s house and the Biggered Factory as you work to solve its mystery. With each clue you gather and quest you complete, your surroundings transform before your eyes. Just beware, whilst there might not be any creepers in these woods, there’s definitely something unexpected! THE CAT IN THE HAT A tricky balancing act is up next as we find ourselves in the mischievous tale of The Cat in the Hat. In this nostalgic adventure, you’ll follow the Cat through a narrated puzzle where things are about to get real messy. As you make your way thought the house, you will find surprising situations, sticky dilemmas, and perhaps the reckless Thing One or Thing Two! The rules are clear, but will you stick to them? That is completely down to you. The beauty of Minecraft is no parent, fish, or zombie can tell you what to do. Stay out all night? Be my guest! Dig straight down? I don't see why not. OH, THE PLACES YOU’LL GO! Think that’s all? No! There’s still the epic journey through Oh, the Places You’ll Go!. Spawn into an expansive maze where you’ll need to work to escape. Travel through wild scenes from the book, solve the riddles you run into, and defeat whatever is obstructing your path. Just don’t forget to explore what’s around! From the swirly whirly tents and the sad sea monsters to the field of hot air balloons and the edge of darkness, this expedition will show you the most wonderful, blocky sights. Who knows? There might even be a good chance you’ll meet things that scare you right out of your diamond armor pants! The Dr. Seuss DLC is available now so there’s no time to lose! Leave the Waiting Place behind and make your way to Minecraft Marketplace to dive into the perfectly zany and now-blocky world of Dr. Seuss!
