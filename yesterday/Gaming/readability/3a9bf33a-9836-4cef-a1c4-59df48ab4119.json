The wait is nearly over! Tomorrow, on January 28, our new game, Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter, will be released into the wild, returning players to its gritty, medieval, and anthropomorphic world of epic battles and visceral executions. Set several rat years after the conclusion of the original, the story follows the paws of Arlo, heir to the Warden of the Wastes, as he journeys across the far stretches of the Ratdom’s northern frontier in a valiant effort to overcome a devastating and ancient evil that’s spreading across the land. When Tails of Iron first launched in 2021, we were blown away by the overwhelming support from players and critics alike; it was truly humbling. So, when it came to developing the second instalment in the Tails of Iron saga, we wanted to expand the experience in several ways – and that’s what we’ve done!  We’ve added further gameplay and combat mechanics, revised systems, and introduced fearsome new challenges, while keeping the same brutal charm you loved in the first game. There’s much to gnaw on in this sequel, but today we’re going to briefly look at the new beast hunt gameplay, how Arlo is preparing to fight back against the giant creatures and the Dark Wings. Elementa: Magic from the Gods As the ice-cold shadow of the Dark Wings, an old and near-mythical enemy of the Rats, drapes across the northern frontier, leaving a wanton trail of destruction, the Rat gods of old grow ever fearful. And so, in a desperate attempt to turn the tide, they gift their elemental powers to Arlo. One of the new additions we’re bringing to combat in Tails of Iron 2 is the Elementa spellcasting system, which brings a further layer of strategy to combat. Unlocked during Arlo’s quest across the Wastes and beyond, he’ll be able to harness four devastating forces to help vanquish his foes: Electric: Summon lightning from the heavens to stun multiple foes in their tracks. Fire: Launch fireballs at enemies in a straight path, leaving trails of devastation. Ice: Unleash freezing gusts that immobilize foes with a chilling grip. Poison: Inflict a slow but deadly damage-over-time effect on groups of enemies. Elementa abilities can also become more powerful when their upgrade shines are discovered, giving Arlo more devastating powers to wield against enemies.  Elemental Strategies and Tactical Combat Spellcasting isn’t the only combat system embracing the power of the elements. Enemies in Tails of Iron 2 have specific weaknesses to certain types of elemental damage, making tactical preparation crucial. Knowing when to equip a fire-infused weapon or wear poison-resistant armor can mean the difference between glorious victory and deadly defeat. The same goes for in-game crafting: Weapons and armor will need to be forged and tailored to an enemy’s weaknesses to support Arlo in battle. We’ve also introduced elemental traps into the game, essential for trying to control the impending onslaught from a group of enemies. With the expanded arsenal of weapons and armor types, from venomous swords to frost-resistant plate mail, it’s crucial to think strategically to dominate the battlefield. The Northern Wastes demand cunning as much as strength! The Thrill of the Hunt Across the Northern Wastes are colossal monsters that antagonise and threaten the peoples of the frontier, and naturally, as you’d expect from any hero, Arlo’s journey wouldn’t be truly complete without taking on these terrifying beasts. As he explores the world beyond Winter’s Edge, from The Golden Forest to the White Whiskers and further afar, Arlo can accept contracts from locals and embark on epic monster hunts to rid the land of its most deadly threats. And these hunts are no pushover. Each is a battle for survival, with cunning enemies that will test Arlo’s skills and resolve. But the rewards are worth every risk. Defeating these beasts yields rare resources to craft some of the game’s rarest and most powerful equipment, strengthening more than Arlo’s resolve against the tyrannical Dark Wings. And of course, every victory comes with the glory of solidifying a legacy as the ultimate monster hunter! Ready to Defend the Ratdom? We’re really excited for the release of Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One tomorrow, January 28, and we hope you enjoy experiencing the expanded combat and gameplay we’ve touched upon. There’s more across the Ratdom to discover, so whether you’re wielding elemental magic, rebuilding Winter’s Edge, or hunting ferocious beasts, this is a ‘tail’ for the ages.
