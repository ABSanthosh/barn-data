  "text": "Rising from ashes of Epic Games' Paragon. Image credit: Omeda Studios Free-to-play MOBA Predecessor is doing a Fortnite as it returns to its original map, in tribute to its Epic Games-developed predecessor (pun intended). Epic Games previously released a MOBA called Paragon, but in 2018 it shut down the servers. However, content creator Robbie Singh refused to let it die and so, using public assets from Paragon, formed Omeda Studios to develop spiritual successor Predecessor. A year after its launch in August 2024, Predecessor will now return to Paragon's map, called Agora, following demand from its community. It's a move similar to Fortnite's OG map and Call of Duty Warzone's return to Verdansk. Forge Your Legacy | Launch Trailer | Predecessor Predecessor launch trailer.Watch on YouTube \"The Agora map holds a special place in the hearts of OG Paragon players because it was their first introduction to that world, a world that felt vast, immersive, and alive in a way other MOBAs, constrained by isometric perspectives, simply couldn't replicate,\" Singh told Eurogamer. \"The sense of verticality, scale, and atmosphere gave players an unprecedented level of immersion, making them feel not like detached commanders but as true heroes fighting for control of a living, breathing world.\" Predecessor plays similarly to League of Legends as a lane-based strategic MOBA with over 40 heroes to play as, but with a third-person perspective and map verticality. The Agora map will be playable for a limited time in Predecessor's new Legacy Mode, which arrives in the game's patch 1.7. This will also include a new hero, Renna (pictured above) - a powerful dark magic wielder. Patch 1.7 will be available from 22nd July, and will also include new skins and gameplay fixes. \"There has never been a better time to play Predecessor,\" said Singh. \"The game has evolved thanks to our incredible community, who constantly engage and share their feedback. We believe we've found a great blend of fast-paced action and deep strategy, doubling down on the things players care about most, like increased verticality and fluid combat, while introducing an augment system that gives players unprecedented freedom to shape their playstyle.\" Singh also pointed to the regular addition of new heroes and the thriving competitive scene as key reasons for players to stick with the game. Predecessor launched in August 2024 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam, Epic). It's hoped the game will not only outlast Paragon, but will continue to compete against other popular live-service games.",
