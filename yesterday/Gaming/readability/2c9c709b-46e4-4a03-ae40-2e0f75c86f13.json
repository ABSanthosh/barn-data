  "text": "The group… at least three of us in the group… continues to enjoy the ride through Enshrouded.  A lot of the time it feels pretty free form, like you can go where you want, while having a plenty of little tasks to take care of when we’re together.  I think our list of active quests hovers between 16 and 22 most of the time. Welcome to Enshrouded But for all the free form feel it can have at times, there is a wider plan of content gating and progress that is… bless them… not just based on levels.  Gear, skills, crafting, and other upgrades play into how far you can range in the world.  And, as it happens, we were bumping up against one such gate, our flame level. In a clever bit of design, players have to set down a flame altar in order to build a persistent base.  The altar marks off a square of the world that remains how you changed it when you log off or go away.  The rest of the world returns to its original state, but your base persists.  I say “clever” because it does mean that the game only has to keep track of changes to a limited area unlike, say, Minecraft or Valheim, where any change you make has to been recorded down to the block. Part of the flame altar is the level of your flame.  This influences how far you can upgrade your flame shrine (which dictates the size of your base), how many flame shrines you can have, how long you can stay in the shroud, and what areas of the shroud you can travel through safely. (Details here) We were starting to get quests that put us on the far side of a location called The Pillars of Creation.  However, the path beyond said pillars was blocked by sections of the shroud that were red, and red shroud will kill you fast if you stray into it. Red Shroud is Dead Shroud We needed to upgrade our flame to unlock that, but unlocking a new flame level requires a set of ingredients… an array of things that you can only access if you’ve found certain resources and upgraded your crafting… again, clever and interlocked content gating… and something from a boss. For our next upgrade, to flame level 4, we had found most everything, from copper ore to amber to the ability to craft goo.  We were just missing the ingredient from the appropriate boss, the head of a wispwyvern. That meant an expedition to go find the boss, which was said to be located in a place called Pikemead’s Reach.  This involved Potshot fast traveling to the nearest travel spire, getting as much distance out of a glide towards the place, and then bumbling our way across the landscape until we managed to get funneled in the right direction.  As it was, we ended up coming in via a side door and got into some trouble.  We ran around, kept alive, then started looking for a place we could drop a flame altar to give us a fast travel point.  We ended up going around the perimeter and ended up outside the front gate, where we plopped down a flame altar and build a work bench for repair, because after travel the ability to repair your stuff is a pretty big deal. That setup we were able to get Ula over to us so we could start scouting the city… only, then night fell and we went back to base to sleep to get past that.  Once day returned, we headed into the city. Entering Pikemead’s Reach Pikemead’s Reach and its surroundings show the damage of the siege and struggle that the former inhabitants went through when the world came crashing down and the shroud took over.  There are trenches and siege weapons and a decent supply of arrows that can be picked up to refill your supply. Right at the front door there was a respawn shrine.  This is always a sign that you’re going into some place dangerous. The respawn shrine is a warning, heed it There are actually several in the city, including one close to the wispwyvern.  It pays to scout the area to find these things, lest you end up with a kilometer long run back to your corpse… but we’ll get to that story another time. The city is sprawling and the location for a number of quests, including another follower we picked up for our base along the way, Ramon. (Ramon mostly provides quests, including a quest he gave us once we arrived back at base and got him a bed… they all need a bed… which sent us right back to the city.  The game is like that sometimes.  But the city is a decent backdrop for such quests.) Over the city First of all, in that image above, moments later I jumped off the top of the tower we were on and managed to glide through the hole in the roof to explore what was in the attic of the building that I am partially obscuring.  The game encourages that and I enjoy it. Also, we ended up having quite the time getting to the location of the wispwyvern.  The city is also a bit of a maze, puzzle, or whatever.  A sliver of the keep where you find the wispwyvern is visible at the top of the image above, directly up from me.  We struggled to get there.  Along the way we ended up falling out of the right side of the town, from my point of view above, and ended up climbing up the hill beyond the wall at the upper right and just gliding down in front of the keep. Again, the game allows some alternate solutions to pathing issues. There, we worked out way up to the keep, and set ourselves up for the fight.  Potshot had looked it up and the key seemed to be to stay away from the wispwyvern as much as possible until it reared up and opened its mouth, then to shoot it with an arrow in the mouth, which would stun it, and then to run up to it and pound it for all we were worth while we had the respite. We have sorted ourselves out into roles, with Ula as the melee DPS, Potshot as the caster/healer, and me as the tank.  So in I went to stir things up. Well, go get him… There are some pillars and obstacles around the courtyard where you fight the wispwyvern, which make you think maybe you can hide behind them… but the wyvern has other ideas and pretty much crushes everything in its path, then rears up and hits everybody with a bit AOE shot. Still, we stayed in motion and I tried not to kite the wyvern over the caster… and mostly succeeded… fortunately the aggro skill I trained seemed to work pretty well… and when the time came, it was an arrow in the mouth and then time to stick it to him.  A few rounds of that and we did him in. Victory over with Wispwyvern Looting him got us the head… two heads, actually, as I have harvesting set to double output, which includes drops like this I guess… a couple of items, and a key to the rest of the keep. That led us on a side venture into the tower behind the wyvern, which included a number of grappling hook and climbing challenges, most of which were manageable, save for the one around the back. The swinging grapple challenge You can see the platform I am on and the one across the gap from me and, possibly, if you squint, the grapple point suspended between the two.  I did the swing across fine and on the first try while Ula and Potshot both fell and had quite a time getting the swing right.  I was absolutely no help either because I just DID the swing without thinking about it so could not offer any useful advice as to how to do the swing. Eventually we all got across, but a night cycle went by in the interim. Once past we made it up to the top, found more chests, including one with some royal attire cosmetic gear.  From the pinnacle we surveyed the city from the other end. Looking back to where we came in You can see, if you click to enlarge the image, the tower I was standing on in the first city view off to the left and the building into which I flew.  I looked around some more up there… the views are quite grand in Enshrouded… and took a last look at the wispwyvern. The wispwyvern laid out in the courtyard Then it was back to base to do the big upgrade. Flame strength 4… activate! We were now able to get through the pillars and deeper into the world. The extra head also allowed us to mount a trophy of the wispwyvern in our base. Trophy zone WoW would do well to enable anything even resembling the housing options available in Enshrouded when the time comes.  That is no doubt too big of an ask, but one can dream. We also now had a forward operating base near Pikemead’s Reach, which we had returned to a couple of times. Our base just outside of town on the map You can see a couple of shroud root symbols on the map, the purple diamonds, which are handy in that they not only give you a talent point the first time you destroy them, but they are also points within the shroud that, when do you destroy them, become shroud free so you can take a breather and reset your shroud timer. We went back for a couple of quests, including Ramon’s thing about a statue, which we collected then were able to setup on our base. Photo bombed by the bird The bird was tamed beyond the pillars in the new area that we can access, which has been dubbed “The Barrens” due to its look. I mean, it fits, right? So that has unlocked a whole new area to explore… though, honestly, we haven’t really finished exploring the bits we had available to use before.  Always more to do, which is part of the appeal.",

it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, we ended up having quite the time getting to the location of the wispwyvern.  The city is also a bit of a maze, puzzle, or whatever.  A sliver of the keep where you find the wispwyvern is visible at the top of the image above, directly up from me.  We struggled to get there.  Along the way we ended up falling out of the right side of the town, from my point of view above, and ended up climbing up the hill beyond the wall at the upper right and just gliding down in front of the keep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, the game allows some alternate solutions to pathing issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, we worked out way up to the keep, and set ourselves up for the fight.  Potshot had looked it up and the key seemed to be to stay away from the wispwyvern as much as possible until it reared up and opened its mouth, then to shoot it with an arrow in the mouth, which would stun it, and then to run up to it and pound it for all we were worth while we had the respite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have sorted ourselves out into roles, with Ula as the melee DPS, Potshot as the caster/healer, and me as the tank.  So in I went to stir
