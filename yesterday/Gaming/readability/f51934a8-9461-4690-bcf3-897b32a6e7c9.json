  "text": "The thing about the books is that, after the siege of Minas Tirith and the follow up planning, events on that front move pretty quickly towards the host of the west standing outside the gates of Mordor and then Sauron unleashing all he’s got on them. And even that isn’t told in much detail, because the important bit is Frodo and Sam, so the narrative cuts to them and we’re only back out with the host of the west when the battle is over. But SSG can’t bend the narrative to the point of having you chase and catch up with Frodo and Same, and they certainly don’t want to stop delivering content that people might pay for, so they have to give you something to do while the ring is dealt with. That means building out the events from the plan to march to the Black Gate and the battle that occurs before it.  How could SSG possibly flesh that out?  Never fear, there are more than enough things along the way that they can have you clean up,  starting in Osgiliath, the settlement on the river crossing on the far side of the Pelennor from Minas Tirith. Osgiliath awaits There you find an allied camp with a stablemaster and somebody with a list of chores.  Go find things, go kill things, go make yourself useful while we figure out what to do with you. Osgiliath is pretty beat up.  I didn’t see it pre-siege… if that is even possible… but the forces of Sauron were not kind to the place.  Either that, or the dev team had more wrecked building art assets available.  It does seem like Sauron’s forces are a bit short sighted in wrecking every place they visit.  Don’t they need some place to live?  They aren’t all orcs.  Some of them must want nice things. Anyway, I did some work there, but was ahead enough on levels that I felt like skipping ahead into Ithilien.  So I paid the stable master a mithril coin to send me to the stable master Henneth Annun, which again upset the order of things.  I did some quests for the rangers there, then ended up back on the Pelennor for another quest, at which point I got a quest that sent me to off to Ithilien and then to Henneth Annun, but I went by a side path chasing another quest such that on my way out of the place I went down the road and ran into a ranger who stopped me with the burning golden ring over his head, which set off my insatiable desire to click on him. He blindfolded me so he could take me to Henneth Annun.  I let him have his fun.  I didn’t want to spoil it by mentioning I had been there a couple times already and had already done some lifting and carrying for Mablung and crew.  I had already seen the sights. Looking out from Henneth Annun I had been keen to get to Henneth Annun because I had focused some of my daily tasks on gaining rep with the Rangers of Ithilien, thinking their vendor might at least have a travel skill for me.  But no.  Post-siege Henneth Annun is part of the Host of the West faction.  But I had made it some ways with them… reward for all my cleaning up and fire dousing… so I did end up with the fast travel skill to the place. Henneth Annun is primarily in the books as the place where Frodo and Sam meet Farimir and see the men of the south and their oliphant. In the game the place is used as a point of exposition where various individuals tell you… through travel to a sepia toned series of instances… to catch you up on all that happened while you were off in Dunland or Rohan for all that while.  The upshot is that you too get to experience the oliphant with Sam. Wasn’t this called an Elefink in Dunland? The sepia tone makes everything hard to see, so if you follow the quest chain in the area then you will get to see one in the wild… and feed it and help it out.   Seriously. This brings up a whole side question, which I may tackle at a later date, as to how good of a telling of the works Dr. Tolkien the game is.  That is, after all, at the core of the game, the story of Frodo and Sam and Aragorn and all the other major and minor players.  One certainly gets a different, and often more detailed, view into the life and times of Middle-earth via this quarter scale replica.  And you are, in your way, tied up in the tale.  But is it art… or whatever? I mean, I knew the significance of this particular spot in the woods. The king with the lidless eye for a head But is it covered in a cut scene or deep in some quest text that it was something that Frodo and Sam had witnessed? A task for another time. Anyway, I was getting tired of cleaning up messes, so found Aragorn, the keep of the epic quest chain at this point, and fed him his requests until we moved on to the forward camp of the Host of the West where all the usual suspects were hanging about talking… and thinking up things for me to do I guess, because there I was on the edge of the wastes, the Dead Marshes in the distance, and the Morrannon and the Black Gate within an easy ride, but suddenly people are interested in the flora and fauna and what happened to that guy’s dog we had along and somebody left something out in some ruins. Seriously, not a lot of focus on the issue at hand. At the forward camp Still, running around the place… even a small scale version of it… was interesting.  You don’t get a lot of description that I recall from the books, so the ruins of places that were built in support of the watch on Mordor painted a picture of a different place from nearly an age back. Out in The Wastes… some more ruins… Being on the VIP list, I was in on all the discussions and Gandalf had a whole vision event about Cirith Ungol he wanted me to play through… probably as an orc again… but fortunately there was a shortened account available for this one. Seriously I draw the line at playing other characters in my own story.  I am not that lonely yet. Then there was a whole scouting mission into one of the towers near the black gate where, for whatever reason, somebody decided to have a strategy discussion in a dark area where we could hide and listen and have one of the rangers translate, in real time, the discussion. They’re going to let us get to the gates… yeah, kind of knew that At that point the gates themselves were pretty active, with troops marching too and fro like the castle of the Wicked Witch of the West. Before the Black Gate… Mordor Ahead But it seemed they were all going to march inside, shut the gate, and be very quiet until it was time to spring the surprise. The quest gave me a camera fly through of the area… which is how I got that shot of the gate above… which included the two slag hills on which the battle before the gates were destined to occur. The slag hills, no more than a B cup at best I don’t remember the hills being surrounded by pools of acid… that stuff is a 500hp hit when you step into it… but artistic license is a thing. There is also a stable master back behind the hills and Aragorn ends up there ahead of the army marching there, but for some reason wants me to scout ahead.  Well, I wanted to move things forward and the epic quest line is likely to kick things off.  But I didn’t see much. Seems peaceful enough When I got back and reported on that, Aragorn seem satisfied.  I just wanted to know how much longer until the big event.  My quest to reach Mordor was so close to completion.  I was level 109 and ready to go.",
