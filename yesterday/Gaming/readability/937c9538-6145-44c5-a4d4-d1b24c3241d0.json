It is what it is! Perhaps the dismantling of our current economic system and rebuilding one that doesn't put profits first would mean developers could take their time, but that'll probably also take a while. As a result, we're in a situation where, earlier today, developer TaleWorlds Entertainment announced that Mount \u0026 Blade 2: Bannerlord's first bit of DLC, War Sails, has been delayed. \"After taking a hard look at where things stand, it became clear we won’t be ready by the originally planned release date of June 17th,\" TaleWorlds explained in a post on their website. Now, the strategy game is currently slated for a slightly less specific fall/ autumn release window later this year Further explaining the delay TaleWorlds wrote that they came to this decision because they \"need more time to reach the level of quality you rightfully expect. The extra development period will give us more time to apply additional polish, and continue making progress on the improvements to the base game that are already in motion.\" A new release date should be on the way in \"upcoming weeks\" at least. War Sails, if you could tell by the name, is all about going out on a lovely little sailing trip. Well, maybe not lovely, it's more about doing trade or fighting enemies, but you get what I mean. You'll be able to board enemy ships while out on the open sea, and a Viking-inspired faction is being introduced with this expansion too. All of it sounds pretty good, you just won't be playing it next month.",
