  "text": "Heard split through the grapevine. Image credit: Hazelight Split Fiction's full original soundtrack is now available to stream. Featuring original works by Swedish musicians Gustaf Grefberg and Jonatan Järpehag, the soundtrack - which Grefberg called \"as fun as it gets\" - is available on all the usual platforms, including Spotify, YouTube, Apple, and Amazon. Split Fiction PS5 Gameplay - Zoe \u0026 Ian Play The First 90 Minutes! Split Fiction PS5 Gameplay - Zoe \u0026 Ian Play The First 90 Minutes!Watch on YouTube The playlist features 45 tracks, the synth score \"providing the perfect backdrop to Mio and Zoe’s sci-fi and fantasy adventures with unique tracks ranging from atmospheric to high tension\". \"Since every chapter in Split Fiction is so different, we wanted to do things similarly to the visuals and the gameplay and throw the player into a new world of music,\" Grefberg explained in a Q\u0026A about the game's music. \"Sometimes the inspiration comes from common genres like trance or drum and bass or cinematic new age music. Other times the inspiration originated from a single instrument. For example, the traversal music throughout most of Summit is based on our own live recordings of hangdrums. There are a few subtle references in there, but most inspiration is based on the foundations of genres or instruments taken in our own unique direction.\" Grefberg explained that to create the dynamic score that jumps between different genres, the composers \"sat down and played through with what we had, which often meant something very much work-in-progress\". \"We discussed the overall feeling before we spent some time (usually one to two weeks, depending on available time) to just try out ideas and moods. We then sat down with Josef and listened together and came to a final direction. Sometimes we got them down right away, other times we went through a few iterations to get the feeling and mood that we all aligned with and Josef enjoyed.\" Split Fiction shifted 1m units in 48 hours, and then another million copies in its first week - and now it's officially record-breaking, too. Last month, Guinness World Records revealed Hazelight's part-fantasy, part-sci-fi adventure \"broke an impressive three world records within days of its release\", becoming the most played local co-op video game on Steam, the most sold local co-op video game within 48 hours of release, and most sold local co-op video game within one week of release.",
