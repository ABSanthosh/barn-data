  "text": "\"You asked. Zlatan is back.\" Image credit: EA If you're eager to know what's new in EA Sports FC 26, your day is almost here; EA is giving its latest football iteration the full reveal treatment later this week. And it's also unveiled this year's Ultimate Edition cover star, so you got something to look at while you wait. More specifically, EA Sports FC 26's \"full reveal\" is scheduled to air this Wednesday, 16th July. Proceedings get underway at 5pm BST, so you've got approximately 47 hours at the time of writing to dig out your best hat in anticipation. And when you're done, you'll be wanting to bookmark the appropriate YouTube page. EA's reveal announcement arrives alongside a second announcement confirming one of this year's EA Sports FC cover stars: retired Swedish footballer Zlatan Ibrahimović is EA Sports FC 26's Ultimate Edition cover star, despite falling out with the company back in 2020 when he accused it of using his name and face without any agreement in the FIFA games. There's no official release date for EA Sports FC 26 yet (previous leaks have suggested EA is eyeing up a 26th September launch, however), but expect it to be available on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, Switch, Switch 2, and PC when it eventually shows up.",
