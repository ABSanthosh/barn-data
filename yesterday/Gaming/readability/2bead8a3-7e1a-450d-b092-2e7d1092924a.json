  "text": "Last week I wrote a bit about The Heroes Journey EQemu server, why they are in trouble, and why I think their loss in court is inevitable.  Along the way I took a jab at people who were appealing to the idea of video game preservation in support of THJ because, whatever it is that THJ does, it does not in any way attempt to preserve a version of the game ever offered to players by SOE, Daybreak, or Enad Global 7. That said, perhaps there ought to be a version of the official EverQuest story that is less like 1999 or 2006 or 2024.  There is a lot of space in Norrath for variety. That is a lot of walking Part of the problem is that the EverQuest crew has been particularly devoted to a specific vision of the game for… well, since forever… even problematic aspects.  When Daybreak really began to jump on the special server bandwagon about a decade back, then executive producer Holly Longdale was often quite adamant that they wouldn’t doing anything that would break from the true classic experience.  Things like instancing raids was completely off the table… which meant watching history repeat itself as the same problems that happened back in 1999 or 2002 or whenever occurred again with raid guilds in conflict and sabotaging each other until a GM had to be assigned to maintain a raid schedule and reservation system. In my recap of the 2011 Fippy Darkpaw progression server you can find various points of reliving the same problems occurring in the same way for the same reasons with such regularity that the team eventually conceded that maybe not every aspect of the “good old days” were all that good.  Instanced raid zones became a thing.  Multiple versions of zones became a thing to handle over crowding without having to spin up an additional server that would inevitably need to be merged back into the first server when the “happens every time” population drop hit once the tourists had had enough of the “good old days” and went back to WoW or whatever. Hell, the fact that there is a server queue is due to these special rules servers. But the special rules… haven’t been all that special.  While there has been some experimentation with speed and content unlocks and loot tables, the end result is we get a new EverQuest server every year in late spring that isn’t all that much different from the previous half dozen. There just isn’t enough of an appetite for minor variations on the same theme landing every year.  Nostalgia is driven by lack of availability.  When there is always another bus set to show up, the whole experience looses its edge. While I do not buy into the THJ fan boy conspiracy theory that the lawsuit is driven by this year’s special server, Fangbreaker, not attracting enough of a population, I will grant that my response to this year’s variation on the theme was tepid at best. Oh boy, we’re going to launch with the first three expansions available.  That’ll be fun.  And then we’ll carry on as before until some point in the early 2030s when it will catch up with live.  huzzah. While I was down on the EverQuest II Dozekar PvP special server last month…  if only because they keep trying that same thing over and over… at least that is a bit of a variation from “classic, but everybody has blue eyes and a slightly deeper tone of voice” scheme that plagues the original. I compare this with the World of Warcraft classic server plan… which was, initially, just classic and we’ll see what happens.  But then we got Hardcore and the season servers… though the fact that those just end and good-bye is a bit too much for a progression junkie who grows attached to their character to handle… but Blizz is at least expanding a bit. I still wrote a post with five server ideas that they could try, and didn’t exactly need some peyote and a spirit guide to help me out.  For a recap, they were: All raids have a five person group option All raids and dungeons have a solo option All content requires a group Cataclysm vanilla fresh start Open world, full loot PvP option I think you could apply at least three of those to EverQuest as special server ideas.  Making raids a normal group content thing… I mean, they went and put them in instances, so the hard work has been done already… would expand the ability of players to see content to which they might otherwise not have access. Likewise, the “everything solo,” which I  think of as the “tourist” option… I bet it would get some traction.  That would be a little more difficult to manage… but if you turn the dials to make players powerful enough, you could get there.  Now, could you make players behave?  That is another story. I think EQ already has the “all content requires a group” option pretty well covered.  Maybe you dial up mob difficulty a little bit. I am not sure what the Norrath equivalent of a Cataclysm fresh start would be.  Opening up the server at The Serpent’s Spine?  That would get you a dozen expansions in at least. And… as I noted in the original WoW focused post, I would only endorse open world, full loot PvP as a social experiment to prove that open world, full loot PvP is a really bad idea 95% of the time.  You have to create an ecosystem where lost gear can be easily replaced and some sort of town justice system to give people a place of respite from being ganked. Those are five fairly obvious things that I don’t think the EQ team has done with their special server run.  And, if the THJ fanboys are right, maybe there is an appetite for something like the first or second option.  I mean, people are paying them money to play… which is where their trouble began.",
