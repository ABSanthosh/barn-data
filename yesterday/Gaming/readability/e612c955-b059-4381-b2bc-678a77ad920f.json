Starting this week, Amazon has discounted the 2024 65\" Panasonic Z85 4K OLED Smart TV with Amazon Fire TV for just $999.99 with free delivery. This is an excellent TV to pair up with your PlayStation 5 since it has HDMI 2.1 inputs and a 120Hz refresh rate.65\" Panasonic Z85 4K OLED Fire TV for $999.9965\" Panasonic Z85 4K OLED Fire TVThe Panasonic Z85 TV uses a W-OLED panel so image quality is comparable to the Samsung S85C/D/F, Sony Bravia 8/A80, and LG B4/B3 models. Since this is a true OLED panel, the Z85 boasts near instantaneous response time, near infinite contrast ratio, and true blacks. It's superior to any other panel type in nearly every scenario except for one: super bright rooms with no light control (OLEDs aren't as bright as Mini LED or LED LCD TVs).The Z85 is an excellent future-proof gaming TV because it has a native 120Hz refresh rate and HDMI 2.1 ports. That means it is capable of running games in 4K at up to 120fps on both the PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles. It's a great TV for the upcoming Switch 2 as well, since the console is locked at 60fps when running games in 4K. The Z85 also has other convenient gaming features like variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode.This is the best price I can find for a brand new 65\" OLED TV with a full warranty. Panasonic is a well-known brand with a solid TV history. Although they had been out of the game for a while, they've recently returned, targeting the higher-end market with Mini-LED and OLED offerings.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
