I mean, it's all underground, where's the dirt meant to go? And it's not like anyone's putting any money into getting the place cleaned. But, if you've ever fantasized about hosing down a Northern Line train for yourself, one, that's possibly slightly odd, and two, you'll be able to do almost just that in PowerWash Simulator's next and last update. Developer FuturLab shared an update earlier today saying that \"the time has come to reach our final destination for PowerWash Simulator.\" Four years on since the game launch into early access in 2021, the cleaning sim will be getting an update titled The Muckingham Files 6 where you'll be able to clean up a legally safe version of a London underground train, as well as a nice looking park with a big gnome statue, amongst others. PowerWash Simulator | The Muckingham Files 6 Release Trailer Watch on YouTube The update is already available too, and it's completely free, so you'll just need to update your game when you're feeling the need to clean. If you're wondering, \"wait, last update? Why?\", I would like to say that it's okay when things end sometimes, but also, PowerWash Simulator 2 was announced a couple of months ago, so that'll be why the first one is winding down. The sequel is set to arrive sometime in 2025, as long as all goes to plan, and it'll even have splitscreen co-op. FuturLab are also self-publishing this one, so unfortunately you probably won't be able to give Cloud's sword a good polish this time around.",
