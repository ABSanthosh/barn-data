  "text": "Curb, Chucky, Arcane, and What We Do in the Shadows came to an end while The Boys and The Witcher announced their final bows.This list contains shows whose networks made their cancellation announcements in 2024, even if a show won't air its final season until 2025 or beyond.We're keeping a running list of all of the TV shows that have been cancelled, or ended, or announced to be ending here in 2024.Curb Your Enthusiasm, Chucky, The Acolyte, Arcane, Young Sheldon, Halo, The Umbrella Academy, and What We Do In the Shadows are just some of the notable series leaving us this year, as well as final seasons being announced for The Boys, The Witcher, and Squid Game.A few long-running network shows also closed up shop in 2024, including S.W.A.T., SEAL Team, The Good Doctor, Station 19, and a couple CSI/NCIS entries. On the spinoff front, we lost Grown-ish, Dead Boy Detectives, and Orphan Black: Echoes. Paramount's new Golden Era of Star Trek is still chugging along -- with Section 31, Starfleet Academy, and more Strange New Worlds on the way -- but we saw the conclusions of both Star Trek: Discovery and Star Treks: Lower Decks. And speaking of eras, a big one ended with The CW axing Walker, All American: Homecoming, and Superman \u0026 Lois, leaving All American as the network's only scripted series.For a look at all of the
