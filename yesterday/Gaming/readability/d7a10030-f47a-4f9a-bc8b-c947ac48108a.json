  "text": "Despite year of radio silence. Image credit: BioWare It's been almost a year since Saber Interactive last shared an update on its long-in-the-works and reportedly troubled Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake. But despite the ensuing radio silence, it's now insisting, \"Everything that we have talked about is still in development.\" A Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake was first announced for PlayStation 5 and PC back in 2021, with developer Aspyr at the helm. Since then, however, the project has been dogged by rumours of difficulties behind-the-scenes, with a report in 2022 claiming it was \"in serious trouble\" and \"delayed indefinitely\". Shortly after that report, it was confirmed Warhammer 40K: Space Marine developer Saber Interactive had taken over development duties, but still nothing has been seen of the project since its initial unveiling. More reports of its apparent demise surfaced in 2023 - although those were quickly rebuffed - and the project's future was called into question again last year when Saber Interactive split with parent company Embracer Group. Knights of the Old Republic Remake - Cinematic Reveal Teaser Trailer | PlayStation Showcase 2021 Here's how the KOTOR remake was announced back in 2021.Watch on YouTube Saber's most recent comments on KOTOR came last April, when company boss Matthew Karch insisted the remake was \"alive and well\" - but with almost a year of radio silence now past since then, doubts have begun spreading through the fan community again. All of which brings us to the present, and Saber's latest tacit assurances the KOTOR remake remains in development. Following this week's news that Saber is now starting up development on Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 3, studio chief creative officer Tim Willits took to social media to reassure fans that it's other announced games remain unaffected. \"Saber Interactive is one of the largest independent developers in the world,\" Willits wrote. \"We are working on numerous games across many different genres. Everything that we have talked about is still in development. We will share information on upcoming games when we have something cool to share.\" That, then, bodes well for the ever-elusive KOTOR remake, but it's far from the only game previously confirmed to be in development at Saber. The studio is also working on John Carpenter's Toxic Commando and Jurassic Park Survival, both scheduled to launch this year, with new Turok and Avatar: The Last Airbender games also on the way. And as for the newly announced Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 3, that sounds like it's still some considerable way out. The studio has said it still plans to support Space Marine 2 \"in the coming years\" while it continues work on its \"even more immersive\" sequel.",
