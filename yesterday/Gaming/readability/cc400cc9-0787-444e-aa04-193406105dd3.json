  "text": "Not the dreaded IP collab! Image credit: Blizzard/Rock Paper Shotgun Diablo 4 is coming up to its second anniversary but it still has a good bit of gas in the tank. Earlier today Blizzard shared its roadmap for the game across the rest of the year, though obviously we're a quarter of the way through that already. The game is currently in its seventh season, with its eighth, Belial's Return, starting sometime this month. This one, unsurprisingly, adds Belial, Lord of Lies as a boss, alongside a couple of bosses from Vessel of Hatred as \"part of the updated Lair Boss system.\" This is the part that isn't as fun though: that season will also be bringing in an \"IP collab.\" That's obviously a bit of a red flag, given how much Overwatch has fully lent into just ignoring the laws of its own universe with its own crossovers, but the blog post does note that the collab will feature \"universes that complement its dark themes.\" Universes, plural, because season ten, (we'll get there) also features a collab. Season nine, Sins of the Horadrim, starts in July and runs through to September, will bring in new powers, Nightmare dungeon activities, dungeon escalation, and an earnable pet. Aww! Then there's the aforementioned tenth season, which'll include the second collab of the year, as well as new chaos powers and an Infernal Hordes update (oh, and another earnable pet). There'll be some quality of life updates throughout the year too, like the Battle Pass and Seasonal Journey getting a refresh to help them \"evolve in ways that are more rewarding.\" There's no new expansion on the way this year though, with the roadmap noting the next one will be coming in 2026, alongside a new ranking system, leaderboards, and, uh, new something, that bit is obfuscated by some flames. Oops! Blizzard should take a look at that, can't read what's been burned away.",
