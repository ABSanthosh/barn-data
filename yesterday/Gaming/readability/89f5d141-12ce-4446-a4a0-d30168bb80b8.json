  "text": "If you have ever found yourself in an unfamiliar room, staring at a closed door and wondering what lies beyond it, then you are already familiar with the mysterious driving force of Blue Prince. Will this door lead to a twisting passageway? A quiet bedroom? Or a grand ballroom? My name is Tonda Ros, an indie developer with a love for atmospheric games, and for the last eight years, I have been working on a game about a large manor and its many mysterious doors. Blue Prince was formed from big ideas from very different worlds. It has elements of mystery, strategy and discovery, merging the world of a first-person puzzle adventure with the drafting mechanics of a tabletop card game. It also launches April 10 as a day one PlayStation Plus Game Catalog title.But how exactly does the game work? Floor plan drafting  When my own journey began almost a decade ago, I had one simple idea: “Every door is a choice.” In a way, these five words sum up the entirety of Blue Prince. The estate of Mount Holly is not an ordinary house. This is a manor of shifting rooms and ever-changing expectations. And in this house, each door you open can lead to one of three different rooms. The choice is up to you.  Do you want a storeroom to gain useful tools? A library to search for more clues? Or perhaps simply a long hallway, to grant yourself even more doors to continue your exploration? As you make your decision and open the door, you are instantly met with the room of your choosing. Constructing a shifting house Ironically, the process of creating this game is a lot like playing Blue Prince. Both the player and I are attempting to construct a shifting house of many rooms. A mansion that is full of challenges that we cannot foresee at the onset of our adventure. And to create this house, we build rooms, one at a time – door by door, blueprint by blueprint. The rooms we choose to draft are of course, entirely up to us. As we create, we are also able to explore, traveling from room to room in search of answers and clues. Where the player’s adventure begins to differ, however, is at the end of each in-game day. When you awake tomorrow, you will find the house you have been exploring will have a completely different layout. You will find doors that lead to new rooms. You will find different items, different clues and different puzzles. You will make new discoveries, and each day you will learn more and more about the strange rules that govern this mysterious house. Shifting puzzles Designing puzzles for a game taking place in an ever-changing mansion was a bit of a challenge. One player might find a puzzle in the mansion, and the very next room they draft might contain a clue for it.. For another, it may be dozens of rooms before they discover the secret. The beauty, of course, is this is actually what makes the experience special. The rooms you draft, the items you find, and the order in which you make discoveries all contribute to an adventure that will be wildly different from every other playthrough. Additionally, there is no puzzle in the game that must be solved. Like most things on the estate, there are always alternate avenues of progression to find and various solutions to the challenges you face. If you can’t figure something out in the game, don’t be afraid to move on. Exploring the manor will eventually lead you to the answers you are looking for, as most challenges in the game cannot be solved without finding more information and clues in other areas of the estate.  After eight years of development, I am finally at the end of my journey, and I am eager to hand over the keys to you so you can start your own. If you will allow me one final word of advice: the less you know about this game going in, the better. In this article, I have only given you a broad sense of the basic mechanics of my game and how I approached designing them. I will leave the evolution of these mechanics and the story of Mount Holly for you to discover yourself. But don’t worry, you won’t have to wait long. The doors of Blue Prince open April 10.
