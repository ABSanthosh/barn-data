  "text": "Who wants to be a millionaire?Earlier this month Roblox announced that its The Hunt: Mega Edition Event would come with a $1 million grand prize for one super skilled gamer, and today the event officially started, revealing the 25 different Roblox experiences players will need to compete in to walk away a millionaire. Roblox's last event, The Hunt: First Edition, attracted 34 million users without promising enough money to buy 1,428 PlayStation 5 Pros and still have money left over for a decent library of games, so expect The Hunt: Mega Edition to be the focus of the Roblox community until the event hits its live-streamed final in April. For that final the top ten The Hunt: Mega Edition competitors will be invited to Roblox HQ for their shot at the jackpot. The full list of 25 different Roblox experiences that make up The Hunt: Mega Edition Event are:A Dusty TripArsenalBasketball LegendsBayside High SchoolBlade LeagueClip ItCar Crushers 2Chained [2 Player Obby]Drive WorldEat the WorldFischHell's KitchenInfection GunfightIt GirlMetro LifeNatural Disaster SurvivalPet Simulator 99PRESSURERegretevatorRIVALSSpongeBob Tower DefenseTower Defense SimulatorUntitled Boxing GameUntitled Tag GameWorld ZeroThat's quite the variety, meaning to get to the big prize players will need to show their skills in games like life sim Bayside High School, cook up a storm as Gordon Ramsay's next executive chef in Hell's Kitchen and survive zombie FPS Infection Gunfight. The only catch is to win the money you need to be 13 years-old or over, but even if you out of the running for the cash there are still special ultra-rare digital items created exclusively for The Hunt: Mega Edition to win.
