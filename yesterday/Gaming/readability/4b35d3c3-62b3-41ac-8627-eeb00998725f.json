Right now Amazon has dropped the price of the 65\" LG Evo C4 4K OLED TV to $1,396.99. The LG Evo C-series of TVs - including this model - have consistently been our favorite high-end 4K TVs for HDR movie watching and current generation console gaming.65\" LG Evo C4 4K OLED Smart TV for $139765\" LG Evo C4 4K OLED Smart TVThe C4 is the 2024 model in LG's C-series OLED lineup. The LG Evo C5 hasn't yet been released, but it was showcased during CES 2025. At least on paper, the improvements of the C5 seem to be incremental, with no major ground breaking updates that would make you want to hold off until its launch. More importantly, the C5 will probably release at a very high retail price which will take months to get down to a level that's competitive with other TV deals.The C4 uses LG's Evo panel, which offers higher brightness levels than traditional OLED TVs. Compared to a standard LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times. Because of these advantages, the Evo OLED TV excels at displaying 4K HDR content in all of its intended glory. LG OLED TVs particular have been out for years and benefit from several generations of optimizations.The LG C4 also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV as well. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz and all four HDMI ports are 2.1 spec for running games in 4K at up to 120fps on a PS5 or Xbox Series X without any tearing. The C4 also supports variable refresh rate (VRR) and auto low latency mode (ALLM). The C4 is also easier to install than its predecessors; the rear cabinet housing is made of a composite fiber that weighs 36 pounds. Need a good soundbar to pair it with?Bose Smart Soundbar 550 with Dolby AtmosIf you bought a brand new TV over the holidays and you're looking for a good audio solution at an excellent price, then one of the best Black Friday deals is back. Walmart is currently offering the Bose Smart Soundbar 550 for just $199 with free shipping after a massive $300 off instant discount. At this price, it's certainly one of the best soundbars you can get, especially if you're looking for an affordable soundbar that supports Dolby Atmos.More Excellent OLED TV Deals Going on Right Now65\" LG Evo C3 4K OLED Smart TVIf you don't mind going a generation back, you can pick up a 2023 65\" LG Evo C3 4K OLED TV for just $1,196.99 with free shipping on Amazon. This is a better deal than what I saw during Black Friday. The 2024 C4 has minimal incremental upgrades over the 2023 C3, with the most noticeable improvements being an upgraded processor, newer WebOS smart interface, support for DTS audio, and a higher 144Hz refresh rate.55\" Sony Bravia XR A75L 4K OLED Google TV65\" Sony Bravia XR A75L 4K OLED Google TVIf you prefer Sony as your TV brand, then Best Buy has some great deals for this week.
