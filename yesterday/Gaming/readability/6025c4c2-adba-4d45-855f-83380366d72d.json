It's normally listed at $109.99, but you can get it on Amazon for $64.99 shipped after a $20 clippable coupon. Alternatively, you can get it at Arzopa for $63.99 shipped after you apply $5 coupon code \"AZP5263\". That's a great price compared to other 15\" USB Type-C monitors on Amazon. This is a great portable display for your Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, or Asus ROG Ally.Arzopa S1 15\" 1080p USB-C Portable Monitor for $63.99Arzopa 15.6\" 1080p USB Type-C Portable MonitorFor Arzopa direct, use $5 off promo code: AZP5263The Arzopa S1 is a 15\" 1080p monitor with both USB Type-C and mini HDMI ports to connect to a laptop, tablet, or gaming handhelf. It can work as a standalone or secondary display. If your device is equipped with a USB Type-C output with Power Delivery, then a single cable can be used for both video and power. Otherwise, you'll need two cables: a mini HDMI or USB Type-C cable for video and a second USB Type-C cable to a wall charger for power. USB Type-C cables are provided, however you'll have to supply your own HDMI cable and wall charger.The monitor is designed to be portable. It weighs only 1.3 pounds and measures 0.3\" thin. It sports a sturdy frame and includes a smart cover that doubles as a stand. The 15\" display features a 1080p resolution with 60Hz refresh rate, an IPS panel with great viewing angles, and an anti-glare matte surface. It even has built in speakers. This is an excellent way to boost your productivity by adding on a secondary display with minimal hassle and at an affordable price.Compatible with Nintendo Switch or Steam DeckThis monitor works quite well paired with a gaming handheld like the Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck. You will have to use the two-cable setup (one USB cable to the handheld, one USB cable to a wall charger) for this to work properly. The S1's 1080p 60Hz panel is a great matchup particularly for the Nintendo Switch, since the Switch only supports up to 720p @ 60Hz anyway. The Steam Deck or ROG Ally can support higher resolutions and refresh rates, but at that point you're really taxing your system, and 1080p/60Hz is an ideal balance between visual fidelity and playability. At 1080p, a 15\" display already boasts a very high 140ppi pixel density.Upgrade to the Arzopa Z1FC 16\" 144Hz Monitor for $102Arzopa Z1FC 16.1\" 1080p 144Hz USB Type-C Portable MonitorFor Arzopa direct, use $5 off promo code: AZP5263The higher end Arzopa Z1FC is also on sale. Amazon has it for $116.99, however Arzopa has it for $101.99 after you apply promo code \"AZP5263\". The Z1FC's upgrades include a larger display (16.1\" vs 15.6\"), a higher refresh rate (144Hz vs 60Hz), and better color reproduction (100% sRGB color gamut). The larger display and better color reproduction makes it a nice upgrade for Switch and Steam Deck. However, this monitor is better for gaming laptops and more powerful gaming handheld PCs like the ROG Ally X or the Legion Go, which have the horsepower to take advantage of the 144Hz refresh rate. I've owned and used this monitor for the past few years and recommend it.If you're looking for other USB monitor options, here are our top picks for the best portable monitors of 2025.
