  "text": "Jurassic World Evolution 2! Meat Boy! More! Image credit: Eurogamer Another week is upon us - and that means more Epic Games Store freebies, with the likes of Jurassic World Evolution 2 currently available for nowt. But things are a little bit different this time around; starting today, Epic is introducing weekly free games to its mobile store - available worldwide on Android devices and on iOS in the EU. As usual, Epic's latest free games are available for seven days - starting today, 20th March, and running through to next Thursday, 27th March. During that time, you can grab the following: Jurassic World Evolution 2 (PC) Super Meat Boy Forever (iOS/Android) Eastern Exorcist (iOS/Android) Jurassic World Evolution 2 | Launch Trailer Jurassic World Evolution 2 trailer.Watch on YouTube It's a decent line-up then, starting with Jurassic World Evolution 2 - Frontier Developments' dinosaur-themed park management sequel, in which players attempt to create a thriving dino attraction that, all being well, won't attempt to eat the guests. As for this week's mobile offerings, Super Meat Boy Forever is a good 'un, taking the twitchy platforming of developer Team Meat's 2010 classic and turning it into an endless runner. \"Super Meat Boy Forever does more with two buttons than most do with 14\", we wrote back in 2017. And finally, there's Eastern Exorcist - a side-scrolling action RPG set in a fantasy world of spirits and monsters. Epic notes this one's only available in certain regions, but doesn't say which. And if you're wondering what's coming next, you might have to wait a bit. Epic's breaking from tradition this week, and hasn't revealed what'll be replacing its current bunch of free games. Instead, its next two PC freebies are simply listed as \"mystery game\" over on its store. Epic, of course, launched its mobile store last August, following ceaseless legal activity and new EU regulations requiring major companies such as Apple to allow sideloading and alternate marketplaces on their devices. Not long after, Epic confirmed its free weekly games programme would be coming to mobile, and here we are now.",
