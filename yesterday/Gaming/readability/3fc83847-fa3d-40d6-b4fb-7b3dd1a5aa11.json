  "text": "We are once again on the path out of 2024 with what is sometimes my final reflective post to be written during the year. The year 2024 will be departing soon There is, at this point, a long tradition of such posts here at TAGN.  If you are sufficiently bored, you can indulge yourself with the musings of past years: Looking Back at 2023 Looking Back at 2022 Looking Back at 2021 Looking Back at 2020 Looking Back at 2019 Looking Back at 2018 Looking Back at 2017 Looking Back at 2016 Looking Back at 2015 Looking Back at 2014 Looking Back at 2013 Looking Back at 2012 Looking Back at 2011 Looking Back at 2010 Looking Back at 2006 Usually I do highs and lows.  Once I think I did highs, lows, and in between.  I must have been really bored. This year, in the face of literally everything getting worse (with a forecast of continued relentless worsening for the next 2-8 years) and the video game industry wrecking itself in the name of short term profits, I am going to try to list out just the highs for 2024. Now, if you’ve read the blog, you’ll know I probably won’t be able to avoid veering into sarcasm on some of this.  I can only be so good before I start to crack.  That and the constant typos are all the separate me from the AI menace at this point, so rest assured if you see yet another subject/verb mis-match, that this was human generated, pounded out by my frail human hands on a keyboard that probably needs to be cleaned. Anyway, let me see how far I can get with this. Microsoft Activision Blizzard acquisition complete so no more Bobby the Tick… that was last year actually, but still, fuck him Phil Spencer remains a modestly likeable heartless corporate tool World of Warcraft 20th anniversary Warcraft franchise 30th anniversary The War Within expansion has launched with interesting features Dragonflight now free to subscribers So many flavors of WoW Classic! WoW Classic Cataclysm WoW Classic simply vanilla WoW Classic Season of Discovery WoW Classic Hardcore WoW Classic Classic The promise of housing in retail WoW We will eventually be rescued from the malaise of Cataclysm Classic Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred launched Hearthstone keeps Hearthstoning... and didn’t we get Hearthstone Classic or something? OverWatch 2?  Was that a thing?  I still don’t know what it is, except that there is no PvE campaign A year with a “2” in it, so probably another Call of Duty game shipped XBox no doubt shipped some things and only raised prices a bit I guess CCP EVE Online Equinox and Revenant expansions landed Occasional indication that they fix things based on player feedback… though this would be more convincing if it wasn’t so often stuff that they broke or shipped broken EVE: Galaxy Conquest mobile title launched EVE Vanguard testing carries on EVE Online board game Kickstarter funded EVE Frontier moving into pre-apha Remains overall a contributing factor to the Pearl Abyss bottom line, ensuring its continued existence for now Didn’t actually lay off a huge percentage of staff… but none of its new projects has failed yet either Enad Global 7 The Year of Darkpaw EverQuest 25th anniversary EverQuest II 20th anniversary All the annual expansions! EverQuest – The Outer Brood EverQuest II – Scars of Destruction Lord of the Rings Online – Legacy of Morgoth Whatever it is DDO, DCUO, and PlanetSide do for new content… Palia acquisition, the first new Daybreak title ever My Singing Monsters still rolling hard, even if down some A hint of a glimpse of a new EverQuest title Managed to stave off shareholder demands to sell itself to larger competitor Other MMO and Online Game Things Pokemon Go hasn’t been wrecked by Niantic bad ideas yet, though this whole trying to make Dynamax a thing isn’t working on me Throne and Liberty launched Tarisland went live and New World on consoles at last… expected that last year, but hey! Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds launched, bringing housing to the game Path of Exile 2 early access arrived Playable Worlds gave us a pre-alpha glimpse at Stars Reach Star Citizen… I guess proves that gamers will throw money at hope for a better game Enshrouded came in solid and go some good updates Sons of the Forest arrived Nightingale showed up Valheim gave us the Ashlands Conan Exiles had a whole new map and a UI revamp No Man’s Sky remains an amazing turn around with more new content Patheon: Rise of the Fallen made it to early access Other Video Game Items Have I mentioned Balatro yet?  It is all that for a solitaire card game for me A shout out to GoG.com for keeping some games alive, like Combat Mission: Barbarossa to Berlin Despite my blase attitude towards the event, the Steam Winter Sale still has some tempting deals… it is only the size of my library and the number of unplayed titles that restrains me Oh, and Steam hasn’t gone evil on us yet… but being privately held means they don’t feel like they have to grab every loose nickel in our pockets… Homeworld 3 finally saw the light of day Dragon Age: Veilguard revives the series Cat Quest III continues the series Half-life 2 and Counter-Strike Source reach the 20 year mark Blogs, Social Media, Media, and Online Life The blog abides – TAGN made it past the 18 year mark In 2024 TAGN, despite… or maybe because of… all the garbage going on in the world, actually saw an uptick in readership Google search continues to accept my existence and send people to the blog WordPress.com, despite all its drama and bad updates, hasn’t broken their platform yet The blogging community likewise abides Hey, we even had a pretty good Blaugust Blue Sky has shaped up nicely and isn’t owned by a right-wing billionaire eager to suppress speech they don’t like (You’ll say “X” and I’ll point to Threads as well) Mastodon likewise hangs on, having grabbed that “Linux of social media” corner Some actual good Hollywood movies this year… I mean yes, there were also stinkers like Borderlands, but you’ll always get some of that Despite some questionable moves… like ads in all the things… streaming services have managed to put out some decent content like: Amazon Prime Video: Cross, Fallout, The Boys new season Apple TV+ : New seasons for Shrinking, Slow Horses, Silo Hulu: The Bear, Shogun HBO Max Whatever: Dune: Prophecies, The Penguin Meanwhile Netflix remains in a league of its own for new content… I could write a whole post about how they are constantly putting up new stuff and don’t feel the need to drag things out with weekly episodes to keep you from cancelling because you won’t cancel because there is always something new While we are constantly bombarded by AI nonsense, at least the metaverse hype has finally gone quiet… if only crypto would go away as well… but too many billionaires see too much potential to rob the general public via crypto, so it remains As usual… actually, more that usual… I did this very much as a stream of consciousness post which means, here at the end of the year I am quite likely to have forgotten anything that happened early on.  Sometimes I start this post a couple months in advance. This year it was very last minute. So what did I miss from the above niches or other aspects of 2024?",
