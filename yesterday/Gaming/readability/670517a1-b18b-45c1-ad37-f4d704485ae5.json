Warning: The post below answers none of the questions it asks and arrives at no satisfying conclusion.  It is also rambling, laced with emotion and bile, and may not be 100% factually correct.  Proceed with caution. Somehow digital ownership has come around again as a topic, this time seemingly from two sources.  One was a PC Gamer article that I have seen mentioned a few places about a “secret” Steam page where you can see exactly how much money you’re spent on the site.  (The page is here… and if you’re interested, you can see your Steam Points totals too here.) Granted, SteamDB has been giving you estimates of your spend for more than a decade on their Steam Calculator page at this point.  But those are estimates, the Steam page gives you the precise dollar amount.  For me the number is $2,673.62. Not a huge number, but I have always been a bit cagey about digital purchases, based on age and experience and rightly earned distrust of corporations. The other recent item in the mix … well, it isn’t recent, it was something announced a freaking year ago, but it continues to fester due to corporate behavior that boarders on malpractice… is the removal of access to The Crew by the awful UbiSoft, a company that feels it must demonstrate its contempt for its customers at least semi-annually.  The Crew, for clarification, has an online aspect, but also contains an offline single player campaign that has approximately 20 hours of content.  However, it was built as a “must connect to the mothership” title so turning off the servers also turns off the single player content because the game cannot reach out and validate your copy. Instead, when you attempted to access the game you were prompted to check out one of the sequels to The Crew, UbiSoft being unable to keep from making a bad situation worse.  There wasn’t even a discount coupon, just “Go buy the next game peon!”  I mean, these guys stand out as snotty and arrogant even in France. I am vaguely more aware of The Crew than other UbiSoft titles because when EA was shutting down Need for Speed: World it was suggested that The Crew might be a possible title to get a similar experience… like anybody was going to replicate me literally surfing my Nissan Silvia over a field of police cars. I will get away, you watch! I miss that particular aspect of the game, and will probably never experience anything like it again.  It was, in many ways, a very silly game. (Also, lest I forget, EA shuts down nearly every online title it produces… they just aren’t quite as obnoxious about it as UbiSoft… but I still avoid EA products now as well.) Already not a fan of UbiSoft… I think they were in the midst of the customer hating spasm where they claimed 95% of the people playing their titles on PC were doing so without paying and PC players in general were awful people if they weren’t giving them money now… I gave The Crew a wide berth, and feel vindicated in that choice. Anyway, that gave rise to protests from the digital rights and video game preservationists because this is exactly the sort of thing they get on about.  UbiSoft, sticking to its need to inflame any situation, waved the license agreement around like a bloody shirt declaring that people never really owned the game and so have no “rights” to anything, ever! So it goes. You do not, in any legal way, own your digital purchases.  The fine print you brush past when you sign up with or make a purchase from Amazon, Steam, Apple, Comcast, or whoever makes that 100% legally clear.  Those companies owe you nothing for your money, can revoke your access at any time, and your limited allotted paths for recourse are usually limited to binding arbitration before an arbitrator paid for and owned by the company in question.  Make no mistake, the arbitrator is a formality and will never decide against the company because if they did the company would cease to pay them for their services and go elsewhere. That is the legal system as designed by corporations. So I am on board with the digital rights people, if only to set some legal boundaries for corporations as to what their actual obligations are.  Because the obligations should be more that “none,” which is the current state of affairs.  Can we agree on that? Companies only pretend they have some obligations because it would be pretty bad for business if they presented the reality of the situation up front, that you get nothing if they decide that is what they want. That brings up the question of how long should access last?  Let’s skip pretending it is ownership.  How long should you be able to read, listen to, watch, play, or otherwise engage with your purchases in a meaningful way? Forever? Forever is a long time.  Bhagpuss lays out why forever is unrealistic, but even the longest term allowed in the US for a binding contract, which is 99 years, seems like an awful long time.  I have recently passed the 60 year mark and so much has changed in my lifetime, since the turn of the century, even in the last decade, that 99 years seems like too much. So how long?  What is a reasonable number?  20 years?  10 years?  5 years?  A year?  A month?  24 hours? I have had digital purchases with no posted expiration date become inaccessible in under a year. I have had things removed from my account by Amazon, Comcast, Apple, and Google, things that I paid to access, in under 12 months.  There were a variety of reasons, not all of them mere corporate greed, though that was the sole reason in the case of Comcast and you should never “purchase” to “own” a digital asset from them ever. In the case of Amazon, it involved a licensing issue that they knew would come up and should have alerted me to… except, of course, had they done so I probably wouldn’t have made the purchase.  So, instead, their rights to distribute a particular book digitally in the US expired and they yoinked it from my Kindle app and account with a barely a “yeah, sorry” to go with it.  There were certainly no refunds offered in any of the cases, nor even store credit or a “discount on next purchase” offer. It isn’t a common event.  The four companies I mentioned only did it to me once in the “under a year” time frame, and I had to reach back 15 years for the Apple and Comcast actions.  So if you’re response is an immediate, “It has never happened to me!” that seems plausible.  It might never.  It might tomorrow.  And if I extend the horizon beyond 12 months I can come up with a pile of such things from Amazon, mostly through their Audible.com audio book franchise. Now, I’m past the 25 year mark of being an Audible.com customer, so some entropy is to be expected I suppose.  But, fine print, incontestable, legalese licensing agreements aside, no company ever comes up out up front and says “This item will probably not be available to you in a few years.”  No company goes out of its way to even imply your purchase isn’t forever.  What is it they say about lying by omission?  Oh yeah, that it is still a lie! Of course, no company will ever willingly suggest that your purchase isn’t at least a lifetime engagement because to remind you that they will eventually remove access to your purchase might make you reconsider spending the money.  That might keep the line from going up, and the line must always go up! So maybe we need some sort of consumer protection regulation around that.  That seems like a viable option.  Who could possibly object to that?  Certainly not the miscreants who seem to take the side of corporations when they remove access, with insightful comments like “didn’t you read the licensing agreement?” or “What did you expect?” Maybe the EU will get to work on that.  Or maybe they already have.  It is hard to know from here in the US where the entire country has been sold to corporations who are now in the process of dismantling anything that might stand in the way of maximizing profit.  A century of work to make food, water, medicine, and consumer goods safe is being put to the torch so Jeff Bezos will be able to afford as many new trophy wives as his heart desires. We will soon have no consumer protection at all at the federal level and the Republicans will no doubt forbid the states to have any such laws at the local level.  The executive order will go out, the Republican congress will do nothing, and the bought and paid for majority on the Supreme Court will rule in favor of whoever paid for their latest trip or let them use their private jet or bought them a shiny new motor home. However, while I am fine with the EU going down that path… again, consumer protection is a thing of the past in the US now… there is literally a massive e.coli outbreak right now and the government is trying to hush it up because, as we learned during Covid, Republicans would rather people die than business lose a nickel… I am less on board with the video game preservationist path. I mean, given the number of old games I play and how I was pining just a few paragraphs up to once again surf my Nissan Silvia over a field of police cars in Need for Speed World, you might assume I would be totally on board with their agenda. And I kind of am.  I do like remakes and companies that bring back old titles that were good in their own special way.  I like that I can still play Civilization II.  I like that Blizzard found somebody who could recreate Diablo II with updated graphics that so captured the feel of the original that I had to see the original to remind myself that it was all new.  I like that Nintendo goes back and revamps old version of Pokemon on the latest platform.  I am also not against people trying to recreate pirate servers of various dead MMOs. What I am not on board with is any regulatory requirement that any online game be made available forever, which is what the more extreme elements of the preservationist faction is asking for.  This goes back to the above.  Maybe there is some threshold before which a company has some obligation… but where to we even begin to try to set that line? It seems unworkable from a practical sense.  If a company goes out of business, if the devs have all gone off to other jobs, if EA or some other company buys up the assets and the rights, who is supposed to be held to account?  It seems unworkable. Which brings me back around the UbiSoft.  As awful as they are, as badly as they handle relationships with customers, I think they are within their rights to shut down The Crew and not give two fetid dingo’s kidney about the consequences.  Who are you or I to tell them how to run their business? I also think gamers should remember that and not buy their games if they are going to be treated like dirt.  I would certainly never spend money on a UbiSoft title.  But then along comes the latest Assassin’s Creed title and everybody flocks to it and UbiSoft is rewarded, facing no consequences at all for past behavior. So if companies like UbiSoft are shitty to their customers and people still buy their stuff… what have we learned?  If you want preservation, maybe support companies who put in the effort?",

We will soon have no consumer protection at all at the federal level and the Republicans will no doubt forbid the states to have any such laws at the local level.  The executive order will go out, the Republican congress will do nothing, and the bought and paid for majority on the Supreme Court will rule in favor of whoever paid for their latest trip or let them use their private jet or bought them a shiny new motor home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, while I am fine with the EU going down that path… again, consumer protection is a thing of the past in the US now… there is literally a massive e.coli outbreak right now and the government is trying to hush it up because, as we learned during Covid, Republicans would rather people die than business lose a nickel… I am less on board with the video game preservationist path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, given the number of old games I play and how I was pining just a few paragraphs up to once again surf my Nissan Silvia over a field of police cars in \u003cem\u003eNeed for Speed World\u003c/em\u003e, you might assume I would be totally on board with their agenda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I kind of am.  I do like remakes and companies that bring back old titles that were good in their own special way.  I like that I can still play \u003cem\u003eCivilization II\u003c/em\u003e.  I like that Blizzard found somebody who could recreate \u003cem\u003eDiablo II\u003c/em\u003e with updated graphics that so captured the feel of the original that I had to see the original to remind myself that it was all new.  I like that Nintendo goes back and revamps old version of \u003cem\u003ePokemon\u003c/em\u003e on the latest platform.  I am also not against people trying to recreate pirate servers of various dead MMOs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I am not on board with is any regulatory requirement that any online game be made available forever, which is what the more extreme elements of the preservationist faction is asking for.  This goes back to the above.  Maybe there is some threshold before which a company has some obligation… but where to we even begin to try to set that line?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems unworkable from a practical sense.  If a company goes out of business, if the devs have all gone off to other jobs, if EA or some other company buys up the assets and the rights, who is supposed to be held to account?  It seems unworkable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich brings me back around the UbiSoft.  As awful as they are, as badly as they handle relationships with customers, I think they are within their rights to shut down \u003cem\u003eThe Crew\u003c/em\u003e and not give two fetid dingo’s kidney about the consequences.  Who are you or I to tell them how to run their business?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also think gamers should remember that and not buy their games if they are going to be treated like dirt.  I would certainly never spend money on a UbiSoft title.  But then along comes the latest \u003cem\u003eAssassin’s Creed\u003c/em\u003e title and everybody flocks to it and UbiSoft is rewarded, facing no consequences at all for past behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo if companies like UbiSoft are shitty to their customers and people still buy their stuff… what have we learned?  If you want preservation, maybe support companies who put in the effort?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
