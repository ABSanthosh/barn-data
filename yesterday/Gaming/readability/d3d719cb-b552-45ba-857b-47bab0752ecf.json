  "text": "I think the overall message for this year’s Steam Replay is pretty much the same as for past years, which is that I do not actually play that many video games.  Some people on my friends list have a couple times as many titles on their list. Or maybe it is just not that many games on Steam… which is kind of odd, because Steam is the home for most of the video games I “own,” for whatever definition of digital ownership is current at the moment.  Certainly the licensing agreements everywhere make it clear that I don’t “own” anything anymore when it comes to most video games. Anyway, I did play some games on Steam.  Almost twice as many as I did last year according to the top level summary. Steam Replay Summary 2024 20 games is a lot of games for me.  Or maybe it is 21.  Steam seems a bit fuzzy on the details. Here it says the total is 21 I thought maybe I played another new game after the initial tally… but no.  Not according to Steam at least, and it is Steam that won’t give me a straight answer. Either way that is, according to Steam, at least twice as many games as I played on the service in 2023.  And more games than most people I guess.  The people on my friends list with much larger numbers are outliers.  The stats seem to indicate that most people don’t play that many different games at all on Steam. Steam Replay 2024 Comparison The median number… not the average number, but the middle number if you sorted them all numerically… of games played by Steam users is four.  So at 21… or even at last year’s 10… I am on the far side of the median where I bet the near side includes a lot of people who just play their one game on Steam. 84 achievements is once again on the far side of the median as well as being considerably more than the 17 I earned in 2023. And my longest playing streak was 77 days, between February 8th and April 25th, which covers the last round with Valheim, Balatro, a bit of Elder Scrolls Online, and the dive into Conan Exiles. Steam also divides up the games you play into buckets labeled “new releases,” “recent favorites,” and “classic games” and compares your play percentages against the community overall. Steam Replay 2024 Age Buckets Surprisingly I played more new games on average than the community, though I guess that is only a surprise if you show up with the assumption that Steam is a hardcore gaming platform. I mostly played Recent Favorites, which aligned with the community.  However, in the Classic Games category, where you would think I would be a heavy hitter, I only hit the 10% mark while the community overall was close to 40%.  That also seems to reinforce a bit my new working hypothesis that the average Steam user probably has their game… or a couple of games… that they play and they don’t move on or play much new or indulge in the frequent Steam sales. Which brings us to what did I actually play.  Steam has a graphic for that. Steam Replay 2024 – All The Games See, 21 games Steam.  Was it that hard? The top five titles are probably not a surprise to any regular reader.  I wrote about all of them.  In fact, I think I have at least one post about every title in that top row. Of the list, 18 were new to me in 2024.  I know Astro Colony doesn’t have that “first played” red banner, but I must have bought it and played it just before the cut-off because it was one of my Winter Sale purchases from last year and does not appear in my 2023 Replay. Another item Steam Replay covers is how many titles you played on Steam for each month.  My peak was January, when I played eight titles as I was sorting out the Valheim-like titles, some of which I had picked up at the Steam Winter Sale 2023.  The quietest months were July and October, when I was played just No Man’s Sky and Stars Reach respectively. Then there is the attempt to categorize what I played. Steam Replay 2024 – The Graph I feel like that doesn’t quite tell the tale.  Or that some titles do not have all the right tags.  Valheim, Conan Exiles, and Enshrouded we played as online co-op, but I suspect that at least Conan doesn’t count, being as heavy on PvP emphasis as it is. One missing statistic is how many games did I purchase in 2024 and not play.  That number is four games by my calculation.  I have yet to get to Combat Mission: Cold War, Unity of Command II, Strategic Command WWII, and Nightingale.  Three war games I think I’ll play and one survival builder that I am sure I’ll get to once Enshrouded wears off. Anyway, that is my Steam Replay for 2024.  You can click on that link and go see it for yourself should you be so inclined. Now, will I play anything new in 2025?  Will I buy anything during the Steam Winter Sale? Past Steam Replay Posts: My Steam Replay for 2023 My Steam Replay for 2022",

titles are probably not a surprise to any regular reader.  I wrote about all of them.  In fact, I think I have at least one post about every title in that top row.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf the list, 18 were new to me in 2024.  I know \u003cem\u003eAstro Colony\u003c/em\u003e doesn’t have that “first played” red banner, but I must have bought it and played it just before the cut-off because it was one of my Winter Sale purchases from last year and does not appear in my 2023 Replay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother item Steam Replay covers is how many titles you played on Steam for each month.  My peak was January, when I played eight titles as \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2024/01/09/waiting-for-valheim-or-something-like-it/\"\u003eI was sorting out the \u003cem\u003eValheim\u003c/em\u003e-like titles\u003c/a\u003e, some of which I had picked up at the Steam Winter Sale 2023.  The quietest months were July and October, when I was played just \u003cem\u003eNo Man’s Sky\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eStars Reach\u003c/em\u003e respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there is the attempt to categorize what I

right tags.  \u003cem\u003eValheim, Conan Exiles,\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eEnshrouded\u003c/em\u003e we played as online co-op, but I suspect that at least \u003cem\u003eConan\u003c/em\u003e doesn’t count, being as heavy on PvP emphasis as it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne missing statistic is how many games did I purchase in 2024 and not play.  That number is four games by my calculation.  I have yet to get to \u003cem\u003eCombat Mission: Cold War, Unity of Command II, Strategic Command WWII\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eNightingale\u003c/em\u003e.  Three war games I think I’ll play and one survival builder that I am sure I’ll get to once \u003cem\u003eEnshrouded\u003c/em\u003e wears off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, that is \u003ca

inclined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, will I play anything new in 2025?  Will I buy anything during the Steam Winter Sale?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePast Steam Replay
