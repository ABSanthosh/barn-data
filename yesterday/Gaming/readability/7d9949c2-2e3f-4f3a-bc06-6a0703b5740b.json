Timothée Chalamet-verse essentials like Wonka and Denis Villeneuve’s Dune duology sit side by side with acerbic dramedies like The Righteous Gemstones and The White Lotus. But if you’re new to the platform you may be wondering how you can upgrade the viewing experience and ensure you’re watching all of your most anticipated movies and TV shows in the highest fidelity possible. If that’s you, read on, as our guide will explain the ins and outs of how to stream Max movies and shows in 4K – if you aren’t doing so already.How to Stream Max in 4KWhen it comes to picking a subscription plan for Max, there are three options available: Basic with Ads, Standard, and Premium. As with most streaming platforms (like Netflix), the only plan that allows for 4K streaming is the most expensive Premium plan. It’s also worth noting that Max also offers a bundle that includes Max, Disney+ and Hulu at a discounted price. However, while there are two bundle options – With Ads and No Ads – neither plan includes the 4K Premium Plan features at this time. This means you won’t have access to 4K streaming if you end up going with the multi-platform bundle.Here are the current Max U.S. plans and their prices:Basic with Ads - $9.99/month (No 4K)Standard - $16.99/month (No 4K)Premium - $20.99/month (Includes 4K)Is your streaming set-up 4K compatible?Once you’ve chosen your plan, you’ll need to verify that your setup can handle streaming Max’s 4K content. This means that your display, whether it be a monitor or a Smart TV, must support 4K resolution streaming. Furthermore, any external streaming devices like an Apple TV or Roku device must support 4K. Because you’re here on IGN, it’s worth pointing out that if you’re using a console like a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X to stream content, you already have an external device that supports streaming Max in 4K. Last but certainly not least, the cables and ports you’re using to link your TV and external device need to be high quality, or this could cause issues with 4K streaming. External devices will need to be plugged into a HDCP 2.2 HDMI port using a High-Speed 4K HDMI cable to make the most of 4K streaming on Max.If you’d like to check whether your current equipment is up to the task, Max has a list of compatible devices on their website that you can refer to.Is your internet connection strong enough?Beyond devices and cables, your internet connection also needs to be strong enough to stream content in 4K. MAX suggests a minimum of 25Mbps, but recommends 50Mbps for the best results. It’s worth mentioning that there is no account setting to force Max to stream in 4K, and Max will just adjust its streaming quality in accordance with your ‘network bandwidth and connection speed.’ So if the requirements are met, applicable content on Max should automatically stream in 4K. You can check whether the content you’re looking to watch is available in 4K, by selecting the film or tv show from the in-app menu and looking for the ‘4K’ or ‘4K UHD’ tag underneath the title. Are There Other Ways to Watch HBO Movies and Shows in 4K?HBO has a reputation for producing legendarily bingeable box sets like The Sopranos and Succession. Thanks to the popularity of said shows and their avid fan bases, many of these titles have been released physically as 4K Blu-ray box sets. George R. R. Martin acolytes can find the full Game of Thrones series in 4K, as well as the first two series of its drama-filled prequel House of the Dragon. Many of the movies available on MAX also have a physical Blu-Ray counterpart, such as 2024’s Twisters and 2021’s The Matrix Resurrections.As we’re often reminded, we don’t actually own the digital content we pay for. This means that owning the physical versions of your favourite films or TV shows is the only way to ensure the content can be rewatched forever – regardless of a faulty internet connection or future licensing issues.Originally posted: May 3, 2025 8:30 pm",
