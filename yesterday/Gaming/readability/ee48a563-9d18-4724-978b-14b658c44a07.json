This moment was the beginning of a multi-decade journey to turn car lovers into gamers, and gamers into car lovers, one that would eventually lead us to the vibrant community we have today – a community driven by car passion, racing skills, competition and creativity. Over the years that followed our debut game in 2005, we continued exploring our vision of creating innovative and immersive automotive experiences with the release of Forza Motorsport 2, 3, and 4 on Xbox 360; Forza Motorsport 5, 6, and 7 on Xbox One, and most recently, Forza Motorsport on Xbox Series X|S and PC. With less than two months until the 20th anniversary, today we are excited to share with you a preview of the content that will be available in Forza Motorsport as part of our May update, which includes the eagerly awaited return of a track considered truly legendary in the Forza community. Since the release of Forza Motorsport in October 2023, our team has been fully recreating Fujimi Kaido to modern standards in our biggest track project ever! Race and drift on the Full Circuit or Full Circuit Reverse that stretches 10.24 miles (16.5 km) in length featuring 144 extreme turns and a 2,711-foot (826 meters) summit. Our goal is to recapture the magic of drifting with your friends on the massive stretches of serpentine Japanese mountain roads at Fujimi Kaido, and we can’t wait for you to slide sideways once again as we now work to refine and polish this Forza original track for integration into the game this May. Fujimi Kaido is only the start of our upcoming anniversary content in Forza Motorsport. There are also some highly requested cars coming to the game, in addition to unlockable driver suits, special events in both Career and Featured Multiplayer, new themed Rivals challenges, and more. We will have more to share about the Forza Motorsport 20th anniversary as we approach the release of the update in May. Stay tuned to our @ForzaMotorsport social channels on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Discord, and X (formerly Twitter) for those details, where you can also let us know your favorite Forza Motorsport memories by using #ForzaMotorsport20. Plus, subscribe to the Forza Newsletter to be informed about everything that’s happening both in the game and our community – you will also receive the bonus Otherworld Driver Suit in Forza Motorsport just for signing up. It's been an incredible 20 years of racing and drifting. We look forward to sharing this anniversary with you, our players – let’s celebrate this milestone together on the track in Forza Motorsport.",
