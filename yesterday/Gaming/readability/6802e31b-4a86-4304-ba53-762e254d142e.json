  "text": "As fans come to terms with the GTA 6 delay - from creating countdowns \"that are cheaper than therapy\" to pleas to \"calm ourselves\" - at least one person is delighted by the news: Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 actor, Luke Dale. Dale, who portrayed Hans Capon in the game, took a glass-half view on the delay, writing on X/Twitter: \"WE'RE IN WITH A SHOT! GOTY!\", appending the hashtag #KCD2. Here's Eurogamer's Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review.Watch on YouTube You see, while players have been salivating for the next instalment of the universally-acclaimed series - so much so that Take-Two Interactive boss Strauss Zelnick acknowledged the fervor for GTA 6 is \"the greatest anticipation [he's] ever seen for an entertainment property\" - developers and publishers of other games targeting a similar release window were understandably worried about accidentally butting up against GTA 6's launch. Even Gearbox's Randy Pitchford was forced to strenuously deny that bringing Borderlands 4's release date forward had anything to do with GTA 6 (which turned out to be true). And of course, Luke Dale is not the only person in the games industry to have puffed out a sigh of relief yesterday - he just chose to do so publicly. The silver lining now is that games that have already released in 2025 - and those that had been holding back on solidifying release dates until GTA 6'a launch was confirmed - can feel more confident about securing an accolade or two in award ceremonies or best games of 2025 lists (thanks, GamesRadar+). We gave Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 three out of five stars, writing: \"This gorgeous medieval RPG continues to be just as divisive, prickly and abrasive as its predecessor.\" Following a hugely successful launch that saw over 1m people snapping up Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 in just 24 hours, developer Warhorse Studios continues to plug away at its post-release roadmap, mostly recently adding mod support, a barber shop, and \"over a thousand\" fixes and improvements. Yesterday, Rockstar announced it was delaying the launch of GTA 6 to 2026. The highly-anticipated sequel will now arrive for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th May 2026. Rockstar's confirmation of a delay follows months of speculation over whether the game would still make its 2025 launch window, despite assurances from Take-Two that the game was still on track. No other information was announced by Rockstar at the time. Rockstar released GTA 6's first - and so far only - look at the game back in December 2023.",
