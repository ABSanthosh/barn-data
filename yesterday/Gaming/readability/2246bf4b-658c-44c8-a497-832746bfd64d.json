  "text": "Toem 2 is all about helping people using your camera and photography skills, doing so by finding the little details within your world. It is a brilliant little game where you play as a curious photographer looking to collect stamps by helping people within the town you live in. You have a camera that allows you to take pictures and capture the world around you. People in your town all seem to get a lot of joy (and assistance) out of the photos you take! You can use your camera to collect the different birds and animals that roam the area or you can use it to solve little puzzles and bring joy to those that need help. One of the people in your town, for example, wants to know where their gnome went. You can take a photo and present it to them, letting them know where the gnome ended up. These quirky little puzzles are what the game is all about. Each one that you solve in Toem 2 gives you a stamp that you can place in your own stamp book. It just all feels very cozy and warming, as you take your camera and find your own perspective on the world. Some of the photos you take can change the environment to help you discover something new, and others can just be taken because you want them. There isn’t a timer or any sort of rush in Toem 2, giving you the freedom to explore as you want and solve quests whenever you feel like it. Toem 2 is a sequel to Toem, which looks to be very much the same vibes but with different quests and uses for your camera. I got the chance to play the sequel at the European Game Showcase where I really enjoyed diving in and spending time within this quirky world. It is black and white, and I do personally wish there was color, but otherwise it feels like a warm Sunday morning! Toem 2 is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can add it to your Steam Wishlist.
