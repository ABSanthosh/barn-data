  "description": "Numerous dangers await you in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl. You'll have to contend with nefarious bandits and hostile factions, as well as a slew of rabid mutants and unstable anomalies. In one particular instance, you also need to fight off drowsiness that leads to death. Here's our guide on how to complete the Poppy Field quest in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl.How to complete the Poppy Field quest in Stalker 2: Heart of ChornobylThe Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl Poppy Field quest takes place in the Lesser Zone, the initial area where you begin the campaign proper. Our guide discusses the mission objectives, the eerie location itself, and the rewards that you can receive. Poppy Field location and quest startThe Poppy Field mission comes from an NPC named Mityay. You can find him the building with your personal quarters and stash in the village of Zalissya. Mityay tells you about a Religious Icon that he's left behind and the Poppy Field should appear as a point-of-interest.The Poppy Field is located northwest of Zalissya, at the border's edge of the Lesser Zone region. Before you head there, make sure you have a couple of Non-Stop Energy Drinks. You're gonna need these for what comes next. Fighting off drowsiness in the Poppy FieldWhen you approach the Poppy Field in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, your first impression might be that it's a quaint and scenic place, especially with the red flowers all in bloom. Don't let the majestic beauty of this location fool you, because walking in the fields actually causes your character to get drowsy. At first, Skif's vision will go dim, and you'll even hear voices at certain areas. At certain points, you might even get teleported to odd locations, such as rooftops.To combat drowsiness, you need to drink a Non-Stop Energy Drink. However, the effects are only temporary, and you really can't stay out in the open for long. Otherwise, your character will collapse and die, and you have to reload your last save. Meeting with PomorAt the eastern edge of the village, there's one house that's occupied. Inside, you'll find a fella named Pomor. He has the following proposition:He can tell you the exact location of the Religious Icon if you pay him 2,000 coupons.Alternatively, you can help him with a task, which involves delivering some weapons and items to him.You don't need to pick either of these, since we can just tell you the location. Religious Icon locationTo get the Religious Icon, you need to find the cellar in the Poppy Field. Here's what you need to do:From Pomor's house, cross the field until you reach the gap between the two abandoned buildings.At the gap, walk straight ahead going west.In this sea of red flowers, you should spot a hole in the ground.Climb down the ladder to reach the cellar and pick up the Religious Icon. Rewards: Should you give the Religious Icon to Pomor or to MityayNow, you have to choose who gets the Religious Icon:If you pick Pomor, he'll give you the Unknown Stalker's AR416. This assault rifle, sadly, has low durability, and the repair might cost a bit much. A notification will also tell you that you can sell the Religious Icon to Pomor, though this step seems to be bugged so you can just ignore it. The quest will be completed automatically anyway.Alternatively, you can return all the way back to Zalissya so you can give the Religious Icon to Mityay. You'll receive 1,000 coupons for your efforts.That does it for our guide on how to complete the Poppy Field quest in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl. This is just one of many side quests that lead you to all sorts of odd locations in the Exclusion Zone.",
