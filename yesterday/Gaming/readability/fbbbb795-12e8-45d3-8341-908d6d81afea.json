  "text": "Apex predators are on the move in Call of Duty®: Mobile Season 5 — Primal Reckoning. Deploy to the Zoo Multiplayer map, apply new skins to your Combat Axe and Smoke Grenade, and wield the new VMP SMG. In Battle Royale, visit Buy Stations around the map; eliminate enemies to take their cash for your next purchase. The new Battle Pass brings a collection of Operator Skins, Weapon Blueprints, and more with a futuristic dystopian theme inspired by the season’s collaboration with NieR: Automata, including a themed event featuring the Kui Ji - YoRHa No. 9 Type S operator and two Draws featuring the operators Kestrel - YoRHa No. 2 Type B and Fiona St. George - Commander White. Season 5 — Primal Reckoning launches on May 28 at 5PM PT. Take a Trip to the Zoo First making its appearance in the original Call of Duty®: Black Ops, Zoo returns for its debut on mobile. The mid-sized map challenges Operators to survive in an abandoned zoo featuring a massive monorail track cutting through the aging facility. Well suited to the season’s dystopian theme, Zoo offers a creative layout incorporating animal pens, gift shops, and other attractions in an overgrown, dilapidated setting. Battle Royale: Buy Machines Gear Up With Buy Machines Buy Machines are deploying in Battle Royale on the Isolated Map in Season 5, offering another means of getting ahead of the competition! Purchase weapons, Perks, and Scorestreaks from the multiple Buy Stations that spawn across the map. Loot the environment for cash to purchase useful items like armor and ammo refills, unique weapons like the Purifier flamethrower, and different types of Perks. Eliminated Operators will drop their currency, so scoop it up and buy something nice for yourself. Don’t forget to watch your back while shopping! New Themed Event: NieR: Automata NieR: Automata Take command of the elite YorHa Unit as they launch a counteroffensive against the Machine Lifeforms in an exciting collaborative event with NieR: Automata. Complete objectives to earn action points which can be spent to move through a branching path.     Reach checkpoints, navigate counterattack routes, and collect Skill Chips to unlock exclusive routes. Conduct the counterattack successfully to earn rewards like the Kui Ji - YoRHa No. 9 Type S operator and four different melee weapons themed around NieR. Primal Reckoning Battle Pass: New Weapon, Combat Axe Reskin The Primal Reckoning Pass features free and premium items including new Operator Skins, Weapon Blueprints, Calling Cards, and additional Call of Duty® Points to spend on your next Premium Pass or Store purchase. Battle Pass Free Tiers Keep the enemy at bay with the new VMP SMG, a versatile weapon with a high fire rate, high magazine capacity, and moderate recoil. Apply a new look to the Combat Axe with a reskin for the deadly throwable and earn other free tier rewards including a variety of Skins, Weapons Blueprints, Vault Coins, and more. Premium Pass Tiers Purchase the Premium Pass for the chance to earn all the content in the Primal Reckoning stream, including relentless hunters like Gustavo — Viciousness, Lazarus — Scrim Net, American Bulldog — Tentacles, and Kitsune – Blue Line Optic. Track your prey and eliminate the target with Weapon Blueprints like the Koshka — Snow Leopard, Hades — Scales, ASM10 — Birds of Prey, LW3-Tundra — Hunter Tracker, and the VMP — Stun Slash, based on the new Season 5 weapon. Battle Pass Subscription: Enlist with the Ground Forces by purchasing a Battle Pass Subscription, granting additional monthly rewards along with a 10% boost to Player and Weapon XP, discount coupons, and limited discounts on 10x crate pulls. The Season 5 Ground Forces will unlock the Baker — Cobra Hunter Operator Skin, MSMC — Snake Weapon Blueprint, and Backpack 4 — Snake. Season 5 Challenge Pass \u0026 Secret Caches Complete Standard, Special, and Elite Missions to progress through the Season 5 Challenge Pass. Use your earned Challenge Tokens to purchase items in the Exchange including a reskin for the Smoke Grenade, an epic Bathysphere – Killer Whale operator skin, camo crates, and over a dozen Secret Cache of varying rarities. Secret Caches have been updated in Season 5 with a new legendary AK-47 – ICB Rifle replacing the previously available legendary Stun Baton. This new weapon comes alongside new updates to the system with Universal Shards being introduced. These shards can be used for future cache rewards based on the type, so if you’ve already completed the Mythic AK117 you’ll now earn Universal Mythic Shards to use for the next Mythic we release.  Check the in-game Events tab throughout the season for new Missions and rewards.

Store Update: Mythic VMP, NieR Automata New Mythic Weapon Draw: Leader and weaponsmith Rin Yoshida is prepared to do whatever it takes to come out on top.
