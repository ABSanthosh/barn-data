  "text": "Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning and Sinners have both hit meaningful milestones at the global box office, each passing the $350 million mark this weekend.Tom Cruise’s eighth Mission: Impossible film is now up to $353.818 million globally, with positive word of mouth helping fuel a 33% drop from opening weekend. IGN's Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning review returned a 6/10. We said: \"The action thrills, but the soapy tone keeps greatness just out of reach for Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.\"Ryan Coogler’s Sinners, meanwhile, is now up to $350.1 million after seven weekends in theaters. Incredibly, Sinners is the only film in the top 10 highest-grossing of 2025 so far not based on an existing IP. IGN's Sinners review returned a 9/10. We said: \"Ryan Coogler’s first horror movie expertly blends plenty of vampires and music into a compelling story about twin brothers – played by Michael B. Jordan – returning home to their Mississippi hometown in 1932.\"Disney’s live-action Lilo \u0026 Stitch movie, however, overshadows all, with a huge $610.8 million globally after just two weekends. IGN's Lilo \u0026 Stitch review returned an 8/10. We said: \"Lilo \u0026 Stitch is one of the stronger results of Disney’s non-stop remake campaign, taking the emotional core of the original and amplifying it in a stirring manner.\" The question now is, will it end up beating A Minecraft Movie, which is now up to $947.1 million after nine weekends?Elsewhere, Karate Kid: Legends launched with $47 million globally. IGN's Karate Kid: Legends review returned a 6/10. We said: \"Karate Kid: Legends has some fun additions to the usual formula for this series, including Joshua Jackson stealing the show from the series' stalwarts, but doesn’t connect emotionally thanks to some distracting filmmaking techniques.\"The franchise-best Final Destination Bloodlines is up to $229.3 million. And finally, Florence Pugh-fronted MCU film Thunderbolts, which Marvel rebranded as The New Avengers soon after launch, is on $369.6 million globally as it winds down at the box office.Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
