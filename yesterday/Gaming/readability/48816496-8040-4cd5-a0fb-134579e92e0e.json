  "text": "Ryu Ga Gotoku's shiny, mysterious new alt-history action game, Project Century, got a new trailer at Summer Game Fest that contained a lot more information, a lot more questions, and a brand new name: Stranger Than Heaven.Stranger Than Heaven was first revealed at The Game Awards last December as Project Century, but with very little information as to what the game actually was. We know it's being developed by Yakuza creator Ryu Ga Gotoku studio, and features similar-looking action combat to what we've seen elsewhere in the series...albeit dramatically upgraded. For instance, the menus are sleeker, the blood and fighting is more brutal, and the choice to \"Show Mercy\" or \"Show No Mercy\" isn't an option ever offered in Yakuza.Though this new trailer has shed a bit more light on what to expect, it's also raised more questions. For instance, the initial Project Century trailer was set in 1915 in Japan. This one is apparently set in 1943. Why are there two different time periods? Is this a time travel game, or just a game with a really elaborate flashback/time skip? And where in Japan is this? Is this Sotenbori, as suggested by the bridge? Or Kamurocho? Or somewhere new?Then there's the fusion in both trailers of traditional Japanese imagery mixed with classic Americana, like some sort of alternate reality where multiple eras and cultures crashed together. We've seen that dissonance in both trailers for their respective eras, and though it's clear the game takes place in Japan, it's unclear exactly what alt-history is going on here. Fans already have theories, and they're certain to form even more in the wake of this new trailer.Finally, we learned the name of at least one character: Mako Daito. He seems to be the protagonist, but the way things are going, who even knows? He's got some wild blue eyes and suggests in the brief bit of dialogue that there's something strange about him, but it's unclear exactly what. Last year, an odd tease suggested that Snoop Dogg might be in this game too. That's...an interesting cast.You can catch up on everything announced at Summer Game Fest right here, and stick with us for everything coming this weekend from IGN Live.Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
