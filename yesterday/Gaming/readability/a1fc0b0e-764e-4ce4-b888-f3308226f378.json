  "text": "Jurassic World Rebirth stomped into Super Bowl Sunday with a special trailer that showed off even more dinosaur action ahead of its July 2025 premiere.Stars Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali steal this spotlight in this latest footage, but only until a pack of prehistoric beasts runs in to give audiences a taste of what’s in store. While the video shares a lot in common with the trailer Universal premiered last week, it’s still a solid look at the next Jurassic Park movie before it arrives this summer.Jurassic World Rebirth will go in a different direction following the most recent trilogy, which concluded with Jurassic World Dominion in 2022. Sci-fi and monster movie veteran Gareth Edwards is taking over directing duties from Colin Trevorrow, as this latest film in the long-running series seeks to break new ground with fresh faces and a new story. It's unclear how closely Jurassic World Rebirth will be tied to the movies that came before, but we at least know that it is set sometime in the near future.“Five years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion, the planet’s ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs,” a synopsis for Jurassic World Rebirth says. “Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air within that tropical biosphere hold, in their DNA, the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind.”Expect to see more about how the entry fits into the franchise before it releases in theaters July 2, 2025.
