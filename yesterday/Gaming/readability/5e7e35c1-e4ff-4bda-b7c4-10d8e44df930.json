The base model is currently priced at $99.99 (originally $129) and the noise-canceling model is $148.99 (originally $179). This is the first time we've seen the AirPods 4 earbuds drop below $100. In fact, that's a better deal than what we saw during Black Friday, and a great opportunity to pick up a wonderful gift in time for Valentine's Day.Save Over $40 Off the New Apple AirPods 4Apple AirPods 4Apple AirPods 4 with Active Noise CancelationThe Apple AirPods 4 was released on September, 2024 in two variants: both models are mostly identical with the exception of the noise canceling functionality on the more expensive one. The AirPods 4 features several updates over the AirPods 3 which brings it in-line with modern day standards. These improvements include the newer Apple H2 chip (vs H1), Bluetooth 5.3 support (vs Bluetooth 5.0), better IP54 resistance rating which now protects against dust intrustion (vs IPX4), USB Type-C (vs Lightning), and replacement of the skin detect sensor with a more reliable optical in-ear sensor.Should you get the AirPods 4 with ANC over the AirPods Pro?The AirPods 4 with active noise cancelation is mostly similar to the more expensive AirPods Pro 2 with one major difference: the AirPods 4 is an open-ear earbud with non-adjustable tips, whereas the AirPods Pro is an in-ear earbud with adjustable tips. Both ANC models have useful features like Transparency Mode and Conversational Awareness.The AirPods 4 with noise cancelling is currently $20 cheaper than the AirPods Pro 2, which is also on sale for a great price right now. You'll also have to consider what you prioritize more: comfort or performance. In-ear earbuds will provide better noise cancelation and audio quality by nature of its passive isolation, but open-ear earbuds are less intrusive and more comfortable to wear.
