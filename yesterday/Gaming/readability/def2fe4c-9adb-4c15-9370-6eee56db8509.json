FANTASY LIFE i: The Girl Who Steals Time Overview Trailer Watch on YouTube The game launches this week, as detailed on Steam. We haven't covered it before, and I'm not aware that anybody currently employed at the Treehouse has played the previous instalment on 3DS. I do, however, have many fond memories of Level-5's older RPGs - Dark Cloud and Chronicle, Ni no Kuni: Wrath Of The White Witch, and let's not forget Dragon Quest VIII. Still the Dragon Quest to beat, for my onions. Professor Layton? I'm afraid I don't know him. Did they consult with him on Jeanne D'Arc? In any case, Fantasy Life i seems as bright and burgeoning and basically happy to exist as any of those games - so chipper and sparkling that I'm willing to forgo murdering the studio leadership for putting that lowercase \"i\" in the title. The premise is that you're part of an archaeological expedition who discover bits of fossilised dragon on an island. In the process, you also find a portal to the distant past that allows you to unravel the mystery of the island's downfall. Over the course of the game, you will alternate between roaming the monster-addled continents of yore and terraforming the island in the present, adding houses and decorations and terrain fixtures such as rivers. It's an Animal Crossing game with its foot stuck in Dragon Quest Heroes. There is talk of saving the world, but it sounds like that comes a very distant second to choosing the wallpaper. Look out for the game on 21st May. Given the multiple Lives framing, the obvious thing it's missing is an introspective spiral akin to the tawdry soap opera that is The Alters, in which one man clones himself in order to operate a huge rolling spacebase. If I actually had 14 different lives at my disposal, I guarantee you there would be a pecking order with the Cook at the top of it.",
