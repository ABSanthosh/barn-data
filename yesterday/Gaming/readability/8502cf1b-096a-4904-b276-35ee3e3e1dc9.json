  "text": "But Switch 2 owners will need to wait. Image credit: CD Projekt After a series of vehicular teases earlier this week, CD Projekt has finally unveiled Cyberpunk 2077's much-anticipated and mildly delayed 2.3 update, which - among other things - introduces self-driving (but sadly not flying) cars to Night City. Cyberpunk's 2.3 update, developed in collaboration with Virtuous (presumably as most of CD Projekt is now busy on The Witcher 4), is very much focused on traversal. It introduces four new vehicles - the Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru, Rayfield Caliburn \"Mordred\", Yaiba ASM-R250 Muramasa, and Chevillon Legatus 450 Aquila - plus several new Side Jobs to acquire them. All these additions (and, indeed, any of your other vehicles), now support a new \"autonomous driving feature\" CD Projekt is calling AutoDrive. It'll ferry you to your chosen destination without needing to do any of that messy moving-your-hands business, or you can just sit back and enjoy a leisurely cruise around Night City to nowhere in particular if you prefer. And to really make the most of the ensuing sights, there's a cinematic camera for AutoDrive too. Additionally, as of 2.3, Night City residents can - after completing the Don't Lose Your Mind job - summon the services of a self-driving Delamain Cab from the vehicle menu. Also new is the Rayfield's CrystalCoat (and a cracked variant for lower-end vehicles), which you can capture on camera using some of the improvements to Photo Mode. There are 27 new spawnable NPCs, for instance, and outfits for everyone - including V - can be swapped while still in Photo Mode. Then there are new Look-At Camera options, depth of field improvements, new time, weather, and colour balance tabs, plus new stickers, frames, quotes, and overlays. All this - which you can get a taste of in today's 2.3 livestream - arrives alongside a heap of fixes and enhancements, as detailed in CD Projekt's extensive patch notes. But expect the likes of Variable Refresh Rate support for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, plus support for AMD FSR 3.1 Frame Generation, Intel XeSS 2.0, and HDR10+ Gaming on PC. Cyberpunk 2077's 2.3 update launches for most platforms (including Mac) tomorrow, 17th July. Switch 2 owners will need to wait bit, however, as it's hitting the platform \"at a later date\".",
