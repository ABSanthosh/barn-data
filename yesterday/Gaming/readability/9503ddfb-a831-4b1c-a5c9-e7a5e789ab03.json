Ever since Bram Stoker introduced the world to Dracula, vampire fiction has been a top-seller over the decades.

If you've been looking to sink your fangs into the novels, you can grab the entire series at a big discount thanks to Fanatical's new Vampire Hunter D: The Complete Sada Book Bundle. The full 30-book bundle is just $13, which is a massive 93% off the bundle's normal $209.70 value.While the $13 tier is the best value, the bundle is also available in more affordable tiers that include a smaller selection of ebooks, in case you only feel like just dipping a toe into the massive series. The most affordable a two-book pack that includes Vampire Hunter D Volume 1 and Volume 2 for just $1. There's also an eight-book option that adds the next six volumes for just $8. You can check the full lineup of books included in each tier at Fanatical.Each book in the bundle is delivered as DRM-free EPUB ebook format, so you can easily read it on tablet devices, phones, or even your computer.Vampire Hunter D Volume 1Vampire Hunter D has been a consistent best-seller since its first publication in 1983. The series mixes sci-fi and supernatural themes to create a fascinating world set thousands of years in the aftermath of a nuclear war where civilization has been rebuilt by vampires, who rule over the last remaining human survivors until they overthrow their vampiric overlords, plunging the world into chaos once again. Caught in the middle of all this is D, a \"Dhampir\" born from a vampire father and a human mother. Blessed with all the strengths of a vampire and hardly any of their weaknesses, he ekes out a living as a vampire hunter as he travels from town to town. Kikuchi's rich world-building is complimented by illustrator Yoshitaka Amano--best known for his work on Final Fantasy--who has contributed cover art and other illustrations to the Vampire Hunter D series since it began.While this Fanatical deal is the easiest and most affordable way to get into the Vampire Hunter D series, physical editions of the books are also available at Crunchyroll. The most convenient option is the omnibus collections, which include three novels each and cover up to Volume 21 of the series. Omnibus collections of the last nine volumes should launch in the future. However, if you want to complete the collection, you can also pick up physical copies of volumes 22 through 30 individually, too. Vampire Hunter D has also been adapted into a manga series. Unfortunately, most volumes are out of stock online, so you won't be able to grab the full series, but you can still grab a few volumes at Amazon.Vampire Hunter D Novel Omnibus EditionsVampire Hunter D Omnibus Edition: Volume 1 -- $20 ($25)Vampire Hunter D Omnibus Edition: Volume 2 -- $16 ($20)Vampire Hunter D Omnibus Edition: Volume 3 -- $16 ($20)Vampire Hunter D Omnibus Edition: Volume 4 -- $20 ($25)Vampire Hunter D Omnibus Edition: Volume 5 -- $20 ($25)Vampire Hunter D Omnibus Edition: Volume 6 -- $20 ($25)Vampire Hunter D Omnibus Edition: Volume 7 -- $ 20 ($25)A few volumes of the series have been adapted into anime films over the years, starting with Vampire Hunter D in 1985 The first animated film was released in 1985, and it still holds up pretty well for its dark atmosphere, excellent animation, and exciting action scenes. Strangely, this is listed for $100 on Amazon, likely due to low print runs of this steelbook edition. Luckily, the second film, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, is more affordable at $25.60. Animated by Madhouse, Bloodlust earned rave reviews for its incredible production values and it is based on the third novel, Demon Deathchase.Vampire Hunter D Anime FilmsVampire Hunter D -- $100Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust -- $25.60Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.
