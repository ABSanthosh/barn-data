  "description": "There's a very curious sight in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, one that you'll stumble upon once you reach the Himalayas level. It also happens to have a tricky puzzle where the solution isn't as obvious at first glance. Here's our guide on how to complete the Code Table and Captain's Code in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.How to solve the Code Table and Captain's Code in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - Puzzle guideThe Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Captain's Code puzzle is part of the main quest in the Himalayas. It's called A Harsh Climb. As you explore the ship, you'll eventually arrive at an officer's mess hall where everyone has frozen to death. You need to check out a few clues if you want to open the metal door. The Captain's Code clueThe first clue comes from the Captain's Code document. It has the following letters written on it: J-Ö-G-M.There are also two more Code Table documents in this room, but we'll discuss these in a while. Code CipherIf you check the room, you'll see several Code Tables--i.e. disks with letters--on the counter and on the floor. Pick these up and place them in the cipher in the correct order:First slot: The disk with the letter \"J\"Second slot: The disk with the letter \"Ö\" (umlaut)Third slot: The disk with the letter \"G\"Fourth slot: The disk with the letter \"M\" Code Table and Captain's Code solutionOnce all disks are inside the cipher, dial in the letters until \"J-Ö-G-M\" are selected. Curiously enough, nothing happens. However, if you look at the letters below the \"solution,\" you'll see that they spell out \"B-L-U-T.\"Read the Code Table document again. You'll notice \"B-L-U-T\" has a corresponding numerical sequence: 3666. Interact with the panel on the door and input 3-6-6-6. This is the passcode for \"B-L-U-T\" and it will cause the door to get unlocked.That does it for our guide on how to complete the Code Table and Captain's Code puzzle in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. A bit later in the campaign, you have to deal with yet another brain teaser. You can learn more about it in our A Gate of Wits/Mak-Yek guide.You're bound to encounter many secrets, puzzles, and challenges in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. As you continue your adventure, we encourage you to take a look at our Indiana Jones and the Great Circle guides hub.",
