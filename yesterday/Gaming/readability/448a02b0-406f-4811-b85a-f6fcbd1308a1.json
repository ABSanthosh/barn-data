  "description": "There are many reasons why you might need an infinite water source in Minecraft. Maybe you just want the convenience of having water nearby if you've built a base far away from the water. Perhaps you're in a Minecraft server with challenges such as Skyblock, and need to have additional water with limited space. Whatever your need for infinite water, we've got you covered, and even have a solution for infinite water using just one water block.Minecraft water can be found everywhere, but you might not always have it close byHow to get infinite waterThe first guaranteed way to get infinite water in Minecraft is to place two source blocks of water in a 2x2 grid at diagonal corners. This way, you only need four blocks total, as the other two diagonals will convert to source blocks. To add the water, simply craft two buckets and collect it from a nearby river, ocean, or lake.The next, slightly more complicated way, but that only requires one source block, is to dig a T-shaped hole and put one block elevated higher than ground level at the top of the T, resulting in a cross shape. Then, add a water source to the side of the elevated block so that it flows down and fills the dug-out shape.Continue Reading at GameSpot",
