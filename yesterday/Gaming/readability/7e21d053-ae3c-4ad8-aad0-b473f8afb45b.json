  "text": "THPS Fest at the El Rey Theater in Los Angeles celebrates the return of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 by providing a closer look at some of the parks coming to the game on July 11. Read on for a breakdown of the game content, including a look at the featured skateparks being brought into the game by the developers at Iron Galaxy Studios. Iron Galaxy has a long history of working on some of the top IPs in video games. Their meticulous attention to detail and quality creates unforgettable gameplay experienced by players around the world. And now they’re extremely excited to put their stamp on Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4. The Parks Let’s take a look at five parks from the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 Skate Tour and four from the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 4 Skate Tour, including the new Waterpark level. THPS 3 Skate Tour Parks Los Angeles: Hit up sick tricks in the urban landscape of L.A. underneath the Hollywood sign. Watch out for traffic, check out upcoming movies advertised on a vert ramp outside the El Rey theater, and set an earthquake into motion. Foundry: The first skatepark players will drop into as part of the THPS 3 Skate Tour, Foundry is set in an industrial steel mill with molten metal, ramps, grind rails, a secret area, and explosive environmental hazards. Canada: Shred in the mountains of Calgary, Alberta in a snowy outdoor skatepark with ramps, rails, and cabins in an area blending urban and natural elements for diverse trick opportunities. Rio: A vibrant competition level set in Brazil featuring a colorful stadium in downtown Rio with high-scoring lines designed for intense contest runs. Suburbia: Drop into a neighborhood cul-de-sac during Halloween and skate in a construction zone, a haunted house, and a backward swimming pool. As tasty as it may look, try not to get run over by the ice cream truck. THPS 4 Skate Tour Parks College: Skip class and shred the sprawling CCHU campus, stopping in to pop off tricks over the rooftops and across the student plaza while building up huge combos over the stadium rails. San Francisco: Skate outside the Boardwalk View Hotel with views of the San Francisco Bay. Skitch a ride on the trolley, go sightseeing at The Pier, and grind along the overhead walkway in this park blending street skating with vert elements across a large, explorable cityscape. Alcatraz: Visit the gritty island prison and skate its rooftop and the surrounding grounds including a line up to the lighthouse and some sick vert action inside the compound in view of the jail cells. Waterpark: A new park being added to the THPS 4 Skate Tour, Waterpark takes place in the Mojave Desert at a water theme park with rides you can combo on and a skateable lazy river.
