It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Which would you rather have in your makeup collection: a nail polish that never chipped, a foundation that perfectly matched your skin tone, a long-lasting mascara that was easy to remove or a lipstick that never dried out your lips? Nail polish that never chipped! In a heartbeat. 2. How good are you at doing other people’s hair? Not great. Actually, terrible. I realized I really need to work at it when I tried to do Connor’s hair in a french braid for a dance competition, and it looked so wonky it was laughable. 3.

What do you do when you’re sitting on a flight next to a stranger: chat them up or put in your headphones and pretend they’re not there? I’ll do a little polite chat, mostly because I know I’ll have to get up a few times to go to the bathroom, and if I have to climb over them, it’s a little less awkward. 4. What drink do you typically have with a meal? Usually bubbly water or plain water. Sometimes I’ll have an iced tea with lunch, or a very watered down juice (like, 50% of it is water). 5. Pick one: walking or biking? Walking! I’m less likely to crash into someone or something. Hahaha! Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S.
