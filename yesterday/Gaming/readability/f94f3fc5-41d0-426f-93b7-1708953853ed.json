First, we invite you to participate in the Open Beta Test in October to traverse the dynamically-changing locales, examine the diverse ecology, and test your hunting skills on PlayStation 5. We will also be offering special bonuses to those who participate. PlayStation Plus members will have early access to the Open Beta Test from Monday, October 28, 8pm PT / Tuesday October 29 3am GMT, 12pm JST until Wednesday, October 30 at 7:59pm PT / Thursday October 31 2.59am GMT, 11.59am JST.  Those who are not PS Plus members can also participate in the Open Beta Test from Thursday, October 31 8pm PT / Friday November 1 3am GMT, 12pm JST to Sunday, November 3 at 6:59pm PT / Monday, November 4 at 2.59am GMT, 11.59am JST. (Time adjusted for Daylight Savings Time.) Today, we’ll be sharing information about the newly released trailer, as well as special experiences you can enjoy on PlayStation 5. Make sure to watch until the end! New locale – Oilwell Basin The Oilwell Basin is a new locale where the expedition team arrives. As the name implies, the area is brimming with oil wells, which will periodically burst into violent flames. Azuz, the Everforge In the Oilwell Basin, there’s a community that has settled around a large fire forge, where people skilled in the art of forging reside. Please look forward to what stories await you in Azuz. New monsters with unique ecology to discover in the Oilwell Basin The Black Flame A mysterious monster the people from Azuz call the “Black Flame.”  Fanged Beast, Ajarakan With a distinct well-developed shell that covers its back, Ajarakan is active during the Inclemency of the Oilwell Basin, the Firespring, and turns into a sweltering red when it rubs its shell against itself. Brute Wyvern, Rompopolo A monster that inhabits areas with deep oil silts. As you may have noticed, monsters in the Oilwell Basin have adapted to the changing environment with their unique ecological anatomies. What did you think of the new trailer? What will the hunter and the expedition team witness in this area? Expect new findings, deeper mysteries, and a story that will expand into the vast reaches of the land. What you can experience in the Open Beta Test The Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test includes three pieces of content: Character Creation, the Story Trial, and the Doshaguma Hunt. Traverse the Windward Plains to experience a changing ecosystem rife with opportunity. Character Creation Identical to the full release, Character Creation in the Open Beta Test allows players to select their physique and other characteristics (physique does not affect the player’s ability to play the game). Character designs created in the Open Beta Test can be carried over to the full release of the game (game progress will not be carried over). During the Open Beta Test, you can redo Character Creation as many times as you like, so why not take this opportunity to create your favorite Hunter and Palico? Story Trial / Doshaguma Hunt In the Story Trial where you can experience the opening of the game, you will play through the beginning of the story in an uninterrupted and seamless experience to defeat Chatacabra, which also includes a basic tutorial. In the Doshaguma Hunt, take on the titular Doshaguma (alpha) that leads the herd. Both quests can be enjoyed in multiplayer using an SOS Flare to connect with other online players. If players are unable to gather, up to three NPC support hunters will join to assist in the hunt. The quest counter, which can be accessed by talking to Alma, the Handler, allows you to set the number of multiplayer players and other conditions in detail. You can set the number of players to four, or you can call one NPC support hunter and hunt alongside a Palico, etc. Open Beta Test Bonus By participating in the Open Beta Test, players will receive a Pendant and item pack that can be used to decorate their weapons and Seikret in the full release. These bonuses will be available as downloadable content. Enjoy decorating your weapons and Seikret in the full release of the game on February 28. Now let’s review the Open Beta Test schedule*! PlayStation 5 PlayStation Plus members only: Early Access Dates: Monday, October 28, 8:00pm PT / Tuesday October 29 3am GMT, 12pm JST – Wednesday, October 30 at 7:59pm PT / Thursday October 31 2.59am GMT, 11.59am JST.  Pre-downloading is scheduled to begin at 8pm PT on Sunday, October 27, 2024 / 3am GMT, 12pm JST Monday, October 28.  A minimum of 18 GB of free space is required on the PlayStation 5. All PlayStation Network account holders (Those who are not subscribed to PlayStation Plus can also participate.) Thursday, October 31 8pm PT / Friday November 1 3am GMT, 12pm JST – Sunday, November 3 at 6:59pm PT / Monday, November 4 at 2.59am GMT, 11.59am JST.

For more information, please visit the official Monster Hunter Wilds website. Discover a special experience with PS5 with the DualSense Wireless controller:  Haptic feedback Feel every moment in your hands with haptic feedback, which allows you to enjoy precisely expressed vibrations in a variety of scenes, from natural phenomena such as lightning strikes to the roar of a monster. Integrated speaker The controller’s Integrated speaker emits the sounds of the Seikret and other endemic life. You can hear the breath of nearby living creatures. Supports Tempest 3D audio technology With state-of-the-art acoustic technology, you can hear the pulse of nature and life as if you were surrounded by it. Adaptive triggers Another supported feature is adaptive triggers, which change the button resistance depending on the situation. The adaptive resistance allows players to zoom in and out of the map more intuitively and improves usability while exploring vast locales. Motion sensor The accelerometer and gyroscope allow intuitive camera operation. This improves maneuverability during Focus Mode and long-range weapon aim, making it easier to target monsters. Expect an immersive experience that only the PlayStation®5 version of Monster Hunter Wilds can provide. Summary That is all for today!  Although gameplay in the Open Beta Test will be limited, we hope you will be able to experience the seamless immersive experience, the dynamically-changing environment, and realistic monster ecology. Monster Hunter Wilds is now available for pre-order. Make sure to get the Hunter Layered Armor, Guild Knight Set, and Hope Charm. Pre-ordering at PlayStation Store will also include the PlayStation Store exclusive pre-order bonus Monster Hunter Wilds Digital Mini Art Book.
