  "text": "Snug needs you to figure out how to fit a ton of your stuff into a single bag so that nothing gets left behind. I am not sure why I would want to relive the experience of stuffing so many things into a single bag. I typically have to go through this with about 2 hours of sleep while rushing to get to the airport in time for my return flight, so it’s not something I should be looking forward to. That said, having to make a pile of swords, hats, and skateboards play well together so that I can close the bag and reach the next complex packing puzzle is an appealing challenge. Maybe I like packing more than I think. The way the game works is that you’re given some sort of bag and a whole pile of different items you need to squeeze into it. Unfortunately, everything from shirts to hats is rigid as a board, so don’t expect anything to squish down to make your life easier. These items WILL tumble and roll around each other to fit into any open space in the bag, though, so you can’t just rotate everything until it’s the correct shape and then slot it in. It’s more like you’re dropping them down into a pit and then they’ll take up whatever space they can fit in at the bottom. This can become a bit disastrous as the bag fills up, as taking something back out again means everything will collapse into that open space. Snug makes you really think ahead while packing your bag. You’re not just planning a trip (not sure what the boomerang is for, though), but also how to get all of this stuff in your backpack without having to pull out something late in the game and having your whole plan fall apart. Snug is available now (for whatever you wish to pay for it) on itch.io.
