A tradition since 2008, egg hunts hold a special place in Roblox history. Today, the highly anticipated event is making a comeback. The Hatch, our newest event, offers a fresh take on the classic egg hunting adventure, while continuing the tradition of encouraging exploration and discovery across the platform. From July 2-12, players around the world will embark on a quest to find 100 uniquely themed eggs scattered across hundreds of participating experiences—the most ever in Roblox egg hunt history. There’s a whole lot to discover and, of course, plenty of exclusive virtual items to get your hands on, so read on to learn everything you need to know to get started. Explore the Event Hub and Unlock Exclusive Rewards Set within a vibrant coastal wonderland, the event hub is divided into different zones that aren’t only beautiful to explore but also home to portals that transport you to a variety of experiences on Roblox where hidden eggs are waiting to be found. Simply walk over them to pick them up, and an egg will be added to your collection. You can then view which eggs you’ve obtained—and which ones you’ll still need to find—when you return to the hub. Each collectible egg belongs to one of ten elemental themes, like earth, fire, water, and air. And within each theme, you’ll find eggs of varying rarity including common, primal, and mythic. Collect all ten eggs in an elemental set, and you’ll unlock a special “hatchable” egg that rewards you with an exclusive virtual item to wear on your avatar. Work Together to Collect Them All Missing an egg or hoping to snag that elusive mythic? Head back to the hub, where you’ll be able to trade with other players or merge duplicate eggs. Trading is a great way to complete your sets, especially if you’ve got a few extra commons or primals in your collection, and it’s a fun way to team up with friends (or make some new ones) on your journey. And if luck’s on your side, merging duplicate eggs from the same elemental theme could even yield a rarer one. You never know what you’ll get until you try, so don’t be afraid to experiment as you work to complete your collection before the event ends on July 12. Stay Tuned for More Surprises That’s just the start — expect even more special surprises as The Hatch unfolds.
