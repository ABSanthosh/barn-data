  "text": "The lowest price ever on the most powerful iPad ever.Amazon has just dropped prices across the board on various Apple iPad models for Black Friday, including the best deal we've seen on the recently released 2024 Apple iPad Pro. Right now the 11\" model costs $849 (normally $999) and the 13\" model costs $1099 (normally $1299). The new iPad Pro boasts a couple of significant upgrades over its predecessor, including a powerful M4 chip and, for the first time ever, a tandem OLED display.Black Friday iPad Pro DealsiPad Pro (M4) 11\" 256GBiPad Pro (M4) 13\" 256GBIn our 2024 iPad Pro 11\" M4 review, Jacqueline Thomas wrote, \"For creative professionals, the 2024 iPad Pro is the most powerful tablet on the market and is going to shine if your work revolves around a touchscreen. For the rest of us, though, the iPad Pro is simply the most beautiful display you'll find in a tablet, with hardware that's powerful enough to be a top-end device for years to come.\"The 2024 iPad Pro is the best tablet on the market, iOS or otherwise, thanks to the new M4 processor which is both powerful and power efficient. Compared to the previous generation iPad M2, it performs about 20% better. However, the biggest update of the iPad Pro is not the M4 chip, but instead the tandem OLED panel which hadn't previously been seen on an Apple product. Tandem OLED is better than traditional OLED in two ways: (1) it's far brighter and (2) it's less prone to burn-in. If you're wondering why this technology hasn't found its way into TVs, the answer is simply because it's not cost effective at larger sizes. The iPad can get away with it because the 11\" screen is much smaller, but that's also a major reason why the iPad Pro is priced considerably higher than the other iPads in Apple's 2024 lineup.More Apple iPad Deals for Black FridayIf you're looking for other Apple devices, check out our Apple Black Friday hub with deals on AirPods, Watches, and more.Should You Wait Until Black Friday?Black Friday is the best opportunity to score some great deals on electronics, and Apple products are no exception. You might be wondering just how low these prices can go. Although we have no direct feedback from Apple themselves, we have years of our own historical price trends to back up our predictions. At this point, Black Friday is close enough that there's certainly no harm waiting. We might see as much as a $50 or even $100 price drop on the more expensive models like the iPad Air or iPad Pro. The iPad and iPad Mini might drop another $20 at most if retailers are feeling generous. If Amazon isn't your preferred vendor (or if it runs out of stock), I expect these deals to be available at Best Buy and Walmart as well. The Apple Store will also host its own Black Friday Sale, although these deals usually aren't nearly as good.Looking for more iPad resources?If you're not sure which iPad is best for you, we have an iPad guide which details which iPad is ideal for which use case. If you intend want to get an iPad for schoolwork, we have an iPad guide for students as well. If you're looking for options outside of iOS, check out the best Android tablets of 2024.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
