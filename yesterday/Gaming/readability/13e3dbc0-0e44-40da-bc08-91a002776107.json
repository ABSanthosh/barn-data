  "text": "The least expensive adjustable dumbbells for Black Friday.Bowflex isn't the only option when it comes to adjustable dumbbell sets. FitRX is another popular brand at a much, much lower price point. As part of the Walmart Black Friday deals, you can pick up a pair of FitRx Adjustable Dumbbells for only $139. A comparable set of Bowflex 551 adjustable dumbbells costs three times more. Walmart even offers free shipping, which is great considering the fact that this package will weigh in at well over 100 pounds.Pair of FitRX Adjustable Dumbbells (52.5lbs Each)FitRx 52.5lb Adjustable Dumbbells (Pair)The low price of $139 gets you a pair of FitRx adjustable dumbbells, or $69.50 apiece. Each dumbbell is adjustable from 5 pounds all the way to 50 pounds. The weight can be adjusted across 15 increments (5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, 20, 22.5, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, and 52.5lbs) with just a turn of the dial. The advantage of an adjustable dumbbell is that the plates are all neatly contained in a small tray, which means this set will take up far less floor space than an entire rack of individual dumbbells. A stand isn't included but honestly any sturdy stand or table will do. I haven't personally tried out this exact brand of dumbbells, but I can tell you that although they are cleverly engineered, adjustable dumbbells feature a relatively simple design with few moving parts (and no electronics and software) so they are easy to replicate. The FitRx dumbbells have plenty of positive reviews on Walmart, with over 2,700 users rating it an average of 4.4 out of 5 stars. The FitRx brand is exclusively sold at Walmart. so you won't find this deal elsewhere.Save $250 Off the CAROL Stationery Exercise BikeFree weights are a great choice for anyone who wants to work out at home but is limited on space. A pair of dumbbells is all the equipment you need to get access to a wide range of exercises that can target just about every muscle in your upper and lower body. Supplement your free weight exercises with cardio and other workouts that use your own body weight as resistance (like pushups, burpees, or squats) and you may never need to purchase more equipment.When Is Black Friday 2024?The actual date of Black Friday in 2024 falls on November 29 this year, but the deals season will begin a lot sooner than that. Leading up to the big event, retailers will begin to open deals online. This usually starts in the last week of October, just before Halloween. Each week leading up to the event will slowly roll out more deals, which ultimately leads to massive discounts on Black Friday. Retailers will not reveal their biggest Black Friday deals until the big day, but most general deals will be available well in advance.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
