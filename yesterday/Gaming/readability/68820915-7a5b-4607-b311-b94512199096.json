Steam Spring Sale 2025 Steam Store It is time for one of the Steam Sales I don’t really get all that worked up for, the Spring Sale. Steam Spring Sale 2025 That is, in part, because it isn’t even effing spring yet and even here in California it is rainy and cold.  I get it, Valve is up in Washington where it is always rainy, but don’t think you can fool us about when spring starts! Still, it is a sale and stuff has been marked down.  They even have the big 90% markdown section which includes, among a few other titles, Civilization VI for just $6.00.  That is a hell of a deal.  You can even get it and ALL of its DLC a low combo price. Of course, Civilization VII is still full price, and the last time I checked Steam Charts more people were playing the previous title than the new one… so is it a good idea to be pulling people to the older title?  We’ll get to that. BlizzCon is BACK… in 2026 Blizzard News Post Blizzard is getting out the news a bit early this time.  There have been years when they haven’t announced BlizzCon for the current year this early.  But I guess they got the green light from Phil to go ahead and start planning.  They even have a short trailer. It is going to return on September 12 and 13 of 2026, so you have 18 months to get ready… and so do they.  But they have the BlizzCon site updated and ready. WoW Housing Interior Design Preview Blizz Dev Post The march towards housing in World of Warcraft continues, though I guess it is probably going to be a toss-up as to whether it or the next BlizzCon will arrive first.  Yes, I am a pessimist on this, but Blizz has a history of taking their time. But the descriptions and videos in that post give me a good feeling for their direction at least.  We shall see how it ends up, but for the moment it looks to be shaping up. Niantic Confirmed Selling Pokemon Go to the Saudis Game Developer Article I posted a while back about Niantic ditching their games, including Pokemon Go, which is the only game that made the company relevant, so they can take all the data they harvested from players and feed it into an AI, likely to help some military target civilians or some such. Pokemon Gone! Apparently the sale wasn’t fully confirmed when I wrote about it, but it is now and the post I linked over at Game Developer is full of so many canned quotes from the press release praising Scopely, the new owners, and Niantic for its farsighted wisdom that I started feeling uncomfortable reading it.  Anybody engaging in that much mutual masturbation in public clearly has no shame. One aspect of this I missed the first time around was that Scopely was itself bought out by Savvy Games Group which is owned by the Saudi government through its sovereign wealth fund.  When they aren’t murdering journalists in their embassy or ruining professional golf they have to spend their oil money on something.  Savvy also put a bunch of money into Embracer, which we saw went to Lars Wingefors head and made him think he must be a business genius and not a patsy used as a front to disperse oil revenues overseas.  They couldn’t have chosen a better sucker. Oh, and Saudi Arabia gets all your location data too, and they definitely bomb civilians. Civilization VII Updates Ars Technica Article Civilization VII has been out for a month now and, as I pointed out above, it is still in second place behind Civ VI on Steam these days and its positive reviews have dropped to 49% of the total, but Firaxis says they are working on it. The team is playing the “listening to users” card to show they are being responsive to the community, but a lot of what was wrong early on seemed fairly obvious and rather a poor idea to go live with.  But when you set a date you set a date I guess. Firaxis has also denied that they deliberately short changed the Windows version of the game to focus on console support, especially for the Steam Deck, support for which is becoming more important as time passes.  I’m still waiting until things settle down before I give it a try. Straining Credulity Articles and Polygon and Massively OP I wrote a bit about Jeff and Annie Delisi Strain last year when they folded up operations at Crop Circle Games because an employee was alleged to have spoke to the press, which led to a bizarre public tirade about a reporter at Kotaku. Well, now the Strains are saying somebody at NCsoft actually said something to other investors that made them shut the company down and are suing NCsoft and the remaining board member at their company for $900 million for what essentially adds up to “reasons.”",
