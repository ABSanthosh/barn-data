Image credit: Microsoft / Eurogamer Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's PS5 release date will reportedly be announced tomorrow, 24th March. That's according to ultra-reliable leaker billbil-kun, who not only shared the proposed announcement date but also revealed the cover art, too. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's \"spring\" arrival on PS5 has been known for a good few months now, and earlier this month, Billbil-kun said The Great Circle will launch on Sony consoles on 17th April.

It seems the premium edition will be available as both a digital and physical version. Billbil-kun has also asserted that a game disc will be included in the physical version of the premium edition, although it seems \"an internet connection will still be required to download the game and its content\". Challenged on their sources, Billbil said the information comes via \"metadata\". \"Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones,\" Eurogamer's Katharine Castle wrote in her five-star review of The Great Circle last year, \"[this] is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames\".
