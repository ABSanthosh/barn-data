  "text": "One of the things you have to accept in an MMORPG is that you cannot really change the outcome of the story in any significant way.  Things will end up the way they were intended to, and all the more so in Lord of the Rings Online, where Turbine/SSG are pretty much contractually obligated to not mess with the works of Dr. Tolkien. So if you’ve read the books… or, to a lesser extent, have seen the films… you likely have a pretty good idea how things have to work out. Having arrived in Minas Tirith, as noted in my previous post about the journey, I was not at all committed to doing “all the things.”  As with the tale so far, I was primarily concerned with my main goal along with some secondary goals along the way.  The main goal remains to advance the story so as to step foot in Mordor. The secondary goals are generally to keep myself leveling up with the story, to keep my gear upgraded so as not to hinder progress, and to work on just enough faction status to help make travel easy.  Playing a hunter, that means getting as many of the fast travel skills as possible, which are often obtained when one becomes an acquaintance with the local faction. Gondor is a little more stringent on that front, requiring one to be a friend of the faction before handing out travel skills.  So while I was already past level for stuff… content between the Paths of the Dead and the siege of Minas Tirith caps out at 100 and I was already 103… I still had some faction to earn, which sent me out into the Pelennor to do what I mostly do… murder for hire, with some property destruction along the way. I hooked up with Ingold, Captain of the Out Wall, who was hanging out at the north gate of said Out Wall, which conveniently has a stable master, to get some quests to help me up my rep with the Defenders of Minas Tirith, the in-group in the area. Ingold had a bit for me to so, but not as much as I had hoped.  I had to ride on down to the south gate, which does not have a stable master, to get a few more quests.  But I also just hunted on my own in among the camps of the attackers, slaying Easterlings, Southrons, Uruk-Hai, Morgul Scouts, and a surprising number of buzzing swarms of insects, the latter indicating a need for some sort of mosquito abatement program in the post-war version of the Pelennor. This got me some xp and advanced some deeds, but mostly got me drops for daily tasks which I could turn in for the faction boosts.  Until I got the fast travel I was having to find connecting flights to get from the homestead I finally picked up… there is another tale in that, but my main use is for the unified task boards… back to Minas Tirith.  As it turns out, the Twenty-First Hall in Moria has a direct route to both the homestead and Minas Tirith. Anyway, I did that during the week, keeping to my goal of using up my blue bar and doing all my available task turn-ins daily, and managed to finally get into the friend zone with Minas Tirith at about the point I was closing in on level 105. Of course, hitting friends also unlocks a bunch of daily quests at both gates out in the Pelennor… just as soon as I didn’t really need them.  I did a few anyway, just to fill my bags with task material. Then it was back through the front gate of the city to the faction vendor where I got the hunter travel skills for Minas Tirith, which are available as both before and after the siege, a warning that I was going to be dealing with multiple versions of the place if I wasn’t careful. At that point I was ready to advance the story.  Let’s get to the siege and Grond knocking on the front door and all that.  But it looks like I needed to advance the epic quest line to unlock that, which meant a series of tasks that sent me running around town. First I had to get Pippin some lunch and listed to his problems.  Then I had to go check on some storage facilities.  Then there was a whole side venture with Gandalf into the archives where we went though a whole story about Gothmog, who took Osgiliath, being Mordirith (who figured heavily back in scene 22 in Angmar) rebodied/reborn/recycled, maybe possibly actually being Earnur, the King of Gondor who rode into Minas Morgul on a dare and was never seen again. Gandalf doing his own research The worry here being that he has a better claim to the throne of Gondor than Aragorn and somehow might be… I don’t know, accepted as king… and there is a whole black tree/dead tree movement in the city or some such and I had to go around and kill them all to make sure this never became an issue.  Feels a little extreme, like the people were going to accept him as king… but then I looked at who we elected president and I figured Gandalf was right, best to be safe because people as a group are dumb. The evidence for this theory is that Tolkien never said what became of Earnur… so it could have happened that way!  This was Turbine pushing the envelop of what the appendix covers. I also had to have an interview with Denethor who, in the books at least, treated everybody as an half-wit and barely deigned to acknowledge even Gandalf might know anything useful.  But me… me he wanted to pal around with. Like I am somebody special… do I look like his dead son or something? He was so keen to share that he took me to the top of the tower to gaze into his palantir. My ball, let me show it to you The palantir apparently comes with a screen sharing option or some such because we were able to look into the ball together and have him guide me through all the things that he had seen that set him in despair. Frodo in Mordor… but no Sam visible… So we got to see that Rohan won’t arrive before the siege starts, that Frodo had been snatched in Mordor, and that his hemorrhoids would not shrink without surgery.  It was a grim foretelling… though why he was telling it all to me seems pretty odd.  But I guess we had to get that part of the story finished before I got sucked into the in-between state between the two versions of the city.  I had to go through the siege… which was quite annoying. Minas Tirith besieged I mean, sure, the siege looks pretty cool.  Bu Gandalf and a few others have tasks for me during the siege, none of which seemed especially well suited to a heavily armed mysterious stranger with a history of violence. I was, for a start, issued a bucket that I had to run around with, up and down the various tiers of the city, putting out specific fires, often as people just stood there and watched them burn, only to cheer me when I showed up to splash a couple liters of water on the minor conflagration.  They could have just smothered the damn thing by half heartedly kicking debris at it. Maybe Forlong could have lifted a finger and saved me a trip across the city And, I had to do that without the stable masters, because while they will stick to their post in almost any danger, they draw the line at Nazgul it seems. I also had to run around and collect dropped weapons and buck up terrified soldiers, four out of five of whom were not having it, then when I gathered some I had to tell them some stories of my adventures to get them back into the mood to resist Mordor. I am pretty sure that is just a metaphor you see there Then I had to run back up to the top and report in, where I found that the model of the city wasn’t a mere idealized representation, but some sort of magical model that changed as the city changed… of something like that. Seriously, how does that even work?  Is it another function of the palantir? But that wasn’t even the annoying bit.  Eventually I ran into Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth who said that, in order to complete the siege, I had to play through the Siege of Minas Tirith epic battle.  There was no optional story mode version to play through, as there had been back at Helm’s Deep. Of course, since I had barely done a single epic battle, I hadn’t earned any talent points to up my skills, plus the whole thing doesn’t guide you very well, so I spent a bunch of time either trying to figure out what to do or getting in over my head because I clearly did the wrong thing. This was neither fun nor epic Eventually I was defeated and, on reviving, I figured I should just fast travel to after the siege to see what happened. And, sure enough, I got there and Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth was standing there near the broken front gates with a quest turn in ready.  He spoke of the successful defense and my part in it and how we were not done yet.  The place was kind of a mess. Things looking pretty beat up in the first ring So I had kind of skipped past pretty much the entirety of the siege, unless you count dousing a few fires in the city and waiting for an NPC to crank a winch for 10 minutes to open up a gate to let Aragron, his followers, and his army of the dead into the battle, after which I gave the whole thing a miss. But that was fine.  Once more, I am not here to make friends… I mean, I’m not here to complete every quest.  I am here to get to Mordor.   And now that the siege was over and I had hit level 106… there were no stable masters in the between state of the siege, but that forge master was there, so he upgraded my legendary items.  Also, there was the Belfalas real estate lady hawking luxury estates.  Somehow she was standing there in every version of the city, siege or no. Now more than ever, Belfalas housing is there for you! I was ready to join whatever band was set to head towards Mount Doom, the Black Gate, and locations beyond.  Of course, following in the tradition of my experience with the city so far, Prince Imrahil put me to work on a task worthy of my talents. Once again on the fire brigade I keep this up and I’ll get my own personalized bucket soon.",
