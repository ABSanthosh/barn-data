  "text": "Sunrise on the Reaping is out on March 18.There are very few young adult novels as successful as the Hunger Games books. Suzanne Collins released the first book in 2008 and has since released three more books and a total of five movies. And it doesn't stop there as just last year Collins announced yet another book in the series with a movie already in the works.The next Hunger games book, titled Sunrise on the Reaping, is set to come out on March 18, 2025. Despite only being a preorder, the hardcover edition has already jumped into the top five on Amazon's best-sellers list of books. It has officially surpassed Onyx Storm on this list, which had a wildly successful debut last month and topped last year's Amazon charts ahead of its release.The hardcover edition of Sunrise on the Reaping is currently receiving a 30% discount on Amazon, dropping the price under $20. You can find a similar discount on the Kindle version of the book.Sunrise on the Reaping Preorder DealSunrise on the Reaping (A Hunger Games Novel)The new Hunger Games novel is the fifth book in the series, but it will be taking place in an entirely different place on the timeline. Sunrise on the Reaping is set about 40 years after the events of The Ballad of Songbird and Snakes and 24 years before we reach Katniss' story in the original Hunger Games novel. The story will be taking place during the Second Quarter Quell, which was won by Haymitch Abernathy. If you've read the original novels, you'll know that Haymitch was the mentor for District 12 and portrayed by Woody Harrelson in the films.If you'd prefer to wait for the film adaptation of this novel, it already has a release date of November 20, 2026.See more Hunger Games books:What Is Amazon's Preorder Price Guarantee?If you've never actually preordered anything from Amazon before, it's worth noting that if you purchase this book, it includes Amazon's preorder price guarantee. According to Amazon's own help page, this means that if the price decreases between now and when the item ships, you'll pay the lowest price. So in this case, if there ends up being an even bigger discount than the one we're seeing right now, that's what you'll pay. Though, it is unlikely that the preorder price will drop much lower than it is right now with the 30% discount.Originally posted: Feb 21, 2025 11:45 pmIn This Article",
