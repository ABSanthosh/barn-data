For more information on each product and why they are worth your consideration, read through below.Final Fantasy XVI (PS5)Final Fantasy XVI (PS5)Final Fantasy XVI is down to $24.97. This is way lower than the previous best price of $39.99 and I can pretty much guarantee you that it won't drop any further for Black Friday. This is an epic game in every sense of the word. In our 9/10 Final Fantasy XVI review, Mitchell Saltzman wrote that \"Featuring fast, reflex driven, action heavy combat, Final Fantasy 16 is certainly a departure from what fans may expect out of a Final Fantasy game, but its excellent story, characters, and world building are right up there with the best the series has to offer, and the innovative Active Time Lore feature should set a new standard for how lengthy, story-heavy games keep players invested in its world.\"Amazon Buy One Get One 50% Off Select Video GamesAmazon Buy One Get One 50% Off Select Video GamesAmazon just kicked off a buy one get one free sale on select video games. The list includes two recently released and highly rated video games: Metaphor Refantazio (rated 9/10 at IGN) and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 (rated 8/10 at IGN). Both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S editions are eligible for this promotion.3 Months of Hulu + Live TV, Disney+, ESPN+ BundleHulu is offering its Hulu + Live TV service bundled with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $59.99 for 3 months. It's normally $82.99, so you're saving nearly 30% off. Note that all three included packages are ad-supported. This bundle gives you access to the entire Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+ streaming libraries, no-hassle setup, no hidden fees, and unlimited DVR. Live TV gives you access to 95+ TV channels including ABC and ESPN.Note that Deadpool and Wolverine will be available for streaming on Disney+ starting November 12.Anker Prime 27,650mAh 250W USB Power BankAnker Prime 27,650mAh 250W USB Power BankWoot! (owned by Amazon) has just dropped the price on its highest capacity power bank: The Anker Prime 27,650mAh 250W Power Bank is down to $99.99 (originally $180). Amazon Prime members get free shipping, otherwise it's an extra $6. This is the best price we've seen by a fair amount; the previous historic low was $120 during Prime Day. It also happens to be the best Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally X charger you can get. Very few power banks can match its 250W output.Apple iPad 9th Gen 10.2\" 64GBApple iPad 9th Gen 10.2\" 64GBThis super popular deal is back ahead of Black Friday. Amazon is currently offering a brand new 9th gen (2021) Apple iPad 10.2\" Wi-Fi 64GB tablet for only $199.99. That's 40% off the $329 list price and the lowest price we've seen. This is the most affordable iPad model you can get brand new with warranty. Right now you would have to pay an extra $100 to upgrade to the newest 10th gen Apple iPad, whichi may not be worth it for most people.Save 50% Off Walmart+ (Includes Paramount+ Essential)Save 50% Off Walmart+ (Includes Paramount+ Essential)Walmart is slashing the price of its Walmart+ membership by 50%, which means you're paying only $49 instead of $98. This promotional price is available to anyone who isn't a current annual Walmart+ member. That means new, expired, trial, and monthly members are all eligible. This promotion only comes around a few times a year and you absolutely do not want to miss out. Walmart+ gives you a whole host of benefits that extends beyond free expedited shipping, including streaming access to Paramount+, early access to Black Friday deals, and more. This sale runs through Black Friday and ends on December 2 (Cyber Monday), but there's plenty of great reasons why you should get it sooner than later.Save $250 Off the CAROL Stationery Exercise BikeBose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling HeadphonesBose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling HeadphonesThe QuietComfort is essentially a re-name of the QuietComfort 45 with some new color options. That's not a bad thing. These are the best noise cancelling headphones you can find right now for under $200. Aside from Bose's excellent sound and noise cancelling performance, the QuietComfort features excellent ergonomics, up to 24 hours of battery life, a fast charging USB Type-C port (3 hours of juice after 15 minutes of charge), and an \"Aware Mode\" function that allows you to hear your surroundings.Audible Premium PlusNon-Current Subscribers OnlyAudible Premium PlusOne of the best Audible deals for Black Friday and the upcoming holiday season has started early at Amazon. From now until December 31, non-current Audible subscribers are eligible for three months of Audible Premium Plus for $0.99 per month. Premium Plus is Audible's best plan and three months would normally cost you about $44.95. You also get a free audiobook of your choice each month that you get to keep indefinitely.Note: The fine print says that anyone who does not have a current Audible subscription is eligible. Normally with trials like these, Amazon explicitly states \"current and past\" subscribers aren't eligible. I'm not sure if that means previous Audible members who have let their subscriptions lapse are allowed to get in on this deal. If you're one of those people, there's an easy way to check: After you log into your account, if you see the $0.99 promo banner right on Amazon's Audible page then you're eligible and if you don't then you're not.25% Off + Free Shipping on All Socks at BombasWingspan Board GameApply 25% off Target Circle CouponWingspan Board GameWe haven't seen a deal on Wingspan at all in 2024 until now. Target has it for $39.74 when you apply the 25% off Target Circle coupon. This Stonemeier game released in 2019, but we still consider it one of the best board games to play in 2024. Wingspan is a deceptively simple and yet endlessly replayable game, and you'll find yourself developing and honing new strategies with every subsequent playthough. In our IGN 8/10 rated Wingspan review, Matt Thrower writes, \"As you might have gathered, Wingspan is a moderately complex game, certainly moreso than most of its peers who’ve made the jump into wider popularity. But it’s clear from the success of the game that its delightful components and appealing theme are more than enough to get many players to take the plunge. And, once there, they’re won over by the absorbing and addictive strategies on offer.\"Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
