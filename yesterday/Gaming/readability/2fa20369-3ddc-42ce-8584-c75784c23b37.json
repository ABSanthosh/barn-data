If you're on the hunt for the best gifts for readers, however, it's a little easier. People who love books love book gifts, plain and simple.Personally, I'm what you may consider a binge reader. I usually go through about three to five books per month, and if I find a new series I really like, that number will shoot up quickly. All of this reading means I can never have too many books and book accessories and I have a decent idea of what gifts readers will love. Below, I've outlined some of the most enticing book gift ideas I've found for 2024, including but not limited to the classic Kindle, bookends, book lights, and of course, books.TL;DR - The Best Gifts for Readers in 2024Collectible Illustrated EditionsLord of the Rings: Illustrated EditionHarry Potter: The Illustrated Collection (Books 1-3)What do you get for someone who has already seeminly read everything? My recommendation would be an awesome collectible version of a series they already love. There are quite a few illustrated editons available to choose from. My top choice would be the LoTR books because you can get the Deluxe Illustrated Edition that includes illustrations from Tolkien himself. The Harry Potter books would be my second top pick as I have gifted those to various people over the years. You can browse some other popular choices below, and also see our top Lord of the Rings gift ideas and Harry Potter gifts.Popular Book Box SetsWith so many books available digitally these days, a lot of folks don't actually own physical editions of their favorite series. Book sets are a great gift for that reason, and many of these box sets also include some sort of art on the binding that make them excellent decor items. My top pick here would be the Game of Thrones books. They are one of the most popular fantasy series available despite everyone still waiting on the final book, Winds of Winter. A Good E-ReaderKindle (16 GB)Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB)Kindle Kids (16 GB)Amazon Scribe (32GB)Amazon New Amazon Kindle Scribe (32GB) - TungstenAs someone who reads a lot, I've found that an e-reader is absolutely essential. Not only is it difficult to carry a large stack of physical books everywhere you go, the convenience of being able to download new titles as soon as you finish reading one.The e-reader I'd personally recommend is the standard Amazon Kindle thanks to the paper-like screen and built-in adjustable backlight. There are other tablets that are great for reading as well if you are looking to gift a device that can do more than just display words.A Cool Set of BookendsGeode BookendsWalnut BookendsPortal BookendsA large collection of physical books is a wonderful addition to any home, but a cool set of book ends can really bring it all together (literally). There are a ton of book ends available, but the set I would personally recommend is this pair of Agate bookends. My grandfather used to collect stones like this and hand cut them to bookend his own book collection, so I own a few of these. Because it's a decor item, however, there are a lot of different style choices available and we've added some additional picks below.Must-Have Book AccessoriesLooking for more gift ideas? We've gathered a ton of cool book acessories below. This includes things like bookmarks, reading lights, and other things that can improve the reading experience.For more holiday shopping, see our other gift guides fellow bookworms might love:Our favorite D\u0026D giftsStar Wars giftsMarvel giftsBest gift cardsBest gifts under $50Best tech giftsJacob Kienlen is a Senior SEO Strategist and Writer for IGN.
