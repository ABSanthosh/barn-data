Iâ€™m chugging a huge bottle of cold water as I type this. Oh, and you know what? I donâ€™t know how I made it through the â€˜80s and â€˜90s because I barely drank any water back then, LOL! I donâ€™t remember feeling awful at the time, but I guess that was due to the magic of being young. Now if I donâ€™t drink massive amounts of water throughout the day I feel it in my body, my brain, my skin, sheesh, even my eyes feel dry if I donâ€™t have enough water, haha!
