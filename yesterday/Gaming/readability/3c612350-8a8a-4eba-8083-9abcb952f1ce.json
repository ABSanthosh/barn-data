The movie will expand the live-action Sonic universe by introducing the Blue Blur's fan-favorite rival, Shadow the Hedgehog. Keanu Reeves is voicing this new incarnation of Shadow, while Ben Schwartz and Jim Carrey return as Sonic and Dr. Eggman, respectively.While fans have to wait a few more weeks to see Sonic, Shadow, and Dr. Eggman finally clash on the big screen, you can make the wait for Sonic the Hedgehog 3 a little easier by catching up on the many other Sonic movies and TV series that are available on Blu-ray.To help you track them down, we've rounded up all the Sonic movies and TV series Blu-rays into this buying guide. You'll find links to the previous Sonic movies, the Knuckles series, and the numerous Sonic TV shows check out. That includes classic 90s series like The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic Underground, as well as newer shows like the Sonic X anime series or Sonic Prime. We've also thrown in a selection of Sonic comic collections and video games to round things out, including the most recent entry in the series, Sonic X Shadow Generations. Sonic the HedgehogSeveral years after it was first released, it's still amazing to think how close the world came to an Ugly Sonic movie. Fortunately, a months-long delay led to a welcome redesign of the Blue Blur, and the film was also a treat for anyone who watched it. A regular Blu-ray can be yours for $10, but if you're looking to splurge, the $33 4K version includes some great extras, like a snazzy steelbook case, a mini-comic, and several poster cards.Sonic the Hedgehog - Bonus Stage Steelbook Edition (4K) -- $33Sonic the Hedgehog -- $10 Sonic the Hedgehog 2The first Sonic sequel brought fan-favorite characters like Tails and Knuckles into the fold and made the Chaos Emeralds a central part of the plot.

Similar to the 1993 Sonic animated series, the show once again sees Sonic meet up with resistance groups in an effort to overthrow Dr. Robotnik and end his reign of terror, but this series was a bit more light-hearted in comparison.Sonic Underground: The Complete Series (DVD) -- $15 ($25) Sonic BoomThis CG-animated series is great for younger members of the family. The Sonic Boom series focused on Sonic, Tails, Amy, Knuckles, and Sticks as they teamed up to protect their home village on Seaside Island from attacks by Dr. Eggman and his robot minions.

Beautifully illustrated and packing a narrative punch, these are easy to dive into thanks to the various IDW Collections out there.We've also included the Encyclo-Speedia on this list, a mus-have for Sonic historians looking to explore the games over several decades.

Modern Sonic games typically fall into one of two camps, with one group focusing on recreating the retro golden years of the franchise and the other attempting to tread new ground with ambitious 3D adventures.For fans of looking for a more classic experience, Sonic Origins Plus and Sonic Mania are likely your best bet, while those interested in something new should give Sonic Frontiers a try, which takes the series in a new open-world direction. There's also the recently released Sonic X Shadow Generations, which includes two playable campaigns. One is a remaster of the original Sonic Generations campaign and the other is an all-new storyline starring Shadow the Hedgehog that run parallel to the events of Generations.Sonic Origins Plus -- $25 ($40)Sonic Mania -- $20Sonic Frontiers -- $20 ($40)Sonic X Shadow Generations -- $50Sonic Forces -- $20",
