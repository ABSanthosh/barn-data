He instead revealed the cover for the next illustrated edition from the Song of Ice and Fire: A Feast for Crows. This is the fourth book in the series to get a special illustrated edition, and it will feature artwork from Jeffrey R. McDonald.A Feast for Crows: The Illustrated edition is set to release on November 4, 2025. You can preorder the new special edition book from Amazon, Barnes \u0026 Noble, Target, and pretty much any of the best places to buy books online.A Feast for Crows: The Illustrated Edition PreorderA Feast for Crows: The Illustrated EditionThis update is great news for anyone who has already been collecting the illustrated editions. A Storm of Swords received this treatment all the way back in November 2020, so it will have been five years since the last illustrated edition came out.In addition to the illustrations, the new edition of A Feast of Crows will feature a forward from Joe Abercrombie. Martin's blog stated that they will be sharing some of the interior illustrations later this spring ahead of the book's release. If you're a fan of the Game of Thrones books and are looking to start collecting, the first three illustrated entries in A Song of Ice and Fire are already available.More Game of Thrones Books:What About The Winds of Winter?For fans still waiting on a release date for The Winds of Winter, unfortunately they may still be waiting quite a while. The last update we got from Martin about the next book in the series was in an interview back in December 2024 where he acknowledged that he may never finish The Winds of Winter in his lifetime. This comes after his update back in November 2023 when he confirmed he's already written 1,100 pages of the book.While this lack of an update is disappointing for those who have already waited almost 14 years for the next Game of Thrones book, there is still some hope that the series will get completed by somebody. With the fourth illustrated edition now on its way, it is definitely looking like the first five special editions will be completed before Winds is finished, however.Looking for more special edition books? Theres a new illustrated interactive Harry Potter book available for preorder and the new Hunger Games illustrated edition was just announced as well.Originally posted: Feb 28, 2025 12:38 am",
