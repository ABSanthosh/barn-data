  "text": "Seafrog is a colorful skateboarding action game where you are exploring ships and discovering strange monsters as you’re heading home. It is a 2.5D platformer where you can ride a skateboard around giant boats, grinding on pipes and grabbing onto leaky spouts. Everything about this game screams joy and fun. The skateboarding on the wrench, the frog with headphones, the colorful strange monsters that are within these ships; it’s all a delight to see. You even get to watch little cutscenes that give more context to the monsters and moments within the game. This game takes you onto some old, abandoned, leaky boats filled with characters who have taken over. You’ll run into all sorts of oddballs like man-eating chickens, frog fairies, and giant octopuses. There are actually a lot of dangers within these places but you have been left with no choice as you and your trusty USB companion have been lost at sea. After plugging in the USB, you’ll be given a map, some spaces for mods, and a game plan to launch yourself from a cannon to get back to some island. In order to use the cannon, you need to find goal seashells and plug them into the generator. Sometimes, you can even find mods that add more lives or change how your skateboarding works, though you can only hold a limited amount at once. I found that the way you glide about on your skateboard does take some getting use to, but once you have mastered the controls, everything feels like so much fun to do and you’ll want to keep going back to the levels. You can sort of decide where you want to go next, as these ships have a surprising amount of rooms – some even containing various challenges. Many of these boats also need leaks fixed or keys in order to unlock different areas, giving you more to explore. Seafrog is available now on Steam.
