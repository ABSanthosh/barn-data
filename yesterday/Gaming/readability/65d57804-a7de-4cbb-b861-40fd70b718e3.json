Cavill has signed on to star in the upcoming live-action adaptation of Voltron from Amazon MGM Studios.According to The Hollywood Reporter, Cavill is only the second member of the Voltron cast to be announced. Daniel Quinn-Toye, a relative unknown, was also cast in a leading role after he won accolades for performing as Tom Holland's understudy in a Romeo \u0026 Juliet production in London's West End.No details about Cavill's role were disclosed, but if the film is staying close to the source material then he's likely playing Keith Kogane, the leader of a group of five space explorers who were sent by the Galaxy Alliance to the planet Arus. After their arrival, the team discovers the lost robot lions that let them combine and form Voltron in order to oppose King Zarkon and his Drule empire. Voltron is the only force in the universe that can stand up to Zarkon's monstrous robeasts and his plans to conquer Arus.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Because of Voltron's popularity in America, new episodes were created with the Lion Force Voltron and there was an eventual crossover special with both versions of Voltron.In 2016, DreamWorks Animation produced a reboot animated series, Voltron: Legendary Defender, which had a 78 episode run on Netflix.
