  "text": "Hello Xbox fans! We’re delighted to announce that our new game, Overthrown, will launch into Xbox Game Preview on Xbox Series X|S and PC on December 10, and will be available with Game Pass. For those of you who might be seeing our game for the very first time, Overthrown is a city builder with more than just one twist – our game is all about chaos, and just to throw something a bit unusual into the mix, we allow you to play like an anime character with superhero abilities, and with up to 5 friends. That said, you’ll still have to build a city, defend it from mutants and bandits, and manage it.  Today, I’m sharing some insights to maximize your co-op experience. Now, just to set the scene, a bit of background. Thanks to an ancient soul-stealing crown that possesses magical abilities, you have the power to lift anything that’s in front of you. Big trees – not a problem. Monster nests – even easier. Lifting a whole sawmill building so instead of feeding individual trees you can just run through the forest and absorb trees along the way? Why not? Your strength knows no bounds! You also possess supersonic  speed, a throw that’s made for the history books, and a spin attack so fast that it’ll make you take off into the sky like a helicopter. Now imagine having all this power with up to five of your friends. Can you already see the shenanigans you can have? To give you a bit of a head start, here are a few tips to get the most from your co-op sessions. One Crown to Rule Them All When you play co-op with friends, the Crown appears on the map for anyone to grab, so you’ll want to get to it first. Everyone will have the Crown powers, but the person wearing the Crown gets the most reserve crown charge and will be able to perform cool moves faster. You’re all working together, but it’s always best to be the best at working together, right? During your play session, there might be a moment when the all-powerful Crown might be stolen or lost, which could be the perfect moment for a bit of friendly competition. The Crown can be picked up by an enemy such as a Tuskar or an Outlaw, and you and your friends will have to claim it back. The one who recovers the Crown now gets the extra boost. There is no PvP in Overthrown, so don’t even think about trying to kill your friend for the Crown. Teamwork Makes the Dream Work Secondly, the more workstations you build in your city, the more citizens will start to spawn in your settlement. When you’re playing with your friends, you can have different people working in different zones and districts so that you can start to get more citizens a bit faster right from the get-go. And don’t forget that not everyone loves all jobs equally. Maybe you love building, but your friend loves combat – that is not a problem! It’s easy to divide the chores amongst each other. Experiment And the final tip that I have is to go out and experiment. When we first started working on Overthrown it was inspired and built primarily around player curiosity. When playing our game, we want players to ask themselves and their friends “Can I do this?” and “What happens if I do that?” To which the answer is “Yes, yes you can” and, “Please try it out!” We’re crafting the game with as much interactivity in mind as possible so that you can experience moments of surprise, playfulness and just silly goofy fun! That’s what makes playing with friends fun! We hope that you like the sound of Overthrown and are keen to check it out either with your friends or by yourself. In Game Preview, we are building Overthrown with community feedback and would love for you to join us on this ride. You’ll be able to start your adventure on December 10 when Overthrown launches into Xbox Game Preview and Game Pass for Xbox consoles and PC.",
