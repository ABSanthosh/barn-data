  "text": "I left off last time on a gag about Eowyn, faced with being left behind and the responsibilities that entailed, heading straight for the mead hall, no doubt to knock back enough mead or other libations to be able to face the task ahead of her. I am not sure how to even take that In reality, having played through a fair portion of the quest chain that starts with the departure of Theodan and the warriors to hand, I am pretty sure Eowyn could not be blamed for wanting to sulk in a dark corner of a mead hall, nursing both her spirits and those in her mug. (Yes, I know, mead is not a spirit, don’t get all Hotel California on me.  I am sure they have some top shelf stuff for the VIPs at the bar.  She looks like she needs a shot and a chaser.) Anyway, things start out tough for her and only get worse, having been left in the lurch by Theodan.  He made all this mess, through neglect then haste, and now she has to clean it up.  At first there is stuff to do right there in town with her.  The people left behind are not happy. Maybe the best NPC name since that drunk elf… and just a quick edit away from alcoholic And some of them are pissed enough to think about resisting.  Fortunately, that was easily dealt with in the old school way of beating the crap out of anybody not towing the party line. Who wants a sock in the face? Put a flaming gold ring over your head! So I went out and beat the peasants for a bit, stifling dissent via provisions in the war powers act of Rohan. But things are not well in Rohan.  I was sent out to check on a nearby settlement where I had to assist the thane with the usual tasks to get his people packed up and on the road to the collection point on the way to Dunharrow. I do all that, we get them in their wagons and on their way… then the thane is all “I have a bad feeling about this” and sends me off to check on them and, sure enough, they’re all dead. All my work undone The thane, Edric… not to be confused with the Blackwold of the same name in the initial Breeland tutorial… is pissed and I have to go with him back to Edoras with him because he wants to speak with my manager about the situation.  He does what five year old me would have done, which is stand outside her house and shout her name. (Seriously, I used to walk down the street to my friend Alan’s house and stand in a special spot across the street, a spot in my young brain designated the yelling spot, and shout his name until he came out to play.  Aside from the idea that I was allowed to just wander the street at that age, Alan’s parents never once told me to just ring the damn doorbell or whatever.  In hindsight I am very much “WTF was going on?” in that situation.  But now I am off on a wild digression.) I know you’re hiding in the mead hall Also, for once it wasn’t just the day night cycle making me do everything in the dark.  They want to make it clear that Edric was shouting this in the middle of the night like freaking Stanley Kowalski.  So Eowyn, who was either still up and drinking or sleeps in her armor, comes out to see what the fuss is about. Established: The thane’s name and the lateness of the hour He’s pissed and Eowyn feels we need to get out and do something, so we’re off to his burg to push back the orcs and help with an orderly retreat of the remaining unslaughtered residents. This is actually where the mead hall image comes in… and the privy image as well, while we’re on the topic. Just another excuse for me to post an outhouse picture This is also where I have one of my classic “didn’t read/understand the quest text” moment, where there is a quest whose goal is both to keep Eowyn alive and to stop the orcs attacking the town palisades.  Easy enough, right?  Done it a dozen or more times, just defend the primary and kill the orcs as they show up. So I sat there, killing orcs, which kept on coming in waves of three until I had the base orc killing deed done, and I wasn’t very far into the 100 orcs you needed to get there, waiting for the quest to tell me that the orcs had had enough and were giving up. Deed unlocked However, after a couple dozen more waves… I am a determined orc slayer… I started to get the feeling there was something else in play here.  At that point I noticed on my mini map that there were four red dots, two on either side of the gate, that I hadn’t interacted with.  So I went over, shot the two on the left, came back and stopped the next wave, then went to the right and did the same and the quest was over. But at least I killed a lot of orcs.  Then there was the wrap up, killing the head orc, who for some reason was on the other side of town.  I mean, he could have gone around, sure, but then all his crew were attacking the palisades why? Yeah, that isn’t going to fly Then, after being seen out in the trenches, Eowyn was back to the mead hall in Edoras, sending me off to continue the ongoing cleaning up of messes. I did get to see some of the land and a few points mentioned in the books.  I road to the big tend camp at the base of the road to Dunharrow, where it seemed that Theodan left the main part of his host judging from the count of tents alone. A lot of you sleeping under canvas in the rain here three minutes from Edoras The quest line that sent me there then put me on the road up to Dunharrow itself, so I got to see the Pukel-men at each turning of the winding path up to the refuge. One of the Pukel-men on the road I did not, in my youthful reading of the books, picture them as being so large.  But what they rendered in the game is worn, with empty eye sockets, as the book described, so I suppose one interpretation is as good as another.  Still though… And then I arrived in Dunharrow… which ended up being just a bunch more tents.  I kind of expected something a little more substantial than a camp ground when it came to the well stocked refuge of Rohan, but what are you going to do.  Easier to copy/paste some more tents I suppose. A brief look at Dunharrow Sure, they have more banners and a nice supply tend compared to the camp at the bottom of the hill, but still, I was expecting more. The quest sent me along to the black door, first mentioned by the old man in scene 24, where we know Aragorn, Gimili, and Legolas are going to venture at some future date.  I didn’t need to DO anything at the door.  The game just wanted to show it to me with a big wink wink, letting me know they have some shit in mind in the future and won’t this be cool.  But first, go clean up stuff. I also realized that Dunharrow was where my Curse of the Valar level boosted ranger captain ended up after being elevated.  Elevated and left gimped as the updated legendary item he was given was not at all up to the task of handling the mobs he was sent to tackle on the first quest.  This was ages ago at this point, but I maintain a mild resentment and a distrust of Turbine and SSG for basically breaking my old captain and then shrugging and pointing at the cash shop as how to fix their inability to do level boosts correctly. That captain stayed at level 95, never to be played again, while my current hunter was already closing in on level 90.  The long path to Mordor turns out to be shorter than the short cut. Anyway, simmering resentments aside, after a brief tour of the place I was sent down the hill again and off to various mead halls to smooth things out and keep the mustering process going. Sometimes business is done over dinner There were contractors to consult, building sites to inspect, walls to be mended, orc camps to be scouted, lumber mill fires to be extinguished, roads to be patrolled, and always boars to be slain. Along the way I ran into some off-brand orcs, which I expect were the result of Mordor importing some discount minions from the far east and then finding out the reason why they were so inexpensive. It says “Mordor Warrior” right here on the invoice dammit! I even ended up in aptly named Fenmarch, on the shores of the Entwash, which was soggy and surrounded by frogs and such.  But even out in a bog they have to keep to tradition, so I met the local thane in what I think of as Swamp Mead Hall. The other thanes said I was mad to build a mead hall in a swamp There, in another classic not reading the quest text moments the thane went on about something while I was doing the Middle-earth equivalent of looking at my phone, only to hear the very end and something about “arrowheads” and responded, “Collect arrowheads, on it!” Turns out those are flowers and not something one picks up and pockets despite warnings at the site of The Little Bighorn.  And, as it came to pass, these were somehow suppose to sooth the feelings of the thane’s daughter, Meregyth, for whom I had brought the news that her betrothed, none less than Eomer, is now heir to the kingdom and so the marrying her is quite impossible due to political considerations.  The lord of the mark does not marry swamp maidens it seems, and the news went down about as one might expect, with Meregyth running off in tears.  Probably threw the flowers away too. Screw you and your arrowheads! I’m sure she’ll be okay… right?  Won’t do anything drastic or throw herself into the swamp or get herself kidnapped by orcs over this… or when she later finds out Eomer ends up with Lothiriel of Dol Armoth down the road in a move to bind Rohan to Gondor even more so through blood. So there was that. And then, after wrapping up that debacle, I turn around and a woman named Lily wants me to go pick some lilies for her and I am all, “What is it with you swamp dwellers and your goddam flowers?”  Don’t these people have some orcs or boars to slay?  Oh, yes, the thane then immediately sent me after boars. At that point, out in a swamp on the Entwash, I hit level 90.",

are going to venture at some future date.  I didn’t need to DO anything at the door.  The game just wanted to show it to me with a big wink wink, letting me know they have some shit in mind in the future and won’t this be cool.  But first, go clean up stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also realized that Dunharrow was where my Curse of the Valar level boosted

was sent to tackle on the first quest.  This was ages ago at this point, but I maintain a mild resentment and a distrust of Turbine and SSG for basically breaking my old captain and then shrugging and pointing at the cash shop as how to fix their inability to do level boosts correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat captain stayed at level 95, never to be played again, while my current hunter was

these were somehow suppose to sooth the feelings of the thane’s daughter, Meregyth, for whom I had brought the news that her betrothed, none less than Eomer, is now heir to the kingdom and so the marrying her is quite impossible due to political considerations.  The lord of the mark does not marry swamp maidens it seems, and the news went down about as one might expect, with Meregyth running off in tears.  Probably threw the flowers away too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_135032\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca
