  "description": "Once your adventure in Dragon Age: The Veilguard draws to a close, you'll find yourself staring at the main menu. But, wait, did you see anything after the credits rolled? Well, there's certainly something that you can unlock during your playthrough, but it's going to take a bit of effort. Here's our guide on how to get the secret post-credits scene in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Likewise, please be reminded that this article contains spoilers.How to get the secret post-credits scene in Dragon Age: The VeilguardThe Dragon Age: The Veilguard post-credits scene only triggers if you're able to acquire all three Mysterious Circles during your playthrough. These strange objects are found in specific areas of the world, and picking them up causes Rook to hear voices.There's actually no quest that notifies you about tracking them down specifically. That's why it's possible to just stumble upon these while exploring. Mysterious Circle #1: Arlathan ForestThe first Dragon Age: The Veilguard Mysterious Circle that you're likely to find is in Arlathan Forest. Specifically, it's in an area called Forest Mire. There's an ornate chest on an island in the middle of a stream, but you won't be able to reach it until you progress a bit further into the campaign.Eventually, the rest of the area opens up, allowing you to explore your surroundings. There, you'll see three beam turrets. Bring the nearby power crystals so you can activate each turret. Then, use them to fire the beam at the floating receptacles on the walls. Once all three receptacles have been activated, you'll be able to cross the river.Take out the Guardian of Secrets enemy and open the chest to obtain a unique helmet called the Iron Veil. If you look behind the chest, you'll spot a floating disk with flames. Now that's a curious sight indeed. Mysterious Circle #2: Necropolis HallsIf you really want the Dragon Age: The Veilguard post-credits scene, then you have to grab the second Mysterious Circle from the Necropolis Halls. Well, technically, it's from several areas. Here's a quick summary:After recruiting Emmrich, return to the Necropolis Halls and complete a quest called Restless Spirits. The objective is to bring the wisps to the receptacles to unlock a doorway.In the next chamber, take out the enemies and walk to the large door with three seals. This starts the Pinnacle of Its Kind quest.The goal in Pinnacle of Its Kind is to defeat three demons, variants of the Formless One, in specific regions. Track the quest so you can quickly find your targets in: Dock TownArlathan ForestHossberg WetlandsAfter defeating the three mini-demons, which are already tough encounters if you're unprepared, return to the Necropolis Halls chamber and be ready for an even harder fight. You'll be up against the true version of the Formless One, a level 40 High Dragon. This beast uses the electric element to call down lightning and blast you with shocking beams. Needless to say, you've got your work cut out for you.If you do manage to defeat your target, don't leave the arena just yet. Instead, look for a small nook at the back to find another Mysterious Circle. Mysterious Circle #3: CrossroadsThis Mysterious Circle in Dragon Age: The Veilguard comes from Beacon Island, the initial area of the Crossroads and, no, it's not going to be a straightforward task. Basically, you have to complete a quest called Heart of Corruption.You can learn more about the steps in our Heart of Corruption guide, but here's a quick summary:You need to defeat champions in specific regions so you can unlock sealed areas in the Crossroads.These areas are guarded by revenants, which are higher level elites. Defeating them nets you their essence.The three essences are needed to remove the wards of the thrice-sealed door.Finally, you have to beat the Revenant Dragon boss, which uses different elemental abilities.Once the Revenant Dragon has been taken care of, check the small nook next to the wolf statue. You should find the third and final floating orb that you need. Explaining the post-credits scene in Dragon Age: The VeilguardNow that you have all three Mysterious Circles, you should be guaranteed to unlock the Dragon Age: The Veilguard post-credits scene. Of course, you still need to complete the finale section. This can take you a couple of hours or so, maybe more if you want to be a completionist to ensure that \"most\" characters survive.In any case, after the credits stop rolling, a cutscene will trigger showing different images--some reference events from Veilguard, while others talk about what had transpired from previous games. The scene ends when a black inverted pyramid with jagged lines forms, and the voice says, \"We come...\"So, what does all this mean? Well, the pyramids are definitely not related to Savathun or the Witness from Destiny 2. Rather, the images might be a warning about the Executors, a shadowy group that operates \"across the sea.\" The organization has had a keen interest regarding events that happen in Thedas, so they might be planning something big. Also, we know very little of the world outside the continent of Thedas, so perhaps this looming threat awaits us in the next game.That does it for our guide on how to get the post-credits scene in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Since this takes place once you're finished with the campaign, perhaps you'd like to keep most of your characters and allies alive, too. We've got a finale and endings guide to help you out.The lands of Thedas are under threat from formidable foes, including some menacing elven gods, and it's up to Rook and their allies to save the day.
