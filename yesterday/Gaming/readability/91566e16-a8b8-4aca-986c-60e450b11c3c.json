Your AIR Career Program SP Rewards Unlike the SP farmers in Uitra and other training systems, I don’t have empty character slots set aside for disposable farming characters, so this wasn’t going to be a long term, cyclical project.  I just wanted to do it once… mostly because I had never bothered up until this point. And I do have alts.  They aren’t disposable because I’ve generally trained them up to fill some needs like being a market and shipping alt in Jita or ferrying ships out to a war front from Jita without getting tangled up in war decs or just being able to do player events in high sec.  One pain of being in a big null sec alliance is that you are pretty much under eternal war dec and have some insta-lockers sitting on the Jita 4-4 undock waiting for you to give them an easy target. I chose Reynaldo, in part because I was in the process of training him up to be a useful auxiliary and in part because he had already done the Sisters of EVE epic arc missions, which is a big chunk of progress for the Enforcer quadrant of the adventure. I actually did the epic arc because I had never done it… or never completed it at least, I think it is partially done on at least three characters… with an eye towards writing about the whole thing.  And then I finished it and realized it was just 50 pretty normal missions, a number of which were just “go to the next agent” sort of thing.  The EVE Uni Wiki has the missions in detail, but basically one near the end… the more difficult “shoot the bad guys” mission that the rest… is all you really need to be ready for.  The rest is travel, so a speedy ship is handy.  There are lots of recommendations, but I went with a Sunesis fit. [Sunesis, SOE Arc - Shield MWD Pulse Small Focused] Damage Control II Heat Sink II Extruded Compact Heat Sink Inertial Stabilizers II 5MN Quad LiF Restrained Microwarpdrive Fleeting Compact Stasis Webifier Data Analyzer I Medium Azeotropic Restrained Shield Extender Small Focused Pulse Laser II Small Focused Pulse Laser II Small Focused Pulse Laser II Small Low Friction Nozzle Joints II Small Hyperspatial Velocity Optimizer II Small Hyperspatial Velocity Optimizer II Hobgoblin II x4 Warrior II x4 Scorch S x3 Conflagration S x6 Imperial Navy Multifrequency S x3 It helped that I had accumulated a number of Sunesis hulls over the years from CCP rewards, though I did have to train up to get small pulse laser specialization for the weapons. Sunesis on the move For Dagan, the difficult mission, it was just kill his support, then web him, orbit him at 2,500, and hit him with drones and lasers.  I chose Caldari for the empire to boost my rep with, despite being Gallente, because any discount in Jita is good. Having done that ahead of time I dove into the four paths of the AIR missions. Enforcer After the epic arc the Enforcer path was pretty easy and mostly done for me.  It is a lot of run missions, kill NPCs, get bounties, earn LP, and run the career agent missions.  I had done most of that by virtue of simply having had the character around since 2009.  So that was knocked out without having to invest too much time. Explorer Next up was exploration… which I had also done a fair chunk of by simply doing other things in New Eden.  It is almost as if they want you to be rewarded for going about your business and finding new things to do in the game and not merely serve as a way to use alts to farm skill points.  Imagine! I was helped along quite a bit by having done a bunch of hacking in the Crimson Harvest and Winter Nexus events, Reynaldo being one of the aforementioned high sec characters used to run events.  I still had to run the career agent missions… I had to do that for all of them… and travel a bit through low sec and null sec and wormhole space, but that wasn’t tough and I was able to double up with the Soldier of Fortune missions.   I did everything besides advanced hacking and gas sites and was done. Industrialist Industrialist wasn’t too bad.  I ended up skipping Salvage and Distribution Agents mostly because I had other things done.  The resource harvesting and processing are paired sets, where you harvest a specific amount of an ore type then refine the same amount of that ore type.  I had to travel for a couple of the ores as they only show up in specific empire space, but Kernite I was able to skip because I had done some mining missions for the Daily AIR Goals at one point, and they include a Kernite class ore.  That didn’t help me with refining, but every trade hub has some for sale, so I just bought 4K of it and refined. All of that gave me minerals to do some of the other tasks, including the inevitable career agent stuff.  Not so bad.  I did have to find buy a shuttle blueprint… pretty cheap… then find a structure to do the research on it… but that was viable.  And again due to just being around for a long time, I had blueprint copies of a frigate, destroyer, and a cruiser sitting around from the era when CCP was handing those out as part of daily login rewards. Soldier of Fortune Which left me with the Soldier of Fortune path.  I had absolutely done the least in advance on that, it being the PvP focused path.  But I had done a bit.  The combat section requires blowing up 75 enemies in a frigate, destroyer, and cruiser, and NPCs count, so the fact that I had run missions in the past and had done the SOE epic arc set me up there at least. Also, the Social section, which includes things like sending a chat, joining a corp, and joining a fleet was mostly done.  I just have to send an in-game email and I was set. The career agent missions are a bit spicier than the enforcer missions… there is one where you are expected to lose your ship… and they can be a drag if you try to use just what the missions give you.  But if you have a go-fast Kestrel fit to send light missiles 105km down range while moving 3,200 m/s, you can blitz through pretty fast. My Kestrel in the final Soldier of Fortune mission But then there was a whole host of things that required you to disrupt, scram, point, web, neut, nos, paint, rep, and duel other players.  I had to do pretty much ALL of that from scratch.  Fortunately, the EVE Uni Wiki guide to the whole thing has a fit to cover your needs.  Here is the “do it all” fit: [Gnosis, AIR - Gnosis - SoF] Reinforced Bulkheads I Reinforced Bulkheads I Capacitor Flux Coil I Capacitor Flux Coil I Capacitor Flux Coil I Capacitor Flux Coil I Warp Scrambler I Warp Disruptor I Tracking Disruptor I Target Painter I Stasis Webifier I Cap Recharger I Large Remote Shield Booster I Large Remote Armor Repairer I Medium Energy Nosferatu I Medium Energy Nosferatu I Medium Energy Neutralizer I Small Energy Neutralizer I Hobgoblin I x5 With that you do need a partner… but I have two active Omega accounts and, as with the Sunesis, a pile of Gnosis hulls left over from various hand outs.  So you just fleet up, warp out to some spot… or just sit on the undock if you like, nothing you’re doing is against the rules so you might as well flaunt it… challenge each other to a duel, and turn on all the modules. I felt enough shame to warp to a planet You also want to unleash your drones on each other to burn each other down to about half armor so you can then turn on the armor and shield reps.  That will knock out electronic warfare, capacitor warfare, support, and get you started on duels pretty fast. Once that is done, you your timers run down and the duel time out… duels need not end in destruction it seems… then one of your pair can dock back up, board one of the shuttles you built with your now researched blueprint, undock, fly back to the Gnosis out in space, start another duel and then let the Gnosis pop the shuttle.  Rinse and repeat until you get to five kills and that covers the PvP category and gets you well on your way with duels. I think people often just carry on from there to get on to 15 duels and 20 ships lost for the character in the shuttle, but I didn’t go that far.  With Reynaldo I managed five losses to get the other character their five kills, then just did some AFK shuttle auto-piloting to various corners of low and null sec to cover some of the explorer goals as well.  That was pretty easy except for the one time I ended up alive in a system in Cobalt Edge because nobody cared enough to shoot me as I auto-piloted there. Embarrassing PandaFam!  I actually had to auto-pilot all the way to J5A before INIT blew me up. And by the time I was at 15 losses I had passed the 750 point mark and was done. Conclusions I was done.  All 750K skill points had been collected along with a range of SKINs, ISK, and other random things you get to claim along the way.  The whole thing leaves a lot of junk in your hangar. All four AIR Career Paths Complete Did I do it in the most efficient of economical way?  Probably not.  I am pretty sure I did not make the 12 hour mark overall that the EVE Uni guide suggests could be accomplished. But it does seem doable and I did collect 750 thousand skill points.  I can see why people do continue to do it, continue to blow up shuttles is such quantity that Uitra came the undisputed destruction champion for 2024.  (I did my run in Pasha, so did not add to that particular total.) Will I do it again?  I mean, I have two more high sec alts currently.  Maybe. I do wonder why CCP allows the rewards to land in the redemption queue, where they can be claimed by your main, rather than forcing them to be redeemed directly to the character who earned them, they way they do with the AIR daily goals.  I can only guess that it boosts some activity metric they track internally.  It seems like a silly thing to allow and a fairly easy issue to resolve, but they just keep letting it ride.

then there was a whole host of things that required you to disrupt, scram, point, web, neut, nos, paint, rep, and duel other players.  I had to do pretty much ALL of that from scratch.  Fortunately, the EVE Uni Wiki guide to the whole thing has a fit to cover your needs.  Here is the “do it all” fit:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e[Gnosis, AIR - Gnosis - SoF]\nReinforced Bulkheads I\nReinforced

hand outs.  So you just fleet up, warp out to some spot… or just sit on the undock if you like, nothing you’re doing is against the rules so you might as well flaunt it… challenge each other to a duel, and turn on all the modules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_131782\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

about half armor so you can then turn on the armor and shield reps.  That will knock out electronic warfare, capacitor warfare, support, and get you started on duels pretty fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce that is done, you your timers run down and the duel time out… duels need not end in destruction it seems… then one of your pair can dock back up, board one of the shuttles you built with your now researched blueprint, undock, fly back to the Gnosis out in space, start another duel and then let the Gnosis pop the shuttle.  Rinse and repeat until you get to five kills and that covers the PvP category and gets you well on your way with duels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think people often just carry on from there to get on to 15 duels and 20 ships lost for the character in the shuttle, but I didn’t go that far.  With Reynaldo I managed five losses to get the other character their five kills, then just did some AFK shuttle auto-piloting to various corners of low and null sec to cover some of the explorer goals as well.  That was pretty easy except for the one time I ended up alive in a system in Cobalt Edge because nobody cared enough to shoot me as I auto-piloted there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmbarrassing PandaFam!  I actually had to auto-pilot all the way to J5A before INIT blew me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd by the time I was at 15 losses I had passed the 750 point mark and was done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eConclusions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was done.  All 750K skill points had been collected along with a

can see why people do continue to do it, continue to blow up shuttles is such quantity that Uitra came the undisputed destruction champion for 2024.  (I did my run in Pasha, so did not add to that particular total.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill I do it again?  I mean, I have two more high sec alts currently.  Maybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do wonder why CCP allows the rewards to land in the redemption queue, where they can be claimed by your main, rather than forcing them to be redeemed directly to the character who earned them, they way they do with the AIR daily goals.  I can only guess that it boosts some activity metric they track internally.  It seems like a silly thing to allow and a fairly easy issue to resolve, but they just keep letting it
