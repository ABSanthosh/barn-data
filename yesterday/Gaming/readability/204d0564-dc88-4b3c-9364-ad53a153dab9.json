Pokemon Go – Since 2016 Back in July when my wife and I made it to level 46 it looked like the four required tasks might be an issue for me.  They were as follows: Tasks to get level 47 The first one, the 30 raids, I didn’t think would be tough.  It would just be a matter of remembering to do it.  I knocked that one out pretty quickly, as did my wife, even though she kept forgetting about it.  But we do enough raids that it wasn’t an issue in the end. The second one was a gimme, because you don’t have to do it alone.  My wife and I knocked that one out together. The final one, the 20 platinum badges… my wife had that done already.  I had a few paths forward on that and eventually it turned out not to be a gating item for me. Which leaves us with that third task.  My wife managed to knock that one out and is now level 47. I, on the other hand, have not.  I only have 1 of the required 3 max CP Pokemon. The state of my level 47 tasks The reason my wife has this done is that it requires a lot of XL candies and a lot of and, since she catches about twice as many Pokemon as I do given our account stats, that was less of an issue for her than I. For the first part, most Pokemon need 296 XL candies to get to max CP. An example Slaking You get XL candies randomly, usually one at a time, from all the usual things like catching, raiding, hatching eggs, and so on.  You can also trade in normal candy for XL candy at a rate of 100 normal to 1 XL.  That is pretty steep, but as it turns out, my wife had thousands of candy available for a few common species of Pokemon. I did not. I did not because the way I keep up with my wife on the xp front is to strategically evolve Pokemon when I have a lucky egg going.  I try never to waste a double xp opportunity, so any species that accumulates candy gets evolved a lot. Still, I thought I might have a path forward in that I also train up my Pokemon.  My wife tends to leave her Pokemon at whatever CP level they stand while I find the three star Pokemon and level up their CP. So I thought I might have advanced some of my top Pokemon far enough that I might not need the whole 296 load of XL candy.  So I went digging through my Pokemon. The first thing I noticed is that the UI for how close to max CP a Pokemon is kind of sucks… and that was only after I noticed there even was a UI element trying to show you that. Going back to that Slaking, there is an arc behind each Pokemon in their display when you look at them individually that shows their progress towards max CP. Slaking slaking off as usual That orange bit only shows up because I opened up the power up option and hit the negative to get the image above showing.  It gives a sense of how far you need to go, but it isn’t very precise and you really need to go into each and every Pokemon and click the power up button to see how many XL candies you really need. Oh, and you can only click on the power up button if you have enough candies to actually power the Pokemon up.  So if they next step requires 14 XL candies and you only have 10, forget about it.  No total for you. So I dragged through a lot of Pokemon to find some options. As it turned out, a lot of my highest CP Pokemon, where I thought I might find an easy win, were still pretty far away.  Most of my Pokemon were.  I was lucky to find anybody who needed fewer than 200 XL candy. The first up was my Gyrados, who I immediately made my buddy.  Magikarp/Gyrados are 1km buddies, which means walking around with them they earn a candy, and often an XL candy, for every 1km you go.  It wasn’t going to be easy.  He still needed about 120 XL candies, which is a lot of walking for me, but I got him on his way.  He is currently down to what I believe is the last power up, and has 17 of the 20 XL candies needed for that.  I can’t tell you for sure because I don’t have the 20 XL candies needed to check.  But he is close. My second pick, and my first Pokemon to max CP, was a shiny Persian, the Meowth evolution, where I happened to have a lot of candy saved up. Persian with plenty of candies Also, when I started looking into this seriously… another thing is that I probably waited too long to do that… Halloween was coming up, and lots of Meowths would be out and about, so not only did I have a leg up with the candies, but the opportunity to earn more was present. And that was a key aspect of my choice.  Since I wasn’t very close anywhere, how to get those additional XL candies was key.  So I got Persian there off of Halloween. Persian at Max CP You would think that CP arc would change color or something at max CP… but it doesn’t.  Poor UI design in some ways. For the third I bounced around a bit.  I started with a Jolteon, an Eevee evolution, because I thought those are always around, so it might be a path forward.  But it was also slow and Eevee is a 5km buddy, so it takes a lot longer to get candies from walking. Joleton close, but not close enough I think I am still a good 50+ XL candies from max CP with him, though the UI isn’t helpful on that and I don’t have the candies to check.  I complain about that a lot. Then I swapped to a Vivillon as my target.  I happened to have a perfect three star River Vivillon. Vivillon making its way up While you cannot catch Scatterbugs in the wild, you can get them to show up by saving postcards from gifts from people on your friends list… and at some point I will need to do a post about the management of your friends list… so one will pop up every fifteen postcards saved per region, and each one is an opportunity to earn an XL candy. So if you’re on my friends list, that is why I suddenly started saving postcards again even though I completed the Vivillon collection back in September. Also, Vivillon is a 1km buddy, so it is easy to earn candies that way too… though Vivillon did not seem to earn XL candies as reliably as my Gyrados.  That was my path forward, and Vivillon was soon up and past Jolteon. Then we had the big Necrozma community day raid even a few weekends back.  That was the second raid event for Necrozma this year and this time around I noticed that not only did I have a bunch of candies leftover from that, but that for each raid we were earning 3 XL candies for just winning, and another 2-5 for for each catch. We were down at the community center, parked by the old post office, where you can sit in your car and be in range of four Pokemon gyms so could catch four raids every 30 minutes, plus a couple of remote raids if you had the inclination… and once I saw the trends, I very much had the inclination.  I blew all of my in-game currency and made us stay there in the car until I had 297 Necrozma XL candies in hand. The XL candy problem had been solved… so on to the next problem. I picked a perfect, three star Necrozma from the ones I had caught and quickly burned through the normal candy stage and started using a few XL candies to level him up. Necrozma after spending 20 XL candies And then I ran into the other barrier; stardust. Stardust is required for a number of things, including powering up Pokemon.  This is one where my wife, having caught nearly two times as many Pokemon as I have of the last eight years, had not issue all.  She has almost 3 million units of stardust sitting around and was amazed I was not also rolling in the stuff. My wife does not tend to her Pokemon as I do.  She does not power them up unless there is a daily task for that, and even then she tends to pick the lowest CP Pokemon.  She also does not purify shadow Pokemon, which is a whole additional thing, the way I do.  I wanted the platinum medal for that, so I have purified many, and that runs 2-5K of stardust each. So now I have all the XL candies for my Necrozma… and one to spare… but not enough stardust. I have 110K stardust currently So now I have two barriers left between me and level 47.  I have the XP aspect of the level covered and then some. I am banking XP against the next level at this point The first is earning a few more XL candies with my Gyrados buddy.  Time for another afternoon walk. The second is to earn a little more than 100K in stardust, which one gets through doing all the Pokemon Go things, like catching Pokemon, fighting in the Battle League, spinning Pokestops, opening gifts from friends, hatching eggs, raiding, and whatever else. I have a path forward.  I just need to get to the end of it.",

usually one at a time, from all the usual things like catching, raiding, hatching eggs, and so on.  You can also trade in normal candy for XL candy at a rate of 100 normal to 1 XL.  That is pretty steep, but as it turns out, my wife had thousands of candy available for a few common species of Pokemon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not because the way I keep up with my wife on the xp front is to strategically evolve Pokemon when I have a lucky egg going.  I try never to waste a double xp opportunity, so any species that accumulates candy gets evolved a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I thought I might have a path forward in that I also train up my Pokemon.  My wife tends to leave her Pokemon at whatever CP level they stand while I find the three star Pokemon and level up their CP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I thought I might have advanced some of my top Pokemon far enough that I might not need the whole 296 load of XL candy.  So I went digging through my Pokemon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing I noticed is that the UI for how close to max CP a Pokemon is kind of sucks… and that was only after I noticed there even was a UI element trying to show you that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing back to that Slaking, there is an arc behind each Pokemon in their display when you look at them individually that shows their progress towards max CP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_125975\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

orange bit only shows up because I opened up the power up option and hit the negative to get the image above showing.  It gives a sense of how far you need to go, but it isn’t very precise and you really need to go into each and every Pokemon and click the power up button to see how many XL candies you really need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, and you can only click on the power up button if you have enough candies to actually power the Pokemon up.  So if they next step requires 14 XL candies and you only have 10, forget about it.  No total for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I dragged through a lot of Pokemon to find some options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it turned out, a lot of my highest CP Pokemon, where I thought I might find an easy win, were still pretty far away.  Most of my Pokemon were.  I was lucky to find anybody who needed fewer than 200 XL candy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first up was my Gyrados, who I immediately made my buddy.  Magikarp/Gyrados are 1km buddies, which means walking around with them they earn a candy, and often an XL candy, for every 1km you go.  It wasn’t going to be easy.  He still needed about 120 XL candies, which is a lot of walking for me, but I got him on his way.  He is currently down to what I believe is the last power up, and has 17 of the 20 XL candies needed for that.  I can’t tell you for sure because I don’t have the 20 XL candies needed to check.  But he is close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy second pick, and my first Pokemon to max CP, was a shiny Persian, the Meowth evolution, where I happened to have a lot of candy saved up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_125977\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

collection\u003c/a\u003e back in September.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, Vivillon is a 1km buddy, so it is easy to earn candies that way too… though Vivillon did not seem to earn XL candies as reliably as my Gyrados.  That was my path forward, and Vivillon was soon up and past Jolteon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we had the big Necrozma community day raid even a few weekends back.  That was the second raid event for Necrozma this year and this time around I noticed that not only did I have a bunch of candies leftover from that, but that for each raid we were earning 3 XL candies for just winning, and another 2-5 for for each catch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were down at the community center, parked by the old post office, where you can sit in your car and be in range of four Pokemon gyms so could catch four raids every 30 minutes, plus a couple of remote raids if you had the inclination… and once I saw the trends, I very much had the inclination.  I blew all of my in-game currency and made us stay there in the car until I had 297 Necrozma XL candies in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe XL candy problem had been solved… so on to the next problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked a perfect, three star Necrozma from the ones I had caught and quickly burned through the normal candy stage and started using a few XL candies to level him up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_125992\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

into the other barrier; stardust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStardust is required for a number of things, including powering up Pokemon.  This is one where my wife, having caught nearly two times as many Pokemon as I have of the last eight years, had not issue all.  She has almost 3 million units of stardust sitting around and was amazed I was not also rolling in the stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy wife does not tend to her Pokemon as I do.  She does not power them up unless there is a daily task for that, and even then she tends to pick the lowest CP Pokemon.  She also does not purify shadow Pokemon, which is a whole additional thing, the way I do.  I wanted the platinum medal for that, so I have purified many, and that runs 2-5K of stardust each.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now I have all the XL candies for my Necrozma… and one to spare… but not enough stardust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\"
