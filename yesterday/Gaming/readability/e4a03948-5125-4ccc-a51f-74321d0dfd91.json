  "text": "Golfie brings cards and randomness to golf, letting players make wild changes to the ball’s behavior to reach its randomly-generated holes. Golf is a boring, silly sport that primarily seems to be made up of men drinking on a big bit of grass. However, Golfie isn’t your average, traditional golf game. This is a run-based roguelike minigolf deck builder where you and your friends need to make your way through procedurally generated levels, gaining speed as you go! I played a demo of Golfie at Pocket Gamer Connects Helsinki where I started off as a normal golf ball trying to hit my way through an island playing field that had a lot of gaps and areas that made it hard to play there. The controls felt quite good, with the ball moving quickly and making satisfying jumps through the air. It was a challenging yet fantastic demo level and I quite enjoyed how juicy the game felt. Your goal is to get to the end of each level, but sometimes you can use cards to help you with that, switching up the game. Cards can save you when it comes to a particularly tough hole as you can do all sorts of things to help yourself. You can use parachutes to glide right to the end, walls can be placed to help you avoid specific areas of the map and stop you from falling off the map altogether, and more. These cards do use up energy, especially if you end up finishing the round over par. If you lose all of your energy, it will end the game and you will have lost. I did not get to play Golfie with a bunch of friends, but I can see how chaotic and fun this would be as a multiplayer game with everyone flying through the air and using cards when they need to. It’s a fun party game that clearly has a lot of fantastic moments that can be made. Golfie is available now on Steam.
