  "text": "Image credit: Velan Studios/PlayStation Velan Studios, the team behind the sadly ill-fated Knockout City, has announced its PlayStation-published pitch-black FPS Midnight Murder Club is launching into PC and PS5 early access on 13th March. And as an added incentive to make a purchase, up to five friends can play for free. Midnight Murder Club sets players loose in the pitch-black interior of Wormwood Manor - arming them with a revolver and flashlight, and then challenging them to be the last person standing. \"You sprint toward your friends' shouting voices echoing through the mansion, only to bump into someone else hiding in a dark corner!\", Velan enthuses in a bout of scene-setting on the PlayStation Blog. \"Shots ring out, luring the other hunters to your location. Every flash of light is the promise of a deadly firefight.\" Midnight Murder Club's choatic action comes in five distinct flavours. There's a Free for All mode, as well as Thief in the Night, Team Deathmatch, Headhunters, and the newly announced Wildcards mode. This last one lets everyone play cards in their collection to twist the rules of a match - perhaps giving participants super speed or causing them to explode in a fiery ball on death - with new cards unlocking once the match is over. Midnight Murder Club - Wildcards Developer Diary | PS5 \u0026 PC Games Midnight Murder Club developer diary.Watch on YouTube Perhaps the most notable aspect of today's announcement, however, is the news purchasers can invite their friends to play along at no extra cost. Friends will first need to download the free Midnight Murder Club Guest Pass Edition, and after that, purchasers can invite up to five of them to play public or private matches, in all current game modes, as much as they want. Midnight Murder Club launches into Steam and PlayStation 5 early access on 13th March, and will cost $19.99 USD for the full game.",
