  "text": "Image credit: Square Enix Nier: Automata producer Yosuke Saito and director Yoko Taro have denied that any of their character designs were restricted for Western audiences. As spotted by Automaton, the developers were compelled to comment after a mistranslated Japanese-to-English subtitle intimated Nier: Automata had been subjected to censorship from Square Enix to meet global standards. GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE | Producers' Creative Dialogue Special Livestream GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE | Producers' Creative Dialogue Special Livestream.Watch on YouTube In the interview above (skip to 28:12 for the segment concerned), Sony executive Yoshida Shuhei asked the developers about their design process. \"Our concept is always to do something that's 'not like anything else'. What I mean is, if Nier: Replicant had a boy as the main character, Nier: Automata would have a girl protagonist. If Western sci-fi is filled with Marine-like soldiers, we might go in the opposite direction and use Gothic Lolita outfits, for example,\" Taro said. \"We tend to take the contrarian route.\" \"There are, of course, certain things that are ethically or morally inappropriate – even if they're just aspects of a character,\" Saito added, according to the subtitles. \"We try to draw a line by establishing rules about what’s acceptable and what’s not. \"While certain things might be acceptable in Japan, they could become problematic in certain overseas regions, and even characters could become problematic as well. These are the kind of situation[s] we usually try to avoid creating. As a result, there are actually countries where we couldn't officially release Nier: Automata.\" This immediately caused consternation with fans but as Automaton points out, this \"could be a little tricky to translate, even for an advanced Japanese speaker\". When asked directly about the claim, Taro denied it, saying on X/Twitter: \"I've never heard of such a thing happening\". Saito simply said he thought the things he'd mentioned had been mistranslated, and would clarify this in a future livestream. In the same interview, former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida called Nier: Automata the \"game that changed everything\", as it was responsible for reviving the Japanese games industry on its release. In a recent interview, Yoshida discussed how during the PS3 era, sales of Japanese games had declined, and increasingly studios there were chasing \"overseas tastes\". That changed with NieR: Automata in 2017, released for the PS4. \"I think Yoko Taro created it without paying any mind at all to making it sell overseas, but it was a tremendous success,\" Yoshida said.",
