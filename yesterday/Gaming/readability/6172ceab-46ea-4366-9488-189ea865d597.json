A comment from valued RPS community member #1694 a few weeks back reminded me that I once spent a long time tracking down good SF/Fantasy/Horror short story magazines. Partly for pitching purposes, and partly because I was just really excited such things still existed. Short stories are my favourite form of fiction, and finding such a trove was a treat. Anyway, I figured a few of you might find my list useful. Not all of these are still active, and a few have sadly shut down quite recently, but digital back issues are usually still available online. Enjoy! Lightspeed Beneath Ceaseless Skies Cosmic Horror Monthly Clarkesworld Black Static Interzone Galaxy’s Edge Apex Vastarien Weird Tales (yep, the original Weird Tales has been back for a few years) Apex Bust Down the Door and Eat All the Chickens (‘Bizzaro fiction’ is a rabbit hole I highly recommend) As a bonus, my favourite collections of short stories from individual authors I’ve read recently are: The Dangers of Smoking In Bed by Mariana Enriquez, Her Body And Other Parties by Carmen Maria Machado, and A Collapse Of Horses by Brian Evenson.
