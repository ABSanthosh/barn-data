  "text": "After my diversion to the North Downs and then to Rivendell, I finally ended up at my desired destination, which was Evendim.  I rolled up to the stable master in Oatbarton ready to begin on the zone. Back in Oatbarton again! I think my primary interest in Evendim is that there are things to do… which is to say it is one of those zones created during a time when the zone design meta for MMORPGs was leaning towards quest hubs with a dozen quests to vacuum up so you could just set out slaying. The Lone Lands is like that in places as well, but Evendim dials it up a notch. Or it does when you get into it.  First you have to get through the preliminaries in Oatbarton. Oatbarton is distinguished from most of the zone in that it lays within the bounds for the Shire.  In part that means that you can do some deeds for the Shire, like the spiders.  But it also means that you end up doing a pile of very Shire-like quests… which is to say a lot of fetching and carrying and sweeping up after things. I know, I know, a lot of you love that whole Shire vibe of pie eating contests and avoiding the nosy neighbors and visiting the Green Dragon Inn.  My in-game character persona is much more into… ermm… elimination and asset acquisition.  I don’t mind fetching your pies, but I am better at it if said pies are in some ruins infested with bandits who stole your pies and you want there to be no witnesses as to their return. And I don’t mind a bit of it, but Oatbarton definitely pushes my limit on that front, which is mostly okay because the core of the quests are contained in a small area of little homesteads and patches of field hidden away in what is effectively a minor hedge maze. Some openings in the hedge, but you are pretty constrained So I ran around and did the things… collected the sheep, milked the cows, harvested the wheat, picked the flowers, stomped on the grapes, delivered the pies, chased off various bits of vermin, and even dried the pipe week. Laying it out on the drying rack You even get to try a bit of the supply, and believe you me there is a reason Hobbits are always happy and silly and constantly have the munchies. The race of man cannot hold their smoke. That’s what it is. Most of this is pretty simple, if somewhat tiresome, because it requires you to run around a lot.  It is nice to have the hunter run speed buff.  Also, vague memories help guide me along.  But then I get hung up on something that I cannot find and I run in circles forever until I figure it out. The regulars in that routine include the scarecrows, which are hidden behind a building and I have to run past it several times before I find them.  Then I can find the spots for the first four, because they are in empty fields, but the other two are hidden in wheat fields and you cannot see them unless you get close. Then there are the two hobbits you have to help who are not in the area with everybody else, but are down the hill in Oatbarton where you started.  I remembered that this time around!  Hal and Nibs have some “go kill some things” quests at least. All of this is part of one meta quest chain to help setup a party, so I wanted to get the lot done before I moved on down the road to Dwaling.  [Also: a 2011 post about Oatbarton or a 2018 post about the place, if you are interested the evolution of my views.] Dwaling is still in the Shire, but it is on the hairy footed edge thereof, so there is danger about and mobs to slay.  I mean, the hobbits are still baked and primarily interested in their handmade crafts shop, but when they send you out for supplies they mean you to take them off of the corpses of the local fauna.  It all has a Shire air about it, but at least I got to use my bow. The Dwaling Crafting Commune It is also the borderland between the Shire and Evendim proper.  Killing spiders close to the camp applies to my deeds for the Shire, but when I get out on the beach and tackle salamanders, which they want for a craft project, those are Evendim deeds. When they can get past their glass blowing, they do seem a bit concerned about the ruffians who have taken over the settlement down the hill, and I have to fetch some items from there… again, right up my alley skill-wise, and then send me off to deliver an eviction notice. We, the undersigned, wish to express our displeasure… That is actually the quest chain you need to complete to get sent along.  I declined to get involved with the whole goblin camp quest chain, in part because I recall it being a lot of back and forth, and in part because the quests in Dwaling were all aqua blue in difficulty to me, bordering on green when I got a level up, so I felt pretty good about just moving on. I have to remind myself, this is not a completionist run.  I want to move forward to Mordor.  I need to catch up.  The fellowship has… looking at the calendar… nearly an eighteen year head start on me at this point. So I got the quest sending me to High Kings Landing, and I took it and rode off, the destination being easy to spot. Subtlety was not part of the craft of Numenor Here lays a ranger camp, and they have a bunch of quests for anybody wandering by, many of which help feed the “lazy ranger” theme that might have started building in the back of your head after working with Candaith, the ranger in repose in the Lone Lands. The ranger camp… with not much going on Here at least you start to get stuck into the local ruins and the tomb-robbers that seem to litter the land.  It is actually a good thing they are so plentiful I suppose, as the deed progression as you level up mean you need to slay 90 of them for the basic deed, and 180 for the advanced deed. Do you think I am made of tomb robbers? But I will get to that routine in another post. The objectives are fairly clear and those that are not I at least recall from past runs… so I go get stuck in to the bads with enough force that I wrap up the base deed, as noted in the image above.  I also pick up a lot of their sashes, which can be consumed for rep with the locals. Reputation on a roll I, of course, forgot that at the next location there will be a quest to collect ten of those sashes, and I will arrive there empty handed.  But there is no shortage of tomb-robbers. This is also where you start getting rewarded with Coins of Annuminas, which can only be spent at their shop, which makes me think of something else. Where can I spend my Annuminas coins? But I always think about that sort of thing when games gate stores based both on rep and on having some special new currency that is only good in a specific area of content. There was a bit of comedy as when, on the way to a quest objective, I slaughter all he tomb-robber scouts I see… gotta increment that deed… only to get to the ranger I need to talk to who immediately sends me out to kill tomb-robber scouts.  I think of that whole “bears, bears, bears” thing from 2008 as I slaughter random mobs while I wait for respawns. Eventually the rangers run out of busy work for me as I wrap up the tasks they had no doubt been neglecting while hanging around the camp fire… also, their camp fire is NOT an actually camp fire that I can set as a hunter travel spot, so screw those guys… playing cards and doing whatever it is they do when I am not around and send me off to Tinnudir. This is actually where I came in from the North Downs.  I am now into what I feel is the core of the zone.  I recognize some of the main NPCs and know many of the quests. Orc-hall-veh? Orc-hall-way? I am now deep in the zone and on the lake and it is only a matter of time before I have to take a swim or spend a mithril coin on a boat ride to get to other destinations along the water.  There are just two major quest hubs left that I recall, plus some minor stops along the way. Evendim so far Once I knock those out, it will be time to get back to the epic quest line.",

they are in empty fields, but the other two are hidden in wheat fields and you cannot see them unless you get close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there are the two hobbits you have to help who are
