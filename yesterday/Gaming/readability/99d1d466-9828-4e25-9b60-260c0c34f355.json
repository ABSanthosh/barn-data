  "text": "For Cyber Monday, Amazon has the lowest price on one of the best gaming handhelds on the market, especially if you prefer a Windows-based operating system. Right now you can pick up a Lenovo Legion Go gaming handheld for only $472.97 shipped after a 32% off instant discount. The Legion Go shares similar specs with the Asus ROG Ally Z1 Extreme, but the Legion Go benefits from a bigger and sharper display, detachable controllers, and a larger battery.Lenovo Legion Go 512GB Gaming HandheldLenovo Legion Go AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme 512GB Gaming HandheldThe Lenovo Legion Go is a Windows-based gaming handheld that's powered by an AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme APU with Radeon graphics and 16GB RAM, which is the same configuration as the one found in the $700 Asus ROG Ally Z1 Extreme. The Legion Go also boasts a a bigger and sharper 8.8\" 2560x1600 144Hz IPS touchscreen display and detachable controllers like the Nintendo Switch. Since the Legion Go operates off Windows 11, it works with most PC game clients, including Steam, Origin, Ubisoft, Epic Games, Genshin Impact, Battle.net, and more.In Jacqueline Thomas' Lenovo Legion Go review, she wrote that \"it is easily the best handheld gaming PC on the market right now as measured by screen size, horsepower, and USB-C port placement, but there are some caveats. It's absolutely massive, and the 1600p display is more than even this powerhouse chip can handle. That means you're going to have to spend some time tinkering with – and specifically lowering – quality settings to get your games running properly. Even then the battery life isn’t great, and naturally you’re paying a premium over the Steam Deck OLED for the bigger display, a full Windows 11 license, and extra oomph. But if you love the idea of the Switch, where you can remove the controllers, prop the screen up on a beefy kickstand, and sit back and enjoy? This is the one for you.\"After the article was written, the Asus ROG Ally X was released and has taken over the throne as the new \"best gaming handheld\". However, the Ally X is far more expensive: even with today's Cyber Monday deal, it still costs $699.99. The Legion Go is definitely a much better value for the price.If you end up getting this deal, we'd recommend picking up a portable power bank for extended travels and a Micro SD card. We've compared the Steam Deck to the ROG Ally and although the Legion Go isn't mentioned, the article gives you a good idea of the major differences between a Steam-based and Windows-based gaming handheld.Will the Deals Change for Cyber Monday?In my experience, many of the same deals we saw on Black Friday will return for Cyber Monday 2024, including deals that were sold out or expired. Retailers usually release their hottest selling items in batches so that every sale event has at least some inventory reserved. That said, I also expect plenty of new, never before seen deals. Traditionally, Black Friday was known as the \"retail holiday,\" where the best deals were found in-store, and Cyber Monday was known as the \"online holiday,\" where the best deals were online only. Although today the lines have blurred, it is still true that many online only retailers still consider Cyber Monday the sale event of the year instead of Black Friday. Expect some amazing sales to come out of online-only sites like Amazon, Newegg, Dell, HP, Lenovo and several online-only deals from traditional retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. In fact, Amazon has taken the preemptive and already switched over to Cyber Monday.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
