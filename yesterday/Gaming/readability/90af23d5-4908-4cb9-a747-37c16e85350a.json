  "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Last Halloween costume you wore? Hmm, a couple years ago I was a panda! It was a low-effort panda though. LOL! 2. Best and worst Halloween candy? I used to love Snickers, but now I find them too sweet, so please give me all the Ghrirardelli Caramel Squares.
