Her most famous book, Pride and Prejudice, has been adapted into various films and tv shows as well as repurposed for modern audiences. As the book that inspired the hit Netflix series, Bridgerton, it isn't hard to see just how far the work of Jane Austen has spread into our culture.Now LEGO is taking it one step further by creating the first ever Jane Austen set. The tribute is the current gift with purchase you can get directly from the LEGO website, and it will only be available until June 27 or while supplies last.LEGO Tribute to Jane Austen's Books SetLEGO Tribute to Jane Austen's BooksThe LEGO Tribute to Jane Austen's Books, set #40766, is only 361 pieces in total. With so few pieces, however, it still manages to pack a lot into one little scene. The set itself is essentially an open book that features a depiction of Jane Austen's home. The scene contains a small writing table with a quill, a piano with sheet music, a bookshelf, a fireplace, and multiple paintings on the wall showcasing scenes from the various film adaptations of her work. It also comes with a little Jane Austen minifigure that you can choose to place inside or outside her home. As LEGO's most recent gift with purchase, you cannot buy this set separately. You'll need to spend at least $150 if you want to get it. This book-themed set is seemingly continuing LEGO's venture into literature as it has followed the release of three new book nook sets earlier this month.How to get the LEGO gift with purchaseLEGO always has a gift with purchase promotion going on and the conditions you'll need to meet to get it tend to vary. These extra sets are only available through the LEGO store and are generally one of the main reasons to buy through LEGO instead of third parties like Amazon. In the case of this Jane Austen set, you'll need to spend at least $150 in qualifying purchases to get the free set. This excludes things like preorders or previous purchases you've already made. This promotion will only be available from now until June 27, but sometimes these will sell out before the expiration date. Once the set is gone, its usually gone for good.$150 may seem like a lot to spend on LEGO, but it's pretty easy to do with just a few purchases. If you're looking to buy just one thing to get the Jane Austen set, though, here are a few options over that $150 mark worth considering. LEGO is also currently running its double points sale for Insiders right now, so it's worth considering signing up for that if you plan on making a bigger purchase.Originally posted: Jun 20, 2025 11:04 pm",
