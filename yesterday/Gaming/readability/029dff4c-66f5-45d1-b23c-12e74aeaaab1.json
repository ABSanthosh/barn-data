  "text": "Attention, Helldivers! The Ministry of Defense Research \u0026 Development team has just declassified the following information for immediate release.  You have been cleared to field test a new range of experimental weapons built from acquired alien technology. R\u0026D scientists have completed the Control Group Premium Warbond* for deployment to your Super Destroyer! Weapons \u0026 Stratagems First up, in the primary weapon category, is the VG-70 Variable, a seven-barrelled volley gun with three different firing modes: Auto, which has three selectable RPM values; Volley, which fires a single shot from each barrel at once; and Total, which fires all remaining ammunition in one go. Researchers noted that using the Total firing mode with a lot of ammunition may result in bodily harm to the user. Also in need of field testing is the new G-31 Arc grenade. The lightweight G-31 bounces while discharging electricity that strikes enemies (and Helldivers) in proximity. The next declassified item is the PLAS-45 Epoch support weapon which charges plasma into a focused sphere which is then fired. This weapon is ready for battlefield use, but additional research data suggests that it can explode if overcharged. No safe mode is available. But we’re sure you can handle it, Helldiver. This is what field testing is all about! ​​Next up in offensive technology is the A/LAS-98 Laser Sentry. For this sentry, the ammunition canisters on standard turrets have been replaced with a supersized heatsink, allowing the potential for infinite laser firing. However, R\u0026D would like to remind users that the turret can overheat and explode if the laser is continuously active with no cooldown. Perhaps the most significant and exciting development from the Ministry of Defense is the new LIFT-182 Warp Pack stratagem. R\u0026D has harnessed the power of Dark Fluid to generate a (somewhat) stable wormhole on demand. Once the wormhole is active, wearers can teleport short distances with no cooldown between jumps. In practice, the wearer is pulled into the singularity, dematerialized, and rematerialized again in a new location.  The head of R\u0026D noted that the dematerialization process can be somewhat painful, and that users should bear in mind that the wormhole cannot maintain integrity for extended periods–each jump will further destabilize it, and the wearer may experience death should the singularity fully collapse. A small price to pay for ultra-convenient traversal! Armors \u0026 more ​​And don’t forget about proper personal protective equipment! Good field testing involves enforcing safety protocols, which is why we’re outfitting Control Group with two new sets of armor designed to provide adequate battlefield protection. For medium armor, we’ve included the AD-26 Bleeding Edge that will allow for protection and greater ease of movement combined. But for more dangerous experiments, there’s also the AD-49 Apollonian heavy armor that’s meant to assist you with the perils of evaluating all this new equipment.  Each armor set looks professionally stylish with the coordinating capes, Conductor of Brilliance and Over Artifice Triumphant, and both armor sets feature a new and exciting passive: Adreno-Defibrillator! After you take lethal damage and the Adreno-Defibrillator detects that the user has collapsed, it activates and revives the user to full health. R\u0026D did indicate that the Adreno-Defibrillator only has enough charge for one use to bring the user to maximum health, and the user will begin losing health continually after activating it. In addition to all this, R\u0026D is including new player cards to match the Conductor of Brilliance and Over Artifice Triumphant capes, and we’re giving you access to a new emote to assist in testing: Protect Eardrums. Covering your ears is the leading method to prevent noise-induced hearing loss. Safety first! And, finally, with great scientific discovery comes much hard work and sacrifice, Helldivers, and that’s why we want to recognize your valiant field testing efforts of the Control Group Warbond with a special title: Exemplary Subject. Wear this to show your squad that you got in on the ground floor of this advanced technology! You’ve been recruited into the Control Group, divers. Report to R\u0026D for field testing on July 17! *Requires base game, paid purchase of Super Credits, and game progression to unlock. Trending Stories",
