This is a more powerful version of the standard PS5 console. Normally you would have to choose between \"Quality mode\" with true 4K graphics and a lower 30fps max framerate or a \"Performance mode\" with upscaled 1440p (or lower) graphics with up to 60fps max framerate. However, thanks to the power of the new PS5 Pro console, you can get native 4K resolution and up to 60fps max framerate in many if not most games. The console retails for $699.99 which is $200 more than the standard PS5 console and doesn't include a disc drive as standard. You'd need to buy an add-on disc drive unit for another $79.99.The PlayStation Days of Play Sale Ends Wednesday, June 11Sony has pulled the trigger on the Days of Play Sale, its annual savings event that drops prices on all things PlayStation.
