  "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What time of the day are you at your best? From 5:30 until about 11 in the morning. Everything is downhill after lunch, which is when I turn into Sleepy Spice, hahaha! I don’t know when it happened, but somewhere along the way in the last 10 years, I became a morning person. 2. Things you like in your smoothie? Greek yogurt, vanilla protein powder, raspberries (for fiber!) are my favorites. I also like bananas or apples for sweetness. 3. Something about your current makeup routine that bugs you? Ugh, the concealer I’ve been using from MAC just doesn’t seal well after I use it. Bits and bobs of it end up all over the place. It’s super messy and it bothers me. 4.

Something about your makeup routine that you love? I’ve pretty much gotten everything so streamlined that I can get an entire face on in less than five minutes. The ability to put on makeup joyfully in very little time has been absolutely freeing. 5. Something beauty-related that you’re thinking about doing? I’m very casually thinking about coloring my hair again. I’m not really serious about it because of the time and the money it takes for upkeep (ugh, ROOTS), but I kindasorta miss the thrill of changing it through highlights and whatnot. I dunno. I probably won’t do it for the sake of practicality, but then again, I just might! Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S.
