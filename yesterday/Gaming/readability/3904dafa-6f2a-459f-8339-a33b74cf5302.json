Which is why, of course, so many… myself included… are at least giving this Kickstarter campaign a bit of a raised eyebrow.  Sure, there is some game there on display for us, but we’ve been fooled before… even by people on the Stars Reach team who participated in faked up demos of EverQuest Next.  I have poor short term memory, but a pretty vindictive long term ability to hold a grudge. Still, I probably need to get over some of those things… plus, I didn’t get burned by buying a backer pack for any of that Landmark stuff… and I am already digressing from the point; the Stars Reach Kickstarter campaign is coming next week. Stars Reach – Looking for your backing I understand the need that Playable Worlds is attempting to fill with this venture.  The video game industry is in a pretty grim place here in 2025. (Here, go read this presentation.  I’ll be referencing it again tomorrow in any case, so you might as well be prepared.)  So investors are feeling shy about any project that cannot demonstrate some serious potential for success.  And one way to do that is to launch a successful Kickstarter campaign in order to convince investors that there are fans falling over themselves to hand the developers money. We’ve been down this path before, Kickstarter as something of a marketing tool.  We’ll no doubt go down it again. But what is Playable Worlds going to give us for our money?  I am kind of a stickler for getting SOMETHING for my dollars.  I wrote a post about two weeks back about what options there might be for a Stars Reach campaign, including things that would please me and things that would irk me.  And now we have an email from the team with a sketch of what will be on offer. Here is what they laid out: Citizen Tier This is our introduction tier where we’ve kept the barrier low for everyone to have a chance to be a part of this game. In addition to upgrade opportunities, the Citizen tier also includes an in-game title, Discord role, and a set of 4k wallpapers from us.  This is probably why I wrote Star Citizen in the initial headline.  This looks to be in the “just give us something” level of effort.  Every campaign has that.  Some little perks. Scout Tier Depending on your level in the Scout Tier, you’ll be able to score unique outfit options, beginner gear that will give you a head start during the early access phase, and a unique pet emote! We wouldn’t be able to do this without you so we’re including your name in the credits as well! Additionally, we’re going to let as many people in from the pre-Alpha signups as possible, but after the Kickstarter finishes, we’re limiting testing to folks that have contributed at the Scout Tier and above. Welp, they’re selling access to the pre-alpha testing.  What did I say about that two weeks ago?  Let me dig that out: Then do they sell access to join the testing? That also seems… not ideal. Being in the test is not always fun. You have seen me kvetch about the need to constantly start over again. And what does that sort of Kickstarter do for me, somebody already in the test? Would they boot me from the test to motivate me to pledge to their campaign in order to get back into the test? Let me tell you up front, that will not make me a bigger fan of the project. I want to be sympathetic… but also this does not feel like value for money… and it is clear if I do not pledge at least at that level I will be asked to leave until general availability, which is the sort of thing to evoke a childish “well, who wants your dumb game anyway” response at first blush. So let’s move on before I write anything too rash. Reacher Tier In addition to all of the levels and gifts in the Citizen and Scout Tiers, those in the Reacher Tier will unlock perks that enhance your gaming experience. Our Reacher Tier unlocks the ability to invite up to four friends to join you in your adventure… or if you’d prefer, you can trade those passes to other players so they can invite their friends instead! We’re also giving you starter sets for the early access phase including highly durable tools, special pets, and even a Grav Mesh which will grant you the power of flight right away! Invite your friends to testing.  That is a thing.  But this does also include some in-game items that will become available during early access if I am reading that correctly… also “early access” confirmed I guess.  Still, the grav mesh is a key item and, while it will likely be easily available once the economy gets going… somebody in a post-test fireside said they expected guilds would be handing them out as recruiting incentives to new players… having it on day one would be a very nice thing indeed. Titan Tier Our Titan Tier is the stand out tier. Some of the perks to be expected here include invitations to the Stars Reach Launch Party, direction on your very own planet, immortalization in the Hall of Heroes, and even a personal 1:1 with Raph Koster himself. If you’ve ever wanted to meet and collaborate with the developers on a video game, this is your chance! You have to have a limited whale tier to… well… skin the whales I guess.  I will not be contributing at this level.  Even had I the financial security to throw money around like this will no doubt require, I wouldn’t even know what to do with the ability to guide the development of my own planet. And that is what we’ve got, the sort of thing that gets me to let out a big sigh. I guess, absent the actual dollar amounts that each of these tiers will run, the Reacher tier would be my pick, that being the one that seems to offer some level of value for ones pledge. But now we’re down to haggling over price.   If they run this like a serious campaign, if they’re got somebody who knows what they’re doing, there will be limited availability discount versions of all but the base tier pledge, plus addons and bonuses and stretch goals and the myriad things that you can do in order to make the whole thing induce FOMO and pressure to buy in early while there is an advantage.  The email makes it clear that they’re planning on all of that sort of thing. They are doing so because they will want people in a rush to pledge, because any campaign that isn’t close to 50% funded in its first 24 hours is at risk failing to hit its goal because the campaign either doesn’t have the backers it thought it did, or it hasn’t done the groundwork to get its fan base engaged and ready to go when the campaign kicks off.  Nobody who knows what they’re doing launches a surprise Kickstarter campaign. We have yet to see what the campaign goal will be or what the pricing on any of the tiers, though I suspect that the base Citizen tier will be a $10 pledge.  We shall see.  The actual pricing will obviously affect my level of enthusiasm. The one thing the email message did say was there was just a week left before the campaign commenced, so it seems like Monday, February 10th will be the day.  And if that is so I expect that we will see Raph out doing the interview tour this week with all the usual suspects he and the team can round up. I will be keeping an eye on that and will link any I find below, but I’ll start with the Kickstarter campaign itself.
