  "text": "As I noted on Friday, our staging system in Scalding Pass put us within range of a few systems in Insmother, the region that is the target of the campaign, but that we would likely be moving forward soon.  And, as it turned out, sooner than I thought, though not to one of the systems I had indicated.  But we have a new staging Keepstar The next step in the deployment is X2-ZA5 The Saturday 19:00 coalition fireside announced that we would be moving to a new Keepstar that was coming online even as Asher was speaking to us.  Also, the fireside had to be simulcast on Twitch because Mumble is starting to crack again under the weight of our enthusiasm. This time there was no attempt to interdict or blow the structure up before it went online.  It was suggested that Pandemic Horde might not have even noticed the Keepstar being setup this time around.  This was because we did not advance into Insmother, but moved to a system closer to Insmother in Scalding Pass. The move within Scalding Pass However, unlike the range between some regions, where the regional gates between places like Catch and Querious span a distance further than caps can jump, Scalding Pass and Insmother are fairly close together.  The distance between X2-ZAA5 and GK5Z-T in Insmother is just 2.734 light years. In fact, staging in X2 for now puts 41 of the 110 systems in Insmother within range of supers and titans, the ships with the shortest jump distance.  That goes up to 50 systems with dreads, carriers, and faxes.  So we will be able to project into Insmother even if we’re not staged in the region yet. Immediately after the fireside fleets went up and those of us who brought capital ships to haul our subcaps around packed them all up and undocked to jump to the new Keepstar.  That was enough to push the system to 100% tidi. Leaving the N2 Keepstar en masse At the far end of the jump we landed on a freshly online Keepstar.  Services were just being put online and no paint had yet been applied.  (The red SKIN came about 20 minutes later.) Landing on a new Keepstar As soon as I had jumped both my capitals… in a rare moment of foresight for me I realized I had already managed to get more subcaps in our stager than I could fit in my hangar, so I had my main combat alt fly out in my 2012 vintage Archon to carry the excess… and also bring out an additional ship… there was a ping to remind us not to forget our implant clones.  That showed up just as my alt was mid-jump. Now you tell me… Fortunately I had a jump clone back at the old staging… well, of course I did, it was my doctrine implant clone… so I jumped back, grabbed a shuttle, then flew forward to the new Keepstar.  Fortunately there were subcap moves going on so the route was clear and my shuttle arrived safely. The white star in system and the bright red of that keepstar combine to blot out the stars As we settled into our new staging structure, a ping went out.  We had things to do already.  I joined up with the Raven Navy fleet… which just happened to be the doctrine my implant clone was for… but opted to roll out in a Basilisk.  There was a call for more logi at the fireside and I had brought along my Basi, so I went with that.  (Also, being the last day of the month, I had already gotten on my required kill mails… but with June’s arrival I’ll need to fly DPS until I get that month’s kill mail.)  Off we went. We bridged out to EFM-C4, one of the systems in Insmother now within range of our new staging Keepstar, where we anchored a Fortizar.  We covered that timer and shot their Ansiblex for good measure, even as they were announcing that their cover fleet was in place and it was time to start ratting. Ravens moving around PH space EFM-C4 is an interesting system in that it has a gate… a long distance regional gate… to Etherium Reach, which is a core PanFam home region.  Flood plains end and real space starts on the other side of that gate.  We now have to wait six days for the Fortizar to come online, the penalty for dropping it in space that somebody else owns.  But once it is online it will be a point we can safely bridge to and operate from. The other thing about that Fortizar is that it is on grid with a PanFam Keepstar, so expect that to be a fight. After covering that we flew the six jumps back to our new staging.  Even without a bridge it is very close for subcaps.  Now to see how the war develops from this new position.",

Basilisk.  There was a call for more logi at the fireside and I had brought along my Basi, so I went with that.  (Also, being the last day of the month, I had already gotten on my required kill mails…

Etherium Reach, which is a core PanFam home region.  Flood plains end and real space starts on the other side of that gate.  We now have to wait six days for the Fortizar to come online, the penalty for dropping it in space that somebody else owns.  But once it is online it will be a point we can safely bridge to and operate from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other thing about that Fortizar is that it is on grid with a PanFam Keepstar, so expect that to be a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter covering that we flew the six jumps back to our new staging.  Even without a bridge it is very close for subcaps.  Now to see how the war develops from this new position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
