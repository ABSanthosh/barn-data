  "text": "Image credit: Sega Cast your mind back to the distant days of last December, and you might remember Sega unveiling Project Century, a curious new venture from Yakuza developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio. Well, it's not been given a proper name alongside a new trailer. Project Century's initial showing was eye-catching but not entirely informative, revealing it to be a Yakuza-style third-person action game with real-time combat set in an open city located somewhere in 1915. And honestly, its latest appearance isn't a whole lot more illuminating. But! We've shifted to 1943 this time around, perhaps suggesting the game - just like its codename implies - does indeed unfold across the course of 100 years. Aside from that curiosity, we get an extremely evocative new trailer, featuring some era-appropriate music, a whole lot of fisticuffs, and more of that lovely warm art style. More crucially though, Sega has jettisoned the Project Century moniker in favour of its final title, Stranger Than Heaven. STRANGER THAN HEAVEN - Title Reveal Teaser Trailer Stranger Than Heaven title reveal trailer.Watch on YouTube But, unfortunately, that's your lot. There's no hint of a release date, or even the platforms Stranger Than Heaven might be coming to, so for now about all we can do is soak up the ambience of its new trailer and patiently wait to learn more.",
