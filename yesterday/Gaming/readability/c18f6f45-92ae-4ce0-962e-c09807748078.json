  "text": "Image credit: Nintendo We should all know by now that Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Cons feature a mouse sensor, but we've also just learned that Nintendo's new system will also support USB mice, too. As shared in a video by Koei Tecmo, and transcribed by VGC, Nobunaga’s Ambition: Awakening Complete Edition producer Michi Ryu showed off how a mouse can be used on the new system, demonstrating the feature by using both the built-in mouse and a USB one plugged into the console. You can watch it for yourself in the video below: NOBUNAGA’S AMBITION: Awakening CE - Nintendo Switch 2 Gameplay NOBUNAGA’S AMBITION: Awakening CE - Nintendo Switch 2 Gameplay.Watch on YouTube \"The functionality is the same as the already released Steam version, allowing for left click, right click and wheel operations,\" Ryu said as he moved the Joy-Con's analogue stick up and down, as though wheeling a mouse scroll button. He also illustrated how the left Joy-Con 2 can also be used at the same time to access shortcuts. Interestingly, Ryu then showed the same functionality using the same left Joy-Con 2 shortcuts, but by using a USB mouse instead. Each time he changed input devices, there was a message on the screen confirming the change. On its debut, the Switch 2's GameChat will include text-to-speech and live captions. Nintendo will also be able to record video and voice chats stored on your console for a limited time, if you give consent. This is to ensure a \"safe and family-friendly online environment\", Nintendo said, with footage only reviewed as part of its user-report system. Those wanting to utilise the Switch 2's GameChat feature will need to register a phone number. The Nintendo Switch 2 will be available worldwide in just under two weeks time, on 5th June.
