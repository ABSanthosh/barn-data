For a limited time, you can pick up the new Apple iPad Pro 13\" M4 tablet for $1051.16 shipped on Amazon. Alternatively, you can get the exact same model for about $20 cheaper from Walmart via Adorama (an authorized Apple reseller). The latest iPad Pro was released on May 15, 2024 and boasts significant upgrades over its predecessor including a powerful M4 chip and a gorgeous tandem OLED display.Apple iPad Pro 13\" M4 256GB Tablet From $131.74Apple iPad Pro 13-Inch (M4) 256GBApple iPad Pro 13-Inch (M4) 256GBThe 2024 iPad Pro is the best tablet on the market, iOS or otherwise, thanks to the new M4 processor, which is both powerful and power-efficient. Compared to the previous generation, iPad M2, it performs about 20% better.However, the biggest update of the iPad Pro is not the M4 chip, but instead the tandem OLED panel which hadn't previously been seen on an Apple product. Tandem OLED is better than traditional OLED in two ways: 1) it's far brighter, and 2) it's less prone to burn-in. If you're wondering why this technology hasn't found its way into TVs, the answer is simply because it's not cost-effective at larger sizes. The iPad can get away with it because the 11\" screen is much smaller, but that's also a major reason why the iPad Pro is priced considerably higher than the other iPads in Apple's 2024 lineup.More iPads are discounted for Mother's DayMother's Day lands on Sunday, May 11, which means that there's still (barely) time to order a gift and have it delivered by this weekend. And what better Mother's Day gift than a brand new iPad? Fortunately, Amazon has dropped the price of several of the latest iPad models, including the 11th-gen Apple iPad (A16), the 7th-gen iPad Air, and the iPad Mini (A17 Pro). These are the lowest prices we've seen and either match or beat the best deals we saw during Black Friday.Looking for more iPad resources?If you're not sure which iPad is best for you, we have a best iPad guide which details which iPad model is ideal for which use case. If you intend to get an iPad for schoolwork, we have the best iPad for students as well.
