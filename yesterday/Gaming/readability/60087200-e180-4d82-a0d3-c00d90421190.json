  "text": "Image credit: IO Interactive IO Interactive has confirmed it is \"addressing\" Hitman: World of Assassination issues on Nintendo Switch 2. While no specific time scales were provided for when players can expect an improvement to the Switch 2 launch title, the team is reportedly \"working on some of those performance issues right now\" and continue to do so \"over the summer\". Let's Play Hitman 3 Ambrose Island DLC Gameplay - AGENT 32 IS BACK AND READY FOR CHAOS! Ian plays Hitman.Watch on YouTube “So for Hitman, the team is working on some of those performance issues right now, and they are addressing it over the summer,” franchise director Jonathan Lacaille told VGC. “It's, of course, good learning for us to bring to First Light as well – so all of this will be learnings we bring to the next title.\" While the news may not contain a specific timeframe or much detail, it should be good news nonetheless for those struggling to play the game on Nintendo's latest handheld. Some are reporting issues with interactionable objects, opening doors, and crashing, while others complain of \"horrible\" frame dips and stuttering. ICYMI, developer IO Interactive is developing a co-op mode for Hitman: World of Assassination. Announced last month, the mode is still relatively under wraps, but does feature two names you may recognise: Stone and Knight. These two popped up in the Hitman Sniper mode. On this co-op mode's release, players will be able to pop into \"exciting missions\" from the Hitman world with their pal by their side, \"challenging\" how players approach things now they are going in as one of a pair.",
