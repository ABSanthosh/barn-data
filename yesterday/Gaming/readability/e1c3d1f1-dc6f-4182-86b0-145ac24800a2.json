  "description": "The new Citadelle des Morts Zombies map is live in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 with Season 1 Reloaded. This new map includes a full main storyline quest, but it also contains a hidden story cutscene that can only be unlocked by playing as Maya. Here's everything you need to know to experience this hidden cutscene for yourself. Naturally, this guide contains spoilers.Citadelle des Morts is a castle in France, and the Zombies storyline here picks up after the ending of the main story quest for Terminus. This is also an exciting narrative for Zombies fans, as the events of Terminus and Citadelle des Morts merge storylines from Treyarch's previously unconnected Zombies storylines. How to unlock Maya's secret cutsceneThe main prerequisite to unlock this secret is playing Citadelle des Morts as Maya. Follow the in-game prompts that will walk you through the first few steps of the map, leading you to the Pack-a-Punch room. The first step of this Easter egg can't be triggered until after round 11. Keep a zombie alive at the end of round 12 or higher, and then go to the Dining Hall, which is the same room with the Vulture Aid perk. Head upstairs by the Vulture Aid machine, and you'll find a wooden door in the left corner. There's also a table with a radio beside it. Interact with the radio first, and you'll hear a man named Franco speaking to you. He'll unlock the door, letting you enter inside a secret room that's otherwise inaccessible. Once through the door, you'll be inside a very cramped passageway. You'll be swarmed with Vermin enemies if you rush though, so it's best to hang back and take them out first. From there, enter a room with the map's new special enemy type called the Doppelghast. Kill the first one before progressing. Then, you'll run into an elite version of the Doppelghast named Laurent. Kill him to pick up a key. This will let you unlock the door to where Franco is hiding and receive Maya's hidden cutscene. Maya's cutscene explainedMajor spoilers ahead: Maya is introduced as a brand-new character in Zombies. She arrives at Terminus with the hopes of finding her brother Nathan. However, we learn during the events of the Terminus story quest that Nathan has been experimented on by scientists working with Richtofen as part of Project Janus. Sadly, Maya has to kill the mutated mini-boss that was once her brother.In the cutscene, Maya kills Franco. This is part of her revenge tour against the people who hurt her brother, as he was the man working with the French Syndicate who sold her brother to Project Janus and is still working with Richtofen.Additionally, Season 1 Reloaded includes the holiday-themed Merry Mayhem event. The event rewards include the season's new Maelstrom shotgun, a multiplayer perk, and weapon attachment. It also includes the new Light Bend ammo mod and Tesla Storm field upgrade specifically for Zombies, and you might want to consider unlocking them for use on Citadelle des Morts.",
