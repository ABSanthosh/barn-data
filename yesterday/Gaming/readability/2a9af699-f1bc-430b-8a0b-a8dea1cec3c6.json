For a limited time, Cowboy Bebop: The Complete Series on Blu-ray is available for only $18 (was $60). Alternatively, you can save nearly 50% on last year's 25th Anniversary Special Edition, which includes a small amount of additional content.Cowboy Bebop is one of two classic anime cited by Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann as an inspiration for the studio's upcoming game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which was revealed at The Game Awards. The other anime Druckmann mentioned was Akira, the 1988 cult-classic film adapted from Katsuhiro Otomo's legendary manga. You can save on Akira's 4K Blu-ray ($18), 1080p Blu-ray ($11.49), and 35th Anniversary Manga Box Set ($131) at Amazon. You can learn more about Akira and Cowboy Bebop below. For more on Intergalactic, check out our breakdown of everything we know about Naughty Dog's next game. Cowboy Bebop: The Complete Series (Blu-ray) $18 (was $60) Cowboy Bebop: The Complete Series features all 26 episodes across four discs. This remastered edition retains the original 4:3 aspect ratio, but with a high-definition resolution bump. It contains English voiceover dubs as well as the original Japanese audio track with subtitles. Along with all of the episodes, you'll get a bunch of bonus features, including five audio commentaries, various featurettes, multiple interviews, and more.Amazon's deal on Funimation's 2014 release, which drops the price to $18, is the best we've seen this year.Amazon also has the 25th Anniversary Special Edition on sale for $27.49 (was $50). Released by Crunchyroll last year, this edition is largely the same as the $18 version, except it comes with a fifth disc containing a 25-year retrospective and an interview with Koichi Yamadera (voice actor of Spike) recorded for the series 20th anniversary.Cowboy Bebop takes place five decades after Earth became uninhabitable. In 2071, many humans live on moons and other planets in the galaxy. Just like the main character in Intergalactic, Cowboy Bebop follows a bounty hunter. Spike Spiegel is the leader of a group of bounty hunters (cowboys) who travel the galaxy on a interplanetary fishing trawler (the Bebop) picking up contracts for bounties on criminals.Though it deals with some serious topics, Cowboy Bebop is also often funny and heartfelt. The ragtag group of bounty hunters who join the Bebop are well-developed characters that you really feel for throughout the show's 26 episodes. Plus, Cowboy Bebop has a very good and extremely intelligent pup named Ein (a space corgi). See at Amazon See 25th Anniversary Edition Akira on 4K Blu-ray $18.44 (was $30) | $11.49 on 1080p Blu-ray Akira is available on 4K Blu-ray for $18.44 (was $30) at Amazon. This version of Akira's 4K remaster released in 2022. It also comes with a standard Blu-ray disc with previously released bonus content, including storyboard collections, original trailers and commercials, featurettes on restoring the film, and more. In total, you're getting over two hours of bonus content.If you don't have a 4K media player or want to save some additional cash, Akira's 1080p Blu-ray and DVD combo pack is up for grabs for only $11.49 (was $35). This edition was released for the anime's 25th anniversary in 2013. The Blu-ray disc contains the film and the two-plus hours of bonus content.First released in 1988, Akira remains one of the most beloved anime films to this day. The alternate-history film takes place in Neo-Tokyo in 2019, 31 years after World War 3 was brought on by the destruction of Tokyo. The futuristic metropolis is now rife with seedy characters and rival gangs vying for territory and power. The story follows Shotaro Kaneda, the leader of a biker gang, and his friend Tetsuo Shima, who possesses psychic abilities that, in the wrong hands, can lead to destruction and ruin.Akira's plot is not the easiest to follow, and it's not always readily apparent who is good and who is bad. The movie is also quite different and drastically condensed, understandably, compared to the original manga by Katushiro Otomo. It released before Otomo's manga even ended and only covers roughly the first third of the story.

The futuristic metropolis is now rife with seedy characters and rival gangs vying for territory and power.
