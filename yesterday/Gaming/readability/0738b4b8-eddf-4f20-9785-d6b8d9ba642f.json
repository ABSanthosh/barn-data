  "text": "February 18, 2025 by Call of Duty Staff Season 02 Reloaded brings an incredible new collaboration to the forefront with Call of Duty x Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, plus two Multiplayer maps, six new weapons, Directed Mode for The Tomb, and more. Get ready for turtle power when the mid-season update launches on February 20! Season 02 Reloaded: Incoming Intel The Fight Continues Sev and Rogue Team remain on the run, evading capture while fighting back when the opportunity strikes. In the ongoing game of cat and mouse, the hunt continues. The mid-season update for Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6 sets the stakes even higher with new maps, new weapons and attachments, Perks, and more, including an awesome seasonal collaboration featuring everyone’s favorite heroes in a half-shell. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 02 Reloaded arrives on Thursday, February 20 at 9AM PT across all platforms. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6: Season 02 Reloaded Two Maps: Catch some air and battle around ramps and rails as Grind Ooze arrives in a special variant of the fan-favorite skatepark. Take the fight to a speeding train in the Bullet Strike map, battling within its narrow carriages and up top in the whistling wind. TMNT Moshpit: Experience a radical new limited-time Moshpit as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles bring their elite combat abilities to Multiplayer. New Loadout Content: Mark your next target for elimination with the Hunter’s Instinct Perk and be prepared for any and all aerial threats using the new Flyswatter Wildcard. Multiplayer Maps Grind Ooze Remaster, Core, 6v6, Medium-Sized The fan-favorite map first released in Call of Duty: Black Ops II returns for Black Ops 6 in the mid-season! Show off your best combat moves in the outdoor Half Pipe and Cradle or take your chances inside as Operators trade shots around the Store and across the indoor skate ramps, with TMNT decals, posters, and artwork spread across the scenery. Bullet Brand-New, Strike, 6v6/2v2, Small-Sized Sev and Rogue Team deploy to a high-speed bullet train to neutralize a key enemy target. Keep your eyes sharp when moving up and sweeping the carriages; the automatic sliding doors may reveal an incoming enemy at a moment’s notice. Climb up to the roof of the train to feel the whipping wind and marvel at the landscape flying by. Be ready to defend your spot up top and then drop back down behind the enemy line. Turtle Power! New TMNT-themed Limited Time Mode The Ninja Turtles have arrived in Call of Duty and are kicking things off with a limited time Moshpit giving everyone the chance to let loose with their best TMNT-themed abilities and moves. TMNT Moshpit Enter a game of Team Deathmatch, Domination, or Hardpoint and unleash ninja-level abilities and TMNT Scorestreaks against your enemies in pursuit of victory. These special Scorestreaks are earned by scoring as normal, but because the turtles work as a team, objective plays award an increase in the score. Activating your special Scorestreak gives you the following benefits: General Abilities For 30 seconds, gain increased health plus fast health regen and increased movement speed and melee range. A HUD indicator will flash when an enemy is outside your view and being shot while running toward an enemy will not slow you down. You can perform Finishing Moves on enemies from any direction. Plus, gain the ability to Double Jump and Air Dash. Turtle Powers Using your TMNT Scorestreak also activates one of several different character-specific abilities. One of these abilities is assigned randomly to players at the start of the match. Those deploying with a TMNT Operator, however, will get access to that character’s specific Scorestreak. The abilities include: Splinter: Vanish in smoke and teleport to a safe location behind enemy lines. Leonardo: Gain the Tracker, Ghost, Vigilance, and Cold-Blooded Perks to navigate the map in stealth. Donatello: See Operators through walls as well as Equipment, Field Upgrades, and Scorestreaks. Hack enemy Equipment and Field Upgrades. Michelangelo: Drops a Pizza Box for your team. Players who eat a slice will deal Double Damage for a short time. Replenishes ammo and Equipment. Raphael: Unlimited Shuriken. New Loadout Content Mark the next target for elimination and swap your Dedicated Melee for a Launcher with two new Loadout items expanding your options in the field. New Perk Perk: Hunter’s Instinct Perk Slot: 2 Type: Enforcer (Red) Available: Season 02 Reloaded Reward Eliminating an enemy will mark the next closest one. A narrow cone briefly appears on your mini-map after an elimination, showing the general direction of your next nearest foe. New Wildcard Wildcard: Flyswatter Available: Season 02 Reloaded Reward Allows a player to replace their Dedicated Melee weapon with a Launcher. Zombies: Season 02 Reloaded Content Cowabunga Cranked: Kick undead butt and don’t let up as the timer keeps ticking down in this TMNT Zombies LTM, challenging players to take down target after target to beat the clock and stay alive. The Tomb – Directed Mode: Directed Mode arrives for The Tomb, granting players extra guidance and round cap limitations when taking on the Main Quest. Rage like Raph in TMNT Cranked There’s nothing like a train of undead targets to test the turtles’ fighting prowess. It’s time to go loud in this new limited-time Cranked variant, testing players with a timer that left unchecked will count down to their own destruction. Here’s how this plays out: Cowabunga Cranked Add some high-octane urgency to any of the four Zombies maps and your undead horde slaying in Cowabunga Cranked. Drop into Terminus, Liberty Falls, Citadelle des Morts, or The Tomb with your Loadout of choice and eliminate a zombie to trigger the Cranked timer. Fail to eliminate a zombie before the timer hits zero and ka-boom! You’re gone. As rounds progress, the Cranked timer will continue to shrink, so keep pushing the fight to stay in the game! Thankfully, there are several Pizza power-ups that can drop in the match, including: Turtle Power: Temporarily empowers the player with a health bonus and Pack-A-Punch 3 Legendary Melee Weapons Pizza Box: Fills the Cranked Timer to max Slice-O-Pie: Partial time added to the Cranked Timer Plus, all players in this mode are given the Donny’s Time Stopper Field Upgrade; activate it to pause the Cranked timer for one full minute! Deploy as a Ninja Turtle Operator to gain 50% reduced damage from behind; join as Splinter for a slightly increased chance for a Slice-O-Pie to drop from eliminated enemies. For those craving a real challenge, Main Quests will be active in Cowabunga Cranked, with a subtly different TMNT version of each map’s Main Quest completion Calling Card available as a memento for anyone radical enough to achieve this feat! Think you can finish all of them? The Tomb: Directed Mode Season 02 Reloaded brings Directed Mode for The Tomb. Explore the cursed catacombs and teleport to a world of chaos through the Doorway to Nowhere. In Directed Mode, players can take on the Main Quest with added guidance and a maximum round cap of 15. Start at the Dig Site and descend into the tombs, unearthing ancient burial sites and shrines along with the new Shock Mimic enemy, the Arrow Trap, and the legendary Staff of Ice Wonder Weapon. If you haven’t yet experienced the full Main Quest — or if you’re itching to play it through again with some added help — this is your chance to discover the newest shocking revelations, as Weaver, Maya, Carver, and Grey seek out the Sentinel Artifact in hopes of freeing Samantha Maxis from her Dark Aether imprisonment. Call of Duty: Warzone: Season 02 Reloaded Content Season 02 Reloaded: We’re continuing to prioritize gameplay tuning, quality of life improvements, and more throughout the mid-season as players deploy across Urzikstan, Area 99, and Rebirth Island. New Perk: Stay low and keep on the move with the new Low Profile Perk, improving your movement speed when crouched, prone, and downed. Call of Duty: Warzone Updates As stated in our Season 02 launch article, our main focus in Call of Duty: Warzone is prioritizing gameplay tuning by addressing quality of life improvements, ongoing bugs, and more. Consult the consistently updated Patch Notes for further information. Overview and Features Players will continue duking it out in Battle Royale, Resurgence, and Plunder across Urzikstan, Area 99, and Rebirth Island, and Ranked Play across Urzikstan. XP earned within Call of Duty: Warzone will also contribute toward ongoing Events including the Call of Duty x Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Clover Craze Events, detailed later in this blog. New Perk Perk: Low Profile Perk Slot: 1 Available: Season 02 Reloaded Reward Move more quickly while crouched and prone. Enemies you kill will not have death markers for their allies.
