  "text": "April 29, 2025 by Call of Duty Staff Season 03 Reloaded brings two new Multiplayer maps, Directed Mode for Shattered Veil, and new updates to Verdansk. Get new Loadout items like the Vendetta Perk and the Ladra SMG and participate in new events and more when the mid-season update launches on May 1! Season 03 Reloaded: Incoming Intel The Mystery Deepens The global search for the Pantheon moles accelerates as Operators revisit new territories revealed in the video Hudson recorded before his death.     Prepare for a wealth of new content in the mid-season update coming to Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone™, bringing new maps, modes, events, Loadout items, and more, including new features on Verdansk like a moving train and High Value Loot Zones. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 03 Reloaded arrives on Thursday, May 1 at 9AM PT across all platforms. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6: Season 03 Reloaded Two New Maps: Travel to an estate turned KGB safehouse in the mid-sized Haven, seeking out targets across the sprawling grounds and lavish interiors. In the new Signal Strike map, revisit the infamous Numbers Station as Operators battle above and below the water. Join Operations LTM: Test your endurance in a new multi-mode LTM complete with special breaks that introduce gameplay modifiers to every Operator in the field. New Perk: Seek out the enemy who eliminated you with the new Vendetta Perk, marking them out for elimination. Multiplayer Maps Haven Brand-New, Core, 6v6, Medium-Sized Head to a KBG safehouse established in a neglected estate, its aesthetics forgotten in favor of its usefulness as a base of operations. Fight for control of the command center built up in the old Ballroom and view an impressive array of armaments brought into the Hall. Reams of cable connect running generators and supplies at the Entrance promise an extended stay. Signal Brand-New, Strike, 6v6/2v2, Small-Sized Turn the clock back to 1968 when Pantheon moles infiltrated the Numbers Station, where water floods in through a breach in the walls and flames lap the upper walkways. Engage enemies in the central Broadcast center or fight through the flashing lights and alarms of the Control room. When things get heated, drop into the water below and swim behind enemy lines. Joint Operations Limited Time Mode Ride to victory in a blaze of glory in Joint Operations, a gauntlet that challenges players across a series of Multiplayer mode variants including Team Deathmatch, Domination, Hardpoint, Kill Order, and Kill Confirmed. Catch your breath during breaks throughout the match, shifting the play of the game by adding modifiers that effect every Operator, including a +420 Score Bonus, 3rd Person, Visual Impairment, Double Health, Hardcore, Paranoia Sounds, Low Gravity, Double Jump, and Increased Movement Speed. Battle in 6v6 across all five modes, their order randomized at the start of each match. Compete for two minutes in each mode, ending when one team reaches the Score Limit or at the conclusion of all five modes. The team with the most points wins the game. New Loadout Content Seek vengeance on the Operator who eliminated you with a new Multiplayer Perk that encourages payback. New Perk Perk: Vendetta Perk Slot: 2 Type: Recon (Blue) Available: Season 03 Reloaded Blaze of Glory Event Reward On respawn, mark your killer’s last known position for a short duration. Get a bonus score for eliminating that enemy. The Vigilance Perk counters being marked by Vendetta. Zombies: Season 03 Reloaded Content  Zombie Snacks LTM: Reach a flow state in the new Zombies Snacks limited-time mode, replacing your Operator’s health with an energy meter and granting special abilities to those who get in the flow. Returning Field Upgrade: Freeze the undead in their tracks with the Frost Blast Field Upgrade, complete with researchable Major and Minor Augments that further empower the blizzard attack. Shattered Veil – Directed Mode: Directed Mode arrives for Shattered Veil, providing round cap limitations and extra guidance when tackling the Main Quest. Get in the Flow in Zombie Snacks Whet your appetite in the Zombie Snacks limited-time mode, challenging Operators to keep their energy reserves up while aiming to enter a flow state, providing extra power for slaying the undead. Play Zombie Snacks on all five maps, including Shattered Veil, The Tomb, Citadelle des Morts, Terminus, and Liberty Falls, in both Standard and Directed playlists with the following gameplay changes: Energy Meter: In Zombie Snacks, your Operator’s health bar is replaced with an energy meter which depletes when taking damage or moving. The energy meter does not passively recharge. For that, you need food. In Standard, your energy depletes when moving or taking damage.  Jumping, mantling, sliding, and diving all deplete energy on use. In Directed Mode, your energy only depletes when taking damage. Replenish your energy by eating snacks (+50), drinking Perks (+150), or chewing a GobbleGum (+50).  Other health-based features will also refill energy, such as the Stimshot (+50) and the Light Mend Ammo Mod (+5 per glyph, +10 with the Extra Strength Augment).  The Jugger-Nog Perk will increase your total energy bar. Food Items: Eat food to partially replenish your energy meter, dropped by downed enemies and found throughout the map.  Specials, Elites, and HVTs are guaranteed to drop three snack items. Refrigerator Powerup: When activated, all eliminated zombies will drop food items for a short period of time. Nobody’s going hungry when this Power-Up drops. Flow Mode: Eliminate 10 zombies without taking damage to enter a flow state. Operators in the flow inflict plenty of extra damage and gain special boosts, such as improved handling and movement. Take any damage, and the flow state is lost. We suggest you turn up your music for this one. Earn GobbleGum rewards upon the first completion of the Main Quest in Standard or Directed Mode on any map: Directed: A custom collection of 4 GobbleGums per map. Each contains one high-rarity GobbleGum and 3 GobbleGums of other rarities. 15,000 XP per map, for a total of 75,000 XP across all maps. Standard: A custom collection of 6 GobbleGums per map. Each contains one high-rarity GobbleGum and 5 GobbleGums of other rarities.  15,000 XP per map, for a total of 75,000 XP across all maps. New Gameplay Content The Frost Blast Field Upgrade returns for Black Ops 6! Create a cyclone in front of your Operator and chill enemies to their bones. Additional Field Upgrade: Frost Blast Available: In-Season Blaze of Glory Event Reward Create a blizzard that deals lethal frost damage on activation and slows enemies that enter it. This Field Upgrade can be used in all five Zombies maps along with the previously accessible Field Upgrades, assuming it is chosen as part of your Loadout, or swapped via the menu during a game. Frost Blast: Major Augments Research the following Augments to further customize the Field Upgrade. Ice Slick Enemies within the blizzard may be knocked down. Frost Cast The blizzard moves forward when activated. Flash Freeze Normal enemies within the blizzard will be frozen solid and are killed when damaged. Frost Blast: Minor Augments Extension Significantly increases blizzard duration. Frostbite Increase damage to frozen enemies. Extra Charge Increase max charges by one. Shattered Veil: Directed Mode Get some extra guidance when taking on the Main Quest in Shattered Veil with the arrival of Directed Mode in Season 03 Reloaded. Head to Colton Hall in the wooded hills above Liberty Falls and deliver the Sentinel Artifact to S.A.M. with a maximum round cap of 15. Battle the Elder Disciple and its empowered minions, and keep your ears peeled for Toxic Zombies, which screech as they rush your position and explode, leaving a damaging pool of acid in their wake. Fight back with the upgraded Ray Gun Mark II and burst enemies apart with the Microwave Trap. In the halls and grounds of this old mansion, the team will need every advantage they can get. Ray Gun Mark II Comes to All Maps Ever wanted to wield the Ray Gun Mark II as an additional Wonder Weapon on Liberty Falls, or maybe Citadelle des Morts? With Season 03 Reloaded, now you can. Treyarch is adding the base version of the Ray Gun Mark II to the Mystery Box on all existing Zombies maps to expand your arsenal even further.
