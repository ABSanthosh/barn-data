  "text": "Explore a wild and unrelenting new frontier when Monster Hunter Wilds releases on February 28 on PS5. We recently got to play through the main missions of Chapter 1, going up against colossal enemies including the new monster Quematrice and exploring the Scarlet Forest. Weapons now come with built-in Equipment Skills In previous series’ entries, various hunt-aiding skills were primarily granted through armor, talismans, and decorations, which you combined to create your build. However, in Monster Hunter Wilds, even weapons available early in the game come with built-in Equipment Skills tailored to the weapon type. For example, the Great Sword Buster Sword I features Critical Draw, while Bone Blade II offers Focus and Attack Boost. Since this game allows you to switch between two weapons during a hunt, it’s easier to leverage different skill combinations if you bring both a melee and a ranged weapon. Face off against the Brute Wyvern, Quematrice, and its fiery attacks The hunter, after escorting the siblings, encounters the Brute Wyvern, Quematrice. This monster is a new addition to Monster Hunter Wilds. They take bites at the hunter once provoked, and also spread a flammable substance ignited by dragging their long tail along the ground. Getting hit by this attack leaves the hunter in a Fireblight state, which causes health to gradually deplete over time. As part of the first main mission, the huntert learns to deal with this ailment by utilizing Nulberries or evading tactfully. Seamlessly transition from the Windward Plains to the Scarlet Forest Later in the quest, the hunters head to the Scarlet Forest to investigate Doshagumas. I was amazed that I could ride my Seikret all the way from the plains to the forest without traveling back to base. The area transition was seamless with no loading screens, and it shows you how truly vast and connected the ecosystems are in this game. The Scarlet Forest is characterized by its towering trees and peculiar red-colored water. Its landscape is entirely different from the sandy deserts and rocky formations of the Windward Plains, offering a refreshing change of scenery. Along the way, I came across creatures not found in the Windward Plains, as well as a hideout inhabited by a Lynian tribe called Wudwuds. I’m particularly excited to explore more of the Scarlet Forest when the game launches. Beware of the Lala Barina with its scarlet silk and dominating attacks The first large monster you’ll encounter in the Scarlet Forest is the Temnoceran, Lala Barina. This monster strikes from anywhere – from the trees while hanging by its thread, or from the air ready to ambush. When it shoots out red spores to attack, it opens its thorax to reveal tufts of scarlet hair that resemble a blooming rose. I managed to evade all the spore attacks but getting hit carries the risk of inflicting Paralysis. A thrilling hunt with the Congalala The next monster I encountered in the Scarlet Forest was the Pink Fur Beast, Congalala. While absent from Monster Hunter World, this fanged beast appeared in several past entries in the series. Its defining traits include its pink fur and of course, the foul fart attacks that can inflict Stench status. In addition to its flatulence, Congalala unleashes powerful belches, making its arsenal of Stench-inflicting moves particularly troublesome. It’s a good idea to bring plenty of Deodorants with you to remove the Stench during battle. Its swift arm strikes, delivered with surprising agility for such a large creature, also pack a punch. On top of that, it sometimes retreats into a group of smaller Congas and attacks as a pack. A deadly struggle against Scarlet Forest’s apex predator, Uth Duna Chapter 1 concludes with the hunt for the Uth Duna, a Leviathan that rules the Scarlet Forest as the apex predator. This monster frequently employs water-based attacks that inflict Waterblight, making stamina recovery more difficult. Its most spectacular move is a devastating body slam after soaring into the air, not only dealing massive damage but also toppling large trees in its path. When the Uth Duna unleashes this attack, it’s best to focus entirely on evasion. Uth Duna is a formidable foe, but thankfully, Olivia, a member of the Forbidden Lands Expedition Team, provides support during this mission. With Uth Duna’s attention divided, it becomes easier to launch attacks from the sides or rear. However, Uth Duna also exhibits a unique behavior: it secretes bodily fluids that mix with water to form a protective veil around itself and alters its appearance. While in this state, the veil reduces the damage from the hunter’s attacks, so focus on targeting areas without the veil protection. Utilizing Focus Mode to target vulnerable spots will be the key to success. My playthrough this time focused on the main missions in Chapter 1, but I cannot wait to gather materials through optional quests and explore the vast beautiful world of Monster Hunter Wilds when it launches on February 28 on PS5 *The video and images were captured from a version under development and may differ from the final product.
