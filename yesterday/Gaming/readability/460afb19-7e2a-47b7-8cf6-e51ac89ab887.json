  "text": "Hey everyone, this is Mike Tucker, design director and programmer at Bitmap Bureau. On behalf of our team, we’re thrilled to reveal Terminator 2D: No Fate, an officially licensed 2D action side-scroller is launching September 5 on PS5 and PS4! Our team poured its passion into crafting adrenaline-fueled arcade gameplay and stunning pixel art—the very elements that make games special to us. As our first licensed game, we wanted to do justice to the Terminator 2 legacy. I feel Terminator 2D: No Fate is a love letter to ‘80s/‘90s arcade games, and my mission was to create the T2 side-scroller we should have had in our youth. Players control Sarah Connor, John Connor, and the T-800 in arcade-style missions that retell Terminator 2: Judgment Day while expanding its narrative. Sarah Connor Our team are massive fans of the film—especially Sarah Connor, one of the greatest action heroes of all time. We knew playing as her would be special, so we worked hard to make her playstyle feel authentic. Sarah is agile and reactive, mirroring her paranoia and intense training. She excels in melee combat, sliding into enemies for direct attacks, reflecting her fearlessness. We also gave her a laser sight, inspired by the iconic Miles Dyson scene. It locks the player in place but significantly boosts damage. John Connor One of the most exciting parts of development was designing the Future War missions, where players control an adult John Connor leading the Resistance. Since T2 only gives glimpses of John’s leadership, we had fun expanding his lore. His gameplay emphasizes strategic mid-to-long-range combat, using a plasma rifle, pipe bombs, and three ammo types. He’s less agile than Sarah but can execute a tactical roll to evade attacks. T-800 Few characters in cinema match the sheer presence of the T-800. We made him move deliberately to emphasize his weight and power, most evident in his devastating shoulder barge. He compensates for slower speed with high durability, taking significant damage before going down. The T-800’s segments were a blast to create, especially recreating iconic moments like the Corral bar brawl and the motorcycle escape from the T-1000 in a 2D arcade style. T-1000 Of course, the T-1000 is one of the most legendary villains of all time. Robert Patrick’s unforgettable performance—his slow, intimidating walk and relentless sprint—was crucial for us to capture. Bringing his liquid metal abilities to life in pixel art was a real challenge, but our animators nailed his menace. Players will feel it when they face him in-game. Working on a title connected to such a revered film has been a huge honor. Terminator 2’s characters are among the most beloved in cinema, and we hope players enjoy playing them as much as we enjoyed bringing them to life.
