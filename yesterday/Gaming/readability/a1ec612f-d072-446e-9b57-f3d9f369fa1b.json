Developer MiHoYo announced the news in a livestream, and while it didn't get very much away at all - not even a name at this point - the developer urged players to \"stay tuned\" in a 20-second teaser showing the familiar faces of Kiana, Blade, and what looks like, but is not confirmed to be, Pokémon-esque or monster collecting gameplay.

In an investor briefing, they recently showed that GGZ, HI3, HSR are all under the Honkai IP, separate from Genshin/ZZZ/ToT which are their own IPs. So we can expect characters from at least GGZ/HI3/HSR to appear in HNA. \"There is another called Petit Planet coming soon, which is like Animal Crossing/Stardew Valley.\" New Honkai Game announced byu/Vegetable-Feedback11 inHonkaiStarRailFans are having fun speculating who they do - and do not - see in the silhouettes at the end of the teaser trailer, with some suggesting Ifa or Aventurine could be hiding in the shadows. If you're a fan of both Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail and don't want to wait for this mysterious new game, don't forget, you can now play Zenless Zone Zero. \"There's something missing from Zenless Zone Zero. Armed with a deep combat system, new urban setting, and roster of characters easy to love, it seemed like developer miHoYo was teed up for another win after recent successes Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail... and yet after playing its second beta, I'm left more confused than anything else,\" Jessica wrote in Eurogamer's Zenless Zone Zero preview feature.",
