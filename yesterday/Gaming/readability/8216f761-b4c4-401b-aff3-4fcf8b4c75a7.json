  "text": "Today, MLB The Show is excited to announce our new partnership with Homage, a renowned brand in the apparel industry. This MLB The Show x Homage collaboration creates the first officially licensed line of attire for MLB The Show fans to purchase while celebrating the legacy of MLB The Show through Homage’s expertise in quality, culture, and design.* “Marking the 20th anniversary of MLB The Show is a celebration of baseball’s enduring legacy brought to life through gaming,” says Homage Founder Ryan Vesler. “Collaborating with MLB and Sony to create apparel that honors this milestone is a privilege. Our designs pay tribute to the game’s legacy, blending its innovative spirit with vintage elements that echo the golden era of baseball, uniting generations of fans both on the field and off.” This special-edition apparel collection honors two decades of MLB The Show’s gameplay experience, and features designs inspired by the game’s past and present. From the excitement of creating your own ballplayer in Road to The Show to reliving some of the sport’s most iconic moments on the field, we look forward to sharing even more design reveals and offerings in the coming months. We’re excited to share our first t-shirt as the initial drop from the MLB The Show x Homage collection featuring MLB The Show 25’s cover athletes: Paul Skenes, Elly De La Cruz, and Gunnar Henderson. These rising stars represent the bright future of the game and set the stage for even more unique designs to come. As a sneak peek, we’ve also prepared a little behind-the-scenes imagery and footage of the art process that went into the creation of the MLB The Show x Homage collection. Can you guess which design will be on deck next?  Be sure to mark your calendars to take a lead on the competition for upcoming drops and subscribe to our social channels on X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok, sign up for The Scouting Report, and visit TheShow.com for more details on future offerings including: February 2025 – Gameplay “Deep Cuts” Collection March 2025 – Player-Inspired Collection** The MLB The Show x HOMAGE collection’s first offering will be available today, January 29, 2025, at https://homa.ge/MLBTS. *Currently only available in the U.S. **Over the course of the season, select player styles will also be available at the official MLB Store NYC, MLB Team Shops, and MLBShop.com after March 18.
