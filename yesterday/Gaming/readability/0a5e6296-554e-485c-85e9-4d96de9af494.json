Just because you're leery of buying from a private seller doesn't mean you should shy away from this marketplace. Most of the major retailers that you've heard of - including Dyson, Bose, Lenovo, Roborock, and Ecoflow - as well as authorized resellers have their own seller accounts and offer discounts that you can't find elsewhere else. Check out all of the best limited time deals we've found below.Dyson Memorial Day Deals on eBayDyson is one of the most well known household brands around, and its name is synonymous with quality... and premium pricing. But did you know that Dyson has its very own Dyson eBay store with huge markdowns on their certified refurbished products? Dyson offers a 6 month warranty on refub vacuum cleaners and fans and a 12 month warranty on their refurb beauty products and eBay also includes a 2 year AllState warranty that runs concurrently.Ecoflow Memorial Day Deals on eBayEcoflow is one of the largest and most well-known manufacturers of portable power stations. Their products are solidly built with a lot of practical features at an affordable price point. Product support after the purchase is generally pretty good, and firmware and software updates are consistently rolled out. Ecoflow sells certified refurbished power stations through its official Ecoflow eBay store. It offers the same warranty on refurbs as brand new products, which is anywhere from 24 months to 60 months depending on the model you choose.Bose Memorial Day Deals on eBayThe best Bose headphones and soundbars offer exceptional sound quality through a range of in-ear and over-ear headphones as well as best-in-class active noise cancellation. Paying extra attention to aesthetics, comfort, build, and audio, Bose is the go-to headphone brand if you want immersive sound that will block out external distractions. The official Bose eBay Store carries certified refurbished products with the same 1 year warranty as buying new as well as an additional 2 year AllState warranty that runs concurrently.Memorial Day TV Deals on eBayMemorial Day is one of the best times of the year to score a great deal on a new TV. If you don't get in on a TV deal now, your next two chances are Amazon Prime Day in July and Black Friday in November. Electronic Express on eBay currently has the best prices I've seen on several TVs, ranging from a budget Vizio TV model for under $200 to top-of-the-line OLED TVs for over 50% off. Electronic Express is also an authorized reseller for most TV brands, including Samsung, Sony, and Vizio, which means you can the full manufacturer's warranty.Roborock Memorial Day Deals on eBayRoborock is one of the largest robot vacuum brands in the world. Its products offer more features than Roomba at a more attractive price point. That doesn't mean they are lower quality. I've owned both Roborock and Roomba models and my current Roborock has lasted longer, performed better, and costs less to maintain than any of the Roombas I've owned in the past. The Roborock eBay Store carries certified refurbished units of their entire lineup of robot vacuums and mops, They carry a 6 month warranty, which is less than the 12-month warranty for new units. Fortunately, eBay is also offering its 2 year Allstate warranty that runs concurrently.More Memorial Day sales are already liveSeveral retailers including Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Dell, and Wayfair have launched their sale early. We've rounded up all of the biggest retailers that have pushed their Memorial Day sales live with deals worth checking out.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
