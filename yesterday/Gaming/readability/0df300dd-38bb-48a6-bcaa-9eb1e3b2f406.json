  "text": "The Site Every once in a while I make a statement about how if I really wanted to be a popular blogger, I would write about topic X, where topic X is something that inevitably boosts my page views when I stumble in that direction. For example, I am sure if I wrote diligently about retail World of Warcraft (though Blizz is trying to brand it as “modern” rather than “retail”… should have considered that before they named the directory structure) covering updates and events and… maybe… a post or two about actually playing retail, that would get more traction with viewers than complaining about Cataclysm Classic dragging on for so long. Anyway, I bring this up because I have something else to add to the list of topics that might make the blog more popular:  The latest No Man’s Sky update.  Or No Man’s Sky in general, really.  I suggest this because I wrote a somewhat off the cuff post about how the Worlds Part II update for the game contained an astonishing amount of content and… this happened. Google shows a big traffic spike around Feb 8 That chart with the big spike is from Google Analytics and the little circles are notes from the site that a particular day had unexpected levels of traffic… like, 10x the expected traffic on the peak day.  I had exceeded even Google’s expectations. As for where it all came from, I feel like I need to look into the WordPress Android App.  I had figured it was just the Android version of their Jetpack app.  But when I looked at the sources listed under it… it was odd. The top TAGN referrers – Feb 2025 The top item under the WordPress Android App is effectively a Google search.  So those should be really be counted under Search Engines.  But Google Analytics counts them all as direct sources and not from organic search (the terms they use).  Which means… what?  I guess that Google is even more responsible my traffic than I considered. So that is why the post about the NMS Worlds Part II is at the top of the most viewed posts this month, and by such a distance that I think its views add up to more than all other posts viewed this past month combined.  Take from that whatever lesson you wish. Also, a shout out to whoever posted my “Jenny and the FCC” telephone tales post over to Hacker News. Meanwhile, I neglected to mention last month… or maybe it was before then… that among the changes WP.com applied to the dashboard was the removal of the search terms section.  So that now comes from the Google Search Console, where I cherry pick a theme rather than taking whatever WP.com throws at me.  The end of spontaneity I suppose.  I do limit myself to search terms that generated exactly one click, if that means anything to you. One Year Ago I was setting up a new computer… I’m not sure how many times I’ve done that in my life now.  But that meant considering what I ought to re-download from Steam. UbiSoft was just trying to piss me off by calling Skull and Bones a “AAAA” title. (Spoiler: It was not.) We were coming up on the EverQuest 25th anniversary and I was reviewing how I might approach it.  I decided to go with starting points, beginning with Surefall Glade, Qeynos Hills, finding Qeynos, then into Qeynos itself. We also got a 20th anniversary roadmap for EverQuest II… and if you wanted to attend Fippy Fest in person, that was going to be $1,500… airfare and hotel not included. On the corporate front there was the Q4 2023 financial report, which included something about selling off the PlanetSide IP, while an institutional investor was demanding more money from EG7.  Shareholder value is all that matters. Meanwhile, over at the train wreck that is/was the Embracer Group, Lars from Mars was telling people that he was somehow claiming to be maximizing shareholder value.  Again, all that matters. The group had Valheim up and going again, with Eikthyr down we were killing trolls and sailing boats once more.  We then defeated The Edler and got into trouble right away in the swamps.  We got that straightened out and defeated Bonemass and headed to the mountains.  Also, I learned not to put the obliterator next to a structure… and we had our first mod conflict issue. While we had gone for Valheim once more, I was still eyeing the competition. In WoW Classic we were still playing Wrath of the Lich King and I had my rogue, my sixth character into the expansion, figuring out how to get his lock picking up to snuff.  I also did a Friday bullet points post about a new president at Blizzard, a pet from Prime Games, Season of Discovery updates, and the original Diablo showing up in Blizzard’s online store. In New Eden I looked at the EVE Online MER for January and did two Friday bullet point posts. The first one about lunar new year deals, the new launcher, the War for New Eden Kickstarter campaign, mineral prices spiking in the MER, and an in-game tax increase.  The second bullet points post featured the expiration of the south east agreement, the successful completion of the War for New Eden Kickstarter, a big patch for Havoc, and the CSM summit news. Elon hadn’t gone full Nazi yet, but Twitter was X and people were realizing that he was not as smart as he had led on, while Blue Sky finally got past the invite only stage, and everybody was bickering about what platform people should… though it was trending towards anything but X. And on the Telephone Tales front I was moving to enterprise software, talking about stock options and IPOs, and Finally, I wrote about my congressional district which, for the first time in 30 years, had an open seat up for grabs and all the people running for it. Five Years Ago The anticipated Torchlight Frontiers MMORPG was demoted to Torchlight III, another action RPG with multiplayer support. Daybreak was warming up for the EverQuest 21st anniversary. Blizzard reported a decent Q4 for 2019, at least compared to the rest of the year.  WoW Classic helped.  A lot.  But the Warcraft III Reforged fiasco was not likely to help Blizz for Q1 2020. Over at CCP Project Nova, the latest attempt at a first person shooter, was transitioning into some other project.  But they were going to keep that quiet until the had something real to bring to us.  They also cancelled FanFest in Iceland over corona virus fears, and rightly so. For the February update in EVE Online we got the Guardians Gala, new implant sets, and the start of what would become a year of nerfing mining into oblivion.  CCP gave us some skill points for being down due to a DDoS attack.  The also announced a plan to fix undercutting in the market. Out in New Eden the Goon Expeditionary Force was formed and went out on its first deployment.  I managed to get on a bunch of kill mails in my ECM burst interceptor.  We were also out shooting structures and As fall out from the death of Guardians of the Galaxy coalition, Ranger Regiment joined the Imperium. I also compare raids, where up to 40 people need to coordinate, with fleet ops in EVE Online, where up to 255 people work as a team, facing off against another group generally of equal size. In WoW Classic the instance group was working on the Scarlet Monastery Cathedral wing, then we were back again to finish up a quest.  Then I summed up all of our Scarlet Monastery time over the years in a post, including a mock version of the place in Neverwinter. Then we were off to Razorfen Downs. As we were getting to level 40, I wondered how close we were to being half way to level cap.  There are a variety of ways to measure that. I was also still playing the EverQuest II expansion, and even bought a couple Krono as my cash resources were rather meager. And then there was Camelot Unchained, where City State Entertainment announced that they were working on another game which would somehow magically speed up delivery of the game that was already four years past the promised date, prompting people to ask for refunds, myself included.  Of course, getting a refund was not easy, and City State was not at all inclined to be helpful, with Mark Jacobs himself showing up to tell me I must be dumb to not have all the details of a seven year old credit card charge close to hand, but I ended up finally finding the transaction ID from the 2013 pledge and got a refund, minus processing fees. Ten Years Ago Sony Online Entertainment ceased to be, having been sold off to Columbus Nova and rebranded as Daybreak Games Company.  The launch was not auspicious to my mind, with Columbus Nova issuing a questionable press release while the new company shed many old hands.  Still, classic Norrath seemed to be safe.  New progression servers for EverQuest were announced fairly quickly thereafter. H1Z1 was out in early access (or “recently launched” according to Columbus Nova) and having some issues.  Polygon took my own point of view in stating that if a company is out there taking money for a game then they felt entitled to review it as it stood. The Crowfall Kickstarter campaign launched and the game quickly hit its initial goal.  Meanwhile, I was wondering how Nebula Online, another project with a Kickstarter, was going to make any money. Massively and WoW Insider were recreating themselves as Massively OP and Blizzard Watch. I was still playing WoW , which still had 10 million subscribers, while looking towards the 6.1 patch was due.  I was doing pet battles and looking at my addons. I was also still flailing about a bit with Elite: Dangerous. Star Wars: The Old Republic seemed headed back to that vaunted fourth pillar. The Tiamat expansion hit EVE Online, unleashing the Svipul menace.  CCP was bribing people to vote in the CSMX election. And for the monthly blog banter walking in stations came up again.  I was also figuring out how to change my space clothes and Reavers were making a difference. The now defunct BattleClinic had just finished their site overhaul, allowing players to mine more data out of their kill mails. Then there was Juche. And, finally, a farewell to Leonard Nimoy. Fifteen Years Ago We learned SynCaine’s shameful secret. I was invited to go play in the beta for the web based Crown of Byzantus.  It didn’t really stick with me, though I wrote about it a couple of times. There was another press release or some such for a Wheel of Time MMO.  My call then: It isn’t going to happen.  And it still hasn’t happened.  And it isn’t going to happen. Ten Ton Hammer made a list of their Top Ten PvP MMOs, and there was some chagrin that Ultima Online didn’t make the cut.  Also, I was surprised to see that their site still exists as of this writing.  I mean, they still have EverQuest Next on their front page, so the place isn’t being kept up, but somebody is still paying the hosting bill. For reasons I cannot recall, Conner at MMO Fallout started looking into how MMO companies ranked over at the Better Business Bureau. There was an announcement for a new game… World of Tanks! In World of Warcraft, the instance group did Scarlet Monastery, Uldaman, and got as far as Zul’Farrak in our horde adventures, though we were still forgetting we could use the Dungeon Finder.  Otherwise we were running around doing holiday events and the like.  Also, I finally fished that last coin out of the fountain in Dalaran. Oh, the Dungeon Finder.  My first runs with that were… not so good.  I seemed to run into some cliche bad groups. Meanwhile, WoW decided to emulate WebKinz and start selling stuffed animals that had codes for in-game versions.  My daughter wanted that Windrider Cub real bad. Hi-Rez Studios launched Global Agenda.  The game went down during a server move in 2018 and was later reported as dead for good. Over in EverQuest II the Sentinal’s Fate expansion launched.  The sixth expansion for the game, it raised the level cap from 80 to 90.  I remember almost nothing specific about this expansion The Azeroth Advisor went buh-bye.  Thanks for killing it 38 Studios!  Screw you Curt Schilling!  I saved all the email tips they sent me, however they were all pretty much worthless post-Cataclysm.  Also, they were full of live links that no longer work.  Ah well. Finally, there was Star Trek Online.  The head start ended, The game went full-live, I was fiddling with my super special pre-order collector’s edition junk, and I gave out some codes in a caption contest.  There was even some new content.  But by month’s end, STO faded for me… which was bad since I had purchased a lifetime subscription.  Possibly the worst video game purchase of my life… and I bought Tabula Rasa and Shroud of the Avatar! Twenty Years Ago The Dragons of Norrath expansion launched for EverQuest. Twenty-Five Years Ago The Sims launched, becoming a staple of video games sales lists for well over a decade and one of the best selling video game franchises of all time.

Enshrouded – 42.65% Pokemon Go – 26.64% Civ 2 – 12.84% EVE Online – 9.22% Balatro – 4.45% Stars Reach – 2.16% No Man’s Sky – 1.75% WoW Classic – 0.18% World of Warcraft – 0.06% Otherwise, Enshrouded topped the list… and I might have peeked in on Azeroth, but I didn’t spend much time there. Civilization II Hey, with a new version Civilization series shipping this past month, I did feel a bit of longing to go back and play.  But I wasn’t keen to spend the $70 on what was sounding like a less than finished title. (Reviews are only 50% positive, and the most popular negative reviews basically say the game needs a lot of work.)  I thought about installing Civ V again… and may yet.  But I already had Civ II ready to roll and, after a couple of false starts, played one game through to the bitter end.  I had forgotten it ended in the year 2020.  We live in a future beyond the game’s scope! Enshrouded The group continued to explore and expand in Enshrouded, culminating in our fight with the dragon, the current final boss in the game.  As I noted yesterday, there is more to do and to see, but the character progression arc is somewhat on hold for now. EVE Online I did go on a couple of fleets and got on my obligatory monthly kill mail.  A structure shoot!  How exciting.  But most of my time in New Eden was spent tending to my PI, hauling it back to market, and selling it.  I also started sorting through the piles of modules and hulls in our stager and began selling off a lot of that too.  I am at my all time peak for ISK in hand, with 27 billion.  If I were smart I would invest it in PLEX and wait for inflation to do its job.  But I have never been very smart, at least not in New Eden. Pokemon Go Niantic, when not spending time trying to sell the game off, changed up the Pokedex in the app, so I can no longer tell how many Pokemon I have seen but not caught.  It is also a bit of a pain to get my total caught, as it is all broken out into the regional groupings.  But I did make some progress towards level 48.  More on that in a later post, as I made a silly discovery about how I play. Level: 47 – 50% of the way to 48 Task Status 10 souvenirs from buddy – 10/10 Earn 300 hearts with your buddy – 300/300 Walk 200km with your buddy – 154/200 Walk 25km a week for eight weeks – 1/8 Pokedex status: 864 (+3) caught out of 1,008 in the Pokedex Pokemon I want: Carnivine, a missing Sinnoh entry Current buddy: Vivillon Stars Reach There were, and continue to be, quite a few play test opportunities to try out the pre-alpha, all in support of the Kickstarter.  Even if it is only a small slice of the game, there is at least something there to be seen and tried.  More than Mark Jacobs has given us in over a decade. That said, I have not spent much time there myself.  The tests are really demos at the moment, and not much new will likely arrive until the Kickstarter is done.  No need to introduce any potential problems, best to keep things stable and simple until then. The Kickstarter itself blew through its very modest goal and we’re into the stretch goals… and soon, into the doldrums of the mid-campaign.  Again, I have thoughts about that I will get to later. Coming Up EverQuest will turn 26.  Do we care?  Nobody cared when I turned 26.  Then again, lots of people turn 26, but not so many live service video games do.  We shall see if I care mark the date again this year after the effort I put in for the 25th. Lord of the Rings Online is threatening to launch their 64-bit server.  This, as I have said in the past, is pretty much a baseline necessity for the ongoing survival of the game.  Support for 32-bit apps won’t last forever.  That they are making it a circus with transfers… that is a problem of their own making  We shall see which characters, if any, I decide to move. Otherwise, we’ll carry on for a bit with Enshrouded.  Maybe something interesting will happen in EVE Online.  The Fantasy Critic League will carry on.  And my wife and I will likely still be playing Pokemon Go. But, as I have suggested previously, it might be time to find some character progression title I can play in the evening while listening to a podcast or an audio book.  Something that will hold my attention just enough without too much of a commitment.  I have some ideas.",

applied to the dashboard was the removal of the search terms section.  So that now comes from the Google Search Console, where I cherry pick a theme rather than taking whatever WP.com throws at me.  The end of spontaneity I suppose.  I do limit myself to search terms that generated exactly one click, if that means anything to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOne Year

in a future beyond the game’s scope!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnshrouded\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group continued to explore and expand in \u003cem\u003eEnshrouded\u003c/em\u003e, culminating in our fight with the dragon, the current final boss in the game.  As I \u003ca

for now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEVE Online\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did go on a couple of fleets and got on my obligatory monthly \u003ca href=\"https://zkillboard.com/kill/124901967/\"\u003ekill mail\u003c/a\u003e.  A structure shoot!  How exciting.  But most of my time in New Eden was spent tending to my PI, hauling it back to market, and selling it.  I also started sorting through the piles of modules and hulls in our stager and began selling off a lot of that too.  I am at my all time peak for ISK in hand, with 27 billion.  If I were smart I would invest it in PLEX and wait for inflation to do its job.  But I have never been very smart, at least not in New Eden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePokemon Go\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNiantic, when not spending time trying to sell the game off, changed up the Pokedex in the app, so I can no longer tell how many Pokemon I have seen but not caught.  It is also a bit of a pain to get my total caught, as it is all broken out into the regional groupings.  But I did make some progress towards level 48.  More on that in a later post, as I made a silly discovery about how I play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLevel: 47 – 50% of the way to 48\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTask Status\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e10

to try out the pre-alpha, all in support of the Kickstarter.  Even if it is only a small slice of the game, there is at least something there to be seen and tried.  More than Mark Jacobs has given us in over a decade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, I have not spent much time there myself.  The tests are really demos at the moment, and not much new will likely arrive until the Kickstarter is done.  No need to introduce any potential problems, best to keep things stable and simple until then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kickstarter itself blew through its very modest goal and we’re into the stretch goals… and soon, into the doldrums of the mid-campaign.  Again, I have thoughts about that I will get to later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eComing

live service video games do.  We shall see if I care mark the date again this year after the effort I put in for the 25th.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eLord of the Rings Online\u003c/em\u003e is threatening to launch their 64-bit server.  This, as I have said in the past, is pretty much a baseline necessity for the ongoing survival of the game.  Support for 32-bit apps won’t last forever.  That they are making it a circus with transfers… that is a problem of their own making  We shall see which characters, if any, I decide to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtherwise, we’ll carry on for a bit with \u003cem\u003eEnshrouded\u003c/em\u003e.  Maybe something interesting will happen in \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e.  The Fantasy Critic League will carry on.  And my wife and I will likely still be playing \u003cem\u003ePokemon Go\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, as I have suggested previously, it might be time to find some character progression title I can play in the evening while listening to a podcast or an audio book.  Something that will hold my attention just enough without too much of a commitment.  I have some ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
