Let’s dig in.Does Captain America: Brave New World have a mid-credits scene?Nope! Which is also a significant surprise, since even MCU movies with no post-credits sequence usually still throw in a mid-credits beat to wrap up some small bit of business from the movie.

But while that’s the question everyone always Googles while sitting in the theater watching the credits roll by, the real question should be “Was that post-credits scene shot 15 years ago and never updated? What the hell is that exchange about, and what are we supposed to get from it?” Full spoilers for the scene ahead.What happens in Captain America: Brave New World’s post-credits scene?The sequence opens with the movie’s big villain, Samuel Sterns, incarcerated in The Raft, the MCU’s floating prison for superpowered individuals. (Tim Blake Nelson was established in the role as Sterns in 2008’s The Incredible Hulk. As of this movie, he still hasn’t been labeled “The Leader,” the name of this character in Marvel Comics continuity.) Captain America (Anthony Mackie) comes to talk to him, apparently having been told Sterns has something to say.Sterns’ message is the kind of threat that would normally be designed to set up a future Marvel movie: “It’s coming. I’ve seen it in the probabilities. You think this is the only world? Let’s see what happens when you have to protect this world from the others.”What the hell does ‘the others’ mean?So okay. I know Samuel Sterns has been imprisoned at a government black site for the past 15 years, where he’s been doing life-sustaining medical work for “Thunderbolt” Ross (Harrison Ford) out of a grimy, neon-lit lab that looks like a torture dungeon from a Saw movie. So maybe he doesn’t have a ton of access to the news, to go with his in-depth access to the American military personnel files he has all over his walls. But “protecting your world from the others” is most of what Marvel heroes have been doing since around 2011’s Thor.Does Sterns know Thor came from a different planet, and so did a giant destructive robot that made a huge mess on Earth? Did he miss out on the Chitauri invasion in The Avengers? What about Thanos’ lackeys smashing up New York City and Thanos himself obliterating half the life on Earth (just for starters) in Avengers: Infinity War? Or the full-on Thanos invasion in Avengers: Endgame, or the worldwide alien terrorist plot of Secret Invasion, or the alien that literally hatched out of the earth in Eternals, prompting much of the plot of Brave New World?Image: Marvel Studios“Other worlds” invading Earth is old, old news in the MCU. Heck, even the upcoming franchise installment The Fantastic Four: First Steps is going to deal with an alien invasion… which happened back in the 1960s.So maybe he means “other worlds” in the multiverse sense? This would be a lot more logical, since that’s a newer MCU threat, known to fewer people. But Brave New World is the penultimate movie in the MCU’s Phase Five, the second part of the “Multiverse Saga” — even if Sam Wilson himself hasn’t been dealing with multiverse incursions, it’s pretty familiar ground for MCU fans, who’ve been getting a pile-on of multiverse-focused stories since season 1 of Loki back in 2021. Which makes Stearns’ threat feel pretty tame — the equivalent of Mike Myers’ Dr. Evil in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery emerging from 30 years of cryo-sleep, completely out of touch with the value of modern money, and launching a blackmail plan for “One meeeeeeellion dollars!”In keeping with Marvel’s usual foreshadowing, though, it feels like the “other worlds” threat should somehow be queuing up the eventual threat of Dr. Doom, which seems to have replaced the multiversal threat of infinite Kangs that Marvel Studios had to scrap after Jonathan Majors’ assault trial. Maybe Doom is an alt-universe villain now? Or he has extraterrestrial ties? Or maybe there are aliens we don’t know about coming in Thunderbolts* in May? No matter what the answer is, it sure isn’t clear in a way that would make it feel like a meaningful teaser here. And it feels like a weak, vague jab to aim at someone who just stood his ground against Red Hulk.",

This would be a lot more logical, since that’s a newer MCU threat, known to fewer people. But \u003cem\u003eBrave New World\u003c/em\u003e is the penultimate movie in the MCU’s Phase Five, the second part of the “Multiverse Saga” — even if Sam Wilson himself hasn’t been dealing with multiverse incursions, it’s pretty familiar ground for MCU fans, who’ve been getting a pile-on of multiverse-focused stories since season 1 of \u003cem\u003eLoki\u003c/em\u003e back in 2021. Which makes Stearns’ threat feel pretty tame — the equivalent of Mike Myers’ Dr. Evil in \u003cem\u003eAustin Powers: International Man of Mystery \u003c/em\u003eemerging from 30 years of cryo-sleep, completely out of touch with the value of modern money, and launching a blackmail plan for \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJR1H5tf5wE\"\u003e“One meeeeeeellion dollars!”\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn keeping with Marvel’s usual foreshadowing, though, it feels like the “other worlds” threat should somehow be queuing up \u003ca href=\"https://www.polygon.com/sdcc/24207892/robert-downey-jr-doctor-doom-marvel\"\u003ethe eventual threat of Dr. Doom\u003c/a\u003e, which seems to have replaced \u003ca href=\"https://www.polygon.com/23602923/who-is-kang-he-who-remains-immortus-council-of-kangs\"\u003ethe multiversal threat of infinite Kangs\u003c/a\u003e that Marvel Studios had to scrap after \u003ca href=\"https://www.polygon.com/23690099/marvel-jonathan-majors-dropped-kang-recast\"\u003eJonathan Majors’ assault trial\u003c/a\u003e. Maybe Doom is an alt-universe villain now? Or he has extraterrestrial ties? Or maybe there are aliens we don’t know about coming in \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.polygon.com/trailer/521268/thunderbolts-villain-super-bowl-ad-trailer\"\u003eThunderbolts*\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003ein May? No matter what the answer is, it sure isn’t clear in a way that would make it feel like a meaningful teaser here. And it feels like a weak, vague jab to aim at someone who just stood his ground against Red Hulk.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
