  "text": "This, of course, begs the question as to whether Threads was ever alive.  Sure, it was and remains lively in its own special way.  But there was a joke going around on Threads a couple months back along the lines of: Using Threads is like dating Leonardo DiCaprio: No engagement I would credit the person whom I saw post that joke, except the feed refreshed and it was from somebody I did not follow directly, so it was lost in the ether, unfindable, never to surface in my feed again.  And that was just the first of many problems with Threads. Threads was hastily spun up to fill the void that was opening as Elon Musk wrecked Twitter by turning into into pro-MAGA Nazi bar with all user protections stripped away and where his every post is now injected into every user’s timeline.  You cannot block Elon (or anybody anymore) and you can’t even ignore him by not following him.  You will listen and obey and if you disagree your posts will be removed.  All that is left for X is to pay Trump off by buying and integrating Truth Social into it. As I have said in the past, Zuck must have been thanking his lucky stars that Elon is out there being the biggest, loudest billionaire idiot because otherwise people might pay attention to him and his antics. Zuckerberg at his best… nobody paid attention to this for sure… And then Zuck apparently decided rather than fighting Elon… there was literally a challenge to a physical match between the two until Elon’s mother told him he couldn’t… true story, look it up… he wants to become Elon. Not that he wasn’t always a creep.  Facebook started off as essentially a “hot or not” app to rate his college classmates.  But he wanted to be seen as good.  He wanted to be liked and admired.  So he did a lot of things to create the appearance of doing the right thing.  Now, however, he seems to have taken to just being Elon.  But we’ll get to that in a bit.  Let’s get back to Threads. Threads was kind of an odd experience relative to Twitter.  From day one it felt off, mostly because it was built on top of Instagram and used the same algorithm to push content into your feed.  Look at something about model trains, your feed will be all model trains. Seeing just stuff from the people you follow or find stuff you saw yesterday in your feed… not possible.   But have a bunch of random new stuff from strangers that is somewhat adjacent to something you looked at yesterday… that is the Threads experience. There were a lot of people on Threads.  There still are.  But the claims to success put out by Meta, the name Facebook too when it wanted to hide from its wrongdoing in the 2016 presidential campaign, was largely based on the number of accounts, which was a dubious stat at best because everybody who ever had an Instagram account automatically got a Threads account. Instant success. My personal experience on Threads over time was that things were decaying.  Most of the people I had followed stopped posting… or I stopped seeing them… it is honestly hard to tell… and we got to a point a few weeks ago where my feed was basically just algorithm stuffing from the same dozen accounts, mostly posting Luigi Mangione/United Healthcare memes because I had liked something at some past point that triggered that. I was still putting my daily posts for both blogs up there, but it was yielding no traffic and microscopic engagement… usually likes from obvious sexual services accounts… so just like Instagram.  The site was low engagement for me at its peak, but went almost completely to the Leonardo DiCaprio model by the close of summer. So it felt to me like things were not going well, that Threads was on a downhill run.  Months ago, during the great X.com exodus, there was some “Threads vs. Blue Sky” tension with Threads fans mocking the “smaller” service, even as its daily user activity grew and surpassed it. But the first tangible sign that things were not well at Threads was the announcement that they were going to start running AI drive accounts, pretending to be real people.  As Damion Schubert put it: Backfilling a video game with bots because not enough people logged on to play deathmatch is very common and very expected. Backfilling a social media platform with bots because not enough people logged on to post cat pictures is very funny and very sad. The platform making fake accounts to create content isn’t some sort of belief in the future of AI or attempt to make a better platform.  It is the sort of thing you do when overall use and engagement is dropping and shows no sign of leveling off.  And this isn’t some sort of anti-AI hysteria.  It would be as bad for Zuck to hire a developing world call center full of people to just create fake content all day.  But he doesn’t have to do that because AI will automate it and only be 20% more obviously fake. And it is bad because people don’t go to a social media site to engage with bots, AI or otherwise.  You can do that directly now with any number of crappy AI options.  You go to a social media site to engage with people.  They may be crappy people with awful views and dubious motives, but some of them post pictures of their cats and that can be enough most days.  There was such an outcry about the AI accounts that Meta had to pull them back… for now. Back to relying on cat pictures. Cat pictures keep the internet going, but Threads was struggling with even that it seems.  Over on Instagram, where I was maintaining an account for our cats… doing my part… it kept telling me about all the stuff on Threads I should be looking at because… please use Threads dammit. Our cats have no interest in Threads. And then Zuck went all “No more mister nice guy!” over the last month… which felt a lot more like revealing his true self than any sort of actual change of heart.  I mean, sure, he gave his million dollars to the Trump Inaugural slush fund like so many other billionaires keen to bend the knee and show they are ready for the next four years of “pay to play” business deals with the White House. But he also appears to be falling in line with the MAGA future as he sees it.  So it is out with his hired fact checkers… and this is one of those things where he did a low effort job, didn’t get adulation for having done something, and felt resentment for not being hailed for the minimal effort… to go with community notes.  This was pitched as “more free speech,” which is very much parallel to the Elon statements of the past, and we have seen how that turned out. This was followed by a shakeup of auto moderation, where anything seen to be furthering the “gay agenda” or whatever is now being flagged as adult content.  Pride is now porn.  But to be anti-Pride, anti-trans, anti-immigrant, and whatever conspiracy you care to concoct around any of that, that is now legitimate political discourse.  So it isn’t about free speech at all, it is about favoring specific speech… speech that just happens to align with the MAGA populist line.  If Facebook, Instagram, and Threads were bad before, it will be worse now as you awful relatives won’t have their Protocols of the Elders of Zion inspired conspiracy theories suppressed at all any more. All of which has naturally led to an fresh exodus from Threads, Instagram, and Facebook as it is now viewed as the new nazi bar in town.  Zuck is now fighting with Elon for that sweet, sweet MAGA demographic. That people are leaving was confirmed by Zuck himself getting publicly upset about the whole thing, declaring leaving Meta platforms as “virtue signalling.”  He big mad! Again, “virtue signalling” is an almost gymnastically flexible term, generally meaning when somebody is, um, doing the right thing merely to be seen doing the right thing… do I have that right… like declining to patronize a bar that has just put up the “nazis welcome” sign over the front door… but that thing is something you don’t agree with.  Like going to that bar.  The one that welcomes nazis.  Because you think that is fine.  And have, in fact, invited the nazis over to your place promising to cater to them.  Or something. But it apparently DOES NOT mean wriggling around and doing things looking for public approval, as Zuck has been doing for the last two decades at this point. Completely different things! Oh, and he is going to move a bunch of operations to Texas and is deleting trans themes in apps and just doing a bunch of stuff clearly in search of approval from somebody.  It certainly isn’t approval from his staff he is seeking, as reports are they were surprised by this sudden change.  Facebook was founded on misogynistic bro culture, but the people who do the actual work are a large and diverse group that is even now being subjected to gaslighting by Meta management and HR that the new pro hate speech stance is really good for them in the long run. The Meta logic is that people will get it the hate out of their systems and things will get better, in stark contrast to literally everything we have witnessed in the last decade or so.  Or in all of history, really. It is a lie and Meta knows it. Anyway, the discussion has turned into trying to decide if Zuck is afraid of Trump and trying to conform, really believes all of this, or is, and always was, just a creep looking for validation to fill some void in his life.  He went on Joe Rogen and reviews are that it was all whining and recriminations about how we don’t appreciate him enough.  Basically the fanciful “no more mister nice guy” thing again. How did billionaires become such an aggrieved minority?  Zuck, Musk, Bezos, Andreeson… all a bunch of thin skinned techno-wimps.  You’d almost think that they believed, deep down inside, that they were not wholly responsible for their huge success and still feel they need to prove themselves. In the end, it doesn’t look like good news for Threads or Meta overall.  Sure, maybe Threads isn’t dead by any real measure (and you uncle isn’t going to continue being all MAGA on Facebook, only more so now) but it is certainly dead to me. Addendum: I keep seeing Zuck getting worse and worse.  I started this before he was on Joe Rogen and now I see he is saying he is worried there isn’t enough aggressive masculinity at Meta.  He is out there compensating for something, but it is hard to tell exactly what.
