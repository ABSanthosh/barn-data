  "text": "Akaku Forest is a puzzle platformer inspired by Hawaiian mythology where you need to use your weapon as a platform. This is a unique-feeling platformer where you play as Aki Maku, the only person that can save their land. The gods of your homeland are being corrupted by a dark, mysterious force and nobody seems to know how to stop it. While exploring and trying to find answers, you have stumbled upon a mysterious orb that has chosen you to be the Soulfire Torch holder. This torch is what makes Akaku Forest feel special. While following the orb’s guidance through this massive land, you will be using your torch to defeat enemies and to plunge it into the walls of the world, using it as a platform to get to the next area. You can also throw it far, connecting with other places that might need a bit of fire to trigger new platforms. These little puzzles, along with block-pulling and button-pushing ones, create an interesting world where you might need to double back on yourself or figure out the next new way forward. In the end, you will need to defeat the dark threat of Oktokio to save your land. I played Akaku Forest at Pocket Gamer Connects Barcelona, where I did enjoy the throwing and movement of this platformer. There was something really satisfying about hurling your weapon, having it stick just right, and then using the newly created platform to make it to the next area. The world itself is also quite fun to see, with new areas popping up and showing more to discover. There are even big boss fights (that I didn’t quite get to see) which add a lot of fun to the game itself. The game also has roots inspired by Hawaiian mythology – something I do not often find in games! Akaku Forest is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can grab a demo from itch.io.
