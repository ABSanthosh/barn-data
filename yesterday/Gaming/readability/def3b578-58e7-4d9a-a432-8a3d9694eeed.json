  "text": "SummaryTurn-based, character-focused, stand-alone tactical RPG.Set in the dark fantasy world of King Arthur: Knight’s Tale.Conquer Avalon with heroes from the abyss. Here at NeocoreGames, we are excited to share that King Arthur: Legion IX is coming to Xbox Series X|S. Legion IX is a turn-based, character-focused tactical RPG set in the dark fantasy world of our previous game King Arthur: Knight’s Tale. Whether you’re a seasoned tactician or diving into Avalon for the first time, we think there’s something here for you in this stand-alone adventure: New heroes, new story and, of course, plenty of tough battles to sink your sword (or gladius in this case) into. The Ninth Legion Rises  A new threat has arrived on Avalon, and it’s not your usual band of marauders. The infamous Ninth Legion of Rome – lost to history – has marched straight out of the depths of Tartarus and onto the mystical island. Their leader, Gaius Julius Mento, was once a proud Roman tribune. Now he commands a demonic legion, a twisted gift from their dead emperor, Septimus Sulla. But Gaius has bigger ambitions: he wants to conquer Avalon and build an Eternal Rome. First, though, he must reunite his scattered legion. A Roman Invasion of Avalon You will step into Gaius Julius Mento’s boots and lead the Ninth Legion through a brutal, Roman-themed campaign. You’ll have to battle nightmare-fueled monsters, clash with fierce Pict tribes, and face off against the ancient Fomorians and cunning Sídhe. You might even cross swords with the knights of Sir Mordred’s Round Table, first introduced in King Arthur: Knight’s Tale. Across fifteen handcrafted missions, you’ll carve your path through Avalon and decide Gaius’ fate. Tactical Combat Meets Role-Playing If you like strategy and character-driven stories, you’ll be in for a treat. In King Arthur: Legion IX, you control a squad of five to six unique heroes as you explore and battle through the mystical land of Avalon. Combat in this game revolves around using cover, setting traps, flanking enemies and mastering the overwatch and opportunity system to turn the tide of battle. Heroes from the Abyss Legion IX introduces six new heroes, each with unique skills and playstyles. You’ll have to level them up, unlock their skill trees and equip them with powerful artifacts to become the deadliest force in Avalon. Whether you prefer a methodical approach or charging straight into battle, you’ll have the tools to build your characters your way. Build Nova Roma Conquering Avalon is no small feat, and you’ll need a proper stronghold to do it. We wanted to make the rebuilding of Nova Roma a fundamental part of the game. This means that you’ll have to manage resources, upgrade buildings and facilities in between battles, and make sure your heroes are ready for whatever comes next. Your Choices Shape the Story At the heart of Legion IX there is a choice that will define Gaius Julius Mento’s journey. Your decisions throughout the campaign will shape not only Gaius’ fate, but the future of Avalon itself.  We hope you’re ready to lead the Ninth Legion and we’ll see you on the battlefield on May 6, 2025. King Arthur: Legion IX is a turn-based, character-centric tactical RPG in the King Arthur: Knight's Tale universe – a dark fantasy version of the Arthurian myth. King Arthur: Legion IX welcomes new players to the mythical land of Avalon with an all-new story and heroes, also offering tough challenges to returning veterans. A new threat looms over Avalon as the long-lost, infamous Ninth Legion of Rome has set foot on the mythical island. Their commander, the fallen hero, Gaius Julius Mento was granted a demonic legion by their dead emperor, Septimus Sulla to find a way out of Tartarus. But when they accidentally arrive to the magical realm of the Lady of the Lake, Gaius Julius Mento decides to subjugate the island and establish Eternal Rome there. First, however, he must gather his lost legion… Play through a Roman-themed campaign as Gaius Julius Mento, a tribune of the undead Ninth Legion, as he discovers Avalon. Battle the monsters of nightmares, challenge the Pict tribes, the monstrous Fomorians and the cunning Sídhe. Experience the might of the Old Faith and Christianity and face the knights of Sir Mordred's Round Table through 15 handcrafted missions. Find, rebuild and protect the remains of the only Roman colony in Avalon and choose your path to victory. By the end of the campaign, you'll have to choose: do you want to become a powerful demon, or will you reject the might of Emperor Sulla and restore your humanity? A Role-playing Tactical Adventure: Experience a unique hybrid between turn-based tactical games and traditional, character-centric RPGs. Manage and control a party of 5-6 heroes to explore and conquer the land of Avalon. Engage in deep tactical combat, tough moral choices, hero management, and the rebuilding of Nova Roma. Prove your Worth as a Tactician: Every little move and every decision matters. Use covers, traps, flanking and an in-dept overwatch and opportunity system and turn the entire battlefield to your advantage like a master tactician. Sometimes meticulous planning, sometimes charging simply to combat will be the key to victory. The only difference between a successful or a failed quest may depend on the composition of your party only! Heroes Straight from the Abyss: Legion IX introduces six unique heroes who have risen from the Abyss to conquer the mythical land of Avalon. Level up, gain skill points and unlock unique skill trees. Loot, equip and craft hundreds of artefacts and create the deadliest fighting force that has ever set foot on Avalon. Wide variety of Abilities: Use unique skills, Ultimate Skills and World Abilities to overcome the toughest challenges during your quests in Avalon. Take risks and explore various tactical options as heroes don't face permanent death at the end of the missions. Test your skills in different difficulty modes, from laid-back storytelling to brutal, unforgiving battles. Not Built in a Day: Build up and expand the city of Nova Roma. Make sure that your stronghold has the right facilities for your heroes that prepare them for different quests. But beware! Resources are scarce and you have to manage Nova Roma thoughtfully to keep it afloat. Regain your Humanity: Your decisions have far-reaching consequences, influencing both gameplay and narrative. Through your actions, Gaius will either restore his humanity, or forever be transformed into a demon.",
