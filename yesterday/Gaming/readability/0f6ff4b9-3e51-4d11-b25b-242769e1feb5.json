Mondo's new Clayface figure is easily one of their most impressive releases to date.IGN can exclusively reveal the first images and details for Mondo's Clayface 1:6 scale figure. Get a closer look in the slideshow gallery below:Mondo Batman: The Animated Series Clayface Figure - Image GalleryThe Clayface 1:6 scale figure features a concept design by Alex Brewer, sculpting by Alex Brewer and Tommy Hodges, painting by Hector Arce and Mark Bristow, packaging art by Danny Haas, packaging design by Jordan Christianson, and photography by Raúl Barrero.The Clayface figure includes a wide array of accessories and interchangeable pieces, including several alternate heads and various hands. One of the biggest selling points with this figure, however, is that is features a semi-seamless joint design, with the body covering up an internal, ratcheting skeleton. As is usually the case with Mondo's Batman figures, Clayface will be sold as both a regular version (priced at $260) and an exclusive edition figure (priced at $280) limited to 1500 units. The exclusive edition includes several additional interchangeable parts, including a stabbed portrait, an imitation Batman portrait, and a trapped Batman chest accessory. You can preorder the regular edition here and preorder the exclusive edition here. Both versions are expected to ship in July 2025.For more on Mondo's Batman: The Animated Series line, see the recent Poison Ivy 1:6 scale figure.
