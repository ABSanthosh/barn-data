  "text": "SummaryConfront unspeakable horrors in Post Trauma.Haunting, atmospheric soundtrack from Nicolas Gasparini (Myuu).Fully voice-acted cast including Togo Igawa as Roman. While it’s almost time to say farewell to 2024, with a new year on the horizon comes an undiscovered, terrifying and twisted reality to explore. In 2025, Post Trauma launches on Xbox, bringing a whole host of unimaginable nightmares along for the ride. Post Trauma comes from the imagination ofRoberto Serrag and Red Soul Games, designed as a celebration of classic horror titles like Silent Hill and Resident Evil. Built with Unreal Engine 5, Post Trauma is set in recognizable environments – such as an abandoned hospital and a neglected Metro – within “The Gloom” and depicts them in unusual, but suitably horrendous ways. Whether its tentacles creeping through the walls, ghastly creatures lurking in the shadows, or buildings that could collapse at a moment’s notice, it’s anyone’s guess what’s around the next corner. At the heart of it all is Roman (voiced by Togo Igawa), a retired train driver who awakes to find himself dazed, bewildered, and haunted by all he can see.Alongside voice acting, Red Soul Games also use Motion Capture so that Roman’s facial reactions and movements feel natural and authentic, really bringing the character to life. The way he reacts to the horror all around him and processes this fantastical, wild world, really grounds Post Trauma. As a result, players will truly be able to see what Roman is thinking and feeling throughout the game. Much of the horror in Post Trauma comes from setting a scene and building tension rather than going in for quick jump scares. Post Trauma’s soundtrack plays an important role in this with moody piano solos softly building in the background while Roman moves along train tracks and corridors. Then during battles and confrontations, the beat kicks in to reach heart-pounding crescendos.  As you continue to explore the environment and uncover its secrets and inhabitants, it  will be important to pay close attention to every scenic detail as theymay hold clues to some of the game’s trickier puzzles. Perhaps a pad and paper could come in handy, too. The Gloom is a dangerous place , and there are times Roman will need to defend himself in life or death situations. Fortunately, there’s a variety of items at your disposal, like an all-powerful sledgehammer and a trusty crowbar. Roman will even find a pistol and a shotgun on his travels and can store them on his person or in chests found in safe spaces. Every little bit of room will help! As with all good Survival Horror games, though, this is a game that changes the questions just as you’re discovering the answers. We can’t wait for players to unearth its secrets when Post Trauma launches in 2025 for Xbox Series X|S. Wishlist it today! Post Trauma is a modern interpretation of genre-defining survival horror classics. As you venture deeper into the unknown, you’ll strive to solve the mysteries of your unfamiliar surroundings, hoping to discover hidden truths while trying to stay alive. Players will explore a terrifying, twisted reality that constantly unsettles as its story shifts and unravels. Fight or Flight? In Post Trauma, players control Roman (Togo Igawa), a tormented train conductor who awakes to find himself in a surreal dimension following a terrible panic attack. Faced with horrifying architecture and nightmarish abominations, Roman can choose to defend himself with an array of weapons or try to find the path of least resistance. A new world of horror that pays homage to the greats Inspired by key staples of the Survival Horror genre, Post Trauma blends fixed camera angles with stunning visuals through Unreal Engine 5 to create a truly unsettling, yet familiar horror experience. But just when you think you have the answers, this hellscape changes the questions as you enter the unknown to face your greatest fears. Can you find a way home? To survive this cruel world, you must piece together an ongoing mystery across several, seemingly unrelated settings. Deducing your environments to find unlikely hints and discovering precious tools in unexpected places will help you make continued progress. As you find clues and solve puzzles, you’ll gradually learn more about where you are and how you can escape, using a delicate mix of patience and cunning to stay alive. And maybe a pad and paper too. Built and enriched by world-class talent Featuring a fully voice acted cast (Togo Igawa, Autumn Ivy, Hyoie O’Grady) and a captivating, ambient audioscape, elevated by a hypnotic score from Nicolas Gasparini (Myuu), Post Trauma has been crafted to be a homage to beloved franchises and a new merging of playstyles. The intent is to create a truly special, unforgettable horror experience fuelled by pure passion and incredible talent.",
