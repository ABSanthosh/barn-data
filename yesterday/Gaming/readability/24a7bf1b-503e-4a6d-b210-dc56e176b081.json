  "text": "Season 02 arrives next week, upending the new order of Avalon. Engage with a massive amount of new content, including five Multiplayer maps, more than six new weapons, a new Zombies map, limited time Valentine’s Day-themed modes, and more. Gear up, train up, and deploy to Season 02 arriving Tuesday, January 28. The Hunter Becomes the Hunted: Black Ops 6 Season 02 is Here! Season 02 Overview: Nowhere to Run, Nowhere to Hide As Sevati “Sev” Dumas toasts a new era of Avalon, her short-lived victory over the Luttazzi crime family comes to an abrupt end. During a celebration in the French Syndicate Penthouse, an urgent notice arrives for all attendees: the Luttazzis have placed a lucrative bounty on the entire Rogue Team as payback. This is the price for working with criminals: In the dog-eat-dog world of Avalon, will money speak louder than loyalty? Now the Rogue Team is on the run, doggedly pursued by an anonymous and lethal assassin. Who can they really trust, and where can they hide? This season, the hunter becomes the hunted. Now’s the time to draw your line in the sand and bring in your targets and bounties… dead or alive. Gear up for a huge drop of free and premium content when Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6 Season 02 goes live on Tuesday, January 28 beginning at 9AM PT across all platforms. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6: Season 02 Five Maps: Deploy to three brand-new maps at Season 02 launch: Revel in the opulence of an Avalon crime boss’s penthouse in Bounty; turn high-end vehicle theft into black market gains in Dealership; and fight for your life on a stolen yacht in the Lifeline Strike map. Later in the season, board a high-speed train for revenge in the new Bullet Strike map, and catch some air with the return of Black Ops II’s Grind. New Modes and Valentine’s Day LTMs: Buff up your Operators by landing eliminations in Overdrive and test your skills across randomized Loadouts in Gun Game. For lovers and fighters, try your hand at Third Wheel Gunfight and Couples Dance Off. Additional Equipment: Broaden your tactical horizons with the new Slipstream Perk and War Machine Scorestreak, plus track down your next target with the Hunter’s Instinct Perk and replace your Dedicated Melee slot with a Launcher using the new Flyswatter Wildcard, both arriving in-season. Season 02 Ranked Play, Major I Announcement: Expect a new season of Multiplayer Ranked Play, with all-new rewards to earn. Plus, get info on the upcoming Major I Call of Duty League tournament! Multiplayer Maps Bounty (Launch) Brand-New, Core, 6v6, Medium-Sized Deploy at sunrise to the top of an Avalon skyscraper, surging into the penthouse suite of a local crime boss. The Rogue team are here to celebrate their previous victories, but the party is short-lived, as friends turn into enemies, and chaos reigns. From the starting point of a pristine Patio, move inside an opulent, gold-plated Nightclub and Lounge where top-shelf entertaining was provided to a variety of rich guests. Ambush enemies by jumping over the light fixtures hanging over the Lobby below. The party is in the front, but business is in the back; the rear Office is seemingly still under construction, but on closer inspection, this is the place where those displeasing the crime boss were tortured, as indicated by some particularly unpleasant evidence. Race over the tarp and battle between the unfinished walls or move out to the Rooftop for a tactical breath of fresh air. Shoot the glass out from underneath your enemy’s feet on the Skylight, or race along the outer Ledge, jumping over the top of a neon sight to reach the other side, as Bounty has plenty of routes to learn if you aren’t scared of heights. Dealership (Launch) Brand-New, Core, 6v6, Medium-Sized For Avalon’s wealthy clientele, nothing compares to the luxury vehicles on display at the Pallasar car dealership. However, this dealership is a front, and in reality serves as a lucrative black market for the criminal underworld where vehicles are traded for guns, ammunition, and other unsavory valuables. Rogue team flee Bounty, looking for friendly contacts in the vicinity, but are met with vicious retaliatory skrimishes at every turn. Battle around the wreckage in the Car Lot and Showroom, pushing the fight into the interior Commissary and Lounge or out on the Courtyard and once offered an idyllic vista. Open the sliding doors to either side of the Garage for a quick ambush or close them to stall incoming enemies. For the best sights over the Garage and Sales room, head into the Admin office and bounce between the two windows overlooking the areas, controlling the center of the map. For the ultimate element of surprise, equip the RC-XD and drive through the floor vent, exploding in the enemy’s face on the other side. Lifeline (Launch) Brand-New, Strike, 2v2/6v6, Small-Sized Expect high stakes on the high seas as Rogue team focus on escaping by boat, and battle onto the aptly named Lifeline, a small, high-end yacht still ablaze after a successful boarding by Sev and her allies. Currently chopping through the waves at high velocity, pursued by enemy gunboats, enemy evasion is certainly not guaranteed. This small-sized Strike map funnels Operators directly into the fight. Smoke billows from its flaming hardtop while the fight rages on below. From Bow to Aft, it won’t take long to collide in the center Bar and gambling den, the disco room, or along the steps on Portside and Starboard. Keep your head on a swivel or risk getting thrown overboard. Bullet (Mid-Season) Brand-New, Strike, 2v2/6v6, Small-Sized After regrouping and learning of the location of the Luttazzi Godmother – responsible for placing the bounty on the Rogue team in the first place – Sev and her team go on the offensive and drop onto the rapidly-moving bullet train to gain the upper hand, as well as neutralizing a key enemy target. This mid-season Strike map presses the fight up close along its narrow interior carriages. Race through the automatic sliding doors separating each car, from the first-class lounge through the dining car, second-class seats, and up to the cab where the fallen conductor dispels any hope of reaching the destination in one piece. When things get too hot inside, try your luck via a roof hatch up top; watch your step or risk being thrown from the train. Grind (Mid-Season) Remaster, Core, 6v6, Medium-Sized The infamous skatepark first introduced in Call of Duty: Black Ops II makes its Black Ops 6 debut in the mid-season! Shred your enemies across the indoor stadium and pro shop or soak up the sunshine in the huge skate bowl and halfpipe outdoors. Use the ramps for cover and to get above the competition and bust out your best tricks like the 360-corkscrew one-shot. Also expect an additional surprise related to this map, later in the season…. Multiplayer Modes A new Mode and a returning fan-favorite match type start the season off with a bang, in the days leading up to a new and enhanced Ranked Play later in the month. Overdrive (Brand New, Launch) Kick into Overdrive in this charged-up twist on Team Deathmatch. Teams compete to be the first to reach the maximum number of stars. Earn these stars by executing the following maneuvers: Earn 1 star for Basic Eliminations like finishing off an enemy with body shots. Earn 2 stars for Core Medal Eliminations like headshots and melee attacks. Earn 3 stars for completing Distinguished Medal Eliminations, reserved for only the most impressive takedowns. Rack up stars to unlock special Operator abilities that will greatly aid you in battle and keep that streak going to reach Overdrive! If you get eliminated, or the elimination timer runs out before you take out another target, you’ll start the process over again. Operators “attempting Overdrive” can expect the following improved capabilities: 1 Star: Awakened Senses: See enemies through walls and replenish your health after eliminating a target. 3 Stars: Physical Enhancements: Increased movement and reloading speed. 6 Stars: Augmented Handling: Improved hip-fire accuracy and improved sprint-to-fire and ADS speeds. Earn all three buffs to activate Overdrive! This allows you to earn double the stars when eliminating enemies. Gun Game (Launch) The fan-favorite Gun Game returns! Compete in a free-for-all mode where all Operators begin the match with the same starting weapon and cycle through the same set of 20 weapons, varying from match to match. Eliminate enemies to advance to the next weapon, testing your skills across a variety of weapon types. To keep the action moving, frequent radar sweeps reveal the last known location of all Operators on the map. The top two performing players and their current progress are also displayed on-screen. If someone starts pulling too far ahead, try taking them out with a melee attack to set them back to the previous weapon. The first Operator to cycle through all 20 weapons wins the match! Valentine’s Day Limited Time Modes Show your love with two limited-time modes for couples and third wheelers alike. Third Wheel Gunfight (In-Season) Not everyone’s hungry for love. Some people just want to do things their own way. In Third Wheel Gunfight, you can now bring along that untethered friend and duke it out 3v3. Couples Dance Off (In-Season) This one’s strictly for duos. Compete in a moshpit of 2v2 Face Off modes including Face Off Team Deathmatch, Face Off Domination, and Face Off Kill Confirmed. Additional Gameplay Content Enhance your tactical planning with two new Perks, a Wildcard and an even wilder Scorestreak, all coming to Season 02 Multiplayer. New Perks Perk: Slipstream (Event Reward) Perk Slot: 3 Type: Enforcer (Red) Raises your base sprint speed at the cost of removing Tac Sprint. Perk: Hunter’s Instinct (Mid-Season) Perk Slot: 2 Type: Enforcer (Red) Eliminating an enemy marks the next closest enemy. New Wildcard Wildcard: Flyswatter (In-Season) Allows a player to replace their Dedicated Melee weapon with a Launcher. New Scorestreak Scorestreak: War Machine (Event Reward) Type: Lethal Score: 1,300 Mastery Badges: Yes Powerful burst-fire grenade launcher with grenades that explode on impact. Large magazine. The deadly War Machine is back! This gives players the ability to launch explosive clusters into the enemy line for those with a penchant for heavier weapons. The War Machine comes equipped with 30 rounds, firing in three-round bursts. When you need to clear an area fast, there are few better options than this destructive armament. New Quality of Life Upgrades In addition to the new content coming on day one of Season 02, Treyarch has prioritized several quality of life improvements and playlist updates to release this Season, including: Access a Weapon Camo or Calling Card challenge and simply select “Add to Tracked” (in the bottom-left corner of your menu screen).

If you have fewer than 10 Calling Card Challenges or 10 Camo Challenges tracked, your nearest Challenges to completion will display in those slots instead. This should help players discover and identify Challenges they are close to completing. The top Tracked or Near Completion Calling Card Challenge and Camo Challenge both appear in the Lobby, as well as in-game via the Options Menu. Unique HUD Presets per mode (MP and Zombies) Players will be able to set the HUD Preset settings they prefer for both Multiplayer and Zombies, keeping a unique setup per-mode without needing to change settings when switching between modes. General Quality of Life updates Reduced collision with teammates to improve maneuverability around tight spaces and doorways with nearby teammates Weapon balance pass and bullet penetration updates Further reducing weapon motion when jumping, sliding, and diving with the Dexterity Perk equipped Improving player visibility in Kill Confirmed by reducing the height of dog tags on the map Simplifying and/or expanding requirements for several Calling Card Challenges, as well as fixing bugged Challenges Expanding the number of Featured Playlist slots to allow for more marquee playlists on the main menu For more details on updates to RICOCHET Anti-Cheat, Call of Duty: Warzone, Multiplayer, and Zombies, click here for the Community Update Blog.

Additional Gameplay Content: Keep all threats in sight with the addition of the Death Perception Perk, including new Augments to research to further enhance its abilities.

New Quality of Life Updates: Co-op Pause, Challenge Tracking, Bespoke HUD Preset settings, and more are coming to Season 02. The Tomb (Launch) Following the events at Citadelle des Morts, Weaver, Maya, Carver, and Grey must take the amulet secured at the Citadel to a cursed dig site and the ancient catacombs within. Professor Krafft indicated that the elusive Sentinel Artifact may be found in the tunnels below. Reports of paranormal phenomena go back centuries, possibly related to the presence of the artifact. If the team can secure it, there may yet be hope in releasing Samantha Maxis from her imprisonment in the Dark Aether. In this enthralling new adventure, follow in the footsteps of a doomed explorer and explore a long-forgotten dig site while seeking out a door to nowhere. What lurks behind this door? You’ll find out when brand-new Zombies map launches at the start of Season 02 on Tuesday, January 28, at 9AM PT. Echoes in the Dark: Your Comms Team Handlers “A shiny ha’penny to the lucky blighter who finds that door first!” - Sir Archibald Fotherington-Smythe You’ll need all the guidance you can get to navigate the dark and dusty passages of the cursed catacombs within this Romanesque dig site. Aiding you on this adventure is S.A.M., Ravenov, Peck, as well as Raptor One and the increasingly erratic Strauss. Adding to the oddities are reports of audible anomalies in the form of echoes of a former British explorer who led an ill-fated 1908 expedition into the earthworks. The Tomb: Initial Recon Tour Bolster your knowledge of The Tomb before attempting to survive its many dangers with this abridged and narrative-focused overview of its main locations. What of the Tomb’s many secrets? These are left for you to discover! Dig Site The surface-level Dig Site is your entryway to the rest of the map. Strange glowing runes mark certain alcoves, perhaps gateways to the subterranean regions beyond. A large, partially uncovered stone face lies at the pit of the site, roped off and long forgotten, a nearby fallen pillar. Scale the stairs and scaffolding to further explore the area. Don’t linger too long, lest you end up like the headless statue on the upper tiers of this archeological area. Neolithic Catacombs and Ossuary Exploring the Neolithic Catacombs, you may notice how far back the area goes, both physically as well as through layers of ancient cultures and civilizations. Cave paintings adorn the cavernous walls, while winding pathways lead through the natural hollows of the earth. In the Ossuary, stacked with the skulls of the long dead, the cavern gives way to the stone architecture of a later age, its bone piles and altars lending an ominous presence throughout. Tombs Statues of ancient warriors line the Tombs in alcoves along the walls along with depictions of shielded hoplites engaging a charging bull. Though the vault has long crumbled into disarray, the remnants of pristine architecture are on clear display, illuminated through the patch of sunlight falling through a crumbled hole in the ceiling. Shrine of the Hierophants Ancient priests charged with interpreting the sacred mysteries, the hierophants seem to have uncovered more than they were bargaining for. The candlelit, vaulted ceiling marks the resting place of important figures, a frieze sculpted into the wall showing a fierce battle between opposing forces. Arrow Trap installations line the stairway down into the shrine, flanked by skulls on chain pullies. Subterranean Temple and Deep Excavation Descend into the catacombs to reveal the huge, cavernous Subterranean Temple, where the stone architecture leads downward to a rocky outcropping peninsula known as the Deep Excavation. Scattered pillars encircle a place of worship below, the murky depths illuminated via faint shafts of what appears to be sunlight entering from a natural space in the rock above. Doorway to Nowhere and Dark Aether Nexus Take your expedition deeper still, seek out the Doorway to Nowhere, and [[REDACTED]]. [[REDACTED]] [[REDACTED]] [[REDACTED]] [[REDACTED]]. [[REDACTED]] [[REDACTED]] [[REDACTED]] [[REDACTED]]. [[REDACTED]] [[REDACTED]] [[REDACTED]] [[REDACTED]] [[REDACTED]]. [[REDACTED]] [[REDACTED]] [[REDACTED]] [[REDACTED]]. [[REDACTED]] [[REDACTED]] [[REDACTED]] [[REDACTED]].  New Enemy Sighted: Shock Mimic Often disguising themselves as useful items, these shocking creatures break out of the illusion on approach, grabbing victims with their tentacles and razor-sharp claws, pulling them in for an electrifying bite. This hits harder than expected, and the distortion camouflage the Shock Mimic emits disrupts your radar as well as your eyesight. Other Entities of The Tomb The inhabitants of The Tomb represent a swath of laborers, worshipers, and armored guards from eons past, heavily rotted, some mummified, and many with a more skeletal appearance than previously encountered undead. Alongside the familiar enemies you’re bound to encounter throughout, these ancient undead reveal the importance of the site. But what they were digging up, and perhaps more ominously, who or what they came to worship, remains to be discovered. New Wonder Weapon: Staff of Ice This masterpiece of ancient technology fires a withering blast of frost and can generate healing energies to resuscitate allies from a distance. Origins unknown. Rumors of a magical staff promise exceptional power to anyone who can get their hands on the devastating weapon. Known as the Staff of Ice, this offers an exceptional blast that can slow and freeze enemies in place, as well as a more devastating area-of-effect attack. This archaic Wonder Weapon is also imbued with the power to revive teammates with a precision-shot restorative blast. The Tomb: Additional Content Main Quest and Quest Rewards: The Main Quest for The Tomb goes live when the map releases alongside the launch of Season 02 on January 28. Complete the Main Quest to earn the “X91 Ice-Pike” Wonder Weapon Skin — a Project Janus facsimile of the “Staff of Ice” — as well as 5,000 XP and a unique Calling Card awarded to players who complete the Main Quest before Directed Mode is released for The Tomb. Arrow Trap: Got a horde of zombies on your back? Activate the Arrow Trap to send out darts of damaging energy from the wall, devastating its targets on contact. If you need to backtrack, run and slide to avoid getting shot by your own trap. Aetheric Lanterns: Dark Aether chandeliers and light sources give off a pale glow over their surroundings. With the correct projectile and aiming confidence, you can use these dynamic hazards to rain down Aetheric fire, damaging anything that shambles through the flames. And More: Dig deeper into the lore of the ancient site with Intel in the form of Audio Logs, Documents, and Artifacts to discover while exploring the map. New Gameplay Content Access the following new content within The Tomb as well as on Citadelle des Morts, Terminus, and Liberty Falls. Additional Perk-a-Cola: Death Perception Available: In-Game at Perk Machine Returning since its original introduction in Black Ops 4, Death Perception gives players the ability to detect enemies through obstacles and walls via outlines of their bodies, plus new abilities for its Black Ops 6 debut. When navigating the tight confines of The Tomb, there’s no better Perk for anticipating danger around the next corner. Research its Augments to further empower Death Perception, ensuring that nothing escapes your notice! Death Perception is available within The Tomb, along with the nine previously accessible Zombies Perks. Note that some of these Perks are only available via a Der Wunderfizz machine. Death Perception is available on Citadelle des Morts, Liberty Falls and Terminus maps via the Der Wunderfizz machine.

Additional Support Weapon: War Machine Salvage: 2,500 Give the undead an explosive taste of their own entrails with the semi-automatic War Machine grenade launcher arriving in the Support section of the Crafting Table. The Tomb: Directed Mode and Events For the explorers who need an extra hand in completing the Main Quest on The Tomb, stay tuned for the arrival of Directed Mode planned to arrive at Mid-Season. Look for more announcements in the mid-season update, including a special Limited Time Mode you won’t want to miss.

Full-auto submachine gun. Fast fire rate with impressive damage and high recoil. Moderate handling. Make mincemeat out of the competition with the return of the fan-favorite World War II era PPSh-41 SMG, boasting an incredibly fast fire rate that makes short work of enemies at close range. Tame its unpredictable recoil by firing in bursts or empty the whole clip in hip-fire engagements. Consider the Extended Mag, Assault Pack Field Upgrade, or the Scavenger Perk to keep from running dry in long fights and keep pushing forward maximize your damage. Primary Weapon: Cypher 091 (Launch) Assault Rifle, Battle Pass Page 8 HVT Tier Reward, Page 11 Battle Pass Blueprint Levels: 42 MAGS: 3 MAG SIZE: 30 Mastery Badges: Yes Attachments: Optic, Barrel, Underbarrel, Magazine, Rear Grip, Stock, Laser, Fire Mods Customize Options: Skins, Reticle Unlocks (MP, ZM, WZ), Accessories (1), Decals (1), Stickers (3) Full-auto assault rifle. Slower rate of fire balanced by great handling and excellent mobility. For versatility, few weapons outshine the Cypher 091. With excellent range, handling, and mobility, the weapon performs well in a variety of engagements. With clear front mounted iron sights, minimal muzzle smoke, and controllable recoil, this AR makes for easy target acquisition even without an attached Optic. To top it off, its fast reload speed reduces downtime between mags, getting you straight back into the fight. Primary Weapon: Feng 82 (Launch) LMG, Battle Pass Page 3 HVT Tier Reward, Page 10 Battle Pass Blueprint Levels: 48 MAGS: 5 MAG SIZE: 30 Mastery Badges: Yes Attachments: Optic, Muzzle, Barrel, Underbarrel, Magazine, Rear Grip, Stock, Laser, Fire Mods Customize Options: Skins, Reticle Unlocks (MP, ZM, WZ), Accessories (1), Decals (1), Stickers (3) Full-auto light machine gun.

Possessing the best accuracy and handling in its class, the Feng 82 LMG offers a more aggressive, frontline option for players looking to stay in the thick of the fight without losing the LMG firepower expected of the weapon type.
