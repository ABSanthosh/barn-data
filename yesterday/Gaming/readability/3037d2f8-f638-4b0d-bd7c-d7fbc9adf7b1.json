I’m particularly stoked to see that our favorite gaming headset, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless, is down to its lowest price ever. But if you’re after something a little more budget-friendly, the JBL Quantum 200 gaming headset is 50% off.

JBL Quantum 200JBL Quantum 200The JBL Quantum 200 is a great budget gaming headset with a starting price of just $60, and a limited-time deal cuts that number in half. This over-ear offering is comfortable on head with a lightweight build and plush earcups. The 50mm drivers pump out a realistic soundstage, putting you at the center of the action, while the boom mic does a decent job of focusing on your voice. Since the headset is wired, its 3.5mm jack makes for nearly universal compatibility, letting you play on any platform. SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro WirelessSteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro WirelessWhile the JBL Quantum 200 may be budget-friendly, our top gaming headset of 2025 has dropped to its lowest price ever. Both the PlayStation and Xbox versions of the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless are under $230, delivering unbelievable sound quality, a clear mic, and an extremely comfortable fit. But what makes this headset a true standout is its battery system and base station. You’ll never be without a charge using this wireless headset, thanks to the two included hot-swappable batteries. Plus, the base station makes adjusting volume, turning on active noise cancellation, and more a breeze.

When you want to turn it off, on, or adjust the settings, a handy remote control lets you control it from across the room. A night mode also makes this already quiet fan even quieter for a restful sleep. Plus, it’s a Dyson, so you know the longevity of this machine, making for a sound investmentSecretlab Titan EvoSecretlab Titan EvoEnjoy up to $139 off gaming chairs, desks, and more during Secretlab’s Memorial Day sale. The Titan Evo, which held the top spot on our best gaming chair guide for years (only to be dethroned by the Titan Evo Nanogen), is part of the deal, dropping the seat’s price by 22%. There are plenty of reasons to love this chair; the build quality is impeccable, the ergonomics are next level, and the unique design features add even more comfort. If you’ve been waiting to buy a gaming chair, now is a great time to invest. Below are some other great deals from Secretlab taking place throughout the Memorial Day weekend. LEAPUL 21V Cordless Electric Leaf Blower LEAPUL 21V Cordless Electric Leaf Blower Summer is here, and so is the yard work.
