  "text": "Image credit: Fireproof Games Ghost Town - the spooky, 80s-set VR puzzle-adventure from the studio behind the acclaimed The Room series - is a genuine treat, and one that's poised to shake off its former Meta Quest exclusivity very soon. Developer Fireproof Games has announced Ghost Town's paranormal delights will be available on PC via Steam VR from next Tuesday, 15th July. Ghost Town whisks players back to the London of 1983, where protagonist Edith Penrose - who runs a paranormal detective agency halfway up a South London council block with her tech savvy flatmate Rina - is attempting to find her missing brother, Adam. The ensuing urban fantasy adventure takes players first to a remote Scottish island and then around various immaculately realised London locales, which I won't spoil here. It's fantastic stuff, full of clever puzzling, satisfyingly tactile environmental interactions (if you love The Room series, you'll feel right at home here), and just a brilliantly cinematic approach to its storytelling as Ghost Town leaps through time and its wonderfully orchestrated set-pieces. There's a bit in a lighthouse that might be one of my favourite gaming moments this year! It helps, too, that its small cast of characters is brought to life by some stellar performances. Ghost Town | Launch Trailer | Meta Quest Platform Here's Ghost Town's Meta Quest trailer.Watch on YouTube Ghost Town originally launched for Meta Quest (amid plenty of critical acclaim) back in April, with Fireproof promising a PC VR and PSVR 2 release would follow at a later date. There's still no update on that PlayStation VR 2 version, but the studio has now confirmed Ghost Town is coming to Steam VR in just a few days time, on 15th July. It's unclear if Ghost Town's PC release will bring any improvements to take advantage of the potentially beefier hardware at players' disposal, but I've asked Fireproof and will report back if I hear anything. Until then, you can wishlist Ghost Town now, and a demo's available too.",
