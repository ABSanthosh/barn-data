  "text": "Even rare discounts on first-party games. It’s official: Nintendo’s Black Friday sale is live, offering dozens of hot new deals on consoles, games, and accessories. While the Nintendo eShop has its own digital game sale underway, some of the best Switch games have reached lower prices at select retailers like Best Buy, GameStop, Target, and Walmart. This year’s lineup of game discounts is one of the best I've seen, featuring major price cuts to popular Switch titles that typically cost upwards of $50 at any other time of the year (looking at you, Zelda). We’re here to help you find the best picks for Nintendo's handheld while holiday shopping on a budget. Here's 10 Switch games under $30, and another 10 Switch games under $20 (be warned: These Black Friday deals sell out fast). The Best Switch Game Deal, Period - Tears of the Kingdom for $30The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the KingdomIf you're in a pinch and just want a straight answer about the best Black Friday game deal, look no further than Tears of the Kingdom for $30. Usually retailing for a full $69.99, this 56% discount from Walmart is an unprecedented deal for a first-party Nintendo game, let alone one of the best games ever. Keep in mind, this deal is limited to the digital version (but is $20 cheaper than the deal available in the eShop). 9 More Switch Games Under $30: The Best Switch Game Under $20 - Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1This might kind of be cheating, but if you want the most bang for your buck, Konami's Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 is over 50% off, making it my top pick for the best Switch game under $20 right now. If you recently finished Metaphor and want to check out more Atlus games, Persona 5 Royal is down to $15, or check out the Special Edition of a fellow Game of the Year nominee: Balatro. 9 More Switch Games Under $20: Unbeatable Nintendo Black Friday Deals Are Now LiveLooking to break the bank a little more? Nintendo has got you covered. This year, the company introduced its best-ever prices for the Switch OLED bundle at $274.99 and the standard Switch bundle at $224.99. Both bundles are competitively priced, considering they come with a digital copy of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (which has a typical retail value of $59.99) and a 12-month subscription to Nintendo Switch Online. Though the long-awaited announcement of a Switch 2 looms in the distance, this deal is pretty unbeatable if you’re looking for a reason to get into the world of Switch gaming or you’re a current Switch owner who's been waiting for the right time to upgrade to the OLED model. Those who purchase will save a total of $155 as opposed to purchasing the console, year-long NSO subscription and video game separately.This Black Friday is also a great opportunity to stock up on some new controllers in preparation for a holiday season filled with multiplayer gaming sessions. Gamers can purchase the red and blue wireless Joy-Con controllers for 25% off at Target or get a hold of a pro controller for $49.99 at Best Buy.And if you’re planning on taking advantage of Walmart’s $30 Tears of the Kingdom deal, you’d be remiss to disregard Amazon’s abundant deals on memory cards. A regular Nintendo Switch holds only 32GB of internal storage, and the Legend of Zelda entry takes up about half of that space. But don’t fret! With Amazon’s nearly half off discount on the Lexar 1TB PLAY microSDXC memory card, you can ensure you have room to download all of your favorite games without spending a small fortune.When Is Black Friday 2024?Black Friday actually starts on November 29, but deals have been popping up over the last few weeks. In Nintendo’s case, some games saw price cuts as early as the first of the month, but November 24 was when many of the company’s top-selling items received big discounts at retailers. If you’re looking to expand your game library, now is the time to do so, with many popular titles being sold at the lowest price of the year.If you’re not a Switch gamer, there’s plenty of other video game deals to take advantage of this holiday season for PlayStation and Xbox.
