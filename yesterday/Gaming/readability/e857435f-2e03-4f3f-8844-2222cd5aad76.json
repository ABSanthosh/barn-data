  "text": "GHUNTER sees you helping a gnome with some cooking. Except all of your meals are alive and put up a fight. I have played a large number of cooking games in my life, but none have ever had cooking in the same way that this game requires you to. You work as a cooking gnome that needs to create food for a local tavern, but cooking isn’t actually done in the tavern at all. Here, you are actually cooking your prey alive through setting traps and killing them using specific methods, creating a dish as they die. You do need to finish off all of the enemies the same way, though – using your melee weapon. Your main weapon actually needs ammo (which is found when hunting your prey), and loading up your weapon will change how your prey is cooked. You can also set traps and otherwise work the prey down to low health before slicing them up into a dish. If you aren’t careful or just don’t want to deal with a specific enemy, you can actually fully kill them, though. You’re going to need to pay attention for this reason, and also because there are also different enemies out in the field and you will be looking for specific ones to eat. If you track down the right foe and do things right, you will also need to follow a sort of reaction-based final cut that will create the dish. There’s a lot of steps to cooking something alive. These dishes are then sold at the local tavern where you can talk to customers and move forward through a story about the place. The tavern is also where you can upgrade your character and get new orders, so you will be returning there often to reset and update your weapons. GHUNTER is a very unique and interesting game. It’s got such a different and intense way of cooking, while also being quite silly in nature. I got the chance to play it at Bilbao Games Conference where I had a fun time trying to find the perfect prey for my dishes. GHUNTER is available now (for free) on Steam.
