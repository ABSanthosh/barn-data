  "text": "SummaryUnleash chaos across three worlds as part of a greater cosmic storm.Discover the hidden connections between three DCF games as you challenge fate itself.Fight for blood, blaze through a crime-fueled bullet hell, and defend an alien kingdom. At first glance, Bunny Battle Nemesis, Tony and Clyde, and Cruz Brothers may seem like three wildly different games. A futuristic war waged by alien rabbits, a crime-fueled bullet hell, and a brutal fight circuit where warriors fight for blood. But in the DCF Universe, nothing happens in isolation. The smallest spark can send shockwaves across worlds. A trickster god’s prank, a heist gone wrong, and a fighter chasing glory in the Pride Fists tournament. It twists fate in ways no one could predict. And now, in the Triple Trouble Bundle, you are at the center of this storm. And this storm is not just about stabs, slashes, jabs, blasts, and empty clips. Broken noses, flying teeth, and shattered ribs. It is about more than just blood splats, shotgun blasts, and smashed bottles. High-speed chases, bank heists, and last-second dodges. And it’s much more than the smell of gunpowder burned in the morning mixed with sweat, blood, and tears. The DCF Universe goes beyond all the violence and the endless struggle for survival. It is about proving one’s worth in the eyes of the Allfather, Orochi. As the creator of existence, Orochi established that only those warriors who embody honor, courage, and perseverance may enter his realm and cross the gates of Valhalla. But this is not just a myth buried in this cosmic lore. It is something players can unravel firsthand in Cruz Brothers, the first game released from the DCF Universe. Through the in-game collectible DCFU Cards, players unlock fragments of the universe’s secrets, revealing how Orochi and the Creator Gods gave birth to existence and, eventually, to the homo sapiens. Creator Gods? Sounds a bit over the top, right? But don’t worry, you will be seeing them all over this bundle. They have been heating things up since Cruz Brothers and now they are causing even more trouble in Bunny Battle Nemesis. Legends say that one morning, Loki Orochison woke up and thought, “What a laugh we’d have if I freed one of my sister’s Maidens and sent her off to cause some chaos? Too right, mate?” But let’s just say, the Leporidae are not laughing. And that Maiden was Amanda. Once a prisoner among the Maidens, now, she has invaded the Leporidae Kingdom. Not to thank Loki for his trickery, but to take revenge on the one who bound her in chains, the Goddess of Death, Hell Ella, by striking at her beloved children, the Leporidae, on their own planet. Now, the Leporidae warriors are fighting for their survival, standing against Amanda and her Mamba Rangers who threaten their home planet. And you, as the player, will be their guiding hand on the battlefield of Bunny Battle Nemesis. You can also fight back by stepping into the shoes of Valentina, another of Hell Ella’s Maidens. But unlike Amanda, she has not gone rogue. In fact, she is deeply grateful to Hell Ella for saving her from a cruel fate, one that played out far from the Leporidae Kingdom, in a world of outlaws, chaos, and relentless gunfights in Tony and Clyde. You see, in the DCF Universe, nothing happens in isolation. The Triple Trouble Bundle isn’t just a collection of games, it is three different perspectives on a storm of chaos. A fighter proving their worth in the Pride Fists tournament, outlaws carving their own path in a crime-fueled bullet hell, and an alien kingdom resisting a war sparked by a trickster god. Each battle is a challenge against fate itself. Are you ready to face the storm? The DCF Universe Triple Trouble Bundle is available now on Xbox. DCF Universe Triple Trouble Bundle One purchase. Three explosive experiences. Are you ready for trouble? Step into the DCF Universe, where chaos reigns, battles never end, and every fight is part of something bigger. Take on intergalactic war in Bunny Battle Nemesis, unleash pure outlaw mayhem in Tony and Clyde, and rise as a legend in the brutal arenas of Cruz Brothers. Three games, one connected universe filled with action, attitude, and unstoppable madness. Suit up, lock and load, and let the trouble begin!",
