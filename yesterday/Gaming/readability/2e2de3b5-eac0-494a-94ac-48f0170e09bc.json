  "text": "Image credit: Universal Pictures Photos purportedly taken on the set of Five Nights at Freddy's 2 have leaked online, including shots of an ominously dilapidated Freddy Fazbear pizzeria. Universal Pictures and Blumhouse Productions announced the sequel back in April last year, but we've learned very little since then, making these pictures - which include a rusty sign of the toy animatronics Freddy, Bonnie, and my girl Chica - particularly exciting for some. It's still unclear if the upcoming movie will be faithful to the second game's prequel timeline which takes place in the late 1980s. Let's Play Five Nights At Freddy's - Late To The Party Let's Play Five Nights At Freddy's - Late To The Party.Watch on YouTube A fan has also allegedly spotted \"some FNAF merch being sold for a possible scene\" in the sequel, too. Whilst not remotely official - so take all this with a healthy dollop of salt - these photos were reportedly taken in River Town, outside of New Orleans. Whilst the OP originally thought it little more than \"a little [local] fair\" and nothing special, they later saw signs indicating that the area would be closed to the public by 3pm, and then signs for \"Extras\" and \"a bunch of trailers\".

He talked about \"higher stakes\" and hinted that there will be \"more\" and \"different\" animatronics, with the Freddy universe \"opening up in a big way\". On its release, Five Nights at Freddy's scored the second-largest debut of all time for a video game adaptation in the US, coming only behind that of Nintendo and Illumination's animated Super Mario Bros. Movie.",
