In fact, right now it's the exact same price as the lesser 20,000mAh model. This is the successor to the Anker 737 that we deemed the best Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally charger. This power bank features a massive 27,650mAh and power delivery up to 250W. Very few power banks at this price can match that output; it can even charge the newest Apple MacBook Pro 16\" laptop.Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank for $129.99With 250W of USB Type-C Power DeliveryAnker Prime 27,650mAh 250W USB Power BankThe Anker Prime is a hefty power bank, measuring 6.4\"x2\"x2.2\" and weighing in at 1.5lbs. This is something you'd put in your travel bag or backpack instead of your pocket. It has two USB Type-C ports and one USB Type-A port. The USB Type-A port supports up to 65W, although it drops to 18W if you're using the other ports at the same time. Each USB Type C port supports up to 140W of Power Delivery (or a combined total of 240W if you're running both simultaneously). That's powerful enough to charge even the current 2024 Apple MacBook Pro 16\" laptop, which accepts up to 140W of charging. In terms of gaming handhelds, the Steam Deck supports up to 38W of charging, the Asus ROG Ally up to 65W, and the Nintendo Switch up to 18W. Basically, that means the Anker Prime can easily charge all three gaming handhelds at their maximum rate (all at the same time even, if you own all three); you'll even be able to play and charge simultaneously.A 27.650mAh battery equates to a 99.5Whr capacity. An 80% power efficiency rating (which is about standard for power banks) gives you about 80Whr of available charge. Both the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally consume about 40Whr. The Nintendo Switch consumes about 16Whr. That means this power bank will charge a Steam Deck or ROG Ally from empty to completely full two times. It can recharge a Nintendo Switch about five times. A MacBook Pro 16\" is equipped with a 100Whr battery, so it can be charged to about 80% capacity.The Anker Prime is TSA-approved, but just barely.TSA states that power banks must be under 100Whr in capacity for carry-on (check-in is not allowed under any circumstances). This Anker Prime is just barely under that at 99.5Whr, but that is the nominal rating and in real-world testing, it will always be below that. You might get checked simply because the Prime 27,650mAh is a hefty-looking power bank, but you shouldn't have any problems getting it cleared.This is one of the best Steam Deck deals and Nintendo Switch deals available right now, and absolutely worth considering if you find yourself short on power all too often. However, not everyone needs that much capacity or power and would instead benefit more from a smaller, slimmer, and less expensive power bank that might even be able to fit easily in your pocket. If you fit that bill, then check out these best power banks for travel.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
