  "text": "Image credit: Cortopia Studios The heroes in a half shell are back, and this time they're pressing right up against your eyeballs. That's thanks to their debut VR outing, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Empire City, which is coming to Meta Quest 3 and SteamVR sometime next year. Empire City is the work of Cortopia Studios - which co-developed last year's well-received gladiatorial bludgeon-'em-up Gorn 2 - and follows Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, and Michelangelo in an action-adventure set on (and presumably under) the Foot Clan-infested streets of New York City following Shredder's demise. It's an adventure described as \"equal parts hard-hitting combat and an exploration of the bonds of brotherhood\", and there's talk of \"fluid parkour\" as players - and up to three friends - scale the urban landscape. Fan-favourite villains are also promised, all readying for a walloping - in battles built around strikes and blocks - with each turtle's signature weapon.

The teaser trailer above isn't much more informative, but you'll find a handful of screenshots over on Steam. Expect more details in the run up to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Empire City's Steam VR and Meta Quest release in 2026. It's been busy few years for the Turtles, of course; following 2022's brilliant beat-'em-up Shredder's Revenge and acclaimed 2023 movie outing Mutant Mayhem, last year brought the fairly middling Mutants Unleashed and rogue-like Splintered Fate. Strange Scaffold took on the series earlier this month, nudging it into turn-based strategy territory with Tactical Takedown, and it's already been confirmed more games - including the God of War-inspired The Last Ronin - are on the way. As a scaly green youth once put it, \"Totally tubular, dude!\"",
