  "text": "\"Industry conditions have forced us into a tricky spot.\" Image credit: Cyan Riven developer Cyan Worlds has cut its staff count by half. In a statement posted to social media, the Washington studio - perhaps best known for the Myst series - said \"despite its best efforts\", \"industry conditions\" had forced it into a \"tricky spot [where] the month-to-month realities of game development in 2025\" left it with no choice but to lay off half its team. Newscast: Xbox currently has more first-party games coming to PlayStation 5 this year than Sony Xbox currently has more first-party games coming to PlayStation 5 this year than Sony.Watch on YouTube \"Today we would like to share with you some very unfortunate news,\" the statement began. \"Despite our best efforts to avoid it, Cyan has made the difficult decision to reduce our overall staff size - resulting in the layoff of 12 talented staff members, roughly half the team - effective at the end of March. \"Industry conditions have forced us into a tricky spot where we are having to weigh the future health of our studio against the month-to-month realities of game development in 2025. Throughout the past year, we have been ultra-transparent with the entire Cyan team about the choppy waters we find ourselves in, as well as the dangers ahead. While the news of a layoff was not a surprise to the team, it was (and is) still deeply saddening for all of us.\" The studio said it has \"done [its] best to pad the landing for those affected\" with severance packages and is now committed to securing funding for its next project to \"restabilise\" the studio. \"We've been around for a very long time, and have been through tough times before,\" the statement concluded. \"Our sincere hope is to continue to be around, and to provide the types of experiences that only Cyan can deliver.\" At the end of last week, Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics similarly made the \"difficult decision\" to layoff 17 \"talented\" staff. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, 1200 game developers have lost their jobs, on top of around 14,600 in 2024, and 10,500 in 2023.",
