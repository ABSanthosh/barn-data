  "text": "From on-track Ray Tracing to unprecedented detail with 8K, discover how EA Sports and Codemasters utilize the groundbreaking PS5 Pro technology to make F1 24 look and play better. Si Lumb, Technical Producer at Codemasters, shares insight into what players can expect when playing F1 24 on PS5 Pro — plus, more details about Season 4 and an upcoming Free-Play trial. Enhanced for PS5 Pro, F1 24 takes full advantage of the console’s exclusive technologies and improved graphical capabilities depending on the display option players choose in the settings menu. “PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) allows us to push a Ray Traced image to 4K without sacrificing image quality in Quality Mode,” says Si. “The increased power in the PS5 Pro’s GPU gives us the ability to double the 120Hz resolution in Performance Mode, and with some clever re-ordering of the frame, we have even managed to put the 32 Million pixels of 8K at 60Hz in Resolution Mode.” Whilst Ray Tracing is available on PS5 in F1 24 race replays, the power of the PS5 Pro enables this technology during on-track racing when selecting Quality Mode.“Ray Tracing allows us to simulate light to enhance realism, making reflections, shadows, and lighting more lifelike. These enhancements result in a more photorealistic experience, especially on the glossy and mirror-like chassis of the cars, the undulating and detailed track terrain, or the varied circuit surroundings. This is even more prominent in wet conditions, where reflections from puddles or shiny surfaces play a significant role in the immersion.” In a first for EA Sports, the PS5 Pro F1 24 enhancements enable 8K/60Hz support when using a compatible display in Resolution Mode. All 25 circuits in the game are improved both on and off the track, and with variable weather and time of day options for each, players are bound to discover a new favorite in 8K/60Hz. “For the ultimate showcase of 8K visuals, I’d recommend Spa Francorchamps at sunset in clear weather. The elevation changes and dense foliage at Spa, combined with the incredible detail and depth offered by 8K, make for a visually stunning experience. The track’s sweeping corners and long straights will show off the high pixel count, while the dynamic lighting and shadows give you a real sense of immersion as the light shifts across the circuit.”  By leveraging the power of the PS5 Pro to work in harmony with F1 24’s EGO Engine, the development team plans to push the limits of graphical performance for future releases. “We’ve learned a lot from this release, and the groundwork laid in F1 24 will help us take even greater advantage of the PS5 Pro’s power in the future. We’re especially interested in expanding our use of technologies like PSSR across more modes and further optimizing our Ray Tracing and high frame rate features. As we continue to push the limits of the EGO engine, we look forward to delivering even more groundbreaking advancements in upcoming F1 titles.” No matter which graphical mode players choose, the PS5 Pro enhancements result in noticeable differences throughout the game when you load up F1 24 for the first time. “Whether it’s increased clarity in the Performance Mode, the sharper details and more immersive visuals of our new 8K Resolution Mode, or the dramatic improvements to lighting and reflections—thanks to Ray Tracing—in Quality Mode, each adds to the realism, immersion, and scale in bringing the sport of F1 to life on your screen.”  For F1 24’s Season 4, players across all PlayStation platforms can race to unlock a number of new customization items, with one such item being fit for a champion. Plus, a new Pro Challenge at Austin’s Circuit of the Americas featuring Oscar Piastri, and a selection of Race Scenarios, including a pair from Abu Dhabi 2021, each with rewards usable throughout the game. Keep an eye out for the full reveal on November 19. For those yet to pick up F1 24, there’s no better time, as from November 21-24, F1 24 will be free to download and play, with the opportunity to test drive the entire game, including its PS5 Pro features alongside a double XP period for Podium Pass. Everything from the revamped Career mode through to the thrilling multiplayer will be available, with all progress made carrying over to the full game. Trending Stories",
