  "text": "Bandai Namco dropped a trailer Friday for (deep breath) new Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot downloadable content, Daima - Adventure Through The Demon Realm Part 1 arriving July 17. More importantly, it revealed what players can expect from their adventure to the Demon Realm.The trailer isn’t even a minute long, but it included enough hints to let players know it’ll focus on the first half of the 20-episode anime Dragon Ball Daima. In terms of characters, only Glorio, Shin, Panzy, and Goku (obviously) are featured. The minotaur Goku and Glorio spook in the show, and some Gendarmerie soldiers, also make an appearance.What’s perhaps most notable is what didn’t make the cut for the trailer — namely, all the cool stuff that happens in the second half of Daima, like Vegeta’s Super Saiyan 3 transformation and Goku’s new form, which I won’t spoil for you in case you’re waiting for the English dub to wrap up. Much like with Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero’s Daima DLC, it seems like the the content fans are most eager for won’t arrive until the game’s second Daima DLC arrives — whenever that is. No Tamagami showed up in the trailer, meaning Goku’s fight against Tamagami 3 may or may not be included in the first DLC.Interestingly, the trailer — posted to Bandai Namco’s American YouTube channel — includes Japanese voices, like the Daima characters in Sparking! Zero. It seems like the DLC will be released in Japanese, so hopefully an English dub arrives sooner rather than later, though there hasn’t been any official word yet. Dragon Ball Daima’s English dub is still releasing on Crunchyroll, and will be wrapped up a few weeks from now.Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot will also get a new physical edition that includes a download code for the Daima DLC, for PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch. It’ll be released on July 18 for $49.99. The trailer, as well as the box art, notes the Switch version will include A New Power Awakens, previously released DLC with content from early Dragon Ball Super like the Super Saiyan God and Super Saiyan Blue transformations for Goku and Vegeta, but it is not included in the PS5 version.",
