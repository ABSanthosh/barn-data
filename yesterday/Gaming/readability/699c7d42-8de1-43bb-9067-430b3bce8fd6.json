  "text": "Get ready to add Rockbeasts, the narrative band-management RPG, to your most anticipated albums of 2025. Welcome to a world that puts you in the shoes of a manager in the age of MTV, rock anthems, and bad haircuts. Featuring the iconic Iggy Pop and with a story written by Jakub Szamałek (Senior writer of The Witcher 3, Principal Writer of Cyberpunk 2077 and the upcoming The Blood of Dawnwalker), prepare for a tragicomic tale of the highs and lows of an up-and-coming band in the 90s. As the manager of “one of the most controversial bands” of the era, you’ll help a group of rising stars as they navigate the highs and lows of the music industry in pursuit of fame and fortune. Along the way, you’ll meet a colorful cast of anthropomorphic animals, some inspired by real world rock legends. Pick the venue, prep the set and make sure it all goes according to plan. Pull it off and the band might just finally take those first steps to fame and glory. Sure, this one was in a grimy basement, but even the rock legends had to start somewhere, right? The characters that bring this world to life all come with their own motivations, and personal demons. You have a choice – will you be the manager who helps those around you, or uses others as the stepping stone to success? Bringing the Godfather of Punk himself, Iggy Pop, to your television screens once again, has drawn on decades of musical insider knowledge for his performance to give you an authentic window into the world of early ’90s rock mayhem. His musical performances live in the annals of rock music history and now he’s jumping over to your Xbox. Iggy Pop plays a fictionalised version of himself, the aptly named “Iggy Pup” and lends his vocal talents to bringing the story’s narrator to life, as a radio host charting the rise of the band to fame. Relive the story first-hand as the notorious manager that leads the band to fame and fortune. The branching narratives, twists and tales of the story will lead you down a path for you and your band to either rock, or ruin, and only by making the hardest choices can you help this band reach their true potential. Manage their practice sessions, sculpt their image, and do everything a good manager will do and maybe you’ll find a diamond in the rough with this misfit bunch of anthropomorphic animals. Or, simply use their hopes and dreams to line your own pockets, at the end of the day – the choices really are yours. Ladies and Gentlemen: Rock \u0026 Roll. Wishlist Rockbeasts now on the Xbox Store today.",
