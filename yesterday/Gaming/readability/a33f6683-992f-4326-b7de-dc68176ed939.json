The land line, that is.  At the start of the month we were finally without a hardwired phone connection to the public switched telephone network.  We were no longer connected to a worldwide network of cables by a pair of copper wires hooked up to a box stuck to the side of the house.  It was the end of an era really, there having been such a phone in every place I had lived since I was born. We’re back to this phone And I was honestly glad to see it go. I had been advocating for it for the last few years, largely due to it having become a semi-useless form of communication.  Every time our landline rang a telemarketer got their wings… or something.   It was almost always some robocall trying to sell us something or scam us on something, uninterested in who was actually answering the phone.  They would have happily talked to the dog, if we had a dog. (The cats couldn’t be bothered.) And that was when the phone worked.  There is a problem at the junction box up the street that causes it to fill with water when it rains.  With a light rain, the line is all static, while a heavy rain shuts down service altogether.  Fine, it doesn’t rain that much here, but it still rains.  So the phone goes silent in bad weather.  Good. My wife, however, was having a problem unhooking from the lifelong copper connection to the rest of the world.  Like me, she saw the phone as an important tool all of her life and, while she has had a mobile phone since the days of the now chunky looking Motorola flip phones, she still had trouble parting with the solid, dependable (in he mind at least) land line. It wasn’t until our parents generation started getting rid of their land lines that she would budge on the idea, and I still had to ask for that to be my Christmas present this year.  Rather than buying me something she could just turn off the land line and save us the $100+ a month it was costing us.  Not only was it not reliable, it was more than 3x the price of my cell phone plan… a plan that has unlimited long distance in the US.  The land line still cost us extra if she called somebody more than three zones away, like it was 1972.  It used to infuriate me that she would call a friend in the east bay on the land line, a per minute charge, when calling on her cell phone was no additional cost. So at the end of November she called up AT\u0026T… after all these years and corporate changes, it is still Ma Bell, in name if not in composition, handing the phone in our house… and had them turn off the line.  They didn’t even argue their case the way Comcast does if you try to cancel cable. (We literally only have cable TV still because they made it cheaper to get internet and cable together than to get internet alone.)  A couple of days later we were told the line would be dead. This, as expected, changed nothing in our day to day life.  I don’t even know if the line is really dead.  I didn’t bother to check.  I had long ago disconnected the extension in my office and never answered the phone if it rang.  Even the insulated copper wire is still hanging slackly across our back yard, bridging the gap between the telephone pole and the corner of the house, a now useless appendage like the few remaining TV antennas still jutting up from the occasional roof in the area. That is the often the way of things.  There was no big event when this bit of technology was turned off for us because we had long since moved on.  We were just turning the switch off in a room that was already empty. But in a more metaphorical sense, and we love metaphor around these parts, it was the end of an era and no child born in this century will likely ever experience any of the goofy things I covered in the early posts in this series.  In part because the tech has moved on… who needs the time lady when your smart phone tells you the time… and in part because the internet and smart phones mean you’re unlikely to be bored enough to go walk through the mall to note down the phone numbers of all the pay phones so you can call them later to see who answers or use the numbers to scam the phone company into letting you make a free long distance call. Also, there are no more pay phones. I certainly don’t want to go back to that era either. But it is still interesting to me that, in my lifetime, we went from what was often a set of mechanical switching systems… those switches replaced the live human operator physically patching you into a line… to digital switching (we use the word “switch” because it was, at one time, a physical switch and we keep using the same word to describe analogs) to touch tone dialing to… well, to a point in time where I have an iPhone that has more computing power, more working memory, and more storage than all the computers I owned in the 80s, 90s, and at least up until the year 2000… combined.  And that phone, which I rarely use as a phone, has a higher video resolution than any of those early computers. Basically, my iPhone 11, which is totally out of date because we’re up to iPhone 16 now, puts Captain Kirk’s communicator and Commander Spock’s tricorder to shame.  Also, do kids these days even know who those two are? It is now hard to imagine the world without the now ubiquitous smart phone.  We all have a phone, video phone, answering machine, weather station, camera, video recorder, music player, information kiosk, entertainment machine, video game console, and more in our hand or pocket or purse all the time.  It is no wonder we’re all distracted all the time. The whole thing has changed how we live, and in some odd ways.  I mean sure, it is amusing to watch a movie or TV show from before, say, the mid-90s and point out how simply having a smart phone would change the plot.  But there are a lot of silly little things that have changed. I remember somebody wanted to take photographs in the store back when I worked at Safeway.  That was expressly forbidden by company policy.  Can you imagine some store trying to police that sort of policy when we all have a camera on us?  Can you imagine any venue trying to seriously crack down on photographs.  You need the power of arrest and people with guns to enforce that. And, of course, it has forever put to bed the argument about whose watch is correct… first, because who wears a watch anymore… or if you do wear one it is likely paired to your phone which gets the time for the phone network which has to keep everybody in sync to work correctly. It is a different world. And I still don’t answer the phone… mostly because I leave it in silent mode and forget to check it until a few minutes after thinking “what is that buzzing sound?” I think that is the end of this series… though, knowing me, I’ll come up with something later to append to it.
