  "description": "10 Fortnite hidden gnomes are scattered across the Remix Chapter 2 island--just like the old days. Remember when Fortnite used to hide gnomes all over the island? Well, in Fortnite Remix Chapter 2, the game is at it again. It makes perfect sense, too, as the game has returned to the Chapter 2 island--with a remix, of course. In this guide we'll show you where to find all 10 Fortnite gnome locations.Unlike most modern Fortnite quests, these gnome locations won't be shown on the quest screen, even if you track the quest. It's like an extra layer of nostalgia for a time when Fortnite demanded you look outside the game to solve some of its mysteries.You can use our pictures below to spot the gnomes precisely where they are--don't worry, they never move so you'll always find them in these spots until you interact with them to collect each gnome.If you prefer a map showing all the locations from a bird's eye view, scroll to the bottom. Before you head off, though, here are a few tips:Make sure you interact with each gnome to check it off your list. Just spotting it or even hitting it with a car or your pickaxe isn't enough.Secondly, you can grab gnomes in any order. Though our map numbers it the 10th and final gnome, you may be best off trying to grab the gnome atop the southeast snowy mountain--The Weather Station, as the landmark is known--because there's a helicopter there and you can use it to quickly travel between locations.Lastly, you don't need to get every gnome in one round. In fact, you will likely not due to the storm damage (not to mention other players). 1. Craggy Cliffs - Behind the cash register of a store on the west side 2.
