Right now you can pick up a Cyberpowerpc Gamer Supreme Gaming PC equipped with a Radeon RX 9070 XT GPU for $1,784.99 shipped after a $165 instant discount. This is already a competitive price point for a gaming PC equipped with the Radeon RX 9070 XT GPU and would be an excellent option for comfortable gaming at up to 4K resolution. However, what really sets this prebuilt apart from others is that it's housed in a Phanteks Evolv X2s chassis, which was one of the cooler cases to come out of CES 2025.Cyberpowerpc Gamer Supreme RX 9070 XT PC for $1785CyberPowerPC Gamer Supreme AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D Radeon RX 9070 XT Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)The Cyberpowerpc Gamer Supreme is equipped with an AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU, Radeon RX 9070 XT GPU, 32GB of DDR5-6000MHz RAM, and a 2TB PCIe 4 M.2 SSD. The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D has an established reputation of being one of the best gaming CPUs available. And despite the fact that it was released back in 2023 and has been replaced by the newer Ryzen 9 98000X3D, it is still a highly recommended gaming CPU that won't bottleneck your graphics card.The Radeon RX 9070 XT Received a 10/10 at IGNWe rated the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT a \"perfect\" 10/10. Even though it costs $150 less than the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, the 9070 XT beats it out in several of the games we tested. In a few benchmarks, the results aren't even close. The 9070 XT is also comparable in performance to the older $1,000 RX 7900 XTX but with better ray tracing and upscaling performance than its predecessor. It does lose out on VRAM (16GB vs 24GB), but that isn't really an issue for gaming.The Phanteks X2 Was a Showstopper at CES 2025The Phanteks Evolv X2 was one of the coolest looking cases to come out of CES 2025 and this is the first time I've seen it incorporated in a readily available prebuilt gaming PC. The actual case used is the X2s which is a sligtly modified model reserved for system builders. It's a hefty midtower chassis with a panoramic tempered glass design that makes it look like the motherboard is suspended in the air. It's definitely not for cramped spaces but this case looks amazing and offers good cooling potential and future upgradeability.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
