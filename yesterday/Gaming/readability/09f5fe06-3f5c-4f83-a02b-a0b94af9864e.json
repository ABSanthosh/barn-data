Plus, new Squid Game Bundles bring the Pink Guards, VIPs, and Young-hee into the fight. The competition begins as Squid Game drops into Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone in celebration of the release of Squid Game Season 2 on Netflix! Try your luck in the deadly games with Squid Game-themed LTMs across all three modes going live alongside the in-game Event featuring rewards, like the new “Front Man” Operator and the new Cleaver Melee Weapon. Plus, get into the competitive spirit with three Squid Game-themed Bundles arriving throughout the Event. Enjoy a thrilling start to the New Year as the Squid Game Event goes live starting January 3 at 10AM PT through January 24 at 10AM PT. Earn XP, Get Rewards in the Squid Game Event Zip up your green tracksuit and earn XP in Multiplayer, Zombies, or Call of Duty: Warzone to earn rewards in our new Squid Game Event Pass and prove your standing as a top contestant. The Squid Game Event Pass is free for all players, and the Premium Track will be available for 1100 COD Points.  All players can earn Squid Game-themed rewards along the Free reward track of the Event Pass, including the instant reward “Player 006” Operator Skin, plus the “Player 115” Operator Skin and Loading Screen, Emblem, Sticker, Calling Card, the new Cleaver Melee Weapon, and more. Free Track Mastery Reward: Cleaver Unlock the new Cleaver Melee Weapon to make short work of the competition. Chop and slice with a mix of attacks, including a devastating heavy attack. Get More with the Premium Reward Track While every player can progress and unlock items along the Free reward track, a second Premium reward track in the Event Pass offers even more. Purchase the Premium track to access the ability to unlock additional themed rewards, including the instant reward “High Authority” XM4 Assault Rifle Blueprint plus Blueprints for the Knife, GS45 Pistol, and Saug SMG as well as a Concussion Grenade Equipment Skin, a Finishing Move, the “Throwdown” Emote, the “Who’s Left” Talking Gun Screen, and more! Complete the premium track to turn the tide on the other competitors: Ultimate Mastery Reward: “Front Man” Operator Become the leader of the Pink Guards with the “Front Man” Operator. Deploy as the ruthless administrator of the Squid Game and take your team to victory. Let the Games Begin! Compete in multiple Squid Game-themed Limited Time Modes across Multiplayer, Zombies, and Call of Duty: Warzone. Pay close attention to the rules; your life depends on it! Red Light, Green Light [MP] Young-hee is watching, so don’t misstep at the wrong time. Get on the pitch in the Red Card stadium and play three rounds of Red Light, Green Light, each two minutes long. In Round 1, no one gets a weapon. In Round 2 and 3, you can pick up weapons on the ground and eliminate other competitors with melee attacks and Finishing Moves. There’s just one simple rule: When Young-hee says “Green Light,” the fight is on. Move a muscle after she says “Red Light” and you’re toast. Pentathlon [MP] Prove that you have what it takes in the long run by competing in a series of Multiplayer modes to find out who reigns supreme! Play Domination, Kill Confirmed, and Hardpoint along with two new mode variants: Piggy Bank Team Deathmatch and Roulette. In Piggy Bank TDM, every elimination adds score to the Mega Piggy Bank; fight for possession of the huge payout when it drops part way through the match. In Roulette, one-shot eliminations via the Roulette Handgun award double the points, though with each fired shot there’s a chance it’ll blow up in your hands! Matches can end in a draw, so fight for every advantage to see that you win. Squid Game Moshpit [MP] Fire up the Squid Game Moshpit including Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Hardpoint with a twist as Operators gain access to three important Squid Game-themed features: Red Light, Green Light Scorestreak: Is the fight getting too hectic for you? Stop the enemy in their tracks with this Scorestreak that calls “Red Light,” commanding all enemy Operators to stop moving or risk elimination. Piggy Bank: Eliminated Operators have a chance of dropping a Piggy Bank that awards a small score boost when picked up. For a bigger pay day, watch for the Mega Piggy Bank. Every elimination adds additional score to the Mega Piggy Bank, so once it drops, fight for it to acquire all the deposited score within. Roulette Handgun: The epitome of high risk, high reward. The Roulette Handgun spawns in the center of the map; grab it to activate a permanent UAV effect while wielding it and land one-shot eliminations against enemies, earning more than double the normal score to help you obtain Scorestreaks more quickly. The catch?  Your location will be marked for everyone to see, and every shot has a chance to blow up the weapon, taking you down with it. Dead Light, Green Light [ZM, Liberty Falls, Citadelle des Morts] Deploy to Liberty Falls and the new Citadelle des Morts Zombies map to compete in an undead version of the stop-and-go game in Dead Light, Green Light. In the “Green Light” phase, Operators gain a bonus to earned Essence, so rack up the zombie eliminations. Once “Red Light” is called, Essence is drained from any Operator who moves, so spend big before this phase or hang tight to avoid throwing away your hard-earned currency. And it doesn’t end there. When the dreaded “Dead Light” phase begins, prepare for a tough fight as a meaner wave of enemies approach. Squid Game — Call of Duty: Warzone [Urzikstan] Squad up and compete in a rotating series of challenges on Urzikstan that will see only the most hardened competitors emerge victorious. At the end of each round, underperforming squads will be eliminated. Keep your eyes peeled: at any time, a new challenge may trigger a round of Red Light, Green Light. You know what to do. New Squid Game Store Bundles Why compete when you can control, spectate, and determine who wins and who loses in the race? Look for new Squid Game-themed Bundles arriving in the Store throughout the Event. Squid Game 2: Pink Guards Tracer Pack Keep the games under control with one of three new Operators included in this Bundle: Deploy with the “Masked Manager,” the “Masked Soldier,” or the “Masked Worker.” For close eliminations, take out enemies with the “Winner” Finishing Move. Enforce the rules with two Weapon Blueprints: the “Game Guard” SMG and the “Rule Master” Assault Rifle. Plus, get the “Enforcer” Emblem, “Bank” Reticle, “Where it Stops” Weapon Charm, “Bank” Reticle, and “Play Time” Calling Card. Squid Game 2: The VIPs Tracer Pack Sit back and soak in the spectacle with two VIP-themed Operators, the “Panther Mask VIP” and the “Lion Mask VIP.” Not the humble type concerning their immense wealth, the Bundle also features a variety of rich items, including the “Choicest” Launcher, “Lacquered” Sniper Rifle, and “Satin Slayer” SMG Weapon Blueprints, plus the “Death Plated” Frag Grenade Equipment Skin. For a classier finish, end them with the “Pinky Up” Finishing Move, and never let them forget your elite status by equipping the “Gilded” Emblem, “List Required” Calling Card, and “Very Important Player” Loading Screen. Squid Game 2: Young-hee Tracer Pack Punish the enemy’s every move with the “Young-hee” Operator, accompanied by the “Don’t Move” Assault Rifle and “The Curator” Marksman Rifle Weapon Blueprints, and the “Hit Pause” Finishing Move for close-ranged eliminations. Young-hee watches their every move; keep them in line by also equipping the “She Watches” Emblem, “Lethal Look” Large Decal, “Stay Still” Spray, “Under Her Gaze” Calling Card, and the “Uncorked” Emote.
