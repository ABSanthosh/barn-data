  "text": "I do love a good scare, to be fair Image credit: Capcom Right, how about a look at Resident Evil: Requiem then 'ey? Capcom revealed their latest entry in the horror series earlier this month at Summer Game Fest (after a little bit of a prank), but didn't really show off any gameplay. It was more just a \"hey, it's real, and also here's our protagonist Grace Ashcroft!\" kind of reveal. Our own Edwin got to take a look at it in action around the same time, but a new trailer during today's Capcom Spotlight has offered up a bit of a look for the rest of us now too. This trailer was more of a quick look at some thoughts from some of the devs intercut with bits of gameplay. For one, the core concept of the game is apparently \"addictive fear.\" It's all about that satisfying feeling that you get when you overcome your fears. The devs spoke a bit about Grace too, who's apparently a bit more of an introverted character, and gets scared easily. Capcom actually thought about going with Leon again, but felt they needed someone as a protagonist who would be just as scared as someone playing the game. Capcom Spotlight | 6.26.2025 Watch on YouTube While there wasn't a huge amount of gameplay shown off, there were some bits both in first and third person. Apparently the idea behind having both is that first-person is meant for people that want to get immersed in the horror of it all, whereas third-person is more about seeing all of the action. If you're interested in hearing more about the game, longer versions of these interviews will be available on the Resident Evil portal. Resident Evil: Requiem isn't that far away either, as it's currently slated for release this coming February 27th, 2026. That's less than a year away, for those keeping count, but I'm sure you can hang on that long, right?",
