  "text": "Urban Jungle is a relaxing game about putting plants into spaces in your home, creating your own lush green world in your living space. Plants have their own likes and dislikes when it comes to where they are placed. This is something that you can slowly learn over time for each of the individual plants. In Urban Jungle, you find yourself trying to place plants into rooms to make them as happy as possible, along with bringing joy to your living place. You start out as a young girl visiting her grandmother’s house. Her grandmother absolutely loves plants and wants some help placing them all. In each level, you get to pick two plants from each bundle of plants, some of which are free and some of which cost coins. You can then place the plants you have selected into the house. Once you’ve selected your two plants, you can the place them out into the room. When selecting the plants, though, you can see if they need light, humidity, and what plants they love and hate being near. Your goal is to make these plants happy. As such, these levels have designated areas that are humid or lit, but you can also move around objects in the room, unpacking boxes and turning on lights to change the environment. Some of the levels have special challenges like petting a cat or clearing off specific areas as well. Urban Jungle is split into levels that tell a story of your character growing up and moving from place to place. There is a diary to show you all of the plants that you have ever had, keeping a record of what you’ve liked and placed. You can spend time just creating spaces as well. To advance into the next level, you need to get a set number of points from happy plants, which can be challenging, but at the same time you can play for absolute ages in some levels, putting out an almost unlimited numbers of plants. Urban Jungle will be made available today on Steam.
