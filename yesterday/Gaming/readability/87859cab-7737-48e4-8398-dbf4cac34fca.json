In that \"oh, I never would have guessed this game would get one\" kind of way. Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, as its full name goes, doesn't have an exact release date just yet, but during today's Triple-I showcase it did get a release window, which is the next best thing I suppose. It's a vague-ish window though, sometime this summer. Read more",

In that \"oh, I never would have guessed this game would get one\" kind of way. Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, as its full name goes, doesn't have an exact release date just yet, but during today's Triple-I showcase it did get a release window, which is the next best thing I suppose. It's a vague-ish window though, sometime this summer. That's not too far away at least, given that by my understanding of the way the Northern Hemisphere works summer is the next season. Might be a bit awkward if developer Digital Sun were based in the Southern Hemisphere, but last I checked Spain was in the Northern one, so we should be good. Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault - Release Window Trailer | The Triple-i Initiative Watch on YouTube The new trailer showed off a pretty nice look at the game too, which is looking quite lovely. Obviously the first game was all pixel art, whereas this one's taking the 3D approach - seems to be a bit of a trend these days - and I think it's been translated very well so far. As before you'll be exploring dungeons, fighting baddies, and most importantly grabbing loot to bring back to your shop to hopefully sell on and make a fat wad of cash. You'll apparently be able to invest in the local village so that you can eventually get better weapons and things like that. Everything looks neat if you ask me! Again, no exact release date, but whenever Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault arrives this summer, it'll do so as an early access release.",
