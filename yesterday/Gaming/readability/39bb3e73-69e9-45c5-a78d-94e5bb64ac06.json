Disney invited me aboard its latest ship to share with the world why this is one adventure that simply shouldn't be missed, and I'm excited to do so.This Disney Treasure Ultimate Guide will provide everything you need to know about the ship, from the best food options to which shows can't be missed to which lounges and bars deserve your time, and I'd be more than happy to answer any further questions you may have below!Before we get started, I do want to share that I discovered the meaning of the name Disney Treasure is not so much gold or gems, but the love we have for each other. I know this may sound sappy, but it's easy to take for granted these once-in-a-lifetime moments we get to share with our loved ones that are worth more than any amount of riches one can ever hope to earn, and this ship really took that to heart.From the outstanding Tale of Moana with a cast and crew that has many members from the islands that inspired this story to the Plaza de Coco that reminded us our family will be with us forever and so much more, the theme of family, our love for each other, honoring those that mean the most to us, and being proud of where we came from was a part of every corner of the ship and it really made it feel like magic. So, without further ado, let me share with you why the Disney Treasure is so special, and be sure to let me know your thoughts below!FoodPlaza de Coco Was an Emotional Dining Experience I Won't Soon ForgetWorld of Marvel Is a Fun Adventure Through the MCU1923 Is a Celebration of Disney's PastMarceline Market Is The Gold Standard for a Buffet at SeaMickey \u0026 Friends Festival of Foods Gives You More Choice on Where to DineEnchanté by Chef Arnaud Lallement Is One of the Finest Dining Experiences at SeaPalo Steakhouse Is an Adult-Exclusive Meal Worth the Extra CostJumbeaux’s Sweets Is a Love Letter to ZootopiaEntertainmentThe Tale of Moana Is One of the Greatest Shows I've Seen for One Very Special ReasonBeauty and the Beast and Disney Seas the Adventure Are Fantastic Broadway-Style ProductionsAquaMouse Is a Water Slide Starring Everyone's Favorite MicePools and Water Play For All AgesHero Zone Is an Incredible Excuse to Have FunSarabi Is a Lion King-Themed Theater With So Many Great OptionsWonderland and Never Land Cinema Brings the Newest Movies to the Disney TreasureLounges and CafesThe Haunted Mansion Parlor Is the Perfect Extension of the Disney Parks AttractionSkipper Society Brings the Jungle Cruise to This Disney CruiseScat Cat Lounge Is a Piano Bar with an Aristocat FlairPeriscope Pub Is a Wonderful Excuse to Go 20,000 Leagues Under the SeaThe Rose Is a Beautiful Place to Share a Drink and a ViewJade Cricket and Heihei Cafes Are Delightful Walkup CafesOceaneer Club and the 'it's a small world' nursery Are the Definition of Disney MagicStaterooms and The EPCOT-Themed Tomorrow Tower Suite Disney Treasure MerchandiseFoodPlaza de Coco Was an Emotional Dining Experience I Won't Soon ForgetOf all the dining options aboard the Disney Treasure, Plaza de Coco won my heart as it was one of the most delicious and emotional dining experiences I’ve had in quite some time. As the name suggests, Plaza de Coco is based on Pixar’s Coco and transports guests to Santa Cecilia three years after the events of the film. This all begins with the first few steps as you get to see recreations of the Rivera family’s shoe workshop, pictures of the family, the letters Héctor wrote Coco when she was little and the song lyrics and notes of all the songs we love from the film, and so much more. However, the tears really start flowing when you arrive at Rivera’s Ofrenda, as it is complete with the restored photo of Héctor, Mama Imelda, and Coco and the photo of an older Coco now that she has passed.This feeling of celebrating those we love reverberates throughout the whole experience, and that’s even before we get to the main event. The Plaza de Coco experience takes place over two nights, with the first reintroducing us to Miguel and the Rivera family and the second night turning the plaza into a Dia de los Muertos celebration that stars our favorite characters and songs from the film.Plaza de Coco on the Disney TreasureThe show was very good, and they even included an emotional moment where we all got to honor the loved ones we have lost, but I do want to warn that your experience may vary depending on where you are seated. We were in a far corner and it was hard to keep track of everything going on and we didn’t have the best views of what was happening in the middle. Not a deal breaker by any means, but something to be aware of!And the food! Plaza de Coco had my favorite bite of the entire cruise in the Michoacán Carnitas Tacos. The pork was so tender and crispy in the perfect places and it came with delicious tortillas, pillowy-soft cilantro-lime rice, and a perfectly spicy Salsa Roja Asada. It really was remarkable.Other highlights included Miguel’s Churros Calientes, which were everything you’d hope a churro would be from its crispy outside and soft inside, the Beef Birria Empanada, which is the perfect appetizer, and the Red Chicken Enchiladas, which hit all the right notes for me. There also is a different menu on the first and second night, so you get the chance to try a ton of authentic Mexican food that has been crafted with a lot of love!World of Marvel Is a Fun Adventure Through the MCUWorld of Marvel is the other big themed dining experience on the Disney Treasure, and it’s a fun journey into the MCU. We were seated for the Marvel Celebration of Heroes: Groot Remix show and it was a fun experience that featured some of your favorite songs from the Guardians of the Galaxy films. It was fun to see Groot plan a surprise party for Rocket, but the real star of the show for us was the trivia you could participate in on the table. They have these Quantum devices on the table and they ask Marvel questions in-between the big Groot moments, and they were the perfect distraction as we waited for our food. My son, who is 5, was so excited when he got the answer right and couldn’t get enough! Image Credit: DisneyI will say, while the Groot show was entertaining and the payoff was sweet, it wasn’t the most memorable night. I think what it was missing was a big moment where a Marvel character came out to greet all the guests, like in the other show - Avengers: Quantum Encounter. In that show, Spider-Man comes out and runs around to say hi to everyone and it’s a really special thing.As for the food, it was good meal with the highlight being the Malaysian Chicken Satay appetizer. The chicken was so tender and juicy and it paired perfectly with the roasted peanut dipping sauce and spicy cucumber salad. I was also able to try the Beef Wellington and it was tasty, but could have used a bit more sauce and texture. Everything was just a bit mushy. For dessert, I had the Orchard Peach Tart with vanilla sauce and dulce de leche ice cream and it was a nice end to a fun meal!1923 Is an Celebration of Disney's Past1923 is the main dining room experience aboard the Disney Treasure and, while it doesn’t have any show component, it celebrates the over 100-year history of The Walt Disney Company with storyboards, sketches, props, and more. Image Credit: DisneyI got the California Riesling Risotto and it was surprisingly good. What I love most about cruises is trying food you may have never had before, and this combination of Sweet Green Pea, Fava Bean, Malabar Spinach, and Toasted Pine Nuts was the perfect example of that. It’s also home to the Chocolate Lava Cake, which is always a delight.Marceline Market Is The Gold Standard for a Buffet at SeaMarceline Market, which is named after Walt Disney’s early childhood home, is the cruise buffet restaurant and it is really wonderful. It’s kind of a tradition for guests to make Marceline Market one of the first stops when you get on the cruise as your room usually isn’t quite ready, and that meal is so special because it is delicious and it means your cruise has officially arrived. And what’s a better feeling than that?We had one lunch and one breakfast at Marceline Market on our three-day trip and some of the highlights included the Chicken Tikka Masala, chicken fingers, mac and cheese, POG (Passion Fruit, Orange, and Guava) Juice, the charcuterie board, Mickey Waffles, and Eggs Benedict. There are so many options at Marceline Market that I couldn’t even try the raw bar with crab and shrimp cocktail, all the single desserts, plentiful soup and salad options, and much more. On the Disney Wish, where I was able to to eat at Marceline Market multiple times, I will say it did get a bit old as they didn’t change up the dishes all that much. That being said, it’s a great option for those who want a quick and delicious meal!Mickey \u0026 Friends Festival of Foods Gives You More Choice on Where to DineIf you leave Marceline Market and head across the pool deck, you will enter Mickey \u0026 Friends Festival of Foods. This festival contains Mickey’s Smokestack BBQ, Donald’s Cantina, Daisy’s Pizza Pies, Goofy’s Grill, and Minnie’s Delights, and they are another great option for switching up your dining experiences.Mickey’s Smokestack BBQ was the best of the bunch for me as the ribs and brisket were so tender, fall apart, and delicious. There are a bunch of other options and a few BBQ sauces to try, and I found myself wanting to come back for more A LOT.Donald’s Cantina won second place for me as it is the Disney Treasure’s take on a Chipotle-style meal. You can get a burrito, bowl, or tacos, and there is an extensive salsa and hot sauce bar that gives you a lot of customization options to make the perfect dish. Goofy’s Grill is where you’ll go if your craving a cheeseburger, hot dog, chicken fingers, or some french fries. They are classic and delicious and, like many of these other options, I just wish they were open a bit later. The only stall that is open late is Diasy’s Pizza Pies, and they sadly don’t make the greatest pizzas of all time. It is good as far as pizza goes, but it was probably my least favorite stall.Lastly, we have to talk about Minnie’s Delights, because this shop is the home of the legendary cruise ship soft serve. You can get chocolate, vanilla, swirl, and more and it hits the spot every single time. 10/10. Enchanté by Chef Arnaud Lallement Is One of the Finest Dining Experiences at SeaFor those looking for a truly high end dining experience, you all need to look no further than Enchanté by three Michelin-starred Chef Arnaud Lallement. Lallement is also responsible for the menus of Disney Dream and Disney Fantasy’s Remy, and he returns for this Beauty and the Beast-themed multi-course meal that is adult-exclusive and features French-inspired cuisine. I wasn’t able to try Enchanté this time, but I’ve heard nothing but great things!Palo Steakhouse Is an Adult-Exclusive Meal Worth the Extra CostThose who have sailed on the Disney Magic, Wonder, Dream, or Fantasy may be familiar with Palo, the Italian-inspired adult-exclusive restaurant that costs an extra $50/person. However, the Disney Treasure and Wish have Palo Steakhouse, an “evolution” of the original inspired by Cogsworth from Beauty and the Beast. My wife and I were very grateful to Disney for treating us to brunch at Palo Steakhouse, and it just so happened to be one of my favorite meals in years. Beyond offering stunning floor-to-ceiling views of the ocean, this multi-course meal was so fresh, delicious, and inventive that it has me dreaming of my return trip in the future. $50 gets you everything on the menu minus a selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages and that includes as many portions as you can reasonably handle. While we’ll get to the food in a second, I also have to applaud the wait staff for their INCREDIBLE service, friendliness, and enthusiasm for guiding us through the menu. We honestly let them steer the ship for this brunch and I’m so happy we did.We began with both Antipasti Selections - one seafood-focused and one meat-and-cheese-focused - and they were both fantastic. Some of the highlights included the Jonah Crab Claw, Lemon-Marinated Shrimp, Sliced Bresaola, and the Caciotta a Tartuffo. The Bresaola was an air-dried, salted beef that had so much wonderful flavor, and it paired perfectly with the Caciotta a Tartuffo and its divine cheesy and truffle flavor.Palo Steakhouse on the Disney TreasureWe also have to talk about the bread service, because I don’t think I’ve ever had such pillowy soft bread in my life. There was a combination of breads, breadsticks, and more, but the winner was the olive and sun-dried tomato bread that had so many flavors packed into one bite.We then ordered the non-alcoholic Cipriani Bellini, and let me tell you that I instantly went online to see how I can order these at home. They were SO tasty and had a non-artificial-tasting Peach flavor with a carbonated bite that caused me to drink it way too fast. The egg course was next and we tried the Rosemary Ham and Hollandaise Benedict and the Spinach, Asparagus, and Mornay Sauce Benedict and they were very good, even if I wish they had a bit more texture and weren’t as soft. Before our main course we tried the Heirloom Tomato and Basil Soup and it tasted as if the tomatoes were picked right off the vine. There was no filler here, it was delicious tomato flavor that had me looking around for the garden.Finally we reached the Entree course and we split the famous Parmesan-Crusted Chicken Breast with Creamy Risotto, Veal Saltimbocca, and Lasagna Bolognese. Everyone hyped up the Parmesan Chicken before our brunch, and I’m so happy to report it lived up to it. Chicken Parmesan and Risotto are two of my favorite things in the world and they are somehow even greater when paired together.The Veal had a very strong wine flavor from the Barolo Wine Jus which I wasn’t the biggest fan of, but I did appreciate how inventive it was with the Black Garlic Rapini. What surprised me the most, however, was the Lasagna. It may look simple, but it was hiding so many layers of flavor and cheese and was the dish we finished the fastest.To end, we split the Warm Amaretto Chocolate Fondant with Espresso Gelato and the Limoncello Almost Torte. Much like everything else on the menu, these were wonderful and the mix of chocolate and tart worked wonders. I understand I didn’t have to pay for this particular meal, but I do strongly believe Palo Steakhouse is more than worth the price for the views, impeccable service, as much fantastic food as you’d like, and an excuse to treat yourselves on a beautiful cruise ship day or or night.Jumbeaux’s Sweets Is a Love Letter to ZootopiaJumbeaux’s Sweets is a Zootopia fan’s dream come true and is the place to get a sweet treat when aboard the Disney Treasure. While they don’t yet have the Pawsicle (It’s on its way!), they do have Pawsicle-shaped treats, a ton of gelato and ice cream, and specialty goodies like the Judy Hopps Carrot Cupcake, Nick Wilde Raspberry ‘n Cream Cupcake, and more.The theming is also top notch and features a life-size statue of both Nick and Judy, the adorable Lemmings eating their Pawsicles and hopping up and down their private elevator, and more. Jumbeaux's Sweets on the Disney TreasureWhat really sets Jumbeaux’s Sweets apart, however, is how much the team really cares about honoring Zootopia. Pastry Chef Greg McClure shared with me how he was most proud of how they developed the unique Sahara Squares - a whole new cupcake/cake hybrid named after a location in Zootopia that brings the world of the film to the Treasure.EntertainmentThe Tale of Moana Is One of the Greatest Shows I've Seen for One Very Special ReasonI’m not exaggerating when I say my time aboard the Disney Treasure was one of the greatest three days of my life, so I hope you can understand how impressive it is when I say The Tale of Moana was THE highlight of the entire trip for me.This show was not only one of the greatest stage shows I’ve ever seen on land or sea, but it’s truly special because of the story behind it. Much like the film that inspired it, The Tale of Moana is an incredible celebration of the people and culture of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands. And this isn’t just lip-service either as Disney went and recruited much of its cast and crew from those islands, and it was one of the best decisions they’ve ever made.I was speaking to one of my Disney reps and they shared with me a story about how she was speaking to Jodi Kimura, the Hawaiian actress behind the production’s Gramma Tala, and she asked why she chose to leave Broadway to come perform on a Disney Cruise. The reason was beautiful - it was the first time she was going to be able to perform with her people.And yes, that means she was able to share the stage with Moana herself, Kaenaonālaniowaianuhea Kekoa. Kekoa is another Hawaiian actress and I don’t know how to praise her any better than saying she is Moana. She had such a command of the stage with power, emotion, and joy and it sailed straight into our hearts.I had the chance to speak with Kekoa after watching The Tale of Moana, and here’s what she had to say about when she really felt she was Moana, as I think iy strengthens my points better than I could ever hope to;“It was probably the moment when I'm on the boat with Gramma Tala, right before the song ‘I am Moana’ and she's sings, ‘I'm a girl who loves my island, and a girl who loves the sea,’” Kekoa said. “That really got to me as I am a girl from an island and I love the sea and my people and being able to share that with the world... that's probably the moment I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I am this girl… but we are all this girl!“We all have ancestors whose legacy we have the honor of carrying on and passing down. So I hope that everybody can see that and a piece of Moana in themselves.”The Tale of Moana on the Disney TreasureI strongly encourage you to check out my full write-up on The Tale of Moana so you can hear from more of the creatives, but I think it’s amazing that I’ve gone this far and haven’t even mentioned how remarkable the show itself was. From people dancing and acting as the ocean and carrying Moana across the stage to the massive and unbelievable Te Ka puppet that transformed back into Te Fiti on stage to Gramma Tala as a manta ray soaring across the theater, there were so many moments that all led up to one of the most impressive standing ovations I’ve ever been a part of. I don’t have enough good things to say about The Tale of Moana, and my only regret is that only those on the Disney Treasure will be able to see it. Here’s hoping one day it is able to sail beyond the reef and make its way to Broadway or elsewhere because the world needs to see this truly fantastic adaptation of Moana.Beauty and the Beast and Disney Seas the Adventure Are Fantastic Broadway-Style ProductionsThe other two shows on the Disney Treasure - Beauty and the Beast and Seas the Adventure, were also very, very good, but I want to start with Beauty and the Beast. We all love the story and music from that classic Disney film, but what made this show special is the cast of The Tale of Moana also performed Beauty and the Beast. Why is this special? I’ll let Jenny Weinbloom, VP of Disney Live Entertainment, tell you.\"The Tale of Moana is so powerful, but what I also love about what we do at Disney Cruise Line is that our shows are all performed in rep, which is to say this same cast is performing our other big shows on the ship like Beauty and the Beast,” Weinbloom said. “The first time I saw this cast, who I'd fallen in love in The Tale of Moana, perform Beauty and the Beast, I was struck and I found myself weeping in the middle of that opening number because Belle's little provincial French village looked like Motonui.Image Credit: Disney“I just thought, what a beautiful little sense of connection that both of these little villages now have, no matter what the people look like, no matter where our performers may be from, these little villages have so much more in common than we might think. It really is beautiful.”As for Disney Seas the Adventure, it’s a much shorter show that is the perfect kick-off for a cruise. This show sees Goofy steering a ship and getting swept away to the worlds of our favorite films like The Princess and the Frog, Moana, Frozen II, and more. There are also some numbers where they combine beloved characters and songs together in a mash-up, and those were some of my favorites. AquaMouse Is a Water Slide Ride Starring Everyone's Favorite MiceAquaMouse is the big water slide ride on Disney Cruise Ships and the Disney Treasure features an all-new Mickey and Minnie Mouse short called Curse of the Golden Egg. This is a very fun water slide that isn’t too scary, and will definitely be a highlight for the younger guests.Image Credit: DisneyPools and Water Play For All AgesSpeaking of water activities, there are plenty of ways to cool off on a hot day aboard the Disney Treasure. You can hop into one of the 10 pools and play areas inspired by Mickey Mouse and his friends, the younger guests can enjoy the delightful Toy Story Splash Zone, and the whole family can hop on the Slide-a-Saurus Rex slide for a thrilling few moments of fun. And yes, there are adults-only pools for those times you want some peace and quiet.Hero Zone Is an Incredible Excuse to Have FunThe Hero Zone is an Incredibles-themed room that transforms and offers a ton of fun experiences for guests of all ages. One of the best times to visit is when the Incred-Games are happening, which encourages families to come and compete in challenges in an inflatable obstacle course. Some of the obstacles include busting through a “brick wall,” getting through Jack-Jack’s Whack-A Rac, testing your flexibility in Elastigirl’s Stretch-O-Rama, and much more.Hero Zone is also home to the ADORABLE Jack-Jack’s Incredible Diaper Dash, Tink’s Neverland Challenge, and Free-Play Sports.Sarabi Is a Lion King-Themed Theater With So Many Great OptionsSarabi is just one of the many lounges aboard the Disney Treasure, and it is home to musical performances, comedy acts, family game shows, trivia, dance parties, and so much more. While there are other venues that offer similar activities, the Lion King-themed Sarabi is the main theater for these events that can fill out your cruise day. The best show I saw during our cruise was the brand-new ‘Choose Wisely! An Indiana Jones Comedy Adventure.’ This show not only went through the events of all the Indiana Jones films and tastefully made fun of them, but the INCREDIBLE and HILARIOUS hosts - Sage and Coriander - led guests through a choose your own adventure. Image Credit: DisneyThere would be a choice one of the characters would need to make, and the hosts would be “whipped” back to reality to ask guests in the audience to “choose wisely” and make the right choice. Of course, a lot of the fun happened when we didn’t choose wisely! Strongly recommend this show!Wonderland and Never Land Cinema Brings the Newest Movies to the Disney TreasureConsidering Disney has created some of the most beloved films of all time, it only makes sense that Disney Cruises would have a way to watch some of them in the middle of the ocean. However, what makes these theaters special is they oftentimes include the newest movies that are still in theaters. During our trip, Moana 2 was showing multiple times and you could bring your loved ones or yourself, grab some popcorn and treats, and enjoy a film at sea!Lounges and CafesThe Haunted Mansion Parlor Is the Perfect Extension of the Disney Parks AttractionOne of the things that makes the Disney Treasure so special is it is the first time Disney has brought Disney Parks experiences aboard a Disney Cruise Ship. We’ll get to the Jungle Cruise-inspired Skipper Society shortly, but I can’t wait to talk about The Haunted Mansion Parlor.This is, simply put, the perfect extension of The Haunted Mansion itself and may just be one of the best lounges/bars I’ve ever been to in my life. Listen, I know I’m making some grand statements here, but these spaces are just that good.The Haunted Mansion just screams (pun intended) authenticity, from the iconic ticking clock sound to a floating Madame Leota to eerily familiar paintings that hide dark secrets to hitchhiking ghosts and the always wonderful 'Grim Grinning Ghosts,' there is so much love and care put into every inch of this lounge. It also has its own story with a nautical twist, and that makes everything happening around you a little more meaningful.The centerpiece of The Haunted Mansion feeds into this story and it is the ghost fish aquarium. This is a feat of Disney Imagineering marvel and its history is just as impressive as the aquarium itself.The piece is an homage to Imagineer Rolly Crump and his Museum of the Weird that was set to be a walkthrough experience next to The Haunted Mansion. While it never saw the light of day, this aquarium now lives on in The Haunted Mansion Parlor. This wasn’t an easy thing to build either, as it came down to the wire to get the effects working properly, especially considering you can approach the aquarium from all sides.The tributes to Crump didn’t end there, however, as there is also a bust of the Imagineer in the parlor that is a nod to the Haunted Mansion and his Museum of the Weird.The Haunted Mansion Parlor on the Disney Treasure\"Another character we all loved from the Museum of the Weird was Rolly Crump's Candleman,\" Joseph said. \"Sadly, Rolly passed away during the development of the Haunted Mansion Parlor and we were all saddened by that and the fact he'd never get to see it completed. \"So, we knew we wanted to do a bust in there no matter what just like you'd find in the Haunted Mansion, but we then knew the perfect choice was to make it of Rolly. To make it even more special, one of our team members suggested we do Rolly partially as the Candleman and make sure the side of his head that's melting is next to the fireplace. This was a huge honor and another really detailed thought and the authenticity of the design that follows suit with everything else in the Mansion parlor.\"It’s all these little details that make this lounge so special, and that obviously extends into the drinks. I don’t really drink alcohol, but I loved that references the drinks made, from The Chilling Challenge to Regions Beyond to the Happy Haunts IPA and Pallor Mortis Pale Ale to the Spirit-Free Bottled Soda ‘Potions.’ There’s also an awesome secret menu that guests can discover for themselves. I won’t spoil it here for you, but I will say that sometimes the answer requires a different perspective. Skipper Society Brings the Jungle Cruise to This Disney CruiseAs I previously mentioned, Skipper Society is a lounge inspired by the Jungle Cruise and it’s one of the Disney Parks attractions that now has a home on the sea. Much like The Haunted Mansion Parlor, there is so much love and care put into this lounge that would make even the most die-hard Jungle Cruise fans proud.One detail that I love is they used exact replicas of the greenery from the actual Disneyland attraction to adorn the ceiling, making it feel even more as if you are in queue getting ready to hop on a Jungle Cruise boat. Image Credit: DisneyAnother special addition is the nameplate of the EMS Express Boat in the bar. Many may not realize it, but this is a nod to the Ems river in Germany where the Disney Treasure first sailed to the sea after its construction was finished.I could go on and on about the radios that feature Skipper talking with their very specific brand of humor, the ‘Missing’ poster for the infamous playwright cat, the stage with a beautiful wooden-carved wall of animals, the art piece that is a map of the Disney Treasure attractions if they were on the river, and so much more, but a lot of the fun is discovering these surprises for yourself.I will mention the delicious drinks and food on offer at Skipper Society, and some of the notable ones are the Apple Cinnamon or original waffles, the Hippopotomai-Tai, Safari So Good, and Jungle Juice. Scat Cat Lounge Is a Piano Bar with an Aristocat FlairThe Scat Cat Lounge is a piano bar themed after 1970’s The Aristocats and it is just so great. It’s very classy lounge that has the feel of an old-school jazz club with the little touches that add the Disney Magic.I particularly like that paint-covered paw prints left by Toulouse on the piano, the ‘Ev’rybody wants to be a cat’ light fixture on the wall, and the poster that features cats from the team that helped bring the Scat Cat Lounge to life. What also makes this lounge special is that it is right next to the Agrabah-inspired Grand Hall and it takes the Aladdin and Aristocats theming to heart and blends them together wonderfully so the transition isn’t so jarring for guests.Periscope Pub Is a Wonderful Excuse to Go 20,000 Leagues Under the SeaPeriscope Pub is such a cool area that honors 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and the now-closed attraction inspired by the film at Disney World, and it’s meant to make you feel as though you were underwater in a submarine. You can see fish, sharks, and even giant squid swim above you as you are enjoying a drink or grabbing a bite, and can enjoy sporting events and more in this mostly adult-exclusive space.There’s also a fun Easter Egg to lookout for in Periscope Pub as you can see the number 718 on a pressure gauge. This number is in reference to what Meyer’s Werft shipyard calls the Disney Treasure - 718. The Rose Is a Beautiful Place to Share a Drink and a ViewRight outside of Palo Steakhouse and Enchanté sits The Rose, which may be one of the most gorgeous lounges I’ve ever been in. This Beauty and the Beast lounge, much like Palo, has incredible views of the ocean and it’s all adorned in gold and features artwork inspired by that famous rose from the film. However, the true star of The Rose is the hallway, which has you walk past portraits of characters from Beauty and the Beast until you get to the rose itself under glass. It’s simple, but so, so beautiful.Jade Cricket and Heihei Cafes Are Delightful Walkup CafesEven the walkup cafes have a touch of wonder, and the Disney Treasure has the Moana-themed Heihei Cafe and the Mulan-themed Jade Cricket Cafe. While they aren’t overly themed, there are some incredible little touches, including a jade sculpture of Cri-Kee in a cup of tea and a statue of Heihei. Oceaneer Club and ‘it’s a small world’ nursery Are the Definition of Disney MagicOn the Disney Treasure, there may be no place that has quite as much magic as the Oceaneer Club and ‘it’s a small world’ nursery. These kids clubs are absolutely incredible and there is so much love and care put into them. My son couldn’t get enough of the Oceaneer Club, which is for kids ages 3 to 10, and I learned why when I got a tour of the space.The Oceaneer Club is gated and you need to check your child in, so it’s a great place to drop them off if you want to experience one of the adult-exclusive meals or otherwise, and once you enter you have the choice to go right of left. To the left is both Marvel Super Hero Academy and Star Wars: Cargo Bay, and these are both places to meet characters, build your own Marvel Super Hero Suit, interact with creatures from a galaxy far, far away like a porg and Loth-cat, and much more.When you go right, you can enter Fairytale Hall and visit rooms inspired by Tangled, Beauty and the Beast, and Frozen. And yes, the characters will show up here and interact with the kids. When I was there, Rapunzel and Flynn showed me around Rapunzel’s room and discussed all her drawings and more. It was wonderful.Oceaneer and 'it's a small world' nursery on the Disney TreasureThe Walt Disney Imagineering Lab is next and this was one of my favorites as I love the Imagineers and how they are instrumental in creating real-life Disney Magic. In this room, kids can learn what it takes to build and design experiences and attractions for Disney Parks and Cruise Ships, experience a virtual roller coaster, and even see cool tricks like this butterfly below.The last space in the Oceaneer Club is Mickey and MInnie Captain’s Deck and it’s a wonderful indoor playground themed to Disney Cruise Line. As you can see, there is something for everyone, and we didn’t even mention the dance parties or themed games and activities that happen all throughout the cruise. I was so amazed by the details and care put into this space, and that was all before I wandered into the nursery.The ‘it’s a small world’ nursery literally brought me to tears, especially considering I have a one-year-old. This whole room is themed after the beloved Disney Parks attraction, but this time it features characters from all your favorite Disney, Pixar, and Marvel characters. Oh, and Disney lullabies are being played at all times which caused my waterworks to go into high gear. It’s such a beautiful and lovely space and, combined with the outstanding staff, is a place I feel so comfortable leaving my most important little ones. Staterooms and The EPCOT-Themed Tomorrow Tower Suite The Disney Treasure has very comfortable staterooms in 4 main categories - Inside, Oceanview, Verandah, and Concierge. We stayed in a Deluxe Family Oceanview Stateroom with Verandah and it had a beautiful balcony that let you sit and enjoy the ocean breeze whenever you desired. The rooms were also pretty spacious and featured a variety of different themes based on Disney movies. We had a Luca room, and there was a beautiful mural above the bed and other nice touches all around.Disney Cruise Lines also have a multi-bathroom set-up, where there is one room with a toilet and sink and another with a sink and shower/bath. This is all designed to let guests get ready in stages and get people going as quickly as possible.While we didn’t get to stay in one, we were able to tour the Concierge-level Tomorrow Tower Suite, and it was a stunning tribute to EPCOT.The EPCOT-Themed Tomorrow Tower Suite on the Disney TreasureThis two-story suite is placed inside the ship’s forward funnel and has its own private elevator and a two-story window that can be dimmed for extra privacy. The nearly 2,000-sqft suite can comfortably accommodate up to eight guests and features two main bedrooms, a library/bedroom that is fully accessible, and children’s room with a ceiling filled with stars and constellations. There are also 4.5 bathrooms to go with them.The living room is perhaps the most impressive part of the Tomorrow Tower Suite as it features a breathtaking iridescent chandelier that is a kaleidoscope of colors and, when the sun is at the right position, it causes a dance of rainbows to light up the room. In addition to all of this, there is a fully stocked fridge with Mickey Bars and other goodies, the ability to order Palo Steakhouse to the suite, and so many nods to EPCOT including the iconic geodesic sphere, Figment, The Lands, and so much more.

However, the true star of The Rose is the hallway, which has you walk past portraits of characters from Beauty and the Beast until you get to the rose itself under glass.

These kids clubs are absolutely incredible and there is so much love and care put into them. My son couldn’t get enough of the Oceaneer Club, which is for kids ages 3 to 10, and I learned why when I got a tour of the space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eThe Oceaneer Club is gated and you need to check your child in, so it’s a great place to drop them off if you want to experience one of the adult-exclusive meals or otherwise, and once you enter you have the choice to go right of left. To the left is both Marvel Super Hero Academy and Star Wars: Cargo Bay, and these are both places to meet characters, build your own Marvel Super Hero Suit, interact with creatures from a galaxy far, far away like a porg and Loth-cat, and much more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eWhen you go right, you can enter Fairytale Hall and visit rooms inspired by Tangled, Beauty and the Beast, and Frozen.

As you can see, there is something for everyone, and we didn’t even mention the dance parties or themed games and activities that happen all throughout the cruise. I was so amazed by the details and care put into this space, and that was all before I wandered into the nursery.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eThe ‘it’s a small world’ nursery literally brought me to tears, especially considering I have a one-year-old. This whole room is themed after the beloved Disney Parks attraction, but this time it features characters from all your favorite Disney, Pixar, and Marvel characters. Oh, and Disney lullabies are being played at all times which caused my waterworks to go into high gear. It’s such a beautiful and lovely space and, combined with the outstanding staff, is a place I feel so comfortable leaving my most important little ones. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-cy=\"title2\" id=\"epcot\"\u003eStaterooms and The EPCOT-Themed Tomorrow Tower Suite \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eThe Disney Treasure has very comfortable staterooms in 4 main categories - Inside, Oceanview, Verandah, and Concierge. We stayed in a Deluxe Family Oceanview Stateroom with Verandah and it had a beautiful balcony that let you sit and enjoy the ocean breeze whenever you desired. The rooms were also pretty spacious and featured a variety of different themes based on Disney movies.
