It's normally listed at $1,499.99, but a 20% instant discount drops it to $1,201.12 with free shipping. Lenovo Legion laptops are highly rated for their build quality, powerful unthrottled components, and solid warranty. This laptop is sold and shipped by Amazon directly, not a marketplace vendor.Lenovo Legion 16\" RTX 4070 Laptop for $1202.69Lenovo Legion 5i Intel Core i7-14650HX RTX 4070 Gaming Laptop (32GB/512GB)The Lenovo Legion 5i gaming laptop features a 16\" 2560x1600 QHD+ IPS display, Intel Core i7-14650HX processor, GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 512GB SSD. The Intel Core i7-14650HX is a 14th gen CPU with a max turbo frequency of 5.2GHz with 16 cores, 24 threads, and a 30MB cache. This is a great multi-purpose chip and, in fact, better at gaming than the newer Intel Core Ultra 7.The RTX 4070 mobile GPU with 140W TGP (including Dynamic Boost) is powerful enough to run games comfortably on the native 2560x1600 or QHD+ display. It can also hold its own compared to the newer Blackwell cards. Notebookcheck, among other sites, have benched the newer RTX 5070 Ti mobile GPU and it only improves in performance by about 10%-15% despite the fact that it costs more than double the price of this laptop.We have entered that transition period where deals on RTX 40 series laptops are not as prevalent as they used to be, and RTX 50 series laptops are so new that the prices have yet to fall to a reasonable level. Throw in the tense situation revolving around tariffs and you can see why \"good\" laptop deals are harder to source now compared to even just late last year. This deal was pretty good even before, but it's a great deal right now.More gaming laptops we recommendNeed more options?
