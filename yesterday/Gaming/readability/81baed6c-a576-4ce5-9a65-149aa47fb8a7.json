  "description": "As most people know, Tabs was a demanding employer. He was also very fair to his employees. More than generous, actually. In keeping with his holiday traditions, Rosie allowed us to take the next two weeks off (thank you so much, Rosie!). Consequently, the employees of Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC have been up to their vacation shenanigans, which for me meant blogging while dressed up as a cat lady lumberjack. Makeup, of course, has been on Connorâ€™s agenda, but sheâ€™s still perfecting her techniqueâ€¦ Marnie has been cruisinâ€™ the streets of Novato looking for tiny dogs with short legs to bark at â€” that is, when Connor isnâ€™t demanding that they play dress-up together. Weâ€™ve all been enjoying this joyful break before Thanksgiving. I hope things are going well with you, too. Weâ€™re here and weâ€™re feisty (just tired). ðŸ˜Š Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 839 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
