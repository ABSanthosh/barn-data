The most consistent Blizzard April Fools feature has been the leaked patch notes Anyway, if you are interested in past coverage, here are posts I wrote in previous years about April Fools, with the peak item from each year. April 2009 – Dance Battle System April 2010 – Equipment Potency EquivalencE Number April 2011 – Crabby the Dungeon Helper (Clippy jokes in 2011 still!) April 2012 – Blizzard Kidzz April 2013 – Crabby re-run April 2014 – Blizzard Outcasts April 2015 – B’Motes and T.I.N.D.R. April 2016 – Hearthstone the MMO April 2017- Overlord Announcer customized announce package April 2018 – New Micro Holidays April 2019 – Murloc Translator April 2021- Overwatch Googly Eyes April 2022- Carbot Diablo II skin Pack From that list I think things were pretty much past their peak by 2017 and it gets pretty quiet after that.  I stopped doing posts specifically about Blizz April Fools after that.  They still do the WoW patch notes every year, and have dragged out the googly eyes for Overwatch, but it has ceased to be a big deal. Oh, hey, it is patch notes again this year. Well, I always kind of enjoy the patch notes thing. Meanwhile, in 2023 I used an AI to summarize the history of April Fools at Blizz, and it managed to churn something out that was at least… amusing.  I tried to do that again this year, but the loop of AI garbage being used to feed AI learning has made that kind of output even worse as time has gone along.  So I stand by my 2024 April Fools post, about us being the fools for believing in AI.",
