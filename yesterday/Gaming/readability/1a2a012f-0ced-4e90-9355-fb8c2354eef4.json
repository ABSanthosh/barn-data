  "description": "We're one week from the start of Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 in battle royale, which launches on February 21, and in a very pleasant Valentine's Day surprise, Epic has revealed the entire lineup of battle pass skins. And when we say \"lineup,\" we actually mean it literally this time, as you can see the entire crew assembled for a police lineup above. For a much closer look at each of these skins, scroll down to the gallery below for some individual glamor shots.The highlight, no doubt, is the lone collaboration on the battle pass: Sub-Zero from the fighting game series Mortal Kombat. There are eight distinct characters included in the reveal, so this should be every skin in the battle pass. Keep in mind, however, that all of them will have at least one alternate style. So, for example, we've got Sub-Zero in his classic blue look here, but we can expect at least one of his many other looks as well--there are way too many potential options to choose from, so we won't bother guessing.Beyond Sub-Zero, the pass appears to be made up largely of the colorful member of a heist crew, led by a new version of Midas who stole Domonic Toretto's gold chain--it's not quite the Fast \u0026 Furious-themed season we were hoping for, but it's close enough for now. After that, we've got a pickle man, a girl wearing a traffic cone on her head, a lady with two very long braids wearing a 19th century-inspired shirt who is not from Arcane, and a very dapper wolfman who I suspect may actually be the one getting robbed in the upcoming season.While the battle pass reveal is the biggest announcement thus far about Fortnite's upcoming Chapter 6 Season 2, it's not the only thing we know about what to expect from the new season. For everything else we know, check out our rundown here. And for much better looks at each of the skins, keep scrolling.",
