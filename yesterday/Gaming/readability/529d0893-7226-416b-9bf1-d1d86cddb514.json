Following in the footsteps of the 2023 Starfield Direct and 2024 Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Direct, this year we will again have a double feature, with the Xbox Games Showcase immediately followed by The Outer Worlds 2 Direct. It all begins with our annual Xbox Games Showcase, bringing you a look at upcoming titles from across our first-party studios, in addition to incredible new titles from our third-party partners across the globe. This year, the show will be digital-only – our livestream will bring you everything you’ll need to know about what’s next for Xbox, no matter where in the world you’re watching. Immediately following Showcase, The Outer Worlds 2 Direct will bring you inside the walls of Obsidian Entertainment, revealing new gameplay, details, and developer insights, straight from the people making the sequel to the award-winning, first-person sci-fi RPG. You’ll be able to enjoy our June 8 double feature through a variety of outlets, in over 40 languages, as well as American Sign Language, British Sign Language and English Audio Descriptions. These include (but won’t be limited to): YouTube.com/Xbox Twitch.tv/Xbox Twitch.tv/XboxASL Facebook.com/Xbox Airtime for the Xbox Games Showcase followed by The Outer Worlds 2 Direct in local time zones: PDT: June 8, 10am EDT: June 8, 1pm BST: June 8, 6pm CEST: June 8, 7pm JST: June 9, 2am AEST: June 9, 3am The double-feature broadcast also kicks off a week’s worth of coverage here on Xbox Wire, The Official Xbox Podcast, and the Xbox YouTube channel, featuring updates, exclusive extra details, and deep-dives on many of the games you’ll see in the show.
