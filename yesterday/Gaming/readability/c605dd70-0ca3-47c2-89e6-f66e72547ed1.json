  "text": "As I pretty much said at the end of my last LOTRO post, I had arrived in the Lone Lands.  It was time to dig into my most played and, perhaps, favorite zone. Lord of the Rings Online Of course, you don’t go straight there… not if you’re following the epic quest line, and one of the parameters of this play through is sticking to at least that narrative thread as I go through the game.  I have skipped a bunch of quests along the way… I barely spent any time in The Old Forest and did the minimum in the Barrow Downs for example… Lalia can find her own damn way home… but I went to those places because the epic quest line sends you there. As such, once you talk to Gandalf, he sends you up the Greenway to talk to somebody who then puts you on a horse to head to Candaith’s camp, practically in the shadow of Weathertop, via a back path that I always find interesting as it reveals a connectedness of the game world that isn’t obvious to players who don’t poke into every corner. As a player you would head back to Bree, then go out the south gate and around the Midgewater Marshes to end up at the Forsaken Inn. There it is, beyond the detail line of the draw distance, that famous inn Instead you are brought by what is essentially a hidden path around the back of Bree and its suburbs through the hills and into the Lone Lands behind Weathertop.  It is a route you could follow, if only you knew it was there… and it you are high enough level. It always irks me slightly that there is this wonderful back route for players to discover, but then Turbine decided they didn’t want that, so they salted the whole place with hard mode level 55 mobs to send you packing if you try. Half-Orc ICE will deport you! So you can stay on the mount as it whisks you through this alternate route and admire the scenery and dream of the day when you’ll be powerful enough to go explore it without getting one-shotted. All of which places you at Candaith’s camp. Candaith in repose Candaith doesn’t get up to greet you… but then again, when it comes to the fight at the summit of Weathertop he pleads a lame leg and promises to watch your back while you go in and do all the heavy lifting.  Also, did he come out to this remote spot, which is surrounded by orc camps and other hostile creatures… on a horse pulling a cart full of supplies? Let’s just say that all the rangers of the north are not cut from the same cloth. Anyway, Candaith has a few quests for you, but if you really want to get the full Lone Lands “grab a dozen quests and go on a killing spree” experience, you have to get to the Forsaken Inn.  Candaith will send you there.  I guess he needed the cart full of supplies because he is less a ranger and more a stable master in the vast Free People’s Middle-earth public transit network.  I should probably cut him some slack. When I arrived at the Forsaken Inn I found it… pretty much anything but forsaken.  The place was teeming with visitors and Anlaf was probably rubbing his hands with glee at the number of patrons who had suddenly flocked to his spot on the road on the far side of the marsh. Busy times at the Forsaken Inn Of course, the usual three drfiters were sitting outside the place, but the activity all around them gave their complaints and warnings a different air. Not really selling the place, are you? With people coming and going in droves they sound more like they are worried about gentrification rather than handing out sage advice to random travelers. Ignoring them, I piled on the quests a dozen thick or more and went out to hunt down goblins and boars and wolves and whatever else was on the list.  There is a point, early on in the Lone Lands, when you have all of those in your log, that you can pretty much shoot anything that moves and get a quest update. Tag, you’re it spear thrower! This was also the first time I noticed any performance issues on the server.  It was a weekend and the zone was booming and people were running all over and, on a few occasions, I had the server basically freeze up on me, stop responding to commands, for several seconds.  Nothing bad or extremely long lasting… one time I pulled a mob and then things stopped for a few seconds and then I was back in the fight and able to prevail. Which, honestly, during prime time on a Saturday… isn’t so bad.  The last time I played seriously for a bit I was seeing worse late on a Tuesday night alone in a zone.  The new servers are not magic, but they do appear more capable of handling load… maybe.  There is also still a hella long queue of characters waiting to transfer… the transfer button is off again as I write this… so who know what it will be like when everybody who wants to get over has arrived and they turn on housing and whatever.  But, for the moment Glamdring seemed to be holding up. Was I going to hold up though?  Because I saw that guy again… Pengail… captured by the goblins. He didn’t see us, did he? Duck and move away! My first reaction was to not make eye contact and leave him to his fate. But then I checked my queued up loot… that feature is mostly a blessing… and found I had 17 lost medallions to claim… and you can only claim one… which is a quest starter that sends you back to the Forsaken Inn.  When I made my way back Anlaf told me that it belonged to Pengail and that I should go rescue him. Fine. But then I went back and he wasn’t there.  He was doing his tour of the valley with somebody else.  So I killed Luz for about the fifth time… bro kept just walking into me, I wasn’t even trying… this time for the actual quest and waited for my moment, finishing off some other objectives. I had to check back a few times before I found Pengail tied to his stake.  So I spoke to him and we went off in search of his very important sword, given to him by his father, which had been in his family for a long time. He does go on about that sword I have to admit, in a game where… at this point at least… you toss aside your weapon every few levels for something new, his attachment to this sword seemed a little out of place.  That will change when we get to legendary items, but perhaps not in a good way. Fortunately, with a zone full of people, I barely had to do any work to protect Pengail.  His penchant for running straight at every hostile mob in line of sight was thwarted by a distinct lack of mobs… except for Luz.  We killed him again.  But other than that it was mostly a walking tour of the area that ended with him being rescued. Pengail rescued… also, ash branches Then it was off to other quests.  I ran through a bunch, but left a pile behind… that whole thread in the ruins with the spiders… as I moved through the zone.  My daily bit of blue bar, that stone in my pocket, and the xp boost from the landscape difficulty meant I could move ahead without hitting every single quest. I was going to do a fast tour of the Lone Lands.  There are quests that can keep you running around for ages that I bypassed.  My goal was to get to the far end, get to level 30, maybe… MAYBE… wrap up a few of the deed for the zone, and move on. As such, I was at Ost Guruth and that pile of quests, with all the interesting tasks to deal with… like bloated corpses. If this is your thing… Also in the picture, a barrel of rotten flesh to which I set fire.  Because burn pits aren’t just for modern soldiers.  Fortunately my character won’t suffer from any long term ailments due to exposure to such things. It was also in the Lone Lands that I saw my first few level 150 characters. Wise enough to get to level cap I guess What they were doing in the Lone Lands I am not sure. Anyway, I am now at the far end of the zone, wrapping up some quests, looking to get to level 30 or 31 before I head to Oatbarton to start in on Evendim… maybe my second favorite zone in the first 50 levels.",

get to the Forsaken Inn.  Candaith will send you there.  I guess he needed the cart full of supplies because he is less a ranger and more a stable master in the vast Free People’s Middle-earth public transit network.  I should probably cut him some slack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I arrived at the Forsaken Inn I found it… pretty much anything but forsaken.  The place was teeming with
