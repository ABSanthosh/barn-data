He writes about the latest TV shows and movies, and particularly loves all things horror.I don’t want to speak too soon, but it’s entirely possible we’re on the cusp of a new golden age of holiday themed horror movies. In just the last couple of years, we’ve had the Christmas-set Terrifier 3; Y2K, which focuses on a very specific New Year; and Eli Roth’s surprisingly fun, and unsurprisingly gory, Thanksgiving — and that’s not even mentioning all the Halloween-set horror films, which seem too easy to count. The latest inclusion is (hopefully) Heart Eyes, a new Valentine’s Day slasher, that got a new trailer on Tuesday.Heart Eyes is all about a serial killer who wears a mask with LED hearts for eyes, and murders couples every Valentine’s Day. The trailer is light on story details, but it seems likely that this is a movie where the premise speaks for itself: A couple (Olivia Holt and Mason Gooding) are going to be chased by the titular killer, and a whole lot of people are going to get killed, and that’s probably all we really need to know.Adding to the hope that this movie could be better than just a holiday gimmick is the exciting creative team behind it. Heart Eyes is written and produced by Christopher Landon, the writer and director of the Happy Death Day movies, and directed by Josh Ruben who previously directed Werewolves Within, and is a frequent guest star on Dropout series like Make Some Noise.Heart Eyes is set to arrive in theaters on Feb. 7.",
