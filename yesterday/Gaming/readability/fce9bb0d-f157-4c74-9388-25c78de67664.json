This is the best value for gamers who want a PC that can run any game currently available, but don't want to spend to overspend. The RTX 4070 Super is the best graphics card for most people; it's not exorbitantly priced, and it's powerful enough to run games at up to 4K resolution (although 1440p is its sweet spot).Alienware RTX 4070 SUPER Gaming PC for $1499.99Alienware Aurora R16 Liquid Cooled Intel Core i7-14700F RTX 4070 Super Gaming PC with 16GB RAM, 1TB SSDThis particular model is equipped with an Intel Core i7-14700F CPU, GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER 12GB GPU, 16GB of DDR5-5600MHz RAM, and a 1TB NVMe SSD. The 14th-gen Intel Core i7-14700F Raptor Lake Refresh CPU boasts a max clock of 5.4GHz with 20 cores, 28 threads, and a 33MB cache. If you plan to use this PC as a gaming rig, then an i7 is a much better value than an i9. Performance is nearly identical because games cannot utilize the extra cores that the i9 has. The RTX 4070 Super video card is a significant improvement in performance over the 4070 (about 10-15% faster at 1440p according to our RTX 4070 Super review). In the review, Jacqueline Thomas writes \"The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super is the graphics card we should have got back when Nvidia first released its 4000-series cards. Performance is significantly improved over the original RTX 4070, along with more VRAM that should make the graphics card a little bit more future-proof. If you are in the market for a GPU and you have a budget, this is the best graphics card on the market for you.\"The \"R16\" is Alienware's newest desktop chassisThe R16 is Alienware's current 2024 desktop PC design. It's 40% smaller in volume compared to previous iterations. It features a simple yet proven airflow pattern; air is drawn in through the side intake vents over the GPU area and a 120mm fan at the front of the case, and exhausts by way of a 120mm rear fan and two 120mm top fans. A 240mm radiator for the all-in-one liquid cooling system is mounted to these top fans. Some configurations don't actually include the liquid cooling system, but we rarely include them in this roundup. That's because Alienware's liquid cooling solution is far superior to their stock air cooling and is easily worth the price premium.Why Pick a Dell or Alienware Gaming PC?The Alienware Aurora R16 was one of our picks for best prebuilt gaming PCs of 2024. Not everyone is the DIY type, and these days prebuilt gaming PC aren't that much more expensive than building your own computer.
