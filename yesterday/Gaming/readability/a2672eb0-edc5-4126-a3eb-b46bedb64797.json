It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. If you could eat one food all day long, what would it be? Popcorn! If left to my own devices, I could easily have it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 2. Who in your life is most like you? To be honest, probably my dog, Marnie. 3. Your current favorite store? Ooh, girl. You know you’ve crossed a bridge when you no longer want to hang out at Sephora or Nordstrom anymore. LOL! These days I’m all about Williams Sonoma (the fancy kitchen store)! Who wants to come with me to gawk at gadgets, dutch ovens and tableware? 4. What’s one thing you need to do today? Vacuum, although honestly I don’t know why I keep trying to keep the floors clean.

Vacuum, although honestly I don’t know why I keep trying to keep the floors clean. Between the pets, friends and family coming through, it’s a battle that I can’t seem to win. 5. What helps you have a good day? For me, there are three things. First, I gotta cover my basic needs, like making sure I’m not hungry or thirsty, that I’ve brushed my teeth, gotten out of my jammies, those kinds of things. Second, I need to make a list, otherwise I’ll fritter away my time. The third thing is to remind myself that I can’t control other people by telling myself, “Just let them do what they’re going to do.” It’s been very freeing, doing this. Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S. Here are the questions to copy/paste with your answers in a comment. Talk to ya soon. 1.
