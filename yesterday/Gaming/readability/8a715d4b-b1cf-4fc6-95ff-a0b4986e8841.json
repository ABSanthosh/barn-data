There are endless Harry Potter gifts for every type of fan out there, but if your specific interest is in puzzles, there's some serious variety available to you. Just a quick search for \"Harry Potter puzzles\" will drown you in options from various brands that can take a while to sort through.TL;DR – These Are the Best Harry Potter PuzzlesAs a fan of both Harry Potter and puzzles, I have taken it upon myself to help you find the right Potter puzzle for you. Below I've gathered some of my favorite adult jigsaw puzzles with a Harry Potter theme, as well as some great options for kids. I've also included an awesome model kit that makes for an exciting 3D puzzling experience.Marauder's Map PuzzleMarauder's Map PuzzleThe Marauder's Map is one of the most recognizable items from Harry Potter lore. From Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs, this puzzle looks like the full map from the movie once it's been assembled. The puzzle itself is from The Noble Collection, which is known for making some of the highest quality officially licensed wand and Harry Potter prop replicas. You can see what the fully assembled puzzle looks like below:Hogwart's Express PuzzleHogwart's Express PuzzleThis Hogwarts Express puzzle from Buffalo games depicts Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid as they were at the end of The Sorcerer's Stone. The train is set against a beautiful sunset backdrop, and we also see Malfoy sitting on a bench with Goyle at his side. It's a great-looking jigsaw puzzle from one of the most iconic scenes from the first film of the Harry Potter movie series.Herbology PuzzleHerbology PuzzleThis herbology puzzle is my favorite option on this list. It depicts various ingredients students would find and grow in herbology class. At the center of it all is a mandrake in all its weird root baby glory. The design of this puzzle is reminiscent of the classic drawings you'd find in a vintage botanical identification diagram and makes for a great display piece.Hogwarts Crest Wooden PuzzleHogwarts Crest Wooden PuzzleThis Hogwarts Crest puzzle is made up of 201 laser-cut wooden pieces. It depicts the Hogwarts crest, including all four houses, and a vibrant floral design. What makes this puzzle interesting is that it comes with many unique pieces you'll recognize from the books and movies. These pieces include a witch's hat, the Goblet of Fire, and the Deathly Hallows symbol. It's a great puzzle for both kids and adults to put together.Hogwarts Castle PuzzleHogwarts Castle PuzzleThis 3,000-piece Hogwarts Castle puzzle is an excellent option for anyone looking for something more challenging. The image depicts the majority of Hogwarts Castle and grounds, including Hagrid's hut. There are also owls, a phoenix, a hippogriff, and various other small details that make this larger puzzle really fun to piece together. It's made by Ravensburger, which is our overall favorite puzzle brand on the market right now.Hogwarts Express 3D Puzzle Model KitHogwarts Express 3D Puzzle Model KitWhile not a traditional puzzle, this 3D model kit of the Hogwarts Express belongs on this list because of how cool it is. The kit comes with eight sheets of 181 pieces that you'll need to put togehter. No glue or tools are required to assemble the train, but it may be difficult for young children to piece together. Overall, this is a really different kind of puzzle and excellent alternative to the LEGO Hogwarts express that is extremely pricey.Hogwarts MapHogwarts MapThe second Ravensburger puzzle I'm featuring on this list also depicts Hogwarts castle and grounds, but in map form. The map itself has a rather whimsical design and features a variety of notable locations including Hogsmeade and the Forbidden forest. The puzzle also includes a border featuring small images of various other locations from the story. At 1,500 pieces, it is a bit more challenging that some of the other puzzles on this list, but the end result is worthy of displaying.The Enchanted Car Mini PuzzleThe Enchanted Car Mini PuzzleIf you're looking for a good Harry Potter puzzle for kids, this 100-piece mini puzzle from The New York Puzzle Company is a great option. The image shows Ron and Harry flying in the enchanted car with Hogwarts in the background. This is an iconic point of the story in The Chamber of Secrets, and the design of this image looks like the original cover artwork from the Harry Potter books.Gryffindor Crest PuzzleGryffindor Crest PuzzleEvery true fan knows which house they belong to. Whether you're in Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, or Hufflepuff, there is a crest puzzle available from Aquarius. I've featured the Gryffindor design here, but each house is has its own crest and background color. At just 500 pieces, these smaller puzzles are great if you want to spend an afternoon finishing a single image.Harry Potter Puzzle for KidsHarrty Potter Puzzle for KidsThe final Ravensburger puzzle I have on this list is specifically meant for kids. Not only is it just 100 extra-large pieces, it features bright colors and recognizable characters that make it fairly easy to put together. The box says it is meant for ages 6 and older, so it should be simple enough for younger kids to handle.Jacob Kienlen is a Senior SEO Strategist and Writer for IGN.
