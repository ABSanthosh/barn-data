When was the last time you spent a good amount of time outside? Yesterday morning. Connor had a sleepover with a friend the night before, and the girls wanted to play outside, so we all hung out in the circle. The girls played and did art projects; I walked Marnie and threw her ball for her about a billion times, LOL! 2. Do you sleep on your back, your tummy or your side? Usually my back. If my sinuses are stuffed up (hello allergy season), then it’s my side. 3. What’s something beautiful about today? Well, I get to spend it with the people I love the most – Connor, El Hub, Marnie and Rosie. 4. What’s one pair of shoes you wear a lot?

I have a beat up pair of white Converse platforms that frankly, I need to replace. They’re comfortable and go with everything, though, so I keep wearing them. 5. What’s something you hope to accomplish this week? I really want to support Connor as much as I can this week. She’s finally ready to move up from the junior dance team, and her auditions for the serious competitive team are on Tuesday and Wednesday. So, we’re going to bed early every night, eating lots of healthy foods and hyping each other up for a great week ahead. Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S. Here are the questions to copy/paste with your answers in a comment. Talk to ya soon. 1. When was the last time you spent a good amount of time outside? 2.
