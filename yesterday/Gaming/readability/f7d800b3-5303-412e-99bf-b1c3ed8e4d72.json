In the segment, three core pillars of the game were explored: Combat, which dug into deadly new weapons of mass destruction the Slayer can wield; Exploration, which offered a glimpse at an incredible new medieval-inspired setting that will take players to never-before-seen dark and sinister realms; and Story, which gave an overview of the characters and stakes the Slayer will face in his journey to turn the tides of a war. This is the most ambitious DOOM game to date. id Software is seizing the chance to present both newcomers and long-time fans alike with an epic adventure as the super weapon in a medieval war against hell itself.
