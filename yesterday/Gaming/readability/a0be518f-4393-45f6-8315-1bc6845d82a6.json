  "text": "Image credit: Netflix The fifth and final season of Netflix's live-action The Witcher show is in production, and we've finally had a peek at Liam Hemsworth in the titular role. The Witcher and House of the Dragon site, Redanian Intelligence, which shared the shot, said it's been \"quite a trick\" getting a shot of the actual Hemsworth, as he has had two body doubles popping up on location in the UK, too, often confusing onlookers. There are light spoilers ahead, so click away now if you're prefer to watch the show without advance knowledge. The Witcher 4 World Premiere Trailer from The Game Awards 2024 The Witcher 4 got its first trailer in December.Watch on YouTube As the fourth season hasn't yet aired, it's hard to know where, exactly, in Geralt's chronology we find him, but the sword on his back suggests it's after he was gifted the blade from Zoltan, which has yet to happen on the show. As the location is \"filled with beehives and beekeepers\", some think this could be a scene from Andrzej Sapkowski’s Tower of the Swallow, where Geralt encounters beekeepers who direct him to druids. Druid costumes spotted on set seem to strengthen the theory. The shots also evidence that Hemsworth stuck around to reprise The Witcher role for the final season after assuming it from Henry Cavill, who bowed out of the show at the end of season three. For more shots of Hemsworth - albeit all mainly in the same position and wearing the same costume - head on over to Redanian Intelligence. In related news about the game, we recently learned CD Projekt Red has recast The Witcher 4's Ciri. Whilst originally it only sounded as though the character's original actor, Jo Wyatt, had been replaced in Witcher 4's reveal trailer, the development studio has now confirmed it, albeit without expanding on why Berkeley had been brought in to replace Wyatt. Last week, CD Projekt warned fans of a The Witcher 4 beta test \"scam\", saying it's \"been taking the necessary steps to take this fraudulent messaging down\". The studio shared its warning to the Witcher community in a statement posted to social media, writing, \"Recently, we've been getting reports from some community members that they've been invited to a beta test of The Witcher 4 - this is a scam!\"",
