  "text": "Kitsune Tails delivers some solid platforming challenges, great power-ups through adorable costumes, and a challenging romantic situation. Yuzu is charged with delivering messages for a Goddess, a job that gets her into trouble just moments after starting the game. This puts her in contact with a kind sorceress, though, so maybe the trouble isn’t so bad? And she seems to like you a whole lot. Except you’ve got a childhood friend who also has a thing for you. While being popular with these gals might seem nice, it does cause some trouble that you’ll unravel over the course of a lot of vibrant, varied platforming worlds. When you’re not dealing with your relationship woes, you’ll be running and leaping across an array of different places in all kinds of helpful outfits. The platforming feels solid and precise as you collect coins and smash through blocks. If you bump into any of the wildlife or creatures born from Japanese mythology, you’ll power down into a tiny fox until you can find something to make yourself strong again. Still, it’s far better to get one of the game’s useful power-up outfits instead. Shark costumes that help with swimming, Soldier suits to huck spears that help you climb – putting on some cute new clothes always helps. And you’ll need that help despite the sense that this game is a bit on the easy side from the first few stages. I felt this was going to be a cakewalk, but I soon started really needing those powers as the challenge ramped up. Kitsune Tails is a solid platforming game that feels good to play and has some great personality in its power-ups and stages (I endlessly enjoyed its various haunted houses). I had high hopes for this game after checking out Kitsune Zero, and I’m happy to say that it delivers a great deal if you like your hopping mixed with relationship complexities. Kitsune Tails is available now on itch.io and Steam.
