  "text": "Hello, This year has already been a very busy one for No Man’s Sky, with 6 updates already this year, including the huge Worlds Update. Our last update, The Cursed, dropped just a couple of weeks ago, and players have been loving the spooky Halloween vibe.  In game development some features take weeks or months, and others take years. Today we are releasing some features that have been years in the making. PlayStation 5 Pro PlayStation 5 Pro releases today and is an incredible feat of engineering. We were so excited to get our hands on it from early days of development. We couldn’t wait to see what was possible in No Man’s Sky with so much power at our disposal!  We’re excited to be able to share an enhanced version of No Man’s Sky for PlayStation 5 Pro with players at launch. Bringing even more detail and higher image quality than ever possible on console before. PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) allows for incredible upscaling to provide crisp 4K resolution at 60fps. No Man’s Sky will also be an early supporter of 8k resolution, with the universe looking incredible in 8K at 30fps. As well as a much sharper resolution at higher framerates, the increased power of the PlayStation 5 Pro has enabled us to ramp up the graphical quality across the board. Players on PlayStation 5 Pro will see improved lighting, with ultra quality reflections and higher quality ambient occlusion in all modes. Explore the most beautiful and detailed alien worlds No Man’s Sky has to offer, for the first time on console. Not only this, but all of these improvements also come to PS VR2! With our most stunning virtual reality imagery offering an even more immersive experience for Travellers amongst the stars. Starting from today we are rolling out cross-save support on all platforms. This has been a huge undertaking, and is one of most requested features. No Man’s Sky now supports cross-play and cross-save between a huge number of platforms including last and current generation consoles (including PlayStation 5 Pro – see below), and PS VR \u0026 PS VR 2. Adding the ability to transfer saves between platforms via a server is especially difficult for No Man’s Sky, as the work involved increases with each platform supported and how long folks have already been playing for. Both those numbers are large for our tiny team.  It’s very common for players to rack up thousands of hours of saves exploring across space, building elaborate bases and cataloging their discoveries, with incredibly detailed saves. Adding cross-save for us is a little bit like moving house, the longer people have lived there the more complicated it is to move them! We also have players who played once at launch, eight years ago, suddenly loading up that save on a platform that didn’t even exist back then! The Normandy returns Everyone here at Hello Games is a huge sci-fi nerd. One of our absolute favorite series is the incredible Mass Effect games. To join in Mass Effect’s annual N7 celebrations, we are pleased to welcome the legendary SSV Normandy SR1 back into No Man’s Sky!  It was back in 2021 that the Normandy made its first appearance in one of the first expeditions we ever ran. The limited-time expedition culminated in players being able to claim the Normandy for their fleet. In the intervening years since that event, we have welcomed a huge number of Travellers. Many of these new players have envied those who proudly displayed their Normandy in their frigate collection. Mass Effect fans know that this legendary freighter only appears when it is most needed! Today, and for the next two weeks, as a love-letter from one science fiction game to another, we are giving everyone another chance to encounter the Normandy in an overhauled version of the original mission and add it to their collection. Huge thanks to our friends at Electronic Arts and Bioware for helping make this happen. It has been a momentous year for No Man’s Sky in a number of ways. We’re so grateful to be able to continue this journey with you. Trending Stories",
