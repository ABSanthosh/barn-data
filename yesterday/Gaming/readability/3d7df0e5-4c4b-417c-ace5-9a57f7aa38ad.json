  "text": "Get ready for Magikrab’s Gauntlet, where you’ll hop aboard one of the Mer-line’s interdimensional trains and face off against old friends, foes, and bosses from your previous adventures. This thrilling challenge is unlocked after completing the main story—it’s the perfect test for those who believe they’ve truly mastered their adventures in New Wirral! The gauntlet can be tackled alongside a friend in online co-op – so grab your buddy and brace yourselves; this journey is going to be a wild ride! Enough yapping, let’s explore the specifics of what’s in store when you board the Midnight Train! The gauntlet train is a randomized series of challenging battle encounters, that increase in difficulty as you progress. Think you’ve mastered beast battle? Think again – these are tough battles that are sure to make even the most seasoned adventurer break a sweat! The train also includes: Occasional carriages that contain chests instead of battles. A rest carriage that heals you and saves your progress. You can also spend some of your winnings at Magikrab’s café here! Boss carriages that will test your mettle – including Archangel fights that you are still able to challenge with a buddy! The longer your winning streak, the more Fused Material you’ll rack up. But be warned, the Gauntlet is a double-edged sword — the longer you go, the greater your reward, but you also risk losing it all if you fail a battle along the way. Tap out and claim your reward or push it one more encounter, the choice is yours. You’ll be facing off against many familiar faces as you go (whether as a friend or foe), but all of them have had significant upgrades to their tapes and stickers. Some of the encounters are only present in your gauntlet if you’ve met certain conditions. We’ll let you discover how this affects your run while you play! This update also introduces the Sticker Fusion feature, newly added to the Harbourtown Town Hall. Sticker Fusion allows players with stickers that have rare and uncommon attributes to transfer those attributes onto other stickers, provided that the attributes are compatible. This gives you the chance to revamp your move stickers like never before using Fused Materials. Be sure to stockpile those Fused Materials, they’re a precious commodity! We also have a new cosmetic DLC launching today! The Fashion Pack is priced at $3.99 /€3.99 EU/£3.29 and will come with a ton of new looks for your character as they travel through New Wirral! The Fashion Pack adds the following cosmetic items to the player’s wardrobe: •             Baseball Cap •             Flat Cap •             Twin Tails •             Bow \u0026 Bangs •             Foxy Cut •             Windswept •             Spikes \u0026 Goggles •             Swept Mohawk •             Flower \u0026 Fringe •             Beret •             Round Specs •             Trenchcoat •             Crop Top •             Tall Boots Share your gauntlet progress with us by tagging us @ByttenStudio or, better yet, join our Discord where you can chat with other players, find groups to join, and share your biggest and best moments: https://discord.gg/byttenstudio See you in New Wirral! Raw Fury $19.99 $15.99 PC Game Pass Xbox Game Pass Adventure. Battle. Transform. Welcome to New Wirral, a remote island inhabited by strange creatures you’ve only dreamed of, nightmares you hopefully haven’t, and a cast of brave folks who use cassette tapes to transform for battle. To find a way home you’ll need to explore every inch of the island, and record monsters to your trusty cassette tapes to gain their abilities! Transform into monsters using… retro cassette tapes? Faced with the constant threat of monster attacks, the residents of Harbourtown, New Wirral choose to fight fire with fire. Record a monster to tape, then play it back to take on its form for battle! Fuse monster forms. Getting close to your companion has benefits–while transformed you can combine your strengths to gain the upper hand in battle! Any two monster forms can be fused to produce unique, fully-animated new fusion forms. Explore a rich open world. Certain monster abilities can be used in human form. You’ll need these to help you get around, solve puzzles, and locate dungeons. Glide, fly, swim, climb, dash, go invisible, or turn magnetic! Travel alongside a diverse cast of human companions. Never fight alone! Form bonds, spend time together, and help your selected partner complete personal goals to become a better team. Master a deep battle system. Take advantage of elemental chemistry to apply extra buffs or debuffs alongside your attack, or even alter your opponent’s elemental type! Play with Friends! Team up in online multiplayer to trade Beasts, Challenge your friend to 1v1 duals, or take on a fearsome raid Beast with up to 8 friends to reap great rewards!",
