Stars Reach Campaign One Hour In I went over the preliminary view of the pledge tiers on Sunday and, in glancing down the list now that the campaign is live, the base pledge levels appear to be about what they were communicated over the weekend, while the whale tiers… anything over a thousand dollars in my book, appear to have some additional options. (They have also swapped over the the US English spelling of “traveler” for their tiers.  Maybe they were trying to evoke the old GDW RPG initially.) Now the question is whether or not the Playable Worlds team will reach their goal… though, the goal is low enough that had no problem meeting it.  They were over half way there in the first 15 minutes. The stated purpose of the campaign is to demonstrate player interest in the game so as to help secure the additional investment needed to finish the game, so the next question will likely be if $200K will be enough to establish the level of interest or how much further they will need to go to get investors interested.  I suggested previously that anything less than a million dollars was probably not enough.  We shall see. While fans have been given a glimpse of Stars Reach in the pre-alpha testing, that is only a small corner of what is planned for the game.  We have yet to experience spaceships and exploration of space or anything around an in-game economy.  There isn’t even a currency yet. So there is a lot yet to be done, and a bit of a danger that what has been shown so far might set the minds of players too soon.  I have seen a few comments that, on trying the pre-alpha, somebody has decided the game is not for them. More of a hazard is the general view of video game Kickstarter campaigns, and MMO campaigns especially.  While there have been a few outright scams, most of the bad press has come from once reputable names who asked for money, promised a vision, and subsequently failed to deliver that vision… or anything at all. Broken promises and missed milestones have salted the earth for many when it comes to Kickstarter campaigns.  You do not need to go very far in the comments on any story over at Massively OP to find somebody salty about the whole concept of “I’ll gladly let you play Tuesday for a $100 pledge today.” And then there is the whole property pass things, a subscription that the team is trying not to frame as a subscription, where to have a homestead in game you will need to spend an estimated $10 a month to maintain that via a property pass.  As any economist will tell you, you tax things to make people do them less.  If the game is free but a home costs $10 a month, that is an economic incentive to live a nomadic life… unless a house serves a critical role, in which case having a house will be branded as pay to win.  You watch, that’ll come. At the fireside this past Saturday there was an offer for a lifetime property pass with the $10,000 pledge level.  One of the new tiers added since then is the Forever Traveler, for $450, which also includes a lifetime property pass. The Forever Traveler Tier That is a $200 lift over the base Traveler tier.  Do you think you’ll need more than 20 months worth of property passes?  If so, here is a chance.  As of this moment, 38 people are already pledging for this. Anyway, the campaign is off and running.  The $200K goal has been met.  The upside of such a modest goal is being able to declare victory right away. The downside is convincing people you want more than that I suppose.  There will be people who want the packages, but enough to get to, say, a million dollars?  There is a lot of new info on the campaign page, but no stretch goals yet.  Then again, stretch goals are also a risk. Only 29 days left to go on the campaign.
