Fantasy Critic League â€“ Like Fantasy Football, but for Video Games As was mentioned last week, there were no releases slated for week fifteen.Â  But that doesnâ€™t means stuff didnâ€™t happen. First up though is the review of the scoreboard and where it landed at the end of week fourteen. The Standings for Week 14 With that as the starting point, with no releases, and no score updates broadcast, that should end up being the score for week 15 right? Nah! As I pointed out previously, the Fantasy Critic Discord bot does not broadcast every score update.Â  A theory suggested to me is that only score changes for a title over a certain thresholdâ€¦ maybe half a pointâ€¦ get broadcast. [Theory since verified.] So the fact that no scores were broadcast made the changes to the lineup over the week all the more interesting as it wasnâ€™t clear what was causing it.Â  Basically, this happened: Publisher Score Updates â€“ 4/14/2025 1:04 PM TAGN HQ (Wilhelm) Moved from 6th place to 5th place Pretty Blue Fox Games (Bhagpuss) Moved from 5th place to 6th place Publisher Score Updates â€“ 4/14/2025 5:05 PM Pretty Blue Fox Games (Bhagpuss) Moved from 6th place to 5th place TAGN HQ (Wilhelm) Moved from 5th place to 6th place Publisher Score Updates â€“ 4/16/2025 3:04 AM TAGN HQ (Wilhelm) Moved from 6th place to 5th place Pretty Blue Fox Games (Bhagpuss) Moved from 5th place to 6th place Publisher Score Updates â€“ 4/17/2025 at 9:05 AM Pretty Blue Fox Games (Bhagpuss) Moved from 6th place to 5th place TAGN HQ (Wilhelm) Moved from 5th place to 6th place Publisher Score Updates â€“ 4/17/2025 at 11:05 AM TAGN HQ (Wilhelm) Moved from 6th place to 5th place Pretty Blue Fox Games (Bhagpuss) Moved from 5th place to 6th place I think this was related to the score for Blue Prince fluctuating.Â  It ended up the week with a listed score of 89, down a point. In the end I managed to wrest 5th place from Bhagpuss, though given I have three titles released and he has only two, that is a pretty thin accomplishment. All of which left the scoreboard looking like this at the end of the week. The Standings for Week 15 Potshot remains the projected first place winner while I remain projected for last place. Meanwhile, the FCL Discord bot was chattering away about titles we didnâ€™t pick.Â  I have it set to show notable misses, games that nobody in the league picked but which got scores of 85 or above.Â  This is what it told us about: Lushfoil Photography Sim Now has a score of 85 The Roottrees are Dead Score has gone UP from 83.0 to 84.9 Bionic Bay Now has a score of 92 Bionic Bay Score has gone DOWN from 92.0 to 90 Dawnfolk Now has a score of 90 Dawnfolk Score has gone DOWN from 90.0 to 87.5 Mandragora: Whispers of the Witch Tree Now has a score of 86.7 Lushfoil Photography Sim Score has gone DOWN from 85.0 to 84 So that is a list of titles that have all done better than any of the three titles I have picked so far.Â  And once a title has a score, you can no longer pick it.Â  (I tried) We did have one date change land for the league. Dune: Awakening Picked by Crash and Burn Games (Shawn) Counter Picked by Slightly Scuffed Studios (Kluwes) Release date changed from â€˜Tuesday, May 20, 2025â€™ to â€˜Tuesday, June 10, 2025â€™ On the surface that seems like no big deal.Â  But if you know the history of Funcom you might ponder what would be enough to make them delay shippingâ€¦ well, anything.Â  From Anarchy Online to The Secret World, they have a pretty solid history of just shipping stuff before it is ready.Â  Are they being extra careful because the Dune franchise is a bigger deal?Â  I mean, the Conan franchise wasnâ€™t big enough to daunt them from going to market early. So you can really over think that one.Â  Is it good news for the pick or the counter pick? Anyway, the titles coming up are as follows. Upcoming for Week 16 There are three titles on tap, with two for Bhagpussâ€¦ so unless he has picked very poorly he will no doubt take back that fifth place spot and may even go further. Finally, we did have some bids this week, with two titles getting grabbed. F1 2025 Won by Neutical Publishing (Cyanbane) with a bid of $1 Dying Light: The Beast Won by TAGN HQ (Wilhelm) with a bid of $2 Dropped game â€˜Galaxy Highwaysâ€™ conditionally Cyanbane picked up F1 2025, which I dropped last week while I picked up Dying Light: The Beast while dropping Galaxy Highways.Â  I like to be able to swap around titles the way you can in sports fantasy leagues. There was also a failed bid. Star Wars Zero Company Rusty Shackleford (Shilgrod)â€™s bid of $15 did not succeed Game is no longer eligible: That game is not scheduled to be released in 2025 The release date was moved to 2026 between the pick and the bid resolutions, because it should not let you pick titles that are not eligible.Â  So it goes. And then there was a counter pick. Half-Life 3 (Unannounced) Won by Play Forever Mwahahaha (Shintar) with a bid of $10 (ðŸŽ¯ Counter Pick) Shintar either made an extremely wise pickâ€¦ locking me with Half-Life 3 since you may not drop a title that has been counter pickedâ€¦ or will rue the day when Valve actually releases the long awaited sequel in time for Christmas.Â  There can be no other result. So there it is until next week. Related: TAGN Fantasy Critic League TAGN Discord Server Fantasy Critic Site Fantasy Critic How to Play Fantasy Critic FAQ",

shipping stuff before it is ready.Â  Are they being extra careful because the \u003cem\u003eDune\u003c/em\u003e franchise is a bigger deal?Â  I mean, the \u003cem\u003eConan\u003c/em\u003e franchise
