  "text": "Includes Arkane's acclaimed Deathloop. Image credit: Arkane Studios With the weekend finally in sight (we just need to make it through this year's Summer Geoff Fest first), it's all change on the Epic Games Store. A fresh set of freebies is now available to download and keep, and one of them is Arkane Studios' ultra stylish Deathloop. Epic's latest free games - which replace last week's offerings of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands and Limbo - can be claimed right now, and come in both PC and mobile flavours. You will, of course, need to be in the EU to access Epic's mobile store on iOS, but it's available worldwide via Android devices. But regardless of how you get there, here's what's free right now: Deathloop (PC) Ogu and the Secret Forest (mobile) DEATHLOOP - Official Launch Trailer: Countdown to Freedom Deathloop launch trailer.Watch on YouTube Deathloop, if you're unfamiliar, traps players on the 1960s-styled island of Blackreef, where they'll need to assassinate eight key targets before they can finally escape. The trouble is, the entire place is caught in a time loop, meaning everything needs to be done before the day resets. And worse, another assassin is on your trail. It's part exploratory immersive sim, part chaotic shooter and was good enough to earn itself a Eurogamer Essential back in the day. As for Epic's other freebie this week, Ogu and the Secret Forest is a hand-drawn exploration adventure promising puzzles, mysteries, and more. \"Befriend bouncy characters,\" explains the official blurb, \"and defeat strange creatures to unravel the mystery of the charming world.\" Deathloop and Ogu and the Secret Forest are available to download and keep via the Epic Games Store now and will remain so until next Thursday, 12th June. After that, Two Point Studios' fantastic Theme Hospital spiritual successor Two Point Hospital will take their place.",
