  "text": "Hello, everyone! I'm creating this topic to announce that my game, Azmar Quest (Old School RPG), has been officially released on the Play Store, and is no longer in Open Beta (actually, as of a few months ago) Azmar Quest is both a text-based adventure, with multiple choice dialogues, and a turn-based RPG. It's playable offline (single-player story) or online (PvP, Dungeons, 2v2, and more) Let me know what you think about it! The game is also 100% accessible to blind users through Android talkback support! Google Play Store link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azmar2.sevangames Hi everyone, it's been a while since I last posted, but I've got some news about Azmar Quest! Since May, I've updated the game a lot! Less than I hoped for (I recently got two little kittens, they're adorable but a lot of work), but still significantly. First of all, I redesigned all the images in Chapter 4, Chapter 5, and their respective Extra Missions, along with some bug fixes and text corrections. Then, I finally improved the sounds in the game, so every skill has its specific type of sound. I added the fourth character slot. I expanded the Global Chat with a list of all online players, and you can now invite players to join Team Battles and Dungeons from there. When you picklock a treasure, only that treasure goes into cooldown, not every single one. Another significant change includes two new features: Item Rank Boost to upgrade items and Armor Star Boost to add a star to an armor, increasing its max rank. I’ve also added Chat History in Dungeons and a new feature called Reunite Party. And for new players, most encounters in Azmar Forest, so in Chapter 2 and the Extra Mission, now grant extra experience! If you'd like to give it a try, you can download Azmar Quest on Google Play.
