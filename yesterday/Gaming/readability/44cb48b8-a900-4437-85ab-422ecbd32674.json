  "text": "Michael McWhertor is a journalist with more than 17 years of experience covering video games, technology, movies, TV, and entertainment.The Destiny games, with their laser swords, hover bikes, and space wizards, have always been Kind of Star Wars. But Destiny 2 will go Full Unadulterated Star Wars later this year with a new, Lucasfilm-authorized expansion called Renegades. It literally has lightsabers and Darth Vader in it.Destiny developer Bungie revealed the Renegades expansion, which is slated for a Dec. 2 release, on Tuesday during a livestream for the Year of Prophecy roadmap reveal. The brief teaser for the Renegades DLC is awash in Star Wars sights and sounds, as well as the promise of using Han Solo’s blaster and a green lightsaber in battle. Bungie also revealed a trio of Dark Side skins for the game’s Hunter, Titan, and Warlock classes, based on General Grievous, Darth Vader, and Kylo Ren. They’ll be available as part of the Destiny 2: Year of Prophecy Ultimate Edition, which also includes another expansion — The Edge of Fate — due out in July.Details on Renegades are scant, but it looks like it may include more than just Star Wars-themed cosmetics. The DLC’s teaser trailer shows Guardians scooting across a desert location that looks a hell of a lot like Tatooine. Bungie devs said in a livestream on Tuesday that that desert-like world will be set in the Star Wars universe.Beyond Guardian skins, expect cosmetics for sparrows and other items. If you can’t buy a Marksman-H combat remote decoration for your Ghost later this year, something has gone horribly wrong.Destiny 2 previously flirted with the Star Wars franchise in February, when Guardian cosmetics based on the Stormtrooper, Death Trooper, and Imperial Guard were added to the game alongside the Heresy expansion. Destiny 2: Renegades and The Edge of Fate will be released this year on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.",
