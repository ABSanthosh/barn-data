Fantasy Critic League – Like Fantasy Football, but for Video Games Not every score is great… but nobody is still left sitting at zero.  But first we’ll look at where we left off on the scoreboard at the end of week eleven. The Standings for Week 11 With that we were expecting two titles to launch in week twelve, and that was what we got. Atomfall has released! [Picked by Pretty Blue Fox Games (Bhagpuss)] The First Berserker: Khazan has released! [Picked by Hare Brained Schemes (p0tsh0t)] Atomfall had enough advanced reviews to have a score show up last week, when it rang in at 75.7, which would have been 5.7 points on the scoreboard.  Somewhere along the way it got a score update which did not get announced by the Fantasy Critic League bot on Discord, but the end result was a score of 4.91. That is not the worst score so far in the league where, excluding counter picks, I hold that honor with Sniper Elite: Resistance, which rang in with a 73, so was good for 3 points for my tally.  Apparently being the “unessential” 12th game in the franchise dragged down its score despite the comments about the actual game play being very favorable.  So go the reviews. You can, by the way, click on the game titles on the score board and it will give you a link to the critic summary page, such as this one for Atomfall, so you can see what the vibe is… if that is your thing. The First Berserker: Khazan on the other hand only got a score this week, where it rang in with a fairly solid 79. The First Berserker: Khazan [Picked by Hare Brained Schemes (p0tsh0t)] Now has a score of 79.1 Meanwhile, giving hope to those whose titles were down a bit after the first post-launch round of reviews showed up, there were a two revisions upwards. MLB the Show 25 [Picked by Neutical Publishing (Cyanbane)] Score has gone UP from 78.9 to 80 WWE 2K25 [Picked by Rusty Shackleford (Shilgrod)] Score has gone UP from 78.8 to 80.3 Both titles had gone down a bit with the initial post-launch reviews, only to claw back about one point each this past week. All of which left us with the following standings at the end of the week. The Standings for Week 12 As noted above, the bot doesn’t seem to broadcast all score updates, but it does note changes in position, which this week saw second and third place swap: Publisher Score Updates: Frabjous Day Enterprises (Archey) Moved from 3rd place to 2nd place Slightly Scuffed Studios (Kluwes) Moved from 2nd place to 3rd place So that is the way things are laid out at the end of week twelve. There were also no bids this week, so no new picks are on the board. For week thirteen… we have nothing listed to ship. Coming Up for Week 13 So unless there are some revisions to scores or changes in ship dates, it should be a quiet week. Finally, there was one ship date change: Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 [Picked by Rodent Entertainment (Arhanta)] Estimated release date changed from ‘First Half of 2025’ to ‘October 2025’. That is a fairly large change in target, from first half to the back quarter of the calendar year.  But it is also a somewhat more focused… so maybe that is good?  Also, I am in another league where I have picked that title (my picks between the two leagues are comically different at points… I have counter picked the WoW Midnight expansion here but it is one of my picks there) so I am invested in this a bit. Anyway, maybe something will happen next week. Related: TAGN Fantasy Critic League TAGN Discord Server Fantasy Critic Site Fantasy Critic How to Play Fantasy Critic FAQ",

2025’.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is a fairly large change in target, from first half to the back quarter of the calendar year.  But it is also a somewhat more focused… so maybe that is good?  Also, I am in another league where I have picked that title (my picks between the two leagues are comically different at points… I have counter picked the \u003cem\u003eWoW Midnight\u003c/em\u003e expansion here but it is one of my picks there) so I am invested in this a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, maybe something will happen
