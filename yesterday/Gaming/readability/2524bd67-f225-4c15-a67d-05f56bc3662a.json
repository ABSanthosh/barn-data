Urana enlisted Andou, a graffiti artist, to help inspire the design of the original manga, as well as to provide all the graffiti that appears within its pages.Serialized in Weekly Shōnen Magazine since 2022, Gachiakuta follows Rudo, a member of the underclass in a society that exiles its waste and its criminals to the same place: a massive dump known as the Pit. When Rudo is falsely accused of murder, he winds up down there as well, where, in the manner of a classic shonen protagonist, he takes up with a group of people who battle the trash beasts of the Pit — each using their own “vital instrument” made from mundane objects imbued with meaning — in order to further his goals of revenge on the society that wronged him.",
