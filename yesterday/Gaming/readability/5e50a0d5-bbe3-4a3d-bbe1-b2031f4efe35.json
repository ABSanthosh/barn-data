  "description": "Later this year, Borderlands 4 will send players to explore a new planet called Kairos. A previous trailer introduced the game's villain, the Timekeeper, and his minions. Now, the Borderlands 4 dev team is sharing a closer look at Kairos itself, as well as the various factions who live there.
