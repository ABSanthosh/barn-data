The 16X is the superior of the two and is on sale right now. Dell is currently offering the Alienware Aurora 16X gaming laptop equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU and GeForce RTX 5070 mobile GPU for $1,799.99 after a $300 instant discount. That's the lowest price I've seen so far for the Aurora 16X laptop and RTX 5070 GPU combo (the previous low being $1900 during Alienware's Black Friday in July Sale that recently ended).Alienware Aurora 16X RTX 5070 Gaming Laptop for $1,799.99Alienware Aurora 16X Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX RTX 5070 (115W) Gaming Laptop (32GB/2TB)Gamers should go with the Alienware Aurora 16X modelThe Alienware Aurora 16X is the model that serious gamers should consider over the Aurora 16, especially right now when the Aurora 16 RTX 4070 laptop is the same price. There's little argument here; just look at the list of upgrades below:Better display (2560x1600 240Hz G-Sync vs 2560x1600 120Hz)More powerful CPU (Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX vs Intel Core 9 270H)Higher RTX 5070 TGP rating and thus better performance (115W TGP vs 85W TGP)More premium materials (metal alloy lid and chassis vs lid only)RGB keyboard vs white-only backlightingThunderbolt 4.0 portCompared to other Alienware laptops, the Aurora 16X is designed to look less like a gamer's laptop. It boasts a sleek, understated design with the absence of extraneous visual-only embellishments or unnecessary RGB lighting outside of the keyboard illumination. This is a solidly built machine with a metal (magnesium alloy) chassis and anodized aluminum lid and bottom shell. Under the hood, the Aurora 16X still packs a punch with powerful gaming components and a robust Cryo Chamber cooling system. It's much more affordably than an equivalent Alienware 16 Area-51 laptop, which costs $600 more. The Alienware Aurora 16X also weighs 1.6 pounds less and has a 30% thinner profile.The Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX is a top performing CPUThe Area-51 laptop is also equipped with a very powerful CPU as well. The Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX boasts a max turbo frequency of 5.4GHz with a whopping 24 cores and 40MB total L2 cache. According to Passmark, this is the second most powerful Intel mobile CPU available right now and goes head to head with AMD's Ryzen 9 7945HX3D.The GeForce RTX 5070 is 5%-10% better than the RTX 4070The mobile RTX 5070 GPU performs about 5%-10% better than the RTX 4070 that it replaces. That's not a very big generational improvement, but the RTX 5070 also supports multi-frame generation, which means the margin will widen in games that support DLSS 4.0. If you want a significantly better performing Nvidia GPU, you'll have to pick up an RTX 5070 Ti or RTX 5080 laptop. Currently the Alienware Aurora 16 doesn't have an option to equip these GPUs, so you would have to pony up $900 more for the Area-51.Check out more of the best Alienware dealsCheck out our Best Alienware Deals article with all of Dell's currently ongoing deals on gaming laptops and desktop PCs.
