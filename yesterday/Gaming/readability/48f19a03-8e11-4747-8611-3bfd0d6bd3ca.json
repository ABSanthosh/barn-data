  "description": "Survival games aren't all created equal, and determining the best survival games is no easy feat, as community consensus can vary wildly. But there's no denying that the genre has become one of the most popular in the gaming industry, seeing several high-profile releases every year and garnering millions of players.When it comes to classifying a title as a \"survival\" experience, you're primarily looking for it to have survival elements, such as a health, food, or thirst bar you need to keep replenishing. There's also usually an end goal when it comes to a survival game, but this isn't always a dedicated story or plot. Some of the best survival games just have a set of goals for you to hit to get you started on your journey, with the rest of the experience being an open sandbox for you to make what you want of it. Funny enough, several of our picks for the best zombie games also land here, as the undead are such a popular enemy in survival games.Check out our picks for the 29 best survival games in the list below, which showcase all kinds of different experiences within the genre but are also widely available in 2025. As a note, this list is in no particular order. These games span all platforms, but if you're looking for even more to play, check out our picks for the best PS5 games, best Switch games, best PC games, and best Xbox games. MinecraftDeveloper: MojangRelease Date: November 18, 2011Platforms: PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo Switch, iOS, AndroidMinecraft is the game that shaped the bulk of the survival genre and a large part of the gaming industry as a whole. Released back in 2011 (following earlier alpha and beta versions), Minecraft is the second-best-selling video game of all time behind Tetris, selling over 300 million copies as of late 2023. It popularized the sandbox style of survival games, allowing players to do whatever they wanted and build anything that came to their mind. It's still a global phenomenon in 2024 and there are plenty of Minecraft spin-offs to satisfy your desire for more of the pixelated franchise. See on Amazon RustDeveloper: Facepunch StudiosRelease Date: December 11, 2013Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PCWhile you might have some strong opinions one way or the other regarding Rust, it's difficult to deny its overall impact on the survival game genre. When Rust was released in 2013, there were few other games like it on the market. It starts you out with nothing but a patch of clothing and you have to claw and scrap your way to simply obtain a simple weapon. From there, you can construct a large base, invade other players' bases, and fight for control over an island. It's not considered as hardcore of a survival game in 2024, and its community is notorious for griefing new players, but Rust is still one of the better survival games you can play today. See on Amazon Ark: Survival EvolvedDeveloper: Studio WildcardRelease Date: June 2, 2015Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, PC, AndroidThere are few survival games with a more enticing description than Ark: Survival Evolved.

However, in the background, you'll hear some sharp screeches and eventually see your first dinosaur. Ark allows players to kill, tame, and ride all manner of prehistoric creatures to aid them in their survival. It's a one-of-a-kind experience that comes with full base-building and multiplayer elements. A remade version of the game, Ark: Survival Ascended, was surprise-released in 2023; you can check out our Ark tips for new players to help you get off to a good start. See on Amazon ValheimDeveloper: Iron Gate StudiosRelease Date: February 2, 2021Platforms: Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PCEvery so often, a game comes out of nowhere to completely take the gaming industry by storm. In 2021, Valheim became a Steam darling, launching with little hype around it but quickly shooting to the top of the selling charts. If you've played Valheim, you know why it became an instant success. The game's distinct graphical style mixed with Norse lore that's integrated flawlessly with the gameplay instantly hooks new players. Pair those elements with some fantastic base-building and a map begging to be explored, and you have the recipe for one of the best survival experiences on the market. Valheim is still not a complete game in 2024, however, so there's even more content on the horizon for the title. See on Humble SubnauticaDeveloper: Unknown Worlds EntertainmentRelease Date: December 16, 2014Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, PCNo survival game on the market can match what Subnautica brings to the table.

The only way to survive is by swimming down into the water below, where dozens of unique species of fauna and flora call home. The sheer terror that arises from playing Subnautica is next to none, as several massive underwater creatures are aiming to kill you. Subnautica has few, if any, weak points, as the world is stunning, the exploration is stellar, and the base-building is fantastic.If you've already played Subnautica or want an updated version of the game, check out Subnautica: Below Zero. It's a direct sequel to the original that features a new map, updated mechanics and gear, and all-new ocean creatures to encounter. See on Fanatical DayZDeveloper: Bohemia InteractiveRelease Date: December 16, 2013Platforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCDayZ is another one of the original big survival games to enter the genre, and it's where a lot of veterans got their start. Initially a mod for Arma 2, DayZ is a multiplayer-only survival title where you simply strive to survive. There's no base-building or any additional goals you need to complete. You can either work together with other players on your server to outlast everyone else or you can be a lone wolf, eliminating as many players as possible. DayZ isn't a battle royale title, but it did spawn the creation of H1Z1, which in turn inspired PUBG (and, by extension, Fortnite). See on Amazon Sons of the ForestDeveloper: Endnight GamesRelease Date: February 23, 2023Platforms: PCSons of the Forest is the sequel to the critically acclaimed game The Forest, which was a staple in the survival genre for years.

The most recent update in No Manâ€™s Sky is called Relics, and it adds new fossils on planets that you can dig up as well as rebuild them to see what kind of creature the remains came from. See on Fanatical 7 Days to DieDeveloper: The Fun PimpsRelease Date: December 13, 2013Platforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCZombie games were extremely popular back in the mid-2010s, but 7 Days to Die stands out as arguably the best one. It's a survival-horror FPS that features RPG elements, an open world, and a robust crafting system that will have you hooked in no time.

In Astroneer, you're essentially given those necessities right from the start, as the only survival element you need to worry about is oxygen.

See on Amazon Escape From TarkovDeveloper: Battlestate GamesRelease Date: July 27, 2017Platforms: PCWhile Escape from Tarkov isn't a survival game in the traditional sense, it requires players to survive in an arena of other players and NPC enemies. You have to craft items to stay alive, and a timer hurries you to escape the arena with as much loot as you can carry. The only traditional survival element you have to worry about is your health, but Escape from Tarkov features plenty of other survival aspects that allow it to sneak into the genre and onto this list. The game is a hardcore FPS that demands precision, in-depth knowledge of your surroundings, and a little bit of luck. It also popularized an entirely new genre in gaming, called the \"extraction shooter.\" That's led to, among other things, new and upcoming games, such as a revival of Bungie's Marathon. See on EFT's website Frostpunk Developer: 11 Bit StudiosRelease Date: April 24, 2018Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, PCSurvival games don't always have to revolve around combat, and Frostpunk is one of the better examples of this.

You have to make extremely difficult choices regarding the future of the city while also ensuring it doesn't get reduced to rubble.

There's combat with different factions, deep trading systems, a unique crafting aspect, and decisions you have to make for the good of the colony. See on Fanatical Project ZomboidDeveloper: The Indie StoneRelease Date: November 8, 2013Platforms: PCOne of the earliest zombie survival titles to hit the market was Project Zomboid, which took a different approach to the survival genre.

Your goal is to survive against hordes of zombies by crafting items, taking advantage of RPG elements, building defenses, and hunting/fishing for food. You also have to contend with your character's inner demons and natural survival needs.

State of Decay 2 is a massive improvement over the first game, featuring better survival mechanics, stronger AI, and a much more expansive world to explore. The gameplay loop is very similar to other survival games, forcing you to find resources that you use to craft items for survival. However, the community aspect in State of Decay 2 is where it separates itself from other titles, as you're able to take full advantage of the multiplayer mechanics. See on Steam PalworldDeveloper: Pocket PairRelease Date: January 19, 2024Platforms: Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PCEven though Palworld was only released early in 2024 and it tends to copy some elements from another franchise, it's still one of the better survival games released in recent memory.

See on Humble This War of MineDeveloper: 11 Bit StudiosRelease Date: November 14, 2014Platforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Android, PCFrom the same developers who brought us Frostpunk comes This War of Mine, a military survival simulator that focuses on the effects war has on civilians.

Inside the building, you need to maintain your character's health by feeding them and keeping morale as high as possible. You can scavenge for resources to craft survival items, cook food, and make medicine. You're mainly able to scavenge for resources at nighttime, where you can meet other NPCs who are trying to survive the war just like you. This War of Mine ends when a ceasefire has been called, but the time for that to happen is completely random, giving you no end in sight. See on Fanatical Stranded DeepDeveloper: Beam Team GamesRelease Date: January 23, 2015Platforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PCStranded Deep is a game that takes elements from other survival titles but adds its own spin.

Stranded Deep takes place both on the island and underwater, both of which are not overly safe. Luckily, you can craft a slew of different items to survive, including bases, vehicles, weapons, and more. See on Steam Planet CrafterDeveloper: Miju GamesRelease Date: March 24, 2022Platforms: PCIf you find yourself playing Minecraft or another sandbox survival game and keep looking up to the sky wondering what it'd be like to design your own planet, then Planet Crafter is right up your alley.

See on Steam EnshroudedDeveloper: Keen GamesRelease Date: January 24, 2024Platforms: PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|SEnshrouded is a modern survival game with plenty of content to consume, frequent updates from the developers, and an enjoyable gameplay loop. It's an action-RPG that takes place on an open-world map. You have all the basic tropes of a survival game, including base-building, in-depth crafting, and exploration to score more gear for your character and base. The base-building and crafting especially stand out, as you can make a variety of weapons and gear as well as build quite impressive structures. However, at the heart of Enshrouded is a well-laid-out story that forces you to explore every corner of the map and goes hand-in-hand with the game's survival aspects. See on Steam Once HumanDeveloper: NetEase GamesRelease Date: July 9, 2024Platforms: PC, iOS, AndroidOnce Human is a game that can't be defined by a single genre. It's a third-person survival game with RPG elements that takes place in an open world where you can engage in multiplayer with other random players on your server. At the start of Once Human, you're introduced to the story, which involves post-apocalyptic mutations taking over the world, but this takes a backseat to the exploration and survival aspects.Once Human takes place on a huge map that is split up into different zones, each with a corresponding level requirement. To reach new zones with a higher level, you have to complete missions, clear out enemy locations, and keep building up your base. Your level dictates what weapons you can use, the vehicles you can drive, and the base items you can construct. Throughout all of this, though, you have to ensure your character has enough food, water, and stamina to sustain themselves. See on Steam AtomfallDeveloper: Rebellion GamesRelease Date: March 27, 2025Platforms: PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|SAtomfall is a survival RPG title that sees survival elements take a backseat to the worldbuilding and overall plot that the game immediately throws you into. However, the survival elements in Atomfall aren't to be ignored, as you have a heartbeat you have to constantly monitor. The higher your heartbeat, the less stamina you have and the more vulnerable you are. The game also features minimal healing, so keeping your HP up is paramount. Putting survival aside, Atomfall is a fantastic open-world RPG with an engaging story that has multiple endings, difficult combat, and extremely well-designed quests. See on Fanatical",

You have to craft items to stay alive, and a timer hurries you to escape the arena with as much loot as you can carry. The only traditional survival element you have to worry about is your health, but Escape from Tarkov features plenty of other survival aspects that allow it to sneak into the genre and onto this list. The game is a hardcore FPS that demands precision, in-depth knowledge of your surroundings, and a little bit of luck.

The gameplay loop is very similar to other survival games, forcing you to find resources that you use to craft items for survival. However, the community aspect in State of Decay 2 is where it separates itself from other titles, as you're able to take full advantage of the multiplayer mechanics. PalworldDeveloper: Pocket PairRelease Date: January 19, 2024Platforms: Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PCEven though Palworld was only released early in 2024 and it tends to copy some elements from another franchise, it's still one of the better survival games released in recent memory.

Inside the building, you need to maintain your character's health by feeding them and keeping morale as high as possible. You can scavenge for resources to craft survival items, cook food, and make medicine. You're mainly able to scavenge for resources at nighttime, where you can meet other NPCs who are trying to survive the war just like you. This War of Mine ends when a ceasefire has been called, but the time for that to happen is completely random, giving you no end in sight.Stranded DeepDeveloper: Beam Team GamesRelease Date: January 23, 2015Platforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PCStranded Deep is a game that takes elements from other survival titles but adds its own spin.

It's an action-RPG that takes place on an open-world map. You have all the basic tropes of a survival game, including base-building, in-depth crafting, and exploration to score more gear for your character and base. The base-building and crafting especially stand out, as you can make a variety of weapons and gear as well as build quite impressive structures. However, at the heart of Enshrouded is a well-laid-out story that forces you to explore every corner of the map and goes hand-in-hand with the game's survival aspects.Once HumanDeveloper: NetEase GamesRelease Date: July 9, 2024Platforms: PC, iOS, AndroidOnce Human is a game that can't be defined by a single genre. It's a third-person survival game with RPG elements that takes place in an open world where you can engage in multiplayer with other random players on your server.

To reach new zones with a higher level, you have to complete missions, clear out enemy locations, and keep building up your base. Your level dictates what weapons you can use, the vehicles you can drive, and the base items you can construct. Throughout all of this, though, you have to ensure your character has enough food, water, and stamina to sustain themselves.AtomfallDeveloper: Rebellion GamesRelease Date: March 27, 2025Platforms: PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|SAtomfall is a survival RPG title that sees survival elements take a backseat to the worldbuilding and overall plot that the game immediately throws you into.

The higher your heartbeat, the less stamina you have and the more vulnerable you are. The game also features minimal healing, so keeping your HP up is paramount. Putting survival aside, Atomfall is a fantastic open-world RPG with an engaging story that has multiple endings, difficult combat, and extremely well-designed quests.",

The game supports up to 10 players on every planet as well, so you and some friends can terraform large chunks of the environment to completely transform it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-item-position-url=\"#28\"\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1745/17457013/4468186-en.jpg\" alt=\"Enshrouded\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3\u003eEnshrouded\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeveloper\u003c/strong\u003e: Keen Games\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelease Date\u003c/strong\u003e: January 24, 2024\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlatforms\u003c/strong\u003e: PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eEnshrouded is a modern survival game with plenty of content to consume, frequent updates from the developers, and an enjoyable gameplay loop. It\u0026#39;s an action-RPG that takes place on an open-world map. You have all the basic tropes of a survival game, including base-building, in-depth crafting, and exploration to score more gear for your character and base. The base-building and crafting especially stand out, as you can make a variety of weapons and gear as well as build quite impressive structures. However, at the heart of Enshrouded is a well-laid-out story that forces you to explore every corner of the map and goes hand-in-hand with the game\u0026#39;s survival aspects.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-item-position-url=\"#29\"\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1745/17457013/4468187-oh.jpg\" alt=\"Once Human\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3\u003eOnce Human\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeveloper\u003c/strong\u003e: NetEase Games\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelease Date\u003c/strong\u003e: July 9, 2024\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlatforms\u003c/strong\u003e: PC, iOS, Android\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOnce Human is a game that can\u0026#39;t be defined by a single genre. It\u0026#39;s a third-person survival game with RPG elements that takes place in an open world where you can engage in multiplayer with other random players on your server. At the start of Once Human, you\u0026#39;re introduced to the story, which involves post-apocalyptic mutations taking over the world, but this takes a backseat to the exploration and survival aspects.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOnce Human takes place on a huge map that is split up into different zones, each with a corresponding level requirement. To reach new zones with a higher level, you have to complete missions, clear out enemy locations, and keep building up your base. Your level dictates what weapons you can use, the vehicles you can drive, and the base items you can construct. Throughout all of this, though, you have to ensure your character has enough food, water, and stamina to sustain themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-item-position-url=\"#30\"\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1745/17457013/4468190-af.jpg\" alt=\"Atomfall\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAtomfall\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeveloper\u003c/strong\u003e: Rebellion Games\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelease Date\u003c/strong\u003e: March 27, 2025\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlatforms\u003c/strong\u003e: PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAtomfall is a survival RPG title that sees survival elements take a backseat to the worldbuilding and overall plot that the game immediately throws you into. However, the survival elements in Atomfall aren\u0026#39;t to be ignored, as you have a heartbeat you have to constantly monitor. The higher your heartbeat, the less stamina you have and the more vulnerable you are. The game also features minimal healing, so keeping your HP up is paramount. Putting survival aside, Atomfall is a fantastic open-world RPG with an engaging story that has multiple endings, difficult combat, and extremely well-designed quests.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e    \n          \n    \n  \u003c/article\u003e\n                      \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
