  "text": "To blink or not to blink. That is the question!Did Superman blink... or did James Gunn?In the latest trailer for the filmmaker's upcoming Superman, some eagle-eyed (Kryptonian-eyed?) fans noticed something about... well, Superman's eyes! Specifically, a change that Gunn and his team seem to have made from the first teaser trailer which was released last December.In that first teaser, there's a shot of Superman walking through a crowd of angry Metropolis citizens, seemingly after a battle of some kind where David Corenswet's hero hasn't fared too well. One man in the crowd throws a can of something at the Man of Steel, who flinches a bit and blinks, but continues to walk on without looking back.This had some fans wondering why Superman would react in such a manner to getting hit by a mere can (we don't know what's in the can but let's just pretend it's Duff Beer). But now, in the new trailer, Supes takes the hit like a man -- a super man even! Check out the teaser version and the new trailer version below that:You will believe a man can blink... or not, as the case may be.Of course, it's nothing new for filmmakers to tweak shots from trailers for the final version of the film. Gunn himself has yet to comment on this minor change, and while it's an interesting alteration, it's also a pretty inconsequential one. Sure, we're all combing over every detail of new Superman info as Gunn gets ready to launch his DC Universe on the big screen, but also, I would go so far as to say Superman -- as invulnerable as he is -- is also capable of involuntary physical reactions just like the rest of us. So just as you or I might blink or flinch when, for example, a harmless whiffle ball is thrown at us unexpectedly, it's not out of the realm of possibility that the Man of Steel would also react in a moment like the one in the trailers, despite his relative inability to get hurt.Besides, the real question is why would that guy in the crowd waste a perfectly good Duff Beer like that?In This ArticleNot yet available for streaming.",
