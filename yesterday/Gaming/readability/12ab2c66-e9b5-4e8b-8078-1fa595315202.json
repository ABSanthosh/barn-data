The goal of the event is to collect 12 unique Easter Eggs scattered across the various worlds in the game, with helpful clues provided to guide you along the way. Whether you’ve already discovered a few Eggs or are just getting started, this comprehensive location guide will show you where to find each one.

All 12 Easter Egg Locations in Pet Simulator 99 Look at those cute eggs! Below is a list of all 12 Easter Eggs in Pet Simulator 99, along with the fastest way to find each one. Just follow the steps, and you should be able to track them down without too much trouble. Royalty Egg – Living like Royalty (Easy) In Area 3 of Pet Simulator 99, you’ll come across a Castle on the left side. Once you go inside, look to the right of the entrance, where you’ll see a black egg with a crown hovering above a pile of gold. That’s the Royalty Egg, and you can collect it from there. Ocean Egg – Under the Sea (Easy) You can find this Egg in Area 23 of Pet Simulator 99, which is also known as the Atlantis area. Once you arrive, look for a pedestal directly across from the portal you used to enter. The Ocean Egg will be sitting right on top of it. Tree Egg- Chop Chop (Easy) Head to Area 233, also known as Nebula Forest, and go through the Woodcutting Portal. Once you spawn in the Woodcutting area, look to the left of the portal to spot the Forest Egg. Rocket Egg – One Small Step for Dogs (Easy) Make your way to Area 133, the Spaceship Dock in World 2. There, you’ll see a large grey and orange rocket on the left side. Just to the right of that rocket, you’ll find a red and grey rocket-shaped egg. Magma Egg – Little Toasty (Medium) Go to Area 209, also known as Volcano Island in World 3. Climb the small steps around the volcano, following them like an obby course, to reach the top of the first volcano. From there, jump to the second one, and then make your way to the third mountain. Near the boiling lava, you’ll find the Magma Egg waiting. Paw Egg – To Trigger Something Hidden, Send Something Away (Medium) This one’s pretty easy. Just send a Huge Pet through the Mailbox to a friend or even to one of your own accounts, and you’ll receive the Paw Egg. Lucky Easter Eggs – Odds Increased You can find Lucky Easter Eggs by breaking regular objects throughout the game. Collecting these eggs increases your chances of getting the Huge Marshmallow Kitsune. It’s a good idea to keep an eye out for them as you play. Hunt Easter Eggs – Huge Bunny? During the Easter Egg Hunt event, you’ll come across special Hunt Easter Eggs scattered around the map. Picking these up increases your chances of hatching the Huge Basket Bunny, so it’s worth grabbing as many as you can while the event is active. Secret Easter Eggs – Where is the room? Secret Easter Eggs can be found in the Secret Easter Room, which you can access by using the Easter Secret Key. This key is randomly dropped during the event, and once you unlock the room, the Secret Easter Eggs will help increase your chances of getting the Huge Spring Griffin. And these are all the egg locations that we currently know. Check out our Pet Simulator 99 Super Secret Code article to find a secret. The Escapist is supported by our audience.
