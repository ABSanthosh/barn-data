  "text": "Our rerun through Enshrouded continues.  Last week we launched four new characters into a fresh world, helping out Skippy, his new chosen name, with the intro to the game and settling down at our first base. Welcome to Enshrouded I think Potshot and I both had to sit on our hands a bit in the intervening week, avoiding the temptation to rush ahead and get to some upgrades… like double jump.  I could not stop trying to double jump.  Once you have that skill it is hard to live without. We had setup a little base and had grabbed our first survivor, the Blacksmith, after Skippy had logged off last week, so we got him up to speed on the new location.  That included the introduction to the new crafted items the Blacksmith offers, equipping gear, and the whole cosmetic versus worn gear thing. Potshot had also built out a nice little covered crafting area, handy when it rains, with some storage and some magic boxes.  So that all got settled. Our first base We also went through the skill point thing… again, double jump featured on the tour… and how the game lets you spend and respec pretty easily.  There was a little discussion about who might go for which roles.  Having gone the tank route last time, I was thinking about trying out the stabby role, since somebody found some epic daggers. Those came up because our base is just over the hill from a hostile settlement with a silver and a gold chest to farm.  We’ve gotten a couple of nice things out of those. We go raid the neighbors whenever we log in We also got to go through repair stations, respawns, and explosive barrels and how they freaking explode.  That last bit ended up getting demonstrated shortly thereafter when Skippy hit a stack of them and blew a big hole in the ground, killing himself and I.  Fortunately Potshot was far enough from the blast radius to survive and revive us. A chance to explain death But what I thought we would do was go get our first elixir well and shroud root, both to get us skill points and move us closer to double jump, but also to get the blacksmith off of our freaking backs.  He just keeps going on about it. We get it, we’re going This first elixir well was just in the shroud on the other side of the settlement, so we were passing through anyway.  We made our way into the shroud and found the well and the inevitable return beacon that sits atop each and every one.  Actually, this was the first time I had seen it called that. It is called a return beacon! I don’t think those new player helper texts were in the game when we started.  I’ve been calling them respawn points, though I did point out that their appearance is always a sign of some danger or other point of interest. We went down into the elixir well, which was quite sparsely populated.  I wondered if I needed to bump up mob density on the server for us to play as a group.  Then again, this was the first try, training wheels elixir well, so Potshot had me put a pin in that until we had more experience. Down the well we went, killed a few mobs, and found the shroud root. The training shroud root Skippy chopped it down and we all got our skill point reward, which was just enough for me to get double jump.  At least I had that going for me now. Having done that, we fast traveled back to base and updated the blacksmith. Give us credit man That gave us the task of getting to the first spire.  I hadn’t done the first spire puzzle on our original server, so we went in and did it together.  It was pretty much a sampler of many of the possible options, including a jumping puzzle over lava, in very simple form. That gave us our first spire that we could fast travel to and glide from.  The entry level glider doesn’t so much glide as plummet, but it still gets you some ways along.  We used that to go glide over to another elixir well, then took that out.  Then it was back up the spire to glide the other way to find the hunter, the next NPC on the list, and the one that would let us craft a few key items, including better arrows and the first backpack upgrade. We found him and got her setup in our base. She was in one of the capsules To get the backpack upgrade we needed a drying rack… also on the hunter’s construction list… and some salt, which Skippy and I went off to mine. The drying rack also let us dry berries, the current health regen food available to us.  That turns a one minute food into a ten minute food, so we piled berries into it to get ourselves setup. That led to the food discussion and a reposting of the food categories in Discord because whole food thing is… not impossible to divine, but also not obvious.  It is sort of like Valheim, but not. We ended up with our base moving along and some quests to go further afield.  The alchemist and the farmer are out there to be found.  But it feels like we’ll also be outgrowing our starter base pretty soon.  We’re considering possible locations.  We could use the same spot we did last time, which has the advantage of having farming fields.  However, as a location it is not very strategic.  I had an idea about setting up a base somewhere outside of easy glide distance from spires.  But the ruined towns and buildings don’t always line up.  Dare we make a clearing and start from scratch?",
