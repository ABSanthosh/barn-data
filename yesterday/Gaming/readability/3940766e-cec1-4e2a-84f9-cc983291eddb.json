  "text": "\"This is why I tell people to vote with their dollars.\" Image credit: Bethesda Softworks As Amazon's phenomenal TV adaptation of Fallout begins filming its second series, Fallout co-creator Tim Cain has opened up on why he thinks violence sells when it comes to AAA games, particularly RPGs. Over the New Year, Cain posted a video to YouTube about \"why so many AAA RPGs expect and often require the player to do combat\" and discussed \"whether or not games treat [violence] as the default\". Violence As The Default In AAA RPGs Violence As The Default In AAA RPGs.Watch on YouTube Acknowledging he's had \"pushback on similar answers in the past\", Cain then summarised his thoughts with: \"The TL;DR of it is, companies make games - and, in general, products - that people will buy. That's it\". \"It means games that sell the most - and I'm not even talking about review the best, just sell the most - will dictate future games. \"This is obvious. If you have a company and it's trying to make money and there's one game type that sells millions of copies and another one that sells a hundred thousand, which one are you going to do if they both take just as much time and money to develop? This is why I tell people to vote with their dollars,\" he added. And people who do choose to vote with their wallets won't just be a \"drop in the bucket\", Cain insisted. If enough people did the same, \"those drops become a storm and companies will listen\". \"Action genres tend to sell very well, and by that I mean, action RPGs kinda outsell classic RPGs, even though both of them are violent,\" he added. \"It's also easier to market those sorts of games. When you watch a trailer and you see people actually doing things - jumping, climbing, shooting, punching - it looks like: 'Whoa! Look at all the things you can do in that game' [...] It's hard to show the other things.\"How do we show that this game has a really good story? How do we show that it has fantastic dialogue? How do you do that in a trailer that may only be 15 or 30 seconds long?\" Cain said (thanks, PC Gamer). \"You have to reduce this wonderful narrative, that's super creative and nuanced that has a huge arc, down to a soundbite. And guess what? It's because most people won't watch more than a few seconds of something!\" As for that aforementioned Amazon Fallout show? Last month Walton Goggins slipped back into his Ghoulish guise to start filming the second season.",
