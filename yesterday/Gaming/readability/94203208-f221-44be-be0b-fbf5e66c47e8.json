  "text": "Magical influence.The fantasy genre has been inspiring and enchanting readers for hundreds of years. In 1858 Scottish author George MacDonald wrote Phantastes: A Faerie Romance for Men and Women, which is often thought of as the first \"modern\" fantasy novel. That perfectly titled book would go on to influence many of the authors that we consider some of our all time favorite authors. Lord Dunsany would be the next writer to reshape fantasy with one of JRR Tolkien's favorite books The King of Elfland's Daughter. In 2025 readers are just as enchanted and eager to escape into worlds that they can barely imagine, following their favorite writers down the rabbit hole to find strange and beautiful locations filled with surreal characters and never before seen creatures. So it's the perfect time to look back on some of the most influential fantasy authors of all time and explore just why they've made such an impact through the vibrant and imaginative stories that they've told. J.R.R. TolkienThere's no question that J.R.R. Tolkien is one of the most influential writers of all time, fantasy or not. His groundbreaking Lord of the Rings books revolutionized the fantasy genre and his world building and deftness at creating new languages have enraptured fans for almost a century. Inspiring everyone from George Lucas — who literally quotes The Hobbit in the original script for Star Wars — to iconic authors on our list like Ursula Le Guin and George R.R. Martin, Tolkien is almost synonymous with fantasy as he was one of its earliest breakthrough authors. Many of the things that you love about fantasy from the often religious overtones, to the gorgeous landscapes, and unique fictional languages, were all popularized by Tolkien and his sprawling works of Middle Earth. Even adaptations of his work have influenced others as Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films inspired a decade plus of fantasy imitators.C.S. LewisC.S. Lewis' enchanting tales of the mystical world of Narnia have had a magic-like hold on children's literature and fantasy since The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was first published in 1950. Over the next six years he would release six more books, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, The Horse and His Boy, The Magician's Nephew, and The Last Battle completing his Chronicles of Narnia series. Since their original publication the books have achieved the incredible feat of never going out of print with over 100 million copies in circulation in nearly 50 different languages. Interestingly Lewis cited Phantastes: A Faerie Romance for Men and Women as a huge influence on him, and the Narnia books would go on to inspire children around the world including some of your favorite authors like Bridge to Terabithia's Katherine Paterson. The series has been adapted multiple times, from the classic BBC TV specials to the Disney movies, and soon we'll be getting another version of the classic kids tales from the mind of Greta Gerwig at Netflix. Ursula Le GuinThis groundbreaking writer is behind some of the most acclaimed fantasy novels of all time. Her Earthsea series follows a young mage as he tries to find his place and freedom in the fictional world of Earthsea. The books made Le Guin the first woman to win both Hugo and Nebula awards for best novel, introducing her already popular books to an even wider audience. Philosophical and whimsical, Le Guin also inspired some of your favorite creators like Hayao Miyazaki and his son, the latter of whom would go on to adapt Earthsea to film.Ursala Le Guin wasn't just a leader in the fantasy field but she was also a famously radical thinker, imagining a better world not just on the pages of her stories but also in the lives of the people who read them. Even after her death in 2018 she regularly finds viral fame as people share videos and quotes of her optimistic thoughts on the end of Capitalism and hope for humanity. A powerful advocate and one of our great authors, Le Guin's work is still just as powerful in 2025.George R.R. MartinHis epic fantasy novels that encompass his Game of Thrones series are not only massively successful bestsellers but also changed the face of television forever introducing a new era of extremely high-budgets, extreme gore, and of course extreme nudity. What really makes him so influential though is his epic world building which has long been seen as some of the best that fantasy has to offer. From his sumptuous renditions of Westeros to his expansive fictional histories, texts, and ephemera, Martin loves to immerse readers in his worlds. Outside of the smash-hit cultural phenomenon of Game of Thrones, Martin has shaped both TV and Film writing on shows like the 00s reboot of The Twilight Zone, the cult smash Max Headroom, and the desperately underrated 1989 Beauty and the Beast series starring Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton! More recently his chilling supernatural noir Dark Winds was adapted at AMC and was already renewed for its fourth season.Octavia ButlerAlthough she has in recent years finally become widely recognized for her pioneering science-fiction prowess, Octavia Butler is also a vital part of the fantasy canon. Her breadth of imagination spanned from vampires to time travel and everything in between. Butler herself called her most well known book Kindred \"a kind of grim fantasy.\" And it's a great example of what makes her such a unique and trailblazing author. Butler is never afraid to bring real world experiences into her genre fiction, with her stories traversing time travel, vampires, and dystopias all the while melding these new worlds with the realities of racism and sexism. Her ability to deal with relatable issues while also building and imagining real futures make her one of the most influential and powerful genre authors of all time. And it's fantastic to see her finally being recognized as the trailblazer that she really is.Terry PratchettHis Discworld books took the cozy charm of Tolkien's hobbits and mixed it with absurdist comedy and vibrant fantasy. Never afraid to wrap some satirical commentary in with his wild worlds and magical creatures, Terry Pratchett has long been at the forefront of the now thriving cozy fantasy movement, and one of the most awarded-writers in fantasy full stop. Like many of the authors on our list, Pratchett didn't just create fictional worlds but he wanted to change our real one too. As he famously put it, \"Fantasy isn't just about wizards and silly wands. It's about seeing the world from new directions\", Pratchett saw fantasy as a tool for not only comfort and entertainment, but to open the reader's mind to different experiences and points of view. He was also an outspoken advocate for human rights causes and after his own Alzheimer's diagnosis, the right for people with terminal illnesses to die with dignity.Diana Wynne JonesOne of Pratchett's biggest inspirations, the author behind Howl's Moving Castle and the Chronicles of Chrestomanci is one of the most underrated authors on this list. Her children's books have nourished generations of rabid readers who want to traverse dreamworlds that they can imagine themselves in. Even those who don't instantly recognize her name have surely discovered her works thanks to a globally beloved adaptation in the shape of Studio Ghibli's fantasy masterpiece Howl's Moving Castle. It's not just readers whose minds she's shaped but authors too, as many readers believe that the boy who lived might never have existed if it wasn't for Jones' truly British take on magic, growing up, and discovering your own power.Rosie Knight is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything from anime to comic books to kaiju to kids movies to horror flicks.
