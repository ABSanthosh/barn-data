All transfers to Glamdring and Orcrist are temporarily unavailable. Housing remains unavailable to purchase, and we will announce when housing opens. -LOTRO Discord, Friday March 21, 2025 The wheel of server transfer time continues to weave an erratic and hapless pattern as SSG continues to try to work their way through this mess of their own making. Lord of the Rings Online I will say that I am glad that there is now an official LOTRO Discord server (find it here) and that the community team actually uses it.  Their usual methods of passing all but the most vitally important news used to be to bury it in an hour long video or post it deep in some thread on the forums.  And they still do that for a lot of stuff.  But for moderately important things they now announce them on the Discord server in the appropriate channel, to which I have subscribed via the TAGN Discord server so all their updates appear in the Daybreak Game News channel. You too can do this on your own Discord server.  It is actually a nice feature.  I hope it survives the Discord IPO. Anyway, we all continue to watch as SSG tries to untangle this mess of their own making.  It felt like the whole transfer thing, which will inevitably sunder friends and kinships and make many start afresh, was a fraught path to take.  But I am beginning to suspect that SSG felt the same way a decided that the inevitable breaking of fellowships that would ensue would be deterrent enough to keep the whole escapade from becoming at Middle-earth land rush. Basically, they felt they’d give people an option so crappy few would take them up on it. So we see how that turned out.  Everybody wants on the new servers and the promise of better performance, which should tell you something about how things were going on the 32-bit servers. Not that I have much to complain about.  Starting off with a new character, things have been okay… and likely better than running on any of the old 32-bit servers.  I even got a batch of characters transferred from an Landroval to Glamdring. But all of this made me open up Excel and start going through servers… once again, the launcher is bad, difficult to deal with, and gives no indication of where you might have left characters… one by one to track down any characters and record them in a single spreadsheet so I knew where I stood. As a starting point, here is what I have ended up with on Glamdring so far: Class Race Level Hunter Man 52 Champion Man 42 Guardian Dwarf 36 Runkeeper Elf 35 Hunter Man 31 Brawler Hobbit 27 Champion Man 14 Mariner Man 5 The classes highlighted in blue are the new characters I rolled up, with the hunter of that group clearly being my main. Doing his thing in the Lone Lands Out of that group I also have the following crafting professions: Farmer – Artisan Jeweler – Master Metalsmith – Master Scholar – Master Weaponsmith – Master Woodworker – Master Those are the level at which they have gotten into the second tier.  They are all into the first tier of the next level. I also have access to characters with harvesting levels to support those ranges.  That feels like a pretty good mix, enough to make me not think about making my hunter craft.  Harvest, yes, craft no. That leaves me with characters left on other servers.  I went through all the servers, save for the ones marked as “EU,” deleted any level 1-5 characters as not worth the effort, and came up with the following. At some point I played on Arkenstone.  I must have, because I have characters there.  But I had a very Gandalf response to finding this out. Me either man, me either Still, I found the following characters. Class Race Level Captain Man 31 Hunter Man 19 Warden Man 16 I did some work… that captain clearly made it through the Lone Lands… and there were two low level characters I deleted, but not much to work with.  Nobody was above journeyman in an of the crafting classes.  I can probably leave those be. Then there is Brandywine, which I do remember playing on at one point… though I cannot remember which generation of characters they really represented.  But here they are: Class Race Level Hunter Man 140 Captain Man 95 Champion Elf 34 Guardian Hobbit 32 Loremaster Man 16 Runkeeper Dwarf 15 The hunter and the captain are at their levels having taken advantage of free or discounted versions of The Monkey’s Paw of the Valar level boosters, which left them leveled up and yet unable to handle at level landscape mobs due to being handed completely inadequate legendary items.  I think I did that twice with the hunter, having found him in Rohan the first time firing Nerf arrows at orcs and unded and being defeated pretty much instantly.  I figured why not send him to 140?  If he’s going to be useless, he might as well be high level useless. As impressive… or not… as those levels may be, they don’t really come with the crafting to back them up.  There are a couple supreme’s on the harvesting side, but not so much on the crafting side. As noted, there were a few other low level strays, but I deleted them all so, when it comes to still live servers, I am spread across a mere three.  Not bad, given my history. But my ghosts of my history still lurk out there.  As part of the transfer process, we were also promised that, at some point, we would be able to transfer characters from no longer active servers. I suspect I have at least four servers worth of characters to examine once those become available.  There were at least two runs of the instance group… the launch group from the very first days of the game and a return group from probably the Cataclysm era.  Then there are the characters that I grouped up with the Podcasters of Bree (Firefoot? Was that even a server name?), where the VirginWorlds gang grouped up at one point, the Something Awful kinship I was in at one point, and the Kinship our EVE Online corp, Black Sheep Down, put together at one point. Of course, I have posts about some of those past servers.  There was the great server transfer event of 2015, because SSG doesn’t do merges, which lists out all the servers being closed. (Firefoot was a server name!)  I recognize names from that list.  Windfola was our server at launch. And I even have a summary of my kinships from a post back in 2013.  The Podcasters of Bree were on Nimrodel, not Firefoot.  So close that loop.  Our second instance group run at LOTRO was on Firefoot, with the much missed Murder for Shire kinship.  A lot of history to go through there.  I might end up with a summer reruns post about various attempts at the game. But that is a bridge to cross at a later date.  For now I am burning ahead with my hunter.",

hunter and the captain are at their levels having taken advantage of free or discounted versions of The Monkey’s Paw of the Valar level boosters, which left them leveled up and yet unable to handle at level landscape mobs due to being handed completely inadequate legendary items.  I think I did that twice with the hunter, having found him in Rohan the first time firing Nerf arrows at orcs and unded and being defeated pretty much instantly.  I figured why not send him to 140?  If he’s going to be useless, he might as well be high level useless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs impressive… or not… as those levels may be, they don’t really come with the crafting to back them up.  There are a couple supreme’s on the harvesting side, but not so much on the crafting side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs noted, there were a few other low level strays, but I deleted them all so, when it comes to still live servers, I am spread across a mere three.  Not bad, given my history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut my ghosts of my history still lurk out there.  As part of the transfer process, we were also promised that, at some point, we would be able to transfer characters from no longer active servers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suspect I have at least four servers worth of characters to examine once those become available.  There were at least two runs of the instance group… the launch group from the very first days of the game and a return group from probably the \u003cem\u003eCataclysm\u003c/em\u003e era.  Then there are the characters that I grouped up with the Podcasters of Bree (Firefoot? Was that even a server name?), where the VirginWorlds gang grouped up at one point, the Something Awful kinship I was in at one point, and the Kinship our \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e corp, Black Sheep Down, put together at one point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, I have posts about some of those past servers.  There was the \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2015/08/03/lotro-and-the-great-server-merge/\"\u003egreat server transfer event of 2015\u003c/a\u003e, because SSG doesn’t do merges, which lists out all the servers being closed. (Firefoot was a server name!)  I recognize names from that list.  Windfola was our server at launch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I even have \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2013/10/22/nbi-to-all-the-guilds-ive-loved-before/\"\u003ea summary of my kinships\u003c/a\u003e from a post back in 2013.  The Podcasters of Bree were on Nimrodel, not Firefoot.  So close that loop.  Our second instance group run at \u003cem\u003eLOTRO\u003c/em\u003e was on Firefoot, with the much missed Murder for Shire kinship.  A lot of history to go through there.  I might end up with a summer reruns post about various attempts at the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that is a bridge to cross at a later date.  For now I am burning ahead with my hunter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
