  "text": "From now through the end of March, AliExpress is hosting a US Anniversary Sale on locally shipped products, including video game consoles and accessories, computer peripherals, monitors, headphones, memory cards, gaming chairs, fitness equipment, and more. The products on sale are stocked in US-based warehouses, ship for free, and usually arrive to your door within one to two weeks, in stark contrast to products dropshipped from China that can take as long as a month or more and are sometimes tagged with outrageous shipping fees. In fact, AliExpress offers a refund on nearly all locally shipped products if your order doesn't arrive within 20 business days.AliExpress US Anniversary Sale (Locally Shipped Products)Is It Safe to Buy From AliExpress?AliExpress as a whole is a legitimate website, but since it is a marketplace comprised of individual sellers, you have to make sure that the vendor you're buying from is reputable. In many cases, the easiest way to do so is to look at the seller's rating and history. In terms of the products we've listed in this article, while it's true that some of the sellers may not have many reviews, AliExpress has reached out to us and personally vetted these vendors, which is why we feel comfortable promoting them. AliExpress also offers a 15 to 90 day free return policy depending on the product.US Anniversary Sale on Locally Shipped ProductsDon't Forget to Apply These Coupon CodesAliExpress often runs a suite of promo codes that generally don't have any product exclusions other than the usual tiered savings depending on how much you spend. Sometimes there's an extra incentive for new customers, but even returning buyers can usually find a coupon that applies on almost everything. Here are the ones that are available right now:IFP8WNN ($3 Off Orders $19+)IFPQHLH ($6 Off Orders $39+)IFP3TXY ($15 Off Orders $89+)IFP7FJZ ($25 Off Orders $159+)IFPI3V5 ($40 Off Orders $269+)IFPD5NS ($50 Off Orders $359+)IFPPVZR ($70 Off Orders $469+)IFPRZAZ ($100 Off Orders $599+)Xbox Elite Core Wireless Controller for $74.42AliExpress has dropped the price of the professional-grade Xbox Series X Elite Series 2 Core Wireless Controller to only $74.42 shipped after you apply coupon code \"IFP3TXY\" in cart. That's a huge price drop from its normal $140 list price and nearly the same cost as a standard Xbox controller. Note that this is a Hong Kong or Japanese import model in new retail packaging, but you won't find it cheaper anywhere else. Aside from the different color scheme, the Core controller is identical to the Xbox Elite Series 2 non-Core controller. The Core controller, however, does not include the component pack. AliExpress offers a 90-day return policy.Xbox Elite Wireless Controller for $100.29AliExpress also just dropped the price on a new retail boxed (imported) Xbox Series X Elite Series 2 wireless gaming controller – component pack included – to $100 shipped. This controller retails for $180 and the lowest price we've ever seen for this controller stateside is about $130-$140.Ecoflow Power StationsEcoflow sells their power stations on several different marketplaces including Amazon, Costco, Walmart, eBay, and even directly on its own site. However, if you want the best deals on new (not refurbished) products, you'll have to head on over to AliExpress. There, Ecoflow sells its products under the handle Ecoflow Local US Store. Their products ship from a local US-based warehouse and usually arrives within 3-5 days (past 20 days and you'll get a complete refund). Since Ecoflow itself is the seller, you're entitled to the 5 year factory warranty.LEGO Transformers Bumblebee 10338 for $68.70AliExpress is a good place to find LEGO sets at a discount, but just watch out for the knockoffs. Genuine listings always mention the word \"LEGO\" in their description. Imitation listings may show an item that looks just like the official LEGO set in the photos, but won't explicitly mention \"LEGO\" in the description, otherwise they get flagged by AliExpress. Also, if a price is way too be good to be true, it probably is. Don't buy a $100 LEGO set for $10 and come away with high expectations. The LEGO Bumblebee deal is a genuine product at a very good (albeit reasonable) price.Arzopa S1 15\" USB Portable Monitor for $57AliExpress has this Arzopa 15\" 1080p USB Type-C portable monitor for only $57 shipped after you apply coupon code \"IFPQHLH\". We've posted deals on this portable monitor in the past, but this is the lowest price we've seen thus far. The marketplace vendor is Arzopa itself so you're getting the full manufacturer's warranty. This monitor is primarily designed to be a secondary display for a laptop, but the S1's 1080p 60Hz panel is a great match for the Nintendo Switch's hardware, since the Switch only supports up to 720p @ 60Hz anyway.Arzopa Z1FC 16\" 144Hz USB Portable Monitor for $79For only $22 more, you can upgrade to the higher end Arzopa Z1FC USB portable monitor, now only $79.19 after coupon code \"IFPQHLH\". It's currently $117 on Amazon. The Z1FC's upgrades include a larger display (16.1\" vs 15.6\"), a higher refresh rate (144Hz vs. 60Hz), and better color reproduction (100% sRGB color gamut). This is a better monitor than the S1 to pair with the Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally because both gaming handhelds can support refresh rates up to 144Hz.New PlayStation 5 Slim Digital Console for $383AliExpress has currently listed a Sony PlayStation 5 Digital Edition console for $383.05 after you apply a $50 off coupon code \"IFPJIKZ\" during checkout. This is a genuine PlayStation console that's imported from Japan or Hong Kong; region locking is determined by your PlayStation account, not by console, so this system will play in the US without any problems. You'll also be able to select English as your default language just like any console you buy here.The PS5 had the best holiday ever last year, and it's not hard to see why. The PlayStation 5 console is current generation hardware capable of running games in 4K at up to 120Hz and – more importantly – it has an incredible library of games that includes excellent exclusives or timed exclusives like Astro Bot (2024 GOTY), Final Fantasy Rebirth, Spider-Man 2, God of War: Ragnarok, Horizon Forbidden West, Gran Turismo 7, and more. It's also backward compatible with PS4 games.Sony WH-1000XM5 Noise Canceling Headphones for $225If you're looking for an amazing pair of noise canceling headphones, AliExpress has the best deal on our favorite one. An imported pair of Sony WH-1000XM5 wireless noise canceling headphones is available for only $225 after coupon code \"IFP7FJZ\" is applied. In our glowing Sony WH1000XM5 review, Kevin Lee wrote that \"the Sony WH-1000XM5 is hands down the best sounding and most impressive noise-canceling headphones around. They demand a high premium but the cost of audio excellence is well worth it with this pair of headphones.\"Nintendo Switch Lite for $158.27Pick up a Nintendo Switch Lite handheld gaming system for only $135.91, compared to buying it for $200 at your local Best Buy or Gamestop. The Switch Lite is considerably cheaper than the Switch, yet is is compatible with the vast majority of Switch games, and it runs off the same hardware, so performance is identical. The three main tradeoffs of the Switch Lite are that the controllers are not detachable, the console can't be docked and played on a TV, and the display is smaller (5.5\" vs 6.2\" on Switch and 7\" on Switch OLED). AliExpress offers a 15-day return policy.Nintendo Switch OLED for $272.18If you're in the market for a new Switch console, here's a deal worth considering. AliExpress is currently offering a Nintendo Switch OLED console for only $272.18. This is a brand new, genuine Nintendo Switch OLED console in your choice of white or neon red/blue imported from either Japan or Hong Kong and comes with a 15-day return policy.Who Is AliExpress?AliExpress, an offshoot of Alibaba (one of the world's largest online retailers), is a one-stop shop for everything under the sun, from video games, consoles, and electronics to home decor, apparel, toys, and sporting goods. It operates as an online marketplace for Chinese-based sellers looking to sell their products to international customers. This is a great resource for US-based shoppers because prices on AliExpress are more often than not lower than the exact same product at a US retailer, including Amazon marketplace. These include officially licensed products from Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, and more. If you're willing to overlook some caveats (for example, imported models without a US warranty) and basic internet common sense (some prices are TGTBT), then AliExpress offers a great opportunity to save tons of money.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

It operates as an online marketplace for Chinese-based sellers looking to sell their products to international customers. This is a great resource for US-based shoppers because prices on AliExpress are more often than not lower than the exact same product at a US retailer, including Amazon marketplace. These include officially licensed products from Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, and more. If you\u0026#39;re willing to overlook some caveats (for example, imported models without a US warranty) and basic internet common sense (some prices are TGTBT), then AliExpress offers a great opportunity to save tons of money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eEric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
