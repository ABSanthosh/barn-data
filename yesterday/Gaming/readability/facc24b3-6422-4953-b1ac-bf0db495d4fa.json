  "text": "It’s no secret that iPads are some of the best tablets you can buy thanks to their reliability and versatility. But like most tablets, iPads aren’t immune from cracked screens, scratches, dents, and other superficial or fatal damage. One swift drop on a hard surface or too much knocking around in a bag could lead to the tablet's demise or a costly repair. A case is the easiest way to prevent catastrophe, and there are a whole range of options out there to choose from. Whether you're after something rugged, affordable, or feature-rich, we’ve got you covered.TL;DR – These Are the Best iPad Cases:Apple has a range of iPads big and small. However, this guide focuses exclusively on IGN’s top iPad model for most users, the 10.9-inch 10th generation iPad. Although the tablet is a few years old, its speedy A14 Bionic processor and 4GB of memory offer plenty of power to cruise through everyday tasks like scrolling socials, reading, streaming, and web browsing. That processor is paired with a stunning Liquid Retina display for sharp visuals, at and a fairly unbeatable price point, it's a great option for just about anyone.Giving your iPad a case not only ensures all of its precious features have an extra layer of protection against inevitable accidents, but some can even add more functionality. Almost all cases have a stand for hands-free viewing, while some offer extras like straps for easier handling, waterproofing to stay safe near the pool, or a keyboard to turn your iPad into a compact laptop. Below are the best cases for the 10th generation Apple iPad. If you happen to be seeking protection for a different iPad model, almost all of these selections are available in other sizes to fit just as well with the iPad Pro, iPad mini, and iPad Air.1. Apple Smart FolioBest iPad Case Apple Smart FolioKeep it in the Apple family with their screen cover that snaps easily on or off magnetically, offers a smart wake feature, and can roll into a handy stand.Compatible Apple iPad10th Generation iPad (10.9-inch)Size‎10.15\" x 7.41\" x 0.71\"Sleek, simple design that accents iPad wellSecure polyurethane coverDoesn’t protect back of iPadDo you live and breathe Apple? Then grab the screen cover the company designed specifically for the iPad. It’s nothing fancy but adds a bit of protection to the device without totally hiding the tablet's build. Color options for the Smart Folio case nicely accent the bright colorways of the iPad itself for a sleek, cohesive look. A downside, however, is that the Smart Folio case will only protect the screen. A dent or scratch on the back of the iPad may not be the end of the world, but a crack or chip in the front glass could spell the end of it, or at least a costly repair. (If you want 360° coverage, keep scrolling for plenty more durable case recs below.)Still, this cover provides an effective defense for the iPad’s screen with a polyurethane cover that snaps easily on or off magnetically. Since its an official Apple accessory, it has a smart wake and sleep feature, so your display automatically comes alive when opening the cover and goes off when closing it. The trifold design rolls up into different positions, turning into a stand for the iPad at different angles. 2. JETech CaseBest Budget iPad CaseJETech CaseCombining a hard polycarbonate with soft polyurethane, it holds up great over time while also absorbing shock.Compatible Apple iPad10th Generation iPad (10.9-inch)MaterialPolycarbonate, TPUIf you're fine with jumping from the Apple bandwagon, this JETech case is a brilliant alternative and an absolute steal — the sub-$15 price is hard to beat. Just like the top pick, it comes with a trifold cover and a range of color options. However, this case has a leg up on the Smart Folio: It provides protection for the back of your iPad too. The JETech case adds a hard shell that wraps around the sides and back of the tablet — it’s not just a screen cover — and that shock-absorbing material holds up great over time. All the essential ports and buttons are still accessible with the case on, and it's thin and lightweight to limit extra bulk. Of course, the magnetic front cover protects the display from scratches when not in use and folds up to act as a stand for watching shows or typing with an iPad keyboard. It also has an automatic toggle for the display to go to sleep when it's closed and wake up when it's open. 3. OtterBox Defender Series iPad CaseBest Rugged iPad CaseOtterbox Defender Series iPad CaseA case that can withstand a bit more abuse while keeping your iPad safe.Compatible Apple iPad10th Generation iPad (10.9-inch)MaterialPolycarbonate, synthetic rubberSize11.69\" x 8.19\" x 1.13\"Multi-layered drop protectionFeatures stand, lanyard slots, and Apple Pencil storageSome people are more prone to putting their devices in harm's way than others, whether it's butterfingers or constantly throwing the tablet in a stuffed bag. If that’s you, a case that can withstand pretty much anything is probably a good choice. The OtterBox Defender Series – part of the same family of cases that have protected phones and tablets for years – delivers the ultimate device protection.The OtterBox Defender is a combination of hard polycarbonate and soft, shock-absorbing rubber. It’s even passed the rigorous military testing standards for extra peace of mind. Port covers prevent dust and debris from getting in when the device isn't plugged in, and a built-in screen protector prevents potential scratching (and eliminates the need to buy a separate screen protector).Beyond protection, the OtterBox Defender includes storage for an Apple Pencil and a four-position stand to get the right angle for typing or streaming. Unfortunately, given amount of protection in this case, it is a bit clunky. But nothing beats it if you're looking for a solid defense against everyday accidents.4. Logitech Combo TouchBest Keyboard iPad CaseLogitech Combo TouchBeyond protection, this case has a backlit QWERTY keyboard cover and a trackpad for easier typing and text selection.Compatible Apple iPad10th Generation iPad (10.9-inch)MaterialWoven fabric, rubberSize9.97\" x 7.52\" x 0.76\"Reliable keyboard with good feedbackNot ideal for holding an Apple PencilWant something that does more than just protect your iPad? The Logitech Combo Touch case slaps on a backlit QWERTY keyboard with a trackpad. The spacing and feedback of the keys make for a pleasant typing experience. It’s no mechanical keyboard but gets the job done. The addition of a trackpad makes text selection a heck of a lot easier — no more fingers getting in the way of you seeing what you’re selecting. Pairing is also simple, as the keyboard and trackpad just click in and are powered by the iPad using Smart Connector technology. Still, all closed up the Logitech Combo Touch case provides an effective defense against the bumps and bruises of everyday use. Protection on all sides prevents scratches or spills while still sporting a thin and lightweight build for portablility.In addition to the keyboard, a kickstand makes for an easy-to-view typing position, essentially turning the tablet into a tiny laptop for modest tasks. The stand also folds over to sit low for easy stylus use, and the keyboard can be easily detached when it's not necessary. There’s even a slot to house the best Apple Pencil alternative, the Logitech Crayon. All these features, along with a lower price tag, make Logitech’s keyboard case come out ahead of Apple’s own Magic Keyboard Folio.5. Chesona Case with KeyboardBest Budget Keyboard iPad CaseCHESONA Case with KeyboardAn ultra-affordable keyboard and case combo to get more out of your iPad. Compatible Apple iPad10th Generation iPad (10.9-inch)MaterialPolycarbonate, fabricRemovable backlit keyboardLike the idea of the Logitech Combo Touch case but not the cost? The Chesona Case with Keyboard is about a quarter of the price, making it the perfect affordable alternative. It still offers a keyboard, a trackpad, and a stand, giving it 2-in-1 device capabilities. That keyboard is backlit for darker spaces and is magnetically attached for easy removal. Admittedly, the trackpad isn’t the most responsive, but it’s still a decent replacement when you're taking a break from the iPad's touch-screen functionality. Unfortunately, the Smart Connector technology found on the Logitech Combo Touch case isn’t available with the Chesona option. Instead, the keyboard connects to your iPad via Bluetooth. Still, pairing is simple and the connection is stable. That keyboard is also dependent on a rechargeable battery, which should last about five hours with the backlighting or 50 hours without.6. ESR Rotating Case with Removable Magnetic CoverBest iPad Case for Apple PencilESR Rotating Case with Removable Magnetic CoverWith its unique magnetic system, this ESR case is ready to hold your iPad in a range of positions.Compatible Apple iPad10th Generation iPad (10.9-inch)MaterialThermoplastic polyurethaneUnique, stable magnetic stand systemSecurely holds iPad at various anglesOne of the best features of any iPad is its support for the Apple Pencil, but not all cases are ideal for using it. Many kickstands and folding covers just aren’t sturdy enough to handle the pressure of the stylus, either falling over or collapsing. Plus, the angles for placing an iPad are limited. The ESR Rotating Case with Removable Magnetic Cover is built differently and ready to take on writing, sketching, and drawing needs. Rather than the typical folio design, this one has a back flap that magnetically attaches to the brackets on a removable magnetic cover, providing extra stability. Over six different angles are available for holding your iPad, and several are perfect for writing or drawing with the Apple Pencil. Thanks to its unique magnetic system, this ESR case makes it simple to switch your iPad between landscape mode, portrait mode, or raised 3.3 inches above the case’s stand. Of course, the ESR Rotating Case also keeps your iPad safe from occasional bumps and scratches with full 360° protection. A slot's included to hold the 1st-generation Apple Pencil or the USB-C Apple Pencil – the two Pencils supported by the 10th generation iPad – for easy storage. Just be prepared for the case to add a little extra weight to the device. 7. ProCase Kids CaseBest iPad Case for KidsProCase Kids CaseKids are prone to accidents, so this case that’s thick and lightweight with a handle is ideal for keeping the iPad safe.Compatible Apple iPad10th Generation iPad (10.9-inch)Size9.84\" x 7.48\" x 0.59\"Texturized design and built-in handle to prevent slippageThe 10th-generation iPad is one of the best iPads for kids, but accidents, especially with children, are inevitable. It’s imperative to pair the device with a heavy-duty case to keep it safe. The best one for the job is the ProCase Kids Case thanks to its thick, almost squishy layer of protection and affordability. The Kids Case is made of a hard, non-toxic EVA foam that keeps things feathery light while providing excellent shockproofing from drops and falls. It is a bit bulky, but the added cushioning raises the case above the tablet’s screen to prevent scratches and cracks. Some water resistance is built-in in case a drink is spilled. Despite the thick design, you still get access to the iPad’s ports, buttons, and speaker. Although this case keeps the iPad safe from occasional drops, a texturized design prevents it from slipping through a kid's fingers. What’s even better, a built-in handle makes it just a little easier to carry on the go. That handle doubles as storage for an Apple Pencil and folds to act like a stand for a hands-free mode. 8. Herize Rugged Protective CaseBest Handheld iPad CaseHerize Rugged Protective CaseA strap is on the back of this case, letting you slide your hand through to easily hold up your iPad.Compatible Apple iPad10th Generation iPad (10.9-inch)Size‎12.64\" x 9.88\" x 1.77\"Versatile, removable shoulder strapDebris can get under front coverRemember when Popsockets for your iPhone were all the rage? The Herize Rugged Protective Case is essentially that but on a larger scale with a few more features. Of course, given an iPad is much weightier than an iPhone, this case adds a strap to the back instead, which you just slide your hand through to easily hold your iPad up. The strap can be adjusted using a velcro to fit your hand and even spins 360 degrees for the ideal positioning. If the iPad does take a tumble – we’ve all done it – the Herize Rugged Protective Case has a hard shell with a silicone outer layer, helping to cushion the blow. A screen protector prevents direct surface contact with the display to avoid shattering the liquid retina display, but be prepared for occasional dirt and debris to get under that front cover. This case comes with a removable shoulder strap that you can place around your neck or throw over your shoulder, or wrapped around the headrest of a car seat for road trip entertainment. A kickstand is also included under the hand strap on the Herize Rugged Protective Case, but using the stand is a little difficult due to that positioning.9. Armor-X MXS-iPad-N5Best Underwater iPad CaseArmor-X MXS-iPad-N5With a thick, durable build and IP68 protection, this case can hold up to dunks in water up to 5 feet deep for 1 hour.Compatible Apple iPad10th Generation iPad (10.9-inch)Size10.28\" x 7.6\" x 0.98\"Hand strap for easier useDays spent on boats or even by the pool have the strong potential for accidental splashes or dunks, and the Armor-X MXS-iPad-N5 case keeps your iPad safe from potential bricking. The 10th-generation iPad has virtually no waterproofing, so even a little bit of water exposure in the wrong location could cause catastrophic damage. While no case can make your iPad truly impervious to liquid damage, this one goes a long way toward that goal.With IP68 waterproofing, the Armor-X MXS-iPad-N5 case can handle submersion in 5ft-deep water for up to one hour. Its full coverage, raised edge shell prevents scratches to the display or camera and is also ready to withstand drops up to almost 4ft, making this case ideal for harsher work environments. Armor-X adds some extra features, including a hand strap that doubles as a lanyard attachment for added security when holding an iPad. Similar to all the cases on this list, you get a kickstand, while the X-Mount adaptor allows you to attach the device to a range of Armor-X mounts for hands-free viewing. Best of all, you don't have to fuss with removing the case every time you want to charge your iPad, as there's a charging port that easily opens and closes as needed. The only major downfall is the lack of Touch ID support.Upcoming iPad Cases2024 saw updates to the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. We expect some iPad models to get a refresh to in 2025 as well, which could include the 10th-generation iPad this guide focuses on. However, nothing has been announced just yet – we'll know more (and hear more rumors) closer to Apple's next major conference. Of course, whenever new iPads hit the streets, a rush of new iPad cases comes with them. So, we'll update this guide to reflect the best cases for the latest devices. Stay tuned.What to Look for in an iPad CaseWhen purchasing an iPad case, the number one feature you should be looking for is protection. How much protection you need depends on how you plan to use the case. If you’re just going to leave your tablet at home most of the time and occasionally plop it in your bag to take on the go, you can get by with a screen cover or a more basic case with a thin, plastic shell and cover. However, when you want to take the device with you everywhere, or you bought the tablet for a child, it’s a good idea to grab something more rugged and durable featuring materials like rubber and polycarbonate. Maybe you want to do some work or reading by the pool or at the beach; there are waterproof cases to ensure your iPad stays safe from splashes and occasional dips in shallow water. After you determine the type of protection you need, functionality is an important consideration. There isn’t much to most iPad cases, but some add quality-of-life features like a built-in stand, handle, or keyboard. These stands often come in the form of a folio cover that folds over, letting you prop the iPad in either portrait or landscape mode, making it great for watching shows and movies. You can also find more robust stands on cases, but they will be pricier and bulkier. Though the pool is small, there are cases with handles and grips, making it easier to hold onto the iPad. Some case options offer large straps to slide your hand into so the device stays securely in your hand, while others have indents or molded areas of the case for you to grasp. Finally, adding a keyboard case to your iPad gives it functionality like a 2-in-1 laptop, so you can more efficiently type. If you don’t want the keyboard to be a part of the case, you can always grab a great travel keyboard to pair with your iPad.

The Herize Rugged Protective Case is essentially that but on a larger scale with a few more features. Of course, given an iPad is much weightier than an iPhone, this case adds a strap to the back instead, which you just slide your hand through to easily hold your iPad up. The strap can be adjusted using a velcro to fit your hand and even spins 360 degrees for the ideal positioning. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eIf the iPad does take a tumble – we’ve all done it – the Herize Rugged Protective Case has a hard shell with a silicone outer layer, helping to cushion the blow. A screen protector prevents direct surface contact with the display to avoid shattering the liquid retina display, but be prepared for occasional dirt and debris to get under that front cover.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eThis case comes with a removable shoulder strap that you can place around your neck or throw over your shoulder, or wrapped around the headrest of a car seat for road trip entertainment. A kickstand is also included under the hand strap on the Herize Rugged Protective Case, but using the stand is a little difficult due to that positioning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp id=\"best-underwater\"\u003e\u003ch2 data-cy=\"title2\" data-toc-title=\"Best underwater\"\u003e9.

The 10th-generation iPad has virtually no waterproofing, so even a little bit of water exposure in the wrong location could cause catastrophic damage. While no case can make your iPad truly impervious to liquid damage, this one goes a long way toward that goal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eWith IP68 waterproofing, the Armor-X MXS-iPad-N5 case can handle submersion in 5ft-deep water for up to one hour. Its full coverage, raised edge shell prevents scratches to the display or camera and is also ready to withstand drops up to almost 4ft, making this case ideal for harsher work environments. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eArmor-X adds some extra features, including a hand strap that doubles as a lanyard attachment for added security when holding an iPad. Similar to all the cases on this list, you get a kickstand, while the X-Mount adaptor allows you to attach the device to a range of Armor-X mounts for hands-free viewing. Best of all, you don\u0026#39;t have to fuss with removing the case every time you want to charge your iPad, as there\u0026#39;s a charging port that easily opens and closes as needed. The only major downfall is the lack of Touch ID support.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp id=\"upcoming-ipad-cases\"\u003e\u003ch2 data-cy=\"title2\" data-toc-title=\"Upcoming iPad cases\"\u003eUpcoming iPad Cases\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003e\u003ca data-cy=\"styled-link\" href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/wwdc-2024\"\u003e2024 saw updates\u003c/a\u003e to the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini.

So, we\u0026#39;ll update this guide to reflect the best cases for the latest devices. Stay tuned.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"what-to-look-for-in-an-ipad-case\"\u003e\u003ch2 data-cy=\"title2\" data-toc-title=\"What to look for in an iPad case\"\u003eWhat to Look for in an iPad Case\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eWhen purchasing an iPad case, the number one feature you should be looking for is protection. How much protection you need depends on how you plan to use the case. If you’re just going to leave your tablet at home most of the time and occasionally plop it in your bag to take on the go, you can get by with a screen cover or a more basic case with a thin, plastic shell and cover. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eHowever, when you want to take the device with you everywhere, or you bought the tablet for a child, it’s a good idea to grab something more rugged and durable featuring materials like rubber and polycarbonate. Maybe you want to do some work or reading by the pool or at the beach; there are waterproof cases to ensure your iPad stays safe from splashes and occasional dips in shallow water. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eAfter you determine the type of protection you need, functionality is an important consideration. There isn’t much to most iPad cases, but some add quality-of-life features like a built-in stand, handle, or keyboard. These stands often come in the form of a folio cover that folds over, letting you prop the iPad in either portrait or landscape mode, making it great for watching shows and movies. You can also find more robust stands on cases, but they will be pricier and bulkier. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eThough the pool is small, there are cases with handles and grips, making it easier to hold onto the iPad. Some case options offer large straps to slide your hand into so the device stays securely in your hand, while others have indents or molded areas of the case for you to grasp. Finally, adding a keyboard case to your iPad gives it functionality like a \u003ca data-cy=\"styled-link\" href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-in-1-laptops\"\u003e\u003cu\u003e2-in-1 laptop\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, so you can more efficiently type.
