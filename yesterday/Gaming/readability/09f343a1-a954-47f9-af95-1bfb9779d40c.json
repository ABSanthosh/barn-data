  "text": "Time for another annual round up, this time around the books I read in 2024. The year 2024 is almost up I record my reading over at Goodreads.  I understand that the site is now under something of a cloud as people have realized Amazon owns it, because some tech oligarch needs to own everything these days.  But I am a creature of habit and continue to use the place.  And the joke is on Amazon.  I use a different email address/identity on Goodreads than I do on Amazon/Audible, so they can’t quite bundle all of my data to use against me. As always, this post is triggered by the yearly Goodreads activity roundup.  They summed up my year as such. My 2024 reading That chart is a bit of a lie in that I will swear to you that I did in fact start 28 books this year… but I cannot say that I finished them all.  Looking at my list of books from 2024 I would say that there are at least four that I didn’t get very far into.  Everything gets 100 pages… but after that if it has not grabbed me I might wander off. I also find that my longest and shortest titles make for an odd pair.  The short end, a critique of Kissenger who lived to be 100… so the title should give you a clue as to the opinions within… while the long end of the spectrum is the third book in the three volume biography of Churchill that I will get to mentioning in a bit. Each year I spend a minute looking down the list and try to pick out five books that I want to mention.  Some years I am more successful than others.  This year I think I have managed it… though I’ll get to some honorable mentions. My Five Books of 2024 Gorky Park I think I read Gorky Park when it came out in paperback, which would put me in high school as the film version came out when I was a freshman in college.  Maybe.  That was a long time ago, so maybe I read it after the film came out.  The worn paperback, which I still have, has a print run date that could accommodate either scenario. The book is a murder mystery set in Moscow in the late Brezhnev era of decay and follows investigator Arkady Renko, an honest detective in a corrupt totalitarian state… I seem drawn to those sorts of books, titles like March Violets, Fatherland, SS-GB, and the like where the state is as much of a problem for the investigation as the perpetrator… is a tale of murder, corruption, and cover up.  I mean, aren’t they all? The book was popular enough that it spawned a decent film and another nine sequels, which I am working my way through.  The next two, Polar Star and Red Square, were both on par.  The later books do not hold up quite as well… also, Arkady seems to time shift a bit, aging more slowly than the world around him in order to keep pace with the changes in Russia.  A decent series and I recommend the first three books for sure. The Last Lion As mentioned above, this is the third book in William Manchester’s massive biography of Churchill, and one I thought I would never get to read.  After the first two Manchester had a stroke and could not longer write.  He had done all the research but could not form the words.  I was struck by this turn of events because Churchill’s life was an adventure that led up to his time as Prime Minister during the war.  So I gave up on the idea of the tale ever being finished in Manchester’s amazing style. And then a year or so back I stumbled across the third book, complete… finished with a collaborator who could at least imitate the style required.  And it is quite the tale that goes deep into details of Churchill during the war years.  Those years make up the bulk of the nearly 1,200 pages and explore in depth both his flare for achieving things as well as some of the odd to bizarre ideas he had during the conflict.  The post-war years are covered, but peace is not as gripping as war and the stories that run through the 50s are not as interesting. All in all I was happy to have had the chance to read the third book… more than 20 years after I read the first two.  Still, probably a title for somebody who wants to really get inside of Churchill and the war years as opposed to anyone interested in a neatly summed up overview of the man. Burn Book Kara Swisher has a divisive style.  People like her or hate her, with little in between as she tells the tales as she sees them with little interest in fan boy illusions about the pillars of tech.  I like Silicon Valley dirt and her book is up there with Accidental Empires and In Search of Stupidity for people who want some of the unflattering history of the valley. The only caveat is that, while those two titles are focused on companies and people in the valley, Burn Book is very much focused on Kara Swisher.  It is more an autobiography that includes experience with tech titans that a focus on tech, but still essential reading for those interested in the history of this place. (Meanwhile, in looking up In Search of Stupidity I see there is a new, expanded edition that I will need to pick up.  That might make next year’s list.) The Napoleonic Wars Do you love Napoleonic battles?  Can you name all the major cities contested in the peninsula campaign?  Does the tale of the 100 days thrill you?  Have you seen Waterloo more than once just to see the epic aerial shots capturing Soviet troops dressed in period uniforms forming up in regimental squares to fend off charging cavalry? Well, this probably isn’t the book for you as it covers pretty much everything that happened during the Napoleonic wars besides the actual battles.  Economics, politics (both local and international), negotiations, the stance and views of small and neutral parties along with the struggle in the new world and various other colonial domains.  There is a long chapter covering the relationship between the Ottomans and the various belligerents. It is absolutely brilliant if you want to know what the hell was going on outside of battle during the era.  I nearly did a spit take when, at one point, the battles of Jena and Auerstedt were mentioned and dismissed in a single sentence as the author went back to the internal divisions within the German principalities.  Excellent stuff… if this is your kind of thing. The Innocents Abroad My grandmother read me sections of this Mark Twain travelog when I was a child and in the new year I felt the urge to return to this tome.  It covers Twain’s trip excursion with a group of wealthy Americans to France, the Papal States, the Black Sea and Russia, and the Holy Lands, through all of which Twain is a grumpy cynic, mocking the customs of the locals and the ignorance of his fellow passengers, never sparing himself when it was his turn, as they inflict themselves on a series of locations and on each other when confined to the ship.  There is no pompous declaration that he could not make somebody regret. I liked Twain when I was young, but I think he speaks much more so to grumpy old me… though he was barely into his 30s when he wrote it.  If he were alive today he would be a top tier internet troll.  His engagement farming would be unmatched.  Anyway, something good to return to in this age when we think we invented sarcasm and irony. Honorable Mentions As noted above, Good Reads says I went through more than five books and it is always a challenge to pick just five.  After all, my first entry above managed to encompass two more books before I finished it.  So I have a few to mention in addition to the above. First up is Recoding America: Why Government Is Failing in the Digital Age and How We Can Do Better, which is all about how applications are handled at government agencies.  I covered a bit of this in a post previously, though I mostly focused on how business views government budgets as their right, that the government should only ever buy things and never make anything, and how billionaires who complain about taxes center their fortunes on fat government contracts.  My daughter bought me this book and when I read it I could do little but agree with most of what was said.  Interesting, if you want to read up on that sort of thing, but also a bit of a niche interest.  As we have learned over the last decade or two, most people do not know or care what the government does… until it impacts them. Then, for some light entertainment I picked up Anne Applebaum’s Autocracy Inc., which is about how the world’s autocrats and dictators have decided that, while they might hate each other, they all hate democracy even more and find ways to cooperate to undermine it.  Nothing pleases them more than democracy failing to provide a positive alternative to dictatorship.  On top of that I read Annie Jacobsen’s Nuclear War: A Scenario… and talk about ways to ignite the anxieties of youth.  I was a bit obsessed with this sort of thing during the Cold War, what happens when a nuke hits.  While it tracks with other sources I have read, including US policy that people like Daniel Ellsberg have previously documented, it has also received quite a bit of criticism from people for whom Tom Clancy novels seem accurate.  Still, you don’t want to be in the neighborhood when a nuke hits… or maybe you do, as that would be quick relative to radiation poisoning or starvation when the economy collapses and we find out that Fallout is fun as a game but less so as a reality. Finally, after the election I felt like I really needed some escapism, so I picked up The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and went through that.  I wanted to put myself into a world with problems that had solutions.  I mean, destroy the ring, job done!  Sure, there are things in the way, but the outcome seems more likely than fixing our world.  I couldn’t quite get myself into the next two books so went back to Arkady Renko novels. Anyway, that was my year in reading.  You can see the whole list over on Good Reads if you’re into that sort of thing. Now to see what I pick up for 2025.  If things get really bad I’ll probably regress back to Douglas Adams for escapism.

above, this is the third book in William Manchester’s massive biography of Churchill, and one I thought I would never get to read.  After the first two Manchester had a stroke and could not longer write.  He had done all the research but could not form the words.  I was struck by this turn of events because Churchill’s life was an adventure that led up to his time as Prime Minister during the war.  So I gave up on the idea of the tale ever being finished in Manchester’s amazing style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then a year or so back I stumbled across the third book, complete… finished with a collaborator who could at least imitate the style required.  And it is quite the tale that goes deep into details of Churchill during the war years.  Those years make up the bulk of the nearly 1,200 pages and explore in depth both his flare for achieving things as well as some of the odd to bizarre ideas he had during the conflict.  The post-war years are covered, but peace is not as gripping as war and the stories that run through the 50s are not as interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all I was happy to have had the chance to read the third book… more than 20 years after I read the first two.  Still, probably a title for somebody who wants to really get inside of Churchill and the war years as opposed to anyone interested in a neatly summed up overview of the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBurn Book\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara Swisher has a divisive style.  People like her or hate her, with little in between as she tells the tales as she sees them with little interest in fan boy illusions about the pillars of tech.  I like Silicon Valley dirt and her book is up there with \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_Empires\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eAccidental Empires\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1191767.In_Search_of_Stupidity\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e In Search of Stupidity\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e for people who want some of the unflattering history of the valley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only caveat is that, while those two titles are focused on companies and people in the valley, \u003cem\u003eBurn Book\u003c/em\u003e is very much focused on Kara Swisher.  It is more an autobiography that includes experience with tech titans that a focus on tech, but still essential reading for those interested in the history of this place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Meanwhile, in looking up \u003cem\u003eIn Search of Stupidity\u003c/em\u003e I see there is a new, expanded edition that I will need to pick up.  That might make next year’s list.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24966135-the-napoleonic-wars\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Napoleonic Wars\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you love Napoleonic battles?  Can you name all the major cities contested in the peninsula campaign?  Does the tale of the 100 days thrill you?  Have you seen \u003cem\u003eWaterloo\u003c/em\u003e more than once just to see the epic aerial shots capturing Soviet troops dressed in period uniforms forming up in regimental squares to fend off charging cavalry?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, this probably isn’t the book for you as it covers pretty much everything that happened during the Napoleonic wars besides the actual battles.  Economics, politics (both local and international), negotiations, the stance and views of small and neutral parties along with the struggle in the new world and various other colonial domains.  There is a long chapter covering the relationship between the Ottomans and the various belligerents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is absolutely brilliant if you want to know what the hell was going on outside of battle during the era.  I nearly did a spit take when, at one point, the battles of Jena and Auerstedt were mentioned and dismissed in a single sentence as the author went back to the internal divisions within the German principalities.  Excellent stuff… if this is your kind of thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innocents_Abroad\"\u003eThe Innocents Abroad\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy grandmother read me sections of this Mark Twain travelog when I was a child and in the new year I felt the urge to return to this tome.  It covers Twain’s trip excursion with a group of wealthy Americans to France, the Papal States, the Black Sea and Russia, and the Holy Lands, through all of which Twain is a grumpy cynic, mocking the customs of the locals and the ignorance of his fellow passengers, never sparing himself when it was his turn, as they inflict themselves on a series of locations and on each other when confined to the ship.  There is no pompous declaration that he could not make somebody regret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI liked Twain when I was young, but I think he speaks much more so to grumpy old me… though he was barely into his 30s when he wrote it.  If he were alive today he would be a top tier internet troll.  His engagement farming would be unmatched.  Anyway, something good to return to in this age when we think we invented sarcasm and irony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHonorable Mentions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs noted above, Good Reads says I went through more than five books and it is always a challenge to pick just five.  After all, my first entry above managed to encompass two more books before I finished it.  So I have a few to mention in addition to the above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst up is \u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61796680-recoding-america\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRecoding America: Why Government Is Failing in the Digital Age and How We Can Do Better\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, which is all about how applications are handled at government agencies.  I covered a bit of this in a post previously, though I mostly focused on how business views government budgets as their right, that the government should only ever buy things and never make anything, and how billionaires who complain about taxes center their fortunes on fat government contracts.  My daughter bought me this book and when I read it I could do little but agree with most of what was said.  Interesting, if you want to read up on that sort of thing, but also a bit of a niche interest.  As we have learned over the last decade or two, most people do not know or care what the government does… until it impacts them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, for some light entertainment I picked up Anne Applebaum’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/183932735-autocracy-inc\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eAutocracy Inc.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, which is about how the world’s autocrats and dictators have decided that, while they might hate each other, they all hate democracy even more and find ways to cooperate to undermine it.  Nothing pleases them more than democracy failing to provide a positive alternative to dictatorship.  On top of that I read Annie Jacobsen’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/182733784-nuclear-war\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eNuclear War: A Scenario\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e… and talk about ways to ignite the anxieties of youth.  I was a bit obsessed with this sort of thing during the Cold War, what happens when a nuke hits.  While it tracks with other sources I have read, including US policy that people like Daniel Ellsberg have previously documented, it has also received quite a bit of criticism from people for whom Tom Clancy novels seem accurate.  Still, you don’t want to be in the neighborhood when a nuke hits… or maybe you do, as that would be quick relative to radiation poisoning or starvation when the economy collapses and we find out that \u003cem\u003eFallout\u003c/em\u003e is fun as a game but less so as a reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, after the election I felt like I really needed some escapism, so I picked up \u003cem\u003eThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\u003c/em\u003e and went through that.  I wanted to put myself into a world with problems that had solutions.  I mean, destroy the ring, job done!  Sure, there are things in the way, but the outcome seems more likely than fixing our world.  I couldn’t quite get myself into the next two books so went back to Arkady Renko novels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, that was my year in reading.  You can see \u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/9598766-wilhelm-arcturus\"\u003ethe whole list over on Good Reads\u003c/a\u003e if you’re into that sort of thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow to see what I pick up for 2025.  If things get really bad I’ll probably regress back to Douglas Adams for escapism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePast annual
