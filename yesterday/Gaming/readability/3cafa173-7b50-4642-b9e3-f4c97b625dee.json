  "text": "Image credit: Kinetic Games Kinetic Games has confirmed Phasmophobia's next content drop, Chronicle, will release on 24th June, and it'll be its \"biggest update yet\". As well as introducing a \"total overhaul\" of how evidence is collected, the team said Chronicle will expand investigations with three new evidence types, a completely redesigned Journal, reworked levelling and progression, a refreshed Main Menu UI, and \"many eerie surprises still lurking in the dark\". Phasmophobia - Console Launch Trailer Phasmophobia - Console Launch Trailer.Watch on YouTube But at the \"heart\" of the Chronicle update is the debut of the all-new Sound evidence. An entirely new haunting paranormal proof type can be captured through the new Sound Recorder, bringing \"a new dimension to gameplay, revealing subtle clues that might otherwise be drowned out by terrified screams\". Available in the customary three upgrade tiers, players will be able to record audio from ghost events, Spirit Box responses, and Paranormal Sounds like those detected by the Parabolic Microphone. It's this new evidence type that's necessitated a Journal upgrade, too. The Photo tab will be rebranded as \"Media\", and keep all your photos, videos, and new sound recordings in one place. Importantly, you'll have to fill your journal with all these unique media types, including \"EMF spikes to ghostly interactions and fleeting glimpses of otherworldly forms\", to complete a \"perfect\" investigation. Image credit: Kinetic Games \"Chronicle will also introduce a revamped media quality system,\" Kinetic teased. \"The first evidence capture of any media type will be marked as 'Unique', granting extra cash and XP rewards at the end of each contract. Any subsequent captures of the same evidence type will be classed as 'Duplicates', offering smaller rewards. The new system will also add tier bonuses based on the equipment used and adds all media captures into the Reward Multiplier, making every shot, sound, and sight count even more toward player’s final payouts.\" Don't forget that this year, Phasmophobia will also rework Grafton Farmhouse, following Bleasdale Farmhouse's recent overhaul. Before then, though, we'll also get to see the new levelling and progression system and Main Menu UI when Chronicle arrives at the end of June. The ghost-hunting sim has sold two million copies on console since it came out of early access last October, bringing the total sales across all platforms to 22 million. The development team recently outlined the road ahead for the spooky sim in 2025, confirming map reworks, new ghost-hunting equipment, \"thrilling seasonal events\", and a brand-new location, too.",
