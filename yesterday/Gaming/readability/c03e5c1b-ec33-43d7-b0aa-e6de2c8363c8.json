  "text": "Abyss Vaulter has players hopping their way up through a sinkhole filled with monsters. Thankfully there’s weapons and an economy down here. You have fallen down into a huge pit and somehow survived the long, long fall on the way down there. Also, a gun has fallen down with you. Both of these things are very unfortunate for the creatures living down here, as they all seem to be made of valuable gems and you’re determined to blast your way out of here while collecting bejewelled riches along the way. Considering you’re the one who stumbled into their underground home, your behavior is pretty sketchy. But it’s also really fun? I am thinking I might just be a terrible person. You’ve got a long climb ahead of you as you crawl out of this pit. You can string a few jumps together before you hit the ground, though, making you highly mobile as you work your way through the rough terrain. Your gun has infinite ammo for you to cause trouble for these critters, but there are also a variety of upgrades lying around down here that make your gun even more of a menace with lasers, rockets, and homing shots. Considering most of the wildlife is pretty tame, it can often feel like overkill. And it gets even wilder when you collect gems from your fallen “enemies” to use in the shop to buy even stronger upgrades for yourself. You’re a real menace down here. Abyss Vaulter is, despite my mixed feelings about blasting wildlife in its depth, a really enjoyable, playful platformer that offers a ton of great upgrades that keep it entertaining during its brief playtime. It’s a perfect bite-sized experience for when you just want to feel powerful and do some cool jumps. Abyss Vaulter is available now on itch.io.
