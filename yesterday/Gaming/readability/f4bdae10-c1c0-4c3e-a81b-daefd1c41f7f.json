  "description": "We're four years into the current Xbox Series X|S generation, and in 2024, it was business mostly as usual for Microsoft's console brand. While the biggest news this year related to Xbox was a new focus on bringing several of its first-party games to PS5 and Nintendo Switch, Xbox also saw an evolution of its Game Pass subscription service and an option for users of the Ultimate tier to stream select games they own. On top of a marketing push designed to remind people that they technically don't need the console to play Xbox games, 2024 shaped up to be a year of diversification for Microsoft's gaming ecosystem.What of the games then? This was a pretty strong year overall, as the Xbox library was bolstered with first-party games like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl. Third-party games like Neon White and Final Fantasy 14 only added to the appeal of sitting down for a night of gaming on an Xbox console, and with Game Pass having numerous day-one releases, you'd find yourself spoiled for choice on what you could download and play, especially when one of those options was Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.GameSpot sister Metacritic has crunched the numbers on the best-reviewed Xbox games of the year--as of December 5--and if you're interested, you can check them all out in the list below. There were a few obvious winners here, as well as several surprises that you can read about. Be sure to also check out our running lists of the best Xbox Series X|S games and best Xbox Game Pass games to play right now.More Best Of 2024:Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024Best Xbox Games Of 2024Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024Best Of 2024 hub Elden Ring: Shadow of the ErdtreeMore Elden Ring is never a bad thing, and Shadow of the Erdtree delivers on that idea with an extra dose of everything that made the original game one of From Software's greatest hits. Elegantly grim and endlessly challenging, it's an essential expansion for any Elden Lord looking to return to the Lands Between.Metascore: 95 | Read our Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review See at Amazon Like a Dragon: Infinite WealthRGG Studio has been on a roll over the last couple of years, and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is a prime example of the studio playing to its strengths. Doubling down on the turn-based gameplay mechanics introduced in Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Infinite Wealth is a confident sequel that further refines its weird and wonderful formula of brawls, drama, and mystery.Metascore: 92 | Read our Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth review See at Amazon Metaphor ReFantazioA fantasy adventure that embodies the best qualities of Atlus-developed games, Metaphor: ReFantazio was GameSpot's Game of the Year. At its core, it's an idealistic and hopeful look at the power of fiction backed up by stunning art direction and challenging combat. Throw in political intrigue and a colorful cast of characters, and you've got a game that'll keep you entertained throughout its lengthy tale.Metascore: 92 | Read our Metaphor: ReFantazio review See at Amazon Shin Megami Tensei V: VengeanceFor its arrival on Xbox consoles, Atlus pulled out all the stops to make the already-superb Shin Megami Tensei V a must-play JRPG. Technical refinements and quality-of-life changes to remove tedious grinding sessions made for some welcome improvements, but this edition of the game is also a massive expansion that adds in dozens of hours of new story content. It took a long time for this entry in the cult-classic Shin Megami Tensei series to make its way to Xbox, but the wait was definitely worth it.Metascore: 92 | Read our Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance review See at Amazon Tekken 82024 was a year of rebirth for Tekken 8, as the fighting game series reinvented itself. On the surface, it's still a good-looking brawler with a varied roster of warriors that'll appeal to series veterans, but under the hood, Tekken 8 hit the sweet spot for drawing in some fresh blood with its aggressive gameplay mechanics and easy-to-learn fundamentals. A hard-hitting arcade fighting game fused with modern sensibilities, Tekken doesn't get much better than this.Metascore: 89 | Read our Tekken 8 review See at Amazon Destiny 2: The Final ShapeThe Final Shape brought a satisfying conclusion to the 10-year story of Destiny, culminating in a fight against The Witness, the foe who has loomed in the shadows since the beginning. The new Prismatic subclass further expands on the RPG-style character building, letting you mix and match abilities in exciting new ways. With a great raid, improvements to numerous areas of the game, a terrific--and comprehensible!--story, a fun new area to explore, and so much more to digest, The Final Shape is arguably the best Destiny expansion ever.Metascore: 89 | Read our Destiny 2: The Final Shape review Neon WhiteAlthough late to arrive on Xbox--it was originally released in 2022--Neon White is still every bit as good and original now as it was at the time. One of 2022's best games, Neon White turns you into a speedrunner, as you race through levels defeating enemies and making for the finish line. But what sets it apart is the way in which guns function as both weapons and platforming abilities, as you'll need to discard them in order to perform actions like a one-off double-jump. This leads to a thrill ride where you're constantly pushing forward, making quick decisions about how and when to make use of your limited weapons to finish levels as quickly as possible.Metascore: 88 | Read our Neon White review Indiana Jones and the Great CircleWolfenstein developer MachineGames has nailed the brief for crafting an Indiana Jones game. Capturing the scrappy underdog spirit of the beloved film franchise, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle combines masterfully crafted puzzles with rip-roaring action and a cinematic presentation that does justice to the whip-wielding adventurer.Metascore: 87 | Read our Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review See at Amazon Prince of Persia: The Lost CrownThe Prince of Persia series had been ice for years, with the wait extended due to many delays for the Sands of Time remake, but Ubisoft had something else up its sleeve in 2024. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown reimagines the series as a metroidvania, complete with an innovative breadcrumb system to stop you from wasting time looking for that one door you found five hours ago. With a snappy, intuitive combat system and great platforming, it's a worthy entry in a series that had been all but forgotten.Metascore: 87 | Read our Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review See at Amazon NevaFrom the team that made Gris, an artful meditation on grief, comes Neva, which tells a somber story of its own. Though the 2D style and similar color palette might inform dedicated indie fans that this is the Gris team, Neva's story is vastly different, focusing on a dying fantasy world where an unnamed character struggles to save the land using the help of her animal companions. Wordlessly, and with the aid of beautiful music, Neva reminds us that this would of ours is both our only home, as well as the home to so many others, and that saving it is a fight worth enlisting in.Metascore: 87 Unicorn OverlordUnicorn Overlord is the kind of game that requires dedication. A beautifully crafted fantasy epic with an incredibly deep and complex battle system, the game is a rewarding experience for anyone willing to dedicate time and effort into mastering every facet of its design. While the story might have more tropes than an Isekai anime, the colorful cast of characters, rich lore, and vibrant lands makes this game a top-tier strategy-RPG.Metascore: 87 | Read our Unicorn Overlord review See at Amazon Botany ManorIf you want a change of pace from all the shooting and slashing offered by most games, maybe you'd like to manage a picturesque English garden? Botany Manor is a chill vibes puzzle game that has you carefully cultivating a variety of magical plants, giving you a wholesome and cozy way to unwind.Metascore: 82 Persona 3 Reload2024 was an incredible year for Atlus, as it got off to a start with a remake of one of its darkest Persona games. Persona 3 Reload isn't just a massive overhaul of a PS2 classic, it's a game full of small changes that lead to big changes across the board for this emotionally charged tale of death and rebirth. The core of Persona 3 remains intact in this remake, with its best qualities enhanced by slick graphics, a talented cast of voice actors, and a killer soundtrack.Metascore: 86 | Read our Persona 3 Reload review See at Amazon Dragon's Dogma 2Fans of The Elder Scrolls, The Witcher, and other major fantasy RPGs may hope to dive into Dragon's Dogma 2 (DD2), and perhaps they should, but ultimately it's the game's strange quirks that make it both somewhat off-putting to some, and yet incredibly mesmerizing to others. In DD2, players will investigate a conspiracy, enlist unique NPC allies called Pawns, and, naturally, fight dragons amid a campaign that feels like a D\u0026D campaign come to life. But it's the game's elusive true ending that makes the game so special in the end.Metascore: 86 | Read our Dragon's Dogma 2 review See at Amazon Dragon Age: The VeilguardFollowing a few high-profile misses, including the dead-in-the-water Anthem, BioWare needed a hit to turn things around. The studio got it with Dragon Age: The Veilguard, an excellent RPG that feels like a natural evolution for the long-running series. An emphasis on combining attacks with your allies turns every battle into a glorious mix of arrows, blades, and explosions, and BioWare's certainly created some of the most memorable characters in the series to date. Ally yourself with a necromancer who dreams of becoming a spooky skeleton man or take on a titular dragon with a fire-breathing hunter by your side. Or just focus on finding the stupidest-looking hats imaginable. The choice is yours.Metascore: 85 | Read our Dragon Age: The Veilguard review See at Amazon Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the GoddessKunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is a bold experiment, one that successfully merges multiple genres together into a cohesive and gorgeous package. While the objective of guiding a fair maiden to a shrine is simple, the journey is anything but easy as you're forced to contend with monsters pulled from the darkest chapters of Japanese folklore. It's an experimental approach to storytelling and strategic action that ultimately pays off, creating an experience that's refreshing to dive into.Metascore: 84 | Read our Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess review See at Amazon Cat Quest 3Do you like cats? Do you like quests? Then Cat Quest 3 will definitely scratch that highly specific itch to see feline adventurers set on a high-seas adventure and explore dangerous dungeons. A breezy and cozy game, Cat Quest 3 keeps things simple while adding to its appeal with well-crafted sailing and co-op gameplay mechanics. It's not a revolution in its genre, but with its old-school charm, colorful graphics, and witty writing, it's a comfortably familiar game that's easy to pick up.Metascore: 84 See at Amazon Still Wakes the DeepWhat if John Carpenter's The Thing was set not in a science facility in Antarctica but instead an oil rig in Scotland? The results would be something quite like Still Wakes the Deep. This first-person horror-adventure game comes from The Chinese Room, the team behind Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, and will appeal most of all to fans of isolated horror like Alien and Carpenter's aforementioned masterpiece. With a monster you really should see for yourself, Still Wakes the Deep may flood your thoughts like the beast does to the doomed rig.Metascore: 83 | Read our Still Wakes the Deep review Dragon Ball: Sparking ZeroAbsence makes the heart grow fonder, and when it comes to big beefy anime dudes throwing hands that can level entire continents, Dragon Ball's return to its Budokai Tenkaichi era makes you realize just how much you missed classic arena-fighting action. While it could do a better job explaining its more nuanced gameplay mechanics, Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero still excels at being a stylish brawler with plenty of substance.Metascore: 83 | Read our Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero review See at Amazon WWE 2K24Several years after WWE 2K20 temporarily put the annual series on ice, the sports entertainment franchise has bounced back into the main event spotlight. WWE 2K24 doesn't offer any surprises, but if you've laced up your boots for a good-looking round of high-flying action, refined gameplay, and a trip down memory lane with a Showcase mode focused on WrestleMania’s greatest moments, you won't be disappointed.Metascore: 83 | Read our WWE 2K24 review See at Amazon Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2It seemed like a sequel to the cult-favorite Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine was never going to happen, but Saber Interactive answered our prayers--even though they were meant for the Emperor of Mankind. Space Marine 2 is a brilliant sequel that, much like the original, mixes third-person shooting with enormous hack-and-slash brawls. Though the campaign missions are fairly linear, they're complemented by gigantic, explosive set pieces that turn out to be much more than decoration--these moments you see in the distance are actually full co-op missions, fleshing out the story as disgraced Lieutenant Titus races to stop the forces of chaos from destroying mankind.Metascore: 83 | Read our Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 review See at Amazon Call of Duty: Black Ops 6One of the best Call of Duty games in recent memory--and included with Game Pass for the first time--Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 shows why Treyarch has earned players' confidence. The mystery-filled campaign occasionally morphs into all-out horror and succeeds in its open-ended missions in a way Modern Warfare 3 failed. Multiplayer is extremely fast and fluid thanks to the new movement system, and it's impossible to hate Nuketown, even after all these years.Metascore: 83 | Read our Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 campaign and multiplayer reviews See at Amazon Paper Trail2024 might just go down as one of the best years ever for the puzzle genre of games, thanks to titles like Paper Trail. An origami-'em-up about leaving home, Paper Trail has layers upon layers of clever design waiting to be discovered, and its core gameplay loop of merging two sides to solve puzzles gives it a unique appeal. It's a devilishly challenging but rewarding game, one where every answer can be found by folding, spinning, and twisting the world around you.Metascore: 82 Planet Coaster 2The original Planet Coaster is one of a handful of games that felt like it didn't need a sequel thanks to its rock-solid design. Fortunately, Planet Coaster 2 justifies its existence by taking everything that made the first game so popular, polishing them up, and exploring new theme-park attractions, creating a deeper experience overall. While several nagging issues from its predecessor remain, it's still an impressively flexible and highly customizable dive into a world full of ups, downs, and loop-de-loops.Metascore: 82 IndikaOne of the most distinct games of the year, Indika is weird and consistently surprising. It might look like an arthouse film at first glance, but Indika quickly throws players into bizarre situations as they embark on a journey of self-discovery with the devil by their side. A surreal clash of religion and reason, Indika is bleak, strange, and captivating.Metascore: 82 | Read our Indika review Hidden Through Time 2: Myths \u0026 MagicBelieve it or not, but one of the highest-rated games of the year on Xbox is a hidden-object adventure. Imagine Where's Wally as you travel through various historical eras, only you're searching for seemingly random items in a beautifully animated and cozy world. It's a simple recipe for success, but with the brand-new Reality Shift feature, Hidden Through Time 2 becomes a multi-layered experience as you explore maps through multiple dimensions.Metascore: 82 Beyond Good and Evil: 20th Anniversary EditionThe definitive modern version of the venerated masterpiece, Beyond Good and Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition lets you reexperience the classic. The pioneering adventure game gets updated to 4K and 60fps with enhanced graphics and audio, an anniversary gallery, and a new speedrun mode. It's the best way to experience the original while we hold out for its long-awaited, often delayed sequel.Metascore: 79 Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons RemakeGame designer Josef Fares has become known in the game industry for his outspoken public appearances and his studio's Game Awards win for It Takes Two. One of his first projects, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, got a remake this year, sporting single-player or co-op as you guide a pair of brothers to save their ailing father.Metascore: 79",
