  "text": "The Dynasty Warriors franchise recently celebrated its 27 year anniversary, and I have to say, Dynasty Warriors: Origins showcases the series like never before, delivering the most intense combat of any game in DW history. Don’t believe me? Time to put my words to the test as I’m here to announce that the Dynasty Warriors: Origins Demo will be released on November 22! In the demo, you will be able to play the Battle of Sishui Gate, the same battle as the Tokyo Game Show demo. However, we have enhanced the experience with additional elements that were not included at the Tokyo Game Show, providing a more substantial and challenging battle. Additionally, there is no time limit this time, so feel free to enjoy it to your heart’s content! Throughout the demo, players will be able to choose from four types of weapons: Sword, Guandao, Pudao, and Wheels; as well as having options to customize arts, gems, and accessories. But don’t take the fight lightly as the franchise’s strongest officer, Lu Bu, definitely makes his presence known on the battlefield Unlike the demo at the Tokyo Game Show, however, you will be able to choose the difficulty level, so whether you’re skilled at action games or not, we encourage you to give it a try. We are so excited to finally be able to provide everyone with the opportunity to experience the unique tactical action of Dynasty Warriors and we hope you enjoy the exhilarating battles against the massive armies we created! Furthermore, we are happy to announce that Dynasty Warriors: Origins and the demo will be PS5 Pro enhanced. Along with the demo release, pre-orders will also begin on November 22. Pre-order the game to receive the bonus collaboration costume ‘Nameless Warrior Garb’ from the dark Three Kingdoms action RPG, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty. Don’t miss the opportunity! For those unfamiliar with Dynasty Warriors: Origins, or for anyone who wants to see the latest and greatest, we’ve created a video titled ‘Gameplay Features’ where the producer introduces the game and shows off some of the game’s fevered fights. The video covers not only the action you can experience in the demo but also the story, exploration, and growth elements that will be available in the full game. Be sure to check it out!! Dynasty Warriors: Origins releases January 17. We are eagerly looking forward to the day you will be able to play the full game, but until then, it’s demo time! Trending Stories",
