My immediate reaction was “I need that now!” Balatro and all the things I said that because I am not new to Balatro, having bought it on Steam back in April.  When I wrote about it back then, one of my concluding remarks was: My only real problem with the game is why the hell isn’t this in the Apple Store so I can play it on my iPad? Seriously, I even tried using SteamLink to get it on the tablet and, while that worked, it was not a solution I was fond of.  SteamLink essentially emulates a Steam Deck, which means you have virtual on screen versions of all the game pad controls that the Steam Deck (and the Switch) use, which I really don’t like all that much.  I am just not a controller gamer. But native on the iPad for $10?  I could not buy it fast enough.  And when I launched it, it met all my expectations for a tablet title.  Updated for a tap and drag touch interface, it works great.  I love it. Why I want Balatro on my iPad is because I like to use the tablet away from my desk, often when sitting on the couch and half watching something on television.  I can set it aside for a bit, pick it up later, carry on, while playing a card game that doesn’t require constant attention. And Baltro works in that mode.  I am very happy with my purchase. I was even rewarded pretty quickly, finally breaking through the 8th ante to “win” a round, something I had not managed on the PC after quite a bit of play. Wait, I won? I wasn’t even sure what to do then.  I went into Endless Mode, which does in fact have an end… at least it does when you lose.  I made it into the 10th ante and ended up facing The Wall as the third blind.  The Wall doesn’t make any goofy changes, it just has an extra large score you need to make to get past it. Facing The Wall I did not get past it… though I got very close. See, not endless if you mess up! That was far enough beyond where I had made it previously that I seriously considered for a second if I even wanted to play again.  The thing with a Rogue-like is that, once you lose, then you start back at square one, fresh and new.  Your carefully collected set of jokers is gone, all the hands you leveled up are back to level 1, all the card upgrades and additions are taken away. You are back to a plain deck of 52 cards and it can feel like your effort has been torn away from you. I did not play again that night.  But the next night I picked up the iPad and played again.  My win had unlocked a new deck and some new options and there are still a wide range of jokers and special cards I have not seen yet.  There is a lot of depth to the game, a lot of challenges to try. And, having updated to iOS 18, I see that Apple is once again trying to do something with the Game Center option, so I could potentially compete with my wife if I get her to play.  Given her favorite game in Las Vegas is video poker and variations thereof, I think that is doable. Finally, having played it for a week on the iPad, I decided to check to see if it ran on my phone as well… and sure enough, it does.  It is a little odd in that it does insist on being in landscape mode.  That suits the game, but my experience with phone users is that it can be tough to get them to go from portrait to landscape.  But once you make the leap it is good.  Small… I might need my reading glasses small… but good. So there is my happy find of the season. Balatro web site Balatro Steam Page Balatro iOS App Store Page Balatro Google Play Page",
