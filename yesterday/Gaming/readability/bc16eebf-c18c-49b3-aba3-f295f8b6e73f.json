  "text": "Kabuto Park collects cute insects for fun and to use in little pushing battles against other cheery bug hunters. Hana’s on summer vacation. While she could be enjoying lazy days in the sunshine, she’d rather spend all of her time looking through tall grass and in wooded areas to see what sorts of bugs are crawling around. Armed with a net, you can help her sneak up on insects that are flitting about and add them to your crack team of push-battle bugs. Just take your time with the meter that moves back and forth. Swing while you’re in the red and you’ll miss. Swing in the blue and you’ll creep closer, making the green catching area bigger. If you’re careful, you’ll have a team in no time. There are many different bugs you can find (of varying rarities) while you wander the fields. They also have different card-based abilities for when you try your hand at the Battle game. This involves two groups of bugs trying to push each other off the side of a stump. You can play cards that knock back the other team, give yourself energy for bugger moves, bolster your defenses, and more. However, there are set times when either team is pushing and when they’re defending/holding, so don’t just ignore that and waste all of your offensive moods at silly times. Like I did. I really need to pay better attention during tutorials. Once I started paying attention to the mechanics, I really started enjoying this light form of “combat”. Kabuto Park somehow makes bugs, which I can’t stand in real life, so cute that I want to gather them all. The sumo-like battle game is fairly involved and features many adorable cards to play with (and you have to play fast if you want to win, so you get drawn into the game’s frantic pace in a hurry). It’s playful, informative, and fast-paced. Plus I don’t have to interact with any real bugs to enjoy it. Kabuto Park is available now on itch.io.
