  "text": "Possibly the best 16\" gaming laptop so far in 2025.Alienware released a new flagship gaming laptop this year - the Area-51 - and it brings to the table a host of upgrades over the m-series laptops including a sleeker redesign, current generation components, and better cooling potential. Ahead of its 4th of July Sale, Dell has dropped the price on an Alienware 16 Area-51 gaming laptop equipped with the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 mobile graphics for only $2,949.99 with free delivery. The RTX 5080 (mobile) has proven to be slightly more powerful than even the previous generation's flagship RTX 4090 (mobile).Alienware 16 Area-51 RTX 5080 Gaming Laptop for $2,949.99Alienware 16 Area-51 Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX RTX 5080 Gaming Laptop (32GB/1TB)The Area-51: New Style, More Power, Better CoolingNew for 2025, the Alienware Area-51 gaming laptop features a magnesium alloy chassis with upgraded cooling to tackle the latest and greatest heat generating components. This includes more fans and bigger cutouts enabling greater airflow, more generous use of copper, and a new thermal interface material to better transfer heat away from the core components. Dell claims that the laptop can handle a higher power ceiling of up to 240W TDP without raising acoustics.Design-wise, the Area 51 accentuates its smooth contours, with rounded edges and soft corners replacing the squared off design you'd see in most other laptops. The hinges are also mostly internally positioned so that they're near invisible. As befits an Alienware laptop, there are ample customization options for RGB LED lighting.The Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX is a top performing CPUThe Area-51 laptop is also equipped with a very powerful CPU as well. The Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX boasts a max turbo frequency of 5.4GHz with a whopping 24 cores and 40MB total L2 cache. According to Passmark, this is the second most powerful Intel mobile CPU available right now and goes head to head with AMD's Ryzen 9 7945HX3D.The GeForce RTX 5080 Is More Powerful Than the RTX 4090According to Tom's Hardware, the RTX 5080 mobile GPU is roughly 15%-20% more powerful than the RTX 4080 mobile GPU that it replaces. It also happens to be about 5% more powerful than the RTX 4090, which was the previous generation's flagship card. The RTX 5080 appears to be a better value than the much pricier RTX 5090 as well. It only lags by about 15% despite being nearly $1,000 cheaper. This GPU should be able to run new and upcoming games at high framerates even on the display's 2560x1600 native resolution.Check out more of the best Alienware dealsCheck out our Best Alienware Deals article with all of Dell's currently ongoing deals on gaming laptops and desktop PCs.
