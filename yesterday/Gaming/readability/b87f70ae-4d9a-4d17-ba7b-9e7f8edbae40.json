InZoi, Krafton's life simulator that could serve as the first real competition for The Sims, is finally arriving in early access on March 27, but the party is starting a little bit early with the launch of inZoi Creative Studio, which allows players to try out the game's character creation and build mode tools in-depth before jumping into this new simulated world.While many aspects of inZoi will be very familiar to fans of The Sims, particularly as they design their characters, or \"Zois.\" But inZoi goes much further than The Sims in terms of how much you can customize your belongings, and it can be relatively easy to miss some of those options when you're trying the game out for the first time.There are two specific features we're going to highlight here: that you can craft your own clothing and furniture, and that you can apply your own custom textures and patterns to nearly anything. Essentially, these are mod tools built directly into the game's interface, with inZoi natively providing the means to create your own custom content.How to make custom clothing in inZoiIn the character studio, at the bottom of the screen, is a list of things you can customize--your Zoi's face, body, clothes, and accessories. And to the right of those options is another button that says \"Craft,\" which is where you can make new clothes or accessories of your own.InZoi's clothing crafting screenHow it works is that the game provides a number of modular options. On a shirt, for example, you can choose the sleeve type, neck type, whether the shirt tucks in, how baggy it is, and so on. You can also customize the color in the craft menu, but that option is also available when you're picking your clothes later so it's not necessary to worry about that here. Currently, you can create custom shirts, pants, skirts, necklaces and watches.Once you have the item looking like you want it to look, be sure to hit the small blue Save button near the bottom of the screen--if you leave this screen without clicking that button, you'll lose the item and have to make it again.Once you've saved it, you can find your new custom clothes in the new \"Custom\" section of the character studio. This means your newly designed pants will be listed under \"Custom\" rather than in the pants section. And when you equip these pants, you can apply whatever color or custom texture you want then and there.This is another notably deep customization option that inZoi includes: the ability to upload your own textures for nearly every item, or use an AI prompt to generate one. There are some major limitations on this feature right now, though. For one, any image you upload will appear as a pattern, and there's no option to change that.But this provides a method for manually adding, say, polka dots or stripes to your shirts, but you'll need to create them in an external photo editor, which is more work than you'd probably want to do, but also a lot less than making an actual mod.A polka dotted shirt made using inZoi's custom texture toolsHow to make custom furniture in inZoiMaking your own furniture is a bit simpler than making clothes, but that's just because there are fewer permutations available. With a chair, for example, you just mix and match the seat and the legs--so you can take a slick gamer chair and put the wooden legs of a dining chair on it, if you're so inclined. You can even design your own gaming PC like this, picking from several options for monitor, tower, and mouse/keyboard set.You can design your own furniture in inZoi's build mode.Once you've made your item, you'll have all the same options for changing the color or adding custom textures that you had with clothes, but the option is a little bit hidden. You'll need to actually place the item in the world, and then click on it while in build mode in order to customize its color and texture.What does inZoi's 3D printer do?There's another option that you'll encounter in the custom furniture menu: the 3D printer, which claims to allow you to \"create your own custom items\" by uploading a picture of something. This feature is rather limited, because you cannot make functional objects this way--you can feed it a picture of a chair, but your Zois will not be able to sit on the item that results from this process. This means that the 3D printer is strictly for decorations only, and it works best with symmetrical objects, like a vase, or objects where you only ever see one side of it, like a wall plaque.
