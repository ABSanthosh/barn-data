This will introduce a variety of updates to the Overworld that will make biomes \"feel more immersive and alive,\" such as new variants for cows, pigs, and chickens, and new ambient features and sounds (glittering firefly bush, falling leaves, and whispers of sand). Spring to Life launches on March 25.The second game drop of the year doesn't have a name just yet, but we do know what it will include. There's a new block called the Dried Ghast that can be rehydrated to form a new mob variant called a Ghastling (baby ghast, essentially), which in turn can become the new Happy Ghast mob variant. The Ghast harness is used to fly the Happy Ghast, which can carry up to four players.Today's big update was a major visual upgrade for Minecraft called 'Vibrant Visuals,' \"the first step in expressing our developers’ vision for a visual upgrade that will transform the way our players experience Minecraft,\" Mojang said. Vibrant Visuals does not impact Minecraft gameplay in any way.Check out IGN's separate article on the Vibrant Visuals upgrade to find out more, and IGN's visuals comparison video below.Meanwhile, Mojang shared a new clip for the upcoming A Minecraft Movie and announced a movie-themed in-game live event that kicks off on March 25.We've got plenty more from Mojang based on our trip to its offices in Sweden, including why the developer won't make a Minecraft 2, won't make Minecraft free-to-play, and won't use generative AI to develop the game.Minecraft Live 2025 — everything announced:Mojang Studios announced the name, launch date, and features of the first game drop of the year, as well as upcoming features in the second game drop of the year.The first game drop of the year is called “Spring to Life,” and introduces a variety of updates to the Overworld that will make biomes feel more immersive and alive.Spring to Life adds warm and cold variants of some of Minecraft's classic mobs, new ambient features like the glittering firefly bush, falling leaves, and whispers of sand, and more reasons to explore The second game drop of the year includes the new Dried Ghast block, the new Ghastling and Happy Ghast mob variants, and the Ghast harness.The Dried Ghast is a little big smaller than a regular block and has cute little tentacles and a grumpy face.If you pick up the Dried Ghast from the Nether and put it in water, eventually it will become a much happier Ghastling.The Ghastling floats around the Overworld like a little balloon. Feed it snowballs and eventually it will grow up to become a flying Happy Ghast.If you craft a harness for the Happy Ghast, tempt it to come closer with the harness itself, then jump on it. From there, you and up to three other players can fly around on a single Happy Ghast.The new Locator Bar feature, positioned at the bottom of the screen, lets you see in which direction your friends are. That will be useful for finding friends while flying a Happy Ghast.Mojang said the Happy Ghast will be useful for Survival Mode builders, because \"it's a bit like being in Creative Mode, but in Survival.\" The platform lets you position wherever you like in the sky and dismount.Mojang Studios announced a visual upgrade for Minecraft, titled Vibrant Visuals.Mojang revealed an exclusive A Minecraft Movie clip and announced an in-game movie-themed live event.The live event takes place in Midport Village, and sees players join Steve and his companions from the movie in an evolving multiplayer experience where you defend the village from a piglin attack in three mini games.The live event runs from March 25 to April 7, and if you complete all the challenges you earn the Yearn cape.Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
