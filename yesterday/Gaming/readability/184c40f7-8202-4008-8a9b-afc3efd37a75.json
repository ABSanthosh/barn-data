  "text": "\"When I signed on to do the series, they gave me the endpoint.\" Image credit: Amazon Amazon's hit Fallout show will run for five or six seasons. That's according to actor Aaron Moten, who revealed in an interview at Comic Con Liverpool that when he signed on for the role of Maximus, he was told to expect the show to run for \"five, six\" seasons in total. How To Build Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus in Fallout 4 How To Build Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus in Fallout 4.Watch on YouTube \"When I signed on to do the series, we would have a starting point, and they gave me the end point,\" Moten explained (thanks, TheGamer). \"That endpoint hasn't changed, but it is season five, season six, type of endpoint. We've always known that we're going to take our time with the development of the characters.\" Given Fallout's rich lore across several games, this may not be a complete surprise, but it's good news nonetheless, as it assures Fallout fans that the show was created with longevity in mind. Fallout TV series is planned by showrunners for 5 or 6 seasons said actor Aaron Moten byu/TOZAR_N7 inFotv\"Excellent sign!\" said one happy fan. \"Too many stories fall apart suddenly when the writers don't have a solid plan.\" Production on Fallout season two wrapped this week, and actor Walton Goggins shared the news by ripping off his prosthetics. Fallout's first season was a huge hit for Amazon, and was quickly picked up for a second season. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy - who executive produce the show via Kilter Films - said they couldn't \"wait to blow up the world all over again\", although production shut down during the filming of Fallout season 2 following the devastating wildfires. There have been several set leaks, giving us a closer look at some iconic locales and faces from the Fallout video games, and Goggins has assured fans it will blow the first season out of the water. New cast members reported to be joining Goggins and co. include Kumail Nanjiani as \"a high-ranking official within the Brotherhood of Steel\" and Macaulay Culkin as \"a crazy genius-type character\".",
