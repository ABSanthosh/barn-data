He has written for the likes of Grammy.com/The Recording Academy, Fandom Gaming, Gamespew, CBR, The Verge, Billboard, JD Sports, XDA, VIBE Magazine, HotNewHipHop, Consequence of Sound, The Face, and more.Electronic Arts has canceled its Black Panther game and closed down developer Cliffhanger Games. IGN, which first reported the news, cites an internal email in which EA Entertainment president Laura Miele notified staff about the changes made to “sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities.”“These decisions are hard,” Miele wrote, per IGN. “They affect people we’ve worked with, learned from, and shared real moments with. We’re doing everything we can to support them — including finding opportunities within EA, where we’ve had success helping people land in new roles.”The email continues, detailing that EA will now shift resources to the historically successful Battlefield, The Sims, Skate, and Apex Legends series. Miele also said that a game based on Iron Man is still in the works, as is the third entry in Respawn’s Star Wars Jedi series and BioWare’s next entry in Mass Effect.EA previously laid off around 300 employees across both Respawn Entertainment and Electronic Art’s Fan Care teams in April 2025. Variety reported at the time that EA had effectively canceled the next Titanfall game and another unnamed game in “early-stage incubation.”Polygon has contacted EA for comment and will update this story with any further information we receive.Black Panther was first announced by Marvel Games, EA, and Cliffhanger Games in 2023. The game was part of a three-game deal that Marvel Games reached with EA that also includes an Iron Man game developed by Motive. EA established the Seattle-based Cliffhanger Games in 2023 to work on the Black Panther game, which coincided with the 57th anniversary of the hero. The studio, led by former Monolith executive Kevin Stephens, was staffed by developers known for working on series like Halo, God of War, and Call of Duty.According to a Marvel press release, the Black Panther game was set to be “an original, third-person, single-player Black Panther game...that empowers players to experience what it is like to take on the mantle of Wakanda’s protector, the Black Panther.”",
