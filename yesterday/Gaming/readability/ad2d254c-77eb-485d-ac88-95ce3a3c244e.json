Earlier in March, AMD released its highest end model in its latest Zen 5 \"X3D\" stack: the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D. Although this processor has been out of stock at most retailers since its launch, Amazon has finally listed it back in stock starting today with no markup, although I don't know for how long. This is currently the best gaming chip across both Intel and AMD that it serves as a better option for creators than the previous chart-topper, the 9800X3D.The Creator's Choice: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D CPUMostly out of stock since launch back in MarchAMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D AM5 Desktop ProcessorCreative professionals who also want the best gaming chip on the market shouldn't think twice; this is the CPU to get. The new 9950X3D boasts a max boost clock of 5.7GHz with 16 cores, 32 threads, and 144MB of L2-L3 cache. In terms of gaming, it's only a few percentage points better than than the 9800X3D. However, for productivity use, it easily outperforms the other two Zen 5 X3D chips, and anything offered by Intel for that matter.The Gamer's Choice: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPUAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D AM5 Desktop ProcessorAMD's X3D series processors are gaming optimized thanks to AMD's 3D V-Cache technology. However, since all three CPUs have the 3D V-cache loaded onto a single CCD, you get roughly the same gaming performance across all three chips. The minor differences are mostly due to the difference in clock speed. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D boasts a max boost clock of 5.2GHz with 8 cores, 16 threads, and 104MB of L2-L3 cache Although perfectly capable of handling multitasking, rendering, and creation, the limited number of cores means they aren't the ideal processors for those tasks. However, this is an absolute monster of a processor for gaming, especially at this price point.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
