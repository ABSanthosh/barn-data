It includes the first three films in 4K and digital, and is now on sale for $29 (was $45). If you want a collectible box set, Walmart's exclusive John Wick: Chapters 1-3 Stash Collection Steelbook is available for $50. You can round out the series by snagging John Wick: Chapter 4 on 4K Blu-ray for $15.49 (was $23).It’s not offered in 4K, but the standard John Wick: Chapter 1-4 Collection contains standard Blu-ray and digital versions of all four films and is just $30.
