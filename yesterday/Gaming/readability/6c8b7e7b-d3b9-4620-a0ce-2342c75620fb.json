  "text": "Image credit: LEVEL5 Inc Early access for Fantasy Life i on Xbox Series X/S version has been delayed. After dropping an unexpected head's up about a possible delay earlier today, developer Level-5 has now confirmed that today's early launch on Xbox Series X/S will not go ahead as planned due to an \"ongoing technical issue on Xbox's end\". FANTASY LIFE i: The Girl Who Steals Time - All Features at a Glance! FANTASY LIFE i: The Girl Who Steals Time - All Features at a Glance!Watch on YouTube \"Early Access for the Xbox Series X|S version of Fantasy Life i, originally scheduled to begin at 3:00 PM GMT on May 18, has unfortunately been delayed due to an ongoing technical issue on Xbox's side,\" the developer said on social media. \"As of now, the issue remains unresolved and players are still unable to play on Xbox platforms. \"We truly want players to dive into [Fantasy Life i] as soon as possible and it's incredibly frustrating for us that we cannot yet make that happen,\" the statement added. \"We are continuing to work closely with the relevant teams to restore access as soon as possible, but are currently unable to provide a specific time for when Early Access will begin. We will share updates on this account and our official website as soon as we have more information.\" Update: Xbox Early Access Launch Delayed Early Access for the Xbox Series X|S version of FANTASY LIFE i, originally scheduled to begin at 3:00 PM GMT on May 18, has unfortunately been delayed due to an ongoing technical issue on Xbox's side.As of now, the issue remains…— FANTASY LIFE Series (@FANTASYLIFE_EN) May 18, 2025 The team said it would be \"reviewing possible measures to compensate for the delay\" and will \"share more\" once details are confirmed. The statement closed on confirming the issue does not affect early access on Steam or PS4/5. Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time will launch for all players across PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S (hopefully), Switch, and PC via Steam on 21st May. We first got word of Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time during a Nintendo Direct in February 2023. At the time of its announcement, the game was set to release in 2023, but it later saw its launch nudged back. Away from Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time, Level-5 also has a new Professor Layton game in the pipeline. It's known as New World of Steam and will place the Professor as something of a newcomer himself, in a story which moves the series' action to America.",
