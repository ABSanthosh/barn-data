  "text": "And there'll be \"infinite\" maps apparently Image credit: 1047 Games You know, I don't think I'll ever understand why, after finding a huge amount of surprise success, developer 1047 Games decided to stop working on Splitgate all so that they could make a sequel. Perhaps that's just part of my general confusion towards live service games as a whole, but I do think it's a bit odd all the same. Still, Splitgate 2 is still on track for a 2025 release it seems, with a date now set for the game's first open beta. As confirmed in a very brief teaser trailer released earlier today, the FPS will be getting an open beta next month, May 22nd. In terms of content, there will apparently be 25 plus weapons, including the \"brand new Borealis, an energy carbine power weapon\", 10 plus modes like Takedown, a mode returning from the first game where \"teams battle to eliminate all members of the opposing team before they can respawn\", and 15 plus maps, including a couple of 24-player Onslaught maps. Open Beta Teaser Trailer | Splitgate 2 Watch on YouTube Actually, hang on, scratch that, as both the trailer and a press release notes that there'll be \"infinite\" maps. The trailer didn't elaborate on that, and the press release said that 1047 \"promise to reveal exactly what that means soon.\" Judging from the trailer itself, and the fact this was a feature in the first game, it'll be a map editor. On the other hand, that would still mean a finite amount of maps, as just because there would theoretically be a regular supply of them, you could still put an exact number as to how many there are. Perhaps there's some kind of randomly generated map feature instead, I don't know, I realise I'm being very particular about this, I just don't appreciate hyperbole. No details on how to sign-up just yet either, so you'll just have to keep your eyes peeled.",
