  "text": "Image credit: Shift Up Both Dune: Awakening and Stellar Blade have set new concurrent user records on Steam over the weekend. Dune: Awakening, which released 10th June for all, and Stellar Blade, which had its long-anticipated PC debut on 11th, both launched with comparatively few problems, and their success has been underlined by the number of players getting stuck in over the weekend. At the time of writing, Dune: Awakening has secured an all-time concurrent peak of 175.5K players, and Stellar Blade 192K. Stellar Blade - PC Features Trailer | PC Games Stellar Blade PC features trailer.Watch on YouTube That puts both games in the top ten of most-played games of the weekend, with just Counter-Strike 2, PUBG, Dota 2, and Apex Legends attracting more players. The PlayStation-published Stellar Blade made its way onto PC earlier this week and within hours of release, it was already the most successful PlayStation-published single-player game on the platform by concurrent count. Image credit: SteamDB / Eurogamer In comparison, Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered has a peak player count of 66,436, Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition has a peak of 56,557, The Last of Us Part 1 has a peak of 36,496 and its sequel - The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered - has a peak of 30,690. Only Helldivers 2 has attracted more players at once, but that's, of course, a multiplayer title. Dune Awakening soared past 142,000 concurrent players on Steam following its full public release, quickly surpassing the peak established during the five-day head start for those who bought the Deluxe or Ultimate edition. Within hours of the full launch, it blew past 113,000 players and currently has a concurrent record of 175K. Not sure if either game is for you? In Eurogamer's original Stellar Blade review, we noted it \"has a fair bit of weirdness\", but \" its killer tunes and vibey, flow-state combat - plus a transformative hard mode - are enough to leave you entranced\". Meanwhile, Connor's having a great time with Dune: Awakening thus far, writing in our review-in-progress: \"It's too early for a full review, but as of right now, I see little reason not to recommend giving Dune Awakening's unique offering a chance.\"",
