  "text": "Nom Nom: Cozy Forest Café uses rhythm and culinary creativity to put together a photogenic hangout for animals. There are some cafes that are just set up to be in someone’s Instagram timeline. That’s just the way they are! In this game, you are creating a lovely little cafe for the creatures of the forest – one full of cute drinks and treats, decorations, and the ability to take your own photographs. Nom Nom: Cozy Forest Café isn’t a management game with all the stress of managing resources and trying to beat the clock. All of the animals that visit your shop are pretty chill; they’re just looking to get a little pastry and sit down in the quiet corner where you’ve created your shop. You can actually make the treats through a rhythm game that has you tapping when the paw prints hit the middle of the screen. It’s a nice break from your shop and very easy to master. When you’ve made your dessert or drink, you do get to customise and design some of the wrapper and other aspects of it, which is quite fun! I decorated the outside of my boba to ensure the sleeve was cute. I could then, in the photograph, change the background of the picture and add little details to make the photo adorable. This sort of customisation is all throughout Nom Nom: Cozy Forest Café. You can change the color of the furniture, alter the walls, and otherwise create your own place. Lots of cute creatures come in, all of which are animals with their own favorite dishes and decorations that make them happy. Over time, you can unlock more recipes, styles for your cafe, and more customers that you can then interact with. I found Nom Nom: Cozy Forest Café to be a delightful experience when I played the demo at Indie Dev Day. It’s a game that I will be watching closely as I do want to play it on release! Nom Nom: Cozy Forest Café is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can add it to your Steam Wishlist.
