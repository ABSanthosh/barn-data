  "text": "Image credit: Eurogamer/Sony It's a big day for The Last of Us. Not only does Part 2 Remastered make its debut on PC, all platforms receive a sizeable 2.0 update, adding new No Return maps and more. Unfortunately, where the 2.0 update giveth, it's seemingly also taking away, with players reporting their character upgrades have been wiped - suggesting you might want to download with caution. Naughty Dog celebrated 2.0's arrival earlier today on social media, but players quickly moved in to report the skill tree upgrades and gun holsters they'd previously acquired for Ellie and Abby during their campaign play-throughs had now vanished into the ether, with seemingly no way to restore them. It's a similar story over on the Last of Us subreddit, where multiple posters have - with barely concealed wails of anguish - reported upgrade disappearances across in-progress first play-throughs, new game plus runs, and permadeath mode. Naughty Dog, for its part, is yet to acknowledge the reports on any of its official channels, but it seems like it would be wise to avoid downloading the update or firing up the game until there's clarity on how widespread the issue is and whether a fix is possible/incoming. The Last of Us Part 2 PC Review - We're Disappointed - Analysis + Optimised Settings Digital Foundry takes a look at The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered on PC.Watch on YouTube The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered's 2.0 update for PS5 and PC was announced at the end of March, promising a range of new additions to the game's roguelike No Return mode, including two new characters - The Last of Us Part 1's Bill and Marlene (sporting the Smuggler and Risk-Taker playstyles respectively) - four new maps, and new Trophies. As for Part 2 Remastered's PC port, it seems to have been generally well-received by players, with the Steam release currently enjoying a Very Positive rating. That's in sharp contrast to the somewhat disastrous PC release of The Last of Us Part 1 in 2023, which was rapidly slapped with a Mostly Negative rating as players flocked to highlight a host of technical issues - resulting in a string of patches as Naughty Dog admitted it hadn't deliver \"the quality [players] expected\". Digital Foundry has also cast its expert eye over The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered's new PC release, calling it a \"better\" port compared to its predecessor, despite \"some frustrating elements and a buggy feeling that's hard to shake\". Away from the game, the promotional chatter around season two of HBO's live-action The Last of Us adaptation has reached fever pitch as its 13th April start date nears. Most recently, Kaitlyn Dever - who's playing Abby in the show - discussed how she was determined to \"do this character justice and make the fans proud\".",
