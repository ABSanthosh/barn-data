Skype 2012-2017 Logo That time, however, was a while back.  I think, at the end, the product was hanging on the way that AOL hangs on, out of habit for some users… my mother-in-law still pays a monthly subscription for AOL account and does all he email through it… than as any sort of viable business venture. Microsoft, which bought the product back in 2011 tried to make it a big thing, with offshoots like Skype for Business, integrating the app into its impenetrable technological web.  My most recent interaction with Skype was trying to cancel my mom’s paid account when consolidating her finances when she had to move into assisted living.  That wasn’t the most difficult of the myriad subscriptions my mother had signed up for, but neither did Microsoft make it easy to cancel either.  I think they knew three years back that, as a stand alone subscription, its days were numbered. There is a whole history of Skype ownership, which started with some European devs who stood up the app in 2003 under the name Skyper, for “sky peer to peer,” but then could only get the domain name “skype” so dropped the last letter.  The quirks of fate that name things. They sold it, to eBay of all people, in 2005 for $2.6 billion.  Then, in 2009 eBay got some investors to buy in on it.  Finally, Microsoft paid $8.5 billion for the app in 2011, looking to have it replace their Windows Live service… and you can say any number of negative things about Skype, but it was sure as hell a step up from Windows Live. Then Microsoft did what it always does, tried to assimilated it into whatever the Borg vision of the month was, enshittifying it into a strange parody of itself… not that it hadn’t been abused before Microsoft.  Redmond’s command just finished the job, so that saying that you used Skype in 2025 was kind of like having an email address at hotmail.com… or aol.com, for that matter… in 2025. But there was a time when Skype was a thing. I am pretty sure that, for the first five or so years of the instance group in WoW, we used Skype.  You could, with your free account, set up a five way conference call, which was exactly what our group needed to start off into the Deadmines back in 2006.  That was a pretty big deal in an era when you otherwise might need to rent and maintain a TeamSpeak server to speak while in-game. Since then it feels like nearly everybody added… and in some cases subsequently removed… in game voice.  And, of course, Discord rolled up on us and because something of a standard, such that I don’t think much about voice over IP apps anymore.  But there was a time when they were all the rage and it was imaged by many a visionary that there would be a host of free range soft phones and even stand alone VoIP hardware phones roaming the land, able to connect to whatever you wanted.  Crazy times.  I wrote more about that era here. The black version of the physical PingTel VoIP phone… it came in various colors I even had a paid Skype account for a while, back in the early 2000s.  When I was working with teams across the country and around the world Skype offered a flat fee long distance dialing plan at a time when our home phone and cell phones were still charging per minute for calls and extra for long distance and what not.  It was easier for me to be at home with a headset hooked up to my computer and dialed into a conference call early in the morning or late in the evening. I still had to go into the office every day, but with a laptop and Skype I didn’t need to be sitting in my cube or office at 5am because the bozos in Cincinnati scheduled a call at 8am local time the day after I was on Skype with the team in Gurgaon until midnight.  It was also easy and cheaper… and occasionally more reliable… to call my mom in Hawaii on Skype. That was probably the peak time for Skype.  I remember it would convert phone numbers on web pages to buttons you could click to initiate a call from the app.  Not a technically difficult achievement, but I somehow doubt Google or Mozilla would allow that in their browsers now.  I mean, Microsoft would in Edge, sure… and probably Google if they could sell the data about which numbers you clicked. Whatever was left of Skype is now part of Microsoft Teams, an app I must use every day at work because the state is 100% bought in on the Microsoft ecosystem.  I think they recently drive Salesforce out of some departments and are no doubt lining up against SAP.  It is a very Microsoft app, which means there are about 19 ways to do something and they change at least once a year.  It is a pain in my ass. I mentioned the final shut down of Skype at our team’s morning standup this week and a couple of the team had some memories of the app… memories of youth, since most of my team is about half my age. But one of the devs mentions that he had seen, just the other day, that Skype was in the name of some of the Azure includes.  That probably won’t change for a long time.  Anybody who has worked on enterprise software for a stretch knows that every name a product has gets immortalized in the code and stays there even when marketing makes you change the name on the splash screen.  You dare not change the names in the code because you never know what will break.  Safer just to leave things exactly as they are if they’re working.  Going through the code of a long lived enterprise software resource can be like an archeological dig. Skype is gone in name, but lives on in code libraries for now.",
