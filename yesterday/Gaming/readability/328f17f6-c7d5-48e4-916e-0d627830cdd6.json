  "text": "Hey everyone, Thierry here speaking for Sabotage. Our friends at PlayStation extended an invitation to share more about everything that has happened since the launch of Sea of Stars, and how that led our team to work full-time for the better part of a year on a major free update called Dawn of Equinox. So let’s dive into a summary of what’s included, namely general updates, combat 2.0, and couch co-op. Updates Along with countless bug fixes and micro adjustments, we added a bonus pre-rendered cinematic cutscene and finally got to revamp the game’s first hour by adding combat animations for the kid versions of our heroes. This allowed us to ditch the flashback structure by having action directly in the intro, something we sadly had to give up on during production. We also added difficulty presets, a bunch of new Relics to customize the experience, and even a comprehensive Speedrun Mode designed with the help of our community. There’s some new music, character portraits, and animations—the list goes on. The update brings two key changes to the combat system: Sticky Combo Points and Mystery Locks. Along with a comprehensive balancing pass, of course. Sticky Combo Points: The gist of it here is that Combo Points now remain after battle, giving combo moves a lot more use overall, whether to open more aggressively on a regular fight, or providing more options to deal damage of the different types when dealing with locks. This one mainly addresses the feeling of there not being a enough variety of moves in the game. The vision was always to give each character a small kit (MOBA-style), where each move has situational utility, rather than a big list where players pigeonhole themselves into only using their couple of favorites. All good intentions, but while the game boasts over 40 unique and custom-animated moves total, the scarcity of Combo Points meant players seldom engaged with most of them, reducing the perceived scope of combat to feeling like only having three skills per character. Mystery Locks: This is another one that should always have been there. In short, Mystery Locks bring a new gameplay loop around revealing how to break enemies’ spells whenever they are first encountered. Instead of displaying the damage types required for each lock, they are hidden, requiring the player to try different attacks to see what will break each lock. Note that this is on a per enemy type, per spell basis, meaning that progression toward revealing Mystery Locks is saved in real-time. The main effect on the experience here is that there will be more enemy spells flying overall, bringing a small uptick in difficulty by relying on the occurrence of more gnarly enemy moves rather than relying solely on the intricate balance between damage done and damage received. This change also adds a “Reveal” function to some of the character skills and combos, adding more layers of strategy based on whether it’s time to map a new enemy’s spells, or to go all out with damage. Combined with Sticky Combo Points and difficulty presets, Mystery Locks gives us the definitive edition of the combat system for Sea of Stars. Couch co-op (or online using Share Play) We knew this one would be  challenging given the hundreds of cutscenes, interactive objects, camera work, puzzles, menus, NPC interactions, and countless other things that would simply break in thousands of ways if more than one player had full control over the game’s world. But the co-op dream was very much alive within the team, so we went for it, manually implementing every single edgecase one at a time until we had a full-on three-player mode. You can even use PS5’s Share Play feature to play online co-op with a friend (PlayStation Plus required, here’s how to use it). In combat: Combat initiates when any player touches an enemy or projectile. In this mode, it doesn’t matter who controls which character in the overworld; players take turns at random picking the next action from the character of their choice. Whenever an action occurs, all players can chime in to perform Team Blocks and Team Hits for even more bonus effects. For example, whenever all three players time a block properly, the damage is always zero. Out in the world: We aimed for maximum freedom outside combat. All three players can run, swim, climb, shop, change equipment, talk to NPCs, trigger cutscenes, initiate combat, etc. Anything that a solo player could do, we wanted to make available for all. There’s even 1v1 Wheels now. Along with a friendly bubble to bring any stray players back into the adventure, a high-five mechanic brings a fun little way to interact with one another while gaining a short speed boost in the process. Oh, we also made the animation sets required for fishing to be available for all characters. Looking ahead With the Dawn of Equinox update in the rear view, the team is now focused on the upcoming free DLC Throes of the Watchmaker, which is on track to be released in the Spring of 2025. We hope you enjoyed this behind-the-scenes look into what’s been going on at Sabotage over the past year. Thank you all once again for the overwhelming support. Whether you’ll be playing for the first time or going for another run, we hope you will enjoy Sea of Stars in its full expression. Sea of Stars: Dawn of Equinox content update is now available on PS4 and PS5. Safe travels! Trending Stories",
