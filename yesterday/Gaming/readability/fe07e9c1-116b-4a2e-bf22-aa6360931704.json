  "text": "The birdman returns in the next-gen remake of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4, coming to PS5 and PS4 on July 11. The legendary skateboarding series first launched on the original PlayStation in 1999, and the shred’s not dead. It’s back and better than ever. Skate the original content rebuilt from the ground up joined by new skaters, parks, tricks, music, and more, including enhanced creation tools and New Game+ to keep the grind going. Here’s what’s coming down the halfpipe: Prepare to shred Skate through two challenge-filled tours in Career, chase high scores in Single Sessions and Speedruns, or take your time nailing tricks and exploring each park in Free Skate. Bring your skate friends along, too. Cross-platform online multiplayer supports up to eight skaters at a time. Go head-to-head in competitive game modes or skate every surface together in multiplayer Free Skate. Whichever mode you play, the game’s smooth handling and simple-to-learn controls will have you grinding and landing tricks in no time. Classic and new parks, New Game+ Skate the original parks from THPS3 and THPS4 remade in 4K resolution and given streamlined goals in the two-minute format along with some new parks to expand your skating options. Tackle dozens of challenges to earn in-game cash and unlock new gear including new skate decks, grip tapes, wheels for your board, and extra apparel for your skater. Shred harder than ever in New Game+, retaining your skater’s stat growth achieved in the first playthrough as you work toward true mastery over each of the parks. Waterpark In the new Waterpark map, skaters drop into the Mojave Desert in an abandoned theme park that’s seen better days, its slides rusted, graffiti on the walls, and a drained-out lazy river… creating the perfect skate obstacle for circling the park. Skip the line and head straight to the top of several huge water slides, testing your grind balance and vert abilities on the way down.  New skaters, tricks, songs Hit up the park with new skaters joining the original lineup or create your own skater with in-depth customization options for hair, tattoos, makeup, and more. Pick your skater’s name, hometown, skating style, and get out there with your arsenal of new and classic tricks. If you’re feeling rusty, the in-game tutorial led by Tony Hawk will get you started with lessons on the all-important ollie, kickflips, vert tricks, grinds, reverts, manuals, special tricks, and everything you need to become a high-score skater, all set to songs from the original soundtrack expanded with new music. Skate the Foundry Demo Preorder THPS 3 + 4 to skate in the Foundry Demo in June featuring two playable skaters, two parks, and a selection of songs from the soundtrack. Players who preorder the game also gain instant access to the in-game Wireframe Tony Shader at launch. Digital Deluxe Edition: Early Access and more Purchase the Digital Deluxe Edition to join the Early Access period starting three days before the game’s official July 11 launch date. Plus, get access to some sick in-game extras: Extra skaters: Get evil with Doom Slayer and Revenant. Both skaters include a pair of unique special tricks for some truly sick moves suited to their demonic style. Extra tracks: Expand the in-game soundtrack with a selection of headbanging tunes inspired by a classic video game. Extra skate decks, apparel: Get additional skate decks including designs inspired by Doom Slayer and Revenant, plus extra apparel options for your skater.   Collector’s Edition: limited-edition skate deck The Collector’s Edition is for the most dedicated skaters including a limited-edition full-size Birdhouse skateboard deck with a reissued version of the Wings graphic and a printed Tony Hawk autograph. The Collector’s Edition includes a physical copy of the game with a voucher giving access to all the Digital Deluxe Edition benefits. Get shredding Preorders are now available for Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4, which launches on PS5 and PS4 on July 11. Stay tuned for more information to come. Trending Stories",
