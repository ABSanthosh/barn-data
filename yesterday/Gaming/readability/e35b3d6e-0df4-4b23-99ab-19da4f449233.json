  "text": "The invasion of Insmother, such that it was, is over.  The Imperium has lurched east to put itself on the boarder of its primary rival, PanFam, with Asher talking about perpetual war being a thing now that we do not have any third parties in the way.  We gave up some space while acquiring more, and are now settling down and setting up shop in new home stations.  As such, it seems like a good moment to see who ended up where. For that, a quick “before and after” illustration seems like a good start, so I will once again swipe some images from the Null Sec Player Influence maps archive, starting with the state of southern null sec on June 1, 2025. Southern Null Sec – June 1, 2025 You may need to click on that map to see it full size to be able to read some of the smaller names. That shows Goonswarm Federation, the largest alliance in the Imperium, holding all of Impass as well as major parts of Catch, Immensea, Tenerifis, and Scalding Pass. Other Imperium alliances were in Delve (Brave and DC), Period Basis (DC), Querious (Brave, IGC, Lawn, Sons of Bane), Paragon Soul (Sigma Grindset), Esoteria and Feythabolis (Fanatic Legion and Shadow Ultimatum), and Tenerifis (Out of the Blue). So the Imperium was already sprawled over 11 regions before the summer shift happened. Then came the move ops, which left the Imperium alliances in some different space.  As of this writing this is the state of sovereignty is (number of systems and destination regions): Brave Collective – (71) Impass, Tenerifis Dracarys (DC) – (119) Esoteria, Paragon Soul, Period Basis Fanatic Legion (55) Cache, Feythabolis, Impass, Tenerifis Get Off My Lawn – (8) Insmother Goonswarm Federation – (473) Cache, Deteroid, Immensea, Impass, Insmother, Scalding Pass, Tenerifis, Wicked Creek Tactical Narcotics Team – (0) Invidia Gloriae Comes (IGC) – (29) Esoteria Out of the Blue – (21) Immensea Scumlords – (1) Scalding Pass SONS of BANE – (7) Insmother Shadow Ultimatum – (64) Feythabolis Sigma Grindset (85) Catch, Paragon Soul, Scalding Pass Those numbers are not final as some transfers and moves are still in progress.  Brave, for example, still has a couple systems in Querious that haven’t been scooped up yet but which are not going to be defended.  I am also not sure when/if/where my old alliance, TNT, is going to pick up some space. South Null – July 15, 2025 But as of this moment that is 933 systems across 13 regions.  That is a lot of systems. Granted, not as many systems as the bad old days of the maximum rental empire era back in 2014 when I divided space up into three domains. Eternal War – 2014 version But it is still a lot of space. This is, in part, due to late year’s Equinox expansion, which ended the era of “farms and fields” and made alliance go “wide” across space rather that “tall” within a smaller area.  But mostly it is grabbing a secure, defensible section of space adjacent to our usual foes so that we can have at them (and them at us) without a lot of travel or wormholes or whatever. The question arises then of what happened with the alliances that lived in some of that space back in late May and early June. The PanFam alliance, primarily Pandemic Horde, Northern Coalition, Mohist Alliance, and Solyaris Chtonium, pulled back further into the Dronelands, the central eastern portion of null sec, without much in the way of fighting.  Only Solyaris Chtonium decided to push back, attacking the sov we took now and then.  Good on them. Then there were the other, unaligned groups like Legion of xXDEATHXx, Only Fleets, Siege Green.  What happened to them? It depends on who you ask.  Gobbins pinged out that mean old Goons had evicted a bunch of small alliances, proving once again that we were the bad guys. Asher and some people from those alliances have pointed out that the Imperium paid them for their space, bought structures from them, put them on the access list for jump bridges to help them move, pointed them at space we were abandoning in Delve and Querious, and even sold them some discount structures in those regions. That is a bit different than what might be implied by “evicted.”  We certainly asked them to leave, but we didn’t burn down their stuff and hunt them until they gave up.  We might have sold somebody a structure in a system and then offered the sov for that system to somebody else, but I am sure that will get worked out. (The streamer Crash Naps seems pretty worked up about that, but streamers often try keep their audience engaged through outrage.  See: Asmongold.) Certainly the Only Fleets alliance isn’t on Reddit complaining about mean old Goons.  They’ve been posting a series of promotional videos about how much ass they have been kicking in their new space. (If you can find them in amongst all the anti-Absolute Order and Waifu War posts.)  Once again, good on them!  Querious fight club lives again! Meanwhile, The Initiative took a chunk of Delve as we left, covering their southern flank between Fountain and Querious, along with a few systems in “fake Querious” that do not connect to the rest of that region.  Also in Delve is Synergy of Steel from the Phoenix Coalition along with a few other small groups from Catch.  It has been a pretty massive migration. In the southeast, only Brotherhood of Spacers and SL0W remain tucked away down in Omist.  I am not sure if they were sufficiently out of the way that the Imperium didn’t want their space or if they just said “no” and we moved along.  Both groups came out of the north with the collapse of the B2 Coalition back in late 2023.  They are not in our coalition, but they are groups we’ve worked with before, so I am not sure what our current status is with them. So that is the way things landed.",

area.  But mostly it is grabbing a secure, defensible section of space adjacent to our usual foes so that we can have at them (and them at us) without a lot of travel or wormholes or whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question arises then of what happened with the alliances that lived in some of that space back in late May and early June.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe PanFam alliance, primarily Pandemic Horde, Northern Coalition, Mohist Alliance, and Solyaris Chtonium, pulled back further into the Dronelands, the central eastern portion of null sec, without much in the way of fighting.  Only Solyaris Chtonium decided to push back, attacking the sov we took now and then.  Good on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there were the other, unaligned groups like Legion of xXDEATHXx, Only Fleets, Siege Green.  What happened to them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt depends on who you ask.  Gobbins pinged out that mean old Goons had evicted a bunch of small alliances, proving once again that we were the bad guys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsher and some people from those alliances have pointed out that the Imperium paid them for their space, bought structures from them, put them on the access list for jump bridges to help them move, pointed them at space we were abandoning in Delve and Querious, and even sold them some discount structures in those regions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is a bit different than what might be implied by “evicted.”  We certainly asked them to leave, but we didn’t burn down their stuff and hunt them until they gave up.  We might have sold somebody a structure in a system and then offered the sov for that system to somebody else, but I am sure that will get worked out. (The streamer Crash Naps seems pretty worked up about that, but streamers often try keep their audience engaged through outrage.  See: Asmongold.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCertainly the \u003ca href=\"https://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/OnlyFleets.\"\u003eOnly Fleets\u003c/a\u003e alliance isn’t on Reddit complaining about mean old Goons.  They’ve been posting a series of promotional videos about how much ass they have been kicking in their new space. (If you can find them in amongst all the anti-Absolute Order and Waifu War posts.)  Once again, good on them!  Querious fight club lives again!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, The Initiative took a chunk of Delve as we left, covering their southern flank between Fountain and Querious, along with a few systems in “fake Querious” that do not connect to the rest of that region.  Also in Delve is Synergy of Steel from the Phoenix Coalition along with a few other small groups from Catch.  It has been a pretty massive migration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the southeast, only Brotherhood of Spacers and SL0W remain tucked away down in Omist.  I am not sure if they were sufficiently out of the way that the Imperium didn’t want their space or if they just said “no” and we moved along.  Both groups came out of the north with \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2023/11/05/collapse-in-the-north-b2-joins-the-imperium-after-18-months-under-attack/\"\u003ethe collapse of the B2 Coalition\u003c/a\u003e back in late 2023.  They are not in our coalition, but they are groups we’ve worked with before, so I am not sure what our current status is with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that is the way things landed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
