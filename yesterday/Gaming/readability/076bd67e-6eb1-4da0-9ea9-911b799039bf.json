  "text": "It could hint at a different tone for the movie.A new Street Fighter movie has selected its challenger, I mean, director.The Hollywood Reporter says Kitao Sakurai, writer, director, and executive producer on the absurd comedy show The Eric Andre Show, will direct a new film adaptation of Street Fighter for Legendary Entertainment.Capcom is said to be “deeply involved” with the adaptation with the movie already given a March 20, 2026 release date.This will be the latest attempt at bringing Street Fighter to the big screen, though who can ever forget the 1994 film starring Jean-Claude Van Damme as Guile, Ming-Na Wen as Chun-Li, and the late Raul Julia as M. Bison. A masterpiece, even if critics at the time didn’t think so.No word yet on casting, but you can probably expect to see some of your favorite Street Fighter characters appear in this one. A previous version of this film initially had Talk to Me directors Danny and Michael Philippou attached to helm the film, but they departed the project in the summer of last year. The choice of Eric Andre Show alum Sakurai could mean that Legendary is moving in a new, more absurdist direction for the film. As a fan of the more cartoony elements of Street Fighter, I’m actually excited if this is the case.In the meantime, you can play the most recent Street Fighter game, Street Fighter 6 which recently released its newest fighter, Mai Shiranui.
