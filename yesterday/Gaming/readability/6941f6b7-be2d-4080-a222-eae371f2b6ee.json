Lord of the Rings Online I had been bopping around Ost Guruth long enough.  I had finished up some of the deeds, done the regular series of quests, and now I just wanted to go talk to Radagast and get myself finished with Book II. Sometimes you just feel like grinding mobs… And, honestly, finishing up these days is not too bad.  There was a time when you really needed a fellowship get the final bit done… either that or totally over level the content and come back and solo it.  Anyway, Radagast has a few warm ups for you, before he is ready to get you onto the final track. He never looks at me when he speaks… Once you’re ready, you can grab the solo version of the instance, which basically buffs you so you can handle the mobs.  The team has a couple of ways of making fellowship stages of the tale soloable.  Anyway, you set out with Radagast to go do things… which is to say, kill things. Wandering off with Radagast Radgast moves with a willful nonchalance, stopping to chat with the critters while some epic tree mob is trying to make chutney out of you five feet away.  Fortunately, the buff is all it is cracked up to be, and the mobs can all be taken.  You wander hither and yon, then go run a task or two… or kill a guy… then you and Radagast wander for a bit more until you run into Red Sonia or Elsa the Bold or whoever we were looking for… look, the one thing that absolutely does not scale up are the tool tips and the quest text, so I have multiple excuses for not reading it.  Anyway, she was happy to see us. Hey, I am here too… and I did all the killing You get to her, then run off for one more task… murder… this time facing off with Ivar the Blood-Handed Engine Driver, at which point the instance is about done.  There there is some narrative back and forth between Elsa and Radagast… which is to say they keep sending you to talk to the other one even though they are all of 30 feet apart… and then you’ve wrapped it up.  Book II complete! 2 down, 6 to go Then it is back to Ost Guruth where I had already picked up the Oatmeal quest which sends you off to Oatbarton, the part of The Shire that sends you off into Evendim and all of that.  I was keen to go get stuck into that.  But I also had the Book III kickoff.  That sent me back to Candaith’s camp… which the stable master was able to help me with… to find out what was up. Candaith said that, for Book III, I needed to go talk to his fellow ranger Halbarad in the North Downs and I was all, “Are you sending me to freaking Elsteldin now?” And yes, he was.  But at least he had a ride to get me there. The ride was good because I had, up to this point, completely neglected anything much out of sight of Bree going north on the Greenway, so I had not bothered to visit the North Downs and Trestlebridge and all of those locales yet.  The thing is, back in the day you totally had to spend some time there.  But, once again, with the xp boosting stone in my pocket, the landscape difficulty xp boost, and my obsessive desire to use up that daily allotment of blue bar, I had totally skipped past the North Downs. And a good thing too. You might wonder what I have against the North Downs.  I mean, it has wargs and goblins and whatever, quests galore, deeds for slaughtering the local fauna, ruins, and all the usual aspects of an early zone in the game.  Hell, Esteldin not only has superior work stations, but a bank in the crafting hall as well.  My crafting alts are all based there. The problem is that it is a large zone, like a West Karana sized zone, and even the updated quests seem determined to make you walk back and forth across the place in a semi-transparent effort to slow your leveling ass down.  The devs cured a lot of that “let’s make you go from Bree to the Brandywine back and forth fourteen times” level of time wasting (in the books that is 75 miles by road, so imagine some poor SOB making that journey over and over because Adso Fartmuffin left his hankie in Crickhollow or whatever), but in the North Downs they had built up so much landscape and they wanted you to see it ALL at least once.  So off you go. Anyway, I show up and Halbarad is all “Hey great to see you, I need you to do me a favor.  Go talk to a guy and then check out if there are, you know, bads hanging out in Fornost.”   And I am all “That is on the other end of the freaking zone and I don’t have any of the stable masters yet and I know you already know the gobbos have the run of the place.”  But he is insistent and knows I have some mithril coins in my pocket, so off I go. But not directly.  First I have to talk to somebody else in camp.  And then I just talk to everybody else, picking up quests just in case I get something I can do along the way and I get not ONE but TWO quests sending me to Evendim.  A slap in the face. I ride on out, checking in along the way to get my orders, which are to check in on the Norbury Gate at Fornost, which is pretty at a distance. Nice gate you got there Norbury Once there, I am to slay 10 goblins and 6 wargs and report back.  I slay my quota, go back to the guy up the road and he says I’d better go tell Halbarad, like I didn’t know that was coming.  At least I have stable master up the road tagged now, so I can let the horse take me back.  In this venture I had to cross the road that led to Evendim… the place I want to go, the place I now have at least three quests for… but I gotta check in with Hal. Hal is appreciative of the effort, but now he has three more quests for me, because the bads in Fornost means he has to put together a council of the north, which is the name of this whole book.  However, the postal workers are on strike or have gone over to the dark lord or something, so I have to deliver the invites.  Three quests. I’ll be doing the calling The first part send me to Othrikar, home of the shopping cart of Angmar, where I am told they really need Dori around in order to commit to the council thing and he’s gone missing and could I please find him.  Off I go, to find he has been waylaid by some Dourhands, so I fight my way into their camp to find him.  Then once I do, I have to escort him out. Dori is ready to go That was what I will call “Pengail in a hedge maze” as we first have to find his stuff… gems rather than a sword, but same diff… then we have to get free of the place, but it is all narrow walled paths, so we have to fight everybody who respawned, but mobs spawned just for the event.  I get him out, then it is back to Othrikar, where they are now happy to RSVP in the affirmative for the council of the north. After that it is the elves.  They won’t show up until I kill a guy for them.  He is epic, and this is a fellowship quest, but they have a gem that they promise will buff me for the fight, just don’t use it too early.  It works, though you have to let it sit for a moment before it takes effect, so do not start the fight first.  My murder for hire done, the elves will attend. Finally I have to go to Trestlebridge, which is about as far from Esteldin in the zone as you can get, so it is a long ride, and when I finally arrive Millie Bobbie Brown tells me “no dice” on this council of the north.  She’s been doing her own research online and she believes the rangers are lying to her or something.  So it is all the way back to Esteldin… and even though I have stable master now, there is no swift travel, so it is the long ride across the span of the zone. So far I have done four quests and have racked up enough frequent flier miles to get me a round trip to Rivendell.  Look at where I have gone. Back and forth and all around the North Downs Back in Esteldin I go see Halbarad and it very specifically tells me it is December 8 as I enter his study.  I go in and out a couple more times to be sure.  I know they are trying to ground the story in the timeline of the books so we’ll know what should be going on, but really I just want to get this carnival of the north or whatever going so I can go to Evendim. But we’re not done yet.  Halbarad is “Lo!  We must ride to Trestlebridge!” and I am all “You best be teleporting my ass, because I have saddle sores on my saddle sores after your last few jaunts!”  So he agrees, and we’re sent off, arriving to tell Little Nell that the orcs are coming, but she is convinced that this just proves the last G-anon drop, that the rangers are setting all this up to grab power. Where we do goeth one, we do goeth alle But then the orcs DO attack and we fight and defeat them and Nellie is repentant and we defeat the orcs despite this being another fellowship instance.  After the fight she apologizes further and says she regrets voting for the Witch King now and they were going to take away her Estelcaid benefits and it is getting embarrassing for everybody present. That past, Halbarad gives us a hearty, “My work here is done!” even though he sat at the back of the fight and mostly coached, and leaves me high and dry in Trestlebridge. Sure man, whatever you have to tell yourself That plays like this in my head. Know your memes! So I ride back across the zone… AGAIN… to find that MF and corner him in his office where he says I really should speak to Strider who is in Rivendell and he’ll send me there, swift travel, no cost, so I go. There I speak with Aragorn while Ned Stark stands across the room looking moody, and the game makes a point of telling me it is now December 24, so somewhere 16 days have elapsed.  Aragorn sends me to speak to Elrond about the next stage and also to ask after his daughter.  So I am riding across another zone… smaller, but still more round trips. It is pretty to look at, if you have the time I speak to Elrond who offers me up the first quest in Book IV.  So Book III is done and Book IV is RED to me, so I can ignore it for a while, so I am off the hook for the epic storyline for a while. Another stamp in my frequent epics book I then go back to Aragorn to wrap that up, but then I need to go check on his sword then come back and then he has some other task for me to do and it involves going to Evendim. I take that quest, spend the mithril coin because I’ve had enough of slow travel for the day, and end up in Tinnudir, but I do not even care.  I turn the quest in, tell the guy I’ll be back to visit soon enough, go find the stable master and spend another mithril coin… darling, do you think I am made of mithril coins… and swift travel to Oatbarton. It is raining out, I am sore, and I have leveled up again so the initial quests are now light blue to me, but at least I am in Evendim. Back in Oatbarton again! This feels a bit like an EVE Online adventure, where before I can actually start what I set out to do I end up having to have a whole pre-adventure before I can really get going.  But I have a book done and I am where I set out to be at last.",

Ost Guruth where I had already picked up the Oatmeal quest which sends you off to Oatbarton, the part of The Shire that sends you off into Evendim and all of that.  I was keen to go get stuck into that.  But I also had the Book III kickoff.  That sent me back to Candaith’s camp… which the stable master was able to help me with… to find out what was up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCandaith said that, for Book III, I needed to go talk to his fellow ranger Halbarad in the North Downs and I was all, “Are you sending me to freaking Elsteldin now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yes, he was.  But at least he had a ride to get me there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ride was good because I had, up to this point, completely neglected anything much out of sight of Bree going north on the Greenway, so I had not bothered to visit the North Downs and Trestlebridge and all of those locales yet.  The thing is, back in the day you totally had to spend some time there.  But, once again, with the xp boosting stone in my pocket, the landscape difficulty xp boost, and my obsessive desire to use up that daily allotment of blue bar, I had totally skipped past the North Downs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a good thing too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou might wonder what I have against the North Downs.  I mean, it has wargs and goblins and whatever, quests galore, deeds for slaughtering the local fauna, ruins, and all the usual aspects of an early zone in the game.  Hell, Esteldin not only has superior work stations, but a bank in the crafting hall as well.  My crafting alts are all based there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem is that it is a large zone, like a West Karana sized zone, and even the updated quests seem determined to make you walk back and forth across the place in a semi-transparent effort to slow your leveling ass down.  The devs cured a lot of that “let’s make you go from Bree to the Brandywine back and forth fourteen times” level of time wasting (in the books that is 75 miles by road, so imagine some poor SOB making that journey over and over because Adso Fartmuffin left his hankie in Crickhollow or whatever), but in the North Downs they had built up so much landscape and they wanted you to see it ALL at least once.  So off you go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I show up and Halbarad is all “Hey great to see you, I need you to do me a favor.  Go talk to a guy and then check out if there are, you know, bads hanging out in Fornost.”   And I am all “That is on the other end of the freaking zone and I don’t have any of the stable masters yet and I know you already know the gobbos have the run of the place.”  But he is insistent and knows I have some mithril coins in my pocket, so off I go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not directly.  First I have to talk to somebody else in camp.  And then I just talk to everybody else, picking up quests just in case I get something I can do along the way and I get not ONE but TWO quests sending me to Evendim.  A slap in the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ride on out, checking in along the way to get my orders, which are to check in on the Norbury Gate at Fornost, which is pretty at a distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_133450\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

rather than a sword, but same diff… then we have to get free of the place, but it is all narrow walled paths, so we have to fight everybody who respawned, but mobs spawned just for the event.  I get him out, then it is back to Othrikar, where they are now happy to RSVP in the affirmative for the council of the north.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that it is the elves.  They won’t show up until I kill a guy for them.  He is epic, and this is a fellowship quest, but they have a gem that they promise will buff me for the fight, just don’t use it too early.  It works, though you have to let it sit for a moment before it takes effect, so do not start the fight first.  My murder for hire done, the elves will attend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally I have to go to Trestlebridge, which is about as far from Esteldin in the zone as you can get, so it is a long ride, and when I finally arrive Millie Bobbie Brown tells me “no dice” on this council of the north.  She’s been doing her own research online and she believes the rangers are lying to her or something.  So it is all the way back to Esteldin… and even though I have stable master now, there is no swift travel, so it is the long ride across the span of the zone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far I have done four quests and have racked up enough frequent flier miles to get me a round trip to Rivendell.  Look at where
