  "description": "Are you hoping to find all Tea Bowls for Rikyu in Assassin's Creed Shadows? There are seven of these items scattered all over Japan, so it might seem like a tall order at first. However, you should be able to acquire everything that you need with a bit of exploration and campaign progression.Where to find all Tea Bowls for Rikyu in Assassin's Creed ShadowsThe tea bowl items are part of a quest aptly called Tea Bowls for Rikyu. However, the quest itself won't be available right from the get-go as there are a few requirements. Here's the gist:You must complete the arc to hunt down the Golden Teppo, a member of the Shinbakufu.You meet an NPC named Sen no Rikyu along the way. You also need to find other stuff, like the kosode and tea merchant.It's up to you whether you confront Otama or Wakasa. Either way, you have to deal with the Golden Teppo.Continue and finish the entire arc until Naoe and Yasuke meet up to reach Act 2 of the campaign.Sen no Rikyu should then appear as an NPC in the People of Yamashiro section of the Objectives board. Where to find Sen no Rikyu and the tea bowls?To start the Assassin's Creed Shadows Tea Bowls for Rikyu quest, you have to return to Sen no Rikyu's home in Kyoto. It's just south of the northern kakurega building and west of the Imperial Palace.After talking to Rikyu, you're asked to find seven tea bowls that he can add to his collection. Here's a quick summary:Six of these can be purchased from merchants in various towns. Each one costs 125 mon.The seventh and final item can be acquired once you defeat The Wise, a member of the Shinbakufu group. Where to find the Osaka ornament vendor?For our first example, let's head over to Sakai in the Izumi Settsu region. The ornament vendor in this village is fairly close to the Port of Sakai marker. Talk to the NPC and buy the tea bowl for 125 mon. Map of locations of the remaining tea bowlsThe map above shows the locations of the other Tea Bowls for Rikyu in Assassin's Creed Shadows. These are all from ornament vendors in various villages and settlements:Yamashiro: Kyoto - Fairly close to the southern kakurega building.Omi: Sakamoto - North of the kakurega building and Sake Brewery.Omi: Azuchi - From the Sokenji Pagoda fast travel point in the city proper, keep going southwest across the bridge until you stumble upon the vendor's stall.Wakasa: Obama - Thanks. Make your way to the city and tag the Obama Guard Tower fast travel point. Then, go directly southeast to reach Kara Market.Tamba: Kameyama - Right next to the kakurega building, which is actually further south of the main castle. The Wise and the Classic Tea Bowl CollectionTo get the last Assassin's Creed Shadows Rikyu tea bowl, you need to eliminate The Wise, one of the members of the Shinbakufu group. To be fair, this task might take you a while:Continue progressing through the campaign by taking out Shinbakufu members and tackling Yasuke's and Naoe's personal quests. Eventually, you'll see information about The Wise in the Objectives board.You have to go to the Yamato region, which has level 35 enemies.Next, you must talk to a shrine maiden named Fuyu. She's in Omiwa Shrine in the Nara Heartland sub-region.Proceed further into this arc, where you'll broker a peace treaty between two warring clans.Later on, the true identity of The Wise will be revealed. To no one's surprise, it's the monk leader Joken Hokkyo.Chase down Hokkyo and kill him. You'll then receive the Winds of War legendary kusarigama and the Classic Tea Bowl Collection. Should you invite your friends or enemies for the tea ceremony?Return to Sen no Rikyu and hand over all the items that you've collected. You're then asked if you want to invite friends or enemies for the tea ceremony. Here's what happens:Invite friends - There's a short scene where Naoe, Yasuke, and Junjiro have tea together.Invite enemies - This leads to a mini-quest called Fish in a Barrel. High-value targets from the other assassination boards (i.e. non-Shinbakufu members) may appear in the courtyard, and you can take them out. In our playthrough, we only ended up with one target. We can't confirm if this is due to having cleared other boards or if it's just a randomized selection.Regardless of what happens, killing the target causes Sen no Rikyu to scold you for your actions. Tea Bowls for Rikyu quest rewardRegardless of your decision on who to invite to the ceremony, you'll still receive the following rewards:Tea Room - Building for your hideout.Standard Tea Accessories - Hideout decoration.Basic Tea Accessories - Hideout decoration.Sen no Rikyu - Unlocks Sen no Rikyu as an additional scout.That does it for our guide on how to complete Tea Bowls for Rikyu in Assassin's Creed Shadows. If you like roaming around in Japan, then you probably want to tackle other quests, such as The Butterfly Collector.",
