We like Flexispot because it offers quality electric standing desks with all the features you'd want at a fraction of the price compared to other more well-known models. We rated Flexispot's highes- end model, the E7 Pro, the best overall standing desk of 2025. I've been using a Flexispot desk for years now and wouldn't pay more for a \"better\" desk.Featured in this articleYou can quickly browse through all of the listed products on sale above. For more information on each product and why they are worth your consideration, read through below.Flexispot E7 Pro Desk starting at $399.99Our favorite standing desk for 2025For Base Only, Tops Starting at $80Flexispot E7 Pro Electric Standing DeskThe E7 Pro is the creme de la creme of Flexispot's standing desks. It's recent released so it isn't nearly as heavily discounted as the other models. Currently it costs $399.99 (normally $599.99) for the base only and desktop surfaces start at $80. The E7 Pro features the best build quality of the three listed here, and it certainly shows with a weight capacity of a whopping 440lbs. Flexispot claims the motor for the E7 Pro is superior to the standard dual motor setup you'll find in the E5 and E7 and other brands, offering smoother and faster movement. You also get more cable management options included than even the E7. The Flexispot E7 Pro comes with the same 15-year warranty as the E7 on all metal, mechanical, and electrical parts and components, including the motor.Flexispot C7 Ergonomic Chair for $229Flexispot C7 Ergonomic ChairThe Flexispot C7 offers a ton of features that are typically reserved for much more expensive chairs. This includes an automatically adjusting lumbar system, adjustable seat depth, adjustable armrests, adjustable seat tilt, adjustable headrest, 128 degrees of recline, and more. There's a newer C7 Max chair available starting at $450 which features a thicker seat cushion, greater recline adjustability, and 5D armrests, and the option to add a built-in footrest.Flexispot E5 Desk starting at $199.99For Base Only, Tops Starting at $80Flexispot E5 Electric Standing DeskThe Flexispot E5 desk is, in my opinion, the best value electric standing desk while still offering all the premium features you'd want. Right now it costs $199.99 (normally $379.99) for the base only and desktop surfaces start at $80. The Flexispot E5 is the least expensive model featuring dual motors, which are preferred over a single motor because they can support more weight (in this case 287lbs max) and they last longer because the stress is evenly distributed. The desktop is supported by a double crossbeam structure so that your surface is evenly supported to prevent any sagging. Most standing desks in this price range only have legs with a two-stage column, but this one features a three-stage column, which supports a greater vertical range (in this case 23.6\" to 49.2\"). An anti-collision feature, a must-have in all desks, will stop the desk when it detects obstruction of the motor. Finally, the keypad controls offer three memory presets and a timer to remind you when to swap sit/stand positions. The E5 comes with a 10-year warranty on all metal, mechanical, and electrical parts and components, including the motor.Flexispot E7 Desk starting at $299.99For Base Only, Tops Starting at $80Flexispot E7 Electric Standing DeskThe E7 currently costs $299.99 (normally $499.99) for the base only and desktop surfaces start at $80. For an extra $140, the Flexispot E7 offers better build quality, a higher weight threshold, more included accessories, and a longer warranty. The lifting capacity has been upgraded from 287lbs to 355lbs. Aesthetically, the legs look more professional, with laser-welded seams, powder-coated finish, and no visible holes. The advanced keyboard has been upgraded with an LCD display, more memory presets, a built-in USB charger, and a child-lock function that's a necessity for those of us with inquisitive toddlers. The E7 also comes with a built-in cable tray under the desk to stow away all of your messy wiring. Finally, the Flexispot E7 boasts an increased 15-year warranty on all metal, mechanical, and electrical parts and components, including the motor.Flexispot E7L L-Shaped Desk starting at $499.99For Base Only, Tops Starting at $80Flexispot E7L L-Shaped Electric Standing DeskAn L-shaped desk is the best way to take advance of room corners that are otherwise hard to utlize efficiently. Fortunately, Flexispot makes an L-shaped variant of its E7 desk, with the frame starting at $449.99. You'll only need to add $80 to get a 63\"x47\"x24\" chipboard desktop surface included. The desk boasts a triple motor system (one for each leg) with a maximum weight capacity is 330 pounds and a height range of 25\" to 50.7\". The keyboard features a digital display, four memory presets, a built-in USB charger, and a child-lock function. Like the E7, the E7L includes a 15 year warranty.Consider getting a desk frame here and the desktop surface elsewhereI have three standing desks. One of the standing desks included a desktop, however for the other two desks I sourced on my own. For one of them I purchased a massive 74\"x26\" maple veneered countertop from Ikea for $199. For the other one I purchased a 48\"x25\" solid wood countertop from Home Depot and finished it myself. There are more options available where you could save money, opt for a better quality material, or both. Just remember to abide by the weight limitations.How does Flexispot compare to other brands?I can only speak from personal experience. I own a Jarvis Fully, a Vari Ergo, and a Flexispot E5. All three are excellent desks that have caused me no problems whatsoever in the 3+ years of owning them, and that's the point. The Flexispot E5 is considerably less expensive than the other two options, and yet I don't really see where much of that cost is going. For a similar price of a barebones $600 Jarvis standing desk (which is now owned by MillerKnoll), you could get the top end Flexispot E7 Pro and still come out with a few hundred dollars left over.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
