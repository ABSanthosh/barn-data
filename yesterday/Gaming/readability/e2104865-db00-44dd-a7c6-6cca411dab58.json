It features a 14\" 2880x1800 OLED display, AMD Ryzen 9 8945HS processor, GeForce RTX 4060 GPU, 16GB of DDR5-6400MHz RAM, and a 1TB M.2 SSD.

It should play undemanding or older games just fine on the 2880x1800 display, however you'll most likely have to drop the resolution to 1080p to play newer, more demanding games at a comfortable framerate. The RTX 4060 supports DLSS 3.0 for a welcome FPS boost to any game that is compatible with the technology..
