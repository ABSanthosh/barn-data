  "text": "As I did last year, I went in and did the Winter Nexus event in EVE Online twice… which is to say, I did it on two different characters. Winter Nexus 2024 is here The thing about the Winter Nexus is that it is considerably easier than the Crimson Harvest event to complete, largely because it has the whole mining/harvesting aspect to it, something that was removed from the Crimson Harvest quite a while back, though the fact that activities advanced the progression more quickly cannot be left out.  The Winter Nexus felt like less of a slog. All the points earned and rewards obtained The Winter Nexus has three paths one can take to complete it, by which I mean earn all the event points to get the final prize on the list.  I think of these as “the hard way,” “the easy way,” and “the fun way.” The hard way is the combat site route which, if r/eve is to be believed, was best done with a marauder if you wanted to be successful, or in an otherwise well tanked, high DPS ship.  That meant “no poors” as sites are competitive so if you don’t bring the big guns somebody is going to warp in with you and take the lion’s share of kills and loot. These site were also a bit of a gank magnet as a blingy marauder or faction battleship fit is often worth the effort and sacrifice. If you have the right ship and not much competition in the area, this is probably a pretty easy way to finish up the event.  The hard part is the need to invest in a ship up to the job and having to contest every site when you don’t have the area to yourself… also, the gank potential. Anyway, I take all that on faith because I did not do any of the combat sites. I did things the easy way.  The easy way is to go fit out an Endurance mining frigate, head out to one of the storm areas, then hit ore sites and mine away semi-afk.  I mean sure, there is a competition issue at times. We’re all fighting to get that last unit of ice here That was a problem very early in the event when everybody is rushing in to try and get it done right now, but as time went along the sites ended up being less populated. Mining away in a less crowded site Aside from the need to change rocks or react to an update every 10 mins or so, it is a pretty AFK process if you are in a quiet field, so I did most of the even during the day while working.  My work computer is on a desk 90 degrees off from my home computer, so I just had to turn and look every so often.  Sure, sometimes my Endurance sat there for a long time idle… just keep drones out to take care of the occasional rat spawn… but things moved along. This might also account for my high time played for EVE Online this month… though that makes up for some of the time when I am playing but tabbed out into DOTLAN or some other utility site to help me play. And in the final stage, where you turn in your ice, you get an event box to open up that has some items of various value. ORE Green Salvage Box Sometimes you get a special one.  This is where the ISK value of the event comes in and there are people just farming for that.  You’ll see a huge spike on the MER related to this. Selling a batch of Overseer’s Effects I did attempt to do some of the event the “fun” way, by scanning down event data sites.  This is also, to some extent, the quickest way for me to advance my overall event points. Into a Winter Nexus data site These sites were considerably easier than the Crimson Harvest sites, at least to hack.  They were still level IV sites for scanning, which makes them a bit of a challenge for any new player.  But if you could get to one, they were quick to finish. This was a tough one… and it was easy Because the sites are quick and easy and the clear fast way to advance the event, they are also popular.  Once again, if you can find a quiet corner where they are spawning, they can be a bounty of rewards.  But if you get a couple other people working them… or just one other person who is faster than me at scanning… and it doesn’t take much to be faster than me… and then it turns into sites disappearing as you scan them or landing in sites to find that other person already there and it starts being a bit exasperating. I did try to expand out into low and null sec with this.  In low sec the hunters were out in force.  I landed a ways off of one site in my Buzzard cloaked and watched as somebody in a Heron landed only to have an Astero decloak, tackle them, then blow them up.  There was a post on r/eve about how PvE players overestimate the danger of low sec space because, with care, you can avoid getting blown up very often.  But if you don’t want to get blown up at all, and most PvE players, the risk is too great relative to high sec. I was more successful in null sec, using a filament to go out there, though eventually I got greedy and hit one too many sites in a system and found somebody waiting for me.  They hunt you in null sec as well, but not as fervently as they do in low sec, or such is my opinion.  If I see in the intel channel that somebody is rolling through our space in a Heron, I generally just assume they are safe to ignore and pay them no mind. After a bit of that I just went back to mining… and it was fine.  I finished the event and it wasn’t too tough, so I thought i could do it again on at least one more character.  But I got them setup and decided I wasn’t really feeling.  The rewards were fine relative to the effort.  I am just not one of those people who can grind past a certain point, and the event was starting to feel like a bit of a grind after two characters. It was fine for what it was, and the rewards were suitable… but it became repetitive.  Even doing the data sites wasn’t calling to me after that.  So I was done.",

event, they are also popular.  Once again, if you can find a quiet corner where they are spawning, they can be a bounty of rewards.  But if you get a couple other people working them… or just one other person who is faster than me at scanning… and it doesn’t take much to be faster than me… and then it turns into sites disappearing as you scan them or landing in sites to find that other person already there and it starts being a bit exasperating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did try to expand out into low and null sec with this.  In low sec the hunters were out in force.  I landed a ways off of one site in my Buzzard cloaked and watched as somebody in a Heron landed only to have an Astero decloak, tackle them, then blow them up.  There was a post on r/eve about how \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1hn66xc/the_vast_majority_of_pve_players_heavily/?utm_source=share\u0026amp;utm_medium=web3x\u0026amp;utm_name=web3xcss\u0026amp;utm_term=1\u0026amp;utm_content=share_button\"\u003ePvE players overestimate the danger of low sec space\u003c/a\u003e because, with care, you can avoid getting blown up very often.  But if you don’t want to get blown up at all, and most PvE players, the risk is too great relative to high sec.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was more successful in null sec, using a filament to go out there, though eventually I got greedy and hit one too many sites in a system and found somebody waiting for me.  They hunt you in null sec as well, but not as fervently as they do in low sec, or such is my opinion.  If I see in the intel channel that somebody is rolling through our space in a Heron, I generally just assume they are safe to ignore and pay them no mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a bit of that I just went back to mining… and it was fine.  I finished the event and it wasn’t too tough, so I thought i could do it again on at least one more character.  But I got them setup and decided I wasn’t really feeling.  The rewards were fine relative to the effort.  I am just not one of those people who can grind past a certain point, and the event was starting to feel like a bit of a grind after two characters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was fine for what it was, and the rewards were suitable… but it became repetitive.  Even doing the data sites wasn’t calling to me after that.  So I was done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
