  "text": "Big performance, little spend plus fresh deals on SSDs and GPUs Image credit: iBUYPOWER and PNY If I had to pick one prebuilt gaming rig off the interweb today, this iBUYPOWER Element Pro deal would be it. Ryzen 9 7900X paired with an RX 9070 XT for $1,499 feels like the right kind of overkill without tipping into daft money. You get 32GB DDR5 RAM, 2TB SSD storage, and a big 360mm liquid cooler straight out of the box. It’s one of those builds where you don’t have to stress about upgrading anything for a good while. Gaming, streaming and editing are all covered. Plus, there are a few handy storage and SSD deals on today too if you’re looking to round things out. Let's get into it: At $1,499, this prebuilt honestly looks like a bit of a steal. Ryzen 9 and RX 9070 XT in a setup that’s already water-cooled—if I didn’t want to faff about building my own right now, I’d probably just go for this. If I was after a sharp-looking gaming laptop that won’t melt my desk, this would be on the list. Ryzen AI 7 and RTX 5070 in a 15-inch OLED panel at 165Hz—honestly looks like a tidy middle ground between power and price. A GPU with no markup is insane at the moment. I wouldn’t usually expect 16GB VRAM on a mid-range card like this, but here it is. Feels like a good shout if you’re trying to future-proof a 1080p or 1440p setup without pushing too far into premium territory. Feels like a solid price on what’s still one of the quickest drives going. I’ve got no time for waiting on game load screens, and this would definitely keep things snappy. Plus it’s sorted for PS5 if that’s your thing. I used to think console storage upgrades were a bit of a pain but this kind of thing makes it easy. PS5 ready, heatsink included, just slot it in and you’ve doubled your space without much fuss. This would probably be my pick for slotting into a PS5 or backup gaming rig. It’s quick enough for whatever you throw at it, heatsink’s already on there, and Crucial’s stuff doesn’t usually cause any drama. Doesn’t get much simpler than this: heatsink, 1TB capacity, Gen4 speeds, and no messing about. I’d probably throw one in a second machine or keep it on hand for a quick PS5 upgrade.",
