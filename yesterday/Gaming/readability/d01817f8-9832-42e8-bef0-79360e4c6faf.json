  "text": "Elden Ring Nightreign already has a duos mode mod. Luke Yui - yes, the same Luke Yui behind the Elden Ring's Seamless Co-op and Sekiro's co-op mod - had a mod up and running within hours of Nightreign's launch to support pairs of players that would rather play as a duo instead of Nightreign's requirement to pop you into a three-player fireteam. Elden Ring Nightreign: 2 player demonstration (w/ no EAC \u0026 mod compatible) Elden Ring Nightreign: 2 player demonstration (w/ no EAC \u0026 mod compatible).Watch on YouTube \"There will be more to come, but whilst the current game lacks 2-player modes, this mod will be available in this state,\" Yui wrote on his Nexus Mod page (thanks, Gamespot). \"This mod will be expanded on in the future. \"There's no way to get banned using this mod unless you modify it with the intent of connecting to vanilla players,\" Yui added, noting that compatibility hadn't been tested against other mods. As Ed wrote in his review, he wouldn't recommend Nightreign as a solo game at this point as it's \"clearly not the intended way to play\". However, it seems FromSoftware is aiming to respond to the current backlash to make solo play more feasible, with the studio previously stated it was considering a two-player option post-launch, acknowledging it was \"something that was overlooked during development\". \"FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off is an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour,\" Ed wrote in our Elden Ring Nightreign review. If you've jumped into Elden Ring Nightreign this weekend and have struggled to find a Player 2 - and/or a Player 3 - you're not alone. In a brief statement posted to official Elden Ring social media accounts over the weekend, FromSoftware is recommending players \"restart the matchmaking process\" if they're struggling to find a co-op partner. It later also suggested players check their NAT type.",
