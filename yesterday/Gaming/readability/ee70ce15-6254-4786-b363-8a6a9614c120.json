  "text": "Red Finger sees you using an elevator and carrying out strange work in a facility filled with dodgy wiring and mechanical monsters. It’s your first day on the job at an old research complex, arguably the safest of places to find yourself working. You just know there definitely isn’t anything wrong when you have to take an elevator deep underground so you can input some weird codes into strange terminals. And there’s certainly nothing strange about the elevator having a working sink built into it. Still, you probably paid for an expensive ride to get yourself to work, so you’ll end up making negative money for the shift if you don’t complete the night. So, let’s get to it. This elevator is your main means of getting to the stations you need to locate throughout your shift. You have a paper list of all the codes you have to input at the various terminals. It’s not technically hard to go down the elevator, but it does sting like hell. The wiring in the buttons for the elevator have something wrong with them and they get extremely hot when you press them. You also have to hold the button down to move, resulting in a badly-singed finger as you work through the night. A little cold water from the sink will straighten you right out. If the mechanical monster in the shaft sees you, though, that’s another story. The switch that turns off the light to keep you safe from that critter is messed up, too. This results in having to take care as you work through Red Finger. You need to keep making steady progress toward the basement and the end of your work tasks, but you need to take care not to burn your finger so bad that you can’t keep the lights off when the monster arrives. It’s simple, but deviously tense when you’ve over-burned your finger and you see that machine beast rear its head. Red Finger is available now (for free) on itch.io.
