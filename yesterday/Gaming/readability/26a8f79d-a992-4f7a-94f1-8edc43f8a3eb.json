  "text": "Digital Extremes just brought its TennoCon 2025 livestream to a close after revealing a smorgasbord of information about the future of Warframe and Soulframe.The studio behind the popular multiplayer space ninja action game and its free-to-play fantasy follow-up treated in-person and remote fans to hours of announcements, including a fresh look at never-before-seen gameplay, new cosmetics, and some of the major updates still yet to come in 2025. It was yet another jam-packed showing for the Digital Extremes team as it careens toward the launch of more story expansions for Warframe and the eventual launch of Soulframe.Digital Extremes celebrates TennoCon 2025 with gameplay demos for Soulframe and Warframe. Image courtesy of Digital Extremes.From Warframe’s new The Old Peace Narrative Chapter and the devil-frame Uriel to Soulframe’s fresh gameplay updates, we’ve gathered all of the highlights from today’s TennoCon 2025 livestream presentation for you to check out right here. Plus, whether you’re seeing everything for the first time or just looking for a refresher, we’ve also included information Digital Extremes shared with press during a TennoCon preview event IGN attended earlier this month.SoulframeSoulframe is still very much in development, but that didn’t stop Digital Extremes from providing attendees with a new gameplay deep dive. Just like TennoCon 2024, this year’s Soulframe presentation gives fans a live look at the team’s progress, highlighting all of the improvements, big and small.Extensive customization options are one element Digital Extremes plans to carry from Warframe to Soulframe, with the team doubling down on that idea during TennoCon today. Additionally, while Soulframe Preludes, a private early access build that is open for all this weekend, has largely seen players focus on up-close, methodical combat with swords and shields, the team has been experimenting with other options, including sidearms. More love for fans of two-handed weapons is also something Digital Extremes says is “absolutely” in the works.“You’ll see that, now, the game now supports casting playstyles and archery playstyles,” Digital Extremes CEO Steve Sinclair said during the preview event. “So, there’s a lot of choice now in the game, not just that up-close, sweaty, parry stuff… and because you now have a sidearm, you can mix and match those if you want as well.”Soulframe Gameplay Demo Screenshots - TennoCon 2025The TennoCon 2025 Soulframe gameplay showcase kicked off with a conversation with quest-giver and customization NPC Verminia. After trailing her winged rat friend, fans were able to catch a glimpse an Envoy ability that allows players to transform into a blue butterfly, opening up a window to become closer with nature in the land of Alca while also sneaking up on unsuspecting enemies. As the demo continued, audiences were able to catch glimpse of the Neath'uns underground as well as a fight against a three-headed, corrupted foe known as The Waste Bear.The player featured in today’s build can also be seen casting green magic at their enemies from a distance. The Soulframe team says the combat shown in the TennoCon demo is “more casual” than what’s been offered so far, as players will have the freedom to hurl energy at their foes by using a staff and potentially other tools, too.“Over a year now of players going hands-on with Soulframe in our Preludes pre-alpha builds, we’ve learned so many lessons and built a lot of new features for us as a studio,” Soulframe Creative Director Geoff Crookes said in a statement. “After last TennoCon, we put a huge amount of effort into improving combat fluidity and continued that passionate work into exploring brand new features like player social hubs, asynchronous player messaging with World Trees, among so many other additions. Today, we shared what the latest additions to our next Preludes build would be and beyond. We promise to all existing and future players to keep trying new things outside our comfort zone and work with you to create something we’ve all been looking for.”You can see how things are shaping up, along with a first look at combat against the Bromius Omen Beast and the Wazzard of Wastes, in the TennoCon 2025 Soulframe gameplay trailer below.During a press Q\u0026A session, Digital Extremes shared more about what players can expect to see come to Soulframe in the future. For those hoping to see some version of an extended open Preludes period, the team says it needs more time before committing to any plans, but it at least sounds like the idea isn’t off the table should development progress smoothly.Warframe: The Old PeaceFollowing a week of teasers and excitement from the community, Digital Extremes has revealed that the next major Warframe narrative chapter is an Operator-focused story titled The Old Peace. Centered around a peaceful time in the past, this new chapter is expected to launch later this year.Gameplay footage for The Old Peace reveals a remastered look for players’ Tenno Operators as they bounce between the present and the past. It's a lot to take in, with one lengthy segment revealing a mission that features a crucial bit of fan service: a playable version of Excalibur Prime. This specific Warframe, previously made available only to early Warframe adopters, won’t become available ever again, but The Old Peace will at least allow players to finally step into his shoes for a few cinematic, story-driven sequences.Warframe The Old Peace Screenshots - TennoCon 2025Digital Extremes released a brief teaser for the content alongside its demo debut: “Think far back and remember the long-forgotten tale of Tau, a childhood Sentient friend named Adis, as well as the war-scarring conflict between the Orokin, their creations, and a coalition of Dax Anarch Warriors upon the Perita moon.”The Old Peace will also feature a side story known as The Devil’s Triad. How exactly its contents fit into Warframe lore remains somewhat of a mystery, but we do know that it will introduce two new Protoframes into the mix. Despite fears that Digital Extremes would refrain from releasing more of these human-infused Warframe styles, fans can rest easy knowing that the story content features Protoframes for both Harrow and Wisp.The Devil’s Triad will also serve as a welcome mat for Uriel, the next new Warframe. This Frame is said to be inspired by the devil, featuring glowing red highlights that cover his tar-like design. Details about Uriel’s abilities have yet to be revealed.(Left to right) Protoframe Harrow, Uriel, and Protoframe Wisp pose for The Devil's Triad. Image courtesy of Digital Extremes.Alongside some of The Old Peace’s most notable additions comes the promise of a mysterious new faction and a Tauros Focus expansion, which comes with a new Operator ultimate ability. Digital Extremes is also maintaining its commitment to providing Warframe fans with a solid listening experience by publishing its new song, Lullaby of the Manifold, for free on YouTube. The track was featured in today’s The Old Peace gameplay demo and will become available on most music platforms starting July 21, 2025.Digital Extremes Has More Warframe Content in the WorksThe Old Peace is no doubt the biggest card Digital Extremes has up its sleeve for 2025, but there is so much more in store, too. The swift and sharp Valkyr will receive her Heirloom cosmetic bundle July 21, giving longtime fans of the clawed warrior a collection created in collaboration with community artist Pertti Bahaa. The Warframe team is also partnering with tabletop RPG developer Paizo to create Warframe x Starfinder: Operation Orias, which is set to arrive for tabletop fans this October.Also set to arrive at an unspecified point this fall is what Digital Extremes is calling its “Untitled Fall Update.” It’s set to be one of the most substantial additions to Warframe ever, promising content that includes a ground-up rework for the nature-themed Oberon, a Lavos deluxe skin, and the 62nd Warframe.This new content, along with a host of quality-of-life features, sounds promising, but the real reason to get excited is a new tutorial Quest called The Teacher. The mission will finally introduce a streamlined introduction to how Warframe’s Mod system works as Digital Extremes works to address criticisms regarding its game’s steep learning curve for new players.Future Warframe Updates Incoming Screenshots - TennoCon 2025More about the Untitled Fall Update will be revealed during the September Devstream. In the meantime, players can also look forward to a Warframe Android closed beta in the fall (sign up here), as well as Caliban Prime access. The latter was briefly featured during today’s The Old Peace gameplay showcase and is set to be released before the new Narrative Chapter launches.As for a proper Nintendo Switch 2 Warframe port, Sinclair shared during the Q\u0026A session that the Digital Extremes tech team is “so excited” to utilize the power of Nintendo’s sequel hybrid console, teasing potential upgrades like faster load times. There’s just one problem: they need dev kits.“Our tech team is so excited to take advantage of the high-speed cores and the other really cool features of it,” Sinclair said. “There’s just such a backlog for dev kits. So, yeah, if you know anyone… just one, that’s all it would take. I know our programmers are just, like, ‘Oh, I can’t wait.’ We definitely have plans. When we get a dev kit, we will be doing a custom build for Warframe. Absolutely.”Tau Narrative Chapter coming to Warframe in 2026. Image courtesy of Digital Extremes.Warframe content for 2025 is locked in, with much of it shown off during all of the TennoCon 2025 festivities. For 2026, meanwhile, Digital Extremes is teasing a full-on Tau Narrative Chapter. Information on how it will pick up from where The Old Peace leaves off remains tightly under wraps for now, with no release date or window given, outside of the promise that it will launch next year.10 Years of TennoCon in the BooksSoulframe looks like another ambitious online experience from Digital Extremes, but TennoCon would be nothing without the game that started it all. Warframe Creative Director Rebecca Ford touched on the journey so far when speaking about the 10-year TennoCon anniversary.\"10 years of TennoCon is such a mind-boggling thing to say out loud,” Ford said. “When we first started this celebration event back in 2016, we had no idea it would grow to what it is today. Our community is everything to us; we wouldn’t be here without them. To be able to continue TennoCon and bring together more players in person from around the world and treat them to the latest announcements, hijinks, and simply celebrate the world of Warframe is a privilege we don’t take for granted.”She continued: “The 10th TennoCon has been a deeply special, unforgettable journey. We want to thank our community to Tau and back for joining us on this monumental milestone. See you all next year!”For more on TennoCon, you can read our interview with the Soulframe team from TennoCon 2024, where we learned more about how the fantasy RPG came to life and what its future holds.

To be able to continue TennoCon and bring together more players in person from around the world and treat them to the latest announcements, hijinks, and simply celebrate the world of Warframe is a privilege we don’t take for granted.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eShe continued: “The 10th TennoCon has been a deeply special, unforgettable journey. We want to thank our community to Tau and back for joining us on this monumental milestone. See you all next year!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eFor more on TennoCon, you can read \u003ca data-cy=\"styled-link\" href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/digital-extremes-answers-all-of-our-soulframe-questions-including-warframe-tie-ins-and-more\"\u003e\u003cu\u003eour interview with the Soulframe team from TennoCon 2024\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, where we learned more about how the fantasy RPG came to life and what its future holds.
