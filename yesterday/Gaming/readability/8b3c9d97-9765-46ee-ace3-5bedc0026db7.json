When their former roommate reappears after a 50-year nap, they realize how little they’ve done in half a century – not one goal accomplished, not one dream pursued, not one part of the New World conquered (except for their street and part of Ashley Street).\"In the sixth and final season of the Emmy-nominated comedy, Nandor, Nadja, Laszlo, Colin, and Guillermo will enter the workforce, visit New Hampshire, go to a human dinner party, fête The Baron and conjure a demon – all while trying to find their place and their purpose in this crazy, mixed-up world.\"What We Do in the Shadows: Season 6 Cast and CrewWhat We Do in the Shadows is executive produced by Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi, as well as Paul Simms, Sam Johnson, Sarah Naftalis, Yana Gorskaya, Kyle Newacheck, Garrett Basch, and Eli Bush.
