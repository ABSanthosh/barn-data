  "description": "I think it's kind of under-appreciated how funny Tetsuya Nomura is. In recent years his social media presence has become quite mysterious, in that he'll just kind of drop some kind of cryptic tease on Twitter and then not explain himself. Despite not having revealed a single drop of information about Kingdom Hearts 4 since its announcement three years ago, Nomura hinted at some deeper lore about the series' paopu fruit in a very nonchalant manner. It's just funny at this point! And he's done it again, this time with a Magic the Gathering card. Read more",

  "text": "Image credit: Square Enix/ Wizards of the Coast I think it's kind of under-appreciated how funny Tetsuya Nomura is. In recent years his social media presence has become quite mysterious, in that he'll just kind of drop some kind of cryptic tease on Twitter and then not explain himself. Despite not having revealed a single drop of information about Kingdom Hearts 4 since its announcement three years ago, Nomura hinted at some deeper lore about the series' paopu fruit in a very nonchalant manner. It's just funny at this point! And he's done it again, this time with a Magic the Gathering card. If you didn't know, Magic the Gathering is getting an entire Final Fantasy themed set that will probably single handedly get many people into Magic the Gathering. Yesterday, a whole bunch of cards from the set were revealed, including some special ones with fancy art. Unsurprisingly, everyone's favourite long-haired, long-sworded Sephiroth is a card with two bits of art, one with his regular look, the other his final boss form. It's that second one, \"Safer Sephiroth\", that Nomura has commented on that has me, and many others, wondering if it's actually a nod toward Final Fantasy 7 Remake 3 (or whatever it's called). \"This time around, I drew Sephiroth on both the front and back sides of the card. I actually drew them so that they would join up if placed one on top of the other, so if you manage to get two of the same card and line them up, you'll see how the original illustration looked,\" Nomura explained. \"There is also a reason that the design for Sephiroth is different from the original game, but I unfortunately can't share more about that.\" Of course you can't share more about that, Nomura! When can you! Why even bring it up in the first place? I doubt most people would have even noticed, and now you're going to be fueling fan theories for the next two years. In case you don't know what Safer Sephiroth looked like in the original Final Fantasy 7, his right arm was just a wing. In this new art, he has both arms and that wing. What could this mean? Maybe it's to keep Cloud and co out of arm's way (sorry)? Mostly, I have no clue, I'm just quite tickled by the fact that Nomura seems to get a kick out of dropping comments like these. Anyway, I'm off to sell a couple of organs to be able to afford a few booster boxes of this set because I do actually want that Sephiroth card!",
