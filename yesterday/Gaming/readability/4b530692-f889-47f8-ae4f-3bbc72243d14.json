The May 13th Update The patch notes are long, so I won’t paste them all here in the post, but there are some key ones I do want to mention: Shroud Changes Night Time Changes Weapon Gem Sockets Game and Player Visuals Highlighted Details Of course, if you want to SEE the changes right now, there is a trailer for the update that goes through them pretty thoroughly. Otherwise, I will run through what I think are the important bits. Shroud Changes Rework of the Shrouded Landscapes and Shroud Visuals. The Shroud has received a full visual rework with updated materials and textures. We’ve also rewritten our volumetric renderer to give the Shroud and clouds a higher visual fidelity. Landscape overhauls across the Shrouded zones added more variety, verticality, and reasons to explore. Over 100 new points of interest–from hidden nooks to substantial new encounters–now enrich the Shrouded zones. Many existing locations have also been visually refreshed or reimagined for better gameplay. Some enemies can apply curses or diseases with their attacks. Cures can be crafted from the new resources. New Enemies for Shrouded Areas. The Shroud is now more treacherous than ever, with many new enemies – including all-new creatures and deadly variants. Expect to be surprised, challenged, and occasionally overwhelmed… New crafting resources found only in the Shroud unlock powerful new gear and consumables, including: New armor sets New Spell types Confusion grenades Critter bombs Mobile repair kits for fixing weapons in the field Changes to the Night Night Enemy Patrols – Nighttime enemy activity has been ramped up: Scavenger patrols now roam the roads under cover of night looking for rare resources and items. Keep your torch close… and your weapon closer. Groups of the Fell roam the lands above at night, trying to temporarily spread the Shroud. Night-Blooming Flora – New plants can now be found blooming at night across all biomes. These rare blooms offer unique crafting materials and special food. They are also used for stronger versions of existing potions. Night Temples – Introducing Night Temples, a brand new type of point of interest found in every region of Embervale. These temples: Can only be entered at night: their doors remain sealed during the day. Feature all-new architectural elements and are filled with dangerous traps. Offer exclusive rewards for those who dare to brave their depths. Weapon Gem System Introducing the Weapon Gem System – a new way to empower your weapons with unique effects and abilities. Weapons of higher rarity now have a chance for a gem slot (Note: This does not apply retroactively to weapons acquired before Update 6.) Weapon Gems can drop from powerful enemies and be socketed into eligible weapons. To socket a gem, players must find mystical locations deep in the Shroud: Gem Forges. Gems can be upgraded, recycled, slotted, and removed–providing meaningful customization for your arsenal. Biome Visual Upgrades Across the world, we’ve enhanced the visual quality of several biomes with lush new vegetation, refined landscapes, and reworked textures. These upgrades bring more depth and beauty to exploration, whether you’re climbing a cliffside or crossing a war-torn valley. The Nomad Highlands and Kindlewastes in particular have received a comprehensive visual overhaul, breathing new life into their unique environments. Additionally, many points of interest throughout the world have been reworked–not just in terms of visuals, but also in enemy placement and encounter design, offering more meaningful and immersive challenges. Player Customization Improvements In-game Player Customization Meet Elio Ricci the Barber, a new survivor who can be found and unlocked via a dedicated quest. Once placed in your base, Elio grants access to the full character customization menu, allowing you to tweak your appearance at any time. Several new character presets and customization options are now available. Through newly-added quests, you can also discover additional hairstyles, hair colors, and eye colors hidden throughout Embervale. Tintable Armor \u0026 Vanity Outfits Most armor sets and vanity outfits can now be tinted using a brand-new crafting system: A new tinting station for your base to create and apply color palettes. Color palette items can be found and crafted to create endless customization for most of your existing armor pieces. Those are the big changes, the major themes of the update.  It looks like we have more reason to go into the shroud now… which is good, because honestly on our first run we were pretty successful mostly avoiding the shroud as much as we could. Also, I might have to change our server settings.  Given our first run experience on the new server I set night to last just 4 minutes, because we inevitably just sent somebody back to base to get in bed to get back to daylight.  Now there might be something to do at night.  As long as there are no creepers, I’m good. We will definitely be into the gem thing.  That will give us something else to farm.  Also, despite the note above, I have a wand and an axe that both retroactively got a gem slot. Highlights from the Details CPU performance for multiplayer hosts and dedicated servers has been significantly optimized. Completely needed.  After update 5 we had a lot of server lag issues and had to have G-Portal move us to a new server… and even that, while improving the situation, did not cure it completely. Elite and Boss enemies now drop Legendary Runes, which are required to unlock higher-tier perks of legendary weapons. Interesting.  We’ll have to see this in action. All wand projectiles are now moving noticeably faster. This will increase the likelihood of hitting moving enemies when using wands. There are now two very distinct types of wands: very fast shooting wands and wands with multiple projectiles per shot. Wands needed some help, so this seems worthwhile.  One of my wands ended up becoming a multi-projectile while the other got a gem socket. Repair kits can now be crafted as consumables to restore weapon durability while exploring. Mentioned above as well, but good… especially with wands, which burn out fast.  There isn’t always a repair station when you need one. Increased the XP needed for level ups to balance out the new quests and other ways to gain experience along the journey. Probably fair. A new widget has been added to the map, showing a list of all available fast travel destinations and giving an overview of the current locations of the various survivors. Added colors to quest locations in the world map, indicating the relative difficulty of the quest. The map marker filter menu has been reworked and several improvements have been added to the map markers in general. The map.  I do get worked up about in-game maps.  These all seem good, though you still cannot zoom out far enough to see the whole map even on my big 3440×1440 monitor.  Get on that please. Reworked the layout of the server lists in the join menu. We split up the server list into player-hosted games and dedicated servers which allows for more accurate searches. Reworked the server search-by-IP widget. It now shows the necessary port information and it also allows directly joining the found server. The server finder was okay, but not the best.  You could at least favorite your server so it was always at the top of the list.  This makes things a bit better. And there are a bunch more items on the list.  Initially I will note that the info panels for weapons have more detail.  For example, I no longer need to wonder if what I just picked up was a great 1h weapon or a mediocre 2h weapon because it now tells me which kind of weapon it is. Of course, with any big patch, there are bound to be follow up patches.  They already have one out to address an issue with AMD video card.  Meanwhile, on your first login you’ll have to go through the “Compiling Shaders” process. Shaders compiling While you’re waiting for that you can go put Twitch up in the background as they have some cosmetic drops for the update as well.

It now shows the necessary port information and it also allows directly joining the found server.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe server finder was okay, but not the best.  You could at least favorite your server so it was always at the top of the list.  This makes things a bit better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there are a bunch more items on the list.  Initially I will note that the info panels for weapons have more detail.  For example, I no longer need to wonder if what I just picked up was a great 1h weapon or a mediocre 2h weapon because it now tells me which kind of weapon it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, with any big patch, there are bound to be follow up patches.  They already have one out to address an issue with AMD video card.  Meanwhile, on your first login you’ll have to go through the “Compiling Shaders” process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_134904\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/escompilingshaders.png\"\u003e\u003cimg aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-134904\" data-attachment-id=\"134904\" data-permalink=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/05/14/enshrouded-launches-the-thralls-of-twilight-update/escompilingshaders/\" data-orig-file=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/escompilingshaders.png\" data-orig-size=\"600,255\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026#34;aperture\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;credit\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;camera\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;caption\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;created_timestamp\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;copyright\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;focal_length\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;iso\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;shutter_speed\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;title\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;orientation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;}\" data-image-title=\"ESCompilingShaders\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Shaders compiling \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/escompilingshaders.png?w=500\" data-large-file=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/escompilingshaders.png?w=600\" src=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/escompilingshaders.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"255\" srcset=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/escompilingshaders.png 600w, https://tagn.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/escompilingshaders.png?w=150\u0026amp;h=64 150w, https://tagn.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/escompilingshaders.png?w=500\u0026amp;h=213 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"caption-attachment-134904\"\u003eShaders compiling\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile you’re waiting for that you can go put Twitch up in the background as they have some cosmetic drops for the update as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelated:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eKeen – \u003ca href=\"https://enshrouded.com/news/enshrouded-thralls-of-twilight-update\"\u003eThralls of Twilight Update\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSteam – \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203620/view/529846144626329422\"\u003eThralls of Twilight Patch Notes\u003c/a\u003e (same as above, but on Steam)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
