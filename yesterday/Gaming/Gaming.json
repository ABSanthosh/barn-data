It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. How would you rather spend some unexpected afternoon free time: watching a movie, going for a walk or reading a book? I’d love some extra time to read! I recently found a new-to-me author that I enjoy, Rebecca Searle, and I’m going through all of her books. 2. What did you last cry about? Well, I went to the OBGYN last week, and I had a mini-meltdown when the nice nurse took my blood pressure. I think it’s a little bit of leftover post-traumatic stress from going to the doctor so much last year along with some hormonal stuff (dang this peri-menopause). 3. What would you rather do with a friend: play card games, have a picnic in the park or go to the farmers’ market?

What could you use most right now: cuddles with pets, a hot cup of tea or a nap? I’m drinking a hot cup of tea at the moment, and I’m not too sleepy, so I’ll take the cuddles from the pets. 2. On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the highest, how concerned are you about AI? Girl. As someone who named her daughter after a great science fiction heroine who rises up to help defeat the robots, I’m going to give this a solid 10. I’m freaked out, man! 3.
