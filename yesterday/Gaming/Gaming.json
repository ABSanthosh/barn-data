    "description": "2 Fast 2 Furious is widely considered one of the worst Fast and Furious movies, but it did introduce the world to the Honda S2000 and the joy of going overboard with a custom paint job. If you're looking to add this eye-catching ride to your collection, Lego is adding it as a new kit to its Fast and Furious lineup, and you can preorder it now through The Lego Store for $27 ahead of its June 1 release. 2 Fast 2 Furious Honda S2000 (300 pieces) $27 | Releases June 1 This 300-piece set lets you build a replica of the bright pink Honda S2000 driven by Suki (Devon Aoki) in 2 Fast 2 Furious. It features screen-accurate details like an interior TV monitor, rear wing, grille, wheels, and anime-inspired graphics across the bodywork. While it doesn't have a working steering system like you'd find on bigger Lego Technic builds, the rubber wheels can spin for when you want to make the completed model go vroom. The set also includes a minifigure of Suki. Preorder at The Lego Store Gallery To add to your 2 Fast 2 Furious collection, you can also pick up the Nissan Skyline GTR 319-piece set while itls on sale for $20 (was $25) at Amazon.

    "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-survival-games/2900-5289/",
    "description": "Survival games aren't all created equal, and determining the best survival games is no easy feat, as community consensus can vary wildly. But there's no denying that the genre has become one of the most popular in the gaming industry, seeing several high-profile releases every year and garnering millions of players.When it comes to classifying a title as a \"survival\" experience, you're primarily looking for it to have survival elements, such as a health, food, or thirst bar you need to keep replenishing. There's also usually an end goal when it comes to a survival game, but this isn't always a dedicated story or plot. Some of the best survival games just have a set of goals for you to hit to get you started on your journey, with the rest of the experience being an open sandbox for you to make what you want of it. Funny enough, several of our picks for the best zombie games also land here, as the undead are such a popular enemy in survival games.Check out our picks for the 29 best survival games in the list below, which showcase all kinds of different experiences within the genre but are also widely available in 2025. As a note, this list is in no particular order. These games span all platforms, but if you're looking for even more to play, check out our picks for the best PS5 games, best Switch games, best PC games, and best Xbox games. MinecraftDeveloper: MojangRelease Date: November 18, 2011Platforms: PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo Switch, iOS, AndroidMinecraft is the game that shaped the bulk of the survival genre and a large part of the gaming industry as a whole. Released back in 2011 (following earlier alpha and beta versions), Minecraft is the second-best-selling video game of all time behind Tetris, selling over 300 million copies as of late 2023. It popularized the sandbox style of survival games, allowing players to do whatever they wanted and build anything that came to their mind. It's still a global phenomenon in 2024 and there are plenty of Minecraft spin-offs to satisfy your desire for more of the pixelated franchise. See on Amazon RustDeveloper: Facepunch StudiosRelease Date: December 11, 2013Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PCWhile you might have some strong opinions one way or the other regarding Rust, it's difficult to deny its overall impact on the survival game genre. When Rust was released in 2013, there were few other games like it on the market. It starts you out with nothing but a patch of clothing and you have to claw and scrap your way to simply obtain a simple weapon. From there, you can construct a large base, invade other players' bases, and fight for control over an island. It's not considered as hardcore of a survival game in 2024, and its community is notorious for griefing new players, but Rust is still one of the better survival games you can play today. See on Amazon Ark: Survival EvolvedDeveloper: Studio WildcardRelease Date: June 2, 2015Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, PC, AndroidThere are few survival games with a more enticing description than Ark: Survival Evolved. The game starts you off on an island with no clothing or weapons and you have to scrounge for materials to start building survival necessities. However, in the background, you'll hear some sharp screeches and eventually see your first dinosaur. Ark allows players to kill, tame, and ride all manner of prehistoric creatures to aid them in their survival. It's a one-of-a-kind experience that comes with full base-building and multiplayer elements. A remade version of the game, Ark: Survival Ascended, was surprise-released in 2023; you can check out our Ark tips for new players to help you get off to a good start. See on Amazon ValheimDeveloper: Iron Gate StudiosRelease Date: February 2, 2021Platforms: Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PCEvery so often, a game comes out of nowhere to completely take the gaming industry by storm. In 2021, Valheim became a Steam darling, launching with little hype around it but quickly shooting to the top of the selling charts. If you've played Valheim, you know why it became an instant success. The game's distinct graphical style mixed with Norse lore that's integrated flawlessly with the gameplay instantly hooks new players. Pair those elements with some fantastic base-building and a map begging to be explored, and you have the recipe for one of the best survival experiences on the market. Valheim is still not a complete game in 2024, however, so there's even more content on the horizon for the title. See on Humble SubnauticaDeveloper: Unknown Worlds EntertainmentRelease Date: December 16, 2014Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, PCNo survival game on the market can match what Subnautica brings to the table. The game begins with you crashing onto an alien planet after your spaceship malfunctions. From your escape pod, you emerge and find a world entirely covered with water as far as the eye can see. The only way to survive is by swimming down into the water below, where dozens of unique species of fauna and flora call home. The sheer terror that arises from playing Subnautica is next to none, as several massive underwater creatures are aiming to kill you. Subnautica has few, if any, weak points, as the world is stunning, the exploration is stellar, and the base-building is fantastic.If you've already played Subnautica or want an updated version of the game, check out Subnautica: Below Zero. It's a direct sequel to the original that features a new map, updated mechanics and gear, and all-new ocean creatures to encounter. See on Fanatical DayZDeveloper: Bohemia InteractiveRelease Date: December 16, 2013Platforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCDayZ is another one of the original big survival games to enter the genre, and it's where a lot of veterans got their start. Initially a mod for Arma 2, DayZ is a multiplayer-only survival title where you simply strive to survive. There's no base-building or any additional goals you need to complete. You can either work together with other players on your server to outlast everyone else or you can be a lone wolf, eliminating as many players as possible. DayZ isn't a battle royale title, but it did spawn the creation of H1Z1, which in turn inspired PUBG (and, by extension, Fortnite). See on Amazon Sons of the ForestDeveloper: Endnight GamesRelease Date: February 23, 2023Platforms: PCSons of the Forest is the sequel to the critically acclaimed game The Forest, which was a staple in the survival genre for years. While The Forest is still revered by many fans, Sons of the Forest takes everything up a notch. Just like in the original, you start off deserted on an island with some sinister energy. Right from the beginning, you have to forage for supplies to survive the night. Fortunately, you have a companion named Kelvin to help you at the start, but you can acquire other companions as well. As the game goes on, you can explore the massive island that features dozens of terrifying caves, meet new characters, take part in some story missions, and even design a base so the creatures of the night can't harm you while you try to sleep. See on Steam No Man's SkyDeveloper: Hello GamesRelease Date: August 9, 2016Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, PCWhat started as one of the most-criticized video game launches of all time (due to pre-release hype) has turned into arguably the best turnaround story in gaming history. No Man's Sky was released to critical disdain in 2016, but the developers at Hello Games have never stopped working to deliver the game it initially promised to the community. Recent updates, all of which are free, have transformed No Man's Sky into one of the premier survival games on the market. You can now take part in multiplayer features, such as building a base with a friend. You can also design your own ship and engage with a plethora of new story additions that take place all across the galaxy.The Worlds II update also added the ability to swim underwater and discover new treasures and creatures below the surface. The update also transformed landscapes above ground as well, adding mountain ranges, valleys, and vast plains on countless planets in new star systems. The most recent update in No Man’s Sky is called Relics, and it adds new fossils on planets that you can dig up as well as rebuild them to see what kind of creature the remains came from. See on Fanatical 7 Days to DieDeveloper: The Fun PimpsRelease Date: December 13, 2013Platforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCZombie games were extremely popular back in the mid-2010s, but 7 Days to Die stands out as arguably the best one. It's a survival-horror FPS that features RPG elements, an open world, and a robust crafting system that will have you hooked in no time. There are also terrific base-building mechanics that bring to mind the old tower defense titles, as you have to protect your loot from hordes of zombies knocking at your front door. The plot of 7 Days to Die is also instantly gripping, as you have seven days to prepare yourself for the zombie horde. If you aren't ready, you'll perish. After more than a decade in early access, 7 Days to Die is releasing in full in June 2024, with a new console version to come. See on Amazon The Long DarkDeveloper: Hinterland StudioRelease Date: September 22, 2014Platforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PCThe Long Dark features a plot similar to that of several other survival games: You're a pilot who's crash-landed in the Canadian wilderness and you need to immediately find a way to survive, or else you'll die. While the plot is familiar, The Long Dark takes you on a true journey of survival. There are no other players to help you and the wilderness is full of animals that want to chew on your flesh. Not to mention, the frigid temperatures of Canada are harsh and unforgiving. If you want to survive, you have to think for yourself and take careful measures to simply ensure you can last another day. See on Walmart Conan ExilesDeveloper: FuncomRelease Date: January 30, 2017Platforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PCThe world of Conan the Barbarian has been reimagined in several different games, but the definitive version of the character's world lies in Conan Exiles. A multiplayer survival experience, Conan Exiles is an open sandbox where you have to scrounge, build, and fight in order to survive. You can fend off enemies using basic combat or sorcery and team up with other players to secure your place in the world. The map in Conan Exiles is quite expansive, featuring full cities, dungeons with plenty of loot, and other sights to see. See on Fanatical RaftDeveloper: Redbeet InteractiveRelease Date: May 23, 2018Platforms: Android, PCRaft starts you, and possibly some friends, out on a tiny piece of wood in the middle of the ocean. Your goal is to navigate the vast waters to find debris to expand your raft and try to survive against all of the perils around you. Hungry sharks are waiting to climb aboard your raft and munch on anything they can get their teeth on as well as land creatures such as polar bears and hyenas. After enough crafting, you can eventually make quite an impressive base that's able to sustain itself and fend off enemies. There's also a story in place, allowing you to reach the endgame and partake in additional content. We have Raft guides to help you get going, such as how to unlock all characters. See on Steam AstroneerDeveloper: Redbeet InteractiveRelease Date: May 23, 2018Platforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PCThe point of many survival games is to scrap and claw your way to a point where you're able to sufficiently supply yourself with all the necessities to survive. In Astroneer, you're essentially given those necessities right from the start, as the only survival element you need to worry about is oxygen. As long as you have enough oxygen, you don't have to worry about anything else. Instead, you can focus on the phenomenal exploration and crafting systems Astroneer possesses, which can keep you busy for hours on end. You're able to build massive bases, construct vehicles, and develop crafting stations to sustain anything you build. Astroneer is a huge sandbox that you can get lost in within a matter of minutes. See on Humble GroundedDeveloper: Obsidian EntertainmentRelease Date: July 28, 2020Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, PCGrounded is a survival game where you get to live out the plot from the 1989 film, Honey, I Shrunk The Kids. You play in a massive sandbox that takes place in a house's backyard, but you've been shrunk down to the size of a grain of sand. As a result, everything around you is 10 times larger than it's supposed to be. Insects are now hulking enemies and strands of grass stretch high into the air. To survive, you need to find unique items spread across the map and craft a base to avoid the dangers of the backyard. As an Xbox-published game, it's available on Game Pass for console and PC. See on Amazon Don't StarveDeveloper: Klei EntertainmentRelease Date: April 23, 2013Platforms: PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Android, iOS, PCBoasting some of the most eye-catching graphics in a game, Don't Starve is a brutally challenging survival game set in the wilderness. The world you're thrown into is filled with magic, science, and other strange elements you can discover. There are mysterious creatures to encounter as well as a plethora of items and resources to scavenge. You can build a base to survive the elements, but you won't want to spend a ton of time there, as the world of Don't Starve makes you want to explore every inch. See on Amazon Escape From TarkovDeveloper: Battlestate GamesRelease Date: July 27, 2017Platforms: PCWhile Escape from Tarkov isn't a survival game in the traditional sense, it requires players to survive in an arena of other players and NPC enemies. You have to craft items to stay alive, and a timer hurries you to escape the arena with as much loot as you can carry. The only traditional survival element you have to worry about is your health, but Escape from Tarkov features plenty of other survival aspects that allow it to sneak into the genre and onto this list. The game is a hardcore FPS that demands precision, in-depth knowledge of your surroundings, and a little bit of luck. It also popularized an entirely new genre in gaming, called the \"extraction shooter.\" That's led to, among other things, new and upcoming games, such as a revival of Bungie's Marathon. See on EFT's website Frostpunk Developer: 11 Bit StudiosRelease Date: April 24, 2018Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, PCSurvival games don't always have to revolve around combat, and Frostpunk is one of the better examples of this. Frostpunk is a city-builder survival title that takes place in an alternate version of the 19th century. You're thrust into the role of the leader of a new city that needs to overcome obstacle after obstacle to maintain the city and its citizens. You have to make extremely difficult choices regarding the future of the city while also ensuring it doesn't get reduced to rubble. It's a unique experience in the survival game genre that provides hours of memorable and stressful gameplay. See on Fanatical RimWorld Developer: Ludeon StudiosRelease Date: November 4, 2013Platforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCRimWorld is another city-builder simulator that tests your ability to manage and grow a group of colonists on a science-fiction-inspired civilization. Your colonists need to be taken care of thoroughly, which includes mending their wounds, feeding them, and even monitoring their moods. RimWorld goes extremely in-depth with the simulation of being the leader of a colony, and you'll need to be more than a colonist manager if you want to survive. There's combat with different factions, deep trading systems, a unique crafting aspect, and decisions you have to make for the good of the colony. See on Fanatical Project ZomboidDeveloper: The Indie StoneRelease Date: November 8, 2013Platforms: PCOne of the earliest zombie survival titles to hit the market was Project Zomboid, which took a different approach to the survival genre. The gameplay is unlike any other game, taking place on a giant map that splits whenever you enter a building or other indoor location. Your goal is to survive against hordes of zombies by crafting items, taking advantage of RPG elements, building defenses, and hunting/fishing for food. You also have to contend with your character's inner demons and natural survival needs. Though there are some customizable difficulty options, this game is hardcore, so you'll want to use our guides like how to avoid zombie bites, how to heal, how to forage, and the best skills in Project Zomboid. See on Humble Pacific DriveDeveloper: Ironwood StudiosRelease Date: February 22, 2024Platforms: PlayStation 5, PCThere might not be a more differentiated survival game on this list than Pacific Drive. It's a first-person driving simulator that takes place across different locations in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. All you have is your car and your sense of direction in Pacific Drive, and if you lose either one, you're done for. The game pits you against supernatural forces that want to stop you from driving further and delving into the mysteries of the region. You're able to upgrade your car by using a garage as a base, and there are tons of different ways to make your car stronger. If you check it out, be sure to check out our guide to Pacific Drive secrets and tips. See on Amazon State of Decay 2 Developer: Undead LabsRelease Date: May 18, 2018Platforms: Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PCThe State of Decay franchise is one of the most successful in the survival genre, boasting two titles with a third on the way. While the original State of Decay launched the franchise, it's the second one where everything comes together. State of Decay 2 is a massive improvement over the first game, featuring better survival mechanics, stronger AI, and a much more expansive world to explore. The gameplay loop is very similar to other survival games, forcing you to find resources that you use to craft items for survival. However, the community aspect in State of Decay 2 is where it separates itself from other titles, as you're able to take full advantage of the multiplayer mechanics. See on Steam PalworldDeveloper: Pocket PairRelease Date: January 19, 2024Platforms: Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PCEven though Palworld was only released early in 2024 and it tends to copy some elements from another franchise, it's still one of the better survival games released in recent memory. The survival elements blend perfectly with the Pal-catching gameplay loop, as you're able to use the Pals you catch to produce resources, craft items, and keep your base in working order. Certain Pals can also be used in combat, either against Pal Tower bosses or wild Pals you want to catch. There's no story in Palworld, but the survival elements are abundant for both your character and all of your Pals, making it one of the better survival games to play right now. We've got a list of Palworld tips and tricks to get you started, as well as a roundup of all the Pals in the game, which is currently available on Game Pass. See on Steam KenshiDeveloper: Lo-Fi GamesRelease Date: March 20, 2013Platforms: PCThe real-time strategy and survival genres don't mix often, but Kenshi proves they can work extremely well together. Kenshi is mainly an RPG with survival elements that takes place across a huge sandbox where your imagination tells the story. There's no plot or narrative in place with Kenshi, so you and some companions can travel across the world and become whatever you want to be. You're free to play any role you choose, including that of a simple farmer all the way to an oppressive warlord. See on Humble This War of MineDeveloper: 11 Bit StudiosRelease Date: November 14, 2014Platforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Android, PCFrom the same developers who brought us Frostpunk comes This War of Mine, a military survival simulator that focuses on the effects war has on civilians. The game primarily takes place in a single building, as snipers and enemy troops are waiting outside for anyone to enter their crosshairs. Inside the building, you need to maintain your character's health by feeding them and keeping morale as high as possible. You can scavenge for resources to craft survival items, cook food, and make medicine. You're mainly able to scavenge for resources at nighttime, where you can meet other NPCs who are trying to survive the war just like you. This War of Mine ends when a ceasefire has been called, but the time for that to happen is completely random, giving you no end in sight. See on Fanatical Stranded DeepDeveloper: Beam Team GamesRelease Date: January 23, 2015Platforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PCStranded Deep is a game that takes elements from other survival titles but adds its own spin. The game starts off with your boat crashing on an island, and you need to survive the first few days to have any chance at getting rescued. Getting food, water, and avoiding the sun are your top priorities, but there are also enemies you need to fend off. Stranded Deep takes place both on the island and underwater, both of which are not overly safe. Luckily, you can craft a slew of different items to survive, including bases, vehicles, weapons, and more. See on Steam Planet CrafterDeveloper: Miju GamesRelease Date: March 24, 2022Platforms: PCIf you find yourself playing Minecraft or another sandbox survival game and keep looking up to the sky wondering what it'd be like to design your own planet, then Planet Crafter is right up your alley. Planet Crafter is a terraforming survival game that gives you free rein over an entire planet. You start by making your play habitable by stabilizing its ecosystem, and from there, you can craft new items and structures using the planet's resources and eventually build a small settlement. The game supports up to 10 players on every planet as well, so you and some friends can terraform large chunks of the environment to completely transform it. See on Steam EnshroudedDeveloper: Keen GamesRelease Date: January 24, 2024Platforms: PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|SEnshrouded is a modern survival game with plenty of content to consume, frequent updates from the developers, and an enjoyable gameplay loop. It's an action-RPG that takes place on an open-world map. You have all the basic tropes of a survival game, including base-building, in-depth crafting, and exploration to score more gear for your character and base. The base-building and crafting especially stand out, as you can make a variety of weapons and gear as well as build quite impressive structures. However, at the heart of Enshrouded is a well-laid-out story that forces you to explore every corner of the map and goes hand-in-hand with the game's survival aspects. See on Steam Once HumanDeveloper: NetEase GamesRelease Date: July 9, 2024Platforms: PC, iOS, AndroidOnce Human is a game that can't be defined by a single genre. It's a third-person survival game with RPG elements that takes place in an open world where you can engage in multiplayer with other random players on your server. At the start of Once Human, you're introduced to the story, which involves post-apocalyptic mutations taking over the world, but this takes a backseat to the exploration and survival aspects.Once Human takes place on a huge map that is split up into different zones, each with a corresponding level requirement. To reach new zones with a higher level, you have to complete missions, clear out enemy locations, and keep building up your base. Your level dictates what weapons you can use, the vehicles you can drive, and the base items you can construct. Throughout all of this, though, you have to ensure your character has enough food, water, and stamina to sustain themselves. See on Steam AtomfallDeveloper: Rebellion GamesRelease Date: March 27, 2025Platforms: PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|SAtomfall is a survival RPG title that sees survival elements take a backseat to the worldbuilding and overall plot that the game immediately throws you into. However, the survival elements in Atomfall aren't to be ignored, as you have a heartbeat you have to constantly monitor. The higher your heartbeat, the less stamina you have and the more vulnerable you are. The game also features minimal healing, so keeping your HP up is paramount. Putting survival aside, Atomfall is a fantastic open-world RPG with an engaging story that has multiple endings, difficult combat, and extremely well-designed quests. See on Fanatical",

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What could you use most right now: cuddles with pets, a hot cup of tea or a nap? I’m drinking a hot cup of tea at the moment, and I’m not too sleepy, so I’ll take the cuddles from the pets. 2. On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the highest, how concerned are you about AI? Girl. As someone who named her daughter after a great science fiction heroine who rises up to help defeat the robots, I’m going to give this a solid 10. I’m freaked out, man! 3. Something unexpected that happened to you recently? Well, I saw a bobcat out of my window when I was at work last week! (See the pic at the top.)

    "description": "Rosie, being scientifically oriented, has an affinity for baking. She appreciates the precision and thinks of it like working in a lab, except one where you’re able to sample the fruits of your labor. We’re all so excited because she opened her new French bakery, La boulangerie de Rosie, in Novato this weekend. I know! Very exciting. Unfortunately for Rosie, Marnie was her baking assistant, but it doesn’t look like that’s going to work out because Marnie has no regard for recipes or measurements…or really, any kind of precision. Actually, Rosie didn’t come up with the idea for the bakery herself. Tabs, as you know, was very forwarding thinking, and toward the last years of his reign he planned to open a high-end cat bakery that also catered to humans (but also cats), and Rosie borrowed the idea. We can safely assume that if Tabs had gotten the business off the ground, it would have been a huge success. Yup, everything that cat touched turned to gold. 💛 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 856 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
