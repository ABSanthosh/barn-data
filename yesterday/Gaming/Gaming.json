    "description": "Mado Monogatari: Fia and the Wondrous Academy $50 | TBA 2025 Preorder at Amazon Did you know the popular Puyo Puyo puzzle games are actually spin-offs of a dungeon crawling RPG series called Mado Monogataru? It's true--and the latest entry, Mado Monogatari: Fia And The Wondrous Academy, is getting an official English release on Nintendo Switch, PS5, PS4, and Steam later this year. While we're still waiting for a final release date, preorders are available for $50 at Amazon. Mado Monogatari: Fia and the Wondrous Academy $50 | TBA 2025 Mado Monogatari: Fia and the Wondrous Academy is a top-down dungeon crawling RPG where players explore randomly generated dungeons as Fia, and battle monsters--including the iconic Puyo blobs--collect treasure, and level up Fia's skills. The other half of the game is set in a magic academy that acts as a town hub where players will chat with NPCs, play minigames, craft weapons, and more. The game will include English and French text options with Japanese voice acting.The Mado Monogatari: Fia and the Wondrous Academy standard edition is the only version of the game announced so far, and the physical edition will be available on Nintendo Switch, PS5, and PS4. Digital preorders are also available on the PlayStation Store, Switch eShop, and Steam. Preorder at Amazon Mado Monogatari is a long-running dungeon crawling RPG series that started back on 1990 on the MSX and PC-98. The series started as a first-person dungeon crawler akin to other classic RPGs like Wizardry and Shin Megami Tensei, but other entries have experimented with other styles of dungeon crawling, including Fia and the Wondrous Academy's top-down Mystery Dungeon-style gameplay. Despite running for over thirty years, Fia and the Wondrous Academy is only the second Mado Monogatari game to get an English localization. The previous game in the series, Sorcery Saga: Curse of the Great Curry God, was also launched in North America on Vita in 2014 and then ported to PC in 2018. Like Fia and the Wondrous Academy, Sorcery Saga: Curse of the Great Curry God is also a top-down roguelike mystery dungeon with randomized dungeons. If you want to check it out, you can grab it for $20 on Steam.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

To retrain and come back fiercer than ever, she pops into the forest looking for a legendary trainer, only to find herself waking up exhausted in front of a picturesque tea shop. The Steam demo that follows will see you harvesting plants, making tea, and arguing a lot with the shop's owner, a gentle giant who thinks that maybe what Alta really needs is just some time to rest. After all, you can't fail at drinking a cuppa. Read more",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Which would you rather have: an epic eyeshadow collection or an epic lipstick collection? My eye makeup game has been super minimal for the past couple of years, so epic lipstick collection it is! 2. If you could only wear one type of pants for the rest of your life, which would you pick: yoga/workout leggings, jeans, chinos or overalls? Although I like the idea of wearing pants with stretch, I do not love the idea of wearing leggings that hug my butt so closely for the rest of my life. UGH. But I guess I’d go with yoga/workout leggings, simply because I can’t imagine working out in jeans or chinos. And I guess one could dress leggings up for formal occasions? 3.

    "description": "Finally! A sunny week. 🌞 This is such a great time of year in the Bay Area. It’s still a bit wintry, but we usually get a few weeks in late February that are ridiculously perfect. Sunny and crisp with highs in the upper 60s to low 70s. We’ve gotten more rain than usual (the new usual) for three years in a row, including this one, which is weird because we had a drought that lasted a decade! I know it’s temporary, but for three years the weather has been, like, retro normal. Trees are healthy again, the streams and rivers are flowing — it’s bizarre! This is the time of year one of my tabby’s favorite flowers bloomed. Tulips! He loved almost everything about them. (“Almost” because he did not like the fact that they’re toxic.) Rosie loves this time of year too. Not quite spring, but not quite the dead of winter either. During unseasonably warm weeks like this one, the grass starts growing, oak trees start blooming, squirrels are…squirreling, and butterflies and[Continue reading...] The post Select Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 852 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
