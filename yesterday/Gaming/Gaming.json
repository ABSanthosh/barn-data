    "description": "Cyberpunk 2077 is a massive game - and now it's finally out on Mac. Nearly five years on from its original release, CD Projekt Red has delivered a version of the RPG epic for Apple Silicon Mac computers, promising ray tracing support and advanced MetalFX features. So how does the sci-fi adventure hold up on Apple's current-gen computer lineup and what should gamers expect in performance and stability? We put the port through its paces on a range of modern Mac hardware, helpfully supplied by Apple, and the results are intriguing. Read more",

    "description": "Marvel Legends Series Spider-Man Homecoming Animated Mask $130 | Releases September 1 Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Entertainment Earth Everyone has their preferred cinematic incarnation of Spider-Man, and each one has its own unique charms, but one element Tom Holland's MCU Spider-Man nailed is the expressiveness of the hero's eyes while wearing the iconic red suit. It's an effect that many cosplayers put hours of effort into replicating, but thanks to this new Spider-Man Homecoming Animated Mask from the Marvel Legends Series, you can achieve the webslinger's animated eyes with minimal effort. The new replica, which launches on September 1, features moving eye pieces that you can easily control to change the size and angle of the mask's eyes on the, er... fly. If you're interested in adding the collectible to your cosplay wardrobe or Marvel merch collection, you can preorder the Marvel Legends Series Spider-Man Homecoming Animated Mask for $130 on Amazon and Entertainment Earth. Marvel Legends Series Spider-Man Homecoming Animated Mask $130 | Releases September 1 The Marvel Legends Series Spider-Man: Homecoming Animated Mask is based on Peter Parker's Iron Spider suit seen in Spider-Man: Homecoming. Unlike many replica superhero masks and helmets, this one is a full mask made of flexible silicone fabric that covers the wearer's entire head and neck, and is molded to fit around the chin for a movie-accurate look. As mentioned above, the mask features moving eye parts that are controlled via an included wireless remote. You can select between eight pre-configured eye expressions and five programmed routines that cycle between different movements, or manually control them. The mask measures 10.25 inches tall and 7.25 inches wide. A display stand is also included--so even if you don't plan to wear it, you can show it off as a cool set piece in your collection. Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Entertainment Earth Note that while Amazon lists September 1 as the launch date, Entertainment Earth has a more vague October 2025 release date. We're assuming that will be updated to match Amazon's ahead of launch, but in case you're looking to get it as soon as possible, it might be worth sticking with Amazon in case those orders do, in fact, ship earlier. Since Amazon doesn't charge until orders ship, you can always order now and cancel later if you change your mind.The Marvel Legends Series includes numerous other premium collectibles, from action figures and statues to props and accessories. If you're looking for more replica masks and helmets, there are several models available now, including heroes like Iron Man, War Machine, and Star Lord, and Villains like the Green Goblin. Like the upcoming Spider-Man mask, these are all high-quality replicas that cover your entire head and feature screen-accurate designs, making them perfect as a part of a cosplay outfit or merch display.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What time of the day are you at your best? From 5:30 until about 11 in the morning. Everything is downhill after lunch, which is when I turn into Sleepy Spice, hahaha! I don’t know when it happened, but somewhere along the way in the last 10 years, I became a morning person. 2. Things you like in your smoothie? Greek yogurt, vanilla protein powder, raspberries (for fiber!) are my favorites. I also like bananas or apples for sweetness. 3. Something about your current makeup routine that bugs you? Ugh, the concealer I’ve been using from MAC just doesn’t seal well after I use it. Bits and bobs of it end up all over the place. It’s super messy and it bothers me. 4.
