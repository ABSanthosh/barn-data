    "description": "Following its brief network beta in February we now have the final release of Elden Ring Nightreign, giving us a fresh chance to assess the console versions. To cut to the chase, there is both good and bad news for console users. The positive side ultimately comes down to Nightreign's winning gameplay design because, against all the odds, developer FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off works surprisingly well. Barring ongoing issues with network latency during its first week - causing lag on NPC reactions after a strike at points - this is a well crafted, Fortnite-inspired twist on Elden Ring. The combat mechanics are instantly familiar, and there's plenty of strategic depth as you spend a one hour session levelling up in anticipation of a Night Lord boss. It compels repeat attempts, and crucially, rewards a trio of players to co-ordinate their character builds towards that final point. Read more",

There are three Fortnite Edition models to choose from, each of which is on sale for $48 (was $60). The Peely- and Raven-themed models launched in April and come with matching charging docks and in-game items. The other controller is the Fortnite Festival Edition, which launched back in December and comes with a 5-button fret attachment for Fortnite's Guitar Hero-inspired game mode. All three models have pro-style features, including Hall Effect sticks and triggers, remappable back buttons, swappable stick caps, and adjustable settings.

Since the Neo S connects via Bluetooth, you should be able to use them wirelessly on Nintendo Switch 2 as well. It is worth noting, however, that the Fortnite-themed versions of the Neo S have the Xbox face button layout, whereas other editions, such as the transparent model that's discounted to $42.50 (was $50), match Nintendo's labeling with X on top, A on the right, B on bottom, and Y on the left.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Luckily, a new volume of the official Elden Ring manga, The Road to the Erdtree Vol. 5, recently launched and is discounted to just $10.30 for a limited time. If you're already caught up, you can also preorder Volume 6 (releases July 22) and Volume 7 (releases October 28) for $13 apiece at Amazon--or, if you're new to the series and looking to start from the beginning, you can also grab the first four volumes, all of which are discounted at Amazon. Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree manga While Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree is set in the same dark fantasy world and features many of the same characters as the video game, it's also a more humorous take on the epic adventure, following a lone Tarnished named Aseo on a quest to become Elden Lord.Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree:Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree, Vol. 1 -- $11.70 ($13)Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree, Vol. 2 -- $11.70 ($13)Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree, Vol. 3 -- $10.30 ($13)Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree, Vol. 4 -- $10.30 ($13)Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree, Vol. 5 -- $10.30 ($13)Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree, Vol. 6 -- $13 | Releases July 22Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree, Vol. 7 -- $13 | Releases October 28 See Elden Ring manga at Amazon Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "As I noted on Friday, our staging system in Scalding Pass put us within range of a few systems in Insmother, the region that is the target of the campaign, but that we would likely be moving forward soon.  And, as it turned out, sooner than I thought, though not to one of the systems […]",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What time do you usually wake up in the morning? These days, 6 in the morning. Ideally my day would start off at 5:30, though. 2. How organized is your purse? It’s on the verge of haphazard, always, LOL! I mean, I can find the usual things I absolutely need – my phone, wallet, keys, medication, lipgloss. But do I find those things in an efficient manner? No. 3. If you could make one rule that everyone around you had to follow, what would it be? Make your deadlines. I can’t stand it when people are casual about due dates! 4. How do you feel about wearing makeup when it’s hot? I’ll do it, but I don’t like to do too many layers. I’m happy with cream[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 881 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Tabs always said that in kitty modeling, the best defense is a good offense. If you just rest on your laurels, sooner or later a hungrier up-and-coming cat (or Australian Shepherd) will take what’s yours, and you won’t be walking the catwalk at feline fashion week anymore. Nope, if you’re lucky, you’ll get a page in the Petco catalog. Every once in a while Tabs went into kitty ninja mode, and instead of just patrolling the neighborhood, he conducted more advanced cat recon… He’d inspect the houses on the circle more closely to look for signs of canine or feline incursion. One day, he picked up a new cat’s scent around an air conditioning filter a couple houses down. He sniffed the area for a long time, gathering intelligence, and then used the data to compile a cat profile. According to Tabs, the new cat was a three-year-old male tabby with green eyes and a crooked tail… Moderate kitty modeling potential. Of course, he was added to the database. 🙂 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict,[Continue reading...] The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 863 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
