It's a crunchy, dicey machine of vibrant world-building that sometimes forgets itself in wandering prose. A compelling universe to sail through, with more habitats and hovels than its predecessor, more stations and stellar gateways.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Pick one: colorful shoes or a colorful sweater? Let’s go with the colorful shoes. Life is too short for boring footwear! 2. Which would you rather never have to deal with again: nosy neighbors, parallel parking, burnt food or washing your makeup brushes? Once, I caught a neighbor going through our trash. So I could do without the nosy neighbors, LOL! 3. Have you ever crimped your hair? Yes, but sadly, I never got to do it in the ‘80s (I was too young and missed all the cool stuff). 4. Who does the grocery shopping in your household? Mostly me, but El Hub will do it if he has extra time and/or if I’m busy with Connor doing extracurriculars. 5. Liquid liner: yes or no?

    "description": "(NOVATO) Today in cat science news! Rosie brought the full force of her four PhDs in science to solve a canine conundrum. The dilemma? Well, she started a dog training service, and she’s been trying to train Marnie, but sadly, it has not gone well. Rosie, being the cat genius she is, figured out that the key to making Marnie more receptive to instruction is to wear her out. To that end, Rosie got to work. From her lab at the Cat Academy of Sciences, she developed a new cutting edge treadmill that automatically adjusts its speed to efficiently tire out a canine jogger. So far, results have been good. Marnie has been jogging on the treadmill for 24 straight hours. At this rate, it looks like she might — might — start to get tired in a few days. 🙂 Hard to say, though. Marnie is on the track team at the University of Derp, so she has pretty incredible endurance.
