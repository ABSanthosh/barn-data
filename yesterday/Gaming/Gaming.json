    "description": "Lego Star Wars: AT-ST Ultimate Collector Series (1,513 Pieces) $200 | Releases August 1 Preorder at Amazon The next Ultimate Collector Series set in Lego's Star Wars collection focuses on one of the most beloved transport vehicles from the original trilogy: the AT-ST Walker. Slated to launch August 1, the 1,513-piece AT-ST model kit for adults is the cheapest member of the exclusive UCS club that you can find in stores today. You can preorder the Lego Star Wars: AT-ST Ultimate Collector Series set for $200 at Amazon. Lego Star Wars: AT-ST Ultimate Collector Series (1,513 Pieces) $200 | Releases August 1 The All Terrain Scout Transport, better known as AT-ST, has been part of the Star Wars movie universe since The Empire Strikes Back. The 1,513-piece building set creates a detailed replica that looks quite similar to the AT-ST from Return of the Jedi.The completed build measures 14.5 x 8.5 x 8.5 inches and has multiple interactive components, including an openable top hatch covering the cockpit, a rotating head, viewport shutters, and adjustable laser cannons. The AT-ST is well-known for its unique gait that resembles a chicken. Lego's AT-ST has articulated legs, so you can move it around like a real chicken walker.As an Ultimate Collector Series set, this AT-ST has a myriad of small details that you won't find on transport walkers in Lego's playsets. The spacious two-person cockpit has finer details that make it more aligned with its appearance in the movies. UCS builds also take a more thoughtful approach when it comes to layering and visible studs, and the promotional images reflect that here. The build process is generally more complex with an Ultimate Collector Series set, so the AT-ST and UCS sets are recommended for experienced builders ages 18 and up.Like all UCS Star Wars builds and other large-scale display models, the AT-ST comes with an information plaque and a minifigure. Appropriately, the minifigure for this kit is an AT-ST Driver. Preorder at Amazon Lego Star Wars: AT-ST UCS (2025) Continue Reading at GameSpot",

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Do you have a favorite vegetable? Yes! Carrots, for sure. The fact that you can turn them into a cake is a big deal! I mean, come on, have you ever heard of a broccoli cake? Or an okra cake? Yeah, I didn’t think so, LOL! I also love that you can put them in salads, roast them or just eat them plain with a variety of different dips. 2. A song that’s been stuck in your head lately? “Top of the World” by The Carpenters has been on repeat in my car. 3. Something you’ve been avoiding lately? Social media and the news cycle in general. 4. Lip masks: yes or no? Yes, but only if we’re talking Laneige. 5.

In fact, she insists on waking me up at the crack of dawn so that she can go running with me, and by running I mean sprinting circles around me as I shuffle along… I believe she thinks that I am her sheep. 🐑 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 865 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
