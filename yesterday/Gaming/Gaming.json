    "description": "Fields of Mistria's Caldarus romance is here at last, though getting the dragon guardian's affection takes rather a lot of work. His human form is tied to a new quest that requires several rare and valuable items, and you need to spend a lot of time in the mines before you can start it. Our Fields of Mistria Caldarus guide explains how to unlock Caldarus for romance and what his preferred gifts are.How to romance Caldarus in Fields of MistriaGood thing there's a local witch who specializes in breaking seals.Caldarus' human form and subsequent arrival on the stage of potential romance is tied to a lengthy quest introduced in Fields of Mistria's second major update, Breaking the Fire Seal. Getting to the point where you can begin the quest requires a fair bit of spelunking in the mines, as the tablet and the Fire Seal itself are buried deep in the mines, at level 60. You'll also need several emeralds, sapphires, and rubies during the quest itself, so make sure to set some aside asOnce you acquire the tablet, speak to Juniper at the bathhouse to start the quest. Once you break the seal, Caldarus will appear, adopt his human form, and expend all his energy rescuing you from the calamity that ensued after the seal broke. He's, understandably, a bit tired after that and retreats to his home in the Deep Woods to recover--but not before giving you a new spell, Dragon's Breath.Continue Reading at GameSpot",
