    "description": "The strangely lengthy Fortnite OG Season 3 has finally come to an end--it was three weeks longer than the first two!--and now it's finally time for the one we've all been waiting for. Season 4 was a landmark for Fortnite, and these days it's widely considered to be the season where Fortnite found its groove. And now we get to go back.Naturally, the new season of OG comes with a new OG Pass. Like the previous OG Passes, this one includes three skins inspired by Fortnite's history, along with a full set of cosmetics and multiple style options for each of them. And, yes, this pass does include a remix of a certain beloved pass skin from that season: The Visitor.The Visitor was essentially the character who instigated Fortnite's original storyline when he rode in on the meteor in order to investigate the weird black hole in the middle of the island. Having such an important place in Fortnite lore has made the Visitor skin, which was available exclusively on the Season 4 battle pass, a particularly flex-worthy OG skin over time.The other two skins are a new remix of Teknique, from the original Season 4 battle pass, who really looks suspiciously like a new version of Aura; and a version of Omega, also from the battle pass, in the style of Oblivion. For a closer look at each of the skins, as well as every single other item in the Season 4 OG Pass, all you have to do is scroll down. Fortnite OG Season 4 ends on August 8.Beyond OG, Fortnite had another big launch today with the superhero-themed Chapter 6 Season 3. We've got all the details here.",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What time do you usually wake up in the morning? These days, 6 in the morning. Ideally my day would start off at 5:30, though. 2. How organized is your purse? It’s on the verge of haphazard, always, LOL! I mean, I can find the usual things I absolutely need – my phone, wallet, keys, medication, lipgloss. But do I find those things in an efficient manner? No. 3. If you could make one rule that everyone around you had to follow, what would it be? Make your deadlines. I can’t stand it when people are casual about due dates! 4. How do you feel about wearing makeup when it’s hot? I’ll do it, but I don’t like to do too many layers. I’m happy with cream[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 881 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Tabs always said that in kitty modeling, the best defense is a good offense. If you just rest on your laurels, sooner or later a hungrier up-and-coming cat (or Australian Shepherd) will take what’s yours, and you won’t be walking the catwalk at feline fashion week anymore. Nope, if you’re lucky, you’ll get a page in the Petco catalog. Every once in a while Tabs went into kitty ninja mode, and instead of just patrolling the neighborhood, he conducted more advanced cat recon… He’d inspect the houses on the circle more closely to look for signs of canine or feline incursion. One day, he picked up a new cat’s scent around an air conditioning filter a couple houses down. He sniffed the area for a long time, gathering intelligence, and then used the data to compile a cat profile. According to Tabs, the new cat was a three-year-old male tabby with green eyes and a crooked tail… Moderate kitty modeling potential. Of course, he was added to the database. 🙂 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict,[Continue reading...] The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 863 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
