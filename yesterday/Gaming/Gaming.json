    "description": "It's been nearly five years since Mojang, the studio behind Minecraft, added RTX support. The move allowed creators, modders, and the like to turn the block worlds they build into visually stunning landscapes. However, in that time, there has seemingly been little forward momentum in terms of officially created visual improvements. Now, though, Mojang has taken things one step further with the newly announced Vibrant Visuals update.GameSpot recently visited Mojang's Sweden-based studio to test the new update, and it's not hyperbole to say Vibrant Visuals is a game-changer for the 14-year-old title. And it's not just for those with PCs that support ray tracing. When Vibrant Visuals launches for Minecraft Bedrock, it'll also be available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and some iOS and Android devices. And for those that play Java Edition, Vibrant Visuals is also in the works for that platform.It's a change that's been in the pipeline for years. As Minecraft executive producer Ingela Garneji explained to a small group of press, \"It's been a bumpy road. We've been iterating and learning, failing and then learning fast, and improving things together with the community, actually.\"Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "While each of Minecraft's twice-annual game drops have brought new mobs, the second drop of 2025's is a cut above the rest. Meet the happy ghast. Finally, a ghast that doesn't want you dead.That's right: While ghasts are known for spitting fireballs at you, carving paths of destruction across the Nether, this new variant just wants to be your friend. The happy ghast comes in a few forms, the evolution of which are up to the player to set in motion.The most interesting aspect of the happy ghast is that it allows players to fly around the overworld. If you've been playing Minecraft long enough and have been to The End, that might not sound all too valuable while you whip around the map with your elytra wings. However, for newer players, the process of getting a happy ghast begins in the Nether--a location you visit long before you venture into The End. That brings flight to users much earlier in the game. The added bonus is that up to four people can travel on a single happy ghast, making group adventures easier.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What eye makeup products have been on repeat with you lately? Maybelline Lash Sensational Sky High Mascara (eh, it’s just OK), Stila Liquid Liner Micro Tip (it’s pretty good) and good ol’ Anastasia Brow Pencil. 2. How good are you about finding clothes that fit you well? I used to be OK at it, but now, I don’t really enjoy in-person shopping as much as I used to, so I don’t spend the time that one really needs to find the things that fit great. There’s always something a little off with my clothes and I just kinda live with it. Blergh! On the bright side, at least my outfit is always ironed and somewhat matching. 3. How good are you about resisting impulse purchases? Pretty good![Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 871 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Tabs was a natural born optimist. He always saw the up side to everything, sought out the silver linings and took advantage of every opportunity to spread hope and joy. That might be why he liked holidays so much — because they were an opportunity to play Santa “Claws,” so to speak, and spread good tidings to everyone. Perhaps for the obvious reasons, St. Patrick’s Day was a fave. Obviously, with those gorgeous green eyes, he loved the color scheme. ☘️ And then, of course, the gold… He was also a big fan of that. 😊 Rosie has her own reasons for celebrating St. Paddy’s Day. For starter’s, alchemy… In fact, she did her PhD dissertation in turning lead into gold through targeted meows in the ultra-low frequency range, the so-called “smoker’s meow” spectrum. Marnie, however, did not get the memo regarding St. Patrick’s Day this year. Or rather, she did get the memo, but she didn’t read it.
