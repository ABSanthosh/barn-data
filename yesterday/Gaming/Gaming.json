    "description": "Digital Extremes is hosting its 10th TennoCon this weekend to celebrate 12 years of Warframe and the beginnings of its new IP, Soulframe. Ahead of the celebration, we saw a new gameplay demo of Soulframe presented by Digital Extremes CEO Steve Sinclair, Soulframe creative director Geoff Crookes, and senior community manager Sarah Asselin, and spoke with two members of the Soulframe dev team.Soulframe narrative designer Sydney Hills and lead designer Scott McGregor answered our questions about the game's new skill system; its French-speaking witch, Verminia; the singing bear, Bromius; and more.Soulframe is a free-to-play, open-world multiplayer RPG with a fantasy setting that sits in contrast to Warframe's sci-fi world. It’s much more rooted in a connection to nature, encouraging exploration of Midrath’s mystical wilderness. Instead of guns and lasers, think bows and magic.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The real test of Shadow Labyrinth lies in getting through the Great Tree, also known as the Sky-High Tree. This is one of the first objectives that involves a substantial amount of traversal. If you're used to playing Metroidvanias, you might know what to expect. There are plenty of paths that lead to secondary rooms, and even optional areas. While they're useful to gather resources, it can be easy to get lost. Moreover, the game's map can be quite obtuse, and you might miss doors and ledges that pertain to the main objective.If you're finding it difficult to get through the Sky-high Tree areas, don't fret. Below is a step-by-step walkthrough detailing how to get through the Great Tree in Shadow Labyrinth, which culminates in a boss fight that rewards you with a key ability to continue moving forward.How to get through the Great Tree in Shadow LabyrinthYou'll get access to the Great Tree area after defeating Orange G-HOST: Garbage Talos and obtaining the GAIA form thanks to the G-Phase Shift. Confusing nouns aside, the starting segments of the area are fairly linear. The key here is learning enemy patterns, as you'll encounter quite a few new foes while heading east.Continue Reading at GameSpot",
