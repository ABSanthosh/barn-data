    "description": "Mario Kart World is being positioned as the Switch 2's biggest selling-point, and it's easy to see why. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe stayed atop the Nintendo Switch sales charts undefeated for years, and still stands as the top-selling game on Switch and in the Mario Kart series. Nintendo is clearly trying to capture that lightning in a bottle again for its follow-up console, with a new Mario Kart ready to speed off the starting block alongside the system. And with that premium offering comes a premium price: $80, a price tag that leapfrogs over the somewhat expected $70 price for next-gen games.When Nintendo took the wraps off of Mario Kart World as part of its Switch 2 presentation, the price was a major point of conversation. And more specifically: What made this game demand such a high asking price? When asked, Nintendo's answer was essentially that the proof was in the pudding--that once we saw all it had to offer, the reason behind the increased price would become apparent.\"We'll look at varying prices and things like that for software based off of just how robust the experience is,\" Nintendo's Bill Trinen told us in an interview in early April. \"People will get to learn more about that game. And I think that as they start to learn more about that game, they're going to be pretty excited about the content that's offered there.\"Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Why settle for one kind of horror story when you can explore them all? That's the TLDR behind Video Ghastlies, an upcoming horror game that sees players pulled into many different eras of horror movie history, from 1930s gothic horror and Carpenteresque body horror to Giallo slashers and even modern styles like found footage. The game doesn't have a release date just yet, but it'll debut on PC. Video Ghastlies is set in 1990s Scotland, casting players as the sibling of a missing brother. To find him, you'll explore illegal VHS tapes, with each one pulling you into a different horror story. In between, your apartment acts as a safe haven where you can put clues together and try to solve a multilayered mystery. The game doesn't intend to be a defenseless horror game akin to Amnesia or Outlast. Instead, you'll be equipped with weapons befitting of each era and genre you're pulled into, with puzzles to slow you down and enemies staring back at you.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Group chats: love ‘em or leave ‘em? It depends on the group, hahaha! I mostly love ‘em, and for those chats that I wanna leave (but can’t for whatever reason), well, that’s when the mute button comes in handy. 2. Full, medium or sheer? Hmm. For things like face makeup, then medium or sheer, although to be honest medium feels like full coverage for me these days! When it comes to, like, nail polish, though? Opaque all the way. I’ve got no time for sheer nail polish these days. Oh, and does this apply to perfume, too? Because if we’re talking about scents, I’ve been more into medium and sheer scents lately. 3. Did you pick up anything during the Sephora sale? Not this time, no.

    "description": "Sure, Tabs was a great boss, brilliant thinker, a total disruptor who dominated everything he ever tried, but let’s be real… He was a really tough employer. He was so demanding! “Meow!” he’d say, or “Mrrow!” A lot of the time, his directives had to do with treats (of course), or petting — specifically, deep-tissue kitty massage. I did my best, but I was only human, which yeah, was a bit of liability. That’s why Tabs spent years developing the perfect robotic assistant. We even released a couple pretty good ones. In fact, our Tabby Dynamics subdivision was the first to bring a bipedal humanoid cat assistant to market. When Rosie took over as CFO, I thought she’d be different. She had a bit of a softer streak than Tabs, but we quickly realized that she was also pretty demanding. She isn’t as tough as Tabs was, but I think it’s fair to say that one of our pet assistants has trouble with bananas. That’s one way to describe it… She may not be the[Continue reading...] The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 857 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
