    "description": "See: Complete Series (Blu-ray) $59.32 (was $100) | Releases July 8 Preorder at Amazon Apple TV+ is home to several excellent series, but you don't need to subscribe to the service to watch them all. Select Apple TV+ shows have been released on Blu-ray, including fan favorites like Ted Lasso and Severance. The next Apple TV+ series coming to Blu-ray is the sci-fi saga, See, which launches on July 8. Preorders for See: The Complete Series Blu-ray are discounted to just $59.32 at Amazon (down from $100). See: Complete Series (Blu-ray) $59.32 (was $100) | Releases July 8 Starring Jason Momoa, the award-winning sci-fi thriller is set in the post-apocalyptic aftermath of an epidemic that leaves Earth's population blind--until a set of twins are born with the ability to see. This 6-disc Blu-ray includes all 24 episodes across See’s three seasons. No special features are listed for this release. Preorder at Amazon Since this bundle doesn’t release until July 8, consider biding your time with another discounted Blu-ray. Amazon is offering nice price cuts on all sorts of films and TV series, including those starring Momoa and other intriguing sci-fi series. There’s also a handful of different preorder options for A Minecraft Movie--including a Limited Edition Steelbook and Collector’s Crafting Table Edition that’s exclusive to Walmart. It arrives a few weeks before See: Complete Series (Blu-ray), and it’s a fun way to see Momoa in a completely different role.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Do you care about Labubus? Nah, I just don’t get the hype. 2. What’s your favorite summer dessert? Hmm, all of them? If pressed to pick one, then ice cream. 3. Do you have plans for the Fourth of July yet? Connor will be dancing with her dance team in the town parade, so that’s our main event during the day. We’ll probably do a barbeque at home after the parade. Where we live doesn’t allow fireworks, so we may or may not go looking for a fireworks display. We’ll see how ambitious we’re feeling! 4. How do you feel about maxi dresses?

    "description": "Heya, friend! Happy late Father’s Day to ya! Hope you had a great one. Except for a brief drive out to visit the fam in the East Bay, we stayed around the house. But it was fun. Lots of high-intensity lounging, TV watching and chillaxin’… Rosie, purr usual, spent the day working on her science experiments. That reminds me… Tabs wasn’t particularly interested in science or genetics like Rosie is, but he was interested in acting as a father figure to at-risk kittens and a mentor to up-and-coming kitty supermodels. Despite his busy schedule, he always made time for the kittens in his foundation. He would read to them, do homework with them, teach them how to strut and strike poses on the catwalk — all the basic life skills. Rosie Rosie’s view of Father’s Day is a little different.
