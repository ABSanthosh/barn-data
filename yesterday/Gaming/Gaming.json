Normally $45, the 784-piece Christmas Tree set is on sale for only $31 (was $45). And if you want Santa to place some presents under the tree, Lego Santa's Sleigh is discounted to $28 (was $40). Amazon also has the 200-plus piece Nutcracker Lego set for just $7.79 (was $13), too.Lego Christmas Tree (784 pieces) -- $31 ($45)Lego Santa's Sleigh (343 pieces) -- $28 ($40)Lego Nutcracker (208 pieces) -- $7.79 ($13)Lego Gingerbread Ornaments (190 pieces) -- $9.09 ($13)These are all seasonal exclusives, so they won't be available to purchase for much longer, regardless of when the deals expire. Lego Christmas Tree 2-in-1 (784 Pieces) $31 (was $45) After selling out during Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, the Lego Christmas Tree deal is back in stock at Amazon, Target, and Walmart for only $31.Lego includes instructions for three different tree sizes: 11 inches, 9 inches, and 6 inches. Each tree has subtle design differences, so it's a fun Lego model to take apart and rebuild. If you build the largest tree, you'll use most of the 784 pieces. But if you opt for the medium or smallest trees, there are enough pieces to build, decorate, and display two Lego Christmas trees. See at Amazon See at Target See at Walmart Lego Santa's Sleigh (343 Pieces) $28 (was $40) Lego's adorable Santa's Sleigh building set is a 343-piece build featuring a red sleigh filled with toys, a Santa minifigure, four reindeer figures with removable saddles, eight buildable gift boxes, his Naughty or Nice List, and a variety of little gifts like a teddy bear and guitar for Santa to place under the Lego Christmas Tree--but only if you're on the Nice List, of course. It also comes with carrot and pretzel accessories to feed the reindeer.When completed, this jolly Lego set measures at roughly 10 inches from the not-red-nosed reindeer's nose to the back of Santa's Sleigh. It's a fun little build for kids, but it also makes for a neat holiday decoration on your mantel. See at Amazon See at Target Lego Nutcracker (208 pieces) $7.79 (was $13) The Lego Nutcracker is a 208-piece buildable figure with posable arms and a mouth that can be opened and shut with a lever. No, this Nutcracker will not actually crack almonds or walnuts, but you can pretend it's talking. It comes with a set of eyelashes and eyes, so the Nutcracker can either smile merrily with eyes closed or glare at you. Alternatively, you could also use one of each so the Nutcracker is winking at you. See at Amazon See at Target Lego Gingerbread Ornaments (190 Pieces) - Makes Three Ornaments $9.09 (was $13) Instead of decorating holiday cookies this year, you can build cute, but 100% inedible, Lego Gingerbread Ornaments. Each pack comes with enough pieces to build and decorate three ornaments for your Christmas Tree. Gingerbread Ornaments are currently out of stock at Amazon, and Target's price has increased from $7.79 to $9.09. See at Target See at Amazon See at Lego Store",

You know, MAC Club eyeshadow? Of course you do. It’s a classic. Last week, out of nowhere, I thought to myself, “I really need to wear Club.” It’s been years since I’ve wanted to deal with complicated eye makeup, but I got the urge, so I went with it. My makeup collection is pretty barren compared to the thick of MBB’s beauty blogging days, but I’ve held on to this ancient Monster’s Bride palette from —I don’t even wanna say the year. LOL! I’ve always loved the shadows, especially Club. I took a little bit of Club, popped it on my lids and smoothed out the edges with a fluffy brush dipped in face powder.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. A habit that changed your life? Getting up early. For most of my life I was a night owl, and when I had Connor that all changed. When she was an infant, I started waking up at the crack of dawn to sneak in work before she woke up in the morning. The habit ended up sticking, and now I’m an early bird. 2. Fruit or cupcakes? As much as I love a small cake smothered in frosting, I’m gonna have to go with fruit. 3. Are you doing any advent calendars this year? At Trader Joe’s a couple weeks ago, I picked up a few for the “kids” – Connor, Rosie and Marnie. Ha ha ha! 4. Something on your Christmas list?

    "description": "Dragon Age: The Veilguard won't receive any major story DLC. It also ends pretty decisively, save for a few hints about the future of Thedas in a secret post-credits scene. How final is that air of finality? Is Dragon Age going back on the shelf for the forseeable? Fear not, say game director Corinne Busche and series creative director John Epler, for the universe of Dragon Age has many yarns yet to spin. The next game won't necessarily be an action game with RPG trappings, either, for much like Final Fantasy, Dragon Age exists in a state of continual \"reinvention\". Read more",

    "description": "Astrometica is Subnautica in space and to developer BeryMery's credit, the game makes zero effort to hide this. It's right there in the dog Latin of the title. It's got Subnautica's premise of being a shipwreck survivor starting afresh from an escape capsule, piecing together the backstory signal by signal, database entry by database entry.
