    "description": "Earlier this month, A24 announced that it will bring Elden Ring to the big screen as a live-action movie. Now, the first actor circling a role in the film is reportedly Kit Connor, who recently had a leading part in A24's Warfare.As reported by Deadline, Connor has not closed his deal with A24 and it's unclear how far the negotiations have progressed. If the contract is agreed upon, Connor will reunite with his Warfare director Alex Garland, who is writing and directing Elden Ring. The report notes that scheduling the film to accommodate Connor and Garland may be a challenge, but both of them \"want this to happen.\"The closest thing that Connor has had to a video game movie in the past is a small part in Ready Player One. He has since gone on to larger roles in Rocketman, The Wild Robot, His Dark Materials, and the Netflx original series Heartstopper. Garland established himself as an author before moving to screenwriting with 28 Days Later, Sunshine, and Dredd. He later broke out a director with Ex Machina, Annihilation, and Civil War.Continue Reading at GameSpot",
