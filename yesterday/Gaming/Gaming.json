SlayPtation have been bringing their studios' multiplayer and live-service games to PC at release for a while now, it making sense with the likes of Helldivers 2 and, er, Concord, to try and ensure the maximum potential player base possible right out of the gate. On the other hand, for single player stuff like God of War Ragnarok and Ghost of Tsushima they've been content to wait a year to bring over to the other video game boxes. Read more",

    "description": "My personal pick of this week’s Steam Next Fest demos is Jump Ship, which you might already know as that co-operative, 'Left 4 Dead meets FTL meets Sea of Thieves' space crew shooter previously known as Hyperspace. Godspeed, Captain Farts. All our previous looks at Jump Ship, including Edwin’s GDC 2024 preview, have seen it in varying states of unreadiness, with more missing parts than the game’s own spaceship after one of its many 1 vs. Loads dogfights. This public demo, however, looks and feels fairly polished, allowing it to serve as a rather moreish showcase of its mission loops. Which, at least for me and a couple of crewmates, seem to involve a lot of swishing around on grappling hooks while our vessel melts from within. Read more",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Loose or fitted t-shirts? Generally, I like my tees slightly loose-y goose-y if I’m wearing them with jeans or shorts. If I’m layering with a sweater or a sweatshirt on top, then fitted. 2. What’s the oldest thing in your makeup bag right now? Hmm, the brushes? Oh, and I’m almost embarrassed to say this out loud, but I have an ancient Nordstrom Naturals MAC palette that I bust out every so often. 3. How’s your June going so far? It’s been very, very busy with end-of-the-year activities, dance things and whatnot. Things will kinda slow down after June 30, which I’m looking forward to. 4. How do you feel about walking around in sandals or flip flops without your toenails painted? I like my toe nails[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 882 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

These days, 6 in the morning. Ideally my day would start off at 5:30, though. 2. How organized is your purse? It’s on the verge of haphazard, always, LOL! I mean, I can find the usual things I absolutely need – my phone, wallet, keys, medication, lipgloss. But do I find those things in an efficient manner? No. 3. If you could make one rule that everyone around you had to follow, what would it be? Make your deadlines. I can’t stand it when people are casual about due dates! 4. How do you feel about wearing makeup when it’s hot? I’ll do it, but I don’t like to do too many layers.
