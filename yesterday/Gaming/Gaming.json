    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Shrimp or crab? Crab, but it can’t be imitation, and it has to be fresh. 2. Yoga or pilates? Both are equally as challenging for this very out-of-shape lady at the moment. LOL! (Been a rough 12 months.) I’ll pick yoga; I could use a good stretch. 3. Something that makes you feel sentimental? When my phone brings up baby photos of Connor or old photos of Tabs before he got sick. My heart swells up every single time. 4. What book are you reading at the moment? Nothing at the moment, boo. I need a good one. Got anything to suggest? I would like something not too heavy or scary. 5. Something you wish you said no to sooner? I wish I would’ve said no to[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 868 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

In fact, he won the Kitty Bowl a record eight times, making him more accomplished than even Tom Brady. Yes, Tabs was quite the cat athlete. Today’s game starts in a few minutes, and while Tabs is no longer here to watch the game with me, I’m sure he’ll be watching from up above. This happens to also be the last Sunday before Valentine’s. Marnie and Rosie are both more interested in that aspect of the day than the football. I can appreciate that. 🙂 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S.
