    "description": "The Crossroads is a large region that you'll visit often in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Part of the realm known as the Fade, it holds many secrets. One of these concerns a thrice-locked gate, and the challenges it entails are sure to test your mettle. Here's our guide on how to complete The Heart of Corruption in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.Dragon Age: The Veilguard Heart of Corruption guideThe Heart of Corruption in Dragon Age: The Veilguard is an over-arcing quest. This is due to the following:The quest itself appears in your journal once you spot the thrice-locked door. It can be found on Beacon Island, the first area upon entering the Crossroads. From the Lighthouse eluvian, just go immediately to your right to see it.The seals can only be removed by obtaining three Revenant Essences. These items come from deadly, high-level bosses found in specific areas of the Crossroads.However, you won't be able to enter these areas normally. Instead, you must first eliminate a Darkspawn Champion in another region.Tracking The Heart of Corruption quest makes markers appear on your map, and these show you the general location of the revenant bosses. You could then track the side quest that appears to look for the champion enemy in a different region.In any case, we hope you're well-prepared prior to tackling these tasks. We suggest collecting a few unique items and picking the best skills/specializations. Much later in the campaign, you should also unlock Hero of the Veilguard perks for your companions to bolster their capabilities. Heart of Corruption Part 1A: The Gate of Lost AgesOnce you've arrived at the Converged City--i.e. the southern island in the Crossroads--you'll notice a barred doorway with only one seal. A quest will then appear in your journal, and it's called The Gate of Lost Ages.Your target is a champion called. This beast can be found in Dock Town, in an area to the east called Andraste's Watch. Go past the Fen'harel Statue and head down the pit. Take out all the demons and undead that will spawn once you're down below, so they don't become an annoyance during the battle.Once you're done, destroy the blight pod to free Quyn the Sparkwielder, a level 20 demon. Kill it and pick up the orb that it drops. Heart of Corruption Part 1B: Betrayal of FelassanNow that you have the Champion's Essence, use it on the doorway in the Converged City. This unlocks a path that takes you to an underground section of the island. There, you'll face a level 32 boss named Betrayal of Felassan. If you've been tackling the Regrets of the Dread Wolf quest, then you've likely seen this fella's elven form a few times.In any case, Betrayal of Felassan periodically summons additional enemy mobs, and it also creates a protective barrier that you need to destroy. Once the boss has been defeated, you'll receive your first Revenant Essence.For your efforts, you'll receive The Burden, a unique amulet that has the following effects: +20% damage when at low health; low health status triggers earlier; your health cannot go above 70%.That does for our Dragon Age: The Veilguard Heart of Corruption guide. We'll continue updating this article once we've eliminated the other targets, so stay tuned.The lands of Thedas are under threat from formidable foes, including some menacing elven gods, and it's up to Rook and their allies to save the day.

    "description": "Dragon Age: The Veilguard has realms where people used to worship divine beings. They've left behind traces of the past, which still hold power to this day. Some, such as the elven statues that dot regions, even improve your chances of survival. Here's our guide on where to find all Evanuris Altars in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.All Evanuris Altars in Dragon Age: The VeilguardThe Dragon Age: The Veilguard Evanuris Altars have humanoid or elf-like features. When you stumble upon these structures, be sure to interact with them. Doing so causes four glistening disks to appear. Destroying them with your ranged attacks grants a permanent +100 health boost. If you're having trouble locating them, take a look at the wispy trails of light to see their general direction.Note: Aside from Evanuris Altars, there are also large wolf-like statues that grant a free skill point. You can learn more about these in our Fen'harel Altars guide. Arlathan Forest #1Found at the Riverside Ruins while you're doing the Spirits of the Dalish companion quest for Bellara. Arlathan Forest #2Similar to the above, you'll find this statue while doing Bellara's Spirits of the Dalish quest. Once you reach the Shadowy Grove, you'll see this structure in a small wooded nook. Arlathan Forest #3From the Ancient Aqueduct beacon, head outside and you'll see a ledge next to a tower. This Dragon Age: The Veilguard Evanuris Statue is right beside the tower itself. Arlathan Forest #4Follow the trail that leads further northeast until you arrive at an area called the Tainted Woods. The statue is in the middle of the ruins of a small fort.That does it for our guide on where to find Evanuris Altars in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. We'll continue updating this article in the coming days, so stay tuned.The lands of Thedas are under threat from formidable foes, including some menacing elven gods, and it's up to Rook and their allies to save the day.

    "description": "Part of the fun of Dragon Age's fantasy is that it's inconsistent - or at least, inconsistent by the standards of fantasy RPGs, which often break down into a million neatly organised and interlocking codex entries. It all rides on who you speak to. The humans believe one thing about the origins and workings of Thedas, the elves another, the qunari something else entirely. These differences are the basis for many factional disagreements and thus, many core series plot developments. According to former lead writer David Gaider, however, there's an \"uber-plot\" behind it all that may one day be resolved and bring the series to a close, assuming BioWare continue to refer to his original (and closely guarded) narrative documents.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Last Halloween costume you wore? Hmm, a couple years ago I was a panda! It was a low-effort panda though. LOL! 2. Best and worst Halloween candy? I used to love Snickers, but now I find them too sweet, so please give me all the Ghrirardelli Caramel Squares. As for the worst ones, I automatically toss the rolls of Smarties and anything licorice related. Blech! 3. Pick your Halloween nail color – orange or black? Black with a high shine top coat please. 4. Vampires or werewolves? I’d rather hang out with the werewolves. 5. Scariest Halloween movie? “The Shining” still freaks me out! Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S. Here are the questions to copy/paste with your answers in a comment. Talk to ya soon.[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 854 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "No one threw a Halloween shindig like Tabs — fancy cat costumes, spooky snacks, special appearances from top-tier talent, including Tabs. In fact, Heidi Klum stole the idea for her spooky soirees from him. Here’s a look back at a typical Halloween 🎃 and all the prep Tabs usually did. My Darlings, There’s an old saying in the plus-size kitty modeling world: “Go big or go home,” and I take that phrase to heart when it comes to hosting parties. I want my guests to be talking about them for years to come. Being a famous feline supermodel, I’ve hosted many Halloween shindigs in my time, and I have almost a decade of party-planning experience. In that vein, here are the four essential components of a successful feline Halloween party. 1. Invitations First things first — the invitations. In the digital age, e-vites and group invites via Facebook are acceptable; however, I’m a little old fashioned. I prefer paper invitations. Do what I do, and ask your assistant to design you a custom invite.
