This is the best deal yet for the first--and priciest--figure in PlayStation's new line of collectibles by Spin Master. The PlayStation Shapes Collection has grown to include six characters across four PlayStation Studios franchises. Amazon also has limited-time deals on Atreus from God of War: Ragnarok and the combo pack featuring Joel and Ellie from The Last of Us.You could put the $15 you're saving on the Aloy action figure toward the official 10-inch plush, which was also designed by Spin Master and is available at Amazon for $20. Unfortunately, the Kratos action figure isn't discounted to pair with Atreus. Fortunately, the newly released 10-inch Kratos plush is on sale for a limited time, dropping the price from $20 down to $16.49. The Kratos plush has a majestic, textured beard.PlayStation Studios 6-inch Action FiguresAloy from Horizon Forbidden West (Deluxe 6\" Figure) -- $35 ($50)Joel \u0026 Ellie from The Last of Us (6\" Figure 2-Pack)-- $45 ($50)Varl from Horizon Forbidden West (6\" Figure) -- $26.72 ($30)Atreus from God of War: Ragnarok (6\" Figure) -- $21 ($30)Kratos from God of War: Ragnarok (6\" Figure) -- $30Jin Sakai Action Figure - Ghost of Tsushima (6\" Figure) -- $30PlayStation Studios 10-inch Collector's PlushiesKratos from God of War Ragnarok (10\" Plush) -- $16.49 ($20)Aloy from Horizon Forbidden West (10\" Plush) -- $20 Horizon Forbidden West - Aloy 6-Inch Deluxe Action Figure $35 (was $50) Aloy is the only \"Deluxe\" figure in the lineup so far. All of the other PlayStation figures have an impressive 30-plus points of articulation, but Aloy has 42. Along with having increased adjustability to strike different poses, the Deluxe figure comes with a lot more accessories than the other solo figures. Aloy has 15 different accessories, including her trusty bow and spear weapons, six swappable faces, and eight hands. The additional hands are necessary to swap weapons. See at Amazon The Last of Us - Joel \u0026 Ellie 6-Inch Action Figures (2-Pack) $45 (was $50) Amazon's deal on The Last of Us figure pack is certainly not as good, but this is the first time it has received a discount. Plus, to be fair, this released on November 1, whereas the Aloy figure launched back on August 1. It's a bit surprising The Last of Us figure pack is even discounted at all.Joel and Elie each have over 30 points of articulation, and the set comes with a total of 15 accessories. Joel has three different weapons--shotgun, revolver, and machete--and five extra hand pieces. Ellie has four extra hand pieces that allow you to switch between her bow and arrow, pistol, rifle, and switchblade. Both figures come with removable tactical backpacks. See at Amazon God of War: Ragnarok - Kratos 10-Inch Plush \u0026 Atreus Action Figure Kratos - $16.49 (was $20) | Atreus - $21 (was $30) Amazon just recently started carrying the official Kratos and Aloy plushies. Plush Kratos looks awesome. PlayStation says this is a \"collector grade\" plush, with embroidered details such as accurate depictions of his tattoos, scars, and outfit from the game. But obviously the most notable aspect of this plush is the full, textured beard and bushy eyebrows.Meanwhile, the action figure version of Atreus is on sale for $21 (was $30). Boy has 33 points of articulation and five accessories, including his bow and arrow. See Kratos Plush deal See Atreus Figure deal",

    "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gta-online-the-black-box-file-mission-guide-in-agents-of-sabotage/2900-6064/",
    "description": "The Black Box File is one of the main jobs you can take on for Jodi in the Agents of Sabotage update in Grand Theft Auto Online. This job requires you to bring down an IAA plane to recover its black box, which apparently has some juicy secrets on it.To do this, you need to procure a means to hack the plane and an aircraft to bring it down from the sky. Then, you have to submerge underwater to grab the black box once it's been shot down. All of this nets you close to $200k if done correctly.Follow our step-by-step walkthrough of The Black Box File below. Procure the Hacking Device Your first job in The Black Box File is to secure a Hacking Device, which is used to intercept the plane's communications from the air. The Hacking Device is located on a roof in downtown Los Santos, and you can head to its waypoint right after Jodi is done explaining the job from your headquarters at the garment factory.At the waypoint, you have to climb a ladder to get to a roof, where a few enemies are waiting for you. Kill them and open the green box to obtain the Hacking Device. Then, descend back down the ladder and head to LSIA, which is located a short distance away. Once you're at LSIA, go to the control tower marked on your map and take out the red cameras unless you want cops on the scene. Climb up the right ladder on the control tower and keep ascending the ladders until you reach the top. There, you can plant the Hacking Device on an electrical box and parachute/climb down. Head back to the garment factory to accept your next mission in the job. Steal the TulaNext, you'll want to steal a weaponized aircraft for the job. In this case, you need to go a Merryweather barge out in the middle of the ocean where a helicopter called the Tula is being kept. When you reach the waypoint on your map after accepting the mission, you can take either a boat or jetski to the barge.It doesn't really matter which one you take, as there is a Merryweather helicopter, two machine gun boats, and several enemies waiting for you on the barge. Take everyone out and hop in the Tula that's sitting in the middle of the barge.Once inside the chopper, you have to take out six different Merryweather helicopters that attack you. This isn't too difficult, as the enemy choppers can't truly harm you. When the choppers are dealt with, head to LSIA and descend with the Tula to park it in the marked location. Secure Sonar EquipmentThe final mission before the grand finale is the steal some sonar equipment that will be used to locate the black box after the plane has gone down.The sonar equipment is located on a tugboat near the Los Santos docks. Specifically, you can find the right near the dock entrance on the eastern side. You'll find a few enemies to kill on the tugboat but it likely won't take you too long. Once they're handled, go on the tugboat and head to the front of it, where you'll find a storage box that contains the sonar equipment.With the equipment in hand, return to the garment factory and access the computer to start the final job of The Black Box File. Hack Air Traffic Control and find the planeThe first step in the final mission is to head back to LSIA and hack into air traffic control at the control tower you previously visited. All you have to do is press the designated button when near the tower, so no climbing is required. Next, head to the Tula at the nearby terminal and drive it to catch up to the IAA plane that's already in the sky. This will take some time, as the Tula is quite slow and the plane is already quite a ways away from the airport. Hack the plane and search for the Black Box When you catch up to the plane, you have to get right near it in order for the hacking to commence. After you get close enough, bring out the SecuroServ app on your phone and you should see a percentage on the screen. Keep up with the plane as this percentage starts to rise. If the percentage stops going up, you need to re-situate the Tula to be closer to the plane. Once the percentage reaches 100, the plane will be hacked and your next task is to blow out one of its engines. This can be tricky, as the Tula's machine gun is wobbly and inaccurate. However, you only have to shoot one of the four engines to take the plane down. If you manage to do so, the plane will crash and end up in a lake on the ground. Descend with the Tula and hop out once you're close enough to the crash site of the plane. From here, head underwater and use your sonar equipment to find the black box. It's located in the front section of the plane, so you have to go inside the cockpit to find it. This requires a sticky bomb to blow up the cockpit doors. With the black box in hand, rise to the top of the lake and find the nearby dinghy that's been provided for you. Escape the cops and find the buyerYou'll need to man the machine gun turret on the dinghy to get the driver to go. Shoot any cops you see along the way, and eventually, the dinghy will bring you to the buyer's location. If you die during this process, you'll respawn on a jet ski and have to retrieve the black box from wherever you died. From there, simply go to the buyer yourself on the jet ski.Once you reach the buyer, you'll exchange hands and receive payment. You can earn a max of $185k for the job, with bonuses for:Destroying all four plane enginesRecover all plane contents underwaterKill five enemies during the dinghy escape",

    "description": "Creation is an act of kindness. One person sloughs off a piece of themselves, shapes it, wraps it, and sends it out into the world in the hope that it might mean something to someone else. Other people do this for us all the time and mostly we don't even notice. The work is unseen and unremarked upon even as, through repetition, we come to depend upon it. Until, one day, that light that they shine can't be seen. Maybe you left home, or maybe they did, but now it's your turn to perform such acts of kindness. To carry the tradition forward for others - and for yourself. Friends, it's time to play Skeal. Read more",

    "description": "Infamous evolutionary flop Spore, for all its flaws, still had a lot of magic to it. It was fun to design your weird creatures, to watch them try to walk, and - in principle - to turn your humble creations into a spacefaring species. Curiosmos is a very different game, but it has a little of the same appeal. It's a galactic playground in which you smash meteors together to make planets, then tinker with the ecosystems of those planets to make life and watch that life evolve. All while a hungry black hole lingers nearby, eager to consume everything you have created. There's an explanatory video below. Read more",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Where would you rather go on vacation: New Zealand, Alaska, Costa Rica or Switzerland? I’d love to go to all of these places, but right now Switzerland sounds pretty cool. 2. Ponytail or curls? Hmm. I like ponytails because they’re functional, but sometimes they give me a headache, so let’s go with curls. They’d have to be super loose ones, though. And kinda messy! 3. Did you ever have a job where you had to wear a uniform? Kinda. We had very specific guidelines for safety when I worked at the bakery, like close-toed shoes, no nail polish, hair tied back. 4. If you were in school, whom would you likely hang out with: the athletes, the drama crew, the band kids or the honors society?

    "description": "Seasons greetings! Hard to believe we’re in full-on Christmas season time now, isn’t it? Folks getting their tree (we did today!), putting up the Christmas lights (workin’ on it!), other decorations. I was looking back at December posts over the years, and when I came upon this one it made me smile. 🙂 Mt. Saint Tabby? That was SO Tabs. It was a quiet morning on our hill today. Nothing really exciting happened, except for some joggers running by, which made a certain someone’s tail poof up… While Tabs checked out the usual blades of grass, plants and trees, I spent some time thinking about how possessive and jealous Tabs gets now in his older age. And not just with his humans. He’s also like that with his domain outside. I may or may not have received a Post-It last week asking me to write the city about renaming our hill, “Mt. Saint Tabby,” because Tabs doesn’t like the thought of anybody, and by “anybody,” I mean any other cats, chilling on his hill.
