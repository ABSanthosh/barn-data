    "description": "Last month, director and actor Chris Carpenter launched a Kickstarter campaign to bring his vision for a Legend of Zelda fan film to life. Although the campaign was moderately successful and raised approximately $24,000, it also caught the attention of Nintendo itself. Now, the Kickstarter campaign has been suspended and the Zelda fan film is no longer happening.Via Nintendo Life, Dio Traverso--one of the film's producers--confirmed on the Kickstarter page that the project has been shuttered and that no money will be collected from the campaign. He also thanked the film's supporters on behalf of Carpenter and the rest of their collaborators.Carpenter had planned to step into the role of Link opposite A Series of Unfortunate Events' Avi Lake, who was cast as Princess Zelda. The movie was called Lost in Hyrule, and the story was set after Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask in order to bring that chapter of Link's adventures to a close.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "It's been 25 years since Maxis first introduced us to The Sims and began wasting so, so much of our time. EA, not too surprisingly, has taken advantage of this major anniversary to re-release both The Sims and The Sims 2, with all DLC included and the games updated for modern computers. And as you take this dose of nostalgia, you may find yourself looking for some cheats to help you reacquaint yourself with the original classic.We've got you covered. Since this re-release of The Sims 1 is just that--an updated version of the existing game, rather than a remake or remaster--not much has changed about how cheating works in the original Sims title. You don't have to mess with game files or command lines or anything like that. You simply fire up the game, and once you're in it, press ctrl+shft+C to pull up the console where you can enter codes--and then enter a code.These days, in The Sims 4, we've got a metric ton of cheats of all kinds, but The Sims 1 was simpler. While the original game has a pretty massive pile of codes that will do under-the-hood technical stuff, there are only a relatively small number of useful cheats. And at least one of them does something completely different than you'd probably expect. Let's dive in.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Warhorse's medieval muck-o-rama Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 launches today. It's an engrossing RPG, despite developer co-founder Dan Vávra's tendency to throw his weight behind alt-right harassment campaigns. Also, a relatively bug-free one. In the course of my 51 hours as reviewer, I've encountered only a smattering of more significant technical issues. Firstly, some heavy slowdown while roaming Trosky Castle, the centerpiece of the opening Bohemian Paradise region, which I resolved by quitting and reloading. Secondly, a mildly terrifying moment in a dugout when a wounded soldier I was supposed to be treating struck a T-pose, as though afflicted by lightning early onset arthritis. And thirdly a repeated crash bug which I feel warrants its own article given that, together with Deliverance 2's eccentric saving system, it cost me several hours of progress. Read more",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What would you rather do on a rainy day: go to the movies with a friend, cozy up at home with a good book and a cup of tea, or go on an adventurous and fun (and very wet) hike? Right now movies with a friend sounds like it would be fun! Of course we’d have to have all the snacks – popcorn, M\u0026Ms and bubbly water. 2. What game show would you absolutely dominate: Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy or The Price Is Right? I’d have the best chances at The Price Is Right. Can’t say I’d dominate it, though. Hahaha! 3. Do you wear more makeup now or less makeup than you did a year ago? I wear a little less these days, but that’s mostly[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 867 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "It has rained for almost a week! I’m getting kinda over it, but Tabs sure would have loved it. That cat LOVED the rain. His favorite thing about it? Rainbows. 🌈 Mind you, I also like the rain. But Tabs didn’t just like the rain. He loved it! I think what he liked about it was all the movement. My theory is that with his heightened cat senses, he could actually track the falling of individual raindrops. Rosie, however, is not a big fan of rain. In fact, she doesn’t particularly enjoy anything about it. Scratch that — I’m mistaken. There is one thing about rain she agrees with Tabs on. Rainbows are fantastic! 🌈😺 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 849 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
