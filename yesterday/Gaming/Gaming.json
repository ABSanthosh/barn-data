    "description": "Although Ron Gilbert came back to the Monkey Island franchise with Return To Monkey Island in 2022, it's unclear when or if the series will ever get another official sequel. But that hasn't stopped a group of die-hard Monkey Island fans from making their own unofficial game, The Booze of Monkey Island.The new title is descripted as a \"love letter\" to the classic Monkey Island games by small studio Bean Adventure Agency, which created The Booze of Monkey Island. Like the games that came before it, players are put into the role of Guybrush Threepwood in a point-and-click adventure. This isn't a full-length game, but it seems to recapture the flavor of its predecessors. After surviving a shipwreck, Guybrush finds himself back on Booty Island, which was last seen in Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge. Speaking of LeChuck, Guybrush's nemesis has returned to menace him and his partner, Elaine, so Guybrush needs to get off Booty Island as soon as possible. The local bartender agrees to assist Guybrush's attempts to repair his ship, but only if Guybrush can drum up some business at the bar.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "I've spent quite a lot of today trying to figure out why, exactly, some of the monsters in the Monster Hunter Wilds beta looked like bundles of copulating pyramids slathered in crocodile gravy. Nic clued me in on this reddit thread earlier, which cites unnamed Chinese players who've allegedly data-mined the beta's monster models, and learned that they are extremely large, encompassing hundreds of thousands of polygons. If every monster in Monster Hunter Wilds were that fancy all of the time, your computer would become a volcano. As such, the game resorts to loading-on-demand systems to ensure that you only see those gorgeous details when the monsters are close by and, as the case may be, angrily sitting on you. When they're further afield, the flourishes fall away to free up memory and processing power. The popular Redditor explanation for the presence of monsters that look like Henry Moore sculpture is basically that the LOD systems are being forgetful, and neglecting to load the additional polygons at proximity.

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Last show you binged watched? “The Diplomat” season 2 on Netflix with Keri Russell. It’s a little silly but I like how they weave real things that happen in the world into it. 2. Have you started planning for Thanksgiving yet? Girl, no. LOL! I barely made it through the Halloween season, which honestly felt like it was three years long. I know in a few years, when Connor’s older, I’ll miss all the activities. Anyway, for Thanksgiving, we’re invited to a dinner that a friend is hosting, so we’ll probably do that. Or, we’ll just stay at home in our jammies, watch movies and have a crab fest again. So fun! 3. Pick your fall nail color – red, burgundy or dark blue? Ooh, burgundy please![Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 855 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

While that may be true, Harris has figured out how to grow big pumpkins. This year, Rosie isn’t holding back. She’s put a lot of time and scientific work into maximizing her pumpkin yields. She also read a bunch of books on botany and interviewed all the top minds in the field.
