    "description": "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray) $33 at Walmart | $36 at Amazon (was $45) | Releases July 29 Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Walmart Ace Ventura: Pet Detective Collector's Edition (4K Blu-ray) $40 | Releases July 29 Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Walmart If you weren't a regular moviegoer in 1994, then it must have been a confusing year, thanks to everyone around you peppering their speech with \"Alriiiiiiighty then\" catchphrases. Jim Carrey's breakout year at the box office started with Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, and at long last, that comedy classic is releasing on 4K Blu-ray on July 29. The Limited Edition Steelbook version is available to preorder for $33 at Walmart or $36 at Amazon. Amazon has sold out of preorders once already (at full price), but if it remains in stock this time, we'd expect the retailer to match Walmart's price prior to launch. That said, it's also possible that the price-matching will go the other way, and Walmart increases its price to $36. Ace Ventura: Pet Detective Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray) $33 at Walmart | $36 at Amazon (was $45) | Releases July 29 The 4K Blu-ray edition of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective was created using the original 35mm camera negative. It supports Dolby Vision with HDR10 and DTS-HD 5.1 Surround Sound. There aren't any new bonus features, but the audio commentary with director Tom Shadyac is included on both the 4K Blu-ray disc and remastered 1080p Blu-ray disc. The latter should offer better visual and audio quality than the original Blu-ray release since it is based on the 4K transfer. The Blu-ray disc also has the theatrical trailer.The original 1997 laserdisc release of Pet Detective had three episodes of the Ace Ventura animated series, but unfortunately those episodes have never been included with subsequent Blu-ray releases.The steelbook case features original artwork of Ventura's signature hairstyle and a pigeon worth $25,000 resting on Jim Carrey's head. Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Walmart Ace Ventura: Pet Detective Collector's Edition (4K Blu-ray) $40 | Releases July 29 Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is also getting a standard edition 4K Blu-ray release on the same day. Though it's officially called a \"Collector's Edition,\" make no mistake that the collectible version is the aforementioned Steelbook Edition. This edition includes a standard plastic case and cardboard sleeve with one of the promotional images for the theatrical release.At the time of writing on May 21, this edition is actually more expensive than the Limited Edition Steelbook at both retailers. Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Walmart Ace Ventura was one of the biggest comedy films of the mid-1990s, thanks mostly to Jim Carrey's wild performance as the titular pet detective. While the movie does have some content that is very dated when viewed through a modern lens, it's still a laugh riot thanks to the constant flow of one-liners and a solid mystery at its core. A sequel would arrive a few years later and it saw Ventura travel to Africa--much to the relief of several dozen Buddhist monks--but this one hasn't received a 4K Blu-ray release yet. You can find it on Blu-ray, or as part of an Ace Ventura Blu-ray double feature.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Enhanced versions of both open-world Zelda games launch alongside the Switch 2 on June 5. If you're looking forward to playing these two masterful games in 4K at 60fps with HDR, you should check out Amazon's deals on the official hardcover strategy guides. Whether you've played the games already or plan on experiencing them for the first time, these well-designed books are handy reference manuals and beautiful collectibles.With the looming resurgence of both games, it's possible that these two hardcover strategy guides could either sell out or increase in price again. As of May 21, though, you can get Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's Collector's Edition Guide for only $25 (was $45) and Zelda: Breath of the Wild's Expanded Edition Guide for just $19.68 (was $40). Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Collector's Edition Guide (Hardcover) $25 (was $45) The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's Collector's Edition Official Guide is a weighty 496-page hardcover with display-worthy cover art featuring the Corrupt Master Sword.Published by Piggyback and created in collaboration with Nintendo, Tears of the Kingdom's guidebook covers virtually every aspect of the sprawling open-world sequel. Along with an overview and tips for all of the main quests, side missions, shrines, and caves, the book offers comprehensive reference sections for all of the game's enemies, weapons, armor, shields, items, and more.All of the game's key systems, from crafting and cooking to using Zonai devices to build vehicles and other gadgets, are detailed alongside helpful tips and overarching strategies.The included World Atlas map section provides the locations all of the Koroks, Dragon's Tears, and collectibles scattered across mainland Hyrule as well as the Sky and Depths. See at Amazon Zelda: Breath of the Wild Complete Guide - Expanded Edition $19.68 (was $40) The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's Expanded Edition Guide looks great when displayed next to the TOTK hardcover. It also happens to be every bit as comprehensive as Tears of the Kingdom's strategy guide.Piggyback published this updated hardcover edition roughly a year after the game's original launch. The Expanded Edition adds chapters on Breath of the Wild's pair of DLC expansions. In addition to walkthroughs for the DLC, the 512-page hardcover features a concept art gallery showcasing in-progress illustrations and sketches by Nintendo's designers.The guide offers an overview of all main missions and side content, including every shrine. You'll also find solutions to all of the game's many puzzles and an in-depth look at the combat system. Catalogs of enemies, gear, and items let you use this book as a reference manual. The 36-page World Atlas reveals locations of collectibles, including every Korok seed. The book also includes a double-sided map of Hyrule with annotations. See at Amazon Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Guide (Paperback) $18.74 (was $30) Circling back to Tears of the Kingdom, it's worth noting that the paperback edition of the official TOTK guidebook is available for $18.74 (was $30). If you think you'll use the guidebook frequently for reference or want a display piece, the more durable hardcover Collector's Edition is the way to go.Breath of the Wild's paperback edition guidebook is out of print, likely because it launched alongside the game in 2017, so it doesn't include coverage of the Expansion Pass. See at Amazon If you already own Tears of the Kingdom and/or Breath of the Wild for Switch, you will be able to purchase $10 Switch 2 upgrades for each game from the eShop. But if you're a new player or simply want to own physical editions for Nintendo's new platform, check out our preorder guide for the Switch 2 versions of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.

This time, the sadness cloud comes wafting from Nvidia themselves, amid accusations of engineering dodgy RTX 5060 previews and attempting to trade access for greater coverage of its Multi Frame Generation (MFG) capability.

    "description": "The roguelike deckbuilder is a remorseless evil that strives to colonise every dream ever dreamt by the human brain. It is a sparkling, shuffling plague, germinated by Slay The Spire, that threatens to absorb every other mortal pastime, from space travel through poker to carpentry. We must find a way to neutralise the entity before it assimilates us all. But in the words of the oldest proverb: just one more go. Just one more go, before I dissipate raging into that goodnight. Just one more run, before I play all those shortform avant garde releases in my Itch.io wallet. If Monster Train 2 were the last roguelike deckbuilder I ever played, I would consider myself fairly pleased, and also very relieved. While not a huge departure from the game that plunged Matt Cox (RPS in peace) into unholy raptures, it's a great pick if you're fond of numbers going up and realising it's 1.30am and that you are now too addled by card synergies to sleep. You do not have to like or understand trains, but it's a plus. Read more",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What did you have for breakfast? Protein smoothie with whey protein powder, greek yogurt, unsweetened almond milk and fruit (apples and strawberries). It’s easy, doesn’t require turning on the stove and it keeps me full for hours. 2. How did you do your hair today? I’m wearing it down, with soft, barely there waves. Kinda boring but it’s practical for me because it takes about five minutes to style. Plus wearing it down helps with the migraines (I get bad ones). 3. What’s your favorite summer month? June. It’s the end of the school year, and you feel like the whole summer is ahead of you! It’s also warm but not too hot yet. Oh, and it’s my birthday month, too. Yay, to all my cray-cray geminis![Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 879 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Crisis between colleagues! Today, a special meeting of the Board of Directors of Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC was called to review a most disturbing matter — the repeated and inexplicable disappearance of Chief Feline Officer Rosie’s crunchies. At various times over the past few weeks, Rosie’s food bowl, which had been previously full, has become empty, and as you can imagine, this caused quite a corporate kerfuffle. The results of an internal investigation were inconclusive, but Rosie thinks she knows who’s doing it… Since the official investigation was inconclusive, the board hasn’t taken any action, but Rosie’s suspicions have created a lot of tension… Unfortunately for Marnie, she has a lengthy record of snack theft, so her history isn’t doing her any favors. Plus, she was captured on security footage early this morning in the vicinity of Rosie’s food bowl. When asked about it by the company investigator, Marnie lawyered up… I just hope this gets resolved soon because it’s been bad for morale in the office. 🙂 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 861 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
