    "description": "Nearly three years ago, Netflix revealed plans to make a Gears of War movie based on the popular video game franchise. Now, the streamer is reportedly circling John Wick co-director David Leitch to bring Marcus Fenix and Delta Squad to live-action.According to The Hollywood Reporter, Leitch is currently in negotiations to helm Gears of War, but his deal hasn't been closed yet. Leitch is a former stuntman who wasn't credited for co-directing the original John Wick with Chad Stahelski. Since then, Leitch has established himself as a solo director with Deadpool 2, Fast \u0026 Furious Presents: Hobbs \u0026 Shaw, Atomic Blonde, Bullet Train, and The Fall Guy.Even if Leitch's contract with Netflix does eventually get signed, Gears of War seemingly won't be his next film. The director is reportedly preparing to shoot Amazon MGM Studio's heist thriller How to Rob a Bank, which has Nicholas Hoult and Anna Sawai attached to star in it.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "All game delays have their silver linings, and it looks like Grand Theft Auto VI's might just be the fact that it's given a lot of players more time to experience GTA V.Earlier today, Rockstar parent company Take-Two Interactive held its quarterly investor presentation, during which it revealed that the critically-acclaimed action-adventure game has now reached 215 million copies sold. Back in February, that number--while still extremely high--was around 210 million. This means that in the last three months, the 12-year-old game has sold a staggering five million additional copies. To put that into perspective, Monster Hunter Wilds is currently 2025's best-selling game and sits at about 10 million units sold after being released back in February. Though GTA V still has quite a ways to go if it wants to take down the top two best-selling video games of all time, this is still an incredibly impressive feat.This investor presentation marks the first one held by Take-Two Interactive since Grand Theft Auto VI's delay. Despite this setback, the company repeatedly emphasized its upcoming slate of games for 2025--Borderlands 4 and Mafia: The Old Country being the most notable--and the gaming industry's projected growth.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios are cooking. I'm not exactly sure what just yet, but there's a faint aroma of a new game in the air, and it doesn't seem like they're ready to share anything about the game right now either. Still, after the runaway success of Helldivers 2, something new from the studio is still an exciting prospect. Interestingly enough though, whatever they're making, it won't have anything to do with PlayStation when it comes to funding. Read more",

    "description": "That Hideo Kojima is a bit of an odd chap, 'ey? It was only recently he said that he wants to make a game where the protagonist forgets their own abilities if you, the player, take a long break between play sessions. As a reminder this comes from the guy who made a whole game about delivering packages, another game where a character can die of old age if you wait long enough, and another game that knows if you've played Castlevania or not. The guy likes doing things differently! Read more",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What made you smile today? It’s early in the day (I just woke up 30 minutes ago), but so far petting Marnie and Rosie, and re-reading the homemade Mother’s Day card Connor made are two things that made me smile. 2. What’s the first thing you do when you get home and walk through the door? Hmmm, well, I want to say that I usually take off my shoes first thing because, hello, I need foot freedom (shoes are so oppressive), but I think what I technically do is lock the door behind me. 3. What’s your favorite cereal? Does oatmeal count? If it doesn’t then, it’s Kellogg’s Special K with the dried red strawberries. I don’t really eat it for breakfast, though. It’s more of a[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 878 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "It’s almost dusk here at Casa de MBB, and we’re getting cleaned up and ready for bed, but I still wanted to wish you a Happy Mother’s Day. There’s so much to say about Mother’s Day, isn’t there? It can be an emotional day in many ways for many reasons, different for everyone. People have such different relationships with their parents and their children and all of the creatures they care for, and life is fleeting. We all lose our care givers and loved ones someday, and days like today mean different things to all of us at different times in our lives. I pray and hope your day was good to you. Every Mother’s Day, just like every other day, I also think about Tabs. Oh! — sometimes when I see an old picture like this one below, I tear up, especially on Mother’s Day. I sure miss my special boy! Rosie As you may or may not know, Rosie the Magnificent has her own connection to Mother’s Day because she is… A mother![Continue reading...] The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 860 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
