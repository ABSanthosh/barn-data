    "description": "Henry Cavill's days as the Man of Steel and Geralt of Rivia may be behind him, but he's got his next franchise lined up. Cavill has signed on to star in the upcoming live-action adaptation of Voltron from Amazon MGM Studios.According to The Hollywood Reporter, Cavill is only the second member of the Voltron cast to be announced. Daniel Quinn-Toye, a relative unknown, was also cast in a leading role after he won accolades for performing as Tom Holland's understudy in a Romeo \u0026 Juliet production in London's West End.No details about Cavill's role were disclosed, but if the film is staying close to the source material then he's likely playing Keith Kogane, the leader of a group of five space explorers who were sent by the Galaxy Alliance to the planet Arus. After their arrival, the team discovers the lost robot lions that let them combine and form Voltron in order to oppose King Zarkon and his Drule empire. Voltron is the only force in the universe that can stand up to Zarkon's monstrous robeasts and his plans to conquer Arus.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

When I first laid eyes on Secret Door's Sunderfolk, while lurking to the rear of a gaggle of journomancers at a preview event last week, I let out an ostentatious sigh. Fortunately, I still mask up to preview events, and am thus free to adopt all kinds of snotty facial expressions without being set upon by burly PRs and shoved into the minifridge for later disposal. To sum it up, Sunderfolk is a hex and turn-based 2-4 player digital boardgame with fantasy animal characters and deckbuilding elements, reminiscent of Gloomhaven. Conceived during the pandemic lockdowns as a way to \"bring back game night\", but without the traditional 30-minute unboxing ritual, it's played on the big screen but controlled using a dedicated smartphone app, with players stroking and swiping to move characters and play cards.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Last person who complimented you on your makeup? My coworker last week. I was wearing a little more coverage than usual, so I think the overall look was more polished than the bare bones FOTDs I’ve been wearing for months now. Amazing what a difference a little bit of concealer makes! 2. Last dream you can remember? Marnie and I were like the Scooby Doo detectives in our neighborhood, ha ha ha! We were working a case to unveil who had stolen all the tuna sandwiches in our circle. 3. Today the temperature in my neighborhood is/was ____. The Bay Area is experiencing a heat wave, ugh! It’s supposed to hit 94. I’m so over it. 4. Your cookie of choice? Lately I’ve been obsessed with snickerdoodles.[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 851 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Rosie soaked up the last bits of summery weather today. She enjoyed basking underneath the trees, which still have leaves on them (but not for long). Among the many things she contemplated were cold fusion, a better way to produce nutritionally dense cat treats, how Marnie the dog is slowly ruining her life, and most importantly, what she’ll wear for Halloween. Unlike Tabs, who loved elaborate costumes, Rosie likes to keep it simple and chic. I asked if she needed any help brainstorming, but all I got were slow blinks and a tum flash in return. When it got too hot to be outside, Rosie made her way back indoors. I couldn’t help but notice her ignoring Marnie… I suspect Rosie’s afraid of Marnie rocking a costume that will steal Rosie’s thunder. Marnie, on the other hand, hasn’t even begun to think about Halloween. She started Marathoning Gilmore Girls this weekend, and she’s currently obsessed.
