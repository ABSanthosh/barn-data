    "description": "It's an exciting time to be a Nintendo fan with the launch of the Switch 2 console. Along with new releases like Mario Kart World, a bunch of exciting games are on the way, including Donkey Kong Bananza to Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. But the arrival of the Switch 2 also presents a nice opportunity to revisit or play some of the best games from the Switch era for the first time. More than a dozen Switch games have received free performance and/or feature updates for Switch 2. If you're looking to pick up any of these Switch games for the first time, we've put together a list of where to buy all of them. Switch Games with Free Switch 2 Upgrades You can save $10 or more on a bunch of them. See at Amazon Many of the updated games now play in higher resolutions on Switch 2, and some also offer improved frame rates and HDR support. Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, for instance, genuinely looks like a different game at 1080p and 60fps. Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, and a few other great Mario platformers have also received free performance upgrades. Some of upgraded Switch games, such as Mario spin-off puzzle game Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker and Clubhouse Games, now support the Switch 2's new GameChat feature.Nintendo still sells all of the Switch games in the list below for original MSRP on the eShop, which means you can often around 10 bucks by opting for physical copies. It's worth noting that Walmart and Amazon often have numerous store pages for each game, including imports from Europe and other regions. The Switch and Switch 2 are region-free consoles, so you can play physical copies released in other markets. We've made note of the imported editions below.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

In particular, there was one game that drew my attention: Stray Children. It caught my eye in part because it has a really unique pixel art look to it, but also because Yoshiro Kimura was its director, one of the original designers of cult-classic Moon: Remix RPG Adventure. And now, after a bit of a wait, developer Onion Games have confirmed it's getting its English release later this year, and it'll even be doing so on PC. Read more",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What time do you usually wake up in the morning? These days, 6 in the morning. Ideally my day would start off at 5:30, though. 2. How organized is your purse? It’s on the verge of haphazard, always, LOL! I mean, I can find the usual things I absolutely need – my phone, wallet, keys, medication, lipgloss. But do I find those things in an efficient manner? No. 3. If you could make one rule that everyone around you had to follow, what would it be? Make your deadlines. I can’t stand it when people are casual about due dates! 4. How do you feel about wearing makeup when it’s hot? I’ll do it, but I don’t like to do too many layers. I’m happy with cream[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 881 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Tabs always said that in kitty modeling, the best defense is a good offense. If you just rest on your laurels, sooner or later a hungrier up-and-coming cat (or Australian Shepherd) will take what’s yours, and you won’t be walking the catwalk at feline fashion week anymore. Nope, if you’re lucky, you’ll get a page in the Petco catalog. Every once in a while Tabs went into kitty ninja mode, and instead of just patrolling the neighborhood, he conducted more advanced cat recon… He’d inspect the houses on the circle more closely to look for signs of canine or feline incursion. One day, he picked up a new cat’s scent around an air conditioning filter a couple houses down. He sniffed the area for a long time, gathering intelligence, and then used the data to compile a cat profile. According to Tabs, the new cat was a three-year-old male tabby with green eyes and a crooked tail… Moderate kitty modeling potential. Of course, he was added to the database. 🙂 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict,[Continue reading...] The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 863 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
