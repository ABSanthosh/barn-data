The online electronics retailer has created console bundles themed around the Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild. These Switch 2 bundles will cost you $620, $665, or $700, depending on which one you pick, so shoppers who aren't Zelda fans will probably have a hard time justifying the cost here. That said, the $700 version comes with Nintendo's Mario Kart World Bundle and the official Samsung 256GB microSD Express Card. See all Switch 2 bundles If you're not interested in these pricey bundle offers, the good news is that you'll have another chance to buy the Nintendo Switch 2 on its own or bundled with Mario Kart World very soon. Walmart is restocking both models on its online storefront later tonight (June 25). All customers can try to get a console before they sell out again starting at 7 PM PT / 10 PM ET.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Do you care about Labubus? Nah, I just don’t get the hype. 2. What’s your favorite summer dessert? Hmm, all of them? If pressed to pick one, then ice cream. 3. Do you have plans for the Fourth of July yet? Connor will be dancing with her dance team in the town parade, so that’s our main event during the day. We’ll probably do a barbeque at home after the parade. Where we live doesn’t allow fireworks, so we may or may not go looking for a fireworks display. We’ll see how ambitious we’re feeling! 4. How do you feel about maxi dresses? If it’s in a petite size and the print isn’t too overwhelming, then I’ll rock a maxi dress, for sure. 5.
