But fans won't have to wait very long to learn what else Microsoft's gaming division has planned for the future, as the next Xbox Showcase is scheduled to take place in February.According to IGN, this year's IGN Fan Fest will begin with an Xbox Showcase on February 24. Aside from the reveal of \"the next big collaboration for Balatro,\" details are scarce about what to specifically expect beyond trailers and gameplay footage. However, the announcement of the showcase does note that there will be several reveals from indie studios including Raw Fury, Team 17, Akapura, 11 Bit, and more.During one of last year's Xbox Showcases, Microsoft announced World Of Warcraft: The War Within and Doom: The Dark Ages, as well as 2025 titles including South of Midnight, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Fragpunk, and Fable. We can only speculate which titles will be showcased in February, but we'd certainly like to see more of Gears of War: E-Day, the upcoming prequel to the long-running shooter franchise.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "It has rained for almost a week! I’m getting kinda over it, but Tabs sure would have loved it. That cat LOVED the rain. His favorite thing about it? Rainbows. 🌈 Mind you, I also like the rain. But Tabs didn’t just like the rain. He loved it! I think what he liked about it was all the movement. My theory is that with his heightened cat senses, he could actually track the falling of individual raindrops. Rosie, however, is not a big fan of rain. In fact, she doesn’t particularly enjoy anything about it. Scratch that — I’m mistaken. There is one thing about rain she agrees with Tabs on. Rainbows are fantastic! 🌈😺 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 849 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Pick one: colorful shoes or a colorful sweater? Let’s go with the colorful shoes. Life is too short for boring footwear! 2. Which would you rather never have to deal with again: nosy neighbors, parallel parking, burnt food or washing your makeup brushes? Once, I caught a neighbor going through our trash. So I could do without the nosy neighbors, LOL! 3. Have you ever crimped your hair? Yes, but sadly, I never got to do it in the ‘80s (I was too young and missed all the cool stuff). 4. Who does the grocery shopping in your household? Mostly me, but El Hub will do it if he has extra time and/or if I’m busy with Connor doing extracurriculars. 5. Liquid liner: yes or no?
