    "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-for-ps5-is-only-40-at-amazon/1100-6528630/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f",
    "description": "Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade for PS5 $40 (was $70) See at Amazon See at Best Buy ($70) See at Walmart ($55) See at Target (sold out) Amazon has dropped the price of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade for PS5 to only $40. The PS5 physical edition had been out of print for years, which led to some rather ridiculous prices on the reseller market. Earlier this year, Square Enix finally printed a fresh batch of the sought-after edition that bundles the base game and the Intermission DLC. Multiple retailers sold out of the reprinted copies months ago, while others still regularly sell it for its full $70 list price. Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade for PS5 $40 (was $70) Final Fantasy 7 Remake is a gorgeous reboot of the classic 1997 game it's based on. Set primarily within the early Midgar chapters of Final Fantasy 7, the remake gives Cloud Strife and the rest of the Avalanche crew a massive graphical glow-up as they fight to stop Shinra Inc. from turning the planet's life essence into a power source. Ghosts from the past threaten Cloud and his friends, and toward the end of the game, there are major changes to the storyline that shake up the status quo.The Intermission expansion focuses on Yuffie Kisaragi and her partner Sonon Kusakabe as they work to steal a powerful artifact from Shinra. This is a short but fun add-on to the main campaign of Final Fantasy 7 Remake, which also saw various technical and graphical improvements added to the game. It's a fairly linear game overall--with some annoying padding--but if you're looking to revisit the cyberpunk world of Square Enix's beloved sci-fantasy game, Final Fantasy 7 Remake won't disappoint.It's also worth noting that Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade is getting a Nintendo Switch 2 port. Though it's not available to preorder yet and no release date has been set, we'd expect it to receive a physical edition, too. See at Amazon See at Best Buy ($70) See at Walmart ($55) Final Fantasy 7 Remake: Material Ultimania Plus $25 (was $40) See at Amazon Final Fantasy 7 Remake: Material Ultimania $25 (was $40) See at Amazon You should also check out the official Material Ultimania book focused on the PS5 version of FF7 Remake. Published in November, Final Fantasy 7 Remake: Material Ultimania Plus takes fans behind the scenes for a look at the creation of the heralded RPG. Normally $40, the hardcover edition of the new book is on sale for $25 at Amazon. You can also save $15 on the first Final Fantasy 7 Remake: Material Ultimania book, which drops the price to $25. This 336-page hardcover focuses on FF7 Remake's original PS4 version.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So‚Ä¶what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn‚Äôt, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It‚Äôs just a list of more or less random questions I‚Äôve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What did you have for breakfast? Protein smoothie with whey protein powder, greek yogurt, unsweetened almond milk and fruit (apples and strawberries). It‚Äôs easy, doesn‚Äôt require turning on the stove and it keeps me full for hours. 2. How did you do your hair today? I‚Äôm wearing it down, with soft, barely there waves. Kinda boring but it‚Äôs practical for me because it takes about five minutes to style. Plus wearing it down helps with the migraines (I get bad ones). 3. What‚Äôs your favorite summer month? June. It‚Äôs the end of the school year, and you feel like the whole summer is ahead of you! It‚Äôs also warm but not too hot yet. Oh, and it‚Äôs my birthday month, too. Yay, to all my cray-cray geminis![Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 879 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Crisis between colleagues! Today, a special meeting of the Board of Directors of Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC was called to review a most disturbing matter ‚Äî the repeated and inexplicable disappearance of Chief Feline Officer Rosie‚Äôs crunchies. At various times over the past few weeks, Rosie‚Äôs food bowl, which had been previously full, has become empty, and as you can imagine, this caused quite a corporate kerfuffle. The results of an internal investigation were inconclusive, but Rosie thinks she knows who‚Äôs doing it‚Ä¶ Since the official investigation was inconclusive, the board hasn‚Äôt taken any action, but Rosie‚Äôs suspicions have created a lot of tension‚Ä¶ Unfortunately for Marnie, she has a lengthy record of snack theft, so her history isn‚Äôt doing her any favors. Plus, she was captured on security footage early this morning in the vicinity of Rosie‚Äôs food bowl. When asked about it by the company investigator, Marnie lawyered up‚Ä¶ I just hope this gets resolved soon because it‚Äôs been bad for morale in the office. üôÇ Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 861 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
