Several of his movies have received new steelbook edition 4K Blu-ray releases in the past few months, and soon, his first movie, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, will join the collection. While there's no release date set, listings are up at Amazon, and we expect it will be available soon. In the meantime, there are several other Hosoda films available for preorder and purchase now, including Wolf Children, Summer Wars, and Belle. We've compiled all the Hosoda 4K steelbook Blu-rays in the list below. The Girl Who Leapt Through Time 4K Steelbook Blu-ray $37 | Relase date TBA The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is Hosoda's first film and originally released back in 2001. It follows Makoto Konno, a teenager who attains time-travel powers. At first, she uses her abilities to fix frivolous problems, but she quickly learns that meddling with timelines can have drastic consequences. This limited edition 4K Blu-ray release includes an exclusive steelbook case.Bonus materials for the film haven't been confirmed yet, but previous Blu-ray releases for The Girl Who Leapt Through Time include tons of excellent extras, and there's a strong chance some of those are folded into this new 4K Steelbook Edition.While The Girl Who Leapt Through Time 4K Steelbook Blu-ray is listed at Amazon, it doesn't have a release date and is currently unavailable to purchase. We expect it'll be in stock again soon, however. In the meantime, there are several other Hosoda films up for preorder and available to purchase now.

After her husband tragically dies, Hana moves to an old house in the countryside to raise her children in this touching tale about motherhood, loss, and family. Special features include a commentary track from the cast and crew, promotional materials, and more. Preorder at Amazon Summer Wars 4K Steelbook Blu-ray (Amazon-exclusive) $30 Earlier this year, Hosuda's Summer Wars also received a 4K Steelbook Edition available exclusively at Amazon.

    "description": "Through Netflix, producer Adi Shankar has already adapted Castlevania and Devil May Cry as anime series. Now, Shankar has revealed that he's picked up the rights for Duke Nukem, the first-person shooter franchise with a very dirty sense of humor created by developer 3D Realms.\"I bought the rights to Duke Nukem,\" said Shankar during an interview with Esquire. \"Not the gaming rights, but I bought it from Gearbox... It's a middle finger to everybody. When Duke Nukem blew up, a bunch of people sat around trying to turn it into a brand, when it's just a middle finger. Duke Nukem can't be made by a corporation, because the moment a corporation makes Duke Nukem, it's no longer Duke Nukem. I don't intend on having anyone tell me what to do on this one.\"It's unclear how or if Shankar's deal with Gearbox affects the live-action Duke Nukem movie in development at Legendary with the creators of Cobra Kai. That project hasn't had many updates since it was announced in 2022. Similarly, the most recent game in the franchise, Duke Nukem Forever, was released in 2011, and there haven't been any new Duke Nukem games, or talk of making any sequels, since.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Do you care about Labubus? Nah, I just don’t get the hype. 2. What’s your favorite summer dessert? Hmm, all of them? If pressed to pick one, then ice cream. 3. Do you have plans for the Fourth of July yet? Connor will be dancing with her dance team in the town parade, so that’s our main event during the day. We’ll probably do a barbeque at home after the parade. Where we live doesn’t allow fireworks, so we may or may not go looking for a fireworks display. We’ll see how ambitious we’re feeling! 4. How do you feel about maxi dresses? If it’s in a petite size and the print isn’t too overwhelming, then I’ll rock a maxi dress, for sure. 5.
