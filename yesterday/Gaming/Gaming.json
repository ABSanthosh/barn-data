    "description": "Winter Holiday and Christmas Lego Sets These winter seasonal exclusives are available at multiple retailers. Shop at Amazon Shop at Lego Store Shop at Walmart Clocks have officially fallen back an hour, bringing with them shorter days and longer nights. Thankfully, the holiday season is right around the corner to make the cold dark a bit more bearable--and what better way to get into the holiday spirit than with a new Lego set? Each year, Lego releases a batch of seasonal Lego sets for the winter holidays. Some are brand new, while others are popular kits from previous years. These sets are generally only available this time of year--unless you buy them from a reseller. Over at Amazon, several adorable Christmas-themed Lego sets are now available, including Santa’s Sleigh, Nutcracker Figure, Gingerbread Ornaments, Christmas Tree, and more. Winter Holiday and Christmas Lego Sets These winter seasonal exclusives are available at multiple retailers. Santa’s Sleigh (343 pieces) -- $38 ($40)Nutcracker Figure (208 pieces) -- $13Gingerbread Ornaments (190 pieces) --12 ($13)Christmas Tree (784 pieces) -- $44Santa's Post Office (1,440 pieces) -- $100Santa's Delivery Truck (224 pieces) -- $20Poinsettia (608 pieces) -- $50Christmas Wreath: 2-in-1 (510 pieces) -- $60Holiday Main Street Christmas Village (1,514 pieces) -- $86 ($100)Alpine Lodge (1,517 pieces) -- $100Wreath (1,194 pieces) -- $100Home Alone: McCallisters’ House (3,955 pieces) -- $300The Lego Store also has most of the seasonal sets plus two other jolly builds you won't find anywhere else: Santa's Post Office and Santa's Delivery Truck. The 1,440-piece Santa's Post Office, shown in the image above, comes with minifigures of Santa and four elves, all of whom are hard at work sorting through wishlists from kids around the world.The buttons below will lead you to each retailer's holiday- and Christmas-themed Lego sets. Shop at Amazon Shop at Lego Store Shop at Walmart Lego Santa’s Sleigh is one of the most popular choices, and it’s currently seeing a bit of a discount. Listed for $38 (was $40), the 343-brick set lets you snap together a sleigh overflowing with Christmas gifts. You’ll also find four reindeer figures and a Santa minifigure, plus a variety of decorated saddles and gifts like a guitar, skis, and a teddy bear.Santa's Sleigh Lego SetGallery It’s not tall enough to replace a real Christmas tree, but the 11-inch Lego Christmas Tree is a fairly big build for its $44 price. The 784-piece set comes with plenty of small ornaments for you to place on its blocky limbs, along with a star topper. You also have the option to build two smaller trees instead of one big one--so if you’re shopping for siblings, they can each make their own tree.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Minor spoilers for the first few hours of Veilguard and heavy spoilers for Baldur’s Gate 3 For all the things I ended up enjoying about Dragon Age: The Veilguard, it isn’t much of an RPG. What little roleplaying it does offer revolves around what flavour of supportive hero you prefer, and you can count the number of impactful dialogue decisions on a three-fingered hand. This might sound utterly damning in the wake of Baldur's Gate 3’s incredible reactivity, and if I approached games as some sort of tedious comparative intellectual exercise rather than just, y’know, seeing how I felt about them, then I suppose it would be. Weirdly, though, the recent memory of Baldur’s Gate 3 didn’t diminish my time with Veilguard at all. It was actually the opposite: it freed Dragon Age from having to carry the torch for a certain period in Bioware’s history, and let me enjoy Veilguard for what it was. Read more",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Last show you binged watched? “The Diplomat” season 2 on Netflix with Keri Russell. It’s a little silly but I like how they weave real things that happen in the world into it. 2. Have you started planning for Thanksgiving yet? Girl, no. LOL! I barely made it through the Halloween season, which honestly felt like it was three years long. I know in a few years, when Connor’s older, I’ll miss all the activities. Anyway, for Thanksgiving, we’re invited to a dinner that a friend is hosting, so we’ll probably do that. Or, we’ll just stay at home in our jammies, watch movies and have a crab fest again. So fun! 3. Pick your fall nail color – red, burgundy or dark blue? Ooh, burgundy please![Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 855 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Last year Harris, that dastardly lothario, won the annual Novato pumpkin growing contest, which came as a huge shock to Rosie because she thinks he’s mentally inferior. While that may be true, Harris has figured out how to grow big pumpkins. This year, Rosie isn’t holding back. She’s put a lot of time and scientific work into maximizing her pumpkin yields. She also read a bunch of books on botany and interviewed all the top minds in the field. Hopefully she can reclaim the crown that Tabs once had. 😸 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 836 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
