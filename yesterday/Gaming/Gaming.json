Poor Tabs… He was slightly confused about the overall gist of the festivities. I think he thought it was a get-together to celebrate him. We didn’t want to burst his bubble, so we took a brief interlude to sing him the birthday song. “Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear tabby… Happy birthday to you!” 🙂 Connor Claire didn’t mind, and there was more than enough food, fun and love for everyone. It was kind of weird, but for the most part, Tabs wasn’t as social as he usually is. He spent most of the afternoon napping at the top of the stairs, away from the party. I checked in on him from time to time and gave him chin scratches and whispered that I love him.

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Which would you rather have: an epic eyeshadow collection or an epic lipstick collection? My eye makeup game has been super minimal for the past couple of years, so epic lipstick collection it is! 2. If you could only wear one type of pants for the rest of your life, which would you pick: yoga/workout leggings, jeans, chinos or overalls? Although I like the idea of wearing pants with stretch, I do not love the idea of wearing leggings that hug my butt so closely for the rest of my life. UGH. But I guess I’d go with yoga/workout leggings, simply because I can’t imagine working out in jeans or chinos. And I guess one could dress leggings up for formal occasions? 3.
