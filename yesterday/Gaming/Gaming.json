    "description": "Developer CD Projekt RED has uploaded a generous batch of Switch 2 Cyberpunk 2077 footage last week - 37 minutes of direct 4K capture to be exact - giving us an early glimpse at the state of its docked 30fps quality mode. Since it releases on 5th June as a Switch 2 launch title, we don't really have too long to wait to see the real thing in action, though given that this footage comes with no \"early build\" disclaimer or suchlike it appears CDPR is confident in what it's showing in this material - and for good reason. Poring over all the assets, we have plenty to work with for some preliminary comparisons and even frame-rate analysis. In short, the prospects for this Switch 2 rendition are encouraging overall.

Besides the environmental hazards of fire tornadoes, lava ponds, and explosive volcanoes, Moriana will also have six new enemies to contend with, culminating in a showdown with the Lord of the Underworld himself: the Devil. Not to worry, though, the introduction of three new abilities—Frost Nova, Frost Bolt, and Blizzard—will help her keep her cool. This update also introduces the skill tree mechanic, where",

    "description": "Last year, Polished Games' top-down 2D survival roguelite Be My Horde introduced players to Moriana, a necromancer--or necromancess, if you prefer--who can make the dead serve as her army. She's the villain of her own story, so it shouldn't be too surprising that Moriana is heading to Hell in the game's newest update. If anything, that's bad news for demons, because Moriana might be taking over Hell one circle at a time.The name of update is \"Welcome to Hell,\" and it adds the Hell level, which may be Moriana's biggest challenge to date. As seen in the newly released trailer below, Moriana's travels through Hell will bring her face-to-face with the Devil himself. That video also offers a more in-depth look at what awaits in Hell. Moriana and her undead minions will have to battle new enemies and survive the severe hazards of the underworld. Fire tornadoes, lava ponds, and explosive volcanoes all stand between Moriana and her destiny.As you may have noticed, Moriana's powers thrive on death, and she can turn every fallen enemy into one of her new warriors. There's no entrance test for this army. If Moriana can kill it, it's her's to command, even if it's just an exploding sheep. However, Moriana is not invincible and she can be defeated in battle. But she always returns with a vengeance.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. When was the last time you spent a good amount of time outside? Yesterday morning. Connor had a sleepover with a friend the night before, and the girls wanted to play outside, so we all hung out in the circle.
