    "description": "Video games have spawned tons of iconic mecha designs over the years, but there's something timeless about Metal Gear Solid's bipedal powerhouse, Metal Gear Rex. If you've ever wanted to own one--but don't have the billions in cash necessary to build a 1:1 replica--then this upcoming collectible from Megahouse is a nice alternative. The $170 figure launches November 2025 and preorders are available now. Metal Gear Solid Variable Action D-SPEC Metal Gear Rex $170 | Releases November 2025 The Metal Gear Solid Variable Action D-SPEC Metal Gear Rex figure includes plenty of articulation and is packed with recognizable details like the iconic shoulder-mounted railgun, the radar dome, the animalistic \"mouth\" cockpit design. The figure also comes with two minifigures of Solid Snake and Liquid Snake, just in case you feel like reenacting the climactic showdown between the two brothers. Both figures are small enough to fit in Rex's cockpit section, and the Solid Snake figure includes a swappable spare arm that holds his MK 23 SOCOM sidearm. Preorder at Entertainment Earth If you'd like to add to your Metal Gear Solid collection, there are a few other nice figures to preorder right now. There's a new Figma action figure of Solid Snake based on his design from Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. The highly posable figure includes several accessories, like his SOCOM pistol and handy cardboard box disguise. Priced at $87, this will start shipping out in January 2026.For something cuter, Good Smile Company is reissuing its Raiden and Solid Snake Nendoroid collectibles, which turn the gruff super-soldiers into cute chibi figures. The Solid Snake one is especially good as it comes with two head sculpts--a Nendoroid-style head with a dynamic bandana and an alternate head that makes Snake look exactly like his 1998 character model. Tubbz also has an adorable Solid Snake figure that reimagines the character as a floating rubber ducky.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Act II of Destiny 2 Episode Heresy has brought with it a new surprise on the Dreadnought. Along with the whisperings of a familiar foe in players' ears, they will also take on a familiar challenge. The new activity, Court of Blades, is a boss-rush mode similar to the original Court of Oryx activity from Destiny: The Taken King. Here's how the Court of Blades works and what it can give players on completion.Table of Contents [hide]Destiny 2 Court of Blades explainedDestiny 2 Court of Blades explainedThe Court of Blades is an enemy gauntlet activity where players face an escalating series of enemies within a 10-minute time limit. As the activity progresses, there will be two bosses per phase of the activity--one small and one major. Upon spawning into the activity, players will need to each select an Augmentation from one of the two statues on either side of the room they enter. This Augmentation will provide different conditions throughout the fight that players will need to adapt to. These Augmentations will also stack, so multiple conditions can exist simultaneously.Some examples of what can show up include Banish, in which players will need to find and defeat three Taken Wizards quickly or be teleported out of the room mid-fight to a dome-like area where they will need to fight a separate miniboss to escape. Another one is Sharpen, where players will encounter an invincible Knight with a shield that needs to be stripped away using the swords dropped by smaller knights. Keep in mind these objectives exist on top of what needs to be done to defeat the major bosses of each phase.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Which would you rather have in your makeup collection: a nail polish that never chipped, a foundation that perfectly matched your skin tone, a long-lasting mascara that was easy to remove or a lipstick that never dried out your lips? Nail polish that never chipped! In a heartbeat. 2. How good are you at doing other people’s hair? Not great. Actually, terrible. I realized I really need to work at it when I tried to do Connor’s hair in a french braid for a dance competition, and it looked so wonky it was laughable. 3. What do you do when you’re sitting on a flight next to a stranger: chat them up or put in your headphones and pretend they’re not there? I’ll do a little polite[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 870 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Which would you rather collect: vintage clothes or vintage furniture? I could do both, but if I could only pick one, I’d have to go with vintage clothes, mostly because I don’t have a big enough house to collect furniture pieces. Sigh! Oh, and also, I don’t want to worry about my furniture being beat up by the pets and the kids playing in my house, you know? 2. How good are you with keeping secrets? If you tell me something in confidence, it’s going to the grave with me, babe; however, I do have an exception policy. If I believe someone’s in danger, then I’m gonna say something. 3. Who’s the coolest Jennifer: Jennifer Hudson, Jennifer Lopez, Jennifer Garner or Jennifer Coolidge? Jennifer Coolidge, all the[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 869 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
