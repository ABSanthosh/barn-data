Escape Simulator 2 will explore \"darker escape room themes\", looks visually more detailed, and comes with a new editor for those who wish to design their own escape rooms. Read more",

You know, MAC Club eyeshadow? Of course you do. It’s a classic. Last week, out of nowhere, I thought to myself, “I really need to wear Club.” It’s been years since I’ve wanted to deal with complicated eye makeup, but I got the urge, so I went with it. My makeup collection is pretty barren compared to the thick of MBB’s beauty blogging days, but I’ve held on to this ancient Monster’s Bride palette from —I don’t even wanna say the year. LOL! I’ve always loved the shadows, especially Club. I took a little bit of Club, popped it on my lids and smoothed out the edges with a fluffy brush dipped in face powder.

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. A habit that changed your life? Getting up early. For most of my life I was a night owl, and when I had Connor that all changed. When she was an infant, I started waking up at the crack of dawn to sneak in work before she woke up in the morning. The habit ended up sticking, and now I’m an early bird. 2. Fruit or cupcakes? As much as I love a small cake smothered in frosting, I’m gonna have to go with fruit. 3. Are you doing any advent calendars this year? At Trader Joe’s a couple weeks ago, I picked up a few for the “kids” – Connor, Rosie and Marnie. Ha ha ha! 4. Something on your Christmas list?

Movie Power-Up Steelbook Edition (4K) $28 | Restocked at Walmart on Dec. 6 See at Walmart The Super Mario Bros. Movie is getting a new 4K Blu-ray release with a steelbook case on March 4, 2025. Exclusive to Walmart and available to preorder now for $28, The Super Mario Bros. Limited Edition Steelbook is likely to sell out fast. Walmart's exclusive steelbook releases of popular films often sell out well before launch, and we're talking about the biggest video game adaptation of all time here.In a bizarre plot twist, Walmart has also restocked the original steelbook release. You can purchase the Power-Up Edition's Collectible Steelbook version for $28, too. This edition has largely been sold out since prior to launch last June, but sporadic, briefly available restocks have popped up at major retailers over the past year.Now, the question you need to ask yourself is: Do you love Question Blocks (the new steelbook) or Super Mushrooms (the old steelbook) more? Or you could be like a-me and buy a-both.Continue Reading at GameSpot",
