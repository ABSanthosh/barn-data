    "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-battle-pass-skin-fortnite-chapter-6-season-2/2900-6264/",
    "description": "We're one week from the start of Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 in battle royale, which launches on February 21, and in a very pleasant Valentine's Day surprise, Epic has revealed the entire lineup of battle pass skins. And when we say \"lineup,\" we actually mean it literally this time, as you can see the entire crew assembled for a police lineup above. For a much closer look at each of these skins, scroll down to the gallery below for some individual glamor shots.The highlight, no doubt, is the lone collaboration on the battle pass: Sub-Zero from the fighting game series Mortal Kombat. There are eight distinct characters included in the reveal, so this should be every skin in the battle pass. Keep in mind, however, that all of them will have at least one alternate style. So, for example, we've got Sub-Zero in his classic blue look here, but we can expect at least one of his many other looks as well--there are way too many potential options to choose from, so we won't bother guessing.Beyond Sub-Zero, the pass appears to be made up largely of the colorful member of a heist crew, led by a new version of Midas who stole Domonic Toretto's gold chain--it's not quite the Fast \u0026 Furious-themed season we were hoping for, but it's close enough for now. After that, we've got a pickle man, a girl wearing a traffic cone on her head, a lady with two very long braids wearing a 19th century-inspired shirt who is not from Arcane, and a very dapper wolfman who I suspect may actually be the one getting robbed in the upcoming season.While the battle pass reveal is the biggest announcement thus far about Fortnite's upcoming Chapter 6 Season 2, it's not the only thing we know about what to expect from the new season. For everything else we know, check out our rundown here. And for much better looks at each of the skins, keep scrolling.",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Shrimp or crab? Crab, but it can’t be imitation, and it has to be fresh. 2. Yoga or pilates? Both are equally as challenging for this very out-of-shape lady at the moment. LOL! (Been a rough 12 months.) I’ll pick yoga; I could use a good stretch. 3. Something that makes you feel sentimental? When my phone brings up baby photos of Connor or old photos of Tabs before he got sick. My heart swells up every single time. 4. What book are you reading at the moment? Nothing at the moment, boo. I need a good one. Got anything to suggest? I would like something not too heavy or scary. 5. Something you wish you said no to sooner? I wish I would’ve said no to[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 868 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "It’s the Super Bowl! As you know, before Tabs rocked the world by reinventing kitty supermodeling, he entertained millions as a professional cat football player. In fact, he won the Kitty Bowl a record eight times, making him more accomplished than even Tom Brady. Yes, Tabs was quite the cat athlete. Today’s game starts in a few minutes, and while Tabs is no longer here to watch the game with me, I’m sure he’ll be watching from up above. This happens to also be the last Sunday before Valentine’s. Marnie and Rosie are both more interested in that aspect of the day than the football. I can appreciate that. 🙂 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S.
