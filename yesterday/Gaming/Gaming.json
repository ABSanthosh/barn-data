The limited-time promotion includes Madden NFL 25, EA Sports FC 25, NHL 25, and F1 2024. All four regularly sell for $70, but you can grab them for only $35 each right now. Amazon is offering the price cut for PlayStation and Xbox versions of each game.If you're picking up EA Sports FC 25, you'll also want to check out Walmart's deal. Not only is the soccer sim on sale for only $35, but it also comes with an exclusive Real Madrid steelbook case. Walmart's steelbook freebie is available for PS5 and Xbox Series X versions of EA Sports FC 25. And while it doesn't come with a steelbook, the Nintendo Switch version of FC 25 is $35 at Walmart, too. Amazon sold out of the Switch deal, so grab it from Walmart while you can.With the exception of NHL 25, which is exclusive to current-gen consoles, PS4 and Xbox One players can also take advantage of these steep discounts. The Xbox edition of Madden, NHL, and F1 grants access to Series X and Xbox One versions. For PlayStation, there are separate physical editions for PS5 and PS4. The PS4 disc comes with a free upgrade to the PS5 version. Though this free upgrade is technically for the digital version, the disc must remain in your console to play.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Left 4 Dead 2 is celebrating its 15-year anniversary today, November 17, 2024. Below, we look at how its cast and their interactions set it apart from its contemporaries and modern imitators alike.Left 4 Dead 2 has been rightfully receiving its flowers for the past 15 years. The modding community has come up with everything from visual enhancements like improved blood textures to completely user-made campaigns. The last two DLCs for the game, Cold Stream and The Last Stand, were made by community members and officially endorsed by Valve. At the time of writing, there are over 45,000 players in-game on PC, and (if you somehow still don't own it) you can play it for free during this anniversary weekend. As such, the Steam discussions are filled with dozens of threads about the Good Guy Nick Achievement, which can only be obtained when the game is on a free weekend, something that occurs every couple of years.But there's a special legacy Left 4 Dead has left behind: Valve's shooter has been a catalyst for a new subgenre altogether. Games like Back 4 Blood and The Anacrusis follow the formula closely, which isn't surprising considering the development teams include people who worked on Left 4 Dead. Others, such as Warhammer: Vermintide, Deep Rock Galactic, and Aliens: Fireteam Elite iterate on the concept of a co-op shooter by leaning closer to its own worlds, taking inspiration from existing franchises or coming up with brand-new mechanics to stand out from the rest. Yet, as more developers are taking the genre in interesting new directions, there's one crucial element that is often overlooked in these iterations.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Take, for instance, last summer’s crisis over her favorite treats, the aptly named Temptations, in tasty chicken flavor. She wanted more of them than I could provide. To be honest, she wanted them all — all of the Tasty Chicken Temptations nationwide. She threw herself into research, trying to reverse engineer the recipe for Temptations; however, every batch was a little bit off. Growing frustrated, she encountered an old sailor cat in a downtown Novato bar who told her the story of El Río de Tentación, the River of Temptation… According to the legend, hidden somewhere along the banks of the Sacramento River in Northern California were ancient ruins, within which held the Lost Book of Temptation, the book that contained the original recipe for Tasty Chicken Temptations. Rosie set out to find it! After three days of searching, during which time she became very hungry, she found the ruins….

Go for a walk with Marnie and stomp into a pile of leaves with those epic rain boots. Snuggle into a warm, cozy sweater that makes me feel amazing when I wear it. Side note, is it just me, or is it surprisingly difficult to find a sweater that fits well and ticks all the boxes? Every time I try one on, I find at least 5 things that I want to change. Handwrite a few letters on nice stationary and send them via snail mail. Watch a classic musical wearing my coziest pajamas; of course a snuggly blanket will be up in the mix, too.
