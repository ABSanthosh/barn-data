No seriously, I full-on rolled down a hill. We live in a neighborhood with tons of oak trees that produce these gigantic acorns, and as I was walking Connor down the hill to school I guess I wasn’t really paying attention to where my feet were landing, so when I stepped on an acorn, which basically was like a massive marble, my right ankle rolled underneath me. That set off a chain reaction of me falling to the ground, and right as I hit the pavement, I reflexively tucked into a round ball, which then caused me to tumble down the steep hill even more as I clung onto Connor’s little pink backpack with dear life! Honestly, I’m at a point in life where I’m just happy that if I fall, 1) I actually get back up, and 2) I[Continue reading...] The post Fall 2024 Lipstick Challenge, Day 3! appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

I’ve got the old school version in the black packaging, RIP. NARS reformulated their lip crayon line into what they call the Powermattes, and you know, sometimes I wonder why brands don’t just leave well enough alone. Anywho, I like the color of the older version, which I think is slightly cooler and more magenta. Two things before I head out! One, for some reason I always want to call this lipstick “Dragon Roll,” like it’s a type of sushi, hahaha! The second is that if I look a little dazed and confused in these pictures (which I took right before heading into the office), it’s because my co-worker caught me taking selfies, and I was kinda embarrassed to be having a full-on photo shoot in my car so early in the morning. 🙂 What lip color are you wearing today?

    "description": "Archetype Entertainment and Blur Studio's space RPG Exodus was announced back in December, and was broadly notable for a couple of things: 1) Matthew McConaughey plays a character, and 2) the game's story is woven around time dilation during faster than light travel, with star-hopping adventurers prosecuting a fight against evil Celestials over hundreds, perhaps thousands of years. Now, it is notable for three things, the third thing being a cosmic blubber-spire of gurning faces who want to eat your ship and soul. Say hello to the Mara Yama, the ickiest Celestial faction so far. Here's a trailer, in which McConaughey does that thing where he lingers on the sibilants and makes you want to lean in and vigorously mess up his hair. Read more",
