    "description": "You would think that being able to take on 14 different jobs would be enough to keep most people busy in Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time, but to Level-5 it seems like that won't be enough. Last month, the developer announced that because the RPG has done so well, they'll be releasing a free update/ bit of DLC called Update the World, and they've now offered a couple of details as to what that'll be.

    "description": "Match-3 games are probably the purest out there, at least in terms of genre. They are so instantly understandable by pretty much anyone, no wonder there's a seemingly infinite number of them available on our phones. The issue is that most of them can't match up to the heights of a classic like Bejeweled, though at least every once in a while we get delightful spins on the genre like Spirit Swap. Now, there's a new, quite tiny new kid on the block in the form of Sinister Sodies, a match-3 game where you set out to \"purify your carbonated concoction before time runs out.\" Read more",

    "description": "DC Versus Marvel Omnibus (Hardcover) $83.33 (was $150) See at Amazon See at Walmart DC Versus Marvel: The Amalgam Age Omnibus (Hardcover) $150 | Unavailable See at Amazon See at Walmart If you miss the days when DC and Marvel superheroes regularly crossed over into each other's universes, you'll want to check out the steeply discounted collection of those epic clashes at Amazon and Walmart. The 960-page DC Versus Marvel Omnibus hardcover book is on sale for only $83.33 (was $150). The nearly 50% discount is the best deal yet for the massive omnibus published by DC last October. The book contains more than a dozen crossover comics, including Superman vs. The Amazing Spider-Man, Batman/Captain America, Spider-Man and Batman, and more. DC Versus Marvel Omnibus (Hardcover) $83.33 (was $150) DC Versus Marvel Omnibus compiles a wide selection of one-shots that had been out of print for decades. Here's the full list of all the comics in this 960-page omnibus:Superman vs. The Amazing Spider-ManMarvel Treasury EditionDC Special SeriesMarvel and DC Present: Featuring the Uncanny X-Men and the New Teen TitansBatman/Punisher: Lake of FirePunisher/Batman: Deadly KnightsDarkseid Vs. Galactus: The HungerSpider-Man and BatmanGreen Lantern/Silver Surfer: Unholy AlliancesSilver Surfer/SupermanBatman/Captain AmericaDaredevil/BatmanBatman/Spider-ManSuperman/Fantastic FourIncredible Hulk Vs. SupermanBatman/DaredevilIn many of the one-shots listed above, the heroes battle each other before joining forces to defeat classic DC/Marvel supervillains. It's pretty awesome to see characters like Spider-Man and Batman in the same comic book panels.The stories included here span 25 years of DC/Marvel history, starting with Superman vs. The Amazing Spider-Man (1976) and ending with Batman/Daredevil (2000). See at Amazon See at Walmart DC Versus Marvel: The Amalgam Age Omnibus (Hardcover) $150 | Unavailable DC Versus Marvel Omnibus was initially pitched as a \"companion\" to DC Versus Marvel: The Amalgam Age Omnibus. Unfortunately, DC delayed The Amalgam Age last fall to an unspecified date. Preorders were turned off at Amazon and Walmart around the same time, and it's unclear if and when fans will be able to order it again.That said, it does appear that some lucky fans who preordered early actually received their copies over the past few months. Due to the extremely limited supply, resellers have listed it for more than double the original $150 price. Hopefully The Amalgam Age will get a proper release soon, but it's worth noting we haven't heard anything about it since its delay last fall.This is a 1,024-page collection of wild one-shots. These zany stories threw characters from each publisher into a blender and fused them together, resulting in creations like Dark Claw (Batman and Wolverine), Iron Lantern (Iron Man and Green Lantern), and Lobo the Duck (Lobo and Howard the Duck, no really).It also includes all four issues of the original Marvel vs. DC miniseries, which featured 11 colossal battles where the outcomes were decided by fan votes.

    "description": "One third-party Nintendo Switch 2 game developer told The Game Business that sales numbers were \"below our lowest estimates,\" highlighting the lukewarm performance of third-party launch titles in the first two weeks of the Switch 2's lifespan.The Nintendo Switch 2 launch lineup consisted of a healthy number of third-party titles, including Konami's Survival Kids, Square Enix's Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster, CD Projekt Red's Cyberpunk 2077, and more. According to data from Circana, cited by The Game Business, 81% of physical Nintendo Switch 2 game sales were for first-party titles, such as Mario Kart World and the Switch 2 Editions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. NielsenIQ reports Cyberpunk 2077 has been the best-selling third-party game on Switch 2 so far, while Circana's data reveals Sega is the third-biggest Switch 2 game publisher.Circana executive director Mat Piscatella posted on Bluesky that \"Third party unit share of Switch 2 physical software during week 1 reached just shy of 40%,\" which is almost double what third-party games did at the launch of the Switch 1. The Game Business did point out that improvement over the performance of third-party games on the original Switch, but also explains that \"it's hard to describe these statistics as positive.\" That's understandable, considering the Switch 2 has had one of the most successful console launches of all time, yet an anonymous publisher is claiming that even its lowest estimates overestimated how well third-party games would do on Switch 2.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Do you care about Labubus? Nah, I just don’t get the hype. 2. What’s your favorite summer dessert? Hmm, all of them? If pressed to pick one, then ice cream. 3. Do you have plans for the Fourth of July yet? Connor will be dancing with her dance team in the town parade, so that’s our main event during the day. We’ll probably do a barbeque at home after the parade. Where we live doesn’t allow fireworks, so we may or may not go looking for a fireworks display. We’ll see how ambitious we’re feeling! 4. How do you feel about maxi dresses? If it’s in a petite size and the print isn’t too overwhelming, then I’ll rock a maxi dress, for sure. 5.

Lots of high-intensity lounging, TV watching and chillaxin’… Rosie, purr usual, spent the day working on her science experiments. That reminds me… Tabs wasn’t particularly interested in science or genetics like Rosie is, but he was interested in acting as a father figure to at-risk kittens and a mentor to up-and-coming kitty supermodels. Despite his busy schedule, he always made time for the kittens in his foundation. He would read to them, do homework with them, teach them how to strut and strike poses on the catwalk — all the basic life skills. Rosie Rosie’s view of Father’s Day is a little different. As an introverted, more science-minded cat, she’s more interested in the genetic aspects of parentage.
