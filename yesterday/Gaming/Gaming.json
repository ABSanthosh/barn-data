See at Amazon Frieren: Beyond Journey's End is a critically acclaimed anime adaptation of Kanehito Yamada and Tsukasa Abe's manga. The fantasy series follows the titular elf mage Frieren as she sets off on a long journey to find the resting place of souls so that she can reunite with her former comrade Himmel, who led the party to slay the Demon King decades ago. As an elf, Frieren is blessed--or cursed--with an absurdly long lifespan, and she experiences time differently from her human companions. The show earned high praise from audiences and critics for its nuanced characters, gorgeous animation, and detailed fantasy world-building.While these Blu-ray releases will catch up on the anime's run so far, they're not the entire story, and the show's second season is scheduled to debut in January 2026. However, if you can't wait that long, you can read ahead with the original Frieren manga. Volumes 1-13 have been localized to English and are available now, while Volume 14 is available to preorder at Amazon.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "In FBC: Firebreak, Corrupted Items can alter the way a Job unfolds in some chaotic ways, from reducing gravity to speeding up enemies or even forcing you into a game of \"red light, green light.\" Corrupted Items can make your life as a Firebreaker more painful than it needs to be. Luckily, you can (and usually should) destroy them with a tried-and-true method. Here's how to neutralize Firebreak Corrupted Items.Neutralize Corrupted Items in FBC: FirebreakIf you're playing a Job with Corrupted Items activated, you'll see a purple optional objective on the left side of the screen, under the main objective. This means somewhere--and it may be moving or stationary--you'll find a Corrupted Item. This item will create a gameplay modifier, most of which make your job harder to perform, so you'll want to prioritize removing that from the environment whenever you can.Find the Black Rock NeutralizerRegular guns and even your specialty items won't do the trick, however. Instead, you'll need a specific gun: the Black Rock Neutralizer. If there's a Corrupted Item on the map, one of these special guns will be found at an ammo station in the zone in which the item spawned. You'll want to seek out the ammo stations and find the one equipped with the Neutralizer.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Well, you can’t say Remedy don’t have range. After the screeching survival horror of Alan Wake 2 comes FBC: Firebreak, a three-person multiplayer FPS spun off from Wakeverse stablemate (and excellent action game in its own right) Control. Perspective isn’t the only thing that shifts, either, as Firebreak reframes Control’s eerie, New Weird-influenced setting as a backdrop for comedy co-op shenanigans. There will be gnomes creating lightning storms. Back in the Oldest House, the illogically vast and currently invaded headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Control, Firebreakers – volunteer office drones turned underqualified field agents – gear up to do battle with whatever outdated guns and jerry-rigged tools they can find. The Firebreak initiative is as haphazard and cobbled-together a task force as you’re likely to see, and ultimately, a reflection of the game it stars in: one that’s plucky and capable of impressing, yet never quite comes together as a cohesive prospect.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Do you care about Labubus? Nah, I just don’t get the hype. 2. What’s your favorite summer dessert? Hmm, all of them? If pressed to pick one, then ice cream. 3. Do you have plans for the Fourth of July yet? Connor will be dancing with her dance team in the town parade, so that’s our main event during the day. We’ll probably do a barbeque at home after the parade. Where we live doesn’t allow fireworks, so we may or may not go looking for a fireworks display. We’ll see how ambitious we’re feeling! 4. How do you feel about maxi dresses? If it’s in a petite size and the print isn’t too overwhelming, then I’ll rock a maxi dress, for sure. 5.
