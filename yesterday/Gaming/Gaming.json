    "description": "PC has continued to see more games releases from Sony and Microsoft, which, combined with all of the exclusives the platform gets, makes it a great place to play. While Nintendo is an exception, you're all but guaranteed to get the best of Xbox and PlayStation on this platform, and even without those console giants courting PC gamers, the year has been loaded with high-profile releases. According to GameSpot sister site Metacritic, the best-reviewed PC games--as of December 5--covered a wide variety of genres.From AAA releases to smash-hit indies, 2024 was a year where From Software released a masterpiece with its Elden Ring expansion, Animal Well took the world by storm with its engrossingly weird metroidvania magic, and Tactical Breach Wizards reminded the world that defenestration is always an option. We've rounded up all of the games below that received high metascores, and you can read more below. Be sure to also check out our running list of the best PC games to play right now.More Best Of 2024:Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024Best Xbox Games Of 2024Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024Best Of 2024 hub Elden Ring: Shadow of the ErdtreeIs it even possible to make one of the best games of all time even better? Shadow of the Erdtree positively answers that question with its gorgeous new location, breathtaking boss fights, and new gameplay ideas to create a new gold standard for future souls-like games to be measured against.Metascore: 94 | Read our Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review See at Fanatical   Metaphor ReFantazioWhat initially looked like it might be little more than a fantasy reskin of the Persona series proved to be much more. Metaphor: ReFantazio was named GameSpot's Game of the Year for 2024 and earned a rare 10/10, and for good reason: It evolves Persona's turn-based combat in interesting new ways to make for a phenomenal experience, and it pairs that with a compelling narrative that feels appropriate given the current-day political climate. It plays great on Steam Deck, too.Metascore: 92 | Read our Metaphor: ReFantazio review See at Fanatical   Tekken 8We're living in a golden age of fighting games, and after the arrival of Street Fighter 6 and Mortal Kombat 1 last year, it was time for an iron-fisted king to make a grand return. Tekken 8 doubles down on its strength, cementing its position as one of the Big Three in fighting games. Its gorgeous visuals pack a punch, new gameplay systems reward you for aggressively dishing out pain, and its single-player storyline is an entertaining clash between Tekken's most-entertaining personalities and several newcomers.Metascore: 90 | Read our Tekken 8 review See at Fanatical   UFO 50One of the most ambitious indie projects in years, UFO 50 imagines a fictional video game console and uncovers a whopping 50 games from it. The collection is a fantastically diverse set of retro-style games spanning the styles of genre conventions of the 1980s. It's a smart and savvy exploration of classic gaming tropes while also giving you a wide array of new games to sink your teeth into.Metascore: 91 | Read our UFO 50 review  Animal WellThe less you know about Animal Well, the better, as this hit indie game works best when you go in with as little information as possible. A cryptic metroidvania where you collect items that can be used to alter the environment in surprising ways, everything about Animal Well feels like an intricate piece of art. Don't let the lo-fi visuals and deceptively simplistic gameplay fool you, as this nonlinear game is a masterclass in suspense.Metascore: 91 | Read our Animal Well review  SatisfactoryAfter years in early access, Satisfactory finally released in full this year, and it's hard to argue it wasn't worth the wait. It's a game all about building automated systems, and in that regard, it's top-notch. When you're invoking a sense of satisfaction with your title, you had better deliver, and Satisfactory certainly does.Metascore: 91   BalatroBalatro has been one of the biggest surprises of the year, and as anyone who has played it can tell you, it's not hard to see why. Expertly blending its poker inspirations with roguelike deckbuilding gameplay, it's a game of endless possibility and captivating design that you can easily lose yourself in and play until the wee hours of the morning. Every card you pick up can drastically alter your chances for the better--or worse!--while a combination of synthwave music and psychedelic visuals help to create a hard-to-put-down flow to Balatro's magic.Metascore: 90 | Read our Balatro review See at Fanatical   Shin Megami Tensei V: VengeanceAtlus could have easily ported Shin Megami Tensei V, slapped on a new coat of paint, and called it a day, but the publisher decided to go above and beyond for what was expected of it. Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance shines on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC thanks to an absurd amount of extra content in this demon-hording adventure. It's also packed full of thoughtful quality-of-life tweaks, all adding to an already-engaging narrative that makes this challenging series worth jumping into for the first time or revisiting if you're looking to play the best version of it.Metascore: 87 | Read our Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance review See at Fanatical Thank Goodness You're HereThe beauty of Thank Goodness You're Here is that you never quite know what to expect from this adorable \"slapformer.\" In terms of gameplay, you're not doing much beyond steering a curiously small chap through various scenarios that can be solved with some percussive maintenance, and yet you'd be hard-pressed to find another game as memorable as this one.Metascore: 90 | Read our Thank Goodness You're Here review God of War RagnarokThe stream of first-party games from Sony, formerly exclusive to Playstation consoles, continued in 2024, and there aren't many better than God of War Ragnarok. The continuation of 2018's soft reboot told another great story filled with memorable characters and set pieces, and the action took another step forward with new tools and wrinkles to keep it feeling fresh. It might be a few years old, but like its predecessor, Ragnarok holds up exceptionally well.Metascore: 90 | Read our God of War Ragnarok review See at Fanatical   Like a Dragon: Infinite WealthLike a Dragon: Infinite Wealth hits a bullseye for what a sequel should be--bigger, bolder, and now with Danny Trejo playing a machete-themed villain. At the same time, Infinite Wealth is a wonderful passing of the torch, as it brings back old faces for one last ride. A polished and emotionally charged adventure, Ichiban's return will tug at your heart with its expertly crafted narrative and leave you with plenty to do after the end credits have rolled thanks to a surplus of extra content.Metascore: 89 | Read our Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth review See at Fanatical   Kill KnightSure, the name is funny (Kill Butt 2: 2, anyone?), but Kill Knight is also a gloriously stylish shooter that will remind you of legendary arcade games like Smash TV and Robotron 2084. It's all wrapped up in a hellish aesthetic that's decidedly darker and more grim than the aforementioned games, and in a sort of reverse-Doom situation, it's up to you to make angels extinct. You will not cry when angels deserve to die.Metascore: 88 See at Fanatical    Destiny 2: The Final ShapeThe Final Shape effectively took on the challenge of concluding the decade-long story of Destiny and helped to bring the game into its best, most interesting form yet. The RPG elements are more fully fleshed out than ever, and the new activities, compelling campaign, and dense Pale Heart location all make for a satisfying end to the Light and Darkness Saga. Though it's not the end of Destiny 2, which will continue on, it is undoubtedly a high point for the game.Metascore: 89 | Read our Destiny 2: The Final Shape review See at Fanatical   Horizon Forbidden West: Complete EditionHorizon Forbidden West launched a few years ago on PlayStation, and it finally made its way to PC in 2024. The second chapter in Aloy's journey sees her diving further into the technological conspiracy that caused the end of modern civilization, but with an added threat from a new group of people possessing seemingly unstoppable weapons of their own. Like the original, it features a mix of stealth and all-out action, both against other humans and the many \"breeds\" of robotic dinosaurs scattered across a devastated world.Metascore: 89 | Read our Horizon Forbidden West review See at Fanatical    Persona 3 ReloadPersona 3 defined with would become the formula that elevated the franchise to a new level of popularity. But elements of it aged poorly, and it also had never been available on PC. Reload makes it easy to jump into, with a good-looking PC version (that also runs well on Steam Deck) adding various quality-of-life improvements.Metascore: 89 | Read our Persona 3 Reload review See at Fanatical   Ghost of Tsushima: Director's CutAn open-world samurai game, Ghost of Tsushima presents a more approachable blend of stealth and action than souls-like-style games. It's got a gorgeous world to explore and wonderful cinematography to take in, all of it improved with the visual improvements you get on PC, plus additional content that was included with the Director's Cut release.Metascore: 89 | Read our Ghost of Tsushima review See at Fanatical   Lorelei and the Laser Eyes2024 might just go down as the best year ever for puzzle games, and at the top of the cerebral pile, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes stands strong. Imagine a game flexing an Italian cinema art direction, puzzles that'll make you reach for a notebook to keep track of everything, and surreal vibes, and you've got everything you need to enjoy a wonderfully weird mystery.Metascore: 88 | Read our Lorelei and the Laser Eyes review  Tactical Breach WizardsTactical Breach Wizards takes the basic gameplay concept of the brilliant Into the Breach--turn-based gameplay where you know your opponents' next move, and where you can manipulate their positioning to enable a better outcome--and dumps the roguelike structure for a story-based campaign. It's full of great writing and humor, and it also innovates with its gameplay by expanding the number of potential actions on each turn, making it so even complex levels can be solved in a single, ultra-satisfying turn.Metascore: 88 | Read our Tactical Breach Wizards review  Dragon's Dogma 2Dragon's Dogma 2 is a satisfying and rewarding jaunt into fantasy. Capcom's return to the series isn't flawless, but those imperfections are easy to live with once you become drawn into a vast world of possibility that is full of helpful Pawns, thrilling adventures, and combat that'll keep you on the edge of your seat.Metascore: 88 | Read our Dragon's Dogma 2 review See at Fanatical   Shogun ShowdownThis roguelike deckbuilder sets itself in feudal Japan, challenging you to take on enemy swordsmen with nothing but your wits and a deep, turn-based combat system. You'll carefully position your shogun and choose the perfect moment to strike, and as your runs progress, you'll unlock new characters and skills.Metascore: 88 See at Fanatical   The Crimson DiamondA throwback to the days of Sierra's MS-DOS point-and-click adventure games, The Crimson Diamond still manages to mix a few modern ideas into its old-school design. A murder-mystery full of devious puzzles to solve, this love-letter to text-parser games like the Laura Bow Mystery Series is a must-play for anyone looking for a return to the past.Metascore: 88   Mullet MadjackMullet Madjack is like a first-person take on Hotline Miami, blending the intensity of that game with a distinct, colorful art style and a satirical spin on streamer culture. You'll need to rush from kill to kill before your timer runs out, soaking in the bloody visuals and '80s-style soundtrack that make this an exhilarating experience.Metascore: 88   Five Nights at Freddy's: Into the PitCan a Five Nights at Freddy's game be just as terrifying in 2D as it is in its traditional 3D format? The answer is a resounding yes with Into the Pit, as this Five Nights spin-off looks gruesomely gorgeous with its pixel-art animation. Throw in dual timelines, signature Five Nights at Freddy's frights, and unsettling levels, and you've got a rock-solid spin-off.Metascore: 87   Crusader Kings III: Roads to PowerCrusader Kings III already gave players nearly endless ways to conquer the world, whether it be through careful diplomacy or assassinating a child and then staging a large-scale invasion. If you thought you've seen all Crusader Kings III has to offer, think again, because Roads to Power adds several new wrinkles via the Byzantine Empire. New governmental options, co-ruling, and less restrictive exploration all breathe new life into a brilliant do-evil simulator.Metascore: 87 See at Fanatical    Halls of TormentA Survivors-like that was already a worthy entry to the genre while it was in early access, Halls of Torment saw its 1.0 release in 2024. Its Diablo 2-style visuals evoke a certain era that will appeal to some, but its longer-term progression makes it hard not to opt into one more run whenever you finish one up.Metascore: 87   Minishoot AdventuresA Zelda-like adventure game by way of a shoot-em-up, Minishoot Adventures combines two very different genres and discovers they're like chocolate and peanut butter. The bullet hell mechanics feel right at home as you explore dungeons, find powerful new equipment, and take on enormous bosses.Metascore: 87   Silent Hill 2Bloober Team weathered many doubts for years as the team worked on Silent Hill 2. Players seemed to preorder their frustrations with the game. But then something funny happened: It launched, and it was exceptional. Both a faithful remake to an all-time great horror game and an experience that adds to the overall experience and even lore of Konami's best horror game, the Silent Hill 2 remake is arguably the best horror remake in a long line of them over the past several years.Metascore: 87 | Read our Silent Hill 2 review See at Fanatical   Dragon Quest III HD-2D RemakeJRPG fans have been spoiled for choice throughout the year, but Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake left an indelible mark with its nostalgic appeal and a visual overhaul that Square Enix excels at. While some archaic elements remain intact--and show just how far the genre has come since this game was first released--Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake is still a thrilling collection of turn-based battles and surprisingly flexible gameplay systems.Metascore: 87 | Read our Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake review  AntonblastAntonblast is a relentless platformer, one that plays like a 2D Crash Bandicoot with breathtaking anger-management issues. With a frantic pace, platforming that requires deft skill, and an art style that isn't exactly easy on the eyes, it can be a bit of an acquired taste. But if you're looking to cap the year off with high-energy platforming action featuring a protagonist with an undying rage that could put the Doomslayer to shame? Then you'll have a blast with Dynamite Anton in this game.Metascore: 87   Indiana Jones and the Great CircleThe best Indiana Jones game since the intrepid archeologist solved the fate of Atlantis, The Great Circle embodies the spirit of a cinematic icon with its big-budget presentation, scrappy combat, and puzzles that'll make you feel like you deserve a teaching post at Marshall College. Developer MachineGames did its homework with this Indiana Jones game, but more than that, the entire project feels like a labor of love that celebrates the character and his long-lasting impact on pop culture.Metacritic: 87 | Read our Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review  See at Fanatical Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.",

    "description": "This year, I decided I'd finally play 2022's Case of the Golden Idol, a mystery game that thrusts you onto the scene of a murder moments after it's happened. You pan through several screens, absorb every detail you possibly can, gather clues in the form of nouns and verbs, and make logic-based deductions by filling in the missing details in passages that tell the story of what occurred there. There are systems in place to guide you in the right direction, and the game begins quite simply, but by its end, I was being pushed to my absolute limit. The first few cases took all of about 10-25 minutes, but the final one in the game seemed to stretch across the span of an entire night. My head was positively bursting with possible motives and culprits, and kudos to Case of the Golden Idol for allowing me the room to be wrong about these cases until I eventually divined the right permutation of terms and cracked the case. It was one of the most frustrating ends of a game ever, and I was enamored of the whole experience.I bring up Case of the Golden Idol and this frustration because, overwhelmingly, many of 2024's best games provided me with that very same feeling. These stellar titles, like Animal Well, Rise of the Golden Idol, and Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, are composed of what seems like countless of the most nefarious and confounding puzzles I've come across, some of which still vex and evade me to this day. And yet, despite that recurring headache--brought on by slamming my head into a proverbial wall over and over again--I wouldn't trade the experiences I had with them for anything.I was wrong a lot in Rise of the Golden Idol, 2024's sequel to the aforementioned Case. I frequently confused names and aliases, and as the levels grew in scale (and the scenarios grew in complexity), I missed a lot of smaller details in the immaculately rendered environs that had been planted to provide insight and direction. I misunderstood the events of the game on numerous occasions, and was more surprised than usual at the revelations that were revealed by a level's end. Rise of the Golden Idol was thoroughly frustrating, and yet it's clearly one of the best games I've played all year because when I pushed it, it pushed back.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Who would you rather go dancing with: your significant other, your best friend or your kid (if you have one)? Honestly, I’d love to go with Connor, LOL! 2. Spa weekend or a music festival weekend? Spa weekend, 100%. 3. Have you had any eggnog this holiday season? Nope, none! I don’t really crave it, but if it’s there, I’ll have a small cup. 4. Who would you rather have lunch with: your favorite musician, your favorite actor, your favorite author or your favorite teacher? Honestly, if she was still alive, lunch with my favorite teacher from elementary would be lovely. The last time I saw her, I was 18. 5. Do you pop the zit or leave it alone? I dunno, how ripe is it?

    "description": "This was an exciting time of year for Tabs. Company coming over, trees INSIDE the house, blinking lights, the biggest turkeys of the year — for a cat like Tabs, the holidays were a cat cornucopia of comfy couches, fragrant foliage, tinsel, tasty treats and plump plumage. As the head of the decorating committee for Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC, Tabs was responsible for the Christmas tree decorations, and I just sort of did what he said. Normally, it would go down something like this: first week of December, and he hadn’t decided on the overall theme yet, but he’d have it narrowed down to something like baked red, green and silver catnip crispy ornament treats or strings of classic white lights and red Christmas balls. Probably. But he wouldn’t be sure yet. Whichever way it went, he always got a lot of help. The decorating committee was always on standby and awaiting orders. And Tabs? Well, he was always late because of this or that. A lot of the time it was just because[Continue reading...] The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 842 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
