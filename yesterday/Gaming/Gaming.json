    "description": "Fortnite's roster of streamers who have skins in the item shop just got a little bigger with the addition of Cody \"Clix\" Conrod, who, at 19 years old, will be one of the youngest people ever to have a Fortnite skin based on them. Along with the new Clix skin, there will be a full slate of Clix-related cosmetics and, in a first for this sort of thing, a Clix-themed remix of an existing skin.Clix, for those who aren't familiar, made a name for himself by earning a spot in the Fortnite World Cup in 2019 when he was just 14 years old. And while he continues to compete at the highest levels, he's also become a popular streamer and personality, which is how he's landed his very own Fortnite skin.Clix's slate of cosmetics will include a single skin that comes with two distinctive styles based on a meme you probably know even if he's new to you--one in which he's sporting a t-shirt and pajama pants, and another in which he's wearing a suit and tie. In addition to the skin, Clix's set includes two back blings, two emotes, a wrap, and a pickaxe.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What eye makeup products have been on repeat with you lately? Maybelline Lash Sensational Sky High Mascara (eh, it’s just OK), Stila Liquid Liner Micro Tip (it’s pretty good) and good ol’ Anastasia Brow Pencil. 2. How good are you about finding clothes that fit you well? I used to be OK at it, but now, I don’t really enjoy in-person shopping as much as I used to, so I don’t spend the time that one really needs to find the things that fit great. There’s always something a little off with my clothes and I just kinda live with it. Blergh! On the bright side, at least my outfit is always ironed and somewhat matching. 3. How good are you about resisting impulse purchases?

That might be why he liked holidays so much — because they were an opportunity to play Santa “Claws,” so to speak, and spread good tidings to everyone. Perhaps for the obvious reasons, St. Patrick’s Day was a fave. Obviously, with those gorgeous green eyes, he loved the color scheme. ☘️ And then, of course, the gold… He was also a big fan of that. 😊 Rosie has her own reasons for celebrating St. Paddy’s Day. For starter’s, alchemy… In fact, she did her PhD dissertation in turning lead into gold through targeted meows in the ultra-low frequency range, the so-called “smoker’s meow” spectrum. Marnie, however, did not get the memo regarding St. Patrick’s Day this year. Or rather, she did get the memo, but she didn’t read it.
