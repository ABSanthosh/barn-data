Playing it could feel like giving someone made entirely of elbows a hug. You'd get used to it in time - you'd even come to find the feeling comforting - but there's no question the series could use an update. Path of Exile 1 is over a decade old; it's time for something new. Read more",

    "description": "Remember the massive passive skill tree in Path of Exile? Well, it's back in Path of Exile 2, offering over a thousand nodes for you to lose your mind over. If you're a newcomer to Path of Exile, the passive skill tree has plenty of branching paths to choose from. Depending on which character class you pick, you'll start at a different place of the tree. From there, you're free to take whichever direction you want following the established paths, which adds to the experimentation element around builds.As you might expect, it's hard to commit to a path over others, especially if you feel like your current build is lacking on certain resistances or attributes halfway through the game. That's when respeccing comes in. If you're wondering how to respec passive skills in Path of Exile 2, there are a few steps and considerations to keep in mind, which we'll detail below.How to respec passive skills in Path of Exile 2Don't worry if you spend your first few hours in Path of Exile 2 without being able to respec passive skills, as that's by design.

Both (the best Final Fantasy game) Final Fantasy 8’s Squall and The Witcher 3’s Geralt simply cannot get enough of leaving their friends and the entire world in mortal peril while they sneak in a quick round of cards, and I love them for it. Way back when the Wild Hunt released, there was a special edition kicking about that gave you a few decks for Gwent - the fleshed-out, playable card distraction that ended up being responsible for some of the game’s best moments. I pined for those decks, but I never acquired them. Now, Hatchette Board Games is putting out a full physical edition of Gwent next year. The set contains \"over 400 cards and a playmat\" for £44/$39.99. I’m still recovering from various Fantasy Flight LCGs, so my value sense for this stuff might be a bit skewed, but that strikes me as incredibly reasonable. A good Gwent deck consists of only about 25 cards. They’re not bad cards, either! I’ve got a real pet hate for tabletop versions of videogames that just use in-engine screenshots for the cards, but these ones look to have the proper artwork from the game on them: Read more",

    "description": "Where were you during the Summer of Doronko Wanko? Why, I remember it like it was March, and not actually Summer, when the delightful free game about a mucky pomeranian was unleashed into the world. Yep, yep. It was definitely March. Roughly translating to ‘covered in mud doggy’, the game set you the task of racking up tangible financial damage to your owner’s house by getting mud everywhere - first by normal dog means, and then with giant mud cannons. You can grab it for free on Steam here. It stole our hearts, it did. And talking of stealing things and having a good time doing it, it’s also releasing on the Nintendo Switch soon, which means the Steam version of Doronko Wanko is getting some free DLC to celebrate. It isn’t arriving until next Spring, but it’s bringing three new mystery dog breeds with it when it does. Read more",

You know, MAC Club eyeshadow? Of course you do. It’s a classic. Last week, out of nowhere, I thought to myself, “I really need to wear Club.” It’s been years since I’ve wanted to deal with complicated eye makeup, but I got the urge, so I went with it. My makeup collection is pretty barren compared to the thick of MBB’s beauty blogging days, but I’ve held on to this ancient Monster’s Bride palette from —I don’t even wanna say the year. LOL! I’ve always loved the shadows, especially Club. I took a little bit of Club, popped it on my lids and smoothed out the edges with a fluffy brush dipped in face powder. Oh, and this[Continue reading...] The post A Little Bit of MAC Club appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. A habit that changed your life? Getting up early. For most of my life I was a night owl, and when I had Connor that all changed. When she was an infant, I started waking up at the crack of dawn to sneak in work before she woke up in the morning. The habit ended up sticking, and now I’m an early bird. 2. Fruit or cupcakes? As much as I love a small cake smothered in frosting, I’m gonna have to go with fruit. 3. Are you doing any advent calendars this year? At Trader Joe’s a couple weeks ago, I picked up a few for the “kids” – Connor, Rosie and Marnie. Ha ha ha! 4. Something on your Christmas list? Honestly, I have no[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 859 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
