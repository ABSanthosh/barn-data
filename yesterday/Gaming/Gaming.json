NeoGrip and StandGrip. Skull \u0026 Co. is one of the most popular Switch accessory manufacturers, and the new Switch 2 versions of the NeoGrip and StandGrip are sure to be popular--in fact, at least one bundle deal featuring the NeoGrip for Switch 2 and one of its new carrying cases has already sold out at Amazon. Luckily, you can still grab the Switch 2 NeoGrip for $30 and StandGrip for $19 (was $27), along with several other new Switch 2 accessories from Skull \u0026 Co. like carrying cases, screen protectors, and protective caps for the Switch 2's thumbsticks and buttons.All Skull \u0026 Co.

It features a hard, durable construction to absorb the impact of falls. It's designed so you can use the Switch 2's kickstand and dock while it's attached to the console and won't block the game card slot, vents, or buttons, but can easily slide on and off if needed.The NeoGrip for Switch 2 is available in Black or Neon Red and Blue. Amazon also lists a bundle featuring the Maxcarry case, though it's currently sold out.NeoGrip for Switch 2NeoGrip For Switch 2 (Neon Red and Blue) -- $30NeoGrip For Switch 2 (Black) -- $30NeoGrip For Switch 2 and Carrying Bundle (Black) -- $50 (Sold Out)NeoGrip For Switch 2 and Carrying Bundle (Neon Red and Blue) -- $50 (Sold Out) See at Amazon StandGrip for Switch 2 $19 (was $27) The StandGrip for Nintendo Switch 2 is a wrap-around case with soft, protective material with a textured finish to keep the Switch 2 safe and make it more comfortable to hold.

The hard inner case is surrounded by a denim covering, and it features an adjustable hand strap. It's large enough to fit the undocked Switch 2 with the Joy-Con 2s attached, but not much else. See at Amazon Maxcarry Case $30 (was $50) Skull \u0026 Co.'s Switch 2 Maxcarry Case is a larger alternative to the Slim Carrying Case. It features similar durable construction but offers more internal storage space for accessories or for fitting the Switch 2 with either the NeoGrip or StandGrip attachments. See at Amazon If you're looking for more Switch 2 accessories, other third-party brands like JSAUX, Tomtoc, Satisfye, and Dbrand all have their own grips, carrying cases, and screen protectors available. We've rounded up some of our favorite Switch 2 grips in the list below.Beyond grips, GameStop has its own line of budget-friendly Switch 2 accessories available.

Sid Meier's Civilization VII - Switch 2 Edition $70 | Releases June 5 This is the only physical version of Sid Meier's Civilization VII available for Switch 2. As mentioned above, this includes a download code for the game--specifically the Switch edition of the game and the Switch 2 Edition upgrade.

It also features enhanced visuals with up to 4K resolution at 30fps or 1080p at 60fps when docked. Preorder at Amazon Note that anyone who already owns the physical or digital versions of Civilization on the original Switch can also upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition for $10 via the Switch 2 eShop.

This feudal-flavoured first-person frenzy promises revamped combat and revitalized visuals for current-gen consoles and PCs. In broad strokes, this is a strong technical success but how well does the game play out across PS5, PS5 Pro, Xbox Series X and especially the horsepower-challenged Xbox Series S? In all cases, users are getting a good experience, but the premium Xbox console seems to get the smoothest experience overall - even compared to PS5 Pro - while the junior Xbox is still recognisably the same game, but with very low rendering resolutions and a haircut to some visual features.

This led to a launch delay last week and then, the abrupt announcement that La Quimera would start out as an early access project. Read more",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Pick how much ice you’d like in your drink: all the way to the brim, half full, a few cubes or no ice at all? Half full, please. That’s purr-fect! 2. Have you ever raised a puppy or a kitten? Yes. It’s a wonderful experience, but be prepared to have your nice things destroyed! Oh, and you can forget about your couch ever looking pristine again. 3. How often do you hit the snooze button in the morning? Just once. I used to just get up when the alarm went right off, but lately, eh, I’ve been loving a little extra sleep. 4. What decade has the best clothes? I’m probably biased because I wish I could go back to 1998 at least once a day, but[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 877 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

What sports would you have liked to have played as a kid? I would’ve loved to have taken dance classes. I think I would’ve enjoyed soccer, too. 2. Would you rather listen to the radio or replay a favorite album? Replay a favorite album. Speaking of that, my family will probably freak out if I play the greatest hits from Fleetwood Mac one more time. 3. Have you ever had a job where you had to be on your feet all day? Yup. I’ve done retail and worked in the back of the house in a bakery. Gotta have supportive shoes! 4. Do you have any travel plans for the summer? Right now we’ve got one camping trip to the Russian River planned, and that’s it.
