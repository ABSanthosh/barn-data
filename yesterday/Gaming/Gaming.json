    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Stuffing or mashed potatoes? Both speak volumes to my carb-loving heart, but I love mashed potatoes just a little bit more. 2. Apple pie or apple cider? Um, both? 3. Do you have any Thanksgiving day traditions? Not really, although I do short circuit if I don’t get at least one slice of pecan pie. I gotta have it! 4. Have you ever hosted Thanksgiving? Yes, a handful of times, and yes, there was pecan pie. HAHAHA! 5. Something you’re thankful for? So thankful to spend time with my little family of El Hub, Connor, Rosie and Marnie. Our house is full and so is my heart! Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S. Here are the questions to copy/paste with your answers in a comment.

    "description": "As most people know, Tabs was a demanding employer. He was also very fair to his employees. More than generous, actually. In keeping with his holiday traditions, Rosie allowed us to take the next two weeks off (thank you so much, Rosie!). Consequently, the employees of Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC have been up to their vacation shenanigans, which for me meant blogging while dressed up as a cat lady lumberjack. Makeup, of course, has been on Connor’s agenda, but she’s still perfecting her technique… Marnie has been cruisin’ the streets of Novato looking for tiny dogs with short legs to bark at — that is, when Connor isn’t demanding that they play dress-up together. We’ve all been enjoying this joyful break before Thanksgiving. I hope things are going well with you, too. We’re here and we’re feisty (just tired). 😊 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 839 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
