    "description": "AMD announced its latest graphics card, the Radeon RX 9060 X, at Computex 2025 earlier this week. This is the third GPU in AMD's 9000 series lineup that also includes the RX 9070 and 9070 XT, and its slated to launch June 5. While it's positioned as the entry-level option in the RX 9000 series, the RX 9060 XT runs on the same RNDA 4 architecture as the more powerful RX 9070 and 9070 XT and includes FSR 4 resolution upscaling and frame generation, as well as DisplayPort 2.1a and HDMI 2.1b support. AMD is producing two versions of the RX 9060 XT: one with 8GB VRAM and another with 16GB VRAM. Both models will feature 32 RDNA 4 CUs (computation units), up to 3.13GHz clock speed, and between 150W and 182W power draw, depending on the model's VRAM and clock speed. While those are solid specs for an entry-level card, things get a bit more confusing from there.Power and pricingAMD lists the MSRP as $300 for the 8GB model and $350 for the 16GB model. However, the company is not releasing RX 9060 XT reference cards itself. Instead, third-party manufacturers like Asus, Acer, Gigabyte, and others are launching their own versions of the RX 9060 XT starting June 5. As such, performance, power draw, and pricing will likely differ between the various RX 9060 XT models (especially for overclocked models), but at least some of these GPUs will stick to the reference clock speeds and therefore MSRP (assuming the ongoing tariffs do not impact those prices).Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "There are a lot of different jobs to choose from in The Sims 4, including a pretty robust group of careers included with the base game and plenty more that have been added via DLC over the decade-plus that The Sims 4 has been out. What jobs you have your sims sign up for is totally up to you, but there are a lot of factors that can affect your performance, like whether your sim's skills are appropriate for the job you want. If you want your sims to be successful, some knowledge and effort are required--just like it is with a real job.While there are specific things you'll need to know about each individual career that can help you get ahead, there are also some universal tips that can help your sims climb their corporate ladders.Table of Contents [hide]General tips for any Sims 4 careerPick an active, self-employment, or rabbit hole jobGeneral tips for any Sims 4 careerPick an active, self-employment, or rabbit hole jobThere are three main types of careers in The Sims 4. Most of them are rabbit hole-type jobs, where your sims just go offscreen and do their thing without any meaningful input from the player. But there are also \"active\" careers, where you follow your sim to their place of business and you'll have to make them do various tasks (though you can also play these as rabbit hole jobs if you'd prefer), and self-employment and freelance careers where your sim will complete individual gigs from the comfort of their homes, like writing a book, painting a picture, or building furniture.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What did you have for breakfast? Protein smoothie with whey protein powder, greek yogurt, unsweetened almond milk and fruit (apples and strawberries). It’s easy, doesn’t require turning on the stove and it keeps me full for hours. 2. How did you do your hair today? I’m wearing it down, with soft, barely there waves. Kinda boring but it’s practical for me because it takes about five minutes to style. Plus wearing it down helps with the migraines (I get bad ones). 3. What’s your favorite summer month? June. It’s the end of the school year, and you feel like the whole summer is ahead of you! It’s also warm but not too hot yet. Oh, and it’s my birthday month, too. Yay, to all my cray-cray geminis![Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 879 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Crisis between colleagues! Today, a special meeting of the Board of Directors of Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC was called to review a most disturbing matter — the repeated and inexplicable disappearance of Chief Feline Officer Rosie’s crunchies. At various times over the past few weeks, Rosie’s food bowl, which had been previously full, has become empty, and as you can imagine, this caused quite a corporate kerfuffle. The results of an internal investigation were inconclusive, but Rosie thinks she knows who’s doing it… Since the official investigation was inconclusive, the board hasn’t taken any action, but Rosie’s suspicions have created a lot of tension… Unfortunately for Marnie, she has a lengthy record of snack theft, so her history isn’t doing her any favors. Plus, she was captured on security footage early this morning in the vicinity of Rosie’s food bowl. When asked about it by the company investigator, Marnie lawyered up… I just hope this gets resolved soon because it’s been bad for morale in the office. 🙂 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 861 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
