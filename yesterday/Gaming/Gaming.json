The sale includes numerous popular board games for huge discounts, so you'll definitely want to check out the full list, but the one caught our attention was Star Wars Villainous, Ravensburger's popular strategy game that places players in the shoes of iconic characters from the dark side of the Force. Star Wars Villainous: Power of the Dark Side is available for only $15. Get Star Wars Villainous Deal Star Wars Villainous sells for $30-$40, though it carries an MSRP of $50.

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Last show you binged watched? “The Diplomat” season 2 on Netflix with Keri Russell. It’s a little silly but I like how they weave real things that happen in the world into it. 2. Have you started planning for Thanksgiving yet? Girl, no. LOL! I barely made it through the Halloween season, which honestly felt like it was three years long. I know in a few years, when Connor’s older, I’ll miss all the activities. Anyway, for Thanksgiving, we’re invited to a dinner that a friend is hosting, so we’ll probably do that. Or, we’ll just stay at home in our jammies, watch movies and have a crab fest again. So fun! 3. Pick your fall nail color – red, burgundy or dark blue? Ooh, burgundy please![Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 855 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Last year Harris, that dastardly lothario, won the annual Novato pumpkin growing contest, which came as a huge shock to Rosie because she thinks he’s mentally inferior. While that may be true, Harris has figured out how to grow big pumpkins. This year, Rosie isn’t holding back. She’s put a lot of time and scientific work into maximizing her pumpkin yields. She also read a bunch of books on botany and interviewed all the top minds in the field. Hopefully she can reclaim the crown that Tabs once had. 😸 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 836 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
