    "description": "Fortnite's annual Halloween event, Fortnitemares, is back for 2024, bringing a host of new character skins, some wild new horror-themed weapons, and many other tricks and treats. As always, Fornitemares has start and end dates to be mindful of, because anything within this article that interests you will go away once the event ends. Make sure to jump into the game and smash some pumpkins before the decorations come down.Most importantly, this includes the Fortnitemares 2024 challenges, which we've previewed below. You'll earn not just a bunch of XP for completing these, but several free rewards, too. Keep scrolling to learn about everything Fortnitemares 2024 has to offer, or use these bookmarks to jump to your favorite parts of the event.Fortnitemares 2024 start and end datesFortnitemares 2024 challenges and rewardsFortnitemares 2024 SkinsHorde Rush PvE mode returnsSymbiote Cup - win free Marvel skins Fortnitemares 2024 start and end datesThe Fortnite Halloween party can't go on forever. It starts today, October 11, and runs straight through Halloween. While Epic didn't mention a specific end date, that's likely because the event concludes along with the season on November 2, but that's a date in itself that the team hasn't been talking about yet.We can only infer this based on when the battle pass expires according to information in the game. In any case, the event isn't going to end sooner than Halloween, so you have about three weeks to do everything you want to do. Fortnitemares 2024 challenges and rewardsAs always, you don't need to spend a single V-Buck to unlock some spooky new items. This year, you can unlock at least 11 rewards just by completing Fortnitemares quests. Though the full challenge list isn't available yet, you can find the order of unlockable items below, with images for several of those items above.Complete 1 Quest: The Fangler BassComplete 2 Quests: Carver's Helm EmoticonComplete 3 Quests: Horde's War Wheel Back BlingComplete 4 Quests: Thrills \u0026 Chills Loading ScreenComplete 5 Quests: Nightmare's Choice Jam TrackComplete 6 Quests: Knight of the Patch Banner IconComplete 7 Quests: Jack-o'-Drifter ContrailComplete 8 Quests: Fiendish Wand PickaxeComplete 9 Quests: Cauldron Chill EmoteComplete 10 Quests: Night of the Nitemares Loading ScreenComplete 11 Quests: The Great Scarecrow GliderThere will be more than 11 challenges in the event, so you won't need to clean the slate of them, but you'll need to complete most of them if you want to earn all of these items. Fortnitemares 2024 weapons and lootThe Fortnite Halloween party always adds a few spooky weapons and items. This year is doing the same, though it's also adding a few new weapons to the loot pool, and they're some of the game's most intense items yet. Here's all the Fortnitemares loot you can expect to find during the event:Wood Stake ShotgunPumpkin LauncherWitch BroomBoom BillyChainsawFortnitemares veterans will be familiar with those first three, though the last two are new to everyone. Boom Billy sends a Billy The Puppet, from Saw, tricycling toward the enemy before he detonates with an explosion. If you hear his twisted laugh, run away fast.Meanwhile, a chainsaw is also coming to the game, and it has both offensive and traversal capabilities. You can lunge at an enemy with it, or rev it into the ground, which will then propel you forward. It sounds like it could join the community's list cool traversal items, like the Shockwave Hammer, Kinetic Blade, and Spider-Man's Web Slingers.Though it isn't exactly a loot item, there's also a new on-island event you'll see during Fortnitemares. Interact with a Billy The Puppet TV across various places on the island and you'll be given a target to eliminate among players who have also opted into the challenge.Both players will be clad in bear masks from Saw, and if neither player (or squad) eliminates their target before the timer goes off, well, they both explode. Those who win the showdown will be gifted with a Boom Billy and a Witch Broom, among other randomized loot.*cue creepy Saw music and moralizing monologue* Fortnitemares 2024 SkinsThe rest of this article will highlight all the new skins coming during Fortnitemares. It's easily the busiest shop cycle the game's ever had for a single event, and even if you keep up with Fortnite leaks, we expect you'll see one or two in here you didn't know about.You've maybe already been introduced to the new Billy The Puppet skin, from Lionsgate's Saw franchise, as he came to the game earlier this week. Check out the rest below, including Disney and Marvel villains, Halloween favorites, and horror legends. Sally And The Pumpkin King Skins - A Nightmare Before Christmas Edward Scissorhands Skin Disney Villains Skins - Maleficent, Captain Hook, and Cruella De Vil Mephisto Skin - Marvel Comics Leatherface Skin - The Texas Chain Saw Massacre Agony and She-Venom - Marvel Comics Horde Rush PvE mode returnsNow an annual staple, Horde Rush mode is coming back. This limited-time mode sees you and three others teaming up against waves of enemies, culminating with massive cube monsters needing to be taken down.It will also have its own list of challenges, so be on the lookout for more ways to earn XP in this mode as we near the end of Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4. Symbiote CupLastly, though these skins will come to the Fortnite item shop over the next few weeks, you can compete to earn She-Venom and Agony earlier than their shop debuts--and if you do it, they'll be free, too.The Symbiote Cup is an upcoming Fortnite duos tournament taking place in-game on October 24 at 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET. Check out the tourney's official rules for the full details on how you and a buddy can win free Fortnite Marvel skins.",

    "description": "Thronefall is a pleasant, minimalist mashup of tower defence and strategy, in which you build up a base during the day then defend it from monstrous hordes at night. It launched in Early Access in August last year and has been wooing people with its cool colour palette ever since. Now it's hit 1.0. Read more",

    "description": "Hey, hey Saturday! I’m still around, and I’m still alive, and I’m still wearing Candy Yum Yum lipstick by MAC! I found it last week while I was rooting around inside a makeup drawer and decided that even though it’s fall, hot pink is still wildly appropriate for the season, ha ha ha! I’m just realizing right now that I’ve yet to wear any dark, rich and cozy wine, burgundy, brown, garnet or red fall lip colors, hmm. In fact, my lipstick game has been pretty MIA for a while now. Still, I gotta give props to myself and to all the makeup lovers out there who are doing a decent job filling in brows, curling lashes and basically doing the bare minimum to look somewhat undead. LOL! It’s funny to me that I haven’t really been wearing anything on my lips because lipstick and gloss are usually my favorite part of the makeup process. Lately, I’ll paint on some base and blush and whatever else I have time for in the mornings, and by[Continue reading...] The post Life Lately: Candy Yum Yum | Breakfast Cheese and Fruit | Lipstick Challenge for Next Week? appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Last person who complimented you on your makeup? My coworker last week. I was wearing a little more coverage than usual, so I think the overall look was more polished than the bare bones FOTDs I’ve been wearing for months now. Amazing what a difference a little bit of concealer makes! 2. Last dream you can remember? Marnie and I were like the Scooby Doo detectives in our neighborhood, ha ha ha! We were working a case to unveil who had stolen all the tuna sandwiches in our circle. 3. Today the temperature in my neighborhood is/was ____. The Bay Area is experiencing a heat wave, ugh! It’s supposed to hit 94. I’m so over it. 4. Your cookie of choice? Lately I’ve been obsessed with snickerdoodles.[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 851 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Like a lot of Unreal Engine 5 games, Silent Hill 2 stutters and it stutters a lot. Why is it happening? Can it be fixed? Looking for answers on this, I found myself tumbling down a rabbit hole, with this game - and others based on Unreal Engine 5 - presenting issues even more concerning than big lurches on the frame-time graph. Shader compilation stutter? That's not an issue in Silent Hill 2. Traversal stutter? Well, unfortunately that is - and it's highly problematic. However, similar to Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, there's also animation stutter. Even if you manage to stabilise performance, it's still impossible to enjoy a smooth, consistent experience in Silent Hill 2. We have some idea of why it's happening and even a highly makeshift solution, but even so, UE5 continues to present issues that continue to pile up as game after game falls foul of them. Read more",

    "description": "While the world waits, and waits, for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, a sequel that only ever seems further away - can you believe it was once scheduled for 2020? - I'm reminded of a vampire role-playing game that nearly passed me by. One of similar size and similar tone: thoughtful, brooding, dark. A game about drinking blood to sustain yourself and fighting demons, yes, but also about deciding what kind of vampire you want to be, and what kinds of morals you, as an undead being, want to have.
