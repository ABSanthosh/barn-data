    "description": "A new Resident Evil movie is in the works, and there's reportedly a bidding war underway among four major studios to land it. That's because the upcoming Resident Evil reboot already has Barbarian helmer Zach Cregger attached to write and direct the film.According to The Hollywood Reporter, Cregger's Resident Evil is described as \"a revamp that will take the title to its horror roots and be more faithful to the initial games.\" That would be nice change of pace from the previous Resident Evil films. The most recent adaptation, 2021's Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City, attempted to adapt the first two games in a single film, but it did very poorly in theaters. The six Resident Evil movies that came before that were largely focused on Milla Jovovich's Alice, a character who was created for the films. To date, there hasn't been a live-action Resident Evil film that truly captured the spirit of the games.Sony's Screen Gems distributed all of the previous Resident Evil movies, but the rights to this one are up for grabs because Cregger has some box office clout. Barbarian was critically acclaimed and a cult hit, while his second horror movie, Weapons, is said to have very high screen-test scores, though it's yet to debut publicly.

    "description": "2025 marks the 30th anniversary of Catan, and the tabletop game is set to get its sixth edition this April. This is the first update to the settler-oriented multiplayer board game in about a decade, with the fifth edition--the version that transformed the name of the game from The Settlers of Catan to just Catan--releasing in June 2015. As the game celebrates its 30th birthday, the designers are hoping to maintain the game's place as a major go-to onramp for people discovering the joy of playing tabletop games.\"How do you keep an old game relevant even after 30 years, right? Especially when gaming has developed,\" managing director and game designer Benjamin Teuber told me. \"The hobby continues to develop and grow, and there are so many great games. Every year, I have three new favorite games, and next year there [will be] three more and that's awesome, that's beautiful. But there is apparently still something to Catan because we still have very good sales numbers. ...There are always new people joining this hobby, and Catan still seems to be the entry level product, [the game] for many to find.\"The artwork for Catan Sixth Edition is far more vibrant than previous editions.For Teuber, it doesn't matter that Catan is 30 years old. Even if many who tried the game and loved it may eventually move on to more complex or niche tabletop systems, Catan is going to keep being a new experience for someone. Teuber told me a story about how Village Romance developer Michael Palm recently messaged him about playing Catan with his kid, who screamed, \"Klaus Teuber is the coolest game developer!\" during the game (Klaus is Benjamin's father and the creator of Catan).Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Mountains or desert? Mountains, ideally somewhere with a million shades of green and a river or a lake. Sure, my allergies will probably be crazy, but at least my heart will be happy. 2. Something you’re doing in 2025? Making decisions from a place of optimism and not fear. So often I needlessly worry about all the things that are involved and every little detail that could go wrong. I don’t want to be held back by fear anymore. Life is too short. 3. How easily do you cry? I’m 100% a crybaby. You know what, though? It’s not always because I’m sad. If I’m angry or frustrated or feeling anxious, my body releases whatever it needs to release through tears.

    "description": "Thank you for being a friend. Guess who just discovered The Golden Girls? When she’s not doing science, Rosie’s been watching reruns of one of my favorite shows ever. Now she’s trying to get Marnie into her little Golden Girls gang because Rosie’s obsessed with them. Marnie’s kinda into it, but to be honest, I don’t really think she knows what’s going on. 😹 Rosie is Sophia, and Marnie is Rose from St. Olaf (obviously). To complete the group, Rosie has been trying to find a good Dorothy and Blanche. She put something up on Nextdoor this morning, but she doesn’t have a lot of faith in the cats in the neighborhood. Do you happen to know any cats or dogs who’d fit the bill?
