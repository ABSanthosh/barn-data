    "description": "When you think back to every Indiana Jones movie, at one point or another Indy has had to be stealthy. Whether it's donning a disguise in The Last Crusade to get his father’s Holy Grail diary back, or sneaking onto a submarine to follow the Ark when it slipped out of his grasp, there's always a time he needs to be silent and sneaky - though whether Indy actually pulls this off without being caught is another matter entirely. He's not always the subtlest of human beings, which is precisely one of the reasons I feel stealth in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle works so well. Read more",

    "description": "Black Myth Wukong was a phenomenon. The UE5-powered action epic sold millions of copies when it launched earlier this year, impressing with its fast gameplay and sophisticated visuals. However, its configuration on PS5 left something to be desired, employing bizarre frame-rate locks and frame generation with a 30fps base frame-rate. Developer Game Science has addressed at least some of those issues as of the latest patch - and the studio has also added PS5 Pro support, using PSSR to improve image quality for Pro players. So is the console version finally in reasonable shape? And should we expect any issues from the Pro upgrade? Read more",

    "description": "Diablo 4 did huge numbers when it was released in June 2023, with positive reviews, impressive sales numbers, and over 12 million players. But for those who finished the game's campaign and dove into its endgame content, the real meat of an ARPG like Diablo, it was clear something was amiss.Item progression was frustrating and often felt like a chore. There were few endgame activities and little reason to do them. Seasonal updates added new mechanics and smaller fixes but didn't solve the underlying structural issues players had with the latest entry in Blizzard's legendary loot-chasing franchise. It carried echoes of Diablo 3's 2012 launch, when players quickly became frustrated by its endgame loop (and its real-money auction house). Was Blizzard repeating the same mistake twice?What a difference a year makes. Whereas it took around two years for Diablo 3 to become great with the addition of its Reaper of Souls expansion, Diablo 4 today is vastly improved to the one of last year or even just seven months ago. Whereas I quickly fell off Diablo 4's endgame loot grind at launch, I'm now hooked thanks to free updates that overhauled itemization and revamped its difficulty. Diablo 4's endgame loop is now extremely satisfying, and I'm continuing to chase those smaller upgrades and highly coveted Mythic Unique items that could take my character ever slightly further--something that felt like a fool's errand a year ago.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Hello, my friend. Merry Christmas to you! I hope that today you’re feeling loved, calm and joyful. We got back from Hawaii a couple days ago, and it’s been a whirlwind of cookie baking, card writing and gift delivering so far. I still feel the aloha sprit in my heart, though, and it’s keeping me warm and cozy in this chilly Bay Area day. How have your holidays been so far? I feel like mine flew by in the blink of an eye. Although I wanted to do so much more for everyone in my life, I’ve realized that at a certain point one just needs to accept that there’s only so many hours in the day and so much energy to go around, and you can only do the best you can. It’s truly been a season of grace on this end of the keyboard. Grace for myself, and grace for others.

    "description": "How’s your Christmas shopping coming along? I hope you aren’t having to brave the crowds in these last couple days. Have I ever told you that one of my least favorite things on Earth — ON EARTH — is parking lots at Christmas? Not. A. Fan. Man, the Costco parking lot by my house? Or, rather, any Costco parking lot in any town in America at Christmas? How can it take 20 minutes for my car to move 20 feet? Ladybugs on the ground are passing my car. A snail that hitched a ride on my car overnight literally climbed back down to the road because it knew it could go faster. 😂 But I digress… Tabs loved Christmases, but it was easy for him because he was the boss, whereas I’m the one who had to do all the jobs.
