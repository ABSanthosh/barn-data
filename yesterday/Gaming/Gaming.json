    "description": "In WWE 2K25's new Island mode, you'll explore an open-world PvPvE hub full of shops, events, and other players. But one thing you might lose track of is how to change your character's appearance in The Island. In our brief guide, we'll walk you through how to do just that, so your future WWE superstar can look just the way you want them to. Better yet, this same method we'll show you also lets you adjust their moveset to your liking.How to customize your character's appearance and moves in WWE 2K25 The IslandThere's only one way to change what your character looks like in The Island, since it's a mode split off from your library of create-a-wrestlers (CAWs) and your MyRise story mode superstar. When you create your Island character, the game might usher you right past the customization suite, leaving you to need to get back to it after some brief onboarding into the new mode.Once you can freely explore the Island, you'll want to look for a pathway between the pink-colored barber shop and the Nike and Jordan stores. Down that way, you'll see an elaborate building decorated with Cody Rhodes' American Nightmare logo.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The beloved PS1 RPGs Suikoden I and II have returned in a remastered collection on consoles and PC. Nintendo Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X owners can still pick up the Day One Edition for $50 at multiple major retailers, including Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart. Meanwhile, PC players can take advantage of an awesome launch deal at Fanatical (a GameSpot sister site). Steam keys are discounted by 25% at Fanatical, which drops the price of the brand-new release to only $37.49 on launch day. Get deal at Fanatical Fanatical delivers Steam keys immediately after you finalize your transaction, so it's a quick process that ultimately saves you $12.50 compared to purchasing the game directly from Steam. As an added bonus, you'll also get a random free game or coupon for spending over $15 during Fanatical's massive Spring Sale. Suikoden I \u0026 II HD Remaster Day One Edition $50 Though console players will have to pay the full $50 price to play the collection this week, the physical edition for Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X comes bundled with a few useful in-game bonuses.The Day One Edition includes a code that unlocks immediate access to the Prosperity Orb and Fortune Orb in-game items, which double the amount of money and experience you earn from battles, respectively. You also get a bonus 57,300 Potch (in-game currency).The Orb items are acquirable in the game, but they're rare drops, so having them available immediately is a perk for players who don't want to spend as much time farming Potch and XP.You'll know the freebies are inside the box if you see the Day One Edition emblem on the cover art. Day One Editions sometimes sell out before launch, but Suikoden's appears to be in stock at all major retailers on release day.You can buy the $50 physical edition of Suikoden I \u0026 II HD Remaster for Nintendo Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X at Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Which would you rather collect: vintage clothes or vintage furniture? I could do both, but if I could only pick one, I’d have to go with vintage clothes, mostly because I don’t have a big enough house to collect furniture pieces. Sigh! Oh, and also, I don’t want to worry about my furniture being beat up by the pets and the kids playing in my house, you know? 2. How good are you with keeping secrets? If you tell me something in confidence, it’s going to the grave with me, babe; however, I do have an exception policy. If I believe someone’s in danger, then I’m gonna say something. 3. Who’s the coolest Jennifer: Jennifer Hudson, Jennifer Lopez, Jennifer Garner or Jennifer Coolidge?

    "description": "That little girl in the picture above turned nine years old today. Yup, today is Connor Claire’s ninth birthday! Wow. I remember that day up there like it was yesterday. Poor Tabs… He was slightly confused about the overall gist of the festivities. I think he thought it was a get-together to celebrate him. We didn’t want to burst his bubble, so we took a brief interlude to sing him the birthday song. “Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear tabby… Happy birthday to you!” 🙂 Connor Claire didn’t mind, and there was more than enough food, fun and love for everyone. It was kind of weird, but for the most part, Tabs wasn’t as social as he usually is. He spent most of the afternoon napping at the top of the stairs, away from the party. I checked in on him from time to time and gave him chin scratches and whispered that I love him.
