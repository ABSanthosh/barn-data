    "description": "Doom: The Dark Ages is here, bringing a brand-new campaign full of demons for you to rip and tear through. The third game in the modern Doom trilogy, Doom: The Dark Ages is a prequel, taking place in a more medieval time period, meaning your guns and weapons have a certain retro quality to them, like the new melee weapons and the new shield. Of course, there are still lots of guns and plenty of fast-paced shooting. Doom: The Dark Ages features a single-player campaign, and here's how long beating that will take you.Check out our Doom: The Dark Ages Collectibles Guides Hub for guides for every level.How long to beat Doom: The Dark Ages Doom: The Dark Ages will take you between 17-20 hours to beat. That estimate is for someone who is finding secret areas and collectibles during their run on normal difficulty, but not grabbing every single secret the first time through. GameSpot's critic Alessandro Barbosa took 18 hours to beat the game for GameSpot's Doom: The Dark Ages review, doing some of the side content during that run.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What made you smile today?
