    "description": "According to a reliable Lego leaker, the upcoming Lego Game Boy set will reportedly launch on October 1 for $60. The leak also says its a relatively small kit at just 421 pieces. The leak, which was first spotted by VGC, comes from noted Lego leaker Falconbrickstudios on Instagram. While leaks and rumors should never be considered facts, these details align with official information that Nintendo and Lego confirmed in the kit's initial announcement.Lego and Nintendo revealed the upcoming Lego Game Boy kit with a short teaser trailer on X (formerly Twitter). While the Lego Game Boy's design was not fully revealed, the teaser video previewed recognizable components like the classic purple face buttons, black D-pad, and pieces of the gray case. The teased pieces are small, so assuming the sizes of they are parts of the final design, then it's likely the leaked 421-brick figure is accurate.The short clip concludes with confirmation that the Lego Game Boy set will launch in October, but no specific date or pricing information was given--adding even more credence to the potential leak. We'll be sure to update this post when more information is announced, including preorder availability.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The option to romance NPC characters in RPGs has been around for a long time, and even recent titles like Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 offer that feature to players. However, Avowed is bucking that trend by almost completely removing players' ability to court their companions. According to Avowed director Carrie Patel, she made the decision to downplay romance because she felt it takes away from the experience of playing the game.While appearing on IGN's Unlocked podcast, Patel revealed that she believes the romantic options in RPGs \"undermine that core experience\" and practically invite players to focus more on the romance than on the story or even the characters themselves. Instead, Patel favored a more natural form of bonding with the player's companions that doesn't end with two characters in bed.\"My hope with players and their companion relationships in Avowed is that they would feel natural, and players would get out of them exactly what they want and exactly as much as they put in,\" said Patel. She added that it was supposed to be like \"you're getting to know some new friends.\"Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "One of my Xmas selection box games last year was Withering Rooms, a delightfully frightful haunted house action-RPG that balances mazey Metroidvania level design with the ability to be a witch who can supersize herself and gallop around on suits of magic armour. With a quick glance over my shoulder at our dear friend Sir Eugene Optimisation, I dare to describe it as a bit like Bloodborne, if Bloodborne had been made by a tiny independent developer. Also rather Bloodborney: the recently revealed Withering Realms, a sequel of sorts in which you play a ghost girl clinging to the back of a customisable combat doll. Sir Eugene Optimisation requests I add here that the doll conceit reminds him of well-received Soulslike Lies Of P. Which is a fair observation, I think, though I would also say the doll’s lipless, one-eyed grimace reminds me of Mouthwashing. How’s that, Eugene – three for three? Anyway, here’s a trailer.

Inspired by Monster Hunter's Hunting Horn, I've recently gotten into the habit of making characters who look like Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson.

I know that this year was kind of a challenging one for us. Between me not feeling like my usual self and struggling with some health things, we haven’t been spending a lot of time together, not like we used to. I want you to know, though, that I am still here, and that I still love you very much. I will always be so very proud of you and everything we’ve accomplished together. What’s in store for us this next year? I don’t know, but I have a feeling that it’s going to be a year full of love, growth and adventure.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Muumuu or tutu? Muumuu, babe. Mrs. Roper style all the way! 2. French braid or a messy bun? Messy bun. It’s like the default state of my hair these days, hahaha. 3. Something that reminds you of home? The smell of wet eucalyptus leaves (it’s a very Nor Cal scent, IMHO). Seeing green rolling hills in the distance. Bridges. 4. What’s the last book you finished that you’d like to recommend to a friend (aka me, hahaha)? I just finished reading “One Italian Summer” by Rebecca Searle, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It’s sweet and thoughtful, and I felt like I was on an Italian vacation in Positano while I was reading it. 5. Your feelings about nail art? Besides the fact that I’m terrible at it?[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 867 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
