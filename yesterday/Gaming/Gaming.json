    "description": "Bluey has collected tons of accolades over the years, including the TCA Award for Outstanding Achievement in Children’s Programming. The Australian animated show is extremely popular for viewers young and old, and later this year, Bluey and her family are getting their first official Lego sets. Specifics are yet to be revealed, but it has been confirmed that six Lego Bluey sets are arriving in 2025.The Lego Bluey lineup will span both the Lego 4+ and Duplo categories, making them smaller sets aimed at young builders. Duplo sets typically feature a few dozen large pieces to assemble, while Lego's Preschooler sets often have around 100 pieces each. You can expect the Bluey Lego and Duplo playsets to feature Bluey, Bingo, Bandit (Dad), and Chilli (Mom) as well as accessories that reference episodes of the show. Lego says the six sets will be revealed this spring and will give kids a chance to recreate scenes from the hit show. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Earlier this week, the ongoing saga of Destiny 2 reached a new turning point with the release of Revenant Act 3. But the conclusion of that chapter means that players are getting new weapons and other improvements going forward.Bungie has shared the details about Destiny 2's latest updates, including a pair of legendary weapons. The first is called Red Tape, and it's a stasis scout rifle; while the second is a stasis rocket launcher named Heretic's Fervor. You can see both weapons in action in the new trailer below, as well as a glimpse of the new exotic mission, Kell's Fall. Completing Kell's Fall will give players access to yet another weapon: A powerful exotic shotgun called Slayer’s Fang. Players can also replay Kell's Fall to upgrade Slayer's Fang with up to four catalysts. Starting with the next episode debut, Heresy, on February 4, Destiny 2 will also increase the caps for Strange Coins to 199, while Osirian Ciphers and Nightfall Ciphers will be bumped from 10 to 30. Bungie has also invited players to begin voting for next fall's Festival of the Lost Armor. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

I'm not sure I can put up with all that, which is a shame, because Beyond Citadel is otherwise a promising, eerie FPS that mixes ideas from 90s shooters in pretty appealing ways. Read more",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. If you could eat one food all day long, what would it be? Popcorn! If left to my own devices, I could easily have it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 2. Who in your life is most like you? To be honest, probably my dog, Marnie. 3. Your current favorite store? Ooh, girl. You know you’ve crossed a bridge when you no longer want to hang out at Sephora or Nordstrom anymore. LOL! These days I’m all about Williams Sonoma (the fancy kitchen store)! Who wants to come with me to gawk at gadgets, dutch ovens and tableware? 4. What’s one thing you need to do today?

    "description": "Tabs was world renowned for his ambitious new year’s resolutions, whether it was training for the Iron Cat Triathlon, studying for the MCCATs (Medical Cat College Admission Test) or committing to walk in all four of the year’s big feline fashion shows — the so-called Grand Slam of kitty supermeowdelry. But his goals weren’t always epic. Sometimes, they were something simple… My darlings, The new year is upon us, and, with that, many new year’s resolutions. I was talking to a few kitty friends of mine, and one resolution that always pops up is getting fit. Believe it or not, despite my statuesque frame, fitness is something I actually have to work hard to achieve. This body doesn’t come naturally. Well…most of it does, but I do have to put in the work, and I believe in putting in the work, especially in the pursuit of purr-fection. Because you’re my favorite fans, here are my top tips to get in tip-top shape in 2016. Walking works!
