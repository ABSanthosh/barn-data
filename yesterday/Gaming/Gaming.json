    "description": "Earlier this week, one of my industry peers James Bentley (they're over at that other site about PC games, GamerPCs I think it's called) put out a video essay titled \"I Can Guarantee You This Game is Going to be Underrated\". Trusting in James as a critic of varied and interesting taste, I clicked through and found that yeah, they're right, it probably will be. However, I also get to write about indie PC games for a living, so I'd like to do my part in telling you about this strange, point-and-click/ visual novel called Decade. Read more",

    "description": "I think there might be a chance, just ever so slightly, that the development of Cities Skylines 2 has been a bit difficult. The game launched back in October of 2023 and has suffered from performance issues, rushed DLC, and a delay to its first expansion Bridges and Ports. This expansion was meant to come soon after the Beach Properties DLC, but that obviously didn't happen, catching a delay to sometime in the second quarter of 2025 specifically to continue improving upon the base game. Except the expansion has been delayed once again. Read more",

The show's 14 episodes aired in 2002, but the story didn't completely end there. In 2005, much of the cast returned for Serenity, a sequel movie that answered some of the show's lingering questions. Firefly fans can celebrate Serenity's 20th anniversary with an upcoming limited-edition 4K release. Serenity: 20th Anniversary Limited Edition Steelbook is slated to launch July 22, and preorders are available now at Amazon and Walmart. Firefly: The Complete Series on Blu-ray $27.55 (was $30) See at Amazon See at Walmart Since Serenity is a direct sequel to Firefly, you may want to rewatch the TV show before revisiting the film. You can get Firefly: The Complete Series on Blu-ray for $27.55 at Amazon or $30 at Walmart. It's also available on DVD, but it actually costs more than the Blu-ray ($33). Serenity: 20th Anniversary Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray) $35 at Amazon / $30 at Walmart | Releases July 22 The 20th Anniversary Edition of Serenity includes 4K Blu-ray, standard Blu-ray, and digital copies of the film. It also comes with a gorgeous steelbook, featuring a striking blue and purple design on its exterior and a bunch of its characters (including Nathan Fillion’s Malcolm Reynolds) on the inside. There’s a slew of bonus features too, giving you a chance to check out behind-the-scenes content, outtakes, and deleted scenes.When you preorder at Amazon or Walmart, you won’t be charged until the item ships, and you’ll be eligible for any discounts between now and July 22. Amazon currently has the film listed at $35, while Walmart has it for $30.We'd expect the prices to match soon, but Amazon will be cheaper for Prime members since you'll get free shipping. At Walmart, you'd need to get your order total to at least $35 to avoid a $7 shipping fee (unless you're a Walmart+ subscriber).Serenity first released on 4K Blu-ray with standard packaging in 2017. You can pick up the standard 4K Blu-ray for $14.68 at Amazon. The 1080p Blu-ray edition is only $12. Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Walmart Serenity: 20th Anniversary Limited Edition SteelbookSerenity: 20th Anniversary Limited Edition Steelbook Bonus FeaturesMany of the bonus features offered on this Limited Edition Steelbook are the same as those found on the older formats. Still, there’s plenty to enjoy, and with commentary from Joss Whedon and the cast, various featurettes, and behind-the-scenes content, there’s a lot for you to explore.

But if you had your eye on the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 console bundles, you can snag one before Days of Play 2025 officially begins. As of 2 PM PT on May 27, Walmart is taking orders for the $450 PS5 Slim Call of Duty Bundle and the $400 PS5 Slim Digital Bundle. PS5 Slim Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Bundle $450 | Valued at $570 This bundle comes with the PS5 Slim with a Disc Drive and a voucher to redeem a digital copy of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 from the PlayStation Store. You'll also get one white DualSense Controller and three cables: USB-C charging cable, HDMI, and the power cord. If you want to display the PS5 vertically, as shown above, you'll need to buy the Vertical Stand for $30.Considering the PS5 Slim normally goes for $500 on its own, the $450 bundle is worth checking out even if you have no interest in Call of Duty.Earlier this year, PlayStation released a PS5 Slim bundle with Astro Bot for the same price. It's sold out at most retailers, but you can still get it for $450 at PS Direct. See at Walmart See at PS Direct See at Best Buy PS5 Slim Digital Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Bundle $400 | Valued at $520 The PS5 Slim Digital version of this bundle saves you an additional $50, but you'll miss out on the optical drive, meaning you will only be able to play games downloaded from the PlayStation Store.If you opt for the Slim Digital and decide later on you want to play physical games, you can purchase the Disc Drive separately for $80. Once again, the Vertical Stand is sold separately. See at Walmart See at PS Direct See at Best Buy Beyond these enticing Black Ops bundles, the Days of Play event offers tons of other great deals. PS5 Pro consoles are $50 off, dropping the price of PlayStation's high-end console to $650. This is the first discount on the PS5 Pro since its launch last holiday. You can pair your new console with discounted controllers, as DualSense Edge Controllers are $30 off, and standard DualSense Controllers are $20 off.

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. When was the last time you spent a good amount of time outside? Yesterday morning. Connor had a sleepover with a friend the night before, and the girls wanted to play outside, so we all hung out in the circle. The girls played and did art projects; I walked Marnie and threw her ball for her about a billion times, LOL! 2. Do you sleep on your back, your tummy or your side? Usually my back. If my sinuses are stuffed up (hello allergy season), then it’s my side. 3. What’s something beautiful about today? Well, I get to spend it with the people I love the most – Connor, El Hub, Marnie and Rosie. 4. What’s one pair of shoes you wear a lot?

    "description": "Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC always celebrates Memorial Day, a federal holiday in the United States for honoring and mourning the U.S. military personnel who died while serving in the United States Armed Forces. Despite his differences of opinion over some of the country’s policies and his disdain for some of its leaders over the years, Tabs strongly believed in the greatness of the United States. He actually had the U.S. Constitution memorized and would frequently cite portions of it. One of his favorite quotes is from the preamble: “We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.” But he felt it was the First Amendment that defined America. Without it, America would cease to exist. As Tabs always said, the promise of American democracy depends on our freedom to criticize it.[Continue reading...] The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 862 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
