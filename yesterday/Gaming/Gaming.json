    "description": "SanDisk high-capacity microSD cards are on sale for great prices at Amazon. If you're looking to expand your storage space on Steam Deck, Nintendo Switch, or a handheld Windows PC, you have multiple reliable options in the 1TB and higher range. Most notably, you can get the SanDisk Ultra 1.5TB microSD card for $95, which is the lowest price we've seen since Amazon's Black Friday sale when it was $89.Quick Look: Best MicroSD Card Deals at Amazon (February 2025)SanDisk Ultra 1.5TB microSD (150MB/s) -- $89 ($150)SanDisk Extreme 2TB microSD (190MB/s) -- $180 ($210)SanDisk 1TB microSD - Pokemon, Snorlax Edition (100MB/s) -- $100 ($150)Samsung Pro Plus 1TB microSD - Sonic the Hedgehog Edition (180MB/s) -- $100 ($126)Samsung Pro Plus 1TB microSD (180MB/s) -- $100 ($120)TeamGroup A2 Pro Plus 1TB microSD (160MB/s) -- $65 ($75)Lexar Play 1TB microSD (160MB/s) -- $70 ($130)Lexar Play 1TB microSD (205MB/s) -- $98 ($125) SanDisk Ultra 1.5TB microSD Card $95 (was $150) The SanDisk Ultra works without a hitch on Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch, and it's also one of the most reliable and popular microSD cards around. It's graded for speeds of up to 150MB/s, which is faster than the officially licensed Nintendo microSDs by SanDisk and plenty fast enough for PC games installed to it on your Steam Deck.Walmart also has the $95 deal, but your order will be shipped by Newegg if you get the card from Walmart.The 1.5TB SanDisk Ultra microSD often sells for much higher prices at other major retailers. For instance, the card is $155 (was $160) at Best Buy at the moment. See at Amazon See at Walmart SanDisk Extreme 2TB microSD Card $180 (was $210) Up until late last year, the 1.5TB card was the largest SanDisk offered, but now the storage device giant manufactures a 2TB model of the high-end SanDisk Extreme microSD card. It carries an eye-watering $210 MSRP, but you can pick it up for $180 at Amazon right now. The $30 discount matches the card's Black Friday 2024 price.The SanDisk Extreme offers up to 190MB/s transfer speeds. For Nintendo Switch users, it doesn't really make sense to buy the SanDisk Extreme, but handheld gaming PC users may appreciate the faster file transfer speeds.If you want the faster speeds but don't need a 2TB card, the 1TB SanDisk Extreme is on sale for $80. You can grab 512GB and 256GB SanDisk Extreme cards for $38 and $19, respectively. See at Amazon See at Amazon (1TB) Pokemon-themed SanDisk 1TB microSD Card $100 (was $150) SanDisk has a range of officially licensed microSD cards imprinted with characters and emblems from popular Nintendo franchises. One of the newest additions to that lineup is this 1TB Pokemon-themed model, which appropriately features Snorlax.All of the Nintendo-themed cards carry higher prices than the regular SanDisk cards. You're saving $50 off this card's launch price, but it still costs more than the 1.5TB SanDisk Ultra right now. This card has a read speed of up to 100MB/s, so it's not as fast as the Ultra either. On Nintendo Switch this won't make a difference, but if for some reason you want a Pokemon-themed microSD for your Steam Deck, the drop in speed is worth keeping in mind.Zelda fans can get a 1TB SanDisk microSD emblazoned with the Hylian Crest for $115 (was $150) at Amazon. See at Amazon Amazon has notable deals on a bunch of other PC and gaming storage devices, including the WD Black C50 Xbox Expansion Card, which is also on sale for its best price since Black Friday.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Last spring, I flew to Thailand to visit the set of Alien: Earth, the upcoming FX and Hulu TV series based on Ridley Scott's beloved series. As a horror fan, it was incredible to place myself in the middle of some iconic imagery from the series. A VR game like Alien: Rogue Incursion offers a similar promise: Immerse yourself in the world of Alien in a way no game has previously allowed--natively anyway, as Alien: Isolation does enjoy some player-made VR mods today. But Rogue Incursion can't quite capture the essence of the series for a multitude of reasons, but chief among them is a starring monster who feels suddenly toothless.Alien: Rogue Incursion is a VR-only entry in the long history of video games based on Alien. Typically, those titled Alien--singular--look to the slow-paced original for inspiration, while those prefixed with the plural, Aliens, go for a more action-oriented take akin to James Cameron's sequel. That's the first oddity of Rogue Incursion. It's not necessarily beholden to this naming convention, but the game has you spraying-and-praying at so many Xenos that it feels more like an action game than the survival-horror experience you might expect.This is despite the fact that the developers clearly looked toward Alien: Isolation for inspiration, from the look of the androids--which Creative Assembly had introduced to the mythology back in 2014--to the signature movement scanner that you can now physically pull from your inventory in VR. Isolation protagonist Amanda Ripley is even name-dropped at one moment, so it seems Rogue Incursion wants to harken back to its predecessor... until it doesn't.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Finally! A sunny week. 🌞 This is such a great time of year in the Bay Area. It’s still a bit wintry, but we usually get a few weeks in late February that are ridiculously perfect. Sunny and crisp with highs in the upper 60s to low 70s. We’ve gotten more rain than usual (the new usual) for three years in a row, including this one, which is weird because we had a drought that lasted a decade! I know it’s temporary, but for three years the weather has been, like, retro normal. Trees are healthy again, the streams and rivers are flowing — it’s bizarre! This is the time of year one of my tabby’s favorite flowers bloomed. Tulips! He loved almost everything about them. (“Almost” because he did not like the fact that they’re toxic.) Rosie loves this time of year too. Not quite spring, but not quite the dead of winter either.

    "description": "My sweet MBB, Goodness gracious, you are 18 today. I can’t believe it, but yet I can. We’ve been together so long, haven’t we? I know that this year was kind of a challenging one for us. Between me not feeling like my usual self and struggling with some health things, we haven’t been spending a lot of time together, not like we used to. I want you to know, though, that I am still here, and that I still love you very much. I will always be so very proud of you and everything we’ve accomplished together. What’s in store for us this next year? I don’t know, but I have a feeling that it’s going to be a year full of love, growth and adventure.
