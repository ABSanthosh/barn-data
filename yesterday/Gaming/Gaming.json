    "description": "Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2, aka Lawless season, starts on Friday, and it's bringing us an early dose of something we thought we'd have to wait until at least the fall for: a new Grand Theft Auto. Not literally, of course. Epic is not collaborating with Rockstar Games here--they're just adding a new urban location on the map called Crime City, and we'll be spending much of our time this season stealing stuff from vaults, armored cars, and the train, and each other. Yep, sounds like GTA to me.It's amusing timing, given that the very long awaited Grand Theft Auto 6 looks like it might actually come out this year, a decade and two console generations since GTA 5 launched back in 2013. But even with a proper new GTA title finally peeking its head above the horizon, Epic beat them to the punch with Lawless season.Not convinced by the comparison? Let's take a look at the season trailer.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/overwatch-2-battle-pass-season-15-all-skins-emotes-and-rewards/2900-6272/",
    "description": "Overwatch 2 Season 15 marks a new beginning for the hero shooter, adding a new perk system and bringing back loot boxes. It also marks a ranked reset with the new gameplay features. Naturally, Season 15 also adds a new battle pass to the game, although this one is lacking a cohesive theme thanks to this season being more focused on gameplay changes than new cosmetic content. The new season also marks a new year of ranked play, which means you can now earn competitive points to unlock the Galactic weapon skins for heroes, which can only be obtained by playing competitive matches.One of the biggest changes to the battle pass as part of Season 15 is the inclusion of loot boxes in the battle pass. Loot boxes cannot be purchased directly, but there are a few in the battle pass and as rewards for challenges. In the battle pass, there are three legendary loot boxes, two of which are part of the premium pass. These offer a guaranteed legendary item each, while normal loot boxes only offer a slim chance of getting such an item. The battle pass also has plenty of other cosmetics, like emotes, highlight intros, victory poses, and name cards to unlock in both the free and premium versions.The premium battle pass includes a few legendary skins, like Rainy Day Kiriko, Goumang Hanzo, Cyber Enforcer Zarya, and Toxic Venture, along with a few Epic skins as well. There are also Mythic shards, which can be used to get the new Pixiu Mythic Zenyatta skin, or previously released Mythic skins and guns, like the Lead Rose Mythic Ashe gun skin. The premium version of the battle pass costs 1,000 Overwatch coins (about $10), but there is also a bundle for $40, which includes two exclusive legendary skins, the premium battle pass, 20 tier skips, and 2,000 Overwatch coins (about $20).",

They're fancier-looking with tweaked or expanded movesets, but it's a familiar line-up beneath the extra layers of flesh and metal. I recognise most from my ancient PSP copy of Monster Hunter Freedom 2, released in 2007. Capcom have thrown in a few novelties such as Monster Hunter 4's Insect Glaive over the intervening years, but according to Wilds director Yuya Tokuda, the developers currently feel it's more important to trick out and rebalance the existing wargear than give you entire new ways to play.
