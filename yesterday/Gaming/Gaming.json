    "title": "How To Complete Atomfall Mother Jago Quest",
    "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/how-to-complete-atomfall-mother-jago-quest/2900-6406/",
    "description": "Mother Jago is a quest you can add to your investigations fairly early on in Atomfall. At first, it seems like your run-of-the-mill side quest that requires you to visit an NPC on the map, do a job for them, and get some kind of reward. However, Mother Jago isn't just any old NPC in the Quarantine Zone. She's one of the more important characters in the entire story, and she even has a way out of the Quarantine Zone if you follow her instructions. The question is, how do you complete the entire Mother Jago quest in Atomfall, and is her ending worth it? Find out everything you need to know in the walkthrough below. Finding Mother JagoThere are a few ways you can come across Mother Jago in Atomfall. Just like any other character in the Quarantine Zone, she's at a designated location, allowing you to easily stumble upon her location just by exploring the map.Mother Jago is located in the top northeastern part of Casterfell Woods, and she remains there for the duration of the game up until the very end. Specifically, you can find Mother Jago at the \"Old Mine\" location that's east of the Dam Data Store and northeast of the Sewer Tunnels entrance, which is the easiest route to get to and from Casterfell Woods. The coordinates for the Old Mine are 27.2 E, 92.2 N.If you didn't stumble across Mother Jago's position, you likely found a leaflet that told you to visit the Old Mine and find the character. Whether you find the leaflet or not doesn't change much, but having the leaflet does allow you to access a new dialogue option when speaking to Mother Jago. Either way, once you find the character, speak to her to begin the Mother Jago investigation in Atomfall. Going to the Druid's CampAfter speaking with Mother Jago, she'll tell you a little bit about herself and ask a favor of you. The favor is to go and fetch a book on herbalism that the local Druid faction stole from her possession. Mother Jago says the book is located inside the Druids' castle at the center of their area of operations.Specifically, you need to travel to the \"Druid's Camp\" location found at the very southwestern part of the Casterfell Woods map. Here, the Druids have erected a large, wooden statue of some deity up on a cliff. There also happen to be dozens of Druids in and around the entire area, so you have to choose whether to be stealthy or go in with a full frontal assault in mind. The easiest method I found was to use a bow and silently pick off Druids.Regardless of your tactics, you need to reach the \"Castle Ruins\" entrance inside the Druid's Camp. This is located on the eastern side of the camp, and it requires you to ascend a couple of stories via the walkways along the cliff. The coordinates for the Castle Ruins are 20.6 E, 83.7 N.Inside the Castle Ruins, you'll find a number of Druids all worshipping someone called the \"High Priestess.\" They're all mostly standing around a large, blue glowing hole in the ground that the High Priestess is making sacrifices to from a high-up perch. You can find an Atomic Battery lying at the base of this blue hole in the ground. Retrieving Mother Jago's BookInside the Castle Ruins, you'll find a number of Druids all worshipping someone called the \"High Priestess.\" They're all mostly standing around a large, blue glowing hole in the ground that the High Priestess is making sacrifices to from a high-up perch. You can find an Atomic Battery lying at the base of this blue hole in the ground. From just looking at the initial area of the Castle Ruins, it doesn't look too large. You can kill the Druids around the blue hole along with the High Priestess, but Mother Jago's Book is nowhere to be found. Instead of staying around the blue hole in the ground, you need to locate a bridge that's off to the side of the opening area. Go across the bridge and keep ascending the various ladders, staircases, and hills that are found along the path set out for you. Eventually, after climbing a hill with grassy weeds and crumbling castle walls, you'll come to a larger area with a hole in the ceiling that's causing light to shine in. From this area, head up a staircase into a library, where you can find Mother Jago's Book sitting on a back table surrounded by candles. With the book in hand, head out the way you came in and return to Mother Jago with it. Explore the Speaking CaveAfter delivering Mother Jago's Book to her at the Old Mine, she'll say that she actually has a good relationship with the Druids and her book wasn't actually stolen. Retrieving the book was a test of trust, which you passed. Mother Jago now says she has a way out of the Quarantine Zone, but before you can escape, you need to visit the Speaking Cave and leave an offering there.The Speaking Cave is located in the southern part of Casterfell Woods at coordinates 23.0 E, 85.4 N. Here, you can enter the cave freely, as Mother Jago has given you an item that makes you a friend to the Druids. Inside the Speaking Cave, follow your quest marker to head up to the end of the winding paths. The paths culminate in front of a large, wooden structure with a bowl placed on a table under it. Approach the bowl, interact with it, and place an offering inside of it.Once this is done, you'll hear a voice come out of a detached head from the wooden structure that looks to be the \"Voice in the Soil\" that's been causing so much panic in the Quarantine Zone. You'll also have to make a dialogue choice that pledges your loyalty to the Voice in the Soil and the Druids going forward. If you choose the \"Confrontational\" option, you have to fight your way out of the cave, and the Mother Jago quest can't be fully completed.If you head past the wooden structure, you'll find a small room with some valuable items, including a recording from Captain Sims. If you haven't already, this begins the Captain Sims quest in Atomfall.After the offering is placed and you've explored the Speaking Cave, return to Mother Jago once more at the Old Mine. Find the Growth StimulantWhen you return to Mother Jago, tell her you made the offering. If you didn't choose the confrontational dialogue option, you can proceed with the quest. Mother Jago now tells you of a Growth Stimulant that she wants you to \"feed\" to Oberon. Oberon is the large meteor in the Interchange that caused the Quarantine Zone to be put up. Mother Jago and the Druids want Oberon to grow and continue to effect change throughout the surrounding lands. To find the Growth Stimulant, you have to head into the Interchange and visit the Medical facility. The entrance to the Medical facility is located to the west of Data Store C. The entrance is on the ground floor of the Interchange. When you enter the Medical facility, you then have to find the entrance to the Medical Tunnels, which is found further west. You'll have to head past several thrall enemies as well as a large plant enemy in the middle of a large cavern.Go past the plant on its left side to head up a new path and find the Growth Stimulant sitting on the ground next to a dead scientist. With the Growth Stimulant, head out the way you came in, making sure to avoid the plant as best as possible, and stay in the Interchange. Feed the Growth Stimulant to OberonWhen you have the Growth Stimulant, you have everything you need to enter the Oberon facility in the Interchange. To do that, you need to power up every single Data Store Room in the Interchange and then turn on the Central Processing Unit located in the central room. Once the CPU is powered on, a new entrance to the Windscale Plant will become available.Take the Windscale Plant entrance to access the new area with Oberon. You have to go through the Windscale Plant before reaching Oberon, which is full of thrall enemies. But after you get through the plant, you'll be in the Oberon Digsite area. Here, you need to take the Growth Stimulant and head to the large building located to the immediate left of the digsite entrance. This is found before you reach the purple-glowing Oberon rock.Inside this building, you have to navigate through a series of hallways, sometimes defeating enemies in haz-mat suits, until you reach the command center of the digsite. On one of the command center consoles, you'll find the \"Fire Safety Fluid Input Terminal.\" You need to insert the Growth Stimulant into this terminal.Once that happens, head down to Oberon itself, being careful to avoid the patrolling robots on the ground level, and find two \"Fire Safety Valves.\" These are located on either end of the digsite and require a simple interaction to use. Now, you can head back up to the command center in the building and turn on the \"Fire Safety Valves.\"After these are activated, head back down to the digsite once more. Exit the Oberon Digsite area, make your way back through the Windscale Plant, and go to the Castle Ruins at the Druid's Camp in Casterfell Woods. There, jump into the blue glowing hole in the ground at the command of the Voice in the Soil. This ends Atomfall.",

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What could you use most right now: cuddles with pets, a hot cup of tea or a nap? I’m drinking a hot cup of tea at the moment, and I’m not too sleepy, so I’ll take the cuddles from the pets. 2. On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the highest, how concerned are you about AI? Girl. As someone who named her daughter after a great science fiction heroine who rises up to help defeat the robots, I’m going to give this a solid 10. I’m freaked out, man! 3. Something unexpected that happened to you recently? Well, I saw a bobcat out of my window when I was at work last week! (See the pic at the top.) The campus has a lot of[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 872 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Rosie, being scientifically oriented, has an affinity for baking. She appreciates the precision and thinks of it like working in a lab, except one where you’re able to sample the fruits of your labor. We’re all so excited because she opened her new French bakery, La boulangerie de Rosie, in Novato this weekend. I know! Very exciting. Unfortunately for Rosie, Marnie was her baking assistant, but it doesn’t look like that’s going to work out because Marnie has no regard for recipes or measurements…or really, any kind of precision. Actually, Rosie didn’t come up with the idea for the bakery herself. Tabs, as you know, was very forwarding thinking, and toward the last years of his reign he planned to open a high-end cat bakery that also catered to humans (but also cats), and Rosie borrowed the idea. We can safely assume that if Tabs had gotten the business off the ground, it would have been a huge success. Yup, everything that cat touched turned to gold. 💛 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 856 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "I know we're all about PC games, but none of you will mind if I reminisce about how good PS2 games were, would you? Good, because they were! And Havenhold, the debut game from the Beijing based Wolfpack Games, looks like it could quite easily be one, even if it has some modern sensibilities in places. You play as a Taichu warrior monk, fighting against other players as you all vye for the top of a special mountain, with the catch being that the game's world completely resets every 14 days.

    "description": "Much like many of you, I suspect, I too would love a Dishonored 3, but I'm not entirely confident it will ever happen. Arkane Austin was obviously shut down last year, and Arkane Lyon are making a Blade game, which leaves little room for a Dishonored sequel. But is there any possibility of one happening all the same? Well, still no, probably, but Arkane Studios founder and Dishonored co-creator Raphaël Colantonio did recently say that he could at the very least see himself working on a follow-up. Read more",
