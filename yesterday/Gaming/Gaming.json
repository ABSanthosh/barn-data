    "description": "Shatterscarp is the third region you can visit during your journey in Avowed. It's home to Thirdborn, a town full of misfits, pirates, and outlaws. Shatterscarp is arguably the most dangerous region in the Living Lands, as the Dreamscourge has completely taken over the inhabitants and there's a dangerous Archmage at work that's devouring whole sections of the map.Through all of this chaos, though, there are some gorgeous locations and plenty of content to consume in addition to the main story quests. To make your time easier in Shatterscarp, we went through the trouble of fully uncovering the entire map, allowing you to see where everything is and how to get there. The guide below will showcase the uncovered map as well as some key points of interest that you'll want to visit in Avowed.Full Shatterscarp Map in AvowedUnlike other regions in Avowed, Shatterscarp is centered around its hub city of Thirdborn. Instead, Thirdborn is a small settlement that borders the ocean on the southern border of the map. At the center of Shatterscarp is a massive mountain that you can't really traverse, forcing you to go around it if you want to visit the sprawling locations in the region.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "After hours and hours of exploring three separate maps in Avowed, you finally arrive at Galawain's Tusks in search of the mythical Garden. Galawain's Tusks is certainly the least aesthetically pleasing map in the game, as the lava from Mt. Forja and Solace Keep along with the acid sea have turned the entire region a red, greyish color. Still, Galawain's Tusks is by far the largest map in Avowed and there's a ton to see and do as soon as you arrive.Opening up your map for the first time in Galawain's Tusks can be a little overwhelming, as the size of the region is unlike anything you've seen up to this point. Fortunately for you, we spent hours combing through the entire map to fully uncover all of the fog on it. You can see the uncovered Galawain's Tusks map along with some points of interest in the guide below so you have a much better idea of where you're going.Full Galawain's Tusks Map in AvowedThere are technically three different parts to Galawain's Tusks and there's very little that gets in your way of exploring the whole map. While there are certainly mountains, bridges, and towers surrounding every part of the map, you can fully explore all of it.
