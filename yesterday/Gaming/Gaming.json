    "description": "Once your adventure in Dragon Age: The Veilguard draws to a close, you'll find yourself staring at the main menu. But, wait, did you see anything after the credits rolled? Well, there's certainly something that you can unlock during your playthrough, but it's going to take a bit of effort. Here's our guide on how to get the secret post-credits scene in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Likewise, please be reminded that this article contains spoilers.How to get the secret post-credits scene in Dragon Age: The VeilguardThe Dragon Age: The Veilguard post-credits scene only triggers if you're able to acquire all three Mysterious Circles during your playthrough. These strange objects are found in specific areas of the world, and picking them up causes Rook to hear voices.There's actually no quest that notifies you about tracking them down specifically. That's why it's possible to just stumble upon these while exploring. Mysterious Circle #1: Arlathan ForestThe first Dragon Age: The Veilguard Mysterious Circle that you're likely to find is in Arlathan Forest. Specifically, it's in an area called Forest Mire. There's an ornate chest on an island in the middle of a stream, but you won't be able to reach it until you progress a bit further into the campaign.Eventually, the rest of the area opens up, allowing you to explore your surroundings. There, you'll see three beam turrets. Bring the nearby power crystals so you can activate each turret. Then, use them to fire the beam at the floating receptacles on the walls. Once all three receptacles have been activated, you'll be able to cross the river.Take out the Guardian of Secrets enemy and open the chest to obtain a unique helmet called the Iron Veil. If you look behind the chest, you'll spot a floating disk with flames. Now that's a curious sight indeed. Mysterious Circle #2: Necropolis HallsIf you really want the Dragon Age: The Veilguard post-credits scene, then you have to grab the second Mysterious Circle from the Necropolis Halls. Well, technically, it's from several areas. Here's a quick summary:After recruiting Emmrich, return to the Necropolis Halls and complete a quest called Restless Spirits. The objective is to bring the wisps to the receptacles to unlock a doorway.In the next chamber, take out the enemies and walk to the large door with three seals. This starts the Pinnacle of Its Kind quest.The goal in Pinnacle of Its Kind is to defeat three demons, variants of the Formless One, in specific regions. Track the quest so you can quickly find your targets in: Dock TownArlathan ForestHossberg WetlandsAfter defeating the three mini-demons, which are already tough encounters if you're unprepared, return to the Necropolis Halls chamber and be ready for an even harder fight. You'll be up against the true version of the Formless One, a level 40 High Dragon. This beast uses the electric element to call down lightning and blast you with shocking beams. Needless to say, you've got your work cut out for you.If you do manage to defeat your target, don't leave the arena just yet. Instead, look for a small nook at the back to find another Mysterious Circle. Mysterious Circle #3: CrossroadsThis Mysterious Circle in Dragon Age: The Veilguard comes from Beacon Island, the initial area of the Crossroads and, no, it's not going to be a straightforward task. Basically, you have to complete a quest called Heart of Corruption.You can learn more about the steps in our Heart of Corruption guide, but here's a quick summary:You need to defeat champions in specific regions so you can unlock sealed areas in the Crossroads.These areas are guarded by revenants, which are higher level elites. Defeating them nets you their essence.The three essences are needed to remove the wards of the thrice-sealed door.Finally, you have to beat the Revenant Dragon boss, which uses different elemental abilities.Once the Revenant Dragon has been taken care of, check the small nook next to the wolf statue. You should find the third and final floating orb that you need. Explaining the post-credits scene in Dragon Age: The VeilguardNow that you have all three Mysterious Circles, you should be guaranteed to unlock the Dragon Age: The Veilguard post-credits scene. Of course, you still need to complete the finale section. This can take you a couple of hours or so, maybe more if you want to be a completionist to ensure that \"most\" characters survive.In any case, after the credits stop rolling, a cutscene will trigger showing different images--some reference events from Veilguard, while others talk about what had transpired from previous games. The scene ends when a black inverted pyramid with jagged lines forms, and the voice says, \"We come...\"So, what does all this mean? Well, the pyramids are definitely not related to Savathun or the Witness from Destiny 2. Rather, the images might be a warning about the Executors, a shadowy group that operates \"across the sea.\" The organization has had a keen interest regarding events that happen in Thedas, so they might be planning something big. Also, we know very little of the world outside the continent of Thedas, so perhaps this looming threat awaits us in the next game.That does it for our guide on how to get the post-credits scene in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Since this takes place once you're finished with the campaign, perhaps you'd like to keep most of your characters and allies alive, too. We've got a finale and endings guide to help you out.The lands of Thedas are under threat from formidable foes, including some menacing elven gods, and it's up to Rook and their allies to save the day.

    "description": "Adventuring in Dragon Age: The Veilguard naturally leads to many discoveries. More often than not, you'll even find chests just waiting to be looted. There's one, however, that's found in Rivain Coast, and it has a somewhat tricky riddle. Here's our guide on how to solve the Treasure of Sharksmouth Puzzle in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.How to solve the Treasure of Sharksmouth Mountain puzzle in Dragon Age: The VeilguardThe Dragon Age: The Veilguard Treasure of Sharksmouth Mountain objective takes place in an area of the Rivain Coast known as the Lair of the Dragon King. You'll gain access to this place by progressing Taash's personal quests.Once you're finally there, you might notice a message inscribed on a tower. However, you won't be able to solve it while you're in the middle of doing Taash's quest. Instead, you have to defeat the boss and return to the area so you can freely explore it. The Treasure of Sharksmouth Mountain riddleTo solve the Treasure of Sharksmouth Mountain puzzle in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, you have to take note of the clues in the riddle. The message can be read via the inscription on the tower's door or the shield inside the fortress.Four knights rode to battle.One fired unto the rightward flank, her arrows a steel rain.One lingered, their shield behind to guard all's back.One went boldly to the fore, her sword thrust forward unto the foe.One crept upon the leftward flank, his hammer a harvest reaped.While we can certain provide the solution immediately, let's first take a look at the mechanics of the puzzle itself. Basically, the passage refers to the knights and the cardinal directions that their statues should be facing. But we don't know the names of these knights yet, so we have to find more clues. Arrow: Ser Rian the RedWhen you track the quest, four markers will appear denoting the locations of four statues with clues. One of these is at the far corner of the fortress. A large blight boil is blocking the small nook, so destroy the pods and tendrils so you can check the clue. You'll learn that the knight that let arrows loose is Ser Rian the Red. Shield: Ser Ifean Beloved of the MoonIn the main area of the fortress, you should see a rift that you can interact with. Use the perk from Lucanis/Spite to create a spectral platform so you can cross the chasm. You'll then learn that Ser Ifean is the knight that used his shield to defend others. Sword: Ser Dheon the SilentOutside the fortress, you'll spot a ruined hut. On the roof of this hut and around it are multiple blight growths. Once destroyed, check the small room that became accessible to find another statue with a clue. It seems that Ser Dheon was the knight who thrust her sword forward when facing foes. Hammer: Ser Cruach the WolfFinally, head to the stone pathway that leads to the lava flows. Use Harding's perk to raise the stone slabs and interact with the note on the statue. The note tells you that the knight with the hammer was Ser Cruach. Treasure of Sharksmouth Mountain solutionNow, it's time to solve the Treasure of Sharksmouth Mountain in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. In the inner section of the fortress, you'll see four knight statues. Next to them are shield decorations that mention their names. Basically, this means that each knight statue must face the correct cardinal direction: North, east, south, and west.You can see the solution in the image above, but take note that we angled the camera above our character. Also, we advise you to disable the \"rotate minimap\" option so it doesn't get confusing. Here's a quick summary in any case:Rian statue faces east.Ifean statue faces south.Dheon statue faces north.Cruach statue faces west. Treasure of Sharksmouth Mountain rewardsIf you do it right, the tower door should open. Inside, you'll find three chests. You can grab duplicates of the Brawler's Decorated Leathers and Weisshaupt's Wall to increase their rarity. There's also a larger ornate chest that contains the Meredith's Legacy unique longsword. It has the following perks:Stats: +325 necrotic damage; +400 stagger.Perks: +10% leech effectiveness; this weapon leeches HP on hit; you no longer gain health from potions or companion abilities.That does it for our guide on how to complete Treasure of Sharksmouth Mountain in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The Meredith's Legacy is just one of many nifty rewards to acquire in the game. You can learn about the others in our unique items guide.The lands of Thedas are under threat from formidable foes, including some menacing elven gods, and it's up to Rook and their allies to save the day.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Last Halloween costume you wore? Hmm, a couple years ago I was a panda! It was a low-effort panda though. LOL! 2. Best and worst Halloween candy? I used to love Snickers, but now I find them too sweet, so please give me all the Ghrirardelli Caramel Squares. As for the worst ones, I automatically toss the rolls of Smarties and anything licorice related. Blech! 3. Pick your Halloween nail color – orange or black? Black with a high shine top coat please. 4. Vampires or werewolves? I’d rather hang out with the werewolves. 5. Scariest Halloween movie? “The Shining” still freaks me out! Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S. Here are the questions to copy/paste with your answers in a comment. Talk to ya soon.[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 854 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "No one threw a Halloween shindig like Tabs — fancy cat costumes, spooky snacks, special appearances from top-tier talent, including Tabs. In fact, Heidi Klum stole the idea for her spooky soirees from him. Here’s a look back at a typical Halloween 🎃 and all the prep Tabs usually did. My Darlings, There’s an old saying in the plus-size kitty modeling world: “Go big or go home,” and I take that phrase to heart when it comes to hosting parties. I want my guests to be talking about them for years to come. Being a famous feline supermodel, I’ve hosted many Halloween shindigs in my time, and I have almost a decade of party-planning experience. In that vein, here are the four essential components of a successful feline Halloween party. 1. Invitations First things first — the invitations. In the digital age, e-vites and group invites via Facebook are acceptable; however, I’m a little old fashioned. I prefer paper invitations.
