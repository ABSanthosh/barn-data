    "description": "Do you want to hunt down all targets for The Butterfly Collector in Assassin's Creed Shadows? These women have been kidnapping children in the city of Osaka. But, before you can locate them, you must first gather a few items. Only then will their locations be revealed.Where to find all targets for The Butterfly Collector in Assassin's Creed Shadows - The Butterfly Collector quest guideThe Butterfly Collector might be a side quest, but it's certainly a big one that's more involved than most other optional tasks in the game. Here's a quick summary:You can start the quest by talking to an NPC known as the Gamemaker. She's in Katano in the Izumi Settsu region. She's right next to the ornament vendor, who's between Katano Castle and Katano Oil Trading.The Gamemaker wants you to find several origami items for her. We discuss these further in our Origami Butterflies guide.There are 10 Origami Butterflies, and some of these are actually letters addressed to the other kidnappers. While you do receive clues, we recommend acquiring all 10 items first before searching for your targets. Map of The Butterfly Collector targetsThe map above shows the locations of the Assassin's Creed Shadows Butterfly Collector targets. As you can see, there are four targets with their own mini-quest chains that lead to other areas of Osaka:Mucho: Starts with Find the ChildShucho: Starts with The One That Got AwayRicho: Starts with All Will Be WellKacho: Leads to Paper Trail and Chrysalis - You need to eliminate the first three targets before the objectives to find Kacho appear. Mucho's location: Find the ChildMucho is the easiest one to deal with among all the Assassin's Creed Shadows Butterfly Collector targets. Simply head to Kojo Ruins, which is west of the Temple of Osaka. You should see a woman (Mucho) next to a little boy. As you approach, Mucho will run away. You can either assassinate her if she hasn't been alerted yet, or you can strike her down in combat. Do watch out for other guards that are nearby.Once Mucho has been taken care of, talk to the child. Hold the button to auto-follow so you can accompany the boy to his father. Shucho's location: The One That Got AwayTo find Shucho, you need to go to the Fisherman's District near a yard where you found the Pink Origami Butterfly from earlier. There, you'll spot a child who's crying. Talk to her to learn that the kidnapper is nearby. Follow the narrow street to the east and keep the aim button held down. The glowing blue marker should reveal Shucho. Richo's location: All Will Be WellThis particular target, Richo, requires a bit of a trek:All Will Be Well - Head north of the gear vendor/kakurega until you arrive at a yard with a ruined well. Wait a while until you hear two workers talking about a bamboo grove.Forest Fugitive - Make your way to the bamboo grove north of Noda Village. As you approach the cabin, Naoe will remark about how that might be the perfect spot where someone would hide a kidnapped child.Eliminate Richo as you see fit. Then, accompany the girl until she reaches her mom near the outskirts of the city. Kacho's location: Paper Trail and ChrysalisNow that you've taken out the three initial Butterfly Collector targets in Assassin's Creed Shadows, it's time to finish off their boss, Kacho. There are a few tasks that you need to tackle first:Paper Trail - Go to the Temple of Osaka and look for a big tree along the narrow street to the north. Hold down the aim button to see the blue outline denoting the paper merchant's location.Chrysalis - Head to the Fishermen's District just a stone's throw away. A small hut in the yard has a note that you can read.Once both mini-quests are done, you'll learn that Kacho is in Nishinomaru Garden, which is just west of Osaka Castle. This is a restricted area, so try to avoid the guards as much as possible. Upon reaching Kacho, a cutscene will trigger, and you'll have to fight her normally. Should you spare or kill the Gamemaker?With Kacho's dying breath, she mentions that there's one more member of the group. It's none other than the person who gave you this quest all the way back in Katano. Now, it's time to decide if you should spare or kill the Gamemaker in Assassin's Creed Shadows. You can also give her a fitting name, though it won't have any bearing on how the quest is concluded.That's everything you need to know about how to complete The Butterfly Collector in Assassin's Creed Shadows. Here are all the rewards that you can obtain as part of this entire arc:Mucho - Hidden Pleat (uncommon tanto).Richo - The Dog-Ear (uncommon tanto).Richo's kidnapping victim - Trinket of Childlike Bravery (accessory).Shucho - Ink Spiller (rare tanto)Kacho - Note that she only drops 295x mon.Gamemaker: Ebisu's Gamble (common bow) - Drops whether you kill or spare her.Butterfly of Benevolence trinket (accessory) - Drops only if you spare her.Do you need more help as you continue your adventure throughout Sengoku Jidai era Japan? We've got you covered, so just take a look at our Assassin's Creed Shadows guides hub.",

    "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/assassins-creed-shadows-tea-bowls-locations-for-rikyu/2900-6374/",
    "description": "Are you hoping to find all Tea Bowls for Rikyu in Assassin's Creed Shadows? There are seven of these items scattered all over Japan, so it might seem like a tall order at first. However, you should be able to acquire everything that you need with a bit of exploration and campaign progression.Where to find all Tea Bowls for Rikyu in Assassin's Creed ShadowsThe tea bowl items are part of a quest aptly called Tea Bowls for Rikyu. However, the quest itself won't be available right from the get-go as there are a few requirements. Here's the gist:You must complete the arc to hunt down the Golden Teppo, a member of the Shinbakufu.You meet an NPC named Sen no Rikyu along the way. You also need to find other stuff, like the kosode and tea merchant.It's up to you whether you confront Otama or Wakasa. Either way, you have to deal with the Golden Teppo.Continue and finish the entire arc until Naoe and Yasuke meet up to reach Act 2 of the campaign.Sen no Rikyu should then appear as an NPC in the People of Yamashiro section of the Objectives board. Where to find Sen no Rikyu and the tea bowls?To start the Assassin's Creed Shadows Tea Bowls for Rikyu quest, you have to return to Sen no Rikyu's home in Kyoto. It's just south of the northern kakurega building and west of the Imperial Palace.After talking to Rikyu, you're asked to find seven tea bowls that he can add to his collection. Here's a quick summary:Six of these can be purchased from merchants in various towns. Each one costs 125 mon.The seventh and final item can be acquired once you defeat The Wise, a member of the Shinbakufu group. Where to find the Osaka ornament vendor?For our first example, let's head over to Sakai in the Izumi Settsu region. The ornament vendor in this village is fairly close to the Port of Sakai marker. Talk to the NPC and buy the tea bowl for 125 mon. Map of locations of the remaining tea bowlsThe map above shows the locations of the other Tea Bowls for Rikyu in Assassin's Creed Shadows. These are all from ornament vendors in various villages and settlements:Yamashiro: Kyoto - Fairly close to the southern kakurega building.Omi: Sakamoto - North of the kakurega building and Sake Brewery.Omi: Azuchi - From the Sokenji Pagoda fast travel point in the city proper, keep going southwest across the bridge until you stumble upon the vendor's stall.Wakasa: Obama - Thanks. Make your way to the city and tag the Obama Guard Tower fast travel point. Then, go directly southeast to reach Kara Market.Tamba: Kameyama - Right next to the kakurega building, which is actually further south of the main castle. The Wise and the Classic Tea Bowl CollectionTo get the last Assassin's Creed Shadows Rikyu tea bowl, you need to eliminate The Wise, one of the members of the Shinbakufu group. To be fair, this task might take you a while:Continue progressing through the campaign by taking out Shinbakufu members and tackling Yasuke's and Naoe's personal quests. Eventually, you'll see information about The Wise in the Objectives board.You have to go to the Yamato region, which has level 35 enemies.Next, you must talk to a shrine maiden named Fuyu. She's in Omiwa Shrine in the Nara Heartland sub-region.Proceed further into this arc, where you'll broker a peace treaty between two warring clans.Later on, the true identity of The Wise will be revealed. To no one's surprise, it's the monk leader Joken Hokkyo.Chase down Hokkyo and kill him. You'll then receive the Winds of War legendary kusarigama and the Classic Tea Bowl Collection. Should you invite your friends or enemies for the tea ceremony?Return to Sen no Rikyu and hand over all the items that you've collected. You're then asked if you want to invite friends or enemies for the tea ceremony. Here's what happens:Invite friends - There's a short scene where Naoe, Yasuke, and Junjiro have tea together.Invite enemies - This leads to a mini-quest called Fish in a Barrel. High-value targets from the other assassination boards (i.e. non-Shinbakufu members) may appear in the courtyard, and you can take them out. In our playthrough, we only ended up with one target. We can't confirm if this is due to having cleared other boards or if it's just a randomized selection.Regardless of what happens, killing the target causes Sen no Rikyu to scold you for your actions. Tea Bowls for Rikyu quest rewardRegardless of your decision on who to invite to the ceremony, you'll still receive the following rewards:Tea Room - Building for your hideout.Standard Tea Accessories - Hideout decoration.Basic Tea Accessories - Hideout decoration.Sen no Rikyu - Unlocks Sen no Rikyu as an additional scout.That does it for our guide on how to complete Tea Bowls for Rikyu in Assassin's Creed Shadows. If you like roaming around in Japan, then you probably want to tackle other quests, such as The Butterfly Collector.",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What could you use most right now: cuddles with pets, a hot cup of tea or a nap? I’m drinking a hot cup of tea at the moment, and I’m not too sleepy, so I’ll take the cuddles from the pets. 2. On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the highest, how concerned are you about AI? Girl. As someone who named her daughter after a great science fiction heroine who rises up to help defeat the robots, I’m going to give this a solid 10. I’m freaked out, man! 3. Something unexpected that happened to you recently? Well, I saw a bobcat out of my window when I was at work last week! (See the pic at the top.) The campus has a lot of[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 872 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Rosie, being scientifically oriented, has an affinity for baking. She appreciates the precision and thinks of it like working in a lab, except one where you’re able to sample the fruits of your labor. We’re all so excited because she opened her new French bakery, La boulangerie de Rosie, in Novato this weekend. I know! Very exciting. Unfortunately for Rosie, Marnie was her baking assistant, but it doesn’t look like that’s going to work out because Marnie has no regard for recipes or measurements…or really, any kind of precision. Actually, Rosie didn’t come up with the idea for the bakery herself. Tabs, as you know, was very forwarding thinking, and toward the last years of his reign he planned to open a high-end cat bakery that also catered to humans (but also cats), and Rosie borrowed the idea. We can safely assume that if Tabs had gotten the business off the ground, it would have been a huge success. Yup, everything that cat touched turned to gold. 💛 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 856 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
