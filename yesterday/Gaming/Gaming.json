    "description": "Overwatch 2 Season 16 is now live, adding the new damage hero Freja and the new competitive mode Stadium. To kick off the season, there is a new collection of cosmetic items to get, the Dokiwatch skins. These are skins designed to invoke the imagery of magical girls, a genre of anime and manga, like Sailor Moon, but instead of tying in an official license, Blizzard has made its own. There are nine skins total, featuring different magical girls and a few adjacent skins, but collecting all of them will require a few different purchases, unfortunately.The main Dokiwatch Mega bundle on the store costs 5,900 coins (about $60), and includes five skins: Dream Sheep Orisa, Glitter Mei, Heart of Grace Widowmaker, Heart of Passion Kiriko, and Nocturna D.Va. The bundle also includes name cards and player icons, but these five skins can be purchased individually for 1,900 coins directly in the hero gallery. However, there are a few more Dokiwatch skins to get elsewhere in Overwatch 2.An additional two skins are available in the battle pass: the Heart of Strength Brigitte skin at tier 20 in the premium pass and Hero of Heart Tracer at tier 40 for free. The Juno Heart of Hope Mythic skin is in the Mythic shop, with a base cost of 50 Prisms, with additional tiers of customization available for more Mythic Prisms, which can be earned via the battle pass or purchased for real money.Lastly, there is one final Dokiwatch skin, the Heart of Courage Freja skin, which is available exclusively in the Ultimate Battle Pass Bundle, which costs $40 and includes the premium battle pass, the Demon Rocker Illari skin, 2,000 coins, and 20 tier skips. This means that in order to get all of the skins you would need to purchase the ultimate battle pass bundle and the megabundle, for a grand total of $100. Below you can see every Dokiwatch skin, along with other cosmetics like icons and sprays. Heart of Courage - Freja skin Heart of Hope - Juno skin Heart of Strength Hero of Heart - Tracer skin Dream Sheep - Orisa skin Glitter - Mei skin Heart of Grace - Widowmaker skin Heart of Passion - Kiriko skin Nocturna - D.Va skin Winged Heart - weapon charm Glitter Mei - name card Heart of Grace Widowmaker - name card Heart of Passion Kiriko - name card Nocturna D.Va - name card Dream Sheep Orisa - player icon Glitter Mei - player icon Heart of Grace Widowmaker - player icon Heart of Passion Kiriko - player icon Hallow Hearts Persephone - player icon Ariadne's Heart - spray Dream Sheep Orisa - spray Glitter Mei - spray Heart of Passion Kiriko - spray Nocturna D.Va - spray",

    "description": "Daybreak has a routine now for its Norrath franchise that is as regular as the turning of the seasons… and maybe more regular given how climate change has been mucking things up.  There is a game update in the spring, an expansion at the end of autumn, and a special rules server as summer approaches.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. How many lip products do you typically carry with you: 1-2, 3-5 or 5+? Lately, I’ve been pretty streamlined, so it’s usually one or two things – lipstick and a gloss! 2. What nail colors have you been into lately? Pale opaque baby blues. Perhaps I’m having a mid-’90s nostalgia moment, ha! Remember that baby blue nail polish by Hard Candy? I couldn’t get enough of it. 3. Which would you rather do: an afternoon outdoor picnic or late night stargazing? Afternoon picnic because I’m pretty sure I’d be too sleepy to stargaze late at night, hahaha! 4. Scrambled or sunny side up? Both! But if it’s scrambled, I’ve got to be the one making the eggs. I’m weirdly picky about my scrambled eggs.

    "description": "So, yeah. One of Tabs’ little-known side hustles would have made him even MORE super popular around the neighborhood but, unfortunately, he had to keep his real identity under wraps. I mean, he wanted to promote it, but his contract with Easter Bunnies Inc. had an airtight NDA. So it was a pretty thankless job, but still…highly rewarding. As you can imagine, Easter was a favorite around here. All of us at Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC were always busy during that critical first quarter trying to maximize the company’s gravy quota, so by Easter we were worn out. That’s when Tabs would always decide on his spring goals, and when they were good, it definitely helped set the tone for the rest of the year. 😹 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 858 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
