    "description": "While InZoi does many things that The Sims does not, some aspects of Krafton's new Early Access life sim are very similar to features we've seen The Sims 4. One of these is InZoi's Ambitions system, which is essentially identical to The Sims' Aspirations. You choose an ambition, like becoming an expert artist, and then you'll have to complete a series of related tasks that award a currency that will allow you to buy upgrades. But while these systems look the same, in execution they actually function very differently. Here's what to know about InZoi Donuts and hoe to get more of them.Table of Contents [hide]InZoi donuts explainedInZoi donuts explainedIf you've spent time with The Sims 4 lately, InZoi's Ambitions will be very familiar. When you're creating your Zois, you pick an Ambition for each of them, and each Ambition includes three waves of tasks. If you pick the Pro Musician Ambition, you'll start by buying an instrument and playing it three times; wave two requires you to play drums ten times, and play any instrument while feeling sentimental; and wave three requires you to max out your instrument skill (all instruments fall under this one skill) and play guitar 20 times.Each wave of tasks that you complete will award you with NyanCoins, with each successive wave of tasks giving more than the previous wave. And then you'll spend those NyanCoins on donuts, which you can purchase from the \"Meow Coins\" menu on your Zoi card. But these aren't just any donuts--these donuts come with a timed buff.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "As pleasant as it might be for us if the world were exclusively full of nice people, that's not necessarily the right formula for an entertaining life sim video game. If all the characters in InZoi only gave each other compliments, it would get boring immediately--fortunately, that's not what InZoi is like at all. Here's a full explainer of how InZoi karma works.Table of Contents [hide]InZoi karma explainedInZoi karma explainedIn InZoi, you can be a good Zoi or a bad Zoi, and your behavior is reflected by your karma level. InZoi's karma is not something that has a direct parallel in The Sims 4--the closest mechanic would be its reputation system, but that's based on what other characters think of you, and this karma system is more like the game's judgment of your behavior.With that being the case, it's best to think of InZoi's karma as akin to a dark side/light side meter in a Star Wars game, or the renegade/paragon system from Mass Effect. The more your karma slides one way or the other, the more options you'll have to do things that correspond with your alignment. If you have bad karma, you'll unlock new methods for being a jerk, like picking fights and shoving people to the ground for no reason. You'll even be able to start committing crimes, like robbing ATMs. You can go to jail for that kind of thing, though, so be careful.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Which is the hardest to do: engage in small talk with strangers, ask for directions, paint your toe nails or cook a meal without a recipe? For the life of me, I can’t make most meals without having a recipe to follow. I’m not one of those people who can cook from the heart and throw ingredients together with abandon. I need precise measurements (because one person’s pinch of salt might mean something completely different to someone else) and guidelines, otherwise I’ll short circuit. 2. Do you wanna go dancing at the pink pony club? Sure, why not? I’m gonna keep on daaaaaan-cing… 3. What language would you like to be fluent in: French, Cantonese, Arabic or sign language? All of them. LOL! I think sign language[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 872 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Yup, the boss lady wants us to tighten our belts around here. It looks like the economy is slowing down a bit, so no more Tuesday all-you-can-eat turkey or free five-egg omelets in the cafeteria. She wants everyone in the company to cut back, and that includes Rosie and Marnie. Starting immediately, there will be no more kibble showers! The leadership committee is hard at work identifying opportunities for process improvement… Rosie and CHO (Chief Hugging Officer) Whiskers are upping the napping quota by a staggering 15%! That means more hugs for everyone! Or else!!! It’s gonna be rough for a while. Hopefully things turn around soon. I have faith in Rosie’s leadership ability. And where many leaders lack empathy, she really goes out of her way to show she cares about people. It’s very motivating! Marnie is totally fired up about it. I sure wish Tabs were still around because he was so good at business. He would have known how to navigate a downturn better than anyone. 😊 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict,[Continue reading...] The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 855 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
