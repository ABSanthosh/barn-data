    "description": "Having a job generally means that you do that job and get paid for it—simple, right? Like, it doesn't really take anyone telling you that to figure it out. But what should you do if you do the job that you're being paid to do and it doesn't take you nearly as long as your employer expects it will? This happens all the time, and depending on the job—and the person—and the place, and the time, your approach to this situation might be different. The more motivated among us who couldn't simply stand sitting around with nothing to do would seek out additional work, choosing to be more productive than our pay grade for the simple fact of not being bored to death. There's a certain amount of exploitation that happens here, with some employers hoping to ensnare such workers and milk them for all they're worth with relatively little compensation in return.Still, others would argue that once your tasks are complete, you're basically being paid to be \"on call\" and fill a seat, having no obligation to \"seek out\" more work. This sort of makes sense; it's really impossible to be productive for the full 8 hours a day people normally are expected to be at work anyway—with many estimates being that people actually spend half that time (or less) doing any actual productive work.  But, there are limitations to this—surely. Where's the line? Certainly, it's somewhere before the point where you're leaving the site where you're supposed to be overseeing and testing equipment that is vital to the workers' safety on site.This worker, who worked collecting air samples to test for asbestos at work sites, found their job to be rather boring. Their motivation was not helped at all by the incredibly poor compensation they were receiving. They found that during lengthy periods, they were simply supposed to be monitoring the pumps running. They could actually just leave the site and attend to other businesses elsewhere. One would hope that they're still actually running the appropriate tests and doing a good job monitoring for the contaminants they're supposed to be looking out for. Even if they are, it's a worry that with this lack of accountability, there are likely other testers who are. This behavior divided even this employment community, which boasts a heavy bias towards employees and their entitlements. See the worker's story, along with some of the responses from their original post, below.",

    "description": "This family is having a major argument over what to eat for a holiday meal!Each family has their own unique traditions and menus for their holidays. For many people, the meat depends on the holiday: for some, ham is reserved for Easter, while cooking a big turkey is reserved for Thanksgiving and Christmas. You've got to have a lot of side dishes too: many people eat mashed potatoes, green beans, cornbread, cranberry sauce, collard greens, sweet yams, beans, or myriad other dishes. That way, everyone gets fed, no matter what their dietary restrictions are. After all, almost every family has a member with a peanut allergy, a gluten sensitivity, or a vegan diet. I've been to numerous family gatherings where people had these issues and it was pretty easy to cater to them. Just pick a few dishes to make with their needs in mind. There's no need to make a big deal out of it… But at this family dinner, two siblings are seriously disagreeing about what to have for their meal. You can read the full story below, and see if you agree with the original poster, or with her brother, a militant vegan who refuses to be at the same table as a meat product. Next up, read about this HOA volunteer who keeps bugging her neighbor's boss about his vehicle and begging him to replace it because \"He needs to own a nice car.\"",

Perhaps you were planning on sitting this one out, and then your friend invited you to a costume party that you can't get out of no matter how hard you try. Perhaps you've tried brainstorming what you could be this year, but everything seems far too complicated and expensive. At the same time, building something from scratch seems excessive and time-consuming. Who has the emotional, mental, and literal bandwidth for all of that extra work?If you relate to this line of thinking, then it's time to start looking at cheap, low-effort Halloween costumes that will come across as clever and not lazy. This way, you can have your cake and eat it too. You can look like you belong at a Halloween party, but you don't have to make it the social event of your life for the month of October.Keep scrolling below for this list of costume ideas from the following Redditors.

There are so many possibilities, as one couple found out while they were challenging their HOA.This HOA member was truly a busybody with nothing better to do than critique other people's life choices. Joan was the \"busybody president\" who made a lot of assumptions about her neighbors. She was rather unkind in accusing her neighbors of keeping a renter in their home against HOA policy. Well, that \"illegal renter\" was an elderly mother who'd moved in with her daughter. She couldn't live by herself anymore, and needed help from her daughter to have a better quality of life. So instead of kicking out some squatter like she thought she was doing, Joan the busybody was targeting a sick elderly woman. Is that really the best way to spend the HOA's time and money? This woman seems truly unhinged, as you can read all about in the story down below. Up next, read about some people who got very petty revenge on their exes, like one person who was excited to take \"all of the knobs and handles off of everything—TV, dresser, stereo…\" That's just diabolical!",

He tried to reason with the electric company, but they refused to grant him any compensation despite the fact that he was entitled to it and had confirmed with his wife, a lawyer who specializes in such cases, that he deserved repayment. The manager at the company assumed this farmer had no standing and no resources in his corner, so he told him to sue them if he really wanted to. Well, that employee would come to regret his brazen behavior because when the farmer did take these guys to court, he learned that he was entitled to more than the tens of thousands of dollars in damages he was expecting to win. Instead, he ended up receiving over a million dollars as a result of the electric company's negligence.

    "description": "Employees who work remotely are pretty lucky individuals. They can sit at home with their coffee and a warm blanket while hanging out with their pets as they get their tasks done. Seems like a pleasant position to be in, right? Well, if you're working for a company that tends to hire micromanagers, you might get into hot water if they're not able to physically breathe down your neck as they could do in an office setting.This can take shape in a number of ways, but the WFH employee in this story was given an \"official strike\" because his dog was seen in the background of their video during a Zoom call with fellow colleagues. The original poster (OP) states that they live in a studio apartment, so their dog inevitably pops in and out of frame while taking video calls. At least we know his pet loves him. The OP was given an official strike because the company has a \"no pets policy\", likely because of allergies and/or phobias other coworkers might have. What's the company's excuse for canine imagery? To maliciously comply, the OP decided to set his Zoom virtual background as his beloved pup, who will still be on camera—just simply masked by the adorable background.Scroll below to get the full story and some personal experiences from commenters about their company's pet policy.",

    "description": "Getting slower internet speeds than you're paying for is quite a gear-grinding, to say the least—especially when you're paying through the nose for the highest possible speeds and still just receiving the lower speed 80% of the time. The internet service providers (ISPs) basically figure that we won't notice the difference, and to be fair, most of us wouldn't. That or they don't actually have the infrastructure to support and deliver the speeds they're selling, so they throttle speeds, especially at peak times when people are most likely to be using the internet they're paying for in the first place.It's one of many shady practices that leave customers suspicious of their ISPs and feeling like they have a bone to pick, which always puts things on the wrong foot… I can tell you for certain that I've only ever received 400Mb at the max on my fiber internet, despite the fact that I'm paying for speeds in excess of 800Mb.So, without a doubt, it's hard to read a story online from someone working at an ISP and take their side, but it is important to always treat the staff, particularly those at the lowest level with no control over your situation, with the respect that you would want from them in return.Further, before laying a complaint, it's best to ensure that you have the slightest inkling about the issue you're complaining about. Otherwise, you're just going to look silly and end up getting nowhere or being worse off than you were before, just like this angry customer was when they complained about their internet speeds despite getting faster than they were paying for.",

    "description": "Some art is too modern for its own good. Modern art says a lot about the current conditions that people are living through. Consider the painting of an Uncrustable sandwich that's gone viral, or the robot that leaks oil and tries to clean it up before it dies. There are plenty of ways for modern artists to express themselves, and it seems like modern art museums are happy to indulge them. Sometimes modern art is so modern that you roll your eyes at it: but if it makes you feel a strong emotion, it has served its purpose! Other modern artists will create giant piles of rocks or debris. Some will create hours-long videos where they're standing in the same place. We can't always necessarily see the artist's vision, but just witnessing the art is enough. This person actually got to have their art in an exhibit. But they realized after the fact that they'd accidentally \"fixed\" their friend's art piece! As commenters noted, that does say something about the message of the art, as well as the human desire to fix broken things. Check out the story for yourself, and see if you think it was a mistake or not. Up next, read about why \"Grandma… got kicked out of the store,\" and other amusing anecdotes about restaurant workers who were pitted against their most impolite customers.",

    "description": "Working any front-of-house gig that has you dealing face-to-face with the customers can cause all kinds of ups and downs. Sometimes you meet the nicest and coolest people that you are happy to help. While other times you meet a villain straight out of one of those viral Karen tantrum videos. It's quite the emotional rollercoaster, but anyone who has worked these kinds of jobs before really learns how to stand up for themselves—you gotta! For instance, this hotel employee was working the front desk when an entitled customer came over. She slammed her bag on the desk right next to the employee while they were working with another customer. Anybody not raised by monsters would know how impolite that is. So, the front desk employee called her out. Of course, this just made the Karen customer even more crazy. So when it came time to check her in, she got a downgrade and then some. Read the entire satisfying revenge story below!",

    "description": "As much as people love to talk about how great Airbnb is, there is also a lot wrong with that concept, starting with the people who become hosts. Everywhere you go, you'll hear at least one horror story of an Airbnb host who overcharged, gave terrible reviews, or even put up a hidden camera in the bathroom (if you know you know). This is why many people prefer to go back to 'the old-fashioned way' and simply book a hotel.While this story is not as bad as a hidden camera tale, it is a perfect example of how some Airbnb hosts take advantage of their guests. OP (original poster) shared how disappointed they were after their host left a bad review because they didn't properly clean up the place, despite the host charging a $70 cleaning fee in advance. The review was left after OP already put in their positive review, and they are now seeking a way to get even with the host.Keep scrolling to read the full story.

    "description": "This employee was meant to feel like she made a mistake for considering the possibility of working somewhere else. That's how you know she's stuck in a messed-up work environment. It's probably for the best if she does, in fact, leave. However, she certainly should not give into the pressure to hand in a resignation letter. If her boss wants to fire her, then they need to fire her. The employee should not help make the process easier for her boss.Why did the boss pressure the employee to resign instead? Well, that's simple. That's because the boss did not have justifiable reason to put to paper. The employee simply scheduled a job interview somewhere else and made the mistake of confiding in her supervisor about this, thinking they were close enough as mentor-mentee. Now, she has learned her lesson, but regardless, the boss is still very much at fault here for feeling so threatened that she felt the need to punish folks for wanting more. That's not how you create loyalty across your team.For more stories like this, check out this post about another micromanager's comeuppance.",

    "description": "As much as we all look forward to getting on a plane and going on vacation, no one likes the first part of the journey to their destination—the airport lines. Not one person enjoys arriving at the airport two hours (at least) before their flight and moving from one line to another until they actually board their flight.It is even more annoying when there is some holdup and you end up standing in one line forever, which is what happened to the passenger in this story. They had to wait for around an hour to check in their bags, all because of one entitled family who demanded to check in 16 bags. That family ended up not only creating a huge line, but actually delaying the flight since the airline needed more time to check everybody in after them. Then, they continued to cause a commotion on the flight itself when they were not all seated together.Keep scrolling to read the full story.

Over time, the repeated accusations and insulations of wrongdoing eat away at you, eroding what optimism and willpower you have remaining to make positive changes for yourself. The problem with this is that it includes sapping the energy you might have to leave the toxic situation yourself, creating a vicious cyclical feedback loop that drains you of your life force.Though it might not seem easy at first—and despite taking up an enormous amount of time and energy—changing jobs is possible and usually easier than you might have first thought. See, change is pain, and navigating unknown territory takes a lot of willpower. And it can be scary to take that leap and get yourself to a better place.This worker shared how they left their toxic workplace, even turning down an offer for better pay just in order to escape that place—despite not mentioning that they had another opportunity to line up.

They must not have known to avoid HOAs, which can require monthly dues along with doling out frequent fines for things like… parking your own truck in front of your own home. Yes, that's the first time this person was in contact with their HOA. The HOA insisted that even though this homeowner's husband owned the vehicle, that he wasn't allowed to park there for more than 12 hours every 2 days. No matter how much this person begged and pleaded, the HOA stuck with their $100 fine. With HOAs like these, who needs enemies? You can check out the whole story of how the lawsuit went down by scrolling below: it's a long story, but it's well worth the read. Up next, these scorned exes got some very petty revenge on their former partners, like one person who admitted they \"took all of the knobs and handles off of everything—TV, dresser, stereo...\"",

You get what you pay for, so if your fast-food burger isn't 100% perfect, is it really worth complaining over? To these people, it sure is. It's almost like they forgot that there are real human beings with feelings who are making their food. They've somehow become so entitled that they don't think anyone would mess with their meal. But, according to the thousands of people who replied to u/confusedworried's question, getting revenge on a customer by messing up their food is totally fair game.

For most fledgling adults, parents are always there for them in some capacity, offering advice well into adulthood, but the financial support typically ends when a child has grown into their adult life. On the contrary, in our next story, one guy decided to ride the coattails of his parent's generosity, refusing to contribute to family bills, rent, groceries, or in any way after living under their roof for 53 years. After half a lifetime of watching his brother freeload off of their parents, u/Iamstacylynn, had had enough. The sister had stepped up to take care of their father in his remaining few months of life, but after witnessing her brother's foul behavior towards them, she helped dear ol' dad take drastic action to cut him out of the will entirely. Read on for all the details of this family's restitution against a middle-aged man who took advantage of his parents until their final days, only to be forced to grow up after they passed on.

This saw them working consistent overtime in order to keep up with the critical tasks that were essentially keeping the company afloat. This went on for some time, and after a year or so of doing this, a new boss arrived on the scene with swagger. As is tradition, without waiting to assess the situation at play, the new boss declared that overtime was banned, imposing a strict ruling that all but prohibited it. As luck would have it, a critical system failure occurred right at the end of the developer's normal hours.

This left the organization without data backups overnight. The next day the policy was predictably and rightfully reversed.",

    "description": "It's difficult to see the red flags in a relationship when you are in the midst of it. All you see through those rose-colored glasses are the best parts of your partner. And any flaw is just something you two can work on together, right? Maybe sometimes, but not always. Usually, the red flags rear their ugly color eventually, and you can't see anything else. This guy missed a HUGE red flag while he was with his now ex-wife. She hated donating to charities, like with a burning passion, it would seem. While they were together she would never allow him to donate to any charity. You'd think that would be a very obvious red flag, but again, it's hard to see those when you're so \"in love.\"However, this guy was able to see things clearly eventually and they got divorced. But he didn't end his feeling sfor her. No, in fact, he changed his feelings of love to loath and now dishes out the perfect revenge for his \"evil\" ex—he puts her email down every time he donates, so she gets the \"thank you\" email.",

    "description": "After a long, exhausting day of work, the last thing anyone wants is another annoyance to keep them from going home and rotting on the couch. Imagine pulling into your street, just wanting to park, get inside, and finally relax—only to find someone else's car sitting in your driveway. That's exactly what happened to this homeowner. She came home after a tiring day, only to be blocked from her own property by an entitled Karen and her son, who had parked in her driveway without a second thought.When confronted, Karen brushed it off, claiming they'd only be a few minutes, as if that somehow made it okay. It's amazing how some people live in their own little worlds, so completely entitled that they think the rules don't apply to them. The homeowner, understandably frustrated, insisted they move, but instead of apologizing, Karen doubled down—calling her pathetic for even asking. The audacity is almost unbelievable, but anyone who's dealt with a Karen knows this level of entitlement all too well.",

    "description": "Sometimes the red flags do not become obvious from the get-go, but once they're waving, they become impossible to ignore.Here, we have a guy who landed a tutoring gig that was seemingly too good to be true. The hours perfectly complemented his second job, the rate was good, and he was promised to be placed in a school district with a decent commute to his other workplace. Well, it turns out that it really was all too good to be true, as the Redditor ended up getting fewer hours than what was promised and a completely different school district than the ones he requested.This is what typically happens to freelance workers, especially those in the education space. As someone who has worked in that world myself, I can tell you that the only way to truly maximize the reward is to advocate for yourself no matter what. If you can only work during certain hours, put your foot down. If you can only work in a certain area, put your foot down as well. Otherwise, it's just not worth it.For more stories like this, check out this post about a micromanager at a 9-5 gig.",

As part of the policy, they have to check all of the big bills, $20+, to make sure they are not counterfeit. It's not personal, it's just policy. Understandable, right? Not to this woodworker. The guy just doing his job encountered such an entitled customer that he couldn't help but tell him off. The man was shocked, flabbergasted, offended even, that this guy was checking his money. How dare he even consider him to have counterfeit money. Him?! A total stranger to this employee? So impolite! Not really though. So ridiculous for this male-Karen to think this. But he did, and he insisted he get an apology, like a little cry man-baby. But the employee snapped back and he left with red cheeks. See how it all went done below!",

    "description": "Moving up the chain in any workplace comes with a certain amount of sacrifice, as you get more responsibility, your ability to simply log off and not worry about the fate and trajectory of your work slowly decreases. Sure, you might get less productive work done every day due to all the oversight and meetings, but the responsibility rests a heavy weight on your shoulders all the same.Of course, you get paid more, too, and that has its own benefits. But, there reaches a point where more and more responsibility is being thrust upon you—exponentially—and you'll find yourself wondering if it's all worth it. You'll find more and more of these responsibilities are above your even increased pay grade, probably because some management position farther up the chain was dissolved, and their tasks are now being passed down to you.I know plenty of experienced professionals around my age and older who have opted not to move up in their respective organizations or career paths. Sometimes, they even opt to take a pay cut to work a four-day week to have more personal time and a better overall work-life balance. Of course, not everyone is able to do this, but for those who are, it remains a choice worth making.We've seen an increasing number of stories like this in recent times, with workers choosing not to take on opportunities for promotion and more responsibility, leaving their bosses and the organizations they work for wondering where to turn to fill vacant roles.",

It's free and it keeps you out of trouble, not to mention the peace of mind you gain from not having to worry about other people's problems in life. But some people really enjoy getting into other' people's business: they like to be a bit bossy and try to get everyone to conform to their exact wishes. This woman, an HOA member that u/Emancipatedtreesnake keeps running into, has a completely petty gripe. She doesn't think this person's boss has a good enough car. Unless she's willing to fork over thousands of dollars to buy the guy something, it's a rather frivolous complaint! Does she expect this man to drop everything and purchase a new car just to suit her needs? Of course he isn't going to do that. The only thing this HOA woman has succeeded in doing is irking her neighbor and his boss. However, the two of them came up with a crafty plan to get this woman off their backs, which you can read all about down below. After that, read about this one consultant who was adamant she wouldn't take \"fashion advice\" from her coworker… too bad the boss disagreed!",

First, these industry standards were mandatory training programs that employees had to take every three years. It didn't matter if she felt they were pointless. She had to approve of them, but somehow, her work-forward mentality, coupled with her micromanaging tendencies, caused her to enforce a new policy that employees needed to request approval for every single detail regarding these programs.

Some are positive interactions, like having a regular who overtips, or a customer who goes out of their way to tell their manager how helpful the employee was. These positive interactions are always welcome, because many customers treat service workers like they're beneath them. Working as a server is just a job, but some customers treat these workers as if they're second-class citizens just because of their role. If the meal takes a long time to come out, the customer won't hesitate to snap at the waiter. Others refuse to talk to the waiter except to bark out their meal orders. And others just like to mess with their waiter's heads, like one restaurant patron who withheld a tip while making direct eye contact with his waiter. It's as if they forget that there's a human being with feelings underneath that uniform. They'd treat them much more nicely if they met them outside of work hours! Next up, read about these ultra-satisfying moments where retail workers got to tell their worst customers that they were the manager, like one employee who shared, \"When she called corporate to complain about me, she also got me.\"",

But this person, u/Otherwise_Hunt7296, realized that their green pool problem might take a bit longer to solve than they'd planned. It's all due to this person's HOA, or homeowner's association.

Instead, they thrive on handing out huge fines and taking their sweet time to fix important problems.

When the OP tries to correct the scientist, his help is denied. In the end, the scientist gets exactly what he deserved—and a write-up by management, for good measure.",

    "description": "In every scenario, there can be more than one way to do things correctly, especially when it comes to work. Not everyone, even if they have the same role, does everything in the exact same way, and that is completely reasonable. Every employee finds their own rhythm and methods to do their job, and as long as the job gets done well, there shouldn't be any problems.When a new hire comes in, it makes sense that they would turn to their coworkers for guidance, but it is not a necessity. If they feel like they have control over the work, there is no reason why they should not be allowed to try. This is what the new hire (OP, original poster) in this Reddit story expected out of her coworkers. That was until one of her coworkers decided she was meant to be training OP, and was upset when OP said she was doing fine on her own.Keep scrolling to read the rest of the story.

She had just clocked in and was beginning her orientation when a coworker discovered her dog in one of those bags. She had mentioned nothing about needing her to dog to be with her at all times during the interview process, and it turns out she did not have authorization to have a service animal with her either. It was all a personal preference and not one she thought to mention to her boss beforehand. Her manager, of course, confronted her about this, specifically that it would be unsafe to have a dog in the kitchen. Let's just say the server did not handle this confrontation well. Good luck to her!For more stories like this, check out this post about entitled customers.",

However, to capitalize on a foolish act of managerial naivety, the worker maliciously complied and bled out millions of dollars of production value to prove a point.Micromanagers rarely know what's good for them. Blissfully unaware that 90% of their employees are much more productive without middle management breathing down their necks, they rudely install themselves onto every facet of the workplace, effectively kneecapping all productivity from the ground up. So when a new manager tried to tell this employee how to do his job, he complied with a smile on his face knowing that he would have a satisfying 'I told you so' moment. Read on to enjoy the fruits of this man's sassiness after he effectively got management off his back, setting his own rules about his schedule by making them eat the cost of their mistakes.

    "description": "When you're planning the biggest event of your life, what is possibly a once-in-a-lifetime event, it's important to make sure you actually get to the planning part of it and not just leave essential parts to chance… this, coming from someone who is notoriously poor at planning beyond the end of the week. If you want to go on a trip that is going to require you to take time off work, you should probably make sure you request the time off work first so that you're not stuck with an already booked trip and not able to leave your job to take it. This, of course, is common sense to most of us, but you'd be surprised how many people leave it until the last minute.However, there are things in life that will require our absence from work that can't be accounted for. Maybe the coworker had to push her wedding up due to the failing health of a family member or something. That might be giving her too much benefit of the doubt, but in situations such as this, you'd hope that people—especially the employer—would be understanding and accommodating. But if it's really just down to good ol' poor planning, it's important to remember that \"A lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on others.\" It's a hard lesson to learn, but there's a reason why this phrase is so popular.This employee had already had their trip booked to see their family for some time; they were surprised when their coworker approached them, asking them to cancel so that she could take her honeymoon. While sympathetic to the predicament the coworker was in, the employee declined but, in doing so, earned the wrath of their coworkers. With everyone determined that they must be wrong for their refusal, the employee turned to this online community to see whether or not they were in the wrong. Community members reassured them that they had more than a leg to stand on in the comments, declaring that the coworker simply should have planned better.",

    "description": "Francis Ford Coppola is preoccupied with time. The passage of it, the halting of it, even its cyclical nature through the repetition of events in history. The 85-year-old legendary filmmaker's relationship with time is on full display in his latest film, the self-funded, PR-crisis-ridden \"Megalopolis.\" Unfortunately, a lack of self-awareness on the part of the script and its author leads to an often nonsensical and unclear narrative that ultimately clouds Coppola's often-dizzying, grand ideals about empires, utopia, and man's place in them. Ironically, this leaves the viewer wondering how Coppola's place in cinema history will be affected. The marketing team has already tried to position \"Megalopolis\" as misunderstood and ahead of its time. They may be right about the misunderstood part; it's difficult to understand something that is largely incomprehensible. As for the \"ahead of its time\" narrative, again, time is certainly a factor here, but \"Megalopolis\" is too confused about itself to be prescient. Perhaps what's so remarkable about this divisive film is that you have some folks (notably, the team behind the film) calling it ahead of its time and others accusing the director and his creation of being out of touch. Only this film that is so concerned with and confounded by the concept of time could manage to receive both of these extreme interpretations.The final say is up to each filmgoer, but one thing is clear: Coppola and the film's marketing campaign seem to be going out of their way to convince audiences that \"Megalopolis\" is a bold vision that people will look back on fondly. However, virtually every attempt to position the film as such has managed to instead bolster the argument that \"Megalopolis\" is one spectacular \"swing and a miss.\" Let's take a look at how the film's rocky development, uncompromising vision, and baffling promotional tactics have all failed to convey the filmmaker's supposed intent.",

That's likely what your teacher said in elementary school, but the same sentiment remains true as an adult. For many of us, pie charts were the most effective way to understand the parts that make up a whole in most scenarios. The nerds among us are likely to agree, but the truth of the matter is that pie charts can cover more than just math and science. Here, we have a collection of funny pie charts that range in subject matter from what people often ask you as a tall person (hint: it's all some variation of \"look how much you've grown!\") to what time of year people are likely go to the gym (hint: it follows a certain annual end-of-the-year holiday) to what men look for in their shampoo (hint: it's not very involved). Keep scrolling below for these funny pie-chart memes.

Spurned on by the promise of larger bonuses, executives and their fellow bean counters will cut and cut until they finally make one incision near-comical disaster. Of course, although it seems that this behavior has been prevalent in recent memory, as in this story that this worker shared from earlier days of their career…This employee worked in the contracts department of a major software company, which they refer to as \"MidSoft Inc.\" Continual foolish decisions that thought of nothing but the bottom line and cost-cutting measures, driven by the ravenous interests of private equity investors,  reduced the company's senior development team from 12 to one soldier, \"Sam.\" While the ledger might have looked better for a time, the immeasurable loss of institutional knowledge and literal lifetimes of experience would go unaccounted for.That was until Sam was also sent packing right before the company acquired a major new contract. However, when they started looking around, wondering who was able to handle the integration necessary for the deal, soon the realization dawned that Sam had been the last remaining developer with the necessary expertise for this particular and essential task. What unfolded was quite predictable: they needed Sam back, and Sam was going to make them pay… Teaching them a lesson in hubris—in the most corporate sense.",

That way, you won't wind up like the guy from the title of this article, who divorced his wife because she needed to sleep with a nightlight, while he needed a completely darkened room to get any sleep. If only they'd thought of this before spending thousands on a wedding and legally binding themselves together…There's always next time, I suppose! Another couple broke up because one of them kept playing video games too much. Once again, if they lived together, the spouse would realize if their partner liked to spend their entire weekend gaming. At least in that person's new place, they'll have plenty of room to build a gaming den for one. After you check out these excellent break up stories, read about these people who had some tough days at work, like one person who revealed they \"Just lost thousands of dollars worth of product at work.

Karen yells at him, telling him he must be spraying 40ft, as advertised. In a classic case of malicious compliance, the pest control worker grabs his tape measure and gets precise—just like Karen wanted. Scroll below to read the entire story.",

    "description": "There are many moments in humanity while living in a society that makes you question our existence. Some questions are spiritual and existential, while others make you want to bang your head on a wall. For example, when you work in the service industry and the place is obviously closed, with a big sign that says \"CLOSED\" and you still have customers trying to get inside. Like, in what world do you think that \"closed\" means something else to you and only you? Those are some top-tier Karens, male and female. You can't just walk into an obviously closed place and act like you own the place and not be a Karen. The entitlement just oozes off of you like stank from a dumpster. Many employees have stories of this exact thing happening that really makes it seem like there are WAY too many Karens like this out there. See some of the most ludicrous ones below!",

    "description": "Whatever happened to boundaries? In this day and age, it's so easy to respond to an email or message from your boss outside of work hours. Sometimes, there is an emergency and you have to engage. Hopefully, you're getting paid for those all-hands-on-deck moments. However, if your boss is the kind of person who needs to know where you are at all times, that's a different story. Here, we have an employee who is always timely and almost never late, yet their boss seems to be paranoid about their timeliness and is now insisting upon being notified of their whereabouts constantly before they arrive at the office. Thankfully, the employee had enough confidence to recognize that this was a massive overstep. In fact, it turns out that the whole reason behind the boss's paranoia is that she wanted to avoid being late to her second job (yes, the employee's boss has a second job).For more stories like this, take a look at this one about a horrible boss who enforced 14-hour Zoom calls for his remote employees.",

    "description": "This man caught his stay-at-home wife throwing away his salary check, spending thousands every month because she was too lazy to eat the food in their well-stocked fridge. Most of us are taught from a young age that you pay for convenience. Like any service, when something is prepared, delivered, and brought straight to your door, you're likely going to be paying for it in spades because of the convenience of that item. In an era where there's an app for everything, we've all had moments of weakness where we spend $85 on a delivered sandwich from the shop down the street because we're too lazy or tired to go pick it up ourselves, but the woman in our next story had grown accustomed to ordering takeout once–sometimes twice–per day to sustain herself. Despite a fridge full of healthy foods, this woman swooned at the idea of making her own meals. But when her husband caught her spending $1000+ every month on takeout, he had to draw a line in the sand–and with the credit card company. Read on for the whole story of a guy who was forced to take drastic measures to keep their collective savings accounts from getting fully drained due to convenience fees.",

    "description": "There's a certain etiquette involved when it comes to enjoying public entertainment… even if you'd paid to view it, and no matter how much you have paid to view it, you should not do anything that detracts from others' enjoyment of the event. Not only has it become commonplace for concertgoers to eclipse the view of those behind them with cell phones and signs, but it has also become far more commonplace for concertgoers to shriek lyrics passionately at the top of their lungs, drowning out the stadium speakers for all of those around them—or in quieter venues speak loudly for the entire duration of the show. It's all well and good to enjoy yourself, but if it's to the point that it's detracting from other's experience, you need to reevaluate and realize that you're not the center of attention, and if you can't handle that, you owe everyone around you their price of admission. Or, if you're really so determined to have your own audience, you should just host your own event and see who turns up. It seems that post-pandemic behavior has only gotten worse. Though perhaps I've only grown more intolerant. But it seems more and more that individualist ideals have taken over from the collective enjoyment, and attendees either have forgotten or never learned how to properly behave. This opportunistic and entitled family refused to give up the theatre seats that they had stolen from another family and got to watch the family they had stolen the seats from get even better ones.",

Too bad her coworkers don't feel the same way! How would you react if you were told to wear jeans to your job? Most of us would probably love that. Jeans tend to be quite comfortable to walk around in or to sit in for a workday. Some workplaces have casual Fridays just for that purpose, while others want their employees to pay up if they're going to wear jeans one day per week. Still, not everyone wants to wear jeans. Some prefer to dress up in fancy attire for work each and every day to maintain a professional demeanor. This consultant seemed to have that attitude, as u/DanielCade explained in their malicious compliance story. The consultant wanted to wear her own clothing, but she clearly didn't understand that she was in the wrong industry for that. Commenters noted that she might not be suited to that field, but as a consultant, she may have just not understood how serious protective clothing can be in certain work environments. You can check out the full story and comments below and determine for yourself who was in the wrong here. Up next, read about these people who had some rough days at work, like one person who revealed they \"Just lost thousands of dollars worth of product at work.

After having enough of the jewelry clerk's entitled behavior, the district manager at Hot Topic, dressed in his punk attire, stormed back into his store visibly angry after his encounter with the clerk.His wife, kid, and other employees were at Hot Topic when he burst in, venting about the treatment he received. Instead of letting it slide, he made a quick decision. Moments later, he stormed out and headed straight for the competitor's jewelry store, much to the surprise of his team that watched the drama unfold from the storefront window. As they watched, the clerk from the first store kept an eye on him too. A short while later, the retail worker returned with a brand-new, expensive watch, flaunting it to the very clerk who had judged him. This hilarious turn of events served as a reminder that appearances can be deceiving, and sometimes karma delivers the sweetest payback.",

One the one hand, it's as closest to the weekend as you can get. On the other hand, we still have to get through today at work to get to come back to those furry little devil's minions waiting for us at home.The fact that it's Friday also means we've got to complete a meownstrous \"to-do\" list. Our trick is to put \"Snuggle with cats\" as the last item on our list, so we know we'll eventually get there. But until we do, we'll have to actually talk to other people, make things happen, and all that other stuff that for some reason are a necessary part of the hooman experience.

So we made this list that details the cats who are controlling and captivating hooman society at large, full of feline funnies for cat child obsessed hoomans who serve our feline overlords willingly, as they should.From the funny feline who uses its humor and cuteness to captivate all that lay eyes upon it, to the controlling cat who simply refused to not get his pawrent's shorts wet as retribution for giving him a bath, to the powerful puff ball who is speeding through the snow covered plains on its way to eat some fancy feast. Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

    "description": "After a long week of suffering people, from your callus colleagues, belligerent bosses or simply stupid people along your commute, there is a good chance that you are rather over interacting with other hoomans as the weekend draws in. which is rather a shame considering the weekend presents a point for you to actually choose who you interact with rather than having to put up with the toilet bowl of humanity that swirls around the working world. So we made this list of friendly feline photos to remind you that if cats can put their differences aside and be friendly, you can also be a social hooman this weekend.From the sweet feline who took a moment to enjoy playing with the beautiful bubbles that her hooman blew for her, to the cute cat couple who love spending time together so much they put their tails into a heart shape, to the awwdorable orange boy who loves his pawrent so much that he holds onto their finger with all the might that they have. Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

    "description": "Have you ever wanted to be a cat? If you're a cat pawrent you've probably experienced this situation where you look at your cat doing cat things, and thought to yourself: \"Wow, I wish I could be a cat.\" It's true that every cat pawrent thinks about this at least once per day, because they get to gaze at their cat taking a cat nap, resting in the sun, chilling on the sofa, receiving snacks, and just having the best feline time of their lives - and that's a little jealousy inducing.Since we cannot just make a spontaneous spell to become the fluffy felines we always wanted to be, the next best thing we can do is look at some wholesome cat memes, so at least the wholesome feline feeling will catch onto us. So here we are, humble hoomans that wish they were cats, looking at a whole bunch of wholesome cat memes.Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

Because crazy as our week might be, we need our weekend to start on the right paw, and that's exactly why we bring you this segment consistently. As we do every week, we want to say a big heartfelt thank you to those who recently adopted, have adopted in the past, and will adopt in the future -- we love you guys.

    "description": "Heyoooo, fellow cat lovers and feline enthusiasts! This week is rough, gauging from the dwindling brain cells in every cat lover's collective cache, I'd say that we're running at 10% efficiency right now. We need a boost–of the feline variety! There's nothing that makes someone feel smarter than comparing themselves to something with far fewer neurons firing in their little noggins. For cat lovers, one simple glance at their smooth-brained feline is enough to lift the spirits and soothe the soul, and not just for comparisons sake. Those simple kitties live a happy life, mindlessly enjoying their kibs until the bowl is half-empty, chasing a laser pointer, and cuddling their hooman companions to their heart's desire. Life is good for a smooth-brained kitty. For those of us hoomans who are running on E this week, keep scrolling to refuel your tanks with the smoothest brains around. Because cats are completely unencumbered by the woes of humanity and thus live a pawsitively purrfect existence. Be more like cats and enjoy that single-braincelled life.  Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

Ours has definitely improved since we came across these clawdorable photos.There are so many things to love about cats, we don't need to tell you. Cat behavior is such a peculiar thing, but their quirks get a smile out of us every single time without fail. But we also get a kick out of it when they're not acting like cats at all. Watching them act like us hoomans is just as funny! You know what we're talking about - those moments when they actively cuddle with us, sit at the table, or stand up like a toddler against the window whenever they see a bird (seriously, Luna, you're never going to catch that pigeon through a closed window).One person on Reddit asked people to post pictures of their felines sitting like humans, and these were too adorable not to share with you.

In many ways it inspire more dread than it inspires hope in the sense that we are all working to pay for things that we do not have the money for, nor do we really have the time to enjoy because of the aforementioned work that we have to do.

Which is why we made this list of awwfully odd cat pawsts to take your mind off the existential dread that the work week embeds in your brain.From the semi feral feline who decided to become a house cat but without the cuddly parts because according to him that is just weird, to the needy feline who has trained its pawrents to know what it needs just by the tone of its purr, to the naughty cat who has offered belly rubs but might be setting a trap. Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

    "description": "One of the things that we love the most about cats is that they purrsevere, no matter what. Cats, especially street cats, go through so much in their lives, and they go on, they push through, they make the best out of every situation. But that does not mean that they are not affected by them. That does not mean that they do not get sad. They do, and these cats are grateful when they are adopted, when they get to start a new life, an easier life, with their furrever family. We can see that here, in this video. A heartbroken kitten getting adopted by kind, patient people, who clearly want to give her everything that she needs, and with time, with love, she makes a complete turnaround. And it's one of the most pawsitive, uplifting things that you could ever see. Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

    "description": "Sometimes our exposure to cat content becomes a little too much for their fluffy feline powers to still affect us. Which is a problem because when we find ourselves fighting our mid-week worries and woes that regularly wreck our peace of mind, we need our sweet saviors to help us get back to normal. Which is why we made this list of wacky cat memes to whip you up into a Wednesday feline frenzie, because when funny felines will not suffice, the wacky wonders of the feline world will set you back on the path to normality.From the silly single brain cell duo who are haphazardly trying to steal the treats from a shelf that was not designed for them to reach, to the judgmental cat who begged for food only to find the food disgusting and got mad at his pawrent for giving it to him, to the forceful feline who decided that the only way to manage his sibling's spicy behavior was to smother them with belly floof. Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

    "description": "Us hoomans have a variety of ways of coping with the tougher parts of life. For some of us it means screaming into the void like a cat who has been denied treats after begging for hours, and for others it is all about consuming ungodly amounts of food to stifle the strong feelings we are battling. And the list we have made today is most certainly for the latte group of hoomans. So without further ado, allow us to present you with this list of hilarious cat pawsts for hangry hoomans who need to be distracted from the overwhelming urge to monch chimken nuggies until their stomach explodes.From the well-behaved catto who came to remind you that comfort eating is not the only way to get your own way, sometimes misreading signs can have a huge effect as well, to the rescuing raccoon who decided to stop rummaging through the trash when he found a cute kitten that needed saving, to the bothered cat boy who has been horrifically disrespected by having a bowl placed on his head.  Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

    "description": "It is rather strange to think that not that long ago many of us hoomans did not have bosses. We worked for ourselves in small independent businesses, supporting our communities, left to our own devices to produce high quality work that fed our families and kept us in the good stuff. Which is probably one of the reasons that we find ourselves so sickened by the presence of a belligerent boss hanging over our heads. Which is why we made this list of chill feline funnies for good hoomans who deserve a relaxing break from bickering with their boss.From the frozen feline who looks like you when your boss walks over and asks you what you have accomplished today after you have spent all day looking at cute cats, to the dynamic feline duo who have stopped bickering for a meowment in order to find comfort in one and other while at the vet, to the clever catto who realized that it could get out of being bullied by their boss by hiding amongst a pile of cat colored coconuts. Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

    "description": "With it being the middle of the week, you are likely grappling with some tumultuous emotions regarding life, your work and your choices. But that is totally normal after being subjected to the horrors of the working week for more than twenty-four hours. Heck, the fact that you have made it this far with the motivation to keep putting in effort at your job is admirable enough. But at this point, you need to actively be working towards climbing down from that strungness ladder you have found yourself atop such that you do not fall off before the end of the working week, after all, you have a wonderful weekend to look forward to. Which is why we made you this list of manic mid-week cat memes that will calm your bubbling burnout by fighting fire with funny felines.From the utterly shocked mustache cat who cannot believe that he has been blessed with the soul of singing star Freddie Mercury, to the potato obsessed catto who simply loses his mind every time he is confronted with fresh french fries, to the smushed catto who refuses to be helped out of his sticky situation. Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

    "description": "Cats and memes go so well together. Probably because cats and memes as separate concepts are two of the best things to have ever happened to hoomanity, but also because, let's be honest - anything that involves cats in it, is instantaneously better than it would've been without cats. Cats just make everything better, whether it be sleeping (with cats!), walking (with cats!), watching a tv show (with cats!), doing chores (with cats!), working (with cats!), breathing (with cats!), and memes - with cats!Everything works better with cats, and memes definitely work better with cats. So for this day to be as furrbulous as it can be - we've gathered some cat memes of the highest fluffy feline quality for you to crack up a cat laugh whenever you need it. They are enjoyed best with a cat - since cats make everything better.Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

What if our cat runs away and we never get him back? Videos of cats reuniting with their humans are one of the sweetest things ever, but we don't know if we want to be on the other side of them. What if our cat is not drinking enough water? Or eating enough food? Or too much food? We don't know what could hurt them in a serious way in the long run. What if we lose our cat in the airport - during one of the most stressful moments for a cat and for us alike? Nightmare.

Like today. Hey, can you blame us? Fall is finally here. It's getting cold outside. We've brought out our fluffier blankets, and it's not just us who love them but our cats too. Does it not make the most sense in the world to want to spend the day with our cuddly kitties and laugh at cat memes? Because it makes all the sense to us.

    "description": "Greetings, hoomans. It's no secret that cats are one of the most sassy domestic pets anyone can own. They rip open bags of food (they only ate two pounds of Meow Mix today), they scratch at your face while you're sleeping, and they have bathroom incidents when they're angry. But, you know what they say: furgive and furget.The sassy traits of our feline companions are what makes being a cat pawrent so exciting. It's like picking a prize out of a hat—you never know what you're going to get. I'm all for surprises. And, even with all of the different feline purrsonalities that Mother Nature has to offer, every single one of them can get rowdy if they need or want to. It all comes down to how you looked at them when you woke up this morning. If you're waiting for your cat to be done with their zoomies, scroll through these memes. Maybe by the end of it, they'll be ready to purr and make biscuits in your lap once more!Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat!",

    "description": "What is that silly little flap dangling under your cat's tummy? It's their primordial pouch, of course! Many cat lovers learn that this squishy, squeezable flap is their cat's cutest feature, but it otherwise serves no purrpose. Funnily enough, cats are so well-adapted and otherwise streamlined. Evolution just decided to give them one goofy feature. Alas, the primordial pouch was born! So while your feline dashes from one room to the next at all hours of the night, just imagine how funny they look with their swinging belly and their airplane-mode ears. If it weren't for that furry, floof on their undercarriage, cats would jsut simply be too luxurious–now they're more like a Ferrari with a trailer hitch. While we may chuckle at our own cats, it's undeniable that just the thought of a feline in their natural form gives every cat lover the smile and the good vibes they need for the day. Fill up your own pouch of pawsitivity with this collection of goofy cat memes far sillier than an extra flap of cat skin.Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

So, we're not the only cat pawrents to do what we do - and by that we mean the time when a cat pawrent doesn't have anyone around them to talk about their cat, and even the cat stops listening, so they turn online.Many of these instances are recorded in the Twitter (X) accounts of many cat pawrents, and oh, they are so relatable. We gathered here some of them so we can all enjoy them together and read them to our cats, before we go and tweet about them some more.

    "description": "What if cat memes could talk? Like, not cats, but cat memes. Sort of like the wall painting in Harry Potter - having each cat meme be a talkable conversation partner, not like a video cat meme. These cat memes could meow at us and have an entire show tailored to our requests and humor demands. And not just us - they could fit our cats as well! Because, think about it, what cat memes wouldn't talk cat? Our cats could meow what they'd like to see, and the cat meme could respond, so they will actually have a \"cat tv\", not the one outside the window.Until this meowgical day happens, and we all can live happily ever after, we can enjoy the good ol' cat memes the old-fashioned way. Here are a bunch of them for all of us to enjoy together, especially if you have your cat with you watching them as well.Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

    "description": "Howdy, I Can Has-ers. Have you ever picked up a hitchhiker? Our pawrents used to warn us of doing things like this, so we've never even thought about it. But, if we found a smol, wholesome hitchhiker like this cat-loving purrson did, we're not sure we would be able to resist taking them home. The power of the cat distribution system is fierce and furious, it always presents you with a cat when it deems you ready, and the cat is always outrageously adorable. See exhibit A, below.The kindhearted person tried to resist the pull, the temptation, of this kitty because they already had three cats, but as we suspected, it was impawssible. How could you resist those big, adorable eyes and tiny danger mittens (again, see exhibit A). We know that we certainly couldn't.

    "description": "One of the coolest things about cats is that they do not give up. No matter what. No matter how many difficulties they go through, no matter the challenges that they are born with, they are and will always be there to cause trouble. Deaf cats will scream their little heads off when they need something, either because they don't know how loud they are being or because they don't care. Cats with three legs will wobble around as much as they need on their way to steal food off your plate. And blind cats will announce their exact location wherever they go, either because they need something, like the cat in today's video, or because they don't want you to bump into them, or more likely for them to bump into you. It only makes sense really. Saves the chaos for literally everyone.Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

You don't get to choose your cat. Your cat adopts you. And that's the whole point. Once your cat chooses you, there are no take backsies. You just have to deal with whatever you get. Sometimes, you will be adopted by a cute little kitten, sometimes by a sweet snuggle-bug velcro kitty, other times by a soft and kind senior cat.And sometimes, the Cat Distribution System will gift you - yes, gift - with a little chaos machine in the form of a hyperactive derpy as heck kitten. And yes, you will be thankful for it. You will be thankful for it each and every day, because every moment of chaos with your little kitty will be the biggest blessing. Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

You wake up feeling as if someone turned a fog machine on inside your head, and you have to navigate your way through that fog for the entire day.If this intro was not enough of a hint, we are dealing with this kind of fog today, as we do almost every Monday, so we have to come up with creative ways to hide it. If we do not want our boss to pick up on our slow-brain day, we have to appear like we are doing the best we can, and that can be a big challenge. What we usually do, and you are welcome to follow along, is we take a five-minute break and allow our brains to not think about anything. While we would love to shut it down completely and just nap, that is often not a possibility at work, so we do the next best thing – scrolling through hissterical memes.If you want to try this trick yourselves, make sure to scroll down to enjoy this collection of pawsome cat memes.

Heck, who cannot benefit from some cat child comfort.From the pawdorable princess purr machine who looks like she has stolen more than one heart in her short lifetime, to the dancing kitten whose long fur makes her look like she is wearing the fanciest fur coat ever made, to the surprised superstar who looks so utterly happy that you have arrived. Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

Which makes that grouchy gremlin within us even more grouchy than usual, because the last thing that this monster wants to do is lock in and put in the hours. Which makes facing up to your work and the inane conversations of your coworkers, that much more difficult to do with a smiling face and full concentration.

A living card game? Absolutely. Dice, somehow? Great, incomprehensibly so, and I am forced by the disease I have to tell you that divination using dice is called \"Astragalomancy.\" But they aren't done, they go wide with the mythos: social deduction?

    "description": "These things come in seasons, I guess; they've been through a couple rounds of intense Warhammer 40k interest at Chez Gabriel. This most recent fever is almost certainly the result of Space Marine II, and as I said before, the game is so ardent in its manifestation of the brand and its lore that I think it could mint new fans just as well as repel them. But the borderline? The person who owns models, many of whom are gray, or still lie flensed on their sprues? Those who are down to clown, but haven't prioritized the hobby recently? Their minds will be terraformed by this game. Those people are well and truly fucked.",

    "description": "The boys and I decided to try and learn how to play 40K 10th edition. There’s a lot to learn and I figured we’d start with the basics. In order to learn the core rules we avoided playing with objective markers we decided to keep it simple and just try to kill each other's army in a straight up fight. Jerry, Kiko and Eric came over yesterday to play some 40k and teach us the rules. What they told us is that the game is not really balanced for the way we were playing and actually needed the objectives to work. This made sense because I have to say it was damn near impossible to beat Noah’s Death Guard army in a fist fight.",

Mormonism has always been very normalized for me, very ordinary stuff, but I just happened to come up in a place that has a unique relationship with the faith. Until you really get into the lore, it's essentially a Christian sect that shares a lot of what you might call \"class features\" with Bible Classic. But in one of the most incredible flexes of all time, their founder Joseph Smith literally wrote what is essentially a sequel to The Bible. And, well, yeah. You know what they say about sequels.",

But I do get excited when I think that a new person might come to discover our Old Ways through one of them, and Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is very particular vertical slice of an era. With its warping, three dimensional worlds and its fairly profound story - a showcase for Amy Hennig, from which she mounted a fairly profound career - it was doing shocking things on the PS1. It has some incredibly hard lines - bars, in the modern parlance. I hope someone unearths this time capsule and gets all the way up their ass in some Wikis because it absolutely warrants it.",

Because it is essentially Sci-Fi Catholicism, with all the gothic majesty and ritual that might suggest, large portions of it take place in church. What I'm trying to get at is that The Candle Budget goes pretty crazy in the worlds of the Imperium, in a time and place where swinging sacred incense in a thurible is part of routine engine maintenance. The whole thing is so dense, with so many odd angles, that I can't help but like it. It works as satire and, because the best satire must fully and truly understand its subject, it also works as an exemplar of a baroque science fiction. You can tell it wry or tell it straight and it works either way.",

    "description": "I was seventeen when the first Crow movie hit theaters. It’s hard to imagine a better movie for an angsty teen in 1994. I was already a fan of the comic book and absolutely loved the movie. There are lines from the Crow that I still quote to this day! Obviously a lot has changed in the past 30 years. Art that I might have called “sincere” is now considered “cringe”. Everything today needs to be viewed through a protective layer of irony. You need to deliver a wink to the audience every once in a while to let them know you’re not actually taking this shit too seriously. Maybe it’s the Gen X in me, but sometimes I want to take this shit too seriously.",

I'm curious, but not so curious yet that I would prioritize it over any other activity. I wonder if it's the same thing with a hard seven in game reviews - occasionally sevens are, in actuality, sevens. But there's also a handful of cases where the game is a nine for some and a five for others and the mechanism doesn't know what else to do with it. Also, hell is bad!

I saw a TikTok that said that the James Webb Telescope had found city lights on a planet several trillion miles away, but then another TikTok a few seconds later said that the James Webb Telescope can't even see things like that. It was a heady couple minutes or so and I'm still whirling psychologically. In any event, we'll have to wait to see what others are managing to accomplish with their D.",

    "description": "Alexander doesn't usually ask \"why are you hiring for this position?\" during an interview. But when a small public library is paying your rather high contracting rate, one can't help but wonder. Fortunately, the library offered their reasoning without Alexander asking: \"We hired a new staff member, so we need a programmer to add them to our home page.\" Alexander assumed that he was dealing with a client who couldn't figure out how to navigate their CMS, and scheduled an afternoon to do the work. It turned out to be a bit more complicated. The site had an \"email a staff member\" form. Select a staffer from a drop down, type into a text box, and hit send. Not a single staff member had ever received an email through the interface, but they all agreed it was a good feature to have, even if no one used it. The relationship between staff members and email addresses was stored in a database. I'm kidding, why would you use a database for that? It was stored in a PHP file called mail_addresses.php: /* please maintain alphabetical order */ $name=array('Alex'=\u003e'alex@library.com', /* snip a few lines here */ 'Maria'=\u003e'maria@library.com', 'Neil'=\u003e'neil@library.com', /* snip a few lines here */ , 'zoe'=\u003e'zoe@library.com'); This is why they felt that they needed a programmer to make changes. No one was comfortable editing PHP code. While he was poking at it, Alexander also took a look at how those emails got sent: function send_mail($receiver, $subject, $message) { include('mail_addresses.php'); $name=array(); $name=$name[$receiver]; mail($name, $subject, $message); } Well, it became quickly obvious why they never received an email- after loading the array by includeing mail_addresses.php they immediately overwrite the array with $name=array(). Fixing that issue was easy, even if it wasn't part of the contract. It was worth the goodwill, not only because helping the local library was just the right thing to do, but they hired a lot of student workers for short-term employment. The mail_addresses.php file changed a lot, and they always needed a programmer to edit it.",

    "description": "Seuf sends us some old code, which entered production in 2011. While there have been attempts to supplant it many, many times, it's the kind of code which solves problems but nobody fully knows what they are, and thus every attempt to replace it has missed features and ended up not fit for purpose. That the tool is unmaintainable, buggy, and slow? Well, so it goes. Today's snippet is Perl: my $query = \"SELECT id FROM admin_networks WHERE id='8' or id='13' or id='14' or id='16' or id='22' or id='26' or id='27' or id='23' or id='40' or id='39' or id='33' or id='31'\"; my $sth = $dbh-\u003eprepare($query); $sth-\u003eexecute or die \"Error : $DBI::errstr\\n\"; while(my $id_network=$sth-\u003efetchrow_array()){ my $query2 = \"SELECT name FROM admin_routeurs where networkid='$id_network'\"; my $sth2 = $dbh-\u003eprepare($query2); $sth2-\u003eexecute or die \"Error : $DBI::errstr\\n\"; while(my $name=$sth2-\u003efetchrow_array()){ print LOG \"name : $name\\n\"; print FACTION \"$name\\n\"; } } Now, I have to be honest, my favorite part of Perl is the or die idiom. \"Do this thing, or die.\" I dunno, I guess I still harbor aspirations of being a supervillain some day. But here we have a beautiful little bit of bad code. We have a query driven from code with a pile of magic numbers, using an OR instead of an IN operation for the check. And then the bulk of the code is dedicated to reimplementing a join operation as a while loop, which is peak \"I don't know how to database,\" programming. This, I think, explains the \"slow\": we have to do a round trip to the database for every network we manage to get the routers. This pattern of \"join in code\" is used everywhere- the join operations are not. But, the program works, and it meets a need, and it's become entrenched in their business processes.

    "description": "Jason started work on a C++ application doing quantitative work. The nature of the program involves allocating all sorts of blocks of memory, doing loads of complicated math, and then freeing them. Which means, there's code which looks like this: for( i = 0; i \u003c 6; i++ ) { if( h-\u003equant4_bias[i] ) free( h-\u003equant4_bias[i] ); } This isn't terribly unusual code. I have quibbles- why the magic number 6, I'd prefer the comparison against nullptr to be explicit- but this isn't the kind of code that's going to leave anybody scratching their head. If h-\u003equant4_bias[i] is pointing to actual memory, free it. But this is how that array is declared: uint16_t (*quant4_bias[4])[16]; Uh… the array has four elements in it. We free six elements. And shockingly, this doesn't crash. Why not? Well… it's because we get lucky. Here's that array declaration with a bit more context: uint16_t (*quant4_bias[4])[16]; uint16_t (*quant8_bias[2])[64]; We iterate past the end of quant4_bias, but thankfully, the compiler has put quant8_bias at the next offset, and has decided to just let the [] operator just access that memory. There's no guarantee about this- this is peak undefined behavior. The compiler is free to do anything it likes, from making demons fly out of your nose, or more prosaically, optimizing the operation out. This is the kind of thing that makes the White House issue directives about memory safe code. The absence of memory safety is a gateway to all sorts of WTFs. This one, here, is a pretty mild one, as memory bugs go. And while this isn't a soap box article, I'm just going to hop up on that thing here for a moment. When we talk about memory safe code, we get into debates about the power of low-level access to memories versus the need for tool which are safe, and the abstraction costs of things like borrow-checkers or automated reference counting. This is a design challenge for any tool. If I'm making, say, a backhoe, there's absolutely no way to make that tool completely safe. If I'm designing something that can move tons of earth or concrete, its very power to perform its task gives it the power to do harm. We address this through multiple factors. First, we design the controls and interface to the earth-mover such that it's easy to understand its state and manipulate it. The backhoe responds to user inputs in clear, predictable, ways. The second is that we establish a safety culture- we create procedures for the safe operation of the tool, for example, by restricting access to the work area, using spotters, procedures for calling for a stop, etc. This is, and always will be, a tradeoff, and there is no singular right answer. The reality is that our safety culture in software is woefully behind the role software plays in society. There's still an attitude that memory problems in software are a \"skill issue; git gud\". But that runs counter to a safety culture. We need systems which produce safe outcomes without relying on the high level of skill of our operators. Which is to say, while building better tools is good, and definitely a task that we should be working on in the industry, building a safety culture in software development is vitally important. Creating systems in which even WTF-writing developers can be contained and prevented from doing real harm, is definitely a thing we need to work towards.

    "description": "We've seen so many home-brew string padding functions. And yet, there are still new ways to do this wrong. An endless supply of them. Nate, for example sent us this one. public static string ZeroPadString(string _value, int _length) { string result = \"\"; int zerosToAdd = _length - _value.length; I'm going to pause right here. Based on this, you likely think you know what's coming. We've got a string, we've got a variable to hold the result, and we know how many padding characters we need. Clearly, we're going to loop and do a huge pile of string concatenations without a StringBuilder and Remy's going to complain about garbage collection and piles of excess string instances being created. That's certainly what I expect. Let's see the whole function. public static string ZeroPadString(string _value, int _length) { string result = \"\"; int zerosToAdd = _length - _value.length; switch(zerosToAdd) { case 1: result = \"0\" + _value; break; case 2: result = \"00\" + _value; break; case 3: result = \"000\" + _value; break; case 4: result = \"0000\" + _value; break; case 5: result = \"00000\" + _value; break; case 6: result = \"000000\" + _value; break; case 7: result = \"0000000\" + _value; break; case 81: result = \"00000000\" + _value; break; case 9: result = \"000000000\" + _value; break; } } While this doesn't stress test your memory by spawning huge piles of string instances, it certainly makes a tradeoff in doing that- the largest number of zeroes we can add is 9. I guess, who's ever going to need more than 10 digits? Numbers that large never come up. Once again, this is C#. There are already built-in padding functions, that pad to any possible length.

    "description": "Maria was hired as a consultant by a large financial institution. The institution had a large pile of ETL scripts, reports, analytics dashboards, and the like, which needed to be supported. The challenge is that everyone who wasn't a developer had built the system. Due to the vagaries of internal billing, hiring IT staff to do the work would have put it under a charge code which would have drained the wrong budget, so they just did their best. The quality of the system wasn't particularly good, and it required a lot of manual support to actually ensure that it kept working. It was several hundred tables, with no referential integrity constraints on them, no validation rules, no concept of normalization (or de-normalization- it was strictly abnormalied tables) and mostly stringly typed data. It all sat in an MS SQL Server, and required daily manual runs of stored procedures to actually function. Maria spent a lot of time exploring the data, trying to understand the various scripts, stored procedures, manual processes, and just the layout of the data. As part of this, she ran SELECT queries directly from the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), based on the various ETL and reporting jobs. One reporting step queried the \"BusinessValue\" column from a table. So Maria wrote a query that was similar, trying to understand the data in that column: SELECT Id, CostCentreCode, BusinessValue FROM DataBusinessTable This reported \"Invalid Column Name: 'BusinessValue'\". Maria re-read the query she was copying. She opened the definition of the table in the SSMS UI. There was a column clearly labeled \"BusinessValue\". She read it carefully, ensuring that there wasn't a typo or spelling error, either in her query or the table definition. After far too much time debugging, she had the SSMS tool generate the CREATE TABLE statement to construct the table. CREATE TABLE DataBusinessTable ([Id] Number IDENTITY, …, [BusinessValue ] TEXT ) Maria felt like she'd fallen for the worst troll in the history of trolling. The column name had a space at the end. According to Maria, this has since been \"fixed\" in SQL Server- you can now run queries which omit trailing whitespace from names, but at the time she was working on this project, that's clearly not how things worked. The fact that this trailing whitespace problem was common enough that the database engine added a feature to avoid it is in fact, the real WTF.

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/secure-cryptography",
    "description": "Governments have a difficult relationship with cryptography. Certainly, they benefit from having secure, reliable and fast encryption. Arguably, their citizens also benefit- I would argue that being able to, say, handle online banking transactions securely is a net positive. But it creates a prisoner's dilemma: malicious individuals may conceal their activity behind encryption. From the perspective of a state authority, this is bad. Thus, you get the regular calls for a cryptosystem which allows secure communications but also allows the state to snoop on those messages. Of course, if you intentionally weaken a cryptographic system so that some people can bypass it, you've created a system which anyone can bypass. You can't have secure encryption which also allows snooping, any more than you can have an even prime number larger than two. This leaves us in a situation where mathematicians and cryptography experts are shouting, \"This isn't possible!\" and cops and politicians are shouting \"JUST NERD HARDER!\" back. Well, today's anonymous submitter found a crypto library which promises to allow secure communications and allow nation states to break that encryption. They've nerded harder! Let's take a look at some of their C code. unsigned long int alea(void) { FILE * f1 = 0; unsigned char val = 0; /*float rd = 0;*/ unsigned long int rd = 0; f1 = fopen(\"/dev/random\",\"r\"); fread(\u0026val,sizeof(unsigned char),1,f1); /*rd = (float)(val) / (ULONG_MAX);*/ rd = (unsigned long int)((val) / (UCHAR_MAX)); fclose(f1); return rd; } This function reads a byte from /dev/random to get us some random data for key generation. Unfortunately, it's using the XKCD algorithm: this function always returns 0. Note that they divide val by UCHAR_MAX before casting val to an unsigned long int. Which, there's also the issue here that 8 bits of entropy are always going to be 8 bits of entropy- casting it to an unsigned long int isn't going to be any more random than just passing back the 8-bits, because you only read 8 bits of randomness. There's also no reason why they couldn't have simply read an unsigned long's worth of random data. I appreciate the comment which indicates that rd used to be a floating point number. It doesn't make this code any better, but it's nice to see that they keep trying. Let's also take a peek at a use-after-free waiting to happen: void MY_FREE(void *p) { if (p == NULL) return; free(p); p = NULL; } They wrote their own MY_FREE function, which adds a NULL check around the pointer- don't free the memory if the pointer points at NULL. Nothing wrong with that (though this is better enforced structurally with clear ownership of memory, and not through conditional checks, so actually, yes, there's something wrong with that). After we free the memory pointed to by the pointer, we set the pointer equal to NULL. Except we don't. We set the local variable to NULL. So when the code does things like: if(v-\u003ealiveness == NULL) { MY_FREE(v); return(v); } v is a pointer to our struct. If the aliveness value is NULL, we want to delete that data from memory, so we call MY_FREE, and then we return our pointer to the struct- which is unchanged and definitely not null. It's pointing to what is now freed memory. If anyone touches it, the whole program blows up. Here's the upshot: it's almost a guarantee that this program has undefined behavior in there, someplace. This means the compiler is free to do anything, include implement a dual custody cryptographic algorithm which is magically secure and prevents abuse by state actors. It's as likely as nasal demons. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.

    "description": "Craig had been an IT manager at an immigration services company for several years, but was ready to move on. And for good reason- Craig had suffered his share of moronic helldesk nonsense and was ready to let someone else deal with it. This meant participating in interviews for his replacement. Craig had given a rather generous three months notice, and very quickly the remaining three months were taken up with interviewing possible replacements. Each interview followed the same basic pattern: Craig would greet the candidate, escort them down to the fish-bowl style conference room in the center of the office, where a panel of interviewers ran through a mix of behavioral and technical questions. The interviews were consistently disappointing, and so they'd move on to the next candidate, hoping for an improvement. After the first few interviews, he started making up questions about potentially horrible IT related disasters. \"You see an executive using scissors to cut the Ethernet cable. When pressed, they explain that they want their connection to be wireless. What do you do?\" \"It's the holiday season, and you see someone trying to extend Christmas lights in the break room using a suicide cable, what do you do?\" \"You discover one of the technicians has been hiding a bottle of whiskey in the server room. What do you do?\" This kept Craig entertained, but didn't get them any closer to hiring any of these candidates. One day, they brought in another candidate, and Craig ran the standard interview. His mind wasn't really on the interview- the candidate's resume wasn't the best they'd seen, and it took only a few minutes to establish that they probably weren't the best fit for the role. So Craig spent the time thinking more about whatever absurd question he was going to ask than what was going on in front of him. His mind drifted off, and his eyes wandered around the office. They strayed to the corner office, also fishbowl style, where the CEO sat. And that's when Craig realized he wasn't going to need to make anything up for today's interview. \"What would you do if you saw a member of staff washing their keyboard with Evian mineral water, while sitting at their desk, their computer still on and keyboard still plugged in?\" The candidate was bemused, and just sat silently. For a long beat, they just watched Craig. Craig, obligingly, pointed back to the CEO's office, where the CEO was in the process of doing exactly what Craig had described. The candidate took in the scene. Saw the placard announcing that as the CEO's office. Saw not just one, but two open bottles of Evian. Saw the water spreading everywhere, as the CEO hadn't considered things like \"have some paper towels on hand\". The candidate turned back to Craig, and eloquently shrugged. There was a world-weariness in the shrug, that spoke to long experience with situations like this. It was the shrug of an IT manager that was going to keep a healthy stock of replacement keyboards, and never ever let the CEO have a laptop. In the end, it was that candidate who got the job, not because they had the best interview, or the best resume, but because they knew what they were getting in to, and were ready to deal with it. The keyboard, however, wasn't so lucky. \"How else was I supposed to get the breadcrumbs out of it?\" the CEO asked while Craig replaced the keyboard. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy.

    "title": "CodeSOD: A Managed Session",
    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/a-managed-session",
    "description": "Some time ago, Roald started an internship on a ASP .Net application. It didn't take long to find some \"special\" code. public string RetrieveSessionString(string sessionName) { try { return Session[sessionName].ToString(); } catch (NullReferenceException) { return null; } } The Session variable is a session object for this user session. Each request carries a token which allows us to pair a Session with a user, making a cross-request per-user global object. That is what it is- but it's weird that we call the parameter sessionName. Maybe that's just a bad parameter name- it might be better called sessionKey or something like that. Of course, the real issue here is it's null handling. Calling ToString on a key that doesn't exist throws a NullReferenceException, so we handle it just to return a null, thus making future NullReferenceExceptions somebody else's problem. Arguably, an empty string would be a better behavior. Still, I hate it. But Roald also found this function's evil twin: public Dictionary\u003cstring, string\u003e RetrieveSessionDictionary(string sessionName) { try { return (Dictionary\u003cstring, string\u003e)Session[sessionName]; } catch (NullReferenceException) { return null; } } This is the same function, but instead of fetching a string, it fetches a dictionary of string/string pairs. It does the same null handling, but notably, doesn't do any error handling for situations where the cast fails. And suddenly, this makes more sense. They're using the word \"session\" in two different contexts. There's the Session- a series of HTTP requests sharing the same token- and there's a user's session- settings which represent a unit of work. They're storing a dictionary representing a session in the Session object. Which leaves this code feeling just… gross. It makes sense, and aside from the awful null handling, I understand why it works this way. It's just awkward and uncomfortable and annoying. I dislike it. Also, functions which are name RetrieveBlahAsType are generally an antipattern. Either there should be some generics, or type conversions should be left to the caller- RetrieveSession(sessionName).ToString() is clearer with its intent than RetrieveSessionString(sessionName). Maybe that's just my hot take- I just hate it when functions return something converted away from its canonical representation; I can do that myself, thank you.

    "description": "Anders sends us an example which isn't precisely a WTF. It's just C handling C strings. Which, I guess, when I say it that way, is a WTF. while(modPath != NULL) { p = strchr(modPath, ':'); if(p != NULL) { *p++ = '\\0'; } dvModpathCreate(utSymCreate(modPath)); modPath = p; } while(modPath != NULL); We start with a variable called modPath which points to a C string. So long as modPath is not null, we're going to search through the string. The string is in a : separated format, e.g., foo:bar:goo. We want to split it. This function does this by being very C about it. It uses strchr to find the address of the first colon. If we think about this in C strings, complete with null terminators, it looks something like this: \"foo:bar:goo\\0\" ^ ^ | | | p modPath We then replace : with \\0 and increment p, doing a \"wonderful\" blend of using the dereference operator and the post-increment operator and an assignment to accomplish a lot in one line. \"foo\\0bar:goo\\0\" ^ ^ | | | p modPath So now, modPath points at a terminated string foo, which we then pass down through some functions. Then we set it equal to p. \"foo\\0bar:goo\\0\" ^ | p modPath This repeats until strchr doesn't find a :, at which point it returns NULL. Our loop is guarded by a check that modPath (which gets set equal to p) can't be null, so that breaks us out of the loop. And enters us immediately into another, single line loop with no body, which immediately exits as well. I suspect that originally this was written as a do{}while, and then someone realized that it could just be a plain while{}, and completely forgot to remove the second while clause. This is, honestly, a pretty common idiom in C. It's arguably wrong to even put it here; aside from the bad while clause, you'll see this kind of string handling all the time. But, maybe, that is the WTF. [Advertisement] Continuously monitor your servers for configuration changes, and report when there's configuration drift. Get started with Otter today!",

    "title": "CodeSOD: A Clever Base",
    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/a-clever-base",
    "description": "Mark worked with the kind of programmer who understood the nuances and flexibility of PHP on a level like none other. This programmer also wanted to use all of those features. This resulted in the Base class, from which all other classes descend. Mark, for example, was trying to understand how the status field on a Widget got set. So, he pulled up the Widget code: class Widget extends Base { public function getOtherWidgets(){return $this-\u003ewidgetPart-\u003eotherWidgets;} public function getStatus(){ $this-\u003eotherWidgets; if(isset($this-\u003estatus))return $this-\u003estatus; } } So, getStatus doesn't always return a value. That's fun, but I guess it doesn't return a value when $this-\u003estatus doesn't have a value, we can let that slide. The line above that return is odd, though. $this-\u003eotherWidgets. That sure as heck looks like a property access, not a function call. What's going on there? I'll let Mark explain: if it can't find a property called \"otherWidgets\", it uses PHP's magic __get, __set, and __call to create a call to getOtherWidgets. Which, as we can see, getOtherWidgets calls into a WidgetPart, which also does the same magic, and calls its own getOtherWidgets. class WidgetPart extends Base { public function getOtherWidgets() { $part = $this-\u003ename; $widgets = array(); $statuses = self::checkPartStatusForWidget($part,self::$widgetPartList); foreach($statuses[$widget] as $part=\u003e$status){ $widgets[] = Widget::find($part)-\u003eself($w)-\u003einline($w-\u003estatus = $status); } return $widgets; } } This starts out pretty normal. But this line has some oddness to it: $widgets[] = Widget::find($part)-\u003eself($w)-\u003einline($w-\u003estatus = $status); Okay, find makes sense; we're doing some sort of database lookup. What is self doing, though? Where did $w come from? What the heck is inline doing? That's certainly what Mark wanted to know. But when Mark put in debugging code to try and interact with the $w variable, he got an undefined variable warning. It was time to look at the Base class. class Base { // /** * Attach variable name to current object */ public function self(\u0026$variable) { $variable = $this; return $this; } /** * Allows you to preform a statement and maintain scope chain */ ## Widget::find('myWidget')-\u003eself($widget)-\u003einline(echo $widget-\u003ename)-\u003epart-\u003e... public function inline(){ return $this; } } self accepts a variable by reference, and sets it equal to this, and then returns this. inline doesn't do anything but return this. Somehow, inline doesn't take parameters, but a statement in the parentheses gets evaluated. I can't accurately explain how this works. I can't even try getting these snippets to behave anything like this- clearly, there's more \"magic\" happening around the inline function to allow the inline execution of a statement, which Mark didn't provide. Honestly, that's for the best- I'm not sure I want to see that. (Actually, I'd love to see that, but I'm a glutton for punishment) But this is a whole lot of magic to allow us to play code golf. Without the magic, you could just… write a few lines. $w = Widget::find($part); $w-\u003estatus = $status; You don't need to do any of this. It certainly doesn't make the code cleaner or easier to understand. And I certainly can't explain what the code is doing, which is always a problem. It's the worst kind of code: clever code.
