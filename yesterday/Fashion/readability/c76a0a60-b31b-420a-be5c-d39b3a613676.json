If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Something you should know about me: I love a square-toe boot and own quite a few pairs. With its sleek and unexpected shape, the silhouette can quickly bring me into chic work mode or grunge moto boot territory depending on the style. Based on trending Google terms, lots of you love the retro-esque style as well: Searches for “black square toe boots” and “leather square toe boots” are surging as are other notable variations, such as cowboy boots and knee-high boots. From slim lace-up styles and micro heels fit for the office to Western styles and chunky soles perfect for gallivanting through the winter landscapes,  we found the very best square-toe boots for the cold-weather season. Just scroll on to find the exact silhouette that matches your style — or that pushes it to the fashion limit! DashDividers_1_500x100 Square-Toe Cowboy \u0026 Western Boots Perhaps you carted up a pair of pink or metallic cowboy boots this past summer during Taylor Swift’s extended Eras Tour or Chappell Roan’s festival performances. But if you haven’t yet, we present you with square-toe styles that will have you channeling the “Beyoncé Bowl” this winter. Go for genuine, sturdy cowboy boots from brands like Ariat and Frye for a timeless workforce pair or buckled moto styles to hone in on the Western fashion trend in a more subtle way.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Square-Toe Ankle Boots Ankle boots are a wardrobe staple — in particular, square-toe ankle boots, which offer an extra edge thanks to their unique shape, whether they’re on the chunkier or the slimmer side. We love a tried-and-true leather boot with short block heels (extra points if the heels are angular), which are a sturdy option for the winter. But you can also find this boot shape with dainty kitten heels or on-trend animal prints for more upscale occasions.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Square-Toe Knee-High Boots Everyone needs a pair of knee-high boots. The versatile shoe simply looks great with mini dresses and tights, midi skirts, or even tucked under wide-leg jeans for extra warmth. Whether you’re looking for a platform or a sleek stiletto, there are plenty of square-toe boots to choose from. You can go as bold or tame as you want, playing with fabric, color, and heel shape. (And if you have thicker calves, like myself, don’t sleep on the Dolce Vita extra-wide-calf boots.) DashDividers_1_500x100 Square-Toe Work Boots If you’re on the hunt for office-appropriate square-toe boots, you can’t go wrong with a pair of polished ankle boots. On work days, I regularly reach for my Vivaia square-toe boots (which I have in multiple colors) because of their soft sock-like fabric and comfortable block heels. But you can also opt for a higher heel or knee-high length depending on your work’s dress code.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Square-Toe Lace-Up Boots For lace-up boots, you can either go for a chunky combat pair or a delicate Victorian style. I personally can get behind both depending on the outing and outfit. But, no matter which way you sway, you’re bound to look stylish and feel super-empowered to stomp into the new year in these square-toe boots. Like what you see?
