  "description": "Image Source: Photo by Brian Babineau | NBAE via Getty Images I'm a long-time Kendall Jenner fan - I appreciate the model's fashion, taste in men (hello, Bad Bunny), 818 Tequila line, and her POV on all things life and wellness. She's just plain cool. So when I saw her style for Game 4 of the Eastern Conference NBA Semifinals, I remember thinking: leave it to Jenner to make a simple outfit look high fashion. Well, the internet apparently agreed, and influencer and podcast host Tinx sussed it out: that effortless and sheer white tank top Jenner's wearing? Yeah, that's a boys' tank from Hanes and costs less than $2. The Hanes Boys Ecosmart Cotton Tank ($10) comes in a pack of five and has a sheerness that's perfect for making a fun bra pop. We've got to hand it to Tinx for blowing the lid off this. While we can't officially confirm that this is the exact tank Jenner wore to the game, Tinx tried it on herself and, well, it looks identical. \"The other day, I was fixating on this picture because Kendall's white tank is perfect, so I asked my loving community of fellow shopaholics, 'Where do you guys think it's from?'\" she explained in her TikTok video. \"They all said Hanes. I have on good authority it's a Hanes Boys Tank.\" @tinx #greenscreen ♬ original sound - Tinx What Size Should You Get in the Hanes Boys Cotton Tank? Now, it's important to note that this tank top comes in boys' sizing. Tinx got herself a large, and it fit her well - so I'll be ordering the same. The good news is it comes pre-shrunk, so you won't have to worry about it shriveling up in the washer or dryer. And because it's designed with a smooth, tagless interior and made of 50 percent polyester and 50 percent cotton, you can count on it feeling comfortable, too. The best part? It's incredibly easy to pair with leggings or shorts - way easier to style than a bodysuit - which makes it that much more wearable. If you really want to recreate Jenner's Game 4 style, you can even add a Knicks Hat ($37) to go with it. Either way, a five-pack of tank tops will never go to waste.
