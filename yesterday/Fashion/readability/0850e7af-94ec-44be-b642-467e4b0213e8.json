Photograph: Michael Brochstein/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/ShutterstockNot to be glib about the hate-filled politics of the Trumpian right, but, whether consciously or not, these outfit choices trace a through-line between the kind of politics these figures espouse and the kind of message a pinstripe signals – elitism, wealth, power and privilege.But the fact that the manosphere and its adjacents are wearing the look hasn’t stopped the largely progressive fashion world from getting in on the trend of late. At the most recent shows, a subtle line was sketched up and down suits and overcoats at Calvin Klein in an ode to CK 90s chic. At the Coach show, watched over by Kamala Harris’s stepdaughter Ella Emhoff, pinstripe was styled in the kind of high-low petri dish way younger generations tend to throw outfits together – over boxer short-style shorts with T-shirts grunged with scribbled messages. It was there at the debut show of Haider Ackermann for Tom Ford, slinking out from underneath belted, croc-collared overcoats. As well as a glut of others: Armani, Khaite, Dior, Dolce \u0026 Gabbana, Moschino, Ralph Lauren and Stella McCartney. In Berlin, the inclusive brand Richert Beil often uses pinstripe in its gender-questioning designs.In the world of pop culture, pinstripe charts its own course. “Hot,” Charli xcx captioned on a picture of herself wearing a pinstripe Vivienne Westwood bustier earlier this year – a homage, surely, to Carrie Bradshaw when she got drunk at Vogue. A$AP Rocky would have looked like an extra from Bugsy Malone had he not had Rihanna on his arm, as he appeared outside an LA court after he was acquitted of two felony counts of assault last month.While Trump’s supporters seem to favour bolder, brasher lines, even the most subtle pinstripe is instantly communicative of entitlement and excess – it feels ramped up in an 80s-coded Wall Street way. Perhaps that is what makes it so tempting to toy with. Worn by Charli xcx, its businesslike attitude makes the boardroom seem brat. It is corpcore rather than corporate, a kind of cosplay of the office rather than anything to do with actual spreadsheets and quarterly reviews.The lines are loaded, and McGregor knows it, having used pinstripe in the past to transmit a very direct message to his opponent Floyd Mayweather Jr: written into the stripes of a suit he wore pre-fight were the words “Fuck You”. And Jeremy Corbyn also knows a thing or two about packing a punchy message in a pinstripe. On the campaign trail in Whitby in 2019, he touted a bespoke suit with his motto, “For the many, not the few” stitched into the Labour-red pinstripes. Pinstripe is clearly a stripe for all.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionTo read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with this week’s trending topics in The Measure and your wardrobe dilemmas solved – subscribe to receive Fashion Statement in your inbox every Thursday.",
