Yes, you need one. Yes, it’ll streamline your getting-ready process. Yes, your life will change forever (no, we’re not being dramatic). In the segment, co-hosts and styling duo Danielle and Alix will show you how to build (and wear) the ultimate, non-boring 29-piece capsule that’ll reflect your personal style.
