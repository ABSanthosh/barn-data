  "text": "Shakespeare would have approved. A former merchant-turned-emperor of global logistics — Jeff Bezos — married Lauren Sánchez in a city that has, for centuries, been known for commerce and its theatrical atmosphere.While the city still had its fair share of regular tourists this week, the atmosphere along the canals subtly shifted. Boats came and went silently. Workers appeared and disappeared behind gates. Questions to security were answered with intimidating stares.Throughout the week, celebrity arrivals and megayachts dotted the canals.Andrea Dal Borgol, the director of Hotel Serenissima, found himself combating rumors that Mr. Bezos had shut the city down. “He reserved all private spaces and paid for them — just as anyone else could have done,” Mr. Dal Borgol said.Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sánchez have made only occasional public appearances, passing through the black-and-white-striped canopy outside the Aman Hotel with smiles and a few waves.Tourists and paparazzi alike tried to catch glimpses, enduring the hot summer temperatures. The only objects making it through the gates at the hotel appeared to be packages from — where else? — Amazon.Cagdas Halicilar, a former electrician-turned-Bezos-impersonator from Germany, stood on a dock near the Aman, waving at the passing boats. He hoped to deliver an expensive bottle of whiskey as a wedding gift, but was unable to breach the security bubble.“It’s a dream to meet him and shake his hand,” Mr. Halicilar said. “I do this as a hobby — it’s not about money. It’s not even about attention. It just happens, totally automatically.”There were signs of protest: Anti-Bezos stickers appeared in various corners of the city, but they were quickly removed, leaving behind amusing accidental collages.Marco Giolo, a 30-year-old farmer from Venice, climbed a flagpole in St. Marks Square to hang a banner proclaiming, “The 1 percent ruins the world.”Other locals were excited. Kristina Kireeva, 33, was hoping for a celebrity sighting. “I heard Kim Kardashian landed at the airport, and I really want to see her,” she said.Arian Nababbi Ardaakani, 15, stood outside the Aman Hotel hoping to get his Amazon package signed by Mr. Bezos.Antonio Rosa Salva, the sixth-generation owner of a Venetian patisserie, was one of the local artisans who got a chance to contribute directly to the wedding, providing pastries for gift boxes made for guests. “We’re very happy and proud,” he said. “Being involved in this initiative felt like a real recognition.”The marriage of Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sánchez was just the latest in a city and country known for hosting the lavish weddings of celebrities, locals and tourists alike. Anyone who missed out on the main event could catch a glimpse of another wedding — they would just have to look around a corner.Site Index",
