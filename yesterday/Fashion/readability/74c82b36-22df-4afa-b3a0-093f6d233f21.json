  "description": "Ever stand in front of your jam-packed wardrobe, staring at more than enough clothing options, and think: I have nothing to wear? Same. But perhaps the issue isn’t that you’re out of viable outfit choices. You just need a fresh dose of inspiration — say: outfits for hot weather, perhaps — to help you see your wardrobe in a new way. That’s where Outfit Dump comes in. We supply you with enough ideas to fuel your style until the next drop comes along.Memorial Day weekend is drawing near, ready to kick off the unofficial start to summer. And what’s the only thing better than the long, leisurely, hazy days of summer? Summer vacation season, when we get to enjoy all of those things in gorgeous settings removed from the reality of our 9-to-5s. When it comes to stuffing your suitcase with summer vacation outfits, there’s a lot to consider: What’s on the itinerary? Are you in need of looks that will last you day to night, or will you have time for midday outfit changes? What is *your* travel style? Will you be dressing for comfort? Or channeling the latest fashion trends (the aspirational European summer aesthetic, for example) that feel out of place in your regular life? It’s only once you answer all of these questions that the packing (and outfit planning) can start. That’s where we come in. We’ve rounded up some of the best inspo-worthy looks — from Cowboy Carter-esque Western ’fits to milkmaid dresses, trendy butter yellow pieces, and more — from our IG feeds to help get your fashion creativity going. Keep scrolling for some summer vacation outfit ideas. Vacation outfit idea: boho vibes Take things easy this summer with a boho-inspired look. Opt for a classic flowy white top, like the scallop-trimmed top seen here, or go all-in with airy pieces covered in ruffles and fringe. A printed scarf, tied around your head for sun protection, is the perfect finishing touch.Vacation outfit idea: European summer aesthetic The European summer aesthetic is still going strong for summer 2025. Think oversized button-up shirts (or shirt dresses, as seen here), striped patterns, tailored pieces, top-handle bags, and anything else that might make for an elevated outfit you’d see on the streets of, say, Cannes or Rome.Vacation outfit idea: denim maxi skirt Keep your denim maxi skirt warm-weather appropriate and casual by styling it with a cropped top and comfy shoes of your choosing. Vacation outfit idea: dress with cut-outsA maxi dress with cut-outs at the hips and back will fit right in at any vacation destination, whether you’re strolling on the beach or checking out the local restaurants after a day of exploring. Vacation outfit idea: strapless dressA beach-ready strapless dress belongs in your vacation suitcase — especially if your travels call for a wedding guest dress. Vacation outfit idea: printed skirtGetting dressed in summer doesn’t have to be complicated. Build your outfit around a hot-weather-friendly skirt with a bold print — it won’t need much more than a white tank and a pair of sandals.Vacation outfit idea: printed dressOr try a slinky maxi dress with statement-making print instead of a skirt. Embrace the adventure of travel by opting for an eclectic pattern you might not otherwise wear — leave the safe, classic prints for home. Vacation outfit idea: romper In search of style and comfort? Look no further than a one-and-done romper. We love the trendy polka-dot print pictured here, but play to your personality with any range of colors and prints. Vacation outfit idea: pretty laceLacy, lingerie-esque pieces have been on-trend for a while now, which makes your summer holiday the time to revisit the style or jump on board if you haven’t already. Add a pretty white floral embellishment and you’re ready for whatever the day ahead holds.Vacation outfit idea: elevated halter dress Dress up your everyday beachwear with a more sophisticated take on a summer classic. This soft yellow tweed halter dress leans into the still-popular butter yellow trend.Vacation outfit idea: feminine frills Chunky sandals plus a romantic and frilly pink maxi dress? Yes, please. Look this way for all the hyper-feminine inspo you could possibly need. Vacation outfit idea: crochet Is there anything that says “out of office” more than a colorful crochet number? Vacation outfit idea: transparent layers Proof that it’s possible to combine multiple trends without doing too much, this holiday-ready look combines some summer favorites: see-through layers, crochet fabrics, and ballet pumps.Vacation outfit idea: breezy whites Crisp, breezy white fabrics are a summertime staple every season for a reason. This matching set helps the look feel more put-together. Vacation outfit idea: chic sun protection Consider this floral maxi dress and not-too-big hat your sign that protecting yourself from the sun’s rays can be fashionable. Here at Refinery29, we’re in agreement that sun protection is always chic.Vacation outfit idea: mix-and-match swimwear Mix and match your fave swimsuit with a contrasting coverup to add a playful element to your poolside outfit.Vacation outfit idea: summer blackEdgy, cool shades of black for summer on a scorching hot beach? You bet. Vacation outfit idea: drop-waist dressesDrop-waist dresses are sticking around for another season. We love the cinched bustier on this piece, which can be dressed up or down depending on how you choose to style it. Vacation outfit idea: bold neonsShine as bright as the summer sun and keep the good vibes going in head-to-toe neon. Vacation outfit idea: butter yellowPick almost any trend and you’ll instantly find it in a delicious butter yellow.  All that will be left for you to do is bask in the inevitable compliments that come rolling in.Vacation outfit idea: ultra casual Nothing says “I’m on holiday and have zero responsibilities for a week” like an oversized graphic tee and a bag big enough to fit the entire contents of your suitcase. Vacation outfit idea: denim on denim Building on the Western trend, with cowboy boots and hats galore, double denim is bigger than ever. Make like a fashion insider and play with different shapes and textures, and consider yourself Cowboy Carter ready. Vacation outfit idea: keep it sporty It may not be the summer of Challengers, but if the sporty look was ever good enough for Zendaya… This season, keep it simple with a tennis skirt and fitted tank. Vacation outfit idea: jortsLast year, it was all about the Bermuda shorts. This year, it’s all about the jort. Play with shape and proportion by pairing your favorite oversized jean shorts with a fitted top.Vacation outfit idea: denim maxi skirt Denim maxi skirts resurfaced last summer and still reign supreme. Keep things weather-appropriate and casual by styling yours with a white tank top and a pair of cute yet functional trainers. Like what you see?
