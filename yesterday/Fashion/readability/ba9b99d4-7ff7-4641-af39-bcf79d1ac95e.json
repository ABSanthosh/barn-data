  "text": "High art met high jewelry last night in Taormina, Italy, as Bulgari transformed the picturesque coastal town into a dazzling showcase for its new Polychroma collection. Renowned for its bold and joyful use of color, the Roman jeweler unveiled 600 stunning creations, including 250 new designs, 60 “millionaire” pieces, and five milestone styles. With the spectacular display, Bulgari once again affirmed its philosophy: the stones don’t choose Bulgari—Bulgari chooses the stones, selecting only the most extraordinary gems the world has to offer. The evening began with a gala dinner at the iconic Grand Hotel Timeo, where Blackpink’s Lisa, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Viola Davis, Liu Yifei, and more stars offered a preview of what was to come, gracing the carpet in Polychroma pieces designed by creative director Lucia Silvestri. Set on a terrace overlooking the majestic Mount Etna and the shimmering Ionian Sea, the ambiance was a harmonious blend of Sicilian charm and classical inspiration. The décor, paired with a menu of local delicacies and subtle Greek motifs, served as a poetic prelude to the main presentation.Tullio M. PugliaLisa Manobal, Jean-Christophe Babin, and Priyanka Chopra Jonas.Tullio M. PugliaViola Davis. After dinner, guests were ushered to the ancient Greek Theater of Taormina, where they were treated to a three-act performance showcasing the Polychroma collection. Models donned custom gowns by Francesco Murano, adorned with the high jewelry pieces, and the evening was masterfully choreographed by Sir Wayne McGregor, resident choreographer of The Royal Ballet, who seamlessly blended dance and performance art into a powerful visual narrative that brought the collection to life.For those wishing to explore the collection up close, Polychroma was on display at the San Domenico Palace in a thoughtfully curated showroom that fused art and high jewelry. Digital artist Zach Lieberman’s code-driven works were reimagined by renowned textile house Rubelli, suspended above milestone high jewelry pieces in a striking mosaic. Complementing the space, Taormina-based painter Alessandro Florio contributed handcrafted tapestries, adding a layer of local artistry to the immersive experience.Bulgari also introduced three innovative experiences that brought a modern edge to the display. Polychroma Theatre, created by artist Giuseppe Lo Schiavo, breathed digital life into a classical statue dating back to 1545–1546, merging past and future through immersive animation. Guests could step into Bulgari’s universe via Apple Vision Pro, experiencing the brand’s world in an entirely new dimension. Bulgari also unveiled Connected Jewelry—a discreet, invisible code etched into the metal of each piece, offering access to unique details and the story behind every creation.Tullio M. PugliaThe presentation in the Greek Theater of Taormina In honor of its new launch, Fondazione Bulgari also lent its support to two significant local initiatives: the restoration of a historic fresco at Palazzo Corvaja and a new partnership with the Antonio Salinas Regional Archaeological Museum in Palermo, further solidifying the brand’s commitment to preserving cultural heritage.For a closer look at the collection, scroll through the gallery below to see highlights from the showroom.",
