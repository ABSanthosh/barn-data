Collectively, Mr. Remick and his royal court of department heads are smitten with a navel-gazing nostalgia for Hollywood’s golden age.They end the days watching “Casino,” endeavor to greenlight anything other than reheated I.P. projects and kowtow to the many Hollywood aristocrats who appear on “The Studio” as exaggerated versions of themselves. (That the show airs on the very sort of streamer that helped upend the old Hollywood system adds its own layer of irony.)And if the Hollywood of today is an expanse of executives in gray sweaters and thousand-dollar dress sneakers, that memo was lost on its way to “The Studio.” In his turmeric-colored dress shirts and blazers with lapels jutting out above his shoulders, Matt is a throwback to a time when studio moguls dressed more like Italian industrialists. (A time that may not have even really existed.)ImageThe clothes in “The Studio” often make sly allusions to old movies. Here, Matt Remick (played by Seth Rogen) wears a suit not unlike an outfit from “The Player,” a 1992 Robert Altman film that appears to be an inspiration for “The Studio.”Credit...Apple TV+Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
