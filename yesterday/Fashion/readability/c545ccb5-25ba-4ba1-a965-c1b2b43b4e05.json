At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff. All of our market picks are independently selected and curated by the editorial team.

Shop Well-Received, our collection of editor-approved holiday gift guides, here and shop this gift guide on Pinterest here.But luxe doesn't have to mean expensive. In fact, many of the picks on this list are under $100. Instead of price, it's about opulent-feeling (read: cozy, plush, soft) fabrics, thoughtful gifts, personalized touches, elevated versions of wardrobe essentials that your giftee would never get for themselves, and, most importantly, pampering presents that will help them indulge in some self-care to start 2025 in a more relaxed state.AdvertisementADVERTISEMENTWith that in mind, ahead, find the best luxury gifts for the most deserving people on your list.At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff. All of our market picks are independently selected and curated by the editorial team. If you buy something we link to on our site, Refinery29 may earn commission.1 of 28Fashion Insider-Approved BagFashion editors have been waiting for the L.L.Bean x Tibi tote ever since the latter debuted the collaboration on its spring 2024 runway. The result is finally here and even better up close with a belt that adorns the Maine-based brand's signature style. Perfect for travel or errands, this tote will delight the most fashion-forward on your list.2 of 28PajamasI received these pajamas as a gift earlier this year and love how light and soft they are. Plus: They come in a bunch of different colorways and at a great price point.AdvertisementADVERTISEMENT3 of 28Jewelry BoxThis decadent heart-shaped jewelry box (which can double as a bag) is for the youngest luxe-loving giftee on your list — unless you want to borrow it, that is. If your recipient’s jewelry collection isn’t big enough yet to fill the box (or if you're looking for a gift under $50), look to Super Smalls' Disney collection which includes necklace and earring sets for the Frozen and Moana repeat viewers.4 of 28Leather Makeup BagA heart-shaped case for the grown-ups. Since launching last year, Cuyana's travel roll has become my go-to makeup bag for the way it keeps my beauty essentials organized. This case offers a more affordable — and adorable — alternative.5 of 28LED MaskAn LED mask — meant to address fine lines, wrinkles, and blemishes — is on my personal wishlist this season (hint, hint), and would make a perfect gift for the skin-care obsessed on your list.6 of 28Botanical SerumI’ve long been a fan of this magic potion botanical-infused serum for the way it nourishes and hydrates my skin during the harshest winter months, and will save up to buy it (or happily receive it as a gift) come cold-weather season. If your wallet allows, consider splurging on the Ultimate Set — in addition to the serum, it features a cleanser and an essence — which has visibly improved my parched skin and made it radiant after a few weeks of use alone.7 of 28Olive Oil SetFor the at-home cook, this set from premium olive oil brand Graza includes two bottles of Drizzle finishing oil, as well as two brightly hued half-circle serving trays and two dipping bowls made in collaboration with Areaware.AdvertisementADVERTISEMENT8 of 28Quality RobeColorful and cozy, this terry cloth robe comes courtesy of one of my favorite homewares brands Dusen Dusen (I’ve used their duvet set for the last few years), and is a perfect upgrade to your recipient’s years-old robe.9 of 28Carry-all ToteSurprise your most on-the-go friend with this luxe pick from New York-based designer brand LaPointe. Crafted in a gorgeous fuchsia colorway and featuring snake-embossed detailing, it’s far from your basic tote bag.10 of 28Hoop EarringsYou can never go wrong with a good-quality hoop earring. For proof, see this mixed-metal pair from Jennifer Fisher, a brand known for its hoop styles, named after stylist Nicole Chavez who counts Kristen Bell and Rachel Bilson as clients. Another favorite: Hailey Huggies, a go-to for, yes, Hailey Bieber.11 of 28Quality SocksFor those who like to receive socks in their stocking, this trendy burgundy pair is from the brand that makes some of the best. Comme Si also offers options in cashmere and wool, as well as gift box sets, if you’re looking to get even more fancy.12 of 28Signet RingNot only are signet rings trending but they also make for personalized gifts, with many options on the market available to engrave. This pinky ring from Ring Concierge can feature up to three characters and is studded with two diamonds.AdvertisementADVERTISEMENT14 of 28Cashmere SheetsThere is nothing more luxurious than the feeling of new sheets. These cozy cashmere ones would make a perfect winter gift for the homebody who treats their bed like their temple. 15 of 28Personalized Lip BalmWhile these lip balms have gone viral, and for a good reason — they are fun to personalize, they are great at hydrating the lips, and they make for a thoughtful gift — you don’t have to fly to Paris and wait in line to get your hands on one.16 of 28Luxe Body SetAnother gift I loved receiving this year was this body wash-and-lotion set, which features the same scent as my go-to perfume. It made my everyday shower routine feel like a spa treatment. I was genuinely sad when I used the shower gel to the last drop.17 of 28CandleDon’t have the financial means to take your jet-setting bestie to Greece? Transport them to Mykonos — or Ibiza, Marrakech, or Tulum — mentally via this candle. Tip: Keep the holder that makes for fun decor and a knickknack container when you're done burning the candle.AdvertisementADVERTISEMENT18 of 28SweaterNo artist has exploded more into the mainstream’s consciousness in 2024 than Chappell Roan. Mark the Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess era with a sweater from Lingua Franca, the brand known for its high-quality sweaters with witty sayings. For the ultimate luxe pick, consider using Lingua Franca's custom service, which can transform your photos or hand-drawn pictures into embroidered designs. Think: cashmere crewnecks featuring your pet, your children's drawings, or an outline of your childhood home.19 of 28Cocktail glassesFor your martini bestie, Sophie Lou Jacobsen makes some of the most aesthetically pleasing glassware.20 of 28Ssense Beauty BagWhile at $215, this beauty set isn't the cheapest option in this roundup, it is the ultimate pick for the luxury beauty lover. Featuring 26 products, it includes cult favorites like Augustinus Bader Eye Cream, Dr. Barbara Sturm Super Anti-Aging Serum, and La Mer Concentrate, as well as fragrances by Byredo, Frédéric Malle, and D.S. \u0026 Durga. What's more, it all comes housed in an adorable drawstring pouch designed by Simone Rocha.21 of 28Stocking Stuffer SunscreenFor a fun alternative to the usual stocking stuffer suspects (and to promote more regular sunscreen use), pick up this mini set of Supergoop’s best-selling sunscreens, which you can split up or gift as a trio. Alternatively, you can get the brand’s Glow Stick Sunscreen, which can fit in any stocking and purse and be used for on-the-go applications.22 of 28SneakersAfter being introduced to APL’s Zipline sneakers a few years ago, they are now the only shoe I work out in. Not only is the silhouette incredibly comfortable regardless of whether you’re running or doing a HIIT workout, but it also looks sleek thanks to the knit upper and comes in many different colors (which might explain why I frequently wear them out when I am not exercising, too).AdvertisementADVERTISEMENT23 of 28Boxer ShortsBoxer shorts will continue to trend next year, and these ones from Hommegirls are the fashion-insider favorite. For those who prefer more coverage or are committed to a capsule wardrobe life, this shirt from the brand is a favorite of Jenna Lyons.24 of 28Designer HeadphonesThe brand behind some of the best audio equipment, Bose, has collaborated with our favorite quirky beaded accessories designer, Susan Alexandra, for the cutest pair of headphones. Adorn the noise-canceling headphones, which come in lilac and blue colorways, using the included rhinestone stickers and a beaded butterfly charm to make the piece truly your own.25 of 28Stocking Stuffer MaskAnother great stocking stuffer idea, this Summer Fridays product (which also comes in a mini version) is a travel must-have for the way it quickly rehydrates the skin. Use it as a mask after a flight or leave it on as a moisturizer for a fresh-looking-looking complexion the next day.26 of 28Luxury ScarfIf you’re going to gift an oversized scarf this season, make it an ultra-luxe one, like this mohair-and-wool blend style from the designer brand Loewe's holiday collaboration with Japanese ceramicist studio Suna Fujita.27 of 28Coffee Table BookTake the cinephiles in your life into the luxurious, dreamy world of Sofia Coppola with this coffee table book that features the filmmaker’s collection of photographs, reference collages, and ephemera from beloved classics like The Virgin Suicides and Lost in Translation to the more recent favorites such as Beguiled and Priscilla.28 of 28Weighted Sleep MaskAnother pick for the jet setters or sleep lovers in your life, this weighted silk sleep mask, similarly to popular weighted blankets, is meant to enhance deeper sleep.AdvertisementADVERTISEMENT",
