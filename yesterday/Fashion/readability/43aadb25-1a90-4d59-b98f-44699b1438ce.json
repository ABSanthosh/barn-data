Only as an Accessory.The bags from the supermarket chain are becoming increasingly popular, even though the store doesn’t operate in Britain.The bags swung from many a shoulder on a recent sunny afternoon in East London.Credit...April Alexander for The New York TimesJuly 21, 2025Updated 10:57 a.m. ETBefore his trip to New York this year, Christos Paphiti, a lawyer based in London, considered two stops on his itinerary to be essential: the Whitney Museum of American Art and … Trader Joe’s.His visit to the grocery store was the culmination of months of longing. Mr. Paphiti, 29, had for about a year seen more and more people in Dalston, his trendy East London neighborhood, sporting Trader Joe’s tote bags. “Seeing people in their cute fits wearing them, I was like: ‘What is Trader Joe’s? Where can I get one?’” he said.Mr. Paphiti left New York with seven tote bags for himself and friends. “Everyone was super touched by it,” he said. “I was like, ‘Sweetie, it was $4.’”Though Trader Joe’s does not have a single location in Britain, the chain’s large cream and navy tote bags can be spotted all over London these days. Their popularity was clear on a recent sunny afternoon in East London, where the bag swung from many a shoulder. “I think I’ve seen more of the Trader Joe’s tote bags in London than I have where I live in San Francisco,” said Hannah Tyldsley, a 27-year-old who works in consulting and was in the city visiting friends.Some have expressed confusion at the bag’s seemingly sudden ubiquity in the city; others are questioning why a Londoner would want to sport merch from a midrange foreign supermarket chain. “It feels a little bit overdone,” said Annabel, a 24-year-old in London Fields who declined to give her last name, because of where she worked. “It’s such an American thing, which is weird because I feel like America is not cool at the moment.”ImageWhat does it mean to carry a Trader Joe’s tote around London?Credit...April Alexander for The New York TimesThe American-ness, however, is part of the allure: One surefire way to get the bag is to visit the United States, or to know someone who will. But you can also purchase the bag on a resale site, like Vinted, where hundreds of the totes are currently being sold for about 10 pounds ($11.50). Aysun Yeter, a 28-year-old recruitment consultant who said she bought her bag because “the American girlies have it,” sold an extra tote she had for £20 ($27) last year, almost seven times its retail price of $3.99.In London, as in many other metropolises, people use popular tote bags to project an image of themselves. Similar to the bag from The New Yorker, carrying a tote from Daunt Books, a chain of British independent bookshops, tells passersbys that you’re well read. While the tote from the French eyewear brand Jimmy Fairly signals that you have good taste (and, perhaps, poor eyesight). In such an environment, what, then, are London-based wearers of Trader Joe’s totes saying about themselves?“You’re a little bit well traveled,” said Jarrod Stevenson, 30, who bought his bag on a trip to Los Angeles last year. “Obviously, at some point, you’ve been to the States. You’ve picked up the bag. You know what’s up.”For the very online, it would be hard not to know “what’s up” with Trader Joe’s, no matter where you are located. Last year’s frenzy over the chain’s mini tote bags was hard to escape on TikTok. Its bags are popular among influencers in Japan. And in South Korea, so many people were bringing back its “everything but the bagel” seasoning that the authorities officially banned it. (The seasoning contains poppy seeds, which are considered contraband in the country.)ImageOwners of the bag praised its structure, size and sturdiness.Credit...April Alexander for The New York TimesTrader Joe’s, which is known for its reasonably priced own-brand groceries, has about 600 stores in the United States, with more to come this year. The chain opened its first store in Pasadena, Calif., in 1967, expanded outside the state to Phoenix in 1993 and finally arrived in New York City in 2006. Though the store, which has a German parent company, is yet to add a location overseas, tales of its popular items — like frozen butter chicken and chili-and-lime-flavored rolled corn tortilla chips — have spread. The company did not respond to requests for comment on this story.“There was a lot of Trader Joe’s content online that I think I must have been absorbing because when I went to New York I was feral and wanted to try everything,” said Emma Courtney, a 28-year-old surveyor who lives in East London. “I wanted to try the Trader Joe’s ready meals. I don’t even eat ready meals here.”As the Trader Joe’s tote becomes increasingly popular in London, some owners are beginning to feel self-conscious — it is now not uncommon for two wearers to pass each other on the street. However, for many, any feelings of unoriginality are smothered by a force more powerful: practicality.Not one conversation with a Trader Joe’s tote bag owner on that recent East London afternoon went by without praise for the bag’s structure, size and sturdiness. “I’m embarrassed sometimes to wear it now,” Ms. Courtney said of her bag. “But it’s so practical, I can’t bear to stop using it.”Desiree Ibekwe is a writer for The Morning newsletter, based in London.Related ContentAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT",
