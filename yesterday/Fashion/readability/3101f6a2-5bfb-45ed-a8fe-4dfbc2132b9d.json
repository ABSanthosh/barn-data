  "description": "Spring, and the trends that come with it, are the ultimate reset — golden-hour strolls, that first jacket-free afternoon, and the undeniable urge to swap neutrals for something brighter. But the yo-yo weather that comes with the season has me frozen trying to figure out how to dress, let alone what new pieces I should add to my rotation. Maybe it’s the fashion editor in me, but I’m also already deep in the throes of analyzing the freshly debuted fall 2025 collections, making pinpointing what feels new right now trickier than usual. Yet, somehow, Nordstrom’s Spring Sale always helps me refocus and zero in on the staples and playful pieces I know I don’t want to be without — all while avoiding the dreaded overspend (which, I’ll admit, I’m incredibly guilty of).So, what’s on my list? Minimalist flats — my go-to for stylish practicality. A light layering jacket, a.k.a. the holy grail of spring dressing. And, while I’ve always considered myself a \"dress girl,\" lately, I’ve been craving more mix-and-match separates, from the latest trending denim to unfussy tops and knits I can put my own spin on with fun bags, sleek jewelry, and bold sunnies. Of course, loungewear remains a staple — for working from home, running errands, and traveling. (Come to think of it, I do need a new swimsuit for my upcoming vacay in Aruba!)Click through for my seasonal picks, all available to shop for less right now (while stock lasts!). Nordstrom’s Spring Sale runs from March 12 to March 24, so get moving to scoop up to 50% off your favorite brands.All linked products are independently selected by our editors.
