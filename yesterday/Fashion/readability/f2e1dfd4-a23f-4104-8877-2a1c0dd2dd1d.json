Each year that we have undertaken the guide, I’ve been impressed with our readers’ generosity, and I hope you will consider donating again this holiday season.The columnist Nicholas Kristof kicks things off, suggesting several organizations around the globe that positively effect change. “If you’re feeling dispirited by national or global events,” he writes, “remember the adage that it is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness.” Nick has been Opinion’s guiding light when it comes to raising money for worthy causes, and this year his list offers many good options.One of my favorite parts of this tradition is offering you some of my own suggestions: I’d be remiss not to start with The New York Times Communities Fund. The campaign, started by the paper more than a century ago, this year supports nine organizations focused on feeding families, offering educational opportunities and much more. You will hear more about their work from me and our editorial board over the next several weeks, but please consider giving to the Communities Fund.Holiday Giving Guide 2024 Holiday Giving Guide 2024 A running series from Times Opinion writers on where they thinkyour charitable giving can help most this year. A running series from Times Opinion writers on where they think your charitable giving can help most this year. I’ve spent the weeks since the election thinking a lot about the future of education in the United States, as the president-elect and his allies have pledged to rethink the federal Department of Education and its mission. One model that I’ve been impressed with is the Cristo Rey Network. Its Catholic high schools across the country give students a curriculum that helps prepare them for college while also placing them at professional jobs once a week during the school year. Students, on average, come from families of four making $38,000 a year or less.What impresses me is that Cristo Rey’s approach offers students multiple pathways coming out of high school, giving them true choice combined with hands-on work experience. I’m most familiar with and have supported the Cristo Rey campus in Milwaukee, which has proved transformational to its community, but you’ll likely find one of the network’s 40 schools nearby if you are interested in supporting its efforts.There are few things that can bring joy like helping those in need. Wishing you all that satisfaction in abundance this year.This article is part of Times Opinion’s Giving Guide 2024. If you are interested in any organization mentioned in Times Opinion’s Giving Guide 2024, please go directly to its website. Neither the authors nor The Times will be able to address queries about the groups or facilitate donations.Kathleen Kingsbury is the Opinion editor of The New York Times, overseeing the editorial board and the Opinion section.
