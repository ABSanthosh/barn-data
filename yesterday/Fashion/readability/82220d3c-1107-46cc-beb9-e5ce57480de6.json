Credit...Lucas PossiedeFeb. 28, 2025ASAP Rocky is well aware that his life could be very different right now.“I feel so lucky to even be here talking to you,” Rocky said, speaking here late into the night on Thursday at a dinner celebrating his appointment as creative director for the Ray-Ban eyewear empire.After all, it was just last week that the rapper was found not guilty on charges of shooting a former collaborator, sparing him up to 24 years in jail.“I feel blessed, I feel lucky and fortunate,” Rocky said.And so, just after 10 p.m., and only a couple hours after landing in Italy, Rocky arrived at Trattoria del Ciumbia in an understandably triumphant mood.“I’m so happy to see y’all faces, this is crazy,” he called out to a room peppered with fashion designers, models and sundry celebrities like Romeo Beckham and Charli D’Amelio. For the remainder of the hour, Rocky worked the room like Frank Sinatra at the Copacabana.He shook hands and posed for endless photos with his eyes hidden behind blacked-out sunglasses. He autographed a box of his special-edition Ray-Bans printed with a reworked image of a $100 bill, with his face where Benjamin Franklin’s would normally appear. He poured shots of tequila for the table. If there were any lingering concerns about how the fashion world would receive post-trial Rocky, they were brushed away by hugs, clinked glasses and general good feelings pinging around the room.Clockwise from top left: Ice Spice, ASAP Rocky and Romeo Beckham, Charli D'Amelio, Amina Seck and Alioune Badara Fall.Credit...Photographs by Lucas PossiedeThank you for your patience while we verify access.
