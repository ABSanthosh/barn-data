If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.You know that sinking feeling when you smell an amazing scent in a store only to be shocked by the price tag? Dossier has changed the fragrance game, making some of the world’s best-selling designer scents accessible to all budgets. This Dossier perfume review covers everything you need to know about the brand, including their offerings, why they’re worth considering, and potential drawbacks to be aware of. Best known for their “Impression” line, Dossier recreates luxury fragrances at their perfumery in France and then sells them for a fraction of the price of the originals. This innovative approach allows anyone interested in the olfactory world to test famous scents without draining their bank account. The brand also has a collection of its own scents and an intuitive website that makes it easy to find exactly what you’re on the hunt for. In This ArticleHow We TestedAbout Dossier PerfumeBuying ConsiderationWhy It's GreatHow To Wear ItFlaws But Not DealbreakersWhy Trust UsVerdictFAQs dossierperfumes / Instagram How We Tested There are a lot of incredible fragrance brands on the market, providing budget-friendly alternatives to some of the top designer scents. But it can be hard to know which brands are worth the spend and which you can bypass altogether. To simplify matters, I’ve done the legwork of testing out Dossier’s perfume range and comparing it to other available options. Throughout my testing, I wanted to see how Dossier measured up against high-end scents and how the brand compared to other affordable alternatives. Rather than my throwing you out into the open water to discover perfumes alone, consider me your steady captain, ready to guide you through the expansive fragrance seas. Measurements I lean towards cool, fresh scents that can be worn throughout the year. My go-to is Wood Sage and Sea Salt by Jo Malone, but because it’s a couple of hundred bucks per bottle, I’ve been hankering for a more affordable everyday scent. I really like clean, aquatic notes, as well as citrus colognes with herbal and green qualities that don’t weigh you down. This is what I was primarily looking for when researching for this Dossier perfume review. TL;DR dossierperfumes / Instagram Dossier is the premier destination for designer inspired scents at an affordable price point. The brand has dozens of substitutes for popular perfumes at a fraction of the original cost. Customers have mixed feelings about Dossier, with drawbacks including flaky customer support and some longevity issues. The bottom line is that Dossier is a compelling option if you’re searching for high-end scents on a tighter budget. About Dossier Perfume dossierperfumes / Instagram Made in Grasse, France, better known as the “world’s perfume capital,” Dossier is surrounded by the fragrance industry’s best. The brand leans into responsible, cruelty-free, non-toxic scents made with sustainable ingredients and eco-friendly materials. But what really makes the brand special is how close their scents are to the designer originals. You can use the search function on the Dossier website to look for your favorite brands and colognes. Then, Dossier will find you the closest match from their collection, at a price that’s up to 70% lower than the designer cost. The brand offers daily flash sales and even a Dossier+ membership that grants you monthly store credit and access to extra perks. Now that you have the lowdown on the brand, let’s dig a bit deeper below the surface. chofulloflove / Instagram What to Consider Before Buying Looking for a Specific Scent? The main consideration when exploring Dossier scents is whether you’re looking for a specific fragrance substitute. If so, you can search for the exact fragrance on Dossier’s website and it will return the brand’s rendition. For example, if you search for Le Labo’s Santal 33, Dossier will showcase their Woody Sandalwood cologne, inspired by the luxury scent. Some of Dossier’s best-selling alternatives include: Aromatic Star Anise —\u003e Dior Sauvage Ambery Vanilla —\u003e YSL Black Opium Woody Sage —\u003e Jo Malone Wood Sage and Sea Salt Musky Oakmoss —\u003e Creed Aventus Citrus Ginger —\u003e Bleu de Chanel Powdery Tobacco —\u003e Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille This is only scratching the surface of Dossier’s collection, and as you can see, the brand leans into some of the best-selling colognes in the world. Rather than dropping $100+ on a single bottle, Dossier makes the scents accessible with fair pricing and shockingly close matches to the originals. Impression vs. Original Collection Dossier’s two main collections include the Impression and Originals. The Impression perfumes are those which are developed based on another scent. These are the main draw to the brand as Dossier replicates some of the top designer fragrances and sells them for a fraction of the price. Additionally, Dossier has its Original collection, with scents unique to the brand. The Originals are segmented with smaller collections covering seasons, unisex scents, weddings, speakeasies, evening wear, and wellness. These divisions make it easy to sort through Dossier’s original offerings to find exactly what you’re looking for. Although the Impressions are what bring most people through Dossier’s doors, the Original collection has some decent offerings like Sage \u0026 Black Tea Renew and Rose \u0026 Basil Bliss. They’re not world-class fragrances by any means, but they get the job done without breaking the bank. Sort by Note Something to consider when shopping for Dossier perfumes is that you can also sort by note or fragrance profile. This allows you to lean into the bouquets you know and love without browsing the entire website. You can filter Dossier perfumes by the following categories: Vanilla cologne Jasmine Rose Gardenia Amber Lavender Oud colognes Sandalwood Coconut Musk Sweet-smelling colognes Patchouli The only aspect worth noting is that it can be unclear how to find these categories, as they don’t exist on the menu. In my experience, they can be located at the bottom of the main category pages, such as Dossier Impressions and Dossier Originals. Why I Like Dossier Perfume If you’re searching for truly convincing alternatives to designer fragrances or classic colognes on a budget, then Dossier is the ultimate destination. I’ve found that these colognes live up to the hype and provide an affordable way to smell like a million bucks. We’re talking alternatives to Dior, Creed, Jo Malone, Chanel, Diptyque, and beyond. The line of colognes and perfumes is highly versatile, making it simple to find exactly what you’re looking for, whether it’s a bright daytime scent or a sexy, warm fragrance for chilly evenings. No matter what you choose, Dossier perfumes exude an air of opulence. But, rather than having you save for months and then drop a solid chunk of change on a new cologne, Dossier opens the olfactory world to a whole new side of affordable alternatives strikingly similar to their inspiration. This is why I adore the brand. Although it may be easy to blow off Dossier as another Amazon perfume giant, the company uses premium ingredients, backed by French fragrance practices and thousands of customer reviews who state that they’re the real deal. Aside from the compelling fragrance revamps (which sometimes even smell better than the originals), Dossier leans into many innovative features that set it apart from other brands. Some aspects that I really enjoy from Dossier include: Various fragrance collections make it easy to sort by seasonality, gender, notes, and events. The brand makes it easy and intuitive to find what you’re looking for. Dossier has an AI Fragrance Concierge that you can chat with to be paired with the perfect fragrance for you. Overall, I find genuinely good budget-friendly fragrances few and far between. Dossier has changed the game and is rapidly turning the perfume industry on its head. Affordable, accessible, and very close alternatives to some of the top colognes in the world, Dossier is well worth it. How to Wear Dossier Perfume xo_sarasilvestri / Instagram Dossier’s fragrance line is long-lasting, lingering for hours after the initial spritz. For example, Dossier’s rendition of Le Labo’s Santal 33 is known to last all day, similar to the original. Most of the colognes feature an elegant dry down and are either an Eau de Toilette or an Eau de Parfum, depending on your specific choice. To wear Dossier’s Eau de Toilettes, spray liberally on pulse points and consider reapplying throughout the day. Eau de Parfums from Dossier will have greater lasting power and need less reapplication. Although some of Dossier’s perfumes are seasonal, you’ll also find that the majority work for year-round wear. The brand makes it easy to wear its offerings and hunt down the exact scent you’re searching for, either by the original designer, key notes, or the time to wear it. Overall, through my review of Dossier perfume, I’ve found that the brand has created easy-wearing, high-quality colognes for those on a limited budget. ellachar_g / Instagram Flaws But Not Deal-breakers I have personally had an overwhelmingly positive experience with the brand, as shown through this Dossier perfume review. However, I know that Dossier is not without a touch of controversy. There’s plenty of talk about Dossier scams, the inability to return products or claim refunds, and some other dodgy business, which I heard about after I received my order. I dug deep into the depths of Reddit to explore the flaws of Dossier perfume, which are laid out below: The biggest flaw of some Dossier perfumes is that they can have a powdery smell. This cropped up over and over again in customer reviews for various fragrances. The powdery notes tend to come out in the dry down a little while after the initial spritz. Some reviewers spoke about quality issues, stating that the fragrances have no lasting power and are a far cry from the originals. I’ve found that this depends on the Impression you’ve chosen, as some of Dossier’s renditions align more closely with the originals than others. Finally, and most consistently, Dossier is known to have exceptionally poor customer service. It’s next to impossible to get a response from a member of the team, and returns and refunds are a drawn-out headache. Some reviewers state that it took up to six months to get money back for a returned product. My opinion on the matter is that we’re talking about $40 bottles of perfume here. Some are going to smash it out of the park, and some are going to strike out. But just because there are a couple of foul balls doesn’t mean you have to discredit the whole team. Overall, Dossier is still an incredible choice for affordable alternatives to famous fragrances. How to Care for Dossier Perfume To make the most of your Dossier perfume, store it in a cool, dry area away from direct sunlight. Think inside a medicine cabinet, the top drawer, or your dresser. It also helps to keep your cologne out of the bathroom because added humidity can affect the strength of a fragrance by leading the essential oils to break down for a duller, less concentrated scent. fragancerd.do / Instagram Why Trust Us Jane is a perfume fanatic and after a decade of shelling out thousands of dollars on luxury scents, she knew that it was time for an alternative. And so, this Dossier perfume review was born, along with Jane’s obsession with finding affordable colognes for men on a budget. She’s written dozens of articles about the best colognes for men, sticking to her designer preferences but also branching out with scents that are accessible to almost anyone. When she’s not tracking down the latest colognes, Jane can be found sitting on a terrace in Paris reading a book with a coffee (and wearing her signature Jo Malone perfume). Verdict Anyone seeking a designer scent on a budget will benefit from this Dossier perfume review. The brand has pulled out all the stops to create convincing alternatives to some of the top scents in the world, minus the sky-high price tags. Consider Dossier if you’re searching for a budget-friendly substitute for an expensive cologne or are looking for an affordable way to test out some of the best fragrances from high-end designers (revamped by Dossier). FAQ Dossier is worth it for low-priced fragrances inspired by designer colognes and perfumes. Dossier’s versions are usually shockingly close to the originals, making the brand a compelling option for any CognoScenti on a tight budget. Dossier perfume is normally long lasting cologne, lingering from the first spritz in the morning until late afternoon or early evening. The brand has a mix of Eau de Toilettes and Eau de Parfums. Dossier’s Eau de Parfums last longer than the brand’s Eau de Toilettes, as the former includes a higher concentration of fragrance oils. Dossier is a wonderful choice for nontoxic, cruelty-free fragrances that are designed to be safe for the skin. The brand also leans into sustainable packaging, with a commitment to an eco-conscious business.

No matter what you choose, Dossier perfumes exude an air of opulence.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut, rather than having you save for months and then drop a solid chunk of change on a new cologne, Dossier opens the olfactory world to a whole new side of affordable alternatives strikingly similar to their inspiration. This is why I adore the brand.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAlthough it may be easy to blow off Dossier as another Amazon perfume giant, the company uses premium ingredients, backed by French fragrance practices and thousands of customer reviews who state that they’re the real deal.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAside from the compelling fragrance revamps (which sometimes even smell better than the originals), Dossier leans into many innovative features that set it apart from other brands.

However, I know that Dossier is not without a touch of controversy.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere’s plenty of talk about Dossier scams, the inability to return products or claim refunds, and some other dodgy business, which I heard about after I received my order. I dug deep into the depths of Reddit to explore the flaws of Dossier perfume, which are laid out below:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe biggest flaw of some Dossier perfumes is that they can have a powdery smell. This cropped up over and over again in customer reviews for various fragrances. The powdery notes tend to come out in the dry down a little while after the initial spritz.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSome reviewers spoke about quality issues, stating that the fragrances have no lasting power and are a far cry from the originals. I’ve found that this depends on the Impression you’ve chosen, as some of Dossier’s renditions align more closely with the originals than others.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFinally, and most consistently, Dossier is known to have exceptionally poor customer service. It’s next to impossible to get a response from a member of the team, and returns and refunds are a drawn-out headache. Some reviewers state that it took up to six months to get money back for a returned product.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMy opinion on the matter is that we’re talking about $40 bottles of perfume here. Some are going to smash it out of the park, and some are going to strike out. But just because there are a couple of foul balls doesn’t mean you have to discredit the whole team. Overall, Dossier is still an incredible choice for affordable alternatives to famous fragrances.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to Care for Dossier Perfume\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo make the most of your Dossier perfume, store it in a cool, dry area away from direct sunlight. Think inside a medicine cabinet, the top drawer, or your dresser.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt also helps to keep your cologne out of the bathroom because added humidity can affect the strength of a fragrance by leading the essential oils to break down for a duller, less concentrated scent.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1180127\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1180127\" nitro-exclude=\"\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"a bottle of Dossier Woody Sandalwood perfume\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" nitro-exclude=\"\" nitro-lazy-src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fragancerd.do_abottleofDossierWoodySandalwoodperfume.jpg\" nitro-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fragancerd.do_abottleofDossierWoodySandalwoodperfume.jpg 800w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fragancerd.do_abottleofDossierWoodySandalwoodperfume-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fragancerd.do_abottleofDossierWoodySandalwoodperfume-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fragancerd.do_abottleofDossierWoodySandalwoodperfume-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fragancerd.do_abottleofDossierWoodySandalwoodperfume-450x450.jpg 450w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fragancerd.do_abottleofDossierWoodySandalwoodperfume-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fragancerd.do_abottleofDossierWoodySandalwoodperfume-696x696.jpg 696w\" decoding=\"async\" nitro-lazy-empty=\"\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fragancerd.do_abottleofDossierWoodySandalwoodperfume.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fragancerd.do_abottleofDossierWoodySandalwoodperfume.jpg 800w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fragancerd.do_abottleofDossierWoodySandalwoodperfume-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fragancerd.do_abottleofDossierWoodySandalwoodperfume-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fragancerd.do_abottleofDossierWoodySandalwoodperfume-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fragancerd.do_abottleofDossierWoodySandalwoodperfume-450x450.jpg 450w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fragancerd.do_abottleofDossierWoodySandalwoodperfume-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fragancerd.do_abottleofDossierWoodySandalwoodperfume-696x696.jpg 696w\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1180127\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C-QeaYZO8Sv/?img_index=6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003efragancerd.do\u003c/a\u003e / Instagram\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e \u003ch2 id=\"trust-us\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Trust Us\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e \u003cp\u003eJane is a perfume fanatic and after a decade of shelling out thousands of dollars on luxury scents, she knew that it was time for an alternative.
