  "description": "I've got a wedding-heavy summer ahead, so much so that I now consider myself an expert bridesmaid. However, as many of us know, bridesmaid duties come with hefty costs. While I'd do almost anything for my friends, going into debt isn't one of them. That's why I've been savvy about cutting costs, especially when it comes to my wedding shoes. I'm wearing the same pair to all three weddings on my calendar, namely the Dream Pairs Open Toe Pump Chunky Heel Sandals ($29, originally $36). I virtually stumbled upon them while working on a story about the best summer shoes on Amazon, and I was immediately intrigued since they hold the number one spot among all women's heeled sandals. Given their popularity, and the fact that the brand Dream Pairs happens to also make some of the most comfortable Western boots I've ever owned (these ones!), I decided they'd be a safe bet for my weddings. I scooped them up in my usual size 9.5 in a light beige color I knew would match all of my bridesmaid dresses - and that was one of the smartest decisions I've made this summer. Ahead, I break down everything you need to know about them if you're considering buying them for a special event, too. What I Like About the Dream Pairs Open Toe Pump Chunky Heel Sandals At the time of writing, I've already worn the Dream Pairs Open Toe Pump Chunky Heel Sandals to two of my three summer weddings. I'll admit, when everyone was showing off their designer shoes before the ceremony at the first wedding, I stayed quiet since I spent practically nothing on mine. But then I couldn't help but smile when I was the only bridesmaid who kept my shoes on for the entire reception. They were comfortable enough and stable. Even though the unhemmed dress I wore gave me some trouble walking down the aisle (totally my fault), my shoes kept me upright. Their chunky, stable block heel held up perfectly, even on the wet grass from a rainstorm earlier that day. Beyond their comfort, they looked the part, too, which I'd like to think is evidenced in this mirror selfie I snapped at the second wedding while the bride lounged behind me. (I'm wearing the Azazie Barbie Pleated Chiffon A-Line Dress in Champagne, BTW, and felt like a princess.) I chose the light beige color (one of 58 total styles and colors to choose from) because I knew they'd go with everything. Plus, I figured that if they survived all three weddings, the versatile shade would make them perfect for future special events. Despite wearing them through two ceremonies, two receptions, and hours of questionable moves on the dance floor, they're still in pristine shape for my final summer wedding in a few weeks. What's Worth Noting About the Dream Pairs Open Toe Pump Chunky Heel Sandals These sandals are not the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn, which, to be honest, I kind of expected given their price tag. The buckle at the ankle dug into my skin a bit at the first wedding, but in retrospect, I'm confident that was a user error from securing them as tight as possible to prevent a walk-down-the-aisle stumble. I was still able to wear them all night, which is more than I can say for some of the pricier heels I own. At the second wedding I didn't secure the strap as tightly and found they were comfortable from the time I slipped them on at 3 p.m. until 11:30 p.m. post-ceremony. No blisters, no blood, no regret. Another thing worth noting is that shoppers seem a bit conflicted over the fit. I hover between sizes 9.5 and 10, and since multiple shoppers noted that they run big, I went for the 9.5 and found they were a perfect fit. Many reviewers suggest ordering a half size down, which made sense for me, but a handful of others found that sizing down made them too small. So, if you're ordering them on Amazon without much time to spare, it might be worth ordering two sizes to find your ideal fit and returning the pair that doesn't work. Who Are the Dream Pairs Open Toe Pump Chunky Heel Sandals Best For? The Dream Pairs Open Toe Pump Chunky Heel Sandals are perfect for those looking for a reasonably priced, comfortable, and versatile pair of heels for a special event. While they might not be the most comfortable shoes in the world, they're the number one bestseller on Amazon in women's heeled sandals for plenty of other reasons. They've checked a big box off my summer wedding wardrobe checklist and will suit you well for any event where you need a timeless heel. Where Are the Dream Pairs Open Toe Pump Chunky Heel Sandals Available to Shop? I purchased the Dream Pairs Open Toe Pump Chunky Heel Sandals on Amazon, where they are marked dowon for the Big Spring Sale. They're also available on the brand's website. Additional Details The Dream Pairs Open Toe Pump Chunky Heel Sandals come in a total of 58 colors and styles. They have a three-inch block heel. They're available for fast shipping with Amazon Prime.
