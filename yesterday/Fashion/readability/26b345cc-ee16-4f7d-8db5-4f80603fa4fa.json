That means it’s time to plan your music festival outfits. Each festival has its own flare when it comes to the genres and musical acts, the venues, and, of course, the crowd’s fashion.So if you want to dress on theme for this spring and summer’s hottest music marathons, we curated mini style guides for each kind of vibe. Whether you’re in search of a fringe jacket for a desert festival, durable boots for a camping festival, an all-denim fit for a big city festival, or a breezy dress for a seaside festival, we’ve got you covered with all the essentials you could need and want.And just as music taste has no boundaries, neither should your fashion sense. So mix and match from the different guides below to concoct the perfect outfits for all your hip-hop, EDM, and country concerts. (And if you don’t happen to have any festivals lined up this summer, don’t sweat it. Because if you’re going to Beyonce’s Cowboy Carter tour or Bad Bunny’s Puerto Rico residency, there are plenty of styles below to take inspo from for these musical events, too.)Scroll on to learn more about the clothing, shoes, and accessories (including styles from some of our favorite brands’ festival collections) that should be included in your concert outfit lineup. DashDividers_1_500x100 Desert Music Festival Outfits Whether you’ve secured a coveted ticket to Coachella (April 11-20) or Stagecoach (April 25-27) in Indio, California (or have another desert festival on the horizon), you need outfits to withstand the sunny days and chilly nights ahead. These festivals (and their scenery) are synonymous with effortless, breezy, boho style, so incorporate fringe, wide-brim hats, and cowboy boots. Then at night, layer up with linen button-downs or light cardis (that can easily fit into your crossbody bag throughout the day). DashDividers_1_500x100 Grass \u0026 Camping Music Festival Outfits Planning on camping stateside at Bonnaroo (June 12-16) or Outside Lands (August 8-10), or traveling for Glastonbury (June 25-29) or Tomorrowland (July 18-27)? You’ll want to be strategic about your festival outfits, picking versatile, comfortable styles that can trek from stage to stage and last from day to night. For these grass-field festivals, consider supplementing your indie sleaze ‘fits with durable boots or utilitarian sneakers (that can handle muddy terrain). DashDividers_1_500x100 City Music Festival Outfits In big cities, you can get away with any kind of aesthetic. For East Coast spring festivals like Boston Calling (May 23-25) and New York’s Governor’s Ball (June 6-8), the weather shouldn’t be too warm yet, so consider a denim-on-denim outfit or jean dress. Meanwhile, for Midwestern events like Summerfest (June 19-July 5) and Lollapalooza (July 31-August 3), the heat will be in full force, so opt for shorts and light fabrics. Then for Essence Festival (July 3-6) in New Orleans, which takes place both indoors and outside, keep it casual and cute with skorts and statement sneakers. DashDividers_1_500x100 Beach \u0026 Boardwalk Music Festival Outfits Whether your toes are literally in the sand at Sand In My Boots (May 16-18), you’re overlooking the Balearic Sea at Primavera Sound (June 4-8), or you’re enjoying a boardwalk breeze at Sea.Hear.Now (September 13-14), keep it effortless and cool in styles you’ll want to rewear all summer long. Vibe out to your favorite music seaside in a comfortable outfit like a crochet matching set or a sea-through maxi dress (worn over a bathing suit). Don’t forget a baseball cap or sunhat for extra protection. And for shoes, consider a pair of waterproof chunky sandals that won’t fly off mid-dance session. Like what you see?
