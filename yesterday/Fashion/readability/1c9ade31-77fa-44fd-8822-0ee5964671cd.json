What could be more fitting than a wedding on Halloween?Brandon Hupp, left, and Lyle Shearer.Credit...Tori OsteraaNov. 8, 2024Brandon Taylor Hupp has long been drawn to the spooky and macabre. Tim Burton has always been an artistic inspiration, and he considers the dark and moody to be romantic. When he met Lyle Andrew Shearer, who shared his predilections, they knew they might be a match.And so it was on Halloween that the couple eloped in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest near Snoqualmie Pass, Wash., with foggy mountains as the backdrop and lanterns and gothic umbrellas set up for décor.They chose Halloween for its origins: For Celtic pagans, Halloween was the eve of Samhain, a day they believed the dead could communicate with the living.Mr. Shearer’s brother and best friend both died in 2007, and Mr. Shearer has often expressed to Mr. Hupp that he wishes they were alive to meet him. The couple felt that if they got married on Halloween, then perhaps the loved ones they had lost might be with them in spirit.“In addition, if one of us ever died, maybe being married on Halloween would allow whomever went first the opportunity to come back and visit on our wedding night,” Mr. Hupp said. “A bit morbid, but something we find romantic.”The couple first met in June 2018 at Tracks, a nightclub in Denver, where they both lived at the time, the day before the city’s Pride parade.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
