  "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find our editor-approved lineup of the best to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now. When it comes to fashion and beauty, the end of May was defined by one thing and one thing only: The Cannes Film Festival. After a so-called “decency” rule that cracked down on nudity and long trains on the famed red carpet, some could assume that the looks would be more reserved and restrained. But thankfully, our favorite stars still brought the heat to the South of France, including Charli XCX wearing a lilac feathered YSL silk slip and Dakota Johnson partying in a sheer crystal-embellished Gucci gown. Even in the rain, Rihanna made the case for aquamarine being the color of the season, attending the Highest 2 Lowest premiere in a blue knotted Alaïa dress — complete with an umbrella. When it came to beauty, Julia Garner turned heads in a dark vampy lip and slick bleached hair, while Gabriette kept it all about the eyes with heavy black liner and a nude lip. But it was Bella Hadid that really got everybody talking — likely making tobacco blonde the salon request of the summer. As we look ahead to June, we’re turning our attention away from the red carpet and towards the store shelves, with a never-ending selection of beauty and fashion launches coming our way this month.To discover all our favorite products and collections dropping this June, click through the slideshow ahead.Levi’s x Sacai collection Levi’s might be an all-American classic, but it’s bringing something fresh to the table this summer thanks to a collaboration with Japanese luxury fashion brand Sacai. Known for its experimental, patchwork takes on formal wear, Sacai is now bringing its love of fusion to Levi’s denim, with a blazer-denim jacket hybrid and belted dark-wash jeans. However, it’s the full-length flared denim jumpsuit that has really caught our eye, modeled by Chase Sui Wonders in the latest campaign. Available to shop now at Levi’sEmbargo: Mango x Supriya LeleThose searching for their new resort wardrobe can stop right now. British Indian designer Supriya Lele has teamed up with Mango to create a hot-weather-ready collection, dubbed \"A Summer Reverie.\" Featuring 34 pieces, the selection includes a glittering gold two-piece, a sheer black maxi dress and an ’80s-inspired metallic blue swimsuit. But our favorite of the collection has to be the crochet-knit mini with feathered trim, based on one of Lele’s existing designs. The collection stands as the first Mango Collective drop, a platformaiming to celebrate niche designers.Available to shop June 5th at MangoConverse x Isabel Marant Converse and Isabel Marant are reuniting to bring back the wedge sneaker. The footwear brand's latest collab with the Parisian label reimagines two beloved Converse styles — the Chuck 70 (in both high- and low-top silhouettes) and Chuck Wedge — with artful bandana-scarf prints borrowed from the latter's spring/summer 2025 collection. “Good design will always be noticeable, and you’ll never get bored of something that is well achieved — much like the Chuck,\" Marant said in a press release. \"This collection speaks to a cool, easy, and playful attitude.\"  Find the new sneakers in brown and red colorways. Shop on June 3 at Isabel Marant and June 5 at Converse.Glossier Lip GlazeLip oils have become all the rage in the last few years. From Dior’s Lip Glow Oil to NYX’s Fat Oil Lip Drip, the glazed look isn’t going anywhere. Just in time for summer, the new Glossier Lip Glaze touts itself as the “next generation” of lip oil, with a melt-on-the-mouth sheer finish and cooling menthol effect. Infused with ingredients like liquid shea butter and jojoba oil, the lip gloss replacement promises to leave lips feeling hydrated and nourished. Available in six different tints (including a frosty lilac and rich russet red), it’s the non-sticky summer formula we’re ready for.Available to shop now at GlossierGlossier Lip Glaze, $, available at GlossierKylie Cosmetics Hybrid BlushCream blush has been on trend, but some find the staying power lacking.

JVN is launching its first formula, promising a product without residue, buildup or a white cast, while still providing oil reduction, volume and lift. With ingredients like micellar for cleansing, rosemary for scalp circulation and hemisqualane for hair health, the product is formulated to be kind to strands in between wash days. Plus, the fragrance combines warming amber, violet leaf and crisp apple, making it a treat for those around you, too.Available to shop on June 10th at JVN Converse 1908 Collection, Curated by Tyler, The CreatorTeaming up with long-time collaborator Tyler, The Creator, Converse is bringing the nostalgia this summer with a new vintage-inspired collection.
