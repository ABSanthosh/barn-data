  "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find our editor-approved lineup of the best to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now. Both awards season and Fashion Month are drawing to an end, which means leaving red carpet glam, eye-catching street style, and show-stopping runway looks in the rearview mirror. But, as the old cliché goes, when one door closes, another must open — and that’s certainly true in the world of fashion and beauty. As spring weather approaches, nudging us out of our winter cocoons, a new crop of trends, buzzy campaigns, and launches are also emerging in the sunlight. Sabrina Carpenter is helping debut new Prada Beauty products, Refinery29-favorite brand Aligne is making its foray into bridal, and Glow Recipe is furthering its stronghold on the skincare-meets-makeup category with its latest cheek tints — and that’s just the start. Keep scrolling to discover more of the new fashion and beauty launches we’re excited about this month.All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.Aligne Introduces Bridal Capsule Collection The British brand known for its collarless blazers is set to walk down the aisle with the launch of its debut bridal capsule collection. Designed to be versatile, bold, and tradition-skewing, the line is made up of four pieces that can be worn during or beyond wedding celebrations: a satin mini dress with bows on the shoulders, a peplum top with ribbon detailing, a satin mini dress with puff sleeves, and, of course, a tailored satin blazer that ties at the front. Prices start at $165. Shop now at Aligne Aligne Ivy Puff Sleeve Satin Mini Dress, $, available at AligneStarface Launches Skincare Starface changed the game when it launched its fun, irreverent, and effective star-shaped pimple patches.

The Australian designer’s eponymous brand has just dropped its first-ever collection of denim, and it includes 15 pieces for a range of occasions — think high-waisted straight-leg jeans, cinched dresses, oversized jackets with cocoon sleeves, and a denim blazer. “Denim has always been a staple in everyday wardrobes, and I wanted to create pieces that can be seamlessly integrated into our customers’ existing collections while still offering the signature sophistication and elevated style that they expect from the brand,” Vallance said in a press release.

Enter: Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Dewy Flush. The tinted cheek serum combines the rosiness of a soft blush with skin-boosting ingredients, like brightening and smoothing niacinamide and calming centella asiatica to hydrate skin, refine the appearance of pores, and impart a natural flush. Available in two shades — peachy Watermelon Flush and warmer Berry Flush — the formula is also buildable, so you can opt for a dewy and sheer look or a more pigmented finish. Shop now at Glow RecipeGlow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Dewy Flush, $, available at Glow RecipeZara x Style Not Com When Beka Gvishiani, founder of the mega-popular fashion Instagram account Style Not Com, was approached by Zara, he started the conversation by saying: “Let’s talk about fashion.” That phrase is now at the heart of the resulting Zara x Style Not Com collection, which takes the account’s signature cobalt blue hue and bold white text and splashes them across a variety of apparel. Get meta with pieces like a baseball cap with the text “No, I’m not selling my hat,” a reference to Gvishiani’s signature hat; a hoodie emblazoned with “This is a hoodie without an idea;” or a T-shirt that says, “Life is a fashion week with some normal days in between.” Prices range from $10.90 to $69.90. Shop now at Zara Zara x Style Not Com T-Shirt, $, available at ZaraK18 AstroLift Reparative Volume Spray Fed up with using multiple products in your hair care routine?

It seems like the team at the popular jewelry brand Jenny Bird agrees — they spent the last month dropping new hoop earring styles.
