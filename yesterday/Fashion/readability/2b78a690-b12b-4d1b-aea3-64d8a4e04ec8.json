I’ve been wearing my boots for years, but it wasn’t until I discovered the best insoles for Blundstones that I unlocked their full potential. Blundstones are well known for being the “wear anywhere, do anything” shoes. They’re incredibly versatile, wildly durable, and very, very comfortable, especially when paired with the proper inserts. Adding insoles to Blundstones boosts their luxury tenfold. They go from being basic boots to shoes that you can conquer the world in. Whether you need insoles for standing all day, running around at work, or scaling the side of a mountain, supportive inserts will help you get there and beyond. However, with the endless options available, it can be hard to determine the best insoles for Blundstones, especially when considering the tight fit of the boots. To help steer you in the right direction, I’ve rounded up five of the best replacement insoles for Blundstones that offer support, cushioning, and a bit of warmth, depending on your needs. Keep reading to discover all you need to know about Blundstone boot inserts. Key Takeaways To determine the very best insoles for Blundstones, I reviewed hundreds of options, tested out a handful, and read thousands of user reviews to land on the five that made this list. Overall, the best are the brand’s Xtreme Comfort Footbed, which is a prime replacement for your boot’s original inserts. They mitigate impact and add extra cushioning, which is most welcome if you spend a lot of time on your feet. For a more budget-friendly alternative, the Happystep Memory Foam Arch Support Insoles are a standout choice for under ten bucks that will soften each step while providing lift in the center of the foot. In This Article Our PicksBuying ConsiderationsHow We ChoseWhy Trust Us? Final VerdictFAQs shoeflyalaska / Instagram Best Overall: Blundstone Xtreme Comfort Footbed Why they’re great: As a best-selling option from the brand itself, these are the best insoles for Blundstones for an extra hit of support. They’re designed to help cut down on foot, knee, and back pain through targeted shock absorption and a touch of extra cushioning. Aside from being designed for Blundstones (aka the only type of shoe every man needs), they’re an ideal addition to any pair of boots because of the low-profile design that won’t add extra bulk to already cramped shoes. Who are these for? Anyone covering serious ground can benefit from a pair of these Blundstone inserts. They’re specifically designed to support activity, so whether you’re walking, trekking, or simply standing all day, these will make a world of difference in the comfort department. But if you want to inject support rather than comfort into your boots, then consider Blundstone’s Comfort Arch Footbed as an alternative. Flaws but not deal-breakers: These are the best replacement insoles for Blundstones, but they tend to wear out quickly. Sizes: US 3–15  | Color: Black | Benefit: Comfort, shock absorption | Compatible with Blundstones? Yes Best Budget: Happystep Memory Foam Arch Support Insoles Why they’re great: These inserts are pretty much as basic as they come, ideal for budget shoppers and anyone who needs a slight boost in their boots rather than an entire overhaul. Featuring a high-density memory foam construction, these are very close to the original Blundstone insoles but with a tiny bit of extra structured arch support. They help add a cushion to the boots and further shock absorption, making these epic companions for your wear-anywhere shoes. Who are these for? These are solid replacement insoles for Blundstones, given the low-profile design packed with features to support any man on the go. Not only do they add a bit more structure to the shoe, but they’re also ideal for any guy suffering from plantar fasciitis, flat feet, or general foot fatigue. Flaws but not deal-breakers: The padding on these inserts can make your boots extra comfortable. But it will take a few days of wear until they mold to your feet for the perfect fit. Sizes: US 6–12 | Color: Green/gray | Benefit: Arch support, shock absorption, plantar fasciitis relief | Compatible with Blundstones? Yes Best Luxury: Superfeet Low Arch Insoles Why they’re great: The tricky aspect about adding Blundstone boot inserts is that they can take up too much room in the shoe, drastically cutting down on available space for your foot. Instead of cramming your boots to the max, these insoles are low profile for a seamless fit while providing a boatload of support. Rather than a flimsy construction, these insoles have a piece of carbon fiber to structure the inserts and provide backing for the soft foam footbed. The slim design can even be cut down to fit in your boots for the perfect size every time. Who are these for? If you’re seeking long-lasting insoles, these are the best choice, especially as insoles for work boots. The carbon fiber helps the insoles maintain their shape far longer than cheap foam options while cradling the heel to take pressure off the knees and back. These inserts help a variety of ailments, but they’re particularly handy if you need extra arch support, which is still plentiful despite the pared-back design. Flaws but not deal-breakers: These insoles pack plenty into a pretty little package, but given the upgraded design and abundance of features, they have a price tag to match. However, since you won’t need to replace them every few months, they’re a solid investment to last over the long haul. Sizes: US 2.5–15 | Color: Gray, yellow | Benefit: Arch support, stability, shock absorption | Compatible with Blundstones? Yes Best on Amazon: Blundstone Sheepskin Footbed Why they’re great: Blundstones are notoriously practical for four-season wear, but if you need a boost of warmth for winter, these are the best insoles for Blundstones. Made from genuine sheepskin, these inserts create a soft and cozy landing pad for cold toes during the chilly season. Plus, they have structured arch support and extra shock absorption from the thick EVA foam, denoting them a luxurious choice. Insulating from the footbed, they’re the perfect solution to turn your Blundstones into proper winter boots. Who are these for? If you have a pair of Blundstones with thinner insulation, these insoles add a dose of furry warmth. They’re also a great choice for Blundstones made from a thinner leather since it beefs up the interior heat of the shoe. These insoles are actually included in every pair of Thermal Blundstones as a removable footbed. So, if you’re caught between Classics and winter Blunnies, you can always opt for the former and use these insoles for a cross between the two. They’re not heated insoles, but they come pretty close. Flaws but not deal-breakers: You probably won’t reach for these Blundstone inserts during the summer months. But there’s nothing like a nice winter splurge to warm up the coldest days. Sizes: US 4–13 | Color: White | Benefit: Warmth, arch support, shock absorption | Compatible with Blundstones? Yes Best Everyday: Dr. Scholl’s Extra Comfort Support Insoles Why they’re great: Crazy comfort on a budget is in store with these inserts. If you don’t want to opt for branded Blundstone insoles, these offer incredible value and support. Made from a wavy gel pattern (as opposed to standard foam inserts), these insoles are long-lasting and won’t give out, at least not for a few hundred miles. Who are these for? Choose these insoles if you’d like to double down on shock absorption. The gel is designed to distribute weight and cushion each step, leading to a more comfortable stride and a happier body overall. Flaws but not deal-breakers: These insoles have a “Massaging Gel” technology that includes a wave pattern throughout the inserts. Although these insoles are created to cut back on muscle fatigue, some people may not like the feeling of the textured insoles. Sizes: US 8–14 | Color: Blue, orange | Benefit: Comfort, arch support | Compatible with Blundstones? Yes blundstoneusa / Instagram What Makes the Best Insoles for Blundstones? Profile When considering insoles for Blundstones, it’s essential to consider the inserts’ profile to ensure that they fit in the shoes. Blundstones can be narrow and tight, especially right out of the box. If you choose big and bulky insoles, you won’t have enough room in the boots for your feet. And if you do, the arch of your foot will likely touch the top of your shoe, resulting in the boots being more uncomfortable than they were in the first place. For the best replacement insoles for Blundstones, opt for a low-profile pair. The right inserts can still offer plenty of cushion and robust support in a slim package. This is especially important if you’re shopping for insoles for boots like the Original 500s or the Heritage Series, which feature a narrower fit. This may be less of a concern with the Classic 550 Blundstones, which have a roomier construction that can accommodate a more robust pair of insoles. Material Insoles are made from various materials, each offering a unique advantage. Most commonly, insoles are made from soft foam to add cushion to the boots. However, you’ll also find insoles with carbon fiber to support and cut down on odors, gel for a massage effect while walking, and even sheepskin to warm up the feet on frigid days. The insert material comes down to personal preference, but a word to the wise: foam insoles tend to wear out quite quickly, whereas inserts with a bit of structure from plastic, carbon fiber, or gel will last significantly longer. Target Ailment Insoles are designed to treat a range of ailments, from flat feet and low arches to severe back pain, foot fatigue, plantar fasciitis, and beyond. You’ll even find insoles that target the cold with a furry landing pad. It’s important to consider why you’re shopping for insoles and to choose a pair that addresses your specific concerns. For a softer step and to further reduce impact, choose foam inserts to add extra cushion to your boots. These work as great insoles for dress shoes that are too rigid, namely those with leather soles. For added support, consider insoles that cup the heel and lift the center of the foot. For an overall more comfortable fit, opt for gel or sheepskin inserts that add a layer of luxury to the bottom of your boots. blundstoneworkca / Instagram How We Chose To choose the best insoles for Blundstones, the following criteria were used: Brand Reputation: All of the inserts on this list come from a reputable brand well known for making top-quality insoles, ranging from renowned Dr. Scholl’s to Blundstone itself. User Reviews: Each pair of insoles on this list is backed by genuine customer reviews to ensure that they do what they say they will. I read hundreds of comments about every insert option to ensure that only the best ended up on this list. Price: The insoles on this list cover a vast span of prices from under $10 to well over $50. With something for every budget, each individual should be able to find a pair of insoles that work for their uses and budget. Compatibility With Blundstones: Most importantly, each pair of replacement insoles for Blundstones is designed to be compatible with the boots. Because, after all, what good are inserts if they don’t fit in the shoes? Why Trust Us? Aside from wearing her Blundstones daily, Jane is a comfort fanatic and strives to help guys feel their best through her product recommendations. When she’s not sitting on a terrace in Paris, she’s trekking through the backcountry in her Classic 550s or cranking out the latest advice on leather boots, tracksuits, and men’s life essentials for FashionBeans readers. Final Verdict The best overall Blundstone boot inserts are the brand’s Xtreme Comfort Footbed, which have the perfect fit and load up on the cushioning for the most comfortable shoes. For an affordable alternative, the Happystep Memory Foam Arch Support Insoles soften each tread with a memory foam construction and provide additional arch support. FAQ You can absolutely put insoles in Blundstones. In fact, it’s recommended if you spend a lot of time walking or standing in your boots. Adding inserts bolsters up the support and cushioning of Blundstones for an overall more comfortable experience. You can make your Blundstones more comfortable by adding a memory foam insert. This will soften each step, absorb more shock, and offer greater support for your feet, ankles, knees, and back, than you get with the standard Blundstone insoles. Blundstone Classic 550s come with extra insoles so that you can adjust the fit. Considering this style features a wider boot with more room in the toe box, the extra insoles can reduce additional volume in the shoe if you feel like your feet are sliding around too much.

Blundstones can be narrow and tight, especially right out of the box. If you choose big and bulky insoles, you won’t have enough room in the boots for your feet. And if you do, the arch of your foot will likely touch the top of your shoe, resulting in the boots being more uncomfortable than they were in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the best replacement insoles for Blundstones, opt for a low-profile pair. The right inserts can still offer plenty of cushion and robust support in a slim package. This is especially important if you’re shopping for insoles for boots like the Original 500s or the Heritage Series, which feature a narrower fit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis may be less of a concern with the Classic 550 Blundstones, which have a roomier construction that can accommodate a more robust pair of insoles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaterial\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInsoles are made from various materials, each offering a unique advantage. Most commonly, insoles are made from soft foam to add cushion to the boots.

It’s important to consider why you’re shopping for insoles and to choose a pair that addresses your specific concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a softer step and to further reduce impact, choose foam inserts to add extra cushion to your boots.

Blundstones can be narrow and tight, especially right out of the box. If you choose big and bulky insoles, you won’t have enough room in the boots for your feet. And if you do, the arch of your foot will likely touch the top of your shoe, resulting in the boots being more uncomfortable than they were in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the best replacement insoles for Blundstones, opt for a low-profile pair. The right inserts can still offer plenty of cushion and robust support in a slim package. This is especially important if you’re shopping for insoles for boots like the Original 500s or the Heritage Series, which feature a narrower fit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis may be less of a concern with the Classic 550 Blundstones, which have a roomier construction that can accommodate a more robust pair of insoles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaterial\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInsoles are made from various materials, each offering a unique advantage. Most commonly, insoles are made from soft foam to add cushion to the boots. However, you’ll also find insoles with carbon fiber to support and cut down on odors, gel for a massage effect while walking, and even sheepskin to warm up the feet on frigid days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe insert material comes down to personal preference, but a word to the wise: foam insoles tend to wear out quite quickly, whereas inserts with a bit of structure from plastic, carbon fiber, or gel will last significantly longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTarget Ailment\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInsoles are designed to treat a range of ailments, from flat feet and low arches to severe back pain, foot fatigue, plantar fasciitis, and beyond. You’ll even find insoles that target the cold with a furry landing pad. It’s important to consider why you’re shopping for insoles and to choose a pair that addresses your specific concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a softer step and to further reduce impact, choose foam inserts to add extra cushion to your boots.
