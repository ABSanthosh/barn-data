As long as I got you, and you got me, we will be free.”Leading up to the results of Tuesday’s election, she also posted affirmations like “We are better together” and “No matter the challenges, I find purpose in the work we do together.”Ms. Blow, 40, had anticipated that people might feel anxious and stressed about the election. “I wanted to encourage people to know that regardless of what the outcome is, we can still survive together, and we can still get stuff done together,” she said.Ms. Blow’s messages about seeking solace in community are resonating with people who feel disillusioned with the establishment. In the aftermath of the election, as some were quick to celebrate — or mourn — the outcome, and others went about business as usual, many young people on social media have, instead, been campaigning for grass-roots organizing and mutual aid.Juliette Todd, a 19-year-old living in Ann Arbor, Mich., voted for the first time on Tuesday, though she wasn’t satisfied with either candidate for president. But that only made it more important for her to turn to her community for support.“When you have no trust in the system, it only leaves you with yourself and people around you,” Ms. Todd said. “I feel like I have to look out for the people around me because no one else is going to swoop in and do it.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
