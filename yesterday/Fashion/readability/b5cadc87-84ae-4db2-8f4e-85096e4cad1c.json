Are they social events or side hustles?Home cafes, like this one hosted by Ryan Nordheimer, have become popular as a way of gathering friends together. Credit...Christine YangJuly 22, 2025, 5:02 a.m. ETThe week before Morning Jays opens, Nate Crawford and Justen Lambert kick into overdrive.To start, they draft a menu, with three sweet pastries from Mr. Crawford and three savory dishes from Mr. Lambert. Forty-eight hours out, they visit multiple grocery stores — their selections often feature in-season ingredients — and dive into prep, chopping, tasting and tweaking as they go.Come Saturday, they’re up at dawn, jockeying for oven space, brewing coffee, plating and decorating, while setting out to-go cups and totes stamped with the blue Morning Jays logo. Then they slip on branded T-shirts and await their guests.These are not paying customers, however, they’re friends and family. Because Morning Jays is not a real cafe. It’s an apartment in Des Plaines, Ill., made to look and feel like one.For Mr. Crawford and Mr. Lambert, what began as a way to test recipes for their long-term goal of opening a farmer’s market breakfast stall has evolved into a full-fledged apartment cafe complete with signature menus, merch drops, a Substack newsletter and a growing list of people who want to stop by.“We’re really excited about this home cafe, because it offers more hospitality than a classic restaurant does,” said Mr. Lambert, 33, a recipe developer. “It’s more cozy, it’s more intimate and there’s a lot more focus on providing good quality food, because we’re not a restaurant with tons of overhead. We can focus more on making the experience about community building.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
