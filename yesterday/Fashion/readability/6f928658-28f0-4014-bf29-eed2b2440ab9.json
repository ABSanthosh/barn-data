Then my mother had a stroke.Credit...Brian ReaDec. 20, 2024I am in my pajamas, watching a Netflix documentary about space telescopes when I begin to think about my mother.“The iron in our blood and the calcium in our bones was literally formed out of a star that exploded billions of years ago,” the documentary’s excited astrophysicist says.An image of the Southern Ring nebula floats across the screen. “This is a dying star in its last gasp of light,” she explains. It looks like an eye, an iris, a nipple, a womb, a portal opening up in space. I stare at the dying star — taking its last breath, mothering us all.I was with friends in Hell’s Kitchen when I first saw my mother’s brain scans. We were neuroscientists at Princeton in our early 30s, freshly done with our Ph.D.s. A few days earlier my mother — the political scientist, the litigator — had woken up next to my father in their home in Tehran, unable to speak properly, terrified.Her brain scans arrived the night before my hurried flight home in January 2016.When I showed them to my friend James, he gave me a knowing look. We each had scanned over a hundred brains for our memory research. “The stroke is eating my mother’s brain,” I told him as if he didn’t see the dark oval taking over her right hemisphere, a black hole swallowing a star.“Touch her limbs and name them,” I texted my father and sister as I got ready to fly home, leaving my research and one-way work visa behind. “Record your voices, have the nurses play it. Perhaps some brain connections survive.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
