Thankfully, 2025 has plenty of glamorous occasions to keep us entertained as we shake off the shock, dust off our laptops, and jump back into the grind. The Golden Globes kicked off awards season with a long list of fashion and beauty knockout moments. Our favorites of the night were Ayo Edebiri’s ‘90s Julia Roberts-inspired gray Loewe suit, Zendaya’s burnt orange satin Louis Vuitton gown, and Kylie Jenner’s direct homage to Elizabeth Hurley’s backless Versace number, which really got the people talking. While our gaze is fixed on the red carpet for more amazing looks as the season ramps up, we’re also keeping an eye on the exciting launches happening in the fashion and beauty space this month. From a new Fenty Skin cleanser to a Louis Vuitton collaboration, click through to see all the new goodies heading your way this January.Louis Vuitton x Murakami Re-Edition CollectionWith Zendaya fronting the campaign, Louis Vuitton is straight out of the gate with the collaboration of the year.

Now, the two have reunited with a limited-edition collection of lingerie and loungewear. The Araks x J.Crew capsule features a range of underwear and sleepwear featuring bold colors and elegant design details — think ice blue cotton-silk embroidered pajamas, berry-tinted bralettes, and a color-blocked slip dress with scalloped trims. “The pieces are both effortless and considered, chic without trying too hard,” Yeramyan said of the collab. “These are the clothes you’ll reach for without thinking, yet always feel good in.
