She was most recently the creative director at Carven and previously held the same title at Lacoste. \"I am deeply honored to join Bottega Veneta as creative director,\" Trotter said in a statement. \"The house’s storied legacy of artistry and innovation is truly inspiring, and I am excited to contribute to its future and celebrate its timeless vision.\" As for Blazy, he's headed to Chanel.Bottega Veneta's CEO Leo Rongone shed some light on why he chose Trotter for the top job. \"Her aesthetic seamlessly combines exquisite design with sublime craft and her commitment to cultural advocacy aligns beautifully with our brand vision,\" Rongone said in a statement. \"Through her sophisticated lens, Bottega Veneta will continue to celebrate its heritage while preserving modern relevance.\" Scroll down for three fast facts to know about her.(Image credit: Getty Images)1.

She's Also Designed for a Trio of American BrandsTrotter spent her post-college years working in London before moving to New York to serve as vice president of womenswear design at Gap. She then took on design roles at Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger.(Image credit: Getty Images)3. She Studied Marketing and DesignSome fashion designers are self-taught, while others cut their teeth at famous fashion schools such as FIT or Central Saint Martins. Trotter took a slightly unconventional route, opting to study both marketing and design at Northumbria University Newcastle in England. Erin got her start as a Who What Wear intern over 13 years ago—back when the site only published a single story per day. (Who What Wear has since increased that number twentyfold.) She graduated magna cum laude from USC, which is how she ended up moving to Los Angeles from her hometown of San Diego. In college, she also interned at Refinery29, where she was promoted to editorial assistant and then assistant editor. After nearly three years at R29, she came back to WWW in 2016, where she currently holds the title of Associate Director of Fashion News (as well as the unofficial title of resident royal expert—in case you haven't noticed her numerous Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton stories). She spends her days trying to incorporate her idols, Anna Wintour and Roger Federer, into as many stories as possible. Outside of work, she loves tennis, classic rock, traveling, and smothering her dog with affection.",
