Sooner or later, every guy has to face the reality of needing beard dye. The only problem is that some of us have pretty sensitive faces, to the point where even a beard conditioner makes us break out in hives. For a safe dye job, consider the best beard dyes for sensitive skin. Whether you’re grappling with graying or your beard becoming coarse and frizzy, a round of beard dye followed by a good wash is the way to go. It takes a little getting used to, but once you find the perfect product for you, you won’t look back. Skin care routines are complicated enough for guys, but throw allergies and rashes into the mix, and things start to spiral out of control. Thankfully, if you go with our picks, you won’t have to worry about any of that. Now, let’s dive into the best beard dyes for sensitive skin. Key Takeaways After searching the internet high and low, the results are in. For me, the Cleverman Beard Dye Kit has the best hypoallergenic beard dye. Besides giving you more than half a dozen colors to choose from, it throws in shampoo and developer for a very fair price. Most importantly, it works wonders. If your beard is well into the graying period, then Grizzly Mountain Organic Beard Dye is an amazing option. The formula is very gentle on the skin, and with some experimentation, you can get your natural beard color exactly right. In This Article Our PicksBuying ConsiderationsHow We ChoseWhy Trust Us? Final VerdictFAQs truesonsgrooming / Instagram Best Overall: Cleverman Beard Dye Kit Why it’s great: If there’s one thing I love, it’s a quality hair grooming kit. Cleverman has to be the best hypoallergenic beard dye because of just how much it offers. Besides the dye, you get a developer and shampoo, as well as a few nifty applicators. You’ll be done dyeing in just under ten minutes, although the color lasts longer than most. Who is this for? You have eight different colors to choose from here, so if yours is hard to find, chances are you can get it here. It’s also an organic dye, free of ammonia, silicones, and resorcinol. That makes it one of the safest options you can get at any price, let alone such a fair one. Flaws but not deal-breakers: If you’re rocking a full-on silver fox look, then the dye won’t hold for as long as it normally does. This stuff works best when your beard is still showing the first signs of graying. When it works, it works like a dream, though. Facial hair type: All | Colors: 8 | Consistency: Cream Best Budget: KISS Quick Cover Facial Hair Dye Why it’s great: If a full-on kit is a bit much for you, then KISS has your back with a fantastic set of browns and blacks. Alongside the dye itself, you get a brush and a tray to help you out with the application process. Five minutes with this stuff, and you’re all done. Bonus points for the natural extracts in the ingredients list. All of that adds up to one of the best beard dyes for sensitive skin. Who is this for? I’d recommend this to anyone with a dark set of facial hair. The natural black one is especially convincing, so don’t hesitate to get it if that’s what you’re after. For the price, this dye lasts a pretty long time, so don’t worry about having to reapply it too often either. Flaws but not deal-breakers: For all its hypoallergenic ingredients, this stuff also has PPD. If you have a known sensitivity to it, then you might be better off going for something else. Facial hair type: All | Colors: 4 | Consistency: Cream Best Luxury: True Sons Beard Dye Why it’s great: This stuff is among the best-known beard dyes out today, and for good reason. Besides the wide assortment of colors, you get a full kit to work with, including a dye booster to help patch you up when needed. Best of all, it genuinely doesn’t damage your hair in the slightest since the formula is so gentle on the skin. Who is this for? If your beard is closer to white than its original color, then look no further than True Sons. It’s a miracle just how effective this stuff is at covering gray hair, but you won’t hear me complaining. Flaws but not deal-breakers: Nothing bad to say about this one, except maybe I wish there was a little more dye. Either way, it keeps your beard fresh for a good while, so it’s not the biggest deal in the world. Facial hair type: All | Colors: 7 | Consistency: Foam Best on Amazon: Just For Men Beard Dye Why it’s great: When it comes to the best beard dyes for sensitive skin, Just For Men is pretty high up there. This is a no-frills kind of product that works fast and works well. It’s very gentle on your skin thanks to the formula, and it gives your beard a fuller look after a single round of dyeing. Who is this for? For brown-haired dudes, it really doesn’t get much more convenient than this stuff. You’ll also find that it works equally well on mustaches, thin goatees, and just about any style of facial hair. Flaws but not deal-breakers: One thing to consider is that your beard will come out a bit darker than it looks on the box. Whatever your shade of brown, I’d go a tint lighter just to be on the safe side. Facial hair type: All | Colors: 3 | Consistency: Gel Best Everyday: Just For Men Control GX Why it’s great: Okay, so this technically falls under the category of beard wash. Either way, I dare you to find another product that reverses gray hair at such a low cost. Control GX restores your beard’s color, softens it, and it does it all with an ammonia-free formula. Who is this for? Obviously, this is the stuff you use to deal with white and gray hair. Again, I’d almost think of this as a hair maintenance product, but it’s truly amazing at what it does. Flaws but not deal-breakers: There’s no actual dye here, so if you’re aiming for a particular shade, then you may want to look elsewhere. Either way, it never hurts to have this at home – you never know when those first gray hairs might pop up! Facial hair type: Coarse | Colors: / | Consistency: Gel Best for Aging Hair: Grizzly Mountain Organic Beard Dye Why it’s great: With advanced age comes a different set of hair, and a new set of responsibilities too. One of them is maintenance, and Grizzly Mountain works wonders in that regard. This is one the best beard dyes for sensitive skin. It’s a permanent, hypoallergenic hair dye product rich in herbal powder. It’s pretty affordable at that, so don’t hesitate to buy more than one. Who is this for? Anyone who wants to take their hair from gray to brown, that’s who. However coarse your beard is, this wonder product will stick to it and won’t fade after a couple of showers. Flaws but not deal-breakers: The one downside to powder products is that they take a bit of prep work to set up. It’ll take a little longer to get things going, but the end result is well worth it, if you ask me. Facial hair type: Aging, fine | Colors: 2 | Consistency: Powder grizzlymountainbearddye / Instagram Buying Considerations for the Best Beard Dyes for Sensitive Skin Ingredients The best beard dyes for sensitive skin will generally have a safe formula. This could mean anything from organic ingredients to low-ammonia or peroxide picks. Ultimately, it helps to keep close tabs on the ingredient list if your skin is prone to breakouts. Color The biggest mistake that guys make when using dye is mismatching their hair with their beard. A good dye job should be subtle, so try to find the color that’s the most similar to the hair on your head. Skin type Oftentimes, the skin on your face will be more sensitive than the skin on the rest of your body. If you’ve never dyed your beard, then consider how your face responds to most skincare products you use on a day-to-day basis. If everyday hygiene products irritate your skin, then you should probably be careful with beard dye too. thebrianunderwood / Instagram How We Chose The more chemical-rich a cosmetic product is, the tougher it is to sell. Lots of manufacturers have no issue lying to their buyers about the safety and efficacy of their products. We hate vouching for companies like this, so we try to do the most thorough research we can. We consider everything from company reputation to customer satisfaction to ensure that we’ve brought you the best of the best – in this case, the best beard dyes for sensitive skin. Company reputation: Does the company have a proven track record of releasing good products? The cleaner their history, the more likely I am to recommend them. Customer reviews: How do customers rate their purchases? There’s no better judge of a product’s quality than someone who’s tried it, so I always look into reviews. Transparency: Is the company honest about the manufacturing process? The last thing we’d want would be to sell our readers something that just isn’t good for them. Price: Is the product fairly priced for what it does? I wouldn’t want to recommend something if you can get a cheaper alternative that’s just as good, if not better. Why Trust Us?

From beard oils to trimming kits, there’s very little he hasn’t either used or deeply researched.
