Then he hits record and steps back to capture the day’s outfit:A black leather jacket.A bright blue sweater from COS, Margiela loafers and two cups of Raisin Bran for breakfast.A white T-shirt, gray pants and cherry red Nike Air Rifts, which he described as “a calm office fit.”The whole process takes about five minutes. Then he has to upload.“I try to do the same routine every day just to make it cohesive,” he said in a phone interview.Mr. Maddox, a 31-year-old executive assistant at a finance company in Jersey City, N.J., isn’t doing this as part of his day job, but for his side hustle as a fashion content creator on TikTok, where hundreds find inspiration in the looks he put together.Mr. Maddox starts his workday with a photo shoot in the office kitchen area, a process he says takes about five minutes.Credit...Photographs via Xander MaddoxThank you for your patience while we verify access.
