  "description": "As we trade in our tank tops for warmer layers to keep us cozy on chilly days, we’re always keeping an eye out for the best sweaters on the market, whether they're chunky knits or turtlenecks. One style in particular has become an obsession lately: the cardigan.  The button-front jumper has been a longtime staple in fall and winter wardrobes, but it started making headlines a few years ago, when micro versions dominated New York Fashion Week, courtesy of designers like Maryam Nassir Zadeh and Kim Shui. As you can imagine, fashion enthusiasts and celebs ate it up — and they're still excited by them. Cardigans went from kind-of-frumpy-but-beloved to trending, worn by everyone from EmRata to Jennifer Lawrence. And brands are still finding ways to make it feel fresh: At the Fall/Winter 2024 shows, Ulla Johnson and Tibi styled them as capes.From whimsical hues and funky patterns to chunky knits and more classic silhouettes, cardigans are here to complement all your fall ‘fits.

But spring offers another glorious opportunity for knitwear as we trade in our heavier knits for lighter options that add that perfect finishing touch to a layered outfit (not to mention keep us warm on breezier spring days and are perfect for travel). The current style us R29ers have been turning to is: the cardigan.  Cardigans made a stylish comeback in 2022 when micro versions made headlines during New York Fashion Week. Designers like Maryam Nassir Zadeh and Kim Shui debuted tiny cardigans — the cousin to the viral pin tops — during their spring 2022 runways. As you can imagine, fashion enthusiasts and celebs ate it up — and they still are. Currently, these knitted bitties are hitting the streets in all colors and styles as a year round staple, you can see everyone from EmRata to Jennifer Lawrence wearing their cardigans around town. And this spring wardrobe staple will easily take you into next season — at the fall/winter 2024 shows, Ulla Johnson and Tibi used cardigans as capes.From whimsical hues, funky patterns, and chunky knits to classic silhouettes, front-close knits are here to complement your spring fits. Don't worry; we still added a few of the beloved oversized and cable-knit styles for you to throw on.
