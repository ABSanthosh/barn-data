Dowling says: “The main side-effect you may experience with them is digestive issues, but they are generally well tolerated.” If you find them too pricey, you could up your intake with collagen-rich foods such as bone broth, fish and egg whites.This is Anita Bhagwandas’s final beauty advice column for The Guardian Saturday",
