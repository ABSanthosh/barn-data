  "description": "As we embrace the slightly warmer and sunnier days, we’re eager for a fresh start… and a closet refresh. From spring wardrobe essentials like classic trench coats and slouchy carryall bags to fresh wedding guest dresses and do-it-all trousers, Refinery29 editors are opting for functional, versatile, and transitional pieces to round out their spring outfits.However, we’re also excited about more trendy styles, like playful butter-yellow pieces and whimsical bloomer pants. So whether you’re looking for a tried-and-true staple (with a twist) or an unexpected find to liven up your wardrobe, we’ve got recommendations for you. Read on to discover the top spring fashion must-haves that we’re reaching for this season (and think you should, too).All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.Cos Clean Cut Regular Long-Sleeved T-Shirt“I've been reaching for this striped shirt almost daily since I bought it last month. The soft, breathable fabric is perfect for early spring temperatures. What I love most is its versatility: It looks great with jeans when I’m struggling with deciding what to wear, but, thanks to the slim fit, it also makes for a great layering piece under a waistcoat, blazer, or even overalls (as you can see in my photo). When it’s cold, I layer it under another sweatshirt so the colorful collar peeks through. While my exact colorway is sold out, there are a handful of other hues in stock.” — Venus Wong, Senior WriterShop CosCOS Clean Cut Regular Long-Sleeved T-Shirt, $, available at COSPhoto: Courtesy of Venus Wong.Reformation Kensington Trench “Disclaimer: From olive green to black, I own a few trench coats. Some I’ve had for years; others I’ve only recently added to my wardrobe. A well-made trench will last a lifetime, which is why I always say to invest in a really good one. Enter: Reformation’s Kensington trench. I’ve been wearing this one for a few seasons now, and it’s become my go-to staple. The website description says it’s khaki, but I would say it’s closer to a cream color. While I love my black and olive green trench coats, this pared-back shade is ideal for any occasion.” — Susan Devaney, Life Director Shop ReformationReformation Kensington Trench, $, available at ReformationPhoto: Courtesy of Susan Devaney.Madewell Denim Crewneck Vest \u0026 The Curvy Perfect Vintage Wide-Leg Jean “I loveee a Canadian tuxedo in any iteration, but this vest-jean combo may just be my favorite. I own several vests because they’re a versatile wardrobe staple that can be paired with trousers for the office or shorts for casual plans. And this Madewell denim vest is the best addition to my collection. It has a slight stretch that’s very comfortable and a slightly flared silhouette that gives the illusion of an exaggerated hourglass shape. Plus, the dark wash perfectly matches the brand’s Perfect Vintage Wide-Leg Jean. I typically buy Madewell jeans in “curvy petite” fits, but this pair is just “curvy,” and manages not to swallow up my under-5’3” frame. Together, the vest and jeans are an easy look to put together… and look put-together.” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterShop MadewellMadewell Denim Crewneck Vest, $, available at MadewellMadewell The Curvy Perfect Vintage Wide-Leg Jean, $, available at MadewellPhoto: Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.Babaton The Slouch Coat“While I’ve long become a pro at cold-weather dressing (blame it on the almost 20 years that I’ve spent freezing while living on the East Coast), I still find it difficult to find good outerwear for the transitional weather — those days when it’s cold in the morning and warm mid-day. This season, I’ve found my solution in this coat from Aritzia. It’s oversized enough to comfortably fit over sweaters while being lightweight enough to avoid me overheating when it gets warmer (and to carry should I need to take it off). Plus, I love this gray hue, which goes with everything.” — Irina Grechko, Global Fashion DirectorShop AritziaBabaton Coat, $, available at AritziaPhoto: Courtesy of Irina Grechko.Jenny Bird Mini Tome Hoops“I’m a creature of habit and have been wearing the same pair of gold huggies every day for the past few years. I finally decided to mix it up and landed on the silver Mini Tome Hoops from Jenny Bird. I appreciate that they feel substantial without weighing my ears down, and their shape is slightly more chunky and interesting than a standard hoop earring.” — Kate Spencer, Senior Affiliate Partnerships ManagerShop Jenny BirdJenny Bird Mini Tome Hoops, $, available at Jenny BirdPhoto: Courtesy of Kate Spencer.Intimately Forever Young Pants“I first spotted these pants on Pinterest last fall and instantly fell in love — then I stalked the Free People site every day for weeks. Finally, in late November, I managed to snag a pair after a restock, and have been desperately waiting for it to be warm enough to wear them ever since. That time is now! I’m even more in love with them — I feel like an extra in Sofia Coppola’s Marie Antoinette when I wear them. (Note: These are slightly see-through so I suggest wearing tights underneath.)Given that bloomer shorts are having a moment, I’m ready for more bloomer-style pants to shine, especially now that Free People has added more colorway options, which are also tempting me.” — Esther Newman, Affiliate WriterShop Free PeopleIntimately Forever Young Pants, $, available at Free PeoplePhoto: Courtesy of Esther Newman.Barbour Catlin Showerproof Jacket“This is the perfect spring jacket. It’s lightweight, timeless, and goes with almost everything. I love how the pockets fold over so things are more secure inside, as well as the contrasting collar against the light-colored body. I also love the slightly sporty details with the drawstring bottom, freshening up the classic Barbour look. Paired with jeans and sneakers on casual days, you can’t go wrong. While this Sofie style is sold out, the Catlin style is a similar alternative.” — Tanyel Mustafa, Senior WriterShop Bloomingdale’sBarbour Catlin Water Resistant Jacket, $, available at Bloomingdale'sPhoto: Courtesy of Tanyel Mustafa.Brooks Brothers American-Made Oxford Cloth Button-Down Dress Shirt“I’ve never gotten more compliments on a white button-down than on this Brooks Brothers shirt — and for a good reason. The 100% cotton fabric makes it look perfectly structured (and prevents you from overheating or the shirt from wrinkling too much even when worn under a blazer), the silhouette is oversized enough without being boxy, and the subtle monogram (which you can add for $12) adds a special touch to an otherwise simple look.” — Irina Grechko, Global Fashion DirectorShop Brooks BrothersBrooks Brothers American-Made Oxford Cloth Button-Down Dress Shirt, $, available at Brooks BrothersPhoto: Courtesy of Irina Grechko.Away Featherlight Cargo Pack“Shaped like a vintage camera bag, this boxy crossbody bag from Away fits a ton (yet is super lightweight). F(or reference, I fit a swimsuit, coverup, and flip flops into the main compartment, plus a digital camera and portable charger in the side pockets, and my credit cards and lip balm in the front zipper.) I’ve already styled it for festival season and plan to tote it around throughout the seasons.” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterShop AwayAway Featherlight Cargo Pack, $, available at AwayPhoto: Courtesy of Alice Gao.Uniqlo Jersey Barrel Pants“I love a barrel-leg pant, and these ones from Uniqlo have quickly become a wardrobe favorite. They’re just the perfect everyday trouser — comfortable yet stylish and versatile. The best part? Uniqlo’s alteration service. I got them hemmed to my desired length at no extra cost and even got them back the same day! For the price point, you really can’t go wrong.” — Kristine Romano, Associate Editor, Photo \u0026 DesignShop UniqloUniqlo Jersey Barrel Pants, $, available at UniqloPhoto: Courtesy of Kristine Romano.Lululemon Slouchy Sling Bag 6L“Lululemon’s belt bags have been massive for a hot minute now, and I predict this slouchy sling will be the next viral hit. I love the crescent shape, which feels very on-trend, and it holds a surprising amount of stuff despite its smaller size. I was able to fit my umbrella and water bottle in it, in addition to my wallet, phone, and portable power bank. The double-zipped pockets (great for keys and earbuds) are so practical, as is the fact that this style can be converted into a crossbody bag. Did I mention that it's also waterproof?” — Venus Wong, Senior WriterShop LululemonLululemon Slouchy Sling Bag 6L, $, available at LululemonPhoto: Courtesy of Venus Wong.Dr. Martens Buzz 5-eye Grizzly Leather Shoes“Doc Martens shoes that are comfortable fresh out of the box! I want to shout loud and proud about these bad boys — my latest and greatest obsession. Trust me, I’ve already been stomping around in them plenty to test them out, and I’ve not suffered one blister (all in thin, normal, cotton socks, too, might I add). As a petite gal, I love that these give me all the platform-boosting height that the classic Jadon boots do, but that is a lighter silhouette for spring.At the moment, I’ve been wearing them with jeans, but I can’t wait until it’s warm enough to pair them with my prettiest spring dresses; I love that tough-meets-soft and femme vibe (it makes me think of ‘90s Riot Grrrl and grunge icons like Kat Bjelland and Courtney Love).” — Esther Newman, Affiliate WriterShop Zappos Dr. Martens Buzz 5-Eye Grizzly Leather Shoes, $, available at ZapposPhoto: Courtesy of Esther Newman.Damson Madder Butter Floral Embroidery Rue Shirt“Butter yellow is in, which is good for me because yellow pops against my tanned olive skin in such a flattering way. As always with Damson Madder, I love the high-quality materials and special touches. There’s subtle red stitching near two of the sleeve buttons, embroidery details on the front, and a pearl button at the neck.I love this oversized top paired with light blue jeans. When it gets warmer, I’ll go with a gingham skirt. Overall, it's the butter yellow shirt to end all butter yellow shirts.” — Tanyel Mustafa, Senior WriterShop Damson MadderDamson Madder Butter Floral Embroidery Rue Shirt, $, available at Damson MadderPhoto: Courtesy of Tanyel Mustafa.Aligne Henry Slim Barrel Jeans“Barrel-leg jeans are certainly having a moment. But, if like me, you can’t fully commit to this  new denim silhouette just yet, then give Aligne’s slim version a go. I’ve been wearing these jeans for a couple of months now, and not only do they go with everything but they’re so comfy, too. I really like the classic dark blue shade and can’t wait to wear them with an oversized white shirt and sandals come summer.” — Susan Devaney, Life Director Shop AligneAligne Henry Slim Barrel Jeans, $, available at AlignePhoto: Courtesy of Susan Devaney.Jaded London Osmium Studded Leather Bag “A statement bag is one of my favorite ways to liven up an outfit; thanks to the studded detailing, the leather bag is head-turning while still being subtle enough to be used for the everyday. While you might think the metal hardware would weigh the bag down, it actually feels super lightweight. It also has an adjustable strap and a handy inner pocket. If you’re looking for a spring bag with some edge, this is it.” — Alicia Lansom, Associate EditorShop Selfridges Jaded London Osmium Studded Leather Bag, $, available at SelfridgesPhoto: Courtesy of Alicia Lansom.Leset Pointelle Sleeveless Crew“I was drawn to these sweet pointelle tanks from Leset because of the boxy shape and the high crew neck (I like a sliver of my T-shirt collar sticking out from my sweaters). I picked this up in white and black and have already layered them under button-up shirts and outerwear, but am equally looking forward to wearing them alone with jeans and skirts when the weather finally turns.” — Kate Spencer, Senior Affiliate Partnerships ManagerShop LesetLESET Pointelle Sleeveless Crew, $, available at LesetPhoto: Courtesy of Kate Spencer.Hill House Home The Dominique Dress“With wedding season back in full swing, I’ve been on the hunt for spring wedding guest dresses that are both pretty and comfortable enough to wear for the all-day occasion. The classic Hill House Home Nap Dress is what I’ve gravitated to in the past, but I’m very glad I gave the more loose-fitting Dominique style a try. It’s slightly more modest, with a higher neckline and short sleeves shirred at the shoulder seams. This gives a ruffled look that flits and floats with every movement. Combined with the romantic floral pattern, it’s a dress that encapsulates spring perfectly.” — Venus Wong, Senior WriterShop Hill House HomeHill House Home The Dominique Dress, $, available at Hill House HomePhoto: Courtesy of Venus Wong.Adidas Taekwondo Lace Shoes“Sure, Sambas and Gazelles have been a fan-favorite sneaker for years, but I’m currently loving the under-the-radar-turned-viral Adidas Taekwondo. The slim silhouette and thin sole remind me of a soccer cleat, and I love that sporty look. And while this style is naturally great for athleisure outfits, I’ve also styled them with work separates.” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterShop AdidasAdidas Taekwondo Lace Shoes, $, available at AdidasPhoto: Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.Mango Silk Blouse with Asymmetrical Neckline“I got this top in February, and have worn it at least once a week since then. Thanks to its voluminous collar and pretty green color, it’s the perfect layer to dress up my go-to pantsuits or throw underneath a leather jacket or coat for a dramatic flourish that doesn’t require much styling (or time getting ready).” — Irina Grechko, Global Fashion DirectorShop MangoMango Silk Blouse with Asymmetrical Neckline, $, available at MangoPhoto: Courtesy of Irina Grechko.Prada PRA05V Eyeglasses“I need to wear glasses every day due to my poor eyesight, so I like to have options for different styles to suit various outfits and occasions. These are a little out of my comfort zone as they’re a fairly thick frame, but changing things up is good! The brown tone matches my hair color perfectly and complements my skin tone, bringing everything together. The slightly squared-off edges feel retro, too, but also unique. ” — Tanyel Mustafa, Senior WriterShop Glasses USAPrada Prada PRA05V Eyeglasses, $, available at Glasses USAPhoto: Courtesy of Tanyel Mustafa.Núnoo Maxi Dandy Braided Mountain Bag“This is the perfect everyday bag! Not only is it super roomy (it fits my 16” laptop with ease — a rarity), but it also sits comfortably on my shoulder with zero slippage. Made from genuine leather, I know it will last. The woven texture also adds a unique and fun touch to any outfit. It's very quickly become my go-to work bag, and I can easily see it staying in my rotation for seasons to come.” — Kristine Romano, Associate Editor, Photo \u0026 DesignShop NúnooNunoo Maxi Dandy Braided Mountain Bag, $, available at NúnooPhoto: Courtesy of Kristine Romano.Cozy Earth Studio Cropped Wide Leg Pant“Leave it to Cozy Earth, a brand beloved by R29 editors for its uber-soft sleepwear, to make the best travel pants. The modal-spandex blend on this style feels just like wearing my favorite Cozy Earth PJs, and the material dries quickly. These pants have held up beautifully through laundering without any pilling or shape loss.The sleek, wide-leg silhouette looks very put-together, and the cropped length is perfect for my 5'1\" frame. The drawstring waist offers generous stretch, which is great for when I need to contort myself in various positions on a long-haul flight in economy class. You bet I’ll be wearing these pants on repeat on my trip to Japan and China next month.” — Venus Wong, Senior WriterShop Cozy EarthCozy Earth Studio Cropped Wide Leg Pant, $, available at Cozy EarthPhoto: Courtesy of Venus Wong.Significant Other Coralie Maxi Dress “I’m always wary about ordering maxi dresses online since I’m under 5’3”, but this style actually hits at my ankles, which is a big win. The ribbed knit is very stretchy and comfortable. And while the dress feels lightweight and breezy (making it great for spring weddings and parties), it’s also lined, giving it a thickness that offers some warmth and makes it look expensive.I’ve noticed that the brown appears differently under different lights, but whether it’s more of an olive or chocolate, it achieves that trendy Mocha Moose look. Bonus: The high neckline is a statement in itself, so I don’t have to worry about adding a necklace.” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterShop Significant OtherSignificant Other Coralie Maxi Dress, $, available at Significant OtherPhoto: Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.LilySilk Full Bias Cut Silk Pant“I’m all about elevated comfort, and I feel like a silky pant — with an elastic waistband — is the perfect spring transitional style and wardrobe staple. Although an investment, this navy pair from Lilysilk is high-quality, should last many many years, and makes me feel like I’m wearing pajama pants. Plus, when paired with a sweater, button-up, or blazer, these pants can be dressed up for any occasion. I’m now eyeing a pair in black, too.” — Kate Spencer, Sr. Affiliate Partnership ManagerShop LilySilkLilySilk Full Bias Cut Silk Pants, $, available at LilySilkPhoto: Courtesy of Kate Spencer.Sken Studios Smiley Heart Signet Ring“I am a jewelry magpie. I usually have at least one ring on every finger. (My husband recently said, 'You’ve run out of space on your hands!' to which I vehemently disagreed.) I just love to drench myself in gold shiny jewelry — it makes me feel connected to my Indian heritage. This Sken Studios signet has taken permanent residency upon my forefinger, and so many people have commented on it. I particularly love the smiley face! It brings me so much joy.” — Humeara Mohamed, Contributing Writer Shop Sken StudiosSken Studios Smiley Heart Signet Ring, $, available at Sken StudiosPhoto: Courtesy of Humeara Mohamed.Jenny Bird Art Heart Button Earrings“I’m really getting into the look of irregular jewelry and asymmetrical fashion. These heart-shaped earrings are a subtle take on that. Hearts can look a bit juvenile to me, but the reversed look makes them feel more grown up and sophisticated. Edgy even. Plus the backs of these are so thick and sturdy, there’s no way they’re going to accidentally fall off while I’m rushing around London.” — Tanyel Mustafa, Senior WriterShop Jenny BirdJenny Bird Art Heart Button Earrings, $, available at Jenny BirdPhoto: Courtesy of Tanyel Mustafa.Never Fully Dressed Reversible Soller Quilted Jacket“This is basically me in jacket form. The colorful, tarot card-like designs? The clashing leopard-print base and contrasting orange trim? The versatility of the reversible wear? I’m obsessed! Even better, this Never Fully Dressed jacket is thin enough to layer up under coats for winter and light enough for spring into summer. I can see myself getting a lot of wear out of this. I’ve already got plans to take it to Glastonbury Festival with me!” — Esther Newman, Affiliate WriterShop Never Fully DressedNever Fully Dressed Reversible Soller Quilted Jacket, $, available at Never Fully DressedPhoto: Courtesy of Esther Newman.Rise \u0026 Fall Cashmere Merino Knitted Hood“None of my favorite jackets or coats have hoods, which is a travesty that seems to haunt womenswear, much like our blatant lack of pockets. While I wait for fashion designers to remember that London is really rather cold and rainy, I’m turning to Rise \u0026 Fall’s cashmere balaclavas — they look chic, keep my hair dry from spring showers, and warm my ears when cycling. Tick, tick, and tick!” — Humeara Mohamed, Contributing Writer Shop Rise \u0026 FallRise \u0026 Fall Cashmere Merino Knitted Hood, $, available at Rise \u0026 FallPhoto: Courtesy of Humeara Mohamed.Shapermint Essentials All Day Every Day Scoop Neck Bodysuit“I had never tried Shapermint before receiving a NYFW survival guide package — and this bodysuit was the most versatile piece for me, since it can also be worn as shapewear. I’ve tried it hidden under a dress for some smooth compression and extra warmth, and also paired with an open blazer and jeans. I’ve worn it with and without a bra, and it works both ways, too. I particularly love this dusty blue color, which makes me want to show it off, so I’m looking forward to styling it with denim shorts and maxi skirts throughout the spring.” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterShop ShapermintShapermint Shapermint Essentials All Day Every Day Scoop Neck Body, $, available at ShapermintPhoto: Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.Like what you see?
