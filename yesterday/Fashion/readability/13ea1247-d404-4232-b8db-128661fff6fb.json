  "text": "From the big screen to the red carpet, Nico Parker is living the dream. In a brief few years, the actress has starred in several major projects, including Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, The Last of Us, and, most recently, as Astrid Hofferson in the highly anticipated live-action version of How to Train Your Dragon (based on the hit movie and book of the same name released in 2010 and 2003, respectively). Last night, the BAFTA-nominated actress and Chanel ambassador attended the film’s L.A. premiere, stepping out on the red carpet in a gorgeous rose-colored gown fresh off the house’s fall/winter 2025 runway, styled by Rebecca Corbin-Murray. When Parker initially saw the look from the show, it was love at first sight. The floor-length dress was accented by a tiered ruffled skirt and delicate bows. She layered a sheer silk shawl over the ensemble, enhancing its ethereal, fairy-tale charm.The fashion didn’t stop there. There was also a stunning assortment of Chanel fine jewelry on display that brought out the soft undertones of the blush pink, including two rings and a pair of earrings. The overall vibe exuded a princess-like elegance—precisely what Parker and Corbin-Murray aimed for, and perfectly suited to the fun, fantasy-filled action film. On the carpet, Parker posed alongside her co-star Mason James, who plays her romantic interest, Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III. Below, see how she got ready for her big night.",
