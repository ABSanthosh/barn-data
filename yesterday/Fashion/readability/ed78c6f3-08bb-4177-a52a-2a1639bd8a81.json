  "description": "If there's any celebrity you can count on to nail any and every aesthetic, trend, or fad, it's Lady Gaga. The Grammy-winning singer is completely unabashed when it comes to taking risks in her artistry as a whole, but her style, perhaps most of all, knows no bounds. Of course, we all remember her iconic outfit for the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards - a dress, hat, boots, and purse made entirely out of raw beef, designed by Franc Fernandez. The look garnered so much attention that it was listed by Time as the top fashion statement of that year (and it has its own Wikipedia page!). Fast-forward to present day, and the artist born Stefani Germanotta is still crafting her own lane of style as she promotes her latest album, \"Mayhem,\" which she'll be taking on the road starting in July. Apart from the otherworldly visuals, surrealist dance routines, and captivating vocals, you can expect Lady Gaga's tour outfits to deliver just as much drama for us to be inspired by for years to come. In true Gaga fashion, she's created mind-blowing visuals to accompany the album's most major hits, like \"Abracadabra.\" In the video, we see the singer's limitless sartorial abilities even more, namely a custom Samuel Lewis x Suman Gurung x Ilona lace ensemble accompanied by a stiffened, dramatic collar and tiered train - giving us firsthand inspiration for the tour. In case Elizabethan-inspired clothing isn't exactly your style, you can take notes from Gaga's previous eras while planning your concert look. Think exaggerated denim and embellished accessories inspired by her \"Marry the Night\" video, or loud, leopard looks like the jumpsuit she wore in her and Beyoncé's boundary-pushing anthem \"Telephone.\" And if you can't make a strict decision on which Gaga-approved aesthetic to channel, we've done the legwork and rounded up the best concert outfit ideas for you to shop. From gaudy jewelry to dramatic denim from favorites like Nordstrom and Revolve, these are the best Lady Gaga-inspired fashion finds to get for The \"Mayhem\" Ball.",
