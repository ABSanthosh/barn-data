The collection features gingham dresses, lounge sets and new patterns of Frankies Bikinis' swimwear including suede and denim swim textures. Styled by Hadid and Molly Dickson, Hadid stars in the collection's Western-inspired campaign, which is set on Alana O'Herlihy's ranch. \"This collaboration means so much to me,\" Hadid said in a statement. \"I love creating, but to be able to do it with someone you love and collaborate well with is even better. Not only am I so proud of this collection that we worked so hard on, but to do it alongside one of my oldest friends makes it all the more special.\" Bella Hadid x Frankies Bikinis includes 108 pieces total and will be released in three drops, the first on March 4 at 9 a.m. PST (12 p.m. EST) on frankiesbikinis.com, followed by drops in April and June. {Fashionista inbox}Carol's Daughter founder reacquires brand from L'OréalL'Oréal U.S.A. sold textured hair-care brand Carol's Daughter back to its founder and new President Lisa Price and an independent beauty entrepreneur. Founded in Brooklyn, Carol's Daughter has been a leader in the hair-care space for more than 30 years, and now will begin a new chapter with Price obtaining an equity stake in the partnership. L'Oréal U.S.A. is working closely with Price and the new business partner to ensure a seamless transition. \"Today I begin a new chapter and reclaim the indie spirit of my brand as its forever founder and newly appointed president,\" Price announced on the brand's Instagram page. \"Join me as we transition to a new partnership and chart out path forward. This next chapter: It's bolder. It's fearless. It's about innovation that doesn't just follow trends, but sets them. Most importantly, it's about deepening our commitment to you, the community that built us.\" {L'Oréal; Instagram}Jacquemus confirms new CEOJacquemus confirmed Sarah Benady as its new CEO. Benady, who most recently served as Celine's North America president, officially assumed the role on Tuesday. Founder Simon Porte Jacquemus has been working as the brand's creative director and CEO since Bastien Daguzan stepped down in December 2023. Now, Jacquemus and Benady are exploring more international markets, building the brand's retail network and entering the beauty category with L'Oréal as its long-term licensee and new minority investor. \"When I first spoke with Simon, I immediately felt that he was the designer of our century,\" Benady told WWD. \"There is something very special about him — his energy, his work, his authenticity. There's something very solar, very warm and you just want to be around him and be surrounded by that. There is nothing more energizing than to be able to support his vision and the brand.\" {WWD/paywalled}Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesMiu Miu sees record 93% retail growth in 2024Prada Group released its full-year financial results for 2024 on Tuesday, which showed solid growth for Prada and Miu Miu as well as net revenues of $5.4 billion (up 17% year-over-year). Miu Miu experienced 93% retail growth year-over-year, supported by all categories and regions, while Prada saw retail sales rise by 4%. Despite the luxury slowdown, Prada Group saw double-digit growth in Asia Pacific, Europe, Japan and Middle East. \"We are pleased to see that our strategy continued to deliver above-market performance, notwithstanding the challenging environment,\" Patrizio Bertelli, Prada Group chairman and executive director, said in a statement. \"This success underscores the enduring relevance of our brands, which comes from an unwavering focus on product innovation, quality, craftsmanship and a unique ability to read contemporaneity.\" {Prada Group}'Buy Canadian' becomes a beauty rallying cry as Trump's tariffs loomAfter Donald Trump announced 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, a WhatsApp group for Canadian beauty startup founders soon formed the Shop Canadian Indie Beauty Collective, a website listing domestic offerings from brands like Everist, Graydon and Sahajan. Founders, retailers and investors are concerned about the potential of the tariffs to force them to choose between denting margins or raising prices. Before the tariffs went into effect on Tuesday, Canadian beauty brands (who are dependent on U.S. exports) have been rushing to send products to U.S. warehouses. \"Buy Canadian\" social media posts and ads have also popped up, emphasizing support for Canadian beauty brands. If the 25% tariffs remain in effect, Canada's beauty startup scene will be hit hard as goods will cost significantly more. {Business of Fashion/paywalled}A 'Made in L.A.' brand's plan to rebuild after the firesThe denim brand Mother's first store and merchandise worth $1 million burned to the ground in the Pacific Palisades wildfires. Co-founders Lela Becker and Tim Kaeding plan to rebuild, targeting an opening date later this year for a new store, hopefully in the same location. During rebuilding, Mother is finding a new purpose for many items it had planned to use in the store: a marketing campaign intended to draw shoppers to Pacific Palisades is being deployed outside of L.A., photography of Mother's spring arrivals will sit in a window at Harrods in London and exclusive store merchandise was sold off to raise money for fire aid charities. Mother's L.A. manufacturing and headquarters were spared from the fires, enabling the brand to remake lost items. \"There is a beauty about still being able to make things in L.A. and support the same people we've been working with for decades,\" Kaeding told Business of Fashion. \"We are more committed than ever to supporting our L.A. community.\" {Business of Fashion/paywalled}A lot of Oscars dresses looked a little too perfectAriana Grande made headlines in her pale pink couture gown from Schiaparelli's Spring 2025 collection at the Oscars, which The Washington Post's Rachel Tashjian notes exemplified \"the ultimate Oscar dress\" in its perfection. This level of polish was seen in most of the looks from the award show, encapsulating how weight loss drugs, photo editing and AI-generated imagery \"have ushered in an outrageous drive for perfection that has overtaken Hollywood.\" Hollywood once seemed to be leaning into body positivity, but Ozempic has brought in an attitude of body exclusivity, expecting women to appear thinner and younger than ever. {The Washington Post/paywalled}Tommy Hilfiger and Sofia Richie Grainge launch co-created capsuleTommy Hilfiger and brand ambassador Sofia Richie Grainge collaborated on a capsule collection called \"Sofia for Tommy.\" Ranging in price from $49.50 to $399, the 24-piece collection features tailored blazers, wide-leg denim, tanks and dresses that draw inspiration from archival prep silhouettes and vintage nautical flags. \"Tommy is a true icon of style,\" Grainge said in a statement. \"He is someone I've looked up to as a designer and a creative force ever since I started working in the fashion industry. I'm so proud to introduce a collection that embodies effortless sophistication for the everyday. These pieces were built for limitless self-expression and a deep love of authentic, classic style — values that Tommy and I both share.\" The Sofia for Tommy capsule collection will be available on tommy.com, macys.com and at select flagship Macy's locations in New York, Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles and more, beginning on March 4.

Mother\u0026#39;s L.A. manufacturing and headquarters were spared from the fires, enabling the brand to remake lost items. \u0026#34;There is a beauty about still being able to make things in L.A. and support the same people we\u0026#39;ve been working with for decades,\u0026#34; Kaeding told \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/retail/made-in-la-brand-plan-to-rebuild-after-fires/\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBusiness of Fashion\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. \u0026#34;We are more committed than ever to supporting our L.A. community.\u0026#34; {\u003ca href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/retail/made-in-la-brand-plan-to-rebuild-after-fires/\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBusiness of Fashion\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e/paywalled}\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"a-lot-of-oscars-dresses-looked-a-little-too-perfect\"\u003eA lot of Oscars dresses looked a little too perfect\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fashionista.com/tag/ariana-grande\"\u003eAriana Grande\u003c/a\u003e made headlines in her pale pink couture gown from \u003ca href=\"https://fashionista.com/designers/schiaparelli\"\u003eSchiaparelli\u003c/a\u003e\u0026#39;s \u003ca href=\"https://fashionista.com/seasons/spring-2025\"\u003eSpring 2025\u003c/a\u003e collection at the \u003ca href=\"https://fashionista.com/tag/oscars\"\u003eOscars\u003c/a\u003e, which \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/fashion/2025/03/03/fashion-oscars-dresses-ariana-grande/\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Washington Post\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u0026#39;s Rachel Tashjian notes exemplified \u0026#34;the ultimate Oscar dress\u0026#34; in its perfection.
