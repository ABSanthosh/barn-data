  "text": "Copenhagen Fashion Week (even without some of the city's biggest designer names) marks the unofficial beginning of fashion month, preceding New York's more-official kickoff with five days of Danish fashion. That means we got a sneak peek at some of the Fall 2025 trends that are likely to continue in the other fashion capitals. Copenhagen is a city known for its influential street style, elevated-yet-practical design and environmentally responsible production, so it trends are always worth keeping an eye on.This season really put the spotlight on the Danes' knack for savvy cold-weather styling: cozy headscarves, statement gloves, bold (mostly faux) fur and genius layering with a preppy undertone. Head-to-toe denim was exceedingly popular, while on the less-casual end of the spectrum, many designers still had last year's corporate-core trend in mind.Keep scrolling for the biggest Fall 2025 trends from Copenhagen Fashion Week.HeadscarvesThe Danes are experts when it comes to cold-weather dressing that actually looks cool (just take a look at this season's street style), so it's no surprise that they incorporated an array of stylish head coverings into their fall collections. Knit headscarves were especially popular as seen at Skall Studio, A. Roege Hove, Birrot and more.Cropped BombersUpdate: After trending for several seasons, bomber jackets are still going strong. For Fall 2025, Danish designers prioritized cropped versions in heavy fabrics like leather, suede and shearling.Denim on DenimDenim seems to be an increasingly popular fabric choice for every type of garment. Copenhagen designers tended to style it head-to-toe. Baum und Pferdgarten's dress-over-pants and OperaSport's dark denim suit are highlights.2010s Outerwear TrendsAfter a few seasons of minimalist, single-breasted jackets and coats being the epitome of chic, double-breasted styles seem to be making their way back into the trend cycle. Toggle coats, another, related 2010s-era outerwear trend, also made several appearances on Copenhagen runways. It's giving peak Alexa Chung.Swathed in (Faux) FurThere was a lot of fur on the Copenhagen runways, most of it with a retro tinge, from '70s bohemian oversized coats at Nicklas Skovgaard and The Garment, to dyed styles at Rotate Birger Christensen that give '80s glam. Meanwhile, Cmmn Swdn and OperaSport had models stylishly carry fur coats and accessories in their arms instead of wearing them.Statement GlovesGloves may traditionally be associated more with function than fashion, but leave it to Copenhagen to beautifully marry the two, as seen via colorful driving gloves and luxurious opera gloves in leather and knit.PinstripesFor those still obsessed with corporate-core, there's plenty of office-ready tailoring on offer for Fall 2025, much of it done in pinstripes, a pattern most associated with men's suits.Preppy LayeringPrep and academia also continue to trend for Fall 2025; on the Copenhagen runways, this gave designers (and their stylists) a chance to show off their layering skills. Turtlenecks, button-downs, cardigans, coats and more were layered as thoughtfully and cleverly as we've ever seen, as if straight out of an early-'90s J.Crew catalog.Green TightsThis is definitely a microtrend, but an intriguing one: No fewer than four Copenhagen designers styled looks with green tights.
