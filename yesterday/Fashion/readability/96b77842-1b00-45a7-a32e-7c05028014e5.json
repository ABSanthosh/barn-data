As artistic director of the house’s menswear operation, the British designer collaborated with brands like Nike and artists including Raymond Pettibon. He closed out his tenure with a show last week at Paris Men’s Fashion Week and was named a Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur, France’s highest civilian honor.In a statement, Jones called it “a true honor to have been able to create my collections within the house of Dior, a symbol of absolute excellence.” He thanked the members of his studio and “the artists and friends I have met through my collaborations. Lastly, I feel sincere gratitude towards Bernard and Delphine Arnault, who have given me their full support.”Sean Zanni//Getty ImagesJones attends the 2023 Met Gala with Kate and Lila Grace Moss.Added Dior CEO Delphine Arnault, “I am extremely grateful for the remarkable work done by Kim Jones, his studio, and the ateliers. With all his talent and creativity, he has constantly reinterpreted the House’s heritage with genuine freedom of tone and surprising, highly desirable artistic collaborations.” It’s not the designer’s first crack at this season’s game of fashion musical chairs (which, in case you need a refresher, has included Matthieu Blazy going to Chanel, Louise Trotter heading to Bottega Veneta, Michael Rider taking over at Celine, and Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez stepping down from Proenza Schouler). Jones left his post as artistic director of haute couture, ready-to-wear, and fur collections at Fendi, where he had been since 2020, this past fall. A successor has not yet been named.",
