Keep reading to discover all of our top picks below. In This ArticleOur PicksBuying ConsiderationsWhy You Should Trust Us Final VerdictFAQs chrome_industries / Instagram Best Overall: Osprey Transporter Roll Top Backpack Why It’s Great: If you’ve ever owned an Osprey backpack, you know how great they are (trust me, I have three). The brand has perfected the art of the ideal backpack, and this roll top option lives up to the company’s stellar reputation. Unlike Osprey’s usual offerings, the Transporter is less hiking and more commuting, with a roomy main compartment, top grab handle, and my personal favorite feature, the external 16-inch laptop sleeve. This backpack makes airport security a breeze, and the water-resistant shell can withstand pretty much anything Mother Nature throws its way. How It Feels: Osprey has mastered the art of a comfortable backpack, and the Transporter is no exception. You can wear this bad boy all day without wanting to rip it off. There’s a sternum strap and a low-profile hip belt to help distribute the load. Not to mention the breathable back panel and lightweight design. Flaws But Not Dealbreakers: It’s hard to fault this backpack for anything. The only feature some users may take issue with is the hook and loop closure over the roll top instead of the traditional buckle. But if you ask me, this unique feature only adds to the backpack’s charm. Material: Water repellant recycled polyester | Dimensions: 20 x 14 x 11 in | Colors: 9 | Capacity: 25L Best Everyday: Rains Roll Top Rucksack  Why It’s Great: Out of all the roll top backpacks on this list, the Rains rendition is the one I see in person the most. From New York City to the streets of Paris, stylish guys worldwide sport this waterproof bag, making it, without a doubt, one of the best roll top backpacks for men. Completely weatherproof and the perfect work bag, this backpack has enough space for the essentials and not much else. It’s a slim design without any bulk. However, there’s an external pocket and zippered laptop access, so you don’t have to unpack your entire back to reach your tech. How It Feels: A dream to wear, this backpack sits slightly higher on the back than most to keep it from weighing you down on your commute. There’s also a handy chest strap to keep it locked in place while riding a bike or taking the subway. It’s not as padded as some of the other options on the list, but with limited space, you may find that it’s not necessary. Flaws But Not Dealbreakers: The Rains roll top backpack is only thirteen liters, which is significantly smaller than most others on this list. Though, with this in mind, if you’re looking for a barebones backpack to take to the office, you won’t find anything better than this. Material: Polyester with waterproof polyurethane coating | Dimensions: 18.8 x 12.6 x 4.3 in | Colors: 1 | Capacity: 13L Best Waterproof: Tropicfeel Waterproof Daypack Why It’s Great: Waterproof, highly versatile, and made for adventures, this is the best roll top backpack for rugged use. Tropicfeel makes some of the coolest travel gear out there, and this backpack hits all the sweet spots. Some aspects we love include the internal pocket, the outer bungee cords, and the padded straps to keep you comfy on the go. How It Feels: This bag feels like nothing – until it’s packed. Made from extremely lightweight materials, it’ll take you places near and far. Bring it on the boat or to work in a rainstorm, the options are endless. Flaws But Not Dealbreakers: Twelve liters is pretty small for an everyday backpack. It also lacks organization, which we like to see in most backpacks. With this in mind, it’s the ultimate adventure companion, ideal for hiking, day trips, and wet escapades. Material: Polyester with waterproof PVC coating | Dimensions: 15.7 x 9.8 x 3.9 in | Colors: 3 | Capacity: 12L Best on Amazon: Chrome Industries Cargo Roll Top Backpack Why It’s Great: This roll top backpack can fit it all and then some. Perfect for travel or wet weather adventures, this bag is waterproof and supremely durable. The entire front of the bag is covered in elastic webbing to fit extra gear, while the interior of the bag has a waterproof liner with a 15-inch (non-padded) laptop sleeve and enough room for daily essentials. There are even external pockets for further organization, perfect for bikers, nomads, and everyone in between. Recently, I’ve seen a ton of guys rocking this backpack in New York City, namely those on bicycles. How It Feels: While the backpack itself is a bit heavy, it’s designed for ease of carry and comfort. The shoulder straps are lined with EVA foam for extra padding, and the back panel is breathable, with a chest strap to balance the load. Flaws But Not Dealbreakers: Given the twenty-two liter capacity and the internal sleeve, this backpack has a limited amount of interior space. But this is easily made up for with the external pockets and the stretchy cargo net system on the front of the bag. Material: Nylon shell with a waterproof liner | Dimensions: 21 x 11.5 x 5.5 in | Colors: 12 | Capacity: 18L rolled, 22L unrolled Best Budget: Fjallraven High Coast Foldsack Backpack Why It’s Great: We all know those dinky square Fjallraven bags, but hey, the Swedish brand knows a thing or two about backpacks. The High Coast is one of the best roll top backpacks for guys looking for a roomy solution. Coming in eight stand-out colors, the bag has an eternal front pocket, hook and loop closure, and sternum and hip straps to help even out a heavy carry.  Some reviewers go as far as calling it the best backpack they’ve ever bought, ideal for the office, outdoor trips, or airplane travel. How It Feels: The backpack itself is super lightweight and comfortable to carry, thanks to the padded shoulder straps and back panel. Flaws But Not Dealbreakers: This bag is made from a thinner material than most others on this list, giving it a less rugged feel than typical roll top backpacks. Material: Recycled nylon | Dimensions: 17.7 x 10 x 7.8 in | Colors: 8 | Capacity: 24L Most Durable: Carhartt Nylon Roll Top Backpack Why It’s Great: No one does durable gear quite like Carhartt. From the city streets to the job site and beyond, this backpack gets things done – in style. Employing the brand’s signature water-repellant canvas, you’ll be hard-pressed to find another backpack with this kind of organization. The body is covered with external pockets (there are even pen sleeves), while the inside has a dedicated laptop compartment and a whopping forty liters to fill with all your essentials. And then there’s the greatest feature of any backpack on the list: a built-in bottle opener on the hook closure, officially crowning you king of happy hour. If you’re looking for a larger roll top backpack, this is a prime pick. How it Feels: Heavily padded and a breeze to carry, this is one of the most ergonomic backpacks on this list. Aside from the ultra-cushioned back panel designed with enhanced airflow, the adjustable straps have a sternum belt to distribute weight and a top grab handle. It’s a great alternative to a duffel bag for a weekend trip. Flaws But Not Dealbreakers: This backpack is definitely on the bulkier side, and it’s pretty wide. However, it’s also one of the largest on this list, making it perfect for weekends away or as an airplane carry-on. Material: Nylon canvas with durable water-repellent (DWR) coating | Dimensions: 19.5 x 14.5 x 8 in | Colors: 4 | Capacity: 40L Best Rugged: Earth Pak Summit Dry Bag Backpack Why It’s Great: You can fish this bag off of the ocean floor, and everything inside will still be dry. A drybag backpack hybrid, this Earth Pak roll top is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a tactical carryall. It’s kitted out with all sorts of unique features, with a 35-liter capacity, making it the ideal work bag or carry-on. Not to mention the two zippered pockets and welded seams that further aid in waterproofing. How It Feels: Earth Pak has built this roll top backpack with comfort in mind. The back panel is ultra-breathable and soft to wear, thanks to the EVA foam. There are also D-ring attachment points for any gear you’re toting along. But the real kicker is the padded straps with a curved design to match the wearer’s body. No more rubbing, tugging, or constant readjusting, this backpack is designed to stay in place without feeling like anything is there. Flaws But Not Dealbreakers: The only flaw in this backpack is there’s no laptop sleeve. That said, it’s still among the best options for outdoor commuters, namely bikers, who need a waterproof bag to get them from home to the office, regardless of the weather. Material: 500D PVC | Dimensions: 9 x 14 x 19 in | Colors: 5 | Capacity: 35L, 55L, 85L Best for a Laptop: Timbuk2 Tuck Pack Roll Top Backpack Why It’s Great: While Timbuk2 is known for its men’s messenger bags, this is among the best roll top bag for men. It’s the perfect size to fit a 15-inch laptop (with a dedicated sleeve), work essentials, and more, all in a water-resistant shell. The best feature of this bag is the internal organization, with pen holders and other small pockets to ensure nothing gets lost in the abyss. There’s also an external zippered pocket and dual water bottle holders on either side of the bag. How It Feels: This backpack will support any excursion, whether it’s to the office or somewhere farther. It has a lightweight construction with padded shoulder straps, which ensure that you’re not bogged down, even with a fully packed bag. Flaws But Not Dealbreakers: While there’s a lot to love about this backpack, it doesn’t have a sternum strap or hip belt, which may impede comfort while carrying a heavy load. Material: Recycled nylon and polyester | Dimensions: 17.9 x 10.4 x 5.51 in | Colors: 4 | Capacity: 20L rolled, 26L unrolled Best Tactical: 5.11 Eldo RT Pack Why It’s Great: By nature, most roll top backpacks are distinctly tactical. This option from 5.11 leans into the brand’s functional focus, with nylon and polyester, along with enough pockets for all the goods. We’re also fond of the bungee cords to lash gear down, the laptop sleeve, and grab handles on the top of the bag. An element that makes this backpack unique is its zippered closure that’s then rolled and clipped into place for an added layer of security. How It Feels: This roll top backpack feels more like it’s for hiking than the office. However, the resilient and versatile nature makes it ideal for longer commutes or weekends away, mainly thanks to the padded back panel, adjustable shoulder straps, and the sternum clip to keep you comfortable no matter where your adventures lead. Flaws But Not Dealbreakers: This 5.11 backpack only comes in one colorway only, which may deter some who want more variation. Material: Nylon and polyester | Dimensions: 19.75 x 11.5 in | Colors: 1 | Capacity: 30L Best Luxury: Harber London Leather Roll Top Backpack Why It’s Great: While most roll top backpacks are made from tactical materials, this option from Harber London is full-grain leather with a silver buckle and plenty of bells and whistles. In addition to the roll top, the bag features a zippered closure to keep valuables safely secured while keeping the elements out. The main compartment is large enough for a 13-16” laptop (yes, there’s a padded pocket for it), in addition to a smaller zippered compartment on the front of the bag for quick access. If there was ever a perfect work bag, this is it. How It Feels: The soft full-grain leather and silver hardware are extra durable while remaining supple and soft on the eyes. This roll-top bag is great for commuting, but the leather backpack straps may be less comfortable than a padded alternative. Because of this, we’re extra grateful for the grab handle on the top of the bag. Flaws But Not Dealbreakers: This is definitely among the priciest roll-top backpacks out there. However, if you’re looking to save about $400, a similar bag also comes in a Recycled Plastic Bottles Fabric. Material: Premium full grain leather | Dimensions: 15 x 11 x 5 in | Colors: 3 | Capacity: 15-18L ospreypacks / Instagram Buying Considerations for the Best Roll Top Backpacks Size and Capacity Size and capacity are primary considerations for the best roll top packs because this determines how much you’ll be able to fit in it. This is typically expressed in liters, ranging from twelve to forty liters – anything larger than forty liters is generally considered a travel bag, and bags smaller than twelve liters don’t hold much. In my experience, twenty-five liters is the sweet spot, especially for work backpacks. They’re typically large enough for a laptop, office essentials, an extra layer, and a water bottle. Though, if you need some extra room, opt for a thirty-liter backpack, which will hold a bit more. Bags around the twelve to fifteen-liter mark make for optimal daypacks if you’re hitting the trail or headed out for a Saturday adventure. Material The material determines the durability and overall look and feel of a backpack. What makes roll top backpacks unique is that many of them are made from waterproof materials, or at the very least, materials that have been treated with a water-resistant coating. Coupled with the roll top closure, these backpacks are impenetrable by the elements and a smart choice for wet commutes or rugged trips. Some common materials for roll top backpacks include canvas, nylon, ripstop fabrics, and occasionally leather. It’s important to choose a material that makes sense for your intended uses, as this will contribute to the appearance and longevity of your bag. Organization Finally, it’s worth considering the organization features of roll top backpacks; otherwise, you risk falling into the black hole trap. Without extra pockets, everything gets lumped into the main compartment of the backpack, making it impossible to find what you need. At the very least, the best roll top backpacks will have some sort of internal or external pocket for smaller items and, often, laptop storage, pen sleeves, and water bottle holders. If you’re looking for a work bag, these organization features are even more important to consider. giuseppe_la_spina / Instagram Why You Should Trust Us Let me preface this by saying I probably own more backpacks than anyone you’ve ever met. As a full-time traveler, they’re something I’m passionate about and constantly on the lookout for. My collection is extensive, with well over fifty backpacks, ranging from technical hiking packs to everyday carries, purchased at a range of retailers throughout the globe. Aside from my personal passion for backpacks, I have a keen eye for spotting what people are rocking, so many of the roll top backpacks on this list I’ve personally seen sported in cities around the world. If you’re going to take backpack advice from anyone, let my experience steer you in the right direction. Final Verdict At the end of the day, the best men’s roll top backpack combines function, style, and practicality. It also depends on the intended uses since roll top backpacks come in all shapes, sizes, and materials. Our ultimate winner is the Osprey Transporter Roll Top Backpack, which is one of the most versatile backpacks on this list and a comfortable size for a work and weekend bag. FAQ A roll top backpack is locked by rolling down the top portion of the bag and securing it with either a clip in the middle or dual clips on the sides. Some roll top backpacks lock with a standard pinch clip, while others utilize a hook and loop closure. The purpose of a roll top backpack is to keep belongings safe and dry thanks to the special closure that’s designed to keep the elements out. This type of bag is also made to give users slightly more room than a zippered backpack because the extra material on top can expand to fit additional items before being rolled shut.

Without extra pockets, everything gets lumped into the main compartment of the backpack, making it impossible to find what you need. At the very least, the best roll top backpacks will have some sort of internal or external pocket for smaller items and, often, laptop storage, pen sleeves, and water bottle holders. If you’re looking for a work bag, these organization features are even more important to consider. giuseppe_la_spina / Instagram Why You Should Trust Us Let me preface this by saying I probably own more backpacks than anyone you’ve ever met. As a full-time traveler, they’re something I’m passionate about and constantly on the lookout for. My collection is extensive, with well over fifty backpacks, ranging from technical hiking packs to everyday carries, purchased at a range of retailers throughout the globe. Aside from my personal passion for backpacks, I have a keen eye for spotting what people are rocking, so many of the roll top backpacks on this list I’ve personally seen sported in cities around the world. If you’re going to take backpack advice from anyone, let my experience steer you in the right direction. Final Verdict At the end of the day, the best men’s roll top backpack combines function, style, and practicality. It also depends on the intended uses since roll top backpacks come in all shapes, sizes, and materials. Our ultimate winner is the Osprey Transporter Roll Top Backpack, which is one of the most versatile backpacks on this list and a comfortable size for a work and weekend bag. FAQ A roll top backpack is locked by rolling down the top portion of the bag and securing it with either a clip in the middle or dual clips on the sides. Some roll top backpacks lock with a standard pinch clip, while others utilize a hook and loop closure. The purpose of a roll top backpack is to keep belongings safe and dry thanks to the special closure that’s designed to keep the elements out. This type of bag is also made to give users slightly more room than a zippered backpack because the extra material on top can expand to fit additional items before being rolled shut.

The brand has perfected the art of the ideal backpack, and this roll top option lives up to the company’s stellar reputation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike Osprey’s usual offerings, the Transporter is less hiking and more commuting, with a roomy main compartment, top grab handle, and my personal favorite feature, the external 16-inch laptop sleeve. This backpack makes airport security a breeze, and the water-resistant shell can withstand pretty much anything Mother Nature throws its way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow It Feels: \u003c/b\u003eOsprey has mastered the art of a comfortable backpack, and the Transporter is no exception.

This is typically expressed in liters, ranging from twelve to forty liters – anything larger than forty liters is generally considered a travel bag, and bags smaller than twelve liters don’t hold much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my experience, twenty-five liters is the sweet spot, especially for work backpacks. They’re typically large enough for a laptop, office essentials, an extra layer, and a water bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough, if you need some extra room, opt for a thirty-liter backpack, which will hold a bit more. Bags around the twelve to fifteen-liter mark make for optimal daypacks if you’re hitting the trail or headed out for a Saturday adventure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaterial\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe material determines the durability and overall look and feel of a backpack. What makes roll top backpacks unique is that many of them are made from waterproof materials, or at the very least, materials that have been treated with a water-resistant coating. Coupled with the roll top closure, these backpacks are impenetrable by the elements and a smart choice for wet commutes or rugged trips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome common materials for roll top backpacks include canvas, nylon, ripstop fabrics, and occasionally leather. It’s important to choose a material that makes sense for your intended uses, as this will contribute to the appearance and longevity of your bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOrganization\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, it’s worth considering the organization features of roll top backpacks; otherwise, you risk falling into the black hole trap. Without extra pockets, everything gets lumped into the main compartment of the backpack, making it impossible to find what you need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the very least, the best roll top backpacks will have some sort of internal or external pocket for smaller items and, often, laptop storage, pen sleeves, and water bottle holders. If you’re looking for a work bag, these organization features are even more important to consider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1139102\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1139102\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/giuseppe_la_spina_mancarryingtwobackpackbyrains.jpg\" alt=\"man carrying two backpacks by rains\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1800\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/giuseppe_la_spina_mancarryingtwobackpackbyrains.jpg 1440w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/giuseppe_la_spina_mancarryingtwobackpackbyrains-150x188.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/giuseppe_la_spina_mancarryingtwobackpackbyrains-320x400.jpg 320w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/giuseppe_la_spina_mancarryingtwobackpackbyrains-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/giuseppe_la_spina_mancarryingtwobackpackbyrains-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/giuseppe_la_spina_mancarryingtwobackpackbyrains-360x450.jpg 360w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/giuseppe_la_spina_mancarryingtwobackpackbyrains-300x375.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/giuseppe_la_spina_mancarryingtwobackpackbyrains-696x870.jpg 696w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/giuseppe_la_spina_mancarryingtwobackpackbyrains-1068x1335.jpg 1068w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1139102\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CxsREqCNgS3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-lasso-id=\"1270271\"\u003egiuseppe_la_spina\u003c/a\u003e / Instagram\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"trust-us\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy You Should Trust Us\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet me preface this by saying I probably own more backpacks than anyone you’ve ever met.

The brand has perfected the art of the ideal backpack, and this roll top option lives up to the company’s stellar reputation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike Osprey’s usual offerings, the Transporter is less hiking and more commuting, with a roomy main compartment, top grab handle, and my personal favorite feature, the external 16-inch laptop sleeve. This backpack makes airport security a breeze, and the water-resistant shell can withstand pretty much anything Mother Nature throws its way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow It Feels: \u003c/b\u003eOsprey has mastered the art of a comfortable backpack, and the Transporter is no exception. You can wear this bad boy all day without wanting to rip it off. There’s a sternum strap and a low-profile hip belt to help distribute the load. Not to mention the breathable back panel and lightweight design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eFlaws But Not Dealbreakers: \u003c/b\u003eIt’s hard to fault this backpack for anything.

This is typically expressed in liters, ranging from twelve to forty liters – anything larger than forty liters is generally considered a travel bag, and bags smaller than twelve liters don’t hold much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my experience, twenty-five liters is the sweet spot, especially for work backpacks. They’re typically large enough for a laptop, office essentials, an extra layer, and a water bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough, if you need some extra room, opt for a thirty-liter backpack, which will hold a bit more. Bags around the twelve to fifteen-liter mark make for optimal daypacks if you’re hitting the trail or headed out for a Saturday adventure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaterial\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe material determines the durability and overall look and feel of a backpack. What makes roll top backpacks unique is that many of them are made from waterproof materials, or at the very least, materials that have been treated with a water-resistant coating. Coupled with the roll top closure, these backpacks are impenetrable by the elements and a smart choice for wet commutes or rugged trips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome common materials for roll top backpacks include canvas, nylon, ripstop fabrics, and occasionally leather. It’s important to choose a material that makes sense for your intended uses, as this will contribute to the appearance and longevity of your bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOrganization\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, it’s worth considering the organization features of roll top backpacks; otherwise, you risk falling into the black hole trap. Without extra pockets, everything gets lumped into the main compartment of the backpack, making it impossible to find what you need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the very least, the best roll top backpacks will have some sort of internal or external pocket for smaller items and, often, laptop storage, pen sleeves, and water bottle holders. If you’re looking for a work bag, these organization features are even more important to consider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1139102\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1139102\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/giuseppe_la_spina_mancarryingtwobackpackbyrains.jpg\" alt=\"man carrying two backpacks by rains\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1800\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/giuseppe_la_spina_mancarryingtwobackpackbyrains.jpg 1440w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/giuseppe_la_spina_mancarryingtwobackpackbyrains-150x188.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/giuseppe_la_spina_mancarryingtwobackpackbyrains-320x400.jpg 320w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/giuseppe_la_spina_mancarryingtwobackpackbyrains-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/giuseppe_la_spina_mancarryingtwobackpackbyrains-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/giuseppe_la_spina_mancarryingtwobackpackbyrains-360x450.jpg 360w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/giuseppe_la_spina_mancarryingtwobackpackbyrains-300x375.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/giuseppe_la_spina_mancarryingtwobackpackbyrains-696x870.jpg 696w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/giuseppe_la_spina_mancarryingtwobackpackbyrains-1068x1335.jpg 1068w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1139102\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CxsREqCNgS3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-lasso-id=\"1270271\"\u003egiuseppe_la_spina\u003c/a\u003e / Instagram\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"trust-us\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy You Should Trust Us\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet me preface this by saying I probably own more backpacks than anyone you’ve ever met.
