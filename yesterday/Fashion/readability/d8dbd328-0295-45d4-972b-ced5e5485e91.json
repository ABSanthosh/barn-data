If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. This holiday season, we’ve found the gifts that feel great to get and even better to give. Shop Well-Received, our collection of editor-approved holiday gift guides, here.Whether you’re buying fashion presents for your entire extended family or just your nearest and dearest, you likely have a holiday shopping budget. Keeping that in mind, we sourced style-minded gifts for every price range. From a $30 bag charm (a major trend this year!) to $350+ silk sleepwear, these gift ideas will delight any fashion-loving recipient, regardless of the number on the tag. We’ve included a range of coveted accessories (see: trendy sneakers and statement jewelry) and winter clothing (including oversized scarves and some of the season’s most exciting designer collaborations), plus, unexpected and super-aesthetic homeware (like coffee table books and quirky vases).So, whether you’re looking for under-$50 finds for friends and coworkers or are ready to splurge on a luxury gift for that special someone, tick people off your gifting list here.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Fashion Gifts Under $50 If you’ve been searching for luxe gifts that only look expensive, we’ve got you — from Western styles and leopard-printed earmuffs to jelly shoes that hit on 2024’s biggest trend list. Want to elevate your giftee’s everyday accessories and tech? Cart up a bag charm (maybe several for a stacked moment) or a phone case in a trending cow print.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Fashion Gifts Under $150 With a slightly roomier budget, you can snag a pair of ever-popular Adidas Sambas sneakers or a limited-edition Christopher John Rogers x J.Crew hat. You can also explore higher-quality jewelry and premium sweatshirts. For the fashion-obsessed, expand their “Little Book Of” series with a new addition. And, if you want something more tongue-in-cheek for the most in-the-know, consider an heirloom tomato-scented candle that nods to this year’s viral Loewe tomato moment. DashDividers_1_500x100 Fashion Gifts Under $350 An increased price range brings more options worthy of your dollars. Help your giftee explore the must-have barn jacket trend — or, rather than clutching their pearls from being on the receiving end of an underwhelming present, they’ll love a vase that’s cinched with pearls. We’ve also curated accessories like statement belts, leather watches, silk headbands, and furry scarves from fashion insider-approved brands. DashDividers_1_500x100 Fashion Gifts Under $500 For that special someone in your life, there are endless splurge-worthy luxury gift possibilities. Our top picks under $500 include celebrity-approved sunglasses and playful handbags. If a Gucci or Dior bag is out of budget, consider gifting them a perfume or glassware set from their favorite luxury brand instead. For out-of-range men’s watches, a sterling silver bangle is a trendy alternative. Like what you see?
