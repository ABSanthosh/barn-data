Salvador Dalí. Billie Eilish. Aliens. All have inspired costumes worn by the figure skater Madison Chock, who is known not only for intricate twizzles and lifts but also for competing in ensembles that have raised the bar for fashion in her sport. Almost all of her costumes over the last two decades have been designed by Ms. Chock herself.On Saturday, she and her skating partner and husband, Evan Bates, won their second consecutive gold medal for ice dancing at the Grand Prix Final competition in Grenoble, France. For their jazzy free dance routine, Ms. Chock wore a shimmering geometric costume that she said had taken inspiration from the Chrysler Building and other Art Deco architecture.“Figure skating has so much room for fashion,” said Ms. Chock, who often looks to runway shows by high fashion labels like Schiaparelli and Mugler as inspiration for her ensembles. “I am very passionate about design, and I’m in a sport that’s unique because we have an ability to combine creativity with athleticism.”Ice dancing is typically performed in pairs, and unlike figure skating, it does not involve jumping. Instead, top duos like Ms. Chock and Mr. Bates — who are five-time U.S. national champions and Olympic gold medalists — incorporate highly technical footwork patterns and aerial lifts into programs choreographed like ballroom dances.ImageMs. Chock said that deep-sea creatures with exoskeletons were among the references for an alien-inspired costume.Credit...Gabriela Bhaskar/The New York TimesImageThe slime green ensemble Ms. Chock wore for a program to music by Billie Eilish included gloves that were accented with press-on rhinestone nails.Credit...Matthew Stockman/Getty ImagesImageAt last year’s Grand Prix Final, Ms. Chock wore a costume influenced by Salvador Dalí for a program she and Mr. Bates performed to songs by Pink Floyd.Credit...Wang Zhao/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThank you for your patience while we verify access.
