Look out for rich jewel tones in satin or iridescent fabrics. We’re eyeing holiday-appropriate ruffles for extra dimension and drama. Then, throw on a faux-fur shawl, slip into comfortable heels, and swipe on burgundy lipstick to complete your ensemble.Shop EloquiiEloquii Dramatic Ruffle Gown, $, available at EloquiiMichael Costello x Revolve Loren GownShop RevolveMichael Costello x revolve Loren Gown, $, available at RevolveStaud Calluna Iridescent DressShop StaudStaud Calluna Iridescent Dress, $, available at StaudShow Me Your Mumu Greta DressShop Show Me Your MumuShow Me Your Mumu Greta Dress, $, available at Show Me Your MumuHouse of Harlow 1960 x Revolve Astra GownShop RevolveHouse of Harlow 1960 x Revolve Astra Gown, $, available at RevolveCocktail Wedding Guest DressesCocktail attire is one of the most popular special-occasion dress codes. Somewhere in between formal and casual, it allows you (and the party) to move from day to night, and it opens you up to more silhouettes, hemline lengths, and fabrics. For the winter, we recommend midi dresses with delicate lace and mesh trims or elevated bows and pearl embellishments.Shop ReformationReformation Plus Stasia Silk Dress, $, available at ReformationV.

To stay warm and comfortable while looking stylish, seek out long-sleeved, high-neck silhouettes in rich velvets and luxe jersey knits.
