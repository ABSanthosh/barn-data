Known as Le Grand Dîner du Louvre, the gala will celebrate the exhibit titled \"Louvre Couture: Art and Fashion — Statement Pieces\" which explores how items from the Byzantine era to the Second French Empire have influenced designers. The Louvre auctioned more than 30 tables and reportedly achieved its fundraising goal of €1 million for the opening event. {WWD/paywalled}A closer look at recycled goldThe jewelry industry is increasingly using recycled gold, with the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) — aka the world's largest gold trading market — reporting that more than half of its gold comes from recycled sources. The Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC) released guidelines on how to define and verify recycled gold last month, which tightens sourcing requirements as the industry's inability to clearly define what counts as recycled gold has become a hotly debated topic. Proponents of recycled gold say that higher volumes can reduce mining (and thus have a smaller environmental footprint), but skeptics argue increasing dependence on the material could stifle efforts to improve the supply chain and that recycled gold isn't inherently more environmentally friendly. {Vogue Business/paywalled}Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesSsense announces new executive promotionsSsense announced internal promotions within its customer, supply chain and marketing departments on Thursday. The retailer named Christine Sio, who previously served as the brand's vice president of customer experience, as chief customer officer. In her new role, Sio oversees global demand generation, conversion and customer loyalty. After working as Ssense's vice president of global fulfillment operations, Melissa Malik is now the brand's chief supply chain officer where she oversees distribution and fulfillment operations, logistics, supplier management as well as product and process ownership. Marketing strategist Haein Dorin was promoted to global head of marketing at Ssense after working as the global head of partnerships where she built collaborations with TikTok, Volvo and Samsung. {Fashionista inbox}Richemont sales are upRichemont sales grew 10% during the holiday shopping season, with signs pointing to the luxury industry recovering from its downturn. This number is far better than anticipated, as analysts had expected Richemont's sales to gain less than 1%. The Americas and Europe were top performers as expensive jewelry sales offset sluggish watch sales. Richemont's performance in the Asia Pacific region was also much better than estimates, but China remained a weak spot, with sales dropping 18% in the quarter. {Business of Fashion/paywalled}Lanvin Group appoints new executive presidentLanvin Group has appointed Andy Lew, previously CEO of St. John Knits, as the company's executive president. Eric Chan will transition from his role as Lanvin Group's CEO to join the board as a director. With more than 35 years of experience in the fashion industry, Lew will now oversee Lanvin Group's operations, including strategic implementation, business development and growth, financial management, supply chain, information technology and brand operations, according to a press release. Lanvin Group will also establish a second headquarters in Europe, which Lew will lead to support the company's global expansion. {Fashionista inbox}Tune into the Fashionista Network to join the conversation with fashion and beauty industry leaders.
