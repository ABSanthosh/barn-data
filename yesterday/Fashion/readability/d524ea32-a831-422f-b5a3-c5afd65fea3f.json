  "description": "One quick spritz and your makeup will remain perfectly in placeRight, let’s get one thing clear. A mist is not the same as a setting spray. There is a difference. A mist – a good one at least – is great for delivering an extra layer of hydration to your skin before you apply makeup. It’s also great for giving skin a midday refresh – especially useful when, thanks to central heating, the stiff air recirculating in your home or office has sucked the life out of your pores. What a mist won’t do, however, is stop your makeup from disintegrating as the day – or night – goes on. That is the job of a setting spray. A quick spritz of this magical potion provides a protective veil to keep your makeup in place. It is the thing that makes it more resistant to lots of things – sweat, oiliness smudging, creasing – that could potentially derail your makeup after a few hours. It means less need to keep touching up. It also means you won’t see photographs of yourself after the event and wonder what the hell went wrong.1.
