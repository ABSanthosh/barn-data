  "description": "Shopping for jeans can involve a lot of trial and error, especially when you're experimenting with a new silhouette. If you've been tempted to try the polarizing yet inescapable trend of barrel leg jeans, you're not alone. As a shopping editor, I've been obsessively seeking the perfect pair - one that boasts a subtle, flattering shape; feels fresh, but classic enough to have a smidge of longevity. As a Madewell denim fan (the brand's Emmett Patch-Pocket Wide-Leg Jeans are my favorite), I was thrilled to see that the label released its own interpretation of a barrel leg cut. Madewell's Darted Barrel Leg Jeans ($148) are the pair I landed on and have been wearing non-stop. What I Love About Madewell's Darted Barrel Leg Jeans These jeans have a fitted waist, bow out around the middle of the leg, and have a tapered ankle. While there's enough mid-leg volume to capture the barrel leg look, it isn't as exaggerated as Free People's version, or a lot of others on the market. To help emphasize the curved leg shape, this pair has darts at the knees to create a sort of optical illusion, instead of tacking on more volume. The result is subtle and surprisingly flattering. These jeans don't have any stretch, but they're ridiculously comfortable. They sit low at the waist and sort of dangle - the legs are structured but not stiff. I love that they feel like a baggy pair of jeans but have enough structure to still look polished. They also have a cropped ankle, so they don't overwhelm my frame, and look great with everything from ballet flats to sneakers. What's Worth Noting About Madewell's Darted Barrel Leg Jeans These jeans are definitely oversize, so finding the right size can be tricky. I would suggest going one or two sizes down from your normal size. I'm usually a size 28 in Madewell jeans and am wearing a size 27, but I think I could have gotten away with a size 26 since they sit low on the waist. They also have a button fly instead of a zip fly, which is a bit of a pain when putting them on and taking them off. Who Are Madewell's Darted Barrel Leg Jeans Best For? These jeans are perfect for anyone looking to test the barrel leg jean waters. If you're ambivalent about the cut, these are a great entryway pair to experimenting with the trend. Since the cut is fairly subtle, they also feel a bit more classic than more exaggerated silhouettes. Additional Details About Madewell's Darted Barrel Leg Jeans 26.5\" inseam; 16\" leg opening; 10.75\" front rise; 13.5\" back rise (size 25) Button fly Five-pocket style 100 percent cotton Machine wash, tumble dry Where Are Madewell's Darted Barrel Leg Jeans Available? These jeans are available at Nordstrom with limited sizes in the Dobbins wash and more sizes in the Driftwood Brown color, and at Madewell.
