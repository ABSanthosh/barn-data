The Question Is Why.A generational debate has started over Gen Z’s tendency to respond to various social situations with a long and intentional stare.Among the people discussing the Gen Z stare on TikTok are Valerie Jefferson, Efe Ahworegba and Lanie Beams.Credit...Valerie Jefferson, Efe Ahworegba, Lanie BeamsJuly 14, 2025Updated 7:33 p.m. ETWhen Valerie Jefferson, 23, posted a video about the “Gen Z stare” on TikTok, she did not expect it to start a fight.

In the video, Ms. Despot said she greeted the instructor and thanked her for agreeing to teach her daughter how to play golf. In response, she said she was met with a stare and a “yeah.”“I was just confused after the interaction,” she said. “I did some self-reflection and I was like, ‘Did I do something wrong? Did I not read the social situation right?’”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
