My grandmother, she was an influential Navajo potter, and she made our family name.”Gallery guests around him sipped cans of Pacifico as they studied ethereal oil paintings of Monument Valley and Shiprock. Others thumbed through a rack of T-shirts printed with artwork of bald eagles and mesa sunsets. A tattooed server wended through the crowd offering cups of Navajo tea.Mr. Tso grew reflective.“I think Native American people get looked at through a lens of nostalgia, and the contemporary versions of ourselves aren’t seen,” he said. “That’s also been true for Native American art. I think Native pottery could have a huge opportunity to participate in the New York art world if it got the chance, and that’s why I’m glad to be here tonight.”VideoJared Tso, a Navajo ceramist, sculpted pots at the event.CreditCredit...Mr. Tso, who lives in Navajo Nation, a reservation in the southwest, had flown to New York for the downtown gallery event, which celebrated the launch of Hosh, a Native American lifestyle brand that seeks to support contemporary Native artists by adapting their weaving, metal work, pottery and painting into fashion and art.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
