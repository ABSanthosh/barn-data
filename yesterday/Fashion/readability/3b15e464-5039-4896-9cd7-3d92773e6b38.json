Guys with powerful legs who don’t want to size up just to squeeze in. Whether you’re running errands or lounging post-leg day, these shorts give your quads breathing room and still manage to look polished. Flaws but not deal-breakers: The fit is generous by design, which might feel slightly too relaxed if you’re used to slimmer silhouettes. Also, the faux fly might be a no-go for purists who prefer full detailing. Material: 85% Nylon, 15% Spandex | Sizes Available: 28–44 | Inseams: 8 ¼”, 10″ | Care: Machine wash cold, hang dry or tumble dry low | Colors Available: Multiple Best Chino-Style: Mugsy Chino Shorts Why they’re great: Mugsy is known for its stretch-fabric jeans that don’t look like sweatpants. The Chino Shorts are also one of the most comfortable pairs of shorts around. These chinos are made from a cotton, rayon, and spandex blend, giving them four-way stretch. They’re flexible enough to give you ample freedom of movement, and the stylish seven- and nine-inch inseam make them versatile to pair with any shirt or sneaker.

They’re great for guys who want to have chinos as part of their staple look. Flaws but not deal-breakers: You might need to order a size shorter, as they tend to run a little large.

Priced a little under $25, they sport a relaxed fit through the hip, thigh, and leg. The tightly woven summer-weight cotton twill provides ample softness and breathability, making them perfect to wear on warm days. The classic pull-on build doesn’t have stretchy material, so they’ll retain their original form even when worn daily. The elasticated drawcord waist provides you enough room to make adjustments in case they’re too tight or loose. Who are these for? These are simply a great pair of simple, cozy shorts that can be worn in just about any setting and among the best shorts for guys with thick thighs to get. Flaws but not deal-breakers: Some guys might not like the external drawstring design.

Designed with a high-quality cotton and spandex blend, these stretchy bottoms are built tough but are also comfortably lightweight. The brand’s seven-inch inseam balances fit, style, and mobility. They’re equipped with belt loops, so you can add some more flair to your image. Just keep in mind that the loops run a little thin, so large, thick sashes won’t fit. The leg openings are also roomy enough that they won’t hug your legs too tight. Who are these for? These are great casual shorts, perfect for guys who want simple and cozy designs. Also, if you typically wear gym shorts but don’t want to look like a bum, then these will give you a similar feel. Flaws but not deal-breakers: These are among the best shorts for guys with thick thighs. Know, though, that there’s a large, noticeable brand logo on top of the back pocket. It’s not everyone’s vibe. Material: 97% Cotton, 3% Spandex | Sizes Available: XS–3XL | Inseam: 7 inch | Care: Hand wash | Colors Available: 7 Best Everyday: Chubbies The Khakinators Why they’re great: The Khakinators by Chubbies take stylish shorts to the next level with their stretchable fabric. Built with a cotton-spandex blend, these khaki shorts move with you to the point that you can still kick around while wearing them. If you go for the five-inch inseam, you can even do squats, and they won’t tear. The Chambray-lined front pockets are deep enough for your wallet, and the back pocket can snugly fit any smartphone. The elastic waistband ensures that they’ll fit nicely around your waist with or without a belt. They come in 24 colors and print designs, so they can match any outfits you have. All of that adds up to some of the best shorts for guys with thick thighs. Who are these for? If you love showing off your thighs, then these are for you, as they have a pretty short build. Flaws but not deal-breakers: The sizes run bigger than advertised, so it’s probably best to go down a size—depending on your muscle mass, of course. Material: 98% Cotton, 2% Spandex | Sizes Available: XS–3XL | Inseams: 4 inch, 5.5 inch, 7 inch | Care: Machine wash | Colors Available: 24 Best Dress: Bonobos The Chinos Short 2.0 Why they’re great: Crafted with a touch of sophistication, the Bonobos’ The Chino Short 2.0 takes their bestselling pants and cuts them in half to polished casual wear. The four-way stretch fabric makes them ultra-flexible to wear. Their signature curved waistband adds a modern finish and upscales your overall look, even when pairing them with simple crewnecks. The tight, minimalist pockets conjure the elegance of dress pants, and their moisture-wicking properties ensure that you can wear them all day long. The shorts’ thick fabric provides ample durability and wrinkle resistance, so you won’t need to iron them often. Who are these for? These are an excellent choice for men who want a more suitable pair of shorts to take to their neighbor’s barbecue parties or happy hour.

Material: 92% Cotton, 8% Spandex | Sizes Available: XS–XXL | Inseam: 5 inch, 7 inch, 9 inch | Care: Machine wash | Colors Available: 13 Best Swim Trunks: Chubbies The Thigh-napples Why they’re great: The Chubbies Thigh-napples (weird name, I get it, OK?) not only look great but they’re also jam-packed with functionality. These swimming trunks have ultra-stretch and quick-drying properties. They have an elastic waistband and a built-in drawstring, so you’ll stay tight around the waist. The soft mesh line keeps you breezy and comfortable through the crotch, and the two side pockets provide extra drainage when you come out of the water. If you need to keep your valuables safe, there’s a zipper back pocket that you can store them in. Finally, great swimwear should sport unique and funky designs, and you have more than 40 color and print options to choose from. Who are these for? If you’re a dude who has some personality and wants to showcase your thighs on the beach, then cop these immediately. They’re some of the best shorts for men with big thighs you can get. Flaws but not deal-breakers: The drawstrings are sewn into the waistline, and customers have noted that there may be times when one side appears longer than the other. Material: 92% Polyester, 8% Spandex | Sizes Available: XS–3XL | Inseam: 4 inch, 5.5 inch, 7 inch | Care: Machine wash | Colors Available: 40+ Best Luxury: Theory Curtis Drawstring Short Why they’re great: Combining cozy stretch material with a luxurious minimalist aesthetic is The 7″ Curtis Shorts by Theory. Woven from breathable, stretchy linen, this lightweight pair of shorts has a unique functionality that makes them versatile to wear for any casual occasion. The brand’s signature hidden elastic waistband provides ease of movement while remaining inconspicuous. You won’t deal with unsightly strings just to make waistline adjustments. The internal fastening system makes it all but impossible for the trousers to accidentally slip. These luxury shorts come in three normal colors and seasonal limited-edition variants. There is also a nine-inch length option, which adds more versatility in terms of personal style and preference. These are definitely some of the best mens shorts for big thighs. Who are these for? If you have extra room in your budget to spend on an elevated look, then these are for you. To back it up, the brand offers one year of complimentary repair and care services. Flaws but not deal-breakers: On the flip side, at more than $100, they’re decently expensive for a pair of shorts. Material: 62% Linen, 36% Viscose, 2% Elastane | Sizes Available: 28-40 | Inseams: 7 inch (and a 9-inch option) | Care: Dry clean | Colors Available: 3 chubbies / Instagram Buying Considerations For the Best Shorts For Guys with Thick Thighs Style Getting the best shorts for guys with thick thighs depends on your style. If you want to appear somewhat professional despite wearing shorts, then try khakis or chinos. They appear sophisticated compared to athletic shorts, but they’re still comfortable. Printed designs or styles with vibrant colors fit men who are free spirited and laid back. It all boils down to how you want the shorts to match your outfit. Material Some materials are better than others. Shorts made purely from cotton offer ultimate softness, but they’re more prone to wear and tear. Pairs made from polyester, spandex, or elastane are more durable and have high-stretch capabilities, but they don’t look as classy. If you want to maximize comfort, then soft cotton is the way to go, though it may not be as breathable. Prioritizing more features like breathability and moisture wicking will lead you to shorts with mixed-blend synthetic fabric. Size You don’t want to wear shorts that are too tight or too loose. The right size won’t just feel great, but you’ll look put together as well. That’s what you want in the best shorts for men with big thighs. Some styles have elastic waistbands and drawstrings, so they’ll lock into your waist without any problems. There are also brands that add more technical features like an inconspicuous fastener to keep the outward appearance stylish while also securing a snug fit. mugsy / Instagram How We Chose Most brands will claim that their shorts are made with the highest-quality materials available and offer the best features, but that isn’t always the case. All shorts have various properties that work better for different people and situations. Keeping that in mind, I read through customer reviews and product descriptions to find the best shorts for guys with thick thighs that would be ideal for different individuals based on the following factors: Purpose: Will you use the shorts for casual events or lounging? Are you looking for a pair that you can take to the beach? I searched for products that serve the right purpose and avoided recommending those that claim to be the only thing you need. Customer Reviews: Do the customers who actually used the shorts vouch for them? Customer reviews are great indicators of high-quality items when choosing the best ones. Price: You shouldn’t splurge on the most expensive shorts you find if the budget-friendly option serves your needs just right. I balanced quality, features, and price tag when making these suggestions for the best shorts for guys with thick thighs. Why Trust Us?
