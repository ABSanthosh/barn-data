  "description": "There are a lot of cute underwear options out there — mesh, modal, barely-there lace — but when your skin is feeling sensitive, the humidity is at 90%, or you’re just trying to get through the summer day sans swamp, there’s really only one fabric that deserves the crown: cotton. Cotton underwear isn’t just the OG for comfort — it’s better for your body. The fabric is naturally breathable and soft on skin, making it a go-to for anyone prone to irritation or chafing. Unlike synthetics (looking at you, nylon), cotton doesn’t trap heat and, worse, moisture (which can lead to bacteria). That’s a big deal if you’ve ever dealt with discomfort or that not-so-fresh feeling after a long day in tight, non-breathable undies. In short: cotton keeps things cool and dry where it counts. That’s not to say you can’t wear whatever you want — your body, your rules. But if you’re looking to upgrade your underwear drawer this summer, with pieces that check both the cute and practical boxes, this edit is it. Every pick here is made from at least 70% cotton (with most in the 90%-to-100% range), so you’re getting all the benefits of breathability without compromising on style. From no-show thongs and comfy bikinis to cozy briefs, boyshorts, and easy cotton bras, we did the digging to find the softest, cutest, and highly-rated pairs. Cotton Thongs Ideal for no-show days, cotton thongs offer minimal coverage. These styles combine soft fabrics with a stay-put waistband for a comfortable fit that doesn’t dig or shift throughout the day. Cotton Bikini Underwear A reliable everyday option, bikini underwear features a mid-rise waistband and moderate back coverage. The breathable cotton construction helps reduce moisture buildup and irritation, making this a versatile pick for daily wear. Cotton Briefs Designed with a higher rise and full back coverage, briefs are a favorite for their secure fit and all-day comfort. In cotton, they feel soft against the skin and provide breathable support — ideal for those with sensitive skin or anyone seeking more coverage. Cotton Hipster Underwear Hipster cuts sit low on the hips with slightly more coverage than bikinis but less than briefs. These styles are great under mid-rise bottoms and offer comfort with enough stretch to move with you without riding up. Cotton Boyshorts \u0026 Boxers  With a wider leg opening and longer cut, boyshorts and boxers are a comfortable choice. Their smooth, non-binding silhouette helps prevent lines under loose shorts or flowy dresses — or work on their own as loungewear or sleepwear bottoms. Cotton Bras Cotton bras offer lightweight support and a softer, more breathable feel than many synthetic, underwire options. From unlined bralettes to lightly padded styles, these picks prioritize comfort without sacrificing shape or structure. Like what you see?
