  "description": "You need a bit of luck for it to work out perfectly, but there are a few things to try which may helpEven after years of mainlining eyeliner – kohl, gel, liquid, numerous colours – I’d be lying if I said I was an expert. Sometimes I am very happy with how it turns out – a fluke, always a fluke – and other times it goes so horribly wrong I literally have to start over. And if pressed for time – which is usually the case – I forgo the whole thing entirely and hope for a better day. Because perfecting the art of the eyeliner takes skill and dedication. I still have some learning to do. But here’s what I’ve picked up along the way. Pencil liners are generally less work. I literally line between my upper and lower lid with my eyes shut and when I open my eyes, I have the perfect smudgy eyes. Black eyeliner can look austere. Experiment with navy, brown, burgundy, deep greens, aubergines… softer, more fun alternatives. An eyebrow sharpener is a necessity – a stumpy eyeliner never delivers best-in-class results. A dried-out liquid liner is no use to anyone, so keep the lid on. There is a precision required with liquid eyeliner that is rarely nailed the first time around. So if you are a complete novice, save liquid liner for when you’ve gone down the rabbit hole of YouTube tutorials. There is nothing more satisfying than getting the perfect liner. Still, just make sure you always have your cotton buds, dipped in makeup remover, and a lot of patience to hand.1. Victoria Beckham Satin Kajal Liner £32, victoriabeckhambeauty.com 2.
