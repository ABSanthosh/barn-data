His approach includes personalized plans that cover everything from fitness and confidence goals to re-entering the dating scene.Credit...Maggie Shannon for The New York TimesMay 25, 2025When Rachel Lindsay, the star of Season 13 of “The Bachelorette,” and Bryan Abasolo, the contestant she married, finalized their divorce in January, Mr. Abasolo took to Instagram to share the emotional toll of the split. He had been “emotionally and psychologically beaten down,” he said, and offered advice to others navigating similar challenges: “If thinking of separating, find a divorce coach.”In 2023, he began working with Rene Garcia, a divorce and recovery coach based in Miami and Los Angeles, to form “an objective opinion” and gain “guidance” when he was deciding to file for divorce. He and Ms. Lindsay had married in 2019.Mr. Abasolo’s public endorsement of divorce coaching reflects a broader shift in how some couples choose to approach ending their marriage. As divorce rates remain between 40 and 50 percent for first marriages in the United States, and the stigma surrounding divorce lessens, the demand for personalized support in uncoupling is growing.Mr. Garcia, who works with people worldwide and has been in practice since 2021, has supported more than 200 clients in navigating and emotionally recovering from divorce. His services include access to learning modules and videos on well-being and dating, one-on-one coaching sessions as part of a tailored package, and 24-hour availability for urgent assistance, as well as resource support like finding a lawyer or mediator.But Mr. Garcia doesn’t accept everyone who reaches out for a consultation. He only works with male clients who have already decided they want to file for divorce, and he requires that potential clients complete a comprehensive questionnaire to better understand their physical and emotional health.“I turn clients away who I don’t think I’m going to be much of a benefit to,” said Mr. Garcia, whose rates start at $1,600. On average, divorce coaches charge between $50 and $300 per hour, with some, like Mr. Garcia, offering fixed-fee packages. The overall duration and cost of divorce coach services ultimately depend on a client’s needs and stage of the divorce.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
