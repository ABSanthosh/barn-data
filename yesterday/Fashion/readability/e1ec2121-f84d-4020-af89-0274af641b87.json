Some reached for a fork, but the purists held their catch by the tail, tipped their heads back, and lowered the fish right into their mouths.After six long years, the Russ \u0026 Daughters Herring Pairing party was back, this time at the store’s newest location, which opened in Hudson Yards in 2023.“I could eat this herring all day,” said Jerry Richter, 64, who had come in from West Hempstead, Long Island.Mr. Richter, a public-school teacher and veteran of the Herring Pairing party, got hooked on herring “at the tender age of 4” and has been eating herring around the world ever since.But for the moment, nothing could beat New York. “I have been waiting for tonight for too long,” he said.Clockwise from left: Russ \u0026 Daughters special events director Rebecca Zauss, a plate of curried herring, a herring sandwich, and Russ \u0026 Daughters retail manager Julian Bach.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
