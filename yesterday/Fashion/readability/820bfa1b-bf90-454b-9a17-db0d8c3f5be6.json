This winter staple is as essential as your trusty sherpa, faux fur, or classic wool coat. However, too many puffers look cute but barely survive a snowflake. This season, it’s all about jackets that deliver on both warmth and style, such as the sold-out-in-seconds neutral puffer from the Skims x North Face collab, Aritzia’s The Super Puff in a rainbow of colors, and the iconic DKNY long coat (a fail-safe for full-body warmth).But the lineup doesn’t stop at these viral favorites. Levi’s denim puffer is rewriting winter cool. Hollister’s pink puffer might be sold out, but the black is just as cute — and possibly even more versatile. Athleta’s makes transitioning from Pilates to errands seamless, and Khy’s is flying off shelves in every cut and color.This season’s puffers prove that your wardrobe needs more than just one.
