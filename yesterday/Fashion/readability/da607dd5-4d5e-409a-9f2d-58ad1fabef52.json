  "description": "Meghan Markle already has a reputation for incorporating thoughtful design flourishes into her wardrobe; over the years, she's subtly channeled Princess Diana's infamous style, frequently worn pieces from woman-owned brands like Cuyana and Birdies, and even been spotted wearing an eternity ring encrusted with Markle's own birthstone, along with those of her husband, Prince Harry, and their firstborn child, Archie. Now, in her latest Instagram post, the former royal gave fans a glimpse of yet another style that cleverly pays homage to her family - and keeps her kiddos feeling close. ICYMI: Markle took to Instagram earlier in the week to share a video in which she spoke about her ongoing efforts to support the victims of the Altadena wildfire in Los Angeles, as well as thanked Billie Eilish for helping her surprise a 15-year-old fan whose home had been destroyed by the Eaton Fire. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (@meghan) In the video, Markle is wearing what appears to be a simple black sweatshirt with blue jeans and her go-to Cartier watch - aka the perfect off-duty look. But upon further examination, attentive fashion girlies (like myself) noticed a unique detail that sets her top apart from the usual crewneck: embroidered cursive text along the collar that reads \"Archie \u0026 Lili\", the names of Markle's two children. The thoughtful Club Chainstitch Adult Chainstitch Sweatshirt ($73) is not only a sweet nod to Markle's two kiddos, but it also comes from a woman-owned small business in Chicago, Club Chainstitch. The bestselling sweatshirt can be easily customized on the brand's site, giving shoppers the option to choose their text choice, placement, and the letter coloring. Shop the Meghan Markle-approved wardrobe essential below, and for more fashion inspiration from the star, read through our guide of Markle's style evolution.",
