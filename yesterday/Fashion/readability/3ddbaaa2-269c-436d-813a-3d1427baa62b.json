Packed with the glitz and glamour that reflect the essence of the season, there’s nothing quite like bathing yourself in all things sparkly when you want to get in a celebratory mood. Nowadays, sequins aren’t just for special occasions — they’re shoppable in practically every category, from swishy dresses and skirts to dazzling jeans, sweaters and even baseball caps to fulfill all your main-character desires. As always when contemplating a new wardrobe addition, versatility should be top of mind. Luckily, we’ve seen how sequins offer endless styling opportunities for a variety of occasions, from casual outings to the whirlwind of holiday soirées and even the office, when styled right. Even the most extravagant sequinned piece can yield a pretty impressive cost-per-wear.  Whether you prefer a more minimalist daytime approach to sequins, like pairing a bedazzled bodysuit with an oversized suit, or plan to go full Glinda with matching heels and accessories, scroll on to see how five Refinery29 editors are styling them from day to night this holiday season. Tanyel Mustafa, Senior Writer I love midi skirts because they’re so easy to dress up or down — the kind of piece I could wear all day by packing a different top in my bag for an evening swap. Though this sequin number naturally lends itself to nighttime outfits, it also pairs well with oversized T-shirts and trainers for the day. I’d wear this to a gig, festival or on a regular Tuesday when I want to add a touch of glam.  For night I’d let the skirt be the star by pairing it with a black crop top and boots for a work holiday party, a New Year’s gathering, a date night or a fancy bar. Also, sequins are timeless so I can see this lasting throughout the years. Plus, the chocolate brown shade is unique compared to the standard black sequinned dresses we see everywhere this time of year. Esther Newman, Affiliate Writer As a 5ft 2in gal, I’ve always struggled to find the perfect sequin maxi skirt of my mermaid fishtail dreams — they’re always way too long and trailing on the floor (and because of the sequins, difficult to hem). So I’ll settle for a mid-calf-length. Fortunately, I’ve found this nude Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch style, which comes in petite sizing. (There’s a tall alternative, too.) I’m a maximalist at heart so this light, neutral tone is a little out of my comfort zone. But the sequins give it dimension and shine, so I don’t feel washed out. I love how it gleams gold in some lights and is more peachy-pink in others. For the daytime, I’ve leaned into darker tones to let the skirt take centre stage. (This cherry-black knit from Finisterre actually has tiny flecks of multicoloured yarn woven into it, so it lends itself really well to a lighter item.) I then added my trusty biker boots and my latest eBay conquest: a secondhand Mulberry bag. For night, my inspiration was sugar fairy, Barbie mermaid princess, but in a 1950s starlet kind of way. There’s nothing more glamorous to me than sequins and faux fur so I added an old Topshop jacket, plus some more shine with a pink cami, metallic Mary Janes and a beaded bag to complete the vibe. Ebony-Renee Baker, Fashion Editor In my humble opinion, sequins should be worn year-round. Why should we wait until the holiday season to shine like the diamonds we are?! I’ve owned sequinned dresses, skirts and suits but never a bodysuit, so I’m loving the versatility of this Ba\u0026sh one. For a daytime office look, I went for a ‘90s power-suit vibe, pairing my sequins with oversized separates and Air Maxes for comfort.  To transform the bodysuit for a nighttime look, I switched out the trousers for equally sparkly jeans, skinny heeled boots and a faux fur coat for warmth (and a different flavour of glamour). That said, you don’t have to do much to dress up sequins — I’d also pair this with a black midi skirt or wide-leg trousers for a holiday party or fancy dinner.  Humeara Mohamed, Contributing Writer I’m a jeans fanatic — I own way too many pairs. So, naturally, when I saw these, I knew I had to have them. What’s not to love about funky denim that you can wear for all occasions?! For daytime, I opted for a blue shirt (vintage YSL from VOUT) with loafers — the result is slightly more tailored, but still dressy. Come night, I swapped my shoes for heels, the shirt for an old black camisole, and topped it off with a blazer. The pièces de résistance? Chunky earrings, heavy eye makeup and a little black bag. Also, since low-waisted jeans aren’t my usual fit, I sized up and paired them with a belt. Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion Writer I was eager to style my favorite large-sequin mini skirt for the day, pairing it with an oversized grey sweater and metallic sneakers to complement the silver embellishments. I also threw on a metallic tote bag and added a pair of bright red socks for a pop of color that felt festive. I wore this out for flea market shopping, and felt comfortable (and not too dressed up). For night, I recreated what I wore for my last disco-themed birthday party: the same sequin mini skirt with a black ruched, sheer-sleeved bodysuit that added drama and dimension to the outfit. I accessorized with silver puffy hoops and a diamond heart-shaped necklace that sparkled like the sequins. I think the chunky metallic heels were the cherry on top (or bottom) and pulled everything together. Like what you see?
