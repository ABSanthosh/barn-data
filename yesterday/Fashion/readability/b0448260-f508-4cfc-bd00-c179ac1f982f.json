If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. This holiday season, we’ve found the gifts that feel great to get and even better to give. Shop Well-Received, our collection of editor-approved holiday gift guides, here.Whether you’re buying fashion presents for your entire extended family or just your nearest and dearest, you likely have a holiday shopping budget. Keeping that in mind, we sourced style-minded gifts for every price range. From a $30 bag charm (a major trend this year!) to $300+ silk sleepwear, these gift ideas will delight any fashion-loving recipient regardless of the number on the tag. We’ve included a range of coveted accessories (see: trendy sneakers and statement earrings) and winter clothing (including some of the season’s most exciting designer collaborations). Plus, unexpected and super-aesthetic homeware (like coffee table books and quirky vases).So whether you’re looking for under-$50 gifts for friends and coworkers or ready to splurge on a luxury gift for that special someone, start shopping and ticking people off your gifting list here. DashDividers_1_500x100 Fashion Gifts Under $50 If you’ve been searching for luxe gifts that only look expensive, we’ve got you. From statement earrings and jelly shoes that hit on 2024’s biggest trend list to stylish home goods. Think: printed cups from Farm Rio’s newly-launched homeware and Tecovas cowboy boot ornaments made from the brand’s iconic luxe leathers. To elevate your giftee’s everyday accessories and tech? Cart up a bag charm (maybe several for a stacked moment) or a phone case in a trendy cow print. DashDividers_1_500x100 Fashion Gifts Under $150 With a slightly roomier budget (yes, we found top-notch under-$100 finds, too), you can snag a pair of ever-popular Adidas Sambas sneakers or a limited-edition Christopher John Rogers x J.Crew hat. You can also explore higher-quality jewelry and premium sweatshirts. For the fashion-obsessed, expand their “Little Book Of” series with a new addition. And if you want something more tongue-in-cheek for the most in-the-know, consider an heirloom tomato-scented candle that nods to the viral 2024 Loewe tomato moment.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Fashion Gifts Under $350 With an increased price range comes more product options worthy of your dollars. Help your giftee explore the must-have barn jacket trend or get them feeling cozy in a cute cardigan this winter. And rather than clutch their pearls from being on the receiving end of an underwhelming present, your giftee will love a vase that’s cinched with pearls, instead. We’ve also curated accessories like statement belts, leather watches, silk headbands, and furry scarves from fashion insider-approved brands.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Fashion Gifts Under $500 For that special someone in your life, there are endless possibilities of splurge-worthy luxury gifts. Coming in under $500, our top picks include statement handbags and celebrity-approved sunglasses. But if a Gucci bag is out of budget, consider gifting them a perfume that can also double as home décor. Similarly, for out-of-range watches, a sterling silver bangle is a trendy alternative.  Like what you see?
