These are a great option if you find yourself on the shorter end of the scale as they feature a 0.5” heel, giving you a boost in the height department. And, in case you think these look a bit familiar, the outsole undeniably resembles some pairs from On; the big difference is that you’re saving over half the money.

This ongoing initiative perfectly complements the spirit of giving, letting you step out in style while making a difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the subbrand isn’t just about philanthropy – it’s also about comfortability. The collection has an array of trendy, foot-friendly designs, like faux fur-lined slip-ons and chunky-soled sneakers, all with the enduring quality you can expect from Skechers. Different pairs in this collection include the Sport Squad 4 and Squad Chaos 4, the latter of which features an eco-conscious upper made of vegan leather, Skechers’ signature Heel Pillow for maximum stability when slipping into these hands-free kicks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWant something a little more modern? The BOBS Sport Arc Waves features a sleek jacquard-knit upper and unique cushioned midsole they call the Glide-Step, designed to grant natural momentum with every stride. These are a great option if you find yourself on the shorter end of the scale as they feature a 0.5” heel, giving you a boost in the height department. And, in case you think these look a bit familiar, the outsole undeniably resembles some pairs from On; the big difference is that you’re saving over half the money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re on the market for an everyday sneaker or something more upscale for holiday gatherings, Skechers’ BOBS holiday collection offers something for everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond our furry friends, BOBS has donated millions of pairs to children affected by poverty, homelessness, and natural disasters.
