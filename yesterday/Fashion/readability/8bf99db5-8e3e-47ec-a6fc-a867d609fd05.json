Our critic offers an explanation for its appeal.Elizabeth Taylor, in 1962. Credit...Keystone/Hulton Archive, via Getty ImagesOct. 14, 2024Will we ever see the end of leopard print on women’s clothing? I recently met a friend after work at happy hour, and of about nine women in the area four wore leopard print: jacket, blouse, leggings, handbag. What is the appeal, and where did it even come from? And what is the best way to wear it? — Julianne, Ann Arbor, Mich.Leopard print — indeed, all animal prints, including zebra, python, cow and many not actually found in nature — have been with us since our long-ago ancestors turned the pelts of the animals they killed for food into clothing. Its role as a signifier has changed according to time and context, but it has never really disappeared, even as fur itself has fallen out of favor.

Mrs. Robinson wore leopard. So did Jayne Mansfield — and Sid Vicious. Roberto Cavalli and Dolce \u0026 Gabbana built empires on it. It’s a staple in Las Vegas. It suggests predators, confidence, flamboyance, camp and animal attraction.(On that subject: In 2013 the Chessington World of Adventures in Surrey, England, banned visitors from wearing leopard and tiger print for fear it was confusing the animals, who saw visitors as either prey or potential, um, friends.)If you want to know more, check out the 2018 book, “Fierce: the History of Leopard Print.”Still, there is a fine line between the haute and the highly kitschy when it comes to a leopard print wardrobe, as the star of the 2020 documentary “Tiger King,” the wildly (couldn’t help it) popular Netflix series of the pandemic lockdown, showed.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
