  "description": "There's no doubt about it, Lewis Hamilton is a driving force in the world of fashion. The Formula 1 driver has become almost as famous for his love of bright, bold, and eccentric outfits as he has for his many championship titles, and there's no sign of him putting the brakes on his wardrobe choices anytime soon. With a number of races under his belt this season, Hamilton has regularly been spotted in the paddock wearing an array of looks that put him in first place in the fashion stakes. Notably, he did so before it became a trend among athletes as fashion pages dedicated to driver style like F1 Paddock Fits can attest. The 40-year-old has regularly discussed his personal style, which often includes a mix of emerging, diverse designers and pieces from larger fashion houses. In a previous interview with Vogue, Hamilton said: \"[F]ashion is about freeing yourself - it's about self-expression; it's about you; it's about slowly, over time, evolving and learning more about yourself and what you like and how you want to show up - how you want to be seen. What makes you feel great? It's a great feeling when you put on a piece of clothing and throw your shoulders back and are just like: I feel great today. That's what fashion does.\" Hamilton works with stylist Eric Mcneal; is conscious of the environmental impact of fashion; and is constantly striving to promote more diversity, both within motorsport and the fashion industry. He's cohosting the Met Gala in May 2025 and he's a fitting choice for the theme \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,\" which celebrates the history and enduring impact of Black dandyism. When the famed driver attended the Met Gala in 2021, he used his platform to invite three emerging Black designers to his table (Theophilio, Kenneth Nicholson, and Jason Rembert of Ali√©tte). He was also cast as the star of Valentino's Fall 2022 campaign, modeling Pierpaolo Piccioli pink alongside Zendaya, chosen for his influence beyond the race track. As he makes his bid to bag another championship this year, take a pit stop and scroll ahead for all the times Hamilton has turned the paddock into a runway.",
