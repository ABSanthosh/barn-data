Any products or services put forward appear in no particular order. if you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Rarely does a man ask Santa Claus for a calendar or coffee mug. Yet despite their festive shortcomings, these humdrum heroes sneak into our stockings year after year. Some deem it lazy, but I prefer to give gift-givers the benefit of the doubt—chalking it up to a simple misunderstanding of what a guy really wants for Christmas (or a birthday/anniversary). To help avoid future disappointment, I’ve rounded up 11 stylish gift ideas courtesy of Axel Arigato. From sneakers and socks to jackets and hoodies, keep reading for a selection of sure-fire winners that’ll appeal to men of all style sensibilities. In This ArticleOur PicksFinal Word Billie Fleece Jacket Why it’s great: Fleece season has started, and with outdoorsy attire more popular than ever, there’s no better time to invest. Crafted from a soft, fluffy fabric with nylon paneling, the Billie jacket is bound to bring happiness to anyone you give it to—especially as there’s drawcords at the hem to allow them to customize the profile. Who is this for? Cozy and seriously cool, this fleece is modern workwear at its best. Suitable for cold commutes, weekend walks, and everything in-between, it’ll be a hit with the whole family. Dice Lo Sneakers Why it’s great: The Dice Lo is one of Axel Arigato’s most popular styles thanks to its perfect mash-up of modern and vintage design. This version is handcrafted from leather, suede, and recycled polyester with paneled uppers and subtle branding throughout. Comfortable to wear and easy to style, it’s been given a special treatment that wears off over time to expose the natural base for a worn effect. Who is this for? Whether he’s a sneaker enthusiast always on the hunt for the next cool pair, or someone who values craftsmanship and versatility, these sneakers tick all the boxes. They’re ideal for the guy who wants his wardrobe to work just as well on casual weekends as it does for fancier outings. Washed Signature Cap Why it’s great: From hiding bad hairs days to keeping scalps safe from the sun, the humble hat has many great benefits. It also happens to add an exciting new layer to any outfit—if you choose the right one, of course. A five-star style that’ll put you firmly on the good list, this washed cotton cap comes with the brand’s signature embroidery and an adjustable back strap that ensures a snug fit for any size head. Who is this for? This versatile accessory will appeal to just about any guy, from the explorer type to streetwear aficionados. It’s also one of the more affordable gift options for those on a budget. Arigato Logo Tube Socks Why it’s great: Socks often tread a fine line between “oh no, not again” and “wow, I actually needed these,” but this pair confidently tips the balance in favor of greatness. Forget the boring, basic designs that feel like an afterthought; these are the classy kind that make a statement without trying too hard. Who is this for? Buy these for the man who enjoys the finer details of his fits and a quality, thoughtful gift that gets everyday use. They’re a great stocking filler and perfect if you’re not entirely sure of his style. Dice T-Toe Sneakers Why it’s great: A recent addition to the Axel Arigato portfolio, the Dice T-Toe is a vintage-inspired sneaker that hits the sweet spot between retro and modern. Drawing on the best of two eras, it channels the streamlined aesthetics of ‘70s track shoes with a nod to the laid-back vibe of ‘90s skate culture. With its handcrafted leather, suede, and eco-friendly recycled polyester uppers, it’s the perfect mixture of style and sustainability—guaranteed to put a smile on his face. Who is this for? If he’s the kind of guy who can’t resist a yard sale or spends his lunch break scrolling Vinted for ‘80s Levi’s and Swedish Army jackets, he’ll be all over the retro vibes these sneakers give off. They’re made for the dude who has an eye for the unexpected and loves a good backstory for his wardrobe. City Tote Why it’s great: Forget backpacks and satchels (for now, at least), the tote is the most versatile carry-all on the market. Easy to pack with enough room to accommodate everything a man needs, it’ll take him from grocery runs to beach trips and back again. But I’m not talking about the free gift you received at last week’s tech conference. Rather the sturdier, cooler kind, like this one from Axel Arigato. It’s made from a durable cotton-blend canvas, trimmed with faux leather, and finished with screen-printed branding. It’ll look just as good with a work suit as it will with Friday night’s outfit. Who is this for? A tote bag always comes in handy, but men that have a regular need for carrying around their stuff are going to appreciate this gift the most. Those that work in an office, for example. Or like to spend their weekends at flea markets. Legend Hoodie Why it’s great: Every wardrobe needs a great hoodie, which is why your dearest will be delighted to unwrap this one. Slightly oversized with dropped shoulders and ribbed cuffs, it boasts a zip-up fastening and appliquéd Arigato branding across the front. It’ll be their go-to for relaxed weekends, dress-down Fridays, and long-haul flights. Who is this for? The hoodie isn’t what it used to be. Having got rid of its scruffy image, the casual staple can be worn everywhere and anywhere, making it a must-have gift for fellas of any age or occupation. Clean 90 Sneakers Why it’s great: Axel Arigato’s Clean 90 sneakers are timeless, looking just as good with jeans and a flannel shirt as they do with sweatpants and an oversized tee. Featuring smooth leather uppers and slightly-chunkier-than-average soles, they’re soft in all the right places with decent arch support and cushioned footbeds. Who is this for? Free from unnecessary features and loud logos, these are a minimalists’ dream. They’re also going to appeal to any bloke that wants a versatile sneaker he can wear all the time. Team Polo Sweater Why it’s great: Ever since Jacob Elordi sported a boxy knitted polo on Jimmy Fallon’s The Tonight Show, brands have been making some serious sweater moves. Case in point is this little beauty. Spun from a soft cotton-blend in a relaxed fit, it has a varsity-style logo at the chest and clean tonal buttons. Once he slips it on, don’t be surprised if he suggests going for a few beers so he can show it off. Who is this for? This is the type of present that’ll earn you some serious brownie points, so you better start thinking about your post-gift-giving demands. It’s ideal for the luxury lover and men serious about upgrading their knitwear. Genesis B Bird Runner Sneakers Why it’s great: The good thing about buying sneakers as a gift is you don’t need to know someone’s exact measurements. Just a quick peek at the shoe rack and you have their size. The trouble is finding a pair they’ll like, especially if they’re fussy. The solution is Axel Arigato’s Genesis B Bird Runner. Universally appealing, it’s an uber-versatile style that’s timeless, tough, and oh-so comfy. It debuted in the brand’s 2017 collection and still remains one of its best sellers today. Who is this for? Not just for sneakerheads, these will excite any guy who appreciates clean, versatile footwear. And thanks to the impressive size range (7-14), you’re sure to find his size. Single Bee Bird T-Shirt Why it’s great: There’s nothing quite like a good T-shirt. Whether you’re big on biker style or mad about minimalism, we can all agree that a classic crew neck is one of the most reliable staples a man can own. This one, in a regular fit, is the perfect present. Not only easy to wrap, it’s made from a seriously soft organic cotton with a bee bird chest embroidery for just the right amount of character. It’ll go with everything from jeans and boots to sweatpants and sneakers. Who is this for? If you’re worried about buying the wrong thing, this classic tee is a fail-safe option that any guy will be lucky to receive. It shows you care and understand the importance of quality basics. Final Word Don’t be a bore by buying bourbon and a bath bomb; level up your gifting game with these stylish picks that’ll make you the Secret Santa everyone hopes pulls their name. From killer kicks to cozy hoodies, these Axel Arigatio present ideas will cement your reputation as the gift-giving guru who always nails it.",
