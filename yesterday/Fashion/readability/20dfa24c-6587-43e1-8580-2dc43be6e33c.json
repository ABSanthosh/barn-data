  "description": "We don't know about you, but we're currently in our football era - and it's all thanks to Taylor Swift. Ever since the pop superstar made her surprise appearance at that fateful Sunday Night Football game last year, we've found ourselves hyper-focused on the football season more than ever before. Sure, the games themselves are entertaining - when you've got generational talents (and TikTok-loved players) like Patrick Mahomes and Joe Burrow all in the league, you can bet some pretty high-stakes showdowns will take place. But perhaps even better than who's playing on the field is who's showing up and showing out in the stands - especially when the talent is Ms. Swift herself. The 2024-2025 NFL playoffs are here, with divisional round games set to take place this weekend; the Kansas City Chiefs will face off against the Houston Texans, while the Buffalo Bills will compete against the Baltimore Ravens, the Washington Commanders against the Detroit Lions, and the LA Rams against the Philadelphia Eagles. These playoff games will feature some of the league's most prominent stars, including none other than Swift's boyfriend, three-time Super Bowl-winner and tight end Travis Kelce. And with Swift's attendance for the game seemingly confirmed by Kelce in an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show, NFL fans (and Swifties alike) have even more to get excited about. The musician's presence became a fixture at NFL games last season. From creating touchdown-celebration handshakes with Brittany Mahomes to chatting up Donna Kelce with a vodka cranberry cocktail in hand, Swift appears to be leaning all the way into her WAG era - and inspiring a whole new legion of fans to obsess over the game (or at least tune in to see what she's wearing). Whether you're a dedicated NFL viewer looking to embrace the Swift x NFL crossover or simply a loyal Swiftie hoping to love the sport just as much as the singer, you can conquer the upcoming NFL playoffs in style with these game day outfits - all of which are inspired by Taylor Swift's outfits, no less. From her favorite red lipstick to logo sweaters with \"NFL (Taylor's Version)\" printed across the front and other stylish football outfits that play into this iconic crossover between sports and pop culture, here's what to wear to wear to a football game with a Swiftie-inspired twist.",
