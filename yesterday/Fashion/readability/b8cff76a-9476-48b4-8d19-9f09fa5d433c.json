Additionally, the premium white leather requires regular maintenance to keep the sneakers looking their best. Beat-up white sneakers are definitely a fashion choice, but if you’re looking for long-lasting, fresh-out-of-the-box sneakers, be prepared to spend some time cleaning them.

However, if you can manage to get the cash together, they’ll certainly prove their worth over time. Sizes Available: 5.5-14.5 | Material: 100% Leather Best Everyday: Cariuma Gum Canvas Sneakers Why it’s great: Made from a robust canvas fabric (ensuring they’re tough enough for everyday wear), the OCA Low offers the perfect blend of functionality and style. Particularly suited to relaxed ensembles, they’ll soon become your go-to footwear choice—whether you’re exploring the city or keeping it casual at work. My favorite feature is the 100% vegan insoles that are made from organic mamona oil (a plant-based alternative to petroleum) and cork (which just happens to be extremely comfortable). How to wear it: You’ll want to wear these ones casually, so consider pairing them with staples such as slim-fitting jeans, khakis, and combats. On top, take your pick from crew neck tees, sweaters, and polo shirts. Who is this for? If you like to prioritize comfort and wearability over current trends, Cariuma’s OCA Low is going to tick a lot of boxes. They’re also the kind of sneakers that will look just as good once they’ve taken a bit of a beating. Flaws but not dealbreakers: Canvas can be a little trickier to clean than leather, so you may need to invest in a proper sneaker-cleaning kit should you get them dirty. Sizes Available: 4-12 | Material: 100% Canvas Best Leather: Myrqvist Oaxen II Sneakers Why it’s great: Almost as smart as shoes yet casual enough to offer greater versatility, Myrqvist’s Oaxen II is the ultimate do-it-all sneaker.

The Portuguese leather construction is as good as it gets and the hand stitching further adds to the premium feel. How to wear it: Styling options are aplenty.

For those who want a luxury sneaker that isn’t going to break the bank. They’re also going to be appealing for guys who want a sneaker that is easy to clean. The smooth leather uppers are easy to wipe down. Flaws but not dealbreakers: The leather may need a little breaking in before it feels its most comfortable. Sizes Available: 6.5-12.5 | Material: 100% Leather Staying Ahead Of Trends: Adidas Gazelle Shoes  Why it’s great: Adidas has had some big years recently, and it seems hard to avoid seeing a certain shoe every time you leave the house or open Instagram (cough, cough, Sambas). But I don’t want to be like everyone, and I know you don’t either BUT, finding clothes that make you feel good and feel in trend can be important. Hence, the perfect blend of classic charm, contemporary flair and a little something different than what everyone else has on their feet comes in the form of the Adidas Cloud White Gazelle Shoes. Revered for their sleek, all-white design, these shoes are a testament to Adidas’s enduring legacy in footwear fashion.

This means you can class up a casual dinner outfit or slip them on with a pair of sensible joggers to run the dreaded Saturday morning grocery run. Who is this for? The shoes’ supple leather upper provides a luxurious feel, while the signature Adidas stripes add a touch of classic sportiness. The cushioned sole ensures comfort, and the lace-up design allows for a customizable fit. Whether paired with jeans, shorts, or even smart casual attire, these sneakers elevate any look. Flaws but not dealbreakers: However, they might not be the go-to for intense athletic activities, and their pristine white color requires careful maintenance to keep them looking their best. Sizes Available: 4-14 | Material: Full Grain Leather, Synthetic Leather, Rubber Best High Tops: Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Why it’s great: Few sneaker brands can compete with Converse’s portfolio of famous wearers. From Whiz Khalifa to Kurt Cobain, the label’s carefree classics have found their way onto the feet of some of the world’s most recognizable men. And it’s not just because they look great—they’re durable, versatile, and seriously comfy too. How to wear it: There’s a reason why these are one of the best white sneakers for men. Actually there are numerous reasons. But their ability to pair well with casual and semi-formal attire alike is one of the main ones. For a fail-safe ensemble suitable for most occasions, try them with a knitted cardigan, crew neck tee, and jeans. Who is this for? If classic style is your thing, the Chuck Taylor is going to take pride of place in your sneaker collection. It’s also going to be popular for those looking for the kind of footwear you can throw on with any outfit— whether you’re on a coffee run or heading into the office. Flaws but not dealbreakers: The only flaw I can think of is that you may already own a pair. Adding a spare to your collection or opting for the updated Chuck 70,  is never a bad idea, mind. Sizes Available: 4-13 | Material: 100% Canvas Best Budget: Reebok Club C 85 Sneaker Why it’s great: A true ’80s original, Reebok’s Club C 86 sneakers are inspired by tennis all-stars and I think they’re absolutely ace (pun intended). Boasting a quality leather upper that’s both durable and soft, they’re finished with cushioned midsoles that ensure a smooth landing after every step. The modest price tag leaves you with extra cash to improve the rest of your fit (if required, of course). How to wear it: Ideal for outfits that sit firmly on the smart-casual fence, they can be teamed with everything from sweatpants to jeans and shorts. I feel they look best at the weekend with 90s-inspired denim and a long-sleeved tee. Who is this for? With its retro design and timeless appeal, this sneaker is going to be universally appealing—especially for those who are old enough to remember its release the first time around. You’ll also love it if you’re in on the cultural phenomenon that is ‘dad style’. Flaws but not dealbreakers: Some wearers believe they run a little narrow—making them potentially a little uncomfortable for extra wide feet. Sizes Available: 3.5-15 | Material: 100% Leather Best on Amazon: Adidas Stan Smith Sneakers Why it’s great: They don’t come much more classic than the Adidas Stan Smith. The iconic sneaker was first released in 1965 and has remained virtually unchanged since—proving whatever they’re doing is definitely working. Comfortable, versatile, and effortlessly stylish, you’ll be wearing them to dates, dinners, and drinks at the bar. How to wear it: The great thing about the Stan Smith is you can wear it pretty much anywhere. It’ll look clean teamed with tailoring, pairs perfectly with sweatpants, and feels right at home with jeans and a crew neck tee. Who’s this for? Fans of adidas sneakers are obviously going to prick up their ears, but these sneakers will appeal to anyone who’s after versatile footwear that can always be relied on. They’ll also prove a hit for men who like their footwear to be low-maintenance. Stan Smiths look just as good once they’ve taken a few hits and scuffs. Flaws but not dealbreakers: Unless you live on Mars, chances are you’re going to be seeing a lot of other guys wearing these. Not ideal if you’re the kind of man who likes to stand out from the crowd. Sizes Available: 5-14 | Material: 100% Leather Best Athletic: New Balance Fresh Foam X 880v13 Why it’s great: If you’re looking for white men’s sneakers that can be used for running as well as long days standing around, look no further. The Fresh Foam X 880v13 from New Balance gives you the perfect blend of style, support, and squishiness. They feature breathable mesh uppers, super comfortable midsoles, and durable rubber outsoles that flex with each step. The bio-based materials are made from renewable resources that help reduce carbon footprint. How to wear it: It goes without saying that you can wear them with your workout gear, but they won’t look out of place should you put them on at the weekend with sweatpants or jeans. Just make sure you’re not planning on going anywhere fancy. Who is this for? Choose these if you’re spending a lot of time on your feet. For example, if you’re planning a weekend exploring your favorite city. They’re also going to prove popular for guys that want a versatile workout sneaker. Flaws but not dealbreakers: They come in four different fits: narrow, normal, wide, and extra wide. And while it’s fantastic there are multiple options to choose from, it’s important to select the right one for your foot shape. This is where it gets tricky; from what I can see, the size guides don’t offer any advice on the differences. Sizes Available: 5-16 | Material: 100% Mesh Best Clean Design: Axel Arigato Clean 90 Sneakers Why it’s great: Cleaner than the hands of an Aesop shop assistant, these Axel Arigato sneakers are the kind that’ll have you forgetting about all the other pairs in your wardrobe. Made from smooth white leather with rubber cup-soles, they’re a highly versatile option that’s easy to wipe down should you encounter any scuffs or spills. How to wear it: Your styling options are endless. You can dress them up with your favorite tailoring or keep it casual with selvedge denim and a crew neck sweater. In the summer, they’ll look equally as good with swim shorts as they would with khakis or linen pants. Who is this for? Whether you’re a sneakerhead or just a guy who likes decent shoes, you’re going to love these. They’re perfect for men who are willing to pay a little extra for real quality. Flaws but not dealbreakers: At $300 a pair, they’re edging towards the ‘splurge’ category, but are well worth the money if you ask me. Once you take into consideration how many times you’ll wear them, in reality you’re getting an absolute steal. Sizes Available: 7-14.5 | Material: 100% Leather davidcykim / Instagram A Brief History Of Men’s White Sneakers It may have changed the way men dress for good, but the story of how the humble white tennis shoe took over the world and became essential for anything but sport is not one that occurred overnight. Despite relatively new entries to the market from Common Projects (2004), Alexander McQueen (2012), and Tom Ford (2014) — who previously swore he would never make sneakers — the beginnings of the trend can be traced back through menswear for more than 80 years. The original Stan Smiths, worn by the man himself One of the earliest examples of an athletic sneaker to cross over into the mainstream was the white Converse Chuck Taylor, which debuted at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. In the years and decades that followed, crisp white sneakers from brands like Spring Court, Adidas, and Superga found themselves on many a famous foot, Steve McQueen’s included. Fashion types went crazy when, in recent years, Savile Row tailors started styling their suits with white sneakers, but John Lennon was doing it on the cover of Abbey Road back in 1969. Of course, like any other area of menswear, sneaker trends come and go. And though minimalist trainers — typified by models like the Achilles Low and Stan Smith — have reigned supreme since the turn of the millennium, in recent seasons the trend has broadened to include both chunky styles and retro sneakers, rendered in a range of materials from luxury Italian leather to run-of-the-mill mesh. However, they all remain linked by their ability to symbolize off-duty cool in a way few menswear pieces have managed to achieve. Buying Considerations for the Best White Sneakers For Men  Style When it comes to picking a style of white sneakers, consider two things: versatility and occasion. Think about where you’ll be wearing the sneakers most frequently and if they’re suitable for those events. If it’s for casual outings, a sporty design might be best, while formal occasions require something more sleek and refined. Material You should always pay close attention to the materials used to make sneakers. Quality materials not only affect the overall look but also impact durability and comfort. Leather, canvas, and synthetic materials are common for white sneakers. Generally speaking, leather is the best—offering the perfect blend of comfort and durability. Maintenance Before committing to a particular style, it’s a good idea to think about how easy they are to clean should you get them dirty. While there are many cleaning products available for all types of sneakers, some are easier to clean than others. For example, smooth leather sneakers can be easily wiped clean, while textured suede or canvas designs require a more complicated cleaning process. o_____ing / Instagram Why You Should Trust Us Not only am I a self-confessed sneaker addict, I’ve been writing about men’s clothing and shoes for over a decade. During that time, I’ve managed to grasp a deep understanding of what makes a great product. Using this knowledge and some help from online reviewers, I have pulled together eight of the best white men’s sneakers (having started with a list longer than the New York Yankees’ trophy cabinet). Final Verdict And there you have it my fellow footwear fanatics: the best white sneakers for men. Adding a pair to your collection is not just a fashion statement; it’s a shrewd sartorial move that strengthens your options and ensures you always have something to turn to. Axel Arigato’s Clean 90 remains one of my favorite recommendation. Crafted from smooth white leather, they’re a super stylish, versatile option that looks great with everything from jeans and sweaters to casual tailoring and smart-casual shirts. They’ll last, always look fresh (if you look after them), and strike the perfect balance between form and function. FAQ White sneakers are a great option for any man, regardless of his sartorial preference. Versatile and timeless, they effortlessly complement a variety of outfits, from casual to semi-formal, providing a clean and stylish look. It doesn’t matter how old you are—men of all ages can wear white sneakers. You should always wear what you want and feel most comfortable with. Ultimately, the decision to wear socks with white sneakers is subjective and should align with individual style and comfort preferences. Having said that, you should always take the occasion into consideration. For example, when it comes to everyday outfits, wearing socks with jeans is a great idea. However, if you’re on vacation wearing shorts, you should probably go without. Billy is a content specialist and social media manager.

Just make sure you’re not planning on going anywhere fancy. Who is this for? Choose these if you’re spending a lot of time on your feet. For example, if you’re planning a weekend exploring your favorite city. They’re also going to prove popular for guys that want a versatile workout sneaker. Flaws but not dealbreakers: They come in four different fits: narrow, normal, wide, and extra wide. And while it’s fantastic there are multiple options to choose from, it’s important to select the right one for your foot shape. This is where it gets tricky; from what I can see, the size guides don’t offer any advice on the differences.

Sizes Available: 7-14.5 | Material: 100% Leather davidcykim / Instagram A Brief History Of Men’s White Sneakers It may have changed the way men dress for good, but the story of how the humble white tennis shoe took over the world and became essential for anything but sport is not one that occurred overnight. Despite relatively new entries to the market from Common Projects (2004), Alexander McQueen (2012), and Tom Ford (2014) — who previously swore he would never make sneakers — the beginnings of the trend can be traced back through menswear for more than 80 years. The original Stan Smiths, worn by the man himself One of the earliest examples of an athletic sneaker to cross over into the mainstream was the white Converse Chuck Taylor, which debuted at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. In the years and decades that followed, crisp white sneakers from brands like Spring Court, Adidas, and Superga found themselves on many a famous foot, Steve McQueen’s included. Fashion types went crazy when, in recent years, Savile Row tailors started styling their suits with white sneakers, but John Lennon was doing it on the cover of Abbey Road back in 1969. Of course, like any other area of menswear, sneaker trends come and go. And though minimalist trainers — typified by models like the Achilles Low and Stan Smith — have reigned supreme since the turn of the millennium, in recent seasons the trend has broadened to include both chunky styles and retro sneakers, rendered in a range of materials from luxury Italian leather to run-of-the-mill mesh. However, they all remain linked by their ability to symbolize off-duty cool in a way few menswear pieces have managed to achieve. Buying Considerations for the Best White Sneakers For Men  Style When it comes to picking a style of white sneakers, consider two things: versatility and occasion. Think about where you’ll be wearing the sneakers most frequently and if they’re suitable for those events. If it’s for casual outings, a sporty design might be best, while formal occasions require something more sleek and refined. Material You should always pay close attention to the materials used to make sneakers. Quality materials not only affect the overall look but also impact durability and comfort. Leather, canvas, and synthetic materials are common for white sneakers. Generally speaking, leather is the best—offering the perfect blend of comfort and durability. Maintenance Before committing to a particular style, it’s a good idea to think about how easy they are to clean should you get them dirty. While there are many cleaning products available for all types of sneakers, some are easier to clean than others. For example, smooth leather sneakers can be easily wiped clean, while textured suede or canvas designs require a more complicated cleaning process. o_____ing / Instagram Why You Should Trust Us Not only am I a self-confessed sneaker addict, I’ve been writing about men’s clothing and shoes for over a decade. During that time, I’ve managed to grasp a deep understanding of what makes a great product. Using this knowledge and some help from online reviewers, I have pulled together eight of the best white men’s sneakers (having started with a list longer than the New York Yankees’ trophy cabinet). Final Verdict And there you have it my fellow footwear fanatics: the best white sneakers for men. Adding a pair to your collection is not just a fashion statement; it’s a shrewd sartorial move that strengthens your options and ensures you always have something to turn to. Axel Arigato’s Clean 90 remains one of my favorite recommendation. Crafted from smooth white leather, they’re a super stylish, versatile option that looks great with everything from jeans and sweaters to casual tailoring and smart-casual shirts. They’ll last, always look fresh (if you look after them), and strike the perfect balance between form and function. FAQ White sneakers are a great option for any man, regardless of his sartorial preference. Versatile and timeless, they effortlessly complement a variety of outfits, from casual to semi-formal, providing a clean and stylish look. It doesn’t matter how old you are—men of all ages can wear white sneakers. You should always wear what you want and feel most comfortable with. Ultimately, the decision to wear socks with white sneakers is subjective and should align with individual style and comfort preferences. Having said that, you should always take the occasion into consideration. For example, when it comes to everyday outfits, wearing socks with jeans is a great idea. However, if you’re on vacation wearing shorts, you should probably go without. Billy is a content specialist and social media manager.
