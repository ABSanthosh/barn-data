  "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Kyley Warren The moment temperatures land above 70 degrees, you'll find me in a swimsuit. Growing up in Arizona, I can recall spending countless summers sprawled out on a pool float and conjuring up any excuse to be in the water as often as possible - trust me, it's basically the only way to survive back-to-back months of 115-degree temperatures. While I might not get to spend as much time poolside as I'd prefer these days (because, adulting), I still try to stock up on as many different types of bikinis and one-pieces as possible, that way I'm prepared for whatever the summer months may bring - including a weekend beach trip or two. Naturally, you can imagine my excitement after discovering that Free People's Free-est swimsuit line with pieces that prioritize style, functionality, and sustainability. Free People was kind enough to send me a sample from the collection in order to get a feel for the collection's unique materials, patterns, and fits. I chose to test out the Free-est Amber One-Piece Swimsuit ($168) in a limited-edition print. While my exact pattern is no longer available, they do offer various prints each season like the Free-est Amber Printed One-Piece Swimsuit ($178). The second I slipped the piece on, I knew I'd just found my go-to swimsuit for the season. What I Like About the Free-est Amber One-Piece Swimsuit As someone with a larger bust, it's been a struggle trying to find a sexy bathing suit that flatters my body and curves but still manages to keep everything tucked in and feeling secure - this is especially the case with one-piece bathing suits. The styles are either too plunging or too conservative, with seemingly no middle ground, thus forcing me to invest in different one-pieces for different occasions - like a high-neck swimsuit for sporty beach dates and a strapless one-piece for tanning. This FB Beach swimsuit is the first style I've ever owned that I feel comfortable and supported enough to wear for it all. The one-piece bathing suit is made from a recycled polyamide and elastane material that has just enough stretch to move around in but is still formfitting enough that it hugs the body and keeps me feeling secure. While the style has a plunging neckline and open-back design, it also comes fitted with adjustable shoulder straps and a tie back, so I can tweak the piece's fit as needed. The one-piece's high-leg silhouette completes the style with a leg-baring design that's so perfect for tanning or any occasion where you want to show a little extra skin. I also love that this Free People piece is made from eco-conscious, recycled fibers, so it's a style I can feel good about wearing. What's Worth Noting About the Free-est Amber One-Piece Swimsuit While this bathing suit's upper coverage is great, it is a bit skimpier toward the bottom and has a tendency to fit more like a thong bathing suit - somewhat unintentionally, too. I am typically a medium in bathing suits and opted for a similar size with this one-piece style. Unlike other Free People swimsuits, namely the Free-est Pamela One-Piece Swimsuit ($148), which has a thong-like design, this piece appeared to have a more traditional fit with enough material to provide plenty of backside coverage. But despite the product photos on the model, this bathing suit actually does ride up quite a bit in the crotch area. While not uncomfortable, it certainly shows a bit more skin on the hips than I was expecting, and if you're looking for a piece with ample coverage all around, I might recommend another FP Beach style like this Free-est Heidi Surf One-Piece Swimsuit ($198). Who Is the Free-est Amber One-Piece Swimsuit Best For? Whether you're an avid tanner in need of a skin-baring bathing suit, a sports enthusiast obsessed with competing outside (but less keen on wearing tons of layers in the heat), or just a water-lover who's committed to spending as much time by the ocean and lake as possible, this sporty one-piece is great for anyone looking to invest in a comfortable swimsuit that's secure, sustainable, and, of course, incredibly stylish. Where Is the Free-est Amber One-Piece Swimsuit Available? This one-piece swimsuit is available to shop exclusively at Free People. Additional Details While my version features a burgundy floral print, the Amber One-Piece comes in several fun colorways, including stone, lime green, black, and orchid pink. This swimsuit is available to shop in US women's sizes XS through XL, and it's recommended that shoppers reference Free People's size guide to find their perfect fit. This one-piece, along with all of the other styles in the collection, are made with eco-conscious fibers that include recyclable and degradable materials. These thoughtful designs are a small part of Free People's larger mission to promote more circularity in fashion and reduce the brand's carbon footprint.

href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/sexy-swimsuits-45625212\"\u003esexy bathing suit\u003c/a\u003e that flatters my body and curves but still manages to keep everything tucked in and feeling secure — this is especially the case with one-piece bathing suits. The styles are either too plunging or too conservative, with seemingly no middle ground, thus forcing me to invest in different one-pieces for different occasions — like a high-neck swimsuit for sporty beach dates and a strapless one-piece for tanning. This FB Beach swimsuit is the first style I\u0026#39;ve ever owned that I feel comfortable and supported enough to wear for it all. \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"5\"\u003eThe one-piece bathing suit is made from a recycled polyamide and elastane material that has just enough stretch to move around in but is still formfitting enough that it hugs the body and keeps me feeling secure. While the style has a plunging neckline and open-back design, it also comes fitted with adjustable shoulder straps and a tie back, so I can tweak the piece\u0026#39;s fit as needed. The one-piece\u0026#39;s high-leg silhouette completes the style with a leg-baring design that\u0026#39;s so perfect for tanning or any occasion where you want to show a little extra skin. I also love that this Free People piece is made from eco-conscious, recycled fibers, so it\u0026#39;s a style I can feel good about wearing.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure data-element-type=\"ParagraphImage\" data-element-index=\"3\"\u003e\u003cpicture data-testid=\"picture-tag\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/kWoBZ9eRuV8yyq3MAfgfysJCMI4=/fit-in/792x1056/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2023/03/28/701/n/1922564/tmp_hmBc8Q_7659b616b7b92f18_RNI-Films-IMG-C5B78A31-8E04-40D0-A021-B237BB519226.jpg\" alt=\"woman wearing FB Beach Amber One-Piece Swimsuit\" width=\"792\" height=\"1056\" srcset=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/kWoBZ9eRuV8yyq3MAfgfysJCMI4=/fit-in/792x1056/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2023/03/28/701/n/1922564/tmp_hmBc8Q_7659b616b7b92f18_RNI-Films-IMG-C5B78A31-8E04-40D0-A021-B237BB519226.jpg 1000w, https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/GMWEijJygAMUrZefG1EnkMUQO6Y=/fit-in/1584x2112/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2023/03/28/701/n/1922564/tmp_hmBc8Q_7659b616b7b92f18_RNI-Films-IMG-C5B78A31-8E04-40D0-A021-B237BB519226.jpg 2000w\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePS Photography | Kyley Warren\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv data-element-type=\"ParagraphBodyText\" data-element-index=\"4\" data-element-has-beginning-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"0\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat\u0026#39;s Worth Noting About the Free-est Amber One-Piece Swimsuit\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"1\"\u003eWhile this bathing suit\u0026#39;s upper coverage is great, it is a bit skimpier toward the bottom and has a tendency to fit more like a thong bathing suit — somewhat unintentionally, too.
