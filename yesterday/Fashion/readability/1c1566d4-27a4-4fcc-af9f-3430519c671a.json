Business professional. Snappy flirty bee-bop symbiotic reliable. Ugh. But like it or not, attire labels are here to stay—and it behooves you to lean into some more than others. Business professional attire for men, for example. That’s a biggie. Now, what that essentially equates to is “suit and tie,” but there’s some nuance involved. From the type of tie you wear to your jacket’s lapel, the devil’s in the details. Maybe you’re an attorney or you work in finance. Maybe you’re a politician. Maybe you received an invitation to some networking event that’s definitely going to be awkward. No matter your motivation, you must eventually reckon with the unwritten rules of business attire for men. That time is now. That place is here. That’s… a lot of buildup for basically some super-curated office attire. Key Takeaways  Business professional attire for men more or less amounts to a suit and tie. If you’re just starting to build out your look, go with a classic two-piece suit in a neutral color like the Perennial Tailored Fit Havana Suit from Suitsupply. And even though you’ll want to keep things mostly conservative, don’t be afraid to punch things up by wearing a tie with some subtle personality. In This ArticleKey PiecesHow To ChooseFinal VerdictFAQs brooksbrothers / Instagram What is business professional attire for men? Put simply, business professional attire for men calls for a suit and tie. But within that broad stroke are several areas of nuance, and even a bit of wiggle room to get creative. Though there are plenty of other details to hone in on, among your top priorities should be dress shirts, dress shoes, a nice tie, and a well-fitted suit in a neutral color. 1. Business Professional Suits  A versatile, comfortable suit that’s made well and fits well is the cornerstone of professional work attire for men. The neutral canvas upon which the rest of your look is painted, if you will. You won’t? Fair enough. But alas, it’s true. Note, though, that business professional isn’t the place to get super creative when it comes to suits. Generally, you’ll want to stick with a classic two-piece suit with notched lapels. And don’t sleep on the color—you can’t go wrong with navy blue, but charcoal gray isn’t far behind in terms of the staples. If your career requires you to wear a suit every day, feel free to add in the occasional pinstripe or season-appropriate shade to mix things up. If you’re looking for a place to start, Suitsupply’s Perennial Tailored Fit Havana Suit will serve you well, and for years. 2. Business Professional Pants Not all offices or professional situations require full suits, but that doesn’t mean you’re off the hook. You’ll still need a quality pair of pants to team up with your blazer and tie. And though the same general neutral-color rules apply, there’s more room to get creative if your workplace is game. Khaki pants with a navy blazer. A subtle seersucker. You get it. Now more than ever, manufacturers are getting clever with how they’re constructing their dress pants. Take Bonobos and their Weekday Warrior Dress Pants, for example. It’s got the look and feel of a traditional pair of dress pants but features a soft, wrinkle-resistant fabric for peak covert comfort. Pair it with the Jetsetter Blazer or your favorite jacket for a business professional look without the business professional feel. 3. Business Professional Shirts Of course, no business professional ensemble is complete without the humble workhorse that is the dress shirt. The safest and most comfortable play is a handsome white Oxford or another type of shirt that’ll look great with a tie and a pair of dress pants. Besnard has a handful of super-soft Oxfords in various colors and cuts and is as good a place as any to stock up. Speaking of stocking up, always make white your first stop. You’ll need several white button-downs in your rotation, followed by light blue. As with a few of the other garments on this list, there’s some room for improvisation depending on the vibe in your office. And if you find yourself traveling for work, you’ll definitely want to look into picking up a non-iron dress shirt or two. 4. Business Professional Belt Another workhorse in the world of business professional attire for men, the belt should be considered anything but an afterthought. But before you even think about picking up anything else, make sure you first have a black leather belt and a brown leather belt ready to go. As for the hardware, go with a classic rectangular tongue buckle or a slightly rounded buckle. Velasca has created a shining example of the species with its durable calf leather belt they’ve dubbed “Cinta” (Italian for belt). The naming-things guy must’ve had the day off. Regardless, let it be your North Star when it comes time to pick out a business professional belt. 5. Business Professional Shoes Which brings us to your shoes. Your all-important, statement-making shoes. Along with any accessories you choose to pepper into your business professional attire, your dress shoes play a huge role in defining your look. You can’t go wrong with a pair of Oxfords or cap-toe shoes, and these are by far the most traditional, widely-accepted styles when it comes to business professional attire for men. Another handsome look for a more casual approach is a pair of leather loafers. Myrqvist’s Stenhammar is a classic, elevated shoe that’s ready for the office and beyond. 6. Business Professional Socks Your socks don’t say as much about your style as, say, your suit or ties do. But they’re still going to peek out from time to time. And when they do, you’ll want to make sure they live up to the standards of the rest of your gear. The best business professional sock colors? You guessed it, blue and black. London Sock Co. offers an outstanding 6-pack of tailored, Scottish Lyle cotton socks that’ll keep your feet cozy all day long. You don’t have to overthink this part of your suit, but you do need to make sure they’re made well, look great, and come in business professional-appropriate colors. 7. Business Professional Bags (backpack/briefcase) Whether you drive across town or live in the city and commute to work on foot, you’re going to need a work bag or briefcase. Not only does a quality bag complete the business professional look, it’s a functional accessory that’ll serve you and your belongings well for years. Steele \u0026 Borough’s The Laptop Bag is water-resistant, full of thoughtful pockets, and adds a pop of color by way of vegan leather trim throughout. Like ties, blazers, and socks, your bag is a way to weave some interest into an otherwise neutral and conservative outfit. 8. Business Professional Ties Since you’ll likely only have a handful of suits in your closet at any given time, keeping several ties at your disposal is a great way to beef up your business professional wardrobe. Before diving headlong into the endless colors and designs at your disposal, pick up a few ties in solid colors. It’s a classic, conservative look that you’ll want covered should the environment call for it. Otherwise, stripes and other lowkey patterns are also fair game. As ever, let your workplace’s atmosphere and preferred attire be your guide. That said, neckties are your chance to splash some personality into the mix. Charles Tyrwhitt’s impressive lineup of ties, for example, includes a silk navy number emblazoned with florals. maverickandco_official / Instagram How To Choose Your Business Professional Attire Profession Now more than ever, employers are placing less emphasis on wardrobe requirements. But if you happen to have a career that demands a business professional look, you’ll need a handful of classic, conservative suits to wear from week to week. Work in a casual office that still calls for an elevated outfit? Feel free to mix and match blazers and pants, then add in some personality by way of colorful ties and a stylish briefcase. Occasion I’ve spent most of this list talking about the workplace, but there are plenty of other occasions in which you might find yourself reaching for a business professional look. Cocktail parties. Gallery openings. Weddings that aren’t black tie but still err on the formal side. Taking business professional outside of the workplace also allows you more freedom to experiment with patterns, colors, and accessories. Patterns And Colors It may seem obvious, but color palettes are key when it comes to choosing your business professional attire. Avoid loud patterns and bold colors, opting instead for suits with neutral tones that go with everything, like navy and dark gray. The same rules apply to ties and accessories—solid colors and thin stripes typically work best in a business professional environment. myrqvist / Instagram Final Verdict  Though much of this depends on your workplace and what it deems appropriate, business professional attire for men can essentially be boiled down to a suit and tie. The look is also largely defined by conservative pieces in neutral colors. Start with a two-piece classic like Suitsupply’s Perennial Tailored Fit Havana Suit and build things out from there. FAQ Yes, business professional attire for men generally consists of a suit, tie, and subtle accessories that add form and function to the look. That said, some workplaces or occasions offer the opportunity to mix and match pants, blazers, and accessories. Business professional attire almost always calls for a suit, tie, dress shirt, and dress shoes. Business attire is more loosely defined and, depending on the workplace or environment, can include outfits ranging anywhere from dress pants and a button-down to a nice pair of pants and a tucked-in polo shirt. By almost any standard, polo shirts are not considered business professional. They do, however, fall firmly into the business casual category, especially during the warmer months.
