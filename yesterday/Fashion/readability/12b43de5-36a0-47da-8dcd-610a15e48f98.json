According to the ruling reviewed by Reuters, the Italian court found the unit guilty of \"subcontracting production to Chinese-owned firms in Italy that exploited workers\" via 24/7 work days and a lack of safety equipment. While Valentino Bags Lab Srl faces no criminal charges, it's held responsible for failing to oversee its suppliers. It must now implement standard supply chain tools and measures verified by an external administrator. {Reuters}TikTok Live dominates live shopping platforms for consumer engagementOf the live shopping platforms, TikTok Live is bringing in the most consumer engagement compared to QVC and HSN, according to Savings.com data. Facebook Live and Instagram Live are the second and third most-watched platforms, respectively. That said, though nearly 60% of the surveyed adults watch live shopping, only half are making purchases. The respondents credited this to a lack of trust, sharing they'd be more inclined to make purchases if live shopping were backed by a notable brand or platform. Other ways to convert live shopping viewers into consumers are exclusive discounts, seamless checkout and guaranteed product quality. {Retail Dive}Front Row acquires Build in AmsterdamFront Row, a New York-based e-commerce management agency that's worked with Kosas and Le Mer, has acquired Shopify partner agency Build in Amsterdam.
