But should you find them, or visit the regions where they are produced, they might complement a special occasion.“For me, it’s really hard to buy things for people,” Ms. Masters said. “I don’t want to buy things they don’t want. But I know a bottle of wine — especially as we get older — is one of those gifts that will, most of the time, be understood and accepted. The effort that’s gone into making these wines just adds to the celebration and adds to the depth of conversation and the feeling that it’s a special day.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
