There is daylight during hours that are your own. Gift shops are a sea of Mother’s Day pink and Easter yellow.

You remember how much you like mini eggs. The first iced coffee of the season is not far off.All of which means one thing: spring is here. What is less certain, however, is how spring-like the weather will be. Some years spring comes all at once, the weather shifting gear in rhythm with the vibe shift. Other years, spring is a state of mind for weeks before it becomes tangible in the air.

Most often, we get a bit of both: a few false dawns when it is warm enough to venture out without a coat, and then chilly spells that catch you out before better weather starts in earnest. At the time of writing, it is not yet clear which we are in for.But you don’t need to wait for spring weather to dress for spring. Much better not to, in fact. The time that a spring update is most needed is in this liminal space when spring has sprung in your head but the weather isn’t reliably playing ball. Everyone is bored with the clothes they have been wearing all winter, but shorts are a long way off yet.So I thought it was time to consider a few easy updates that can bring a jolt of spring energy, in much the same way that the clocks jumping forward will do next week – without any risk of catching a chill, which is the last setback anyone wants at this point.The next sunny-but-cold day, go and dig out your sunglasses from the drawer they have been in since last summer. Shades always make you look glamorous, and paired with a big coat you have an immediate air of mystery. And no, it doesn’t look pretentious to wear shades on a cold day, not if the sun is shining.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionFeeling brave? Next time you need to buy a pair of tights, think about getting a coloured pair instead of yet more black opaques. Deep red is the easiest shade to wear, or rich blue. It feels less challenging to try coloured tights when you’re in ankle boots and a long coat than it will do when your legs are more exposed, and it’s a fun, inexpensive way to break up the dreary top-to-toe black. Look, just try it, OK? Or if that’s a hard no, then add a contrast belt if your coat doesn’t have one. Or have a dig around for that brightly coloured pair of gloves you were given at Christmas and sidelined in favour of your trusty neutral ones. Bright gloves look so cheerful. If you want to be really fancy, you can keep them tucked over the belt of your coat rather than stuffing them in your bag, so that they add a bit of visual interest, in the same way as a pocket square or a brooch. (But do keep an eye on them: lost gloves are so annoying.)Or try some new layering ideas. My top layering hack, if you find that layering tends to look cluttered or feel bulky, is to focus on one zone. Keep the visible evidence of layering to neckline or hemline, not both. So, if you make a feature of two necklines by wearing a high-necked sweater under a crew-neck jacket, then tuck your sweater into your trousers to keep that part of your silhouette neat and unfussy, rather than having your layers show at the waist. Or make a feature of layering by wearing a long shirt loose under a crew-neck sweater, so that the shirt tails show – but leave the collar of the shirt tucked inside the sweater to keep the neckline clean, instead of pulling the collar points over.If all else fails? Dig out a favourite lightweight summer frock. Add knee-high boots and tie a warm sweater around your shoulders. Weather is unpredictable, but a great outfit will always put a spring in your step.Model: Tomiris at Milk. Styling assistant: Sam Deaman.
