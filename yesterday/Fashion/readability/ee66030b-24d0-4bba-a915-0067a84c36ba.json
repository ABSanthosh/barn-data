  "description": "Your eyes are precious, so it’s important to keep ‘em as healthy and stylish as possible. On those supremely bright and sunny days, that means putting on a pair of trendy sunglasses to protect your delicate pupils from harmful UV rays, glare, dust — or paparazzi flashes when out with your digital camera friend.We know that the world of shaded eyewear can be overwhelming, with sunglasses coming in all sorts of shapes, sizes, and widths. That’s why we put together this mini guide to the best sunglasses to look out for, categorized by style, lens type, and activity — and with options for every budget. Whether you're looking for a pair of statement sunglasses for your next vacation, prescription glasses to give your eyes a rest from contacts, or colorful frames to match your wardrobe, there are plenty of options out there. We've even got you covered with polarized styles, sporty shades, and designs for wider faces. So, if one style doesn’t work for you, we guarantee there’s another pair of sunnies around the corner that will. Now, go forth and keep those rays at bay.All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.The Best Brands For Prescription SunglassesAs any glasses-wearer will know, shopping for a new pair of prescription sunglasses is a major decision. Not only are you committing to a pair of frames if and until your prescription changes, but it’s a choice that will cost you a pretty penny. This is why we’re such fans of Pair Eyewear, a brand all about choice and customization at affordable prices. You can choose from a variety of prescription frames — all starting at $70 — and select from hundreds of customizable “tops”; aka magnetic, flat frames that cover the front of your glasses to instantly change their appearance. This means that using the same stylish frame as a base, you can switch seamlessly between eyeglasses and sunglasses, or between different colored and patterned options — ideal for matching your specs to your outfit! (There are also plenty of sunglasses-only options available, too.)If you’re after a little more luxury, there are several other brands always on our rotation: Ace \u0026 Tate, Warby Parker, and Cubitts offer chic, stylish frames within the $100 to $300 price range.Pair Eyewear The Payton, $, available at Pair EyewearWarby Parker Lupin, $, available at Warby ParkerCubitts Grimaldi, $, available at Cubittsace \u0026 tate Selma, $, available at ace \u0026 tateThe Best Brands For Polarized SunglassHeard of polarized sunglasses but are not sure of their benefits?
