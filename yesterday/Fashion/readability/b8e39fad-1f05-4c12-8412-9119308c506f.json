  "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Anvita Reddy In order to make my sleep environment feel comfortable and luxurious, I went on a hunt for the most comfortable mattress, a supportive pillow wrapped in a silky pillowcase, and sheets that feel like a cloud. But the cornerstone of my sleep setup is always my pajamas. In fact, I've made it a habit to wear matching pajama sets to get my mind and body ready for bed. I've searched high and low for the most comfortable pair, but with my high standards, it took me so long to find the perfect PJs. I needed them to feel like butter on my skin, but also lightweight and breathable so that I could wear them all year long. And of course, they had to look cute. When I came across Cozy Earth's Bamboo Pajama Set ($156, originally $195), I was curious to see what the hype was about, especially since it was an item on Oprah's Favorite Things list two years in a row. My fellow editors raved endlessly about the brand's cashmere cardigan and bamboo sheets, so I had high hopes for these pajamas. Believe me when I say they did not disappoint. And right now, they're 20 percent off, so there's no better time to treat yourself and stock up on these luxe PJs. What I Like About the Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set: Image Source: PS Photography / Anvita Reddy Cozy Earth's Bamboo Pajama Set is by far the best pair of pajamas I have ever owned. From the feel to the look, these exude luxury. But let's start with the texture and the fabric, since these are the standout details. The brand says the pajamas are made from viscose from bamboo, but the material might as well be described as \"slices of heaven.\" It's silky and smooth with cloudlike softness, with the ideal amount of slip that allows you to move around without friction. The fabric offers a bit of stretch and flexibility, too. The PJs are warm and cozy yet lightweight and breathable, meaning I can wear them through all seasons of the year. While a matching set will always appear polished, these PJs embody quiet luxury. The collar and contrast piping deliver a tailored look, while the flattering yet relaxed fit is perfect for achieving comfort. The fabric also drapes beautifully with minimal wrinkles, so you'll look elevated - even if your hair is disheveled and you're hungover. The long-sleeved button-down top is equipped with an elegant pocket that adds sophisticated flair. The bottoms have an adjustable-tie waistband, so you have a secure fit no matter how much you toss and turn at night. The Bamboo Pajama Set makes me excited to go to bed, so although it's an investment, it's one that you'll actually enjoy. Needless to say, it's really difficult to change out of these in the morning. What's Worth Noting About the Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set: The Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set has a relaxed, slightly oversize fit, so you don't have to worry about sizing up. As someone who is 5'1\", an extra small fit just right, leaving me with some room. The brand offers both regular and tall sizing, too, especially if you need extra length for your arms and legs. The brand also recommends sizing down if you're in-between sizes. Although these pajamas have proven themselves to be quite durable, proper care and maintenance are never a bad idea to extend shelf life. The brand recommends machine washing on cold with a normal detergent and no fabric softener or bleach and to machine dry normally. I like to put them in the delicates or gentle cycle, just to be extra cautious. Who's the Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set Best For? Image Source: PS Photography / Anvita Reddy The Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set is best for everyone and anyone who wants to truly invest in their sleepwear. The luxuriously soft fabric is so gentle on your skin, and it is breathable and stretchy, so it's great for those who sleep hot or want something lightweight for bed. Whether you're a homebody who loves to indulge and takes their sleep pretty seriously, or you're shopping for a luxe gift for your loved one, these pajamas are a purchase you won't regret. Is the Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set Worth the Splurge? These pajamas are no doubt a luxury, treat-yourself type of purchase and are in no way a true necessity. However, if you're like me and you enjoy splurging on sleep must haves, these Cozy Earth pajamas are worth every penny. I have tried cheaper alternatives that have the same feel, but they simply aren't as long-lasting. In fact, most of the alternatives lose their softness after several washes and they start to pill, if not rip and tear. I've had pairs of Cozy Earth pajamas that I put through the wash at least 15 to 20 times, and they still look and feel brand-spanking new. Plus, the brand is so confident in the quality of these pajamas that they offer a 10-year warranty and a 100-night sleep trial. Additional Details: Cozy Earth's Stretch-Knit Bamboo Pajama Set is made from 95 percent bamboo-based viscose and five percent spandex. These Cozy Earth Pajamas come in four colors. The pajamas are available in sizes XS–XXXL, in regular and tall lengths. They have a slightly relaxed fit. The brand offers a 10-year warranty, a 100-night sleep trial, and free shipping. Where Is the Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set Available? The Bamboo Pajama Set is available on cozyearth.com, and a select few colors and sizes are available on Amazon.

I like to put them in the delicates or gentle cycle, just to be extra cautious. \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"6\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWho\u0026#39;s the Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set Best For?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure data-element-type=\"ParagraphImage\" data-element-index=\"6\"\u003e\u003cpicture data-testid=\"picture-tag\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/BgSL1yY1fhlWePZ0xdKE3AtaFjc=/fit-in/792x1056/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2023/09/25/987/n/1922564/tmp_XpgJPe_63c94f91f7d9c92a_IMG_1451.jpg\" alt=\"Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set on bed.\" width=\"792\" height=\"1056\" srcset=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/BgSL1yY1fhlWePZ0xdKE3AtaFjc=/fit-in/792x1056/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2023/09/25/987/n/1922564/tmp_XpgJPe_63c94f91f7d9c92a_IMG_1451.jpg 1000w, https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/UJftKlg1d0_fQtRPorCit8n85SA=/fit-in/1584x2112/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2023/09/25/987/n/1922564/tmp_XpgJPe_63c94f91f7d9c92a_IMG_1451.jpg 2000w\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePS Photography | Anvita Reddy\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv data-element-type=\"ParagraphBodyText\" data-element-index=\"7\"\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"0\"\u003e The Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set is best for everyone and anyone who wants to truly invest in their sleepwear. The luxuriously soft fabric is so gentle on your skin, and it is breathable and stretchy, so it\u0026#39;s great for those who sleep hot or want something lightweight for bed. Whether you\u0026#39;re a homebody who loves to indulge and takes their sleep pretty seriously, or you\u0026#39;re shopping for a luxe gift for your loved one, these pajamas are a purchase you won\u0026#39;t regret.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"1\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eIs the Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set Worth the Splurge?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"2\"\u003eThese pajamas are no doubt a luxury, treat-yourself type of purchase and are in no way a true necessity. However, if you\u0026#39;re like me and you enjoy splurging on sleep must haves, these Cozy Earth pajamas are worth every penny. I have tried cheaper alternatives that have the same feel, but they simply aren\u0026#39;t as long-lasting. In fact, most of the alternatives lose their softness after several washes and they start to pill, if not rip and tear. I\u0026#39;ve had pairs of Cozy Earth pajamas that I put through the wash at least 15 to 20 times, and they still look and feel brand-spanking new. Plus, the brand is so confident in the quality of these pajamas that they offer a 10-year warranty and a 100-night sleep trial. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"3\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAdditional Details:\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv data-element-index=\"4\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"false\"\u003e\u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003eCozy Earth\u0026#39;s Stretch-Knit Bamboo Pajama Set is made from 95 percent bamboo-based viscose and five percent spandex.\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eThese Cozy Earth Pajamas come in four colors.\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eThe pajamas are available in sizes XS–XXXL, in regular and tall lengths.
