See the full list here. {The Hollywood Reporter}Victoria's Secret is the latest brand to abandon DEIVictoria's Secret stopped its promotion goal for Black workers and altered its language on diversity, equity and inclusion, making it the latest brand to change its policies in light of the U.S. government and conservative activists' attack on corporate representation goals. Victoria's Secret replaced references to DEI efforts with text on \"inclusion and belonging\" and took down a section of its website on supplier diversity. \"We are steadfast in our commitment to inclusion and belonging because it's foundational to our company and to a high-performance culture,\" a company representative said in a statement, adding that the company will continue to have \"the best talent with diverse perspectives\" while \"being fully compliant with the law.\" Victoria's Secret's diversity efforts have been closely watched after the company faced allegations of sexual misconduct, bullying and harassment, as well as criticism for its lack of size inclusivity. {Bloomberg/paywalled}i-D returns to print with its Spring 2025 issueMarking its return to print, i-D released its Spring 2025 issue titled \"The Unknown Issue\" on Thursday. This is the first print issue under Editor-in-Chief and Chief Brand Officer Thom Bettridge, as well as Karlie Kloss's Bedford Media. In addition to the magazine's punk-inspired redesign, the issue features three covers, the first starring Enza Khoury, an 18-year-old aspiring actress from Ohio who i-D says represents \"the next generation of creativity in America.\" Photographed by Aidan Zamiri and styled by Clare Byrne, Khoury wears Gucci on the cover. The two other cover stars will be announced soon. \"This new issue is a manifesto of what we're about as a brand, across all channels physical and digital,\" Bettridge said in a statement. \"Our aim was to tap into the spirit of i-D's roots, as an irreverent tastemaker and home for new ideas, but to adapt this vision for how our brains work today.\" \"The Unknown Issue\" will be available to order at i-D.co from March 6 and on sale at newsstands and specialty stores from March 24. {i-D}Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesViktor \u0026 Rolf is returning to ready-to-wearViktor \u0026 Rolf's ready-to-wear line is returning after a decade-long hiatus with its Fall 2025 collection. The Amsterdam-based fashion house is bringing its couture experience to everyday fashion, blending \"abstraction with wearability\" in garments like tailored balloon trousers, a cropped belted jacket, tulle dresses and voluminous outerwear. Viktor \u0026 Rolf drew inspiration from the label's Fall 2024 Haute Couture collection titled \"Haute Abstraction\" by combining dramatic silhouettes and bold shapes with wearable design. The Fall 2025 collection was photographed by Alessandro Furchino Capria on the streets of Paris. See the collection above. {Fashionista inbox}Inside the making of Sarah Burton's GivenchySarah Burton makes her Givenchy debut on Friday after being appointed to the position in September of 2024. Burton hails from Alexander McQueen, where she began as Lee's assistant and later assumed the creative director role. At Givenchy, the house's DNA has become a bit muddled following the tenures of Matthew M. Williams and Clare Waight Keller, so Burton is going back to Hubert de Givenchy's first show in 1952 held in a hôtel particulier on rue Alfred de Vigny. During a renovation of that hôtel particulier, a stash of trash bags containing archival patterns from Givenchy's first collection were discovered inside a wall, and Burton displayed one of the designs in her office. But Burton's Givenchy debut won't be a regurgitated copy of vintage Givenchy: The designer is focusing on the house's original silhouette-driven simplicity. {Vogue Business/paywalled}The fake fashion campaigns showing AI's future in marketingSybille de Saint Louvent, who describes herself as an independent creative director, creates fake fashion campaigns using AI. Her AI campaigns for brands like Jil Sander and Prada have sparked online attention, and she even posted an AI campaign for Gucci that she said was commissioned by the brand. She told Business of Fashion that Gucci gave her \"carte blanche to create a series of visuals exploring the theme of duality\" in its Fall 2025 show. Generative AI has gone mainstream, and brands have been experimenting with it to produce digital models, social content and marketing campaigns. As AI's technology improves, its output has grown more realistic and de Saint Louvent's campaigns offer a glimpse into what the future of AI marketing could look like. {Business of Fashion/paywalled}Troye Sivan covers CR Fashion BookTroye Sivan is CR Fashion Book's latest cover star with three separate covers. Photographed by Sebastián Faena and styled by Marc Forné, Sivan wears Prada throughout. In the interview conducted by Vienna Vernose, Sivan discusses growing up in the digital era, navigating fame and claiming his confidence creatively and personally. CR Fashion Book Issue 26 Behind The Scenes will be available on newsstands on March 24, or can be pre-ordered for $52 here. {CR Fashion Book}Homepage image: Stefanie Keenan/Getty Images for Fashion Trust U.S.Tune into the Fashionista Network to join the conversation with fashion and beauty industry leaders.
