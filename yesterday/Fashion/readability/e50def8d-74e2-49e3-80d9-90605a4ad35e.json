  "text": "Last night, guests gathered on the Tiffany Landmark terrace with its sweeping view of the New York skyline. They were there for an intimate dinner in celebration of the brand’s new HardWear campaign, featuring acclaimed contemporary artist Anna Weyant. The painter wore a Graduated Link Necklace from the collection in yellow gold with pavé, complemented by yellow gold Link Earrings and a Link bracelet. The night kicked off in high style. World-renowned chef Daniel Boulud designed a custom menu, while guests enjoyed glasses of a bespoke Ruinart Blanc de Blancs, created specially for Tiffany \u0026 Co. Notable attendees included Laura Harrier, Karen Elson, Chase Sui Wonders, Aweng Ade-Chuol, Phoebe Gates, Jessie Andrews, and Ruby Aldridge, who curated the music for the evening. The campaign was lensed by photographer Harley Weir and stars Weyant alongside Tiffany \u0026 Co. ambassadors Mikey Madison and Greta Lee. In a series of short films, each member of the trio examined their personal definitions of strength and love. Dressed in all black, creating a blank canvas that highlights the beauty of the HardWear pieces, Weyant explains in her video, “I believe the people who hold onto joy, through everything, are the strongest people alive.” Inspiration for the collection dates all the way back to a design initially crafted in 1962. With this reference, the pieces also channel the unique and iconic architecture of Tiffany \u0026 Co.’s birthplace, New York City. The HardWear collection’s lasting legacy speaks to the timelessness of the brand’s designs and its resonance across a new generation of women artists. See Inside the Tiffany \u0026 Co.
