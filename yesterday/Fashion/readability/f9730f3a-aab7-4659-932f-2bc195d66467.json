Though I frequently fly the flag for individuality, there are certain staples that every guy needs should he want to build a reliable, long-lasting wardrobe. Amongst those is the white shirt. From days in the office to weddings and graduation ceremonies, the best white dress shirts for men are the perfect blank canvas for just about any life event. Which is why it pays to invest in a great one (or three). To help, I’ve spent the past few weeks searching for the cream of the crop—the undisputed closet champions that can be dressed up or down and paired with a plethora of suit and tie options. Keep reading to discover what I found. Key Takeaways The ultimate foundational piece, the white dress shirt is one of the most timeless styles a man can own. A must-have regardless of sartorial preference or career, it’s the type of shirt that’ll take you from Monday morning meetings to weekend drinks and everything in between. To find the best white dress shirts for men, I scoured the internet, rounding up trusted brands and reading ratings and reviews before settling on seven standout styles, including options from Savile Row Company and Luca Faloni. In This Article Our PicksBuying ConsiderationsHow We ChoseWhy Trust Us? Final VerdictFAQs View More On Luca Faloni Best Overall: Savile Row Company Slim Poplin Dress Shirt Why it’s great: Savile Row Company has been in the shirt-making business for more than 80 years, so it’s no surprise that the brand is my go-to for the best white dress shirts for men. This one is made from a crisp, easy-to-iron cotton fabric that washes well and gets softer after every wear. The curl-resistant collar ensures a pristine appearance at all times, and you can take your pick from single or French cuffs. Who is this for? If you need a do-it-all shirt that can be worn at weddings, work events, and weekends, then this versatile design hits the mark. Flaws but not deal-breakers: Though the cut is slim, it still has a fairly roomy silhouette that might feel baggy on particularly slender builds. Material: 100% Cotton | Sizes: 14–18” | Care: Machine wash Best Everyday: Luca Faloni Brushed Cotton Shirt Why it’s great: Silky and soft, Luca Faloni’s white dress shirt really does feel as good as it looks. The cotton has been gently brushed for ultimate comfort, and the slim fit shape gently hugs all the right places (it’s also available in a classic cut). Complete with mother-of-pearl buttons and a one-piece ‘Paramontura’ collar, it’s one of the best white dress shirts for men, an excellent all-rounder that’ll look just as good with suits as it does with jeans or chinos. Who is this for? A versatile design that can be worn tucked in or out, this feels a touch more relaxed than some of the other shirts on this list, making it an excellent choice for every day. Flaws but not deal-breakers: Though the cotton fabric is breathable, the brushed effect does trap in the heat, which means that it might get a little stuffy during particularly hot days. Material: 100% Cotton | Sizes: XS–4XL | Care: Machine wash Best Budget: J.VER Stretch Dress Shirt Why it’s great: One thing I noticed when looking for the best men’s white dress shirts is that there are plenty of affordable options out there for guys on a budget—though, unfortunately, many of them aren’t up to standards. This one, however, definitely is. Given five stars for its fit, quality, and comfort, the Amazon bestseller is hard to beat. Boasting a cotton construction with a hint of stretch, it promises a super soft handle and resistance to tricky stains. One of the best white dress shirts for men, it also comes in a huge size range that caters to men of all builds and heights. Who is this for? Looking for a low-cost, everyday shirt that will hold up through washes and wear? You’ve found it. This is a brilliant budget option that is ideal for regular and sporadic wearers alike. Flaws but not deal-breakers: It doesn’t come with collar stays, nor does it have the option to add your own. This means that you might find that the collar starts to curl after a few wears – which you’ll need to fix with an iron should you not want to become known as the curly collar guy. Material: 95% Cotton, 5% Spandex | Sizes: S–6XL | Care: Machine wash Best on Amazon: Van Heusen Poplin Dress Shirt Why it’s great: I was a little skeptical when I first saw this design from Van Heusen. Mainly because I hadn’t heard much about the brand other than that they offer affordable apparel, including pants and casual shirts. Turns out they also have one of the best white dress shirts for men. Given the five-star thumbs-up by thousands of Amazon customers, it’s loved for its comfort, quality, and value for money. You’ll probably wear it most with suits and ties, but you can also dress it down with a blazer and slim chinos. Who is this for? It’s a no-brainer if you want a quality dress shirt that’s affordable, generously cut, goes with just about anything and soft against your skin. Flaws but not deal-breakers: The fabric is quite thin, so you may want to wear an undershirt on chilly days. Material: 65% Polyester, 35% Cotton | Sizes: 14–18.5” | Care: Machine wash Best Luxury: Etro Paisley-Jacquard Dress Shirt Why it’s great: From a distance, this looks like just another regular white dress shirt, but look a little closer, and it’s quite clearly not. This is one of the best white dress shirts for men. Crafted from cotton that’s lightweight and non-stretchy, it’s jacquard-woven with a tonal paisley pattern that’ll be a topic of conversation at business events, office days, and after-work drinks. Once you’ve stopped looking at the intricate detailing, you’ll soon discover the beautiful mother-of-pearl buttons and classic spread collar. Who is this for? Strictly for splurgers and lovers of luxury, this Etro shirt is a unique design that requires a pretty hefty investment. Flaws but not deal-breakers: The price tag may put many off, but if you’re lucky enough to be able to afford it, then you’ll soon discover why it costs so much. Material: 100% Cotton | Sizes: S–4XL | Care: Machine wash Best Work: David Donahue Trim Fit Oxford Dress Shirt Why it’s great: Whether you’re heading off on a business trip or making your way into the office, comfort is key—not forgetting style and smartness. Which is why you need a dress shirt like David Donahue’s. This is one of the best white dress shirts for men. Cut from a subtly textured yet substantial and soft oxford cloth (the type you find on your favorite button-down) and finished with a French placket and rounded cuffs, it’s a brilliantly versatile design that doesn’t require an undershirt or excessive ironing. Who is this for? The silhouette is slim, trim, and designed for athletic builds that want a shirt that’s fitted through the chest, armholes, and sides. Flaws but not deal-breakers: If you’re over 6ft with particularly long arms, then you might find that the sleeves come up a touch short. Material: 100% Cotton | Sizes: 14.5–19” | Care: Machine wash Best Athletic: State \u0026 Liberty The Springer Shirt Why it’s great: Crafted from performance stretch fabrics, State \u0026 Liberty’s dress shirt is moisture-wicking, lightweight, and wrinkle-free, so you can wear it on a busy subway and arrive at the office unscathed. Men’s white dress shirts don’t get much better than this. My favorite feature is the stainless steel collar stays that’ll keep your collar crisp. I also love how you can personalize it with monogramming on the cuff. Who is this for? Designed with more room in the upper body with a tapered waist, this will work for most builds but particularly those with broad chests and flat stomachs. If you’re a gym-goer who struggles to find smart shirts that fit, then this is definitely the one for you. Flaws but not deal-breakers: This style accentuates small waists, so it might bring unwanted attention to beer bellies and love handles. Material: Polyester/Spandex | Sizes: XS–XXXL | Care: Machine wash stateandliberty / Instagram Buying Considerations for the Best White Dress Shirts For Men Fit One of your very first considerations with men’s white dress shirts should be the fit; this determines how it will look and feel on your body.

A well-fitting shirt will not only enhance your appearance but also ensure that you’re comfortable throughout the day. Fabric The fabric of a dress shirt is crucial for both comfort and functionality. Cotton, because of its breathability and softness, is the most versatile and easy to care for. You may also want to consider designs with added stretch or moisture-wicking capabilities, as this makes the shirt more suitable for active or professional environments. Style The best men’s white dress shirts come in various designs, from tuxedo shirts to business styles, each with unique features that complement different occasions and personal tastes. Pay close attention to the collar, cuffs, and buttons, and choose the shirt that aligns with your preferences and the dress code of the events you plan to attend. savilerowco / Instagram How We Chose I started by researching more than 50 popular dress shirts, ensuring that I had picked out a variety of options in different colors, fits, and styles. Based on specs, personal experience, recommendations, and user reviews, I then narrowed the field to 20 before using the below criteria to finish up with seven spectacular shirts. Sizing: I focused on brands that offered a comprehensive size range and also those that provided options for both standard, short, and tall sizes. Detailed size charts and customer reviews helped me gauge the fit accuracy, especially regarding sleeve length and torso fit. Price: Both the upfront cost and the long-term value were considered. I looked for shirts that provided a good balance of quality and affordability, aiming for options that were competitively priced without compromising on construction or fabric quality. Quality: Quality was paramount in finding the best men’s white dress shirts. I assessed the quality of materials, stitching, and overall construction to ensure the utmost durability and comfort.
