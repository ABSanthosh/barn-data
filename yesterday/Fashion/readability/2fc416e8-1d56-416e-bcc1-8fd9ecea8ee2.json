  "description": "Sneakers get their fair share of fashion love, but there’s one version that stands the test of time as a shoe-rotation regular: the white sneaker. These classic kicks are one of the most enduring sneaker trends to date because of their versatility. White sneakers are a year-round staple, but they especially shine in the warmer months — complementing everything from summer dresses to denim shorts. Whether you’re looking for bright-white platform sneakers, timeless tennis shoes to create the perfect dress and sneaker combo or are in need of sleek trainers for outdoor adventures, we’ve rounded up the best styles to cart up right now. Click through to find the best women’s white sneakers — from streamlined, modern styles to chunky, retro designs. DashDividers_1_500x100 White Tennis Shoes Whether you want an old-school pair of slim white sneakers for your vacation (à la Baby in Dirty Dancing) or to actually play tennis in, a pair of white tennis shoes scream “summer.” From bright-white canvas styles to off-white leather and suede versions, you can go as preppy or modern as you like on your next summer outing. DashDividers_1_500x100 White Leather Sneakers Perfect for elevating casual outfits or making your refined looks more relaxed, leather sneakers are versatile, durable, and super chic. Opt for a chunky court style as a goes-with-everything option or try a slim retro runner for a sporty touch. And if genuine leather isn’t your thing, consider faux leather, which also tends to be more affordable and easier to clean. DashDividers_1_500x100 White Platform Sneakers Get an extra boost this summer — without sky-high stilettos — with a pair of platforms. From standard platform soles to extra-stacked styles and even nostalgic wedges, these sneaker options run the gamut from subtle to dramatic. DashDividers_1_500x100  White Designer Sneakers If you’re looking to invest in designer sneakers, there’s no doubt that a white pair will be a classic that you’ll reach for time and time again (and get your money’s worth!). Rep your favorite luxury designer with a logo-heavy design or pick a more demure style that channels quiet luxury. DashDividers_1_500x100 White High-Top Sneakers High-top sneakers are trending this season, so why not get the best of both worlds and buy a crisp white pair? If you love the retro basketball vibe of this style (or have been immersed in “Knicks in six!” chants and want a new pair for game days), high-tops are the ideal choice for you. DashDividers_1_500x100 White Running Sneakers If you’re heading outside to get active this summer, white athletic sneakers are perfect for long walks, hikes, and runs. We’ve rounded up some extra-comfy styles that’ll go the distance and effortlessly transition from workouts to daily errands.  Like what you see?
