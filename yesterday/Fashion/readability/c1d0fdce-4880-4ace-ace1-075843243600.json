Fahrenheit by Dior has been known as one of the best, most masculine scents around for decades. If you’re searching for Dior Fahrenheit reviews, you might know that already. It got a bit of a facelift in 2015, but its leathery roots remain the same; if western era Clint Eastwood squinting at the setting sun were a cologne, it would be Dior Fahrenheit. And we all know how badass Clint is (even the old El Camino version). So what does it smell like? Will it last a whole day? Does it suck or not? I set out to learn all of this, and this Dior Fahrenheit cologne review answers those questions. Spoiler: it’s miles away from sucking. Otherwise, my opening sentence would mean nothing. It’s one of my favorite date night colognes and will last all day, among other reasons. If you’re ready to learn more of the ins and outs of this forever-hot scent, scroll down and see if Dior Fahrenheit is your dream scent. Key Takeaways A complex combination of leather and florals with hints of violet, Dior Fahrehent has a classic yet unique modern masculine scent. This cologne will turn heads and can last all day. Though some may find it too heavy for the dead of summer, the heavy yet enticing aroma makes it perfect for a night out during the cooler months. In This ArticleNotes \u0026 ScentUsageTrend and PopularityWhat We LikeFinal VerdictAlternative OptionsFAQs parfum.hu / Instagram Fragrance Notes \u0026 Scent Top Notes: Nutmeg flower, lavender, cedar, chamomile, mandarin orange, hawthorn, bergamot, and lemon Middle Notes: Violet leaf, nutmeg, cedar, sandalwood, carnation, honeysuckle, jasmine, and lily-of-the-valley Base Notes: Leather, vetiver, musk, amber, patchouli, and tonka bean Dior Fahrenheit is a cologne for men with a rich, warm scent that gives an air of elegance and sophistication. It’s like a deep warm fruity embrace—an undeniably masculine scent that is tough to imitate. Top notes of lavender, chamomile, and bergamot come on warm yet refreshing. Heart notes of lily-of-the-valley, sandalwood, and honeysuckle join the party for a lovely woody scent with floral hints. Finally, the base notes of leather, tonka bean, and vetiver give a masculine warmth and complexity that harmonize blissfully. Keep in mind that some people compare it to petroleum, and who doesn’t love the smell of pumping gas? Kidding, I know that’s an acquired taste. Don’t worry, though, not everyone picks up on the scent profile. Kind of like how some people taste soap when they eat cilantro. It’s just not for everyone. Usage \u0026 Occasion Wearing Fahrenheit is going to get you noticed. No question about that. This is easily one of Dior’s more popular fragrances for men, and it’s not hard to see why. The combination of leather and florals makes it stand out pleasantly. It brings on classic male scents like leather, cedar, and bergamot, then combines them with more modern scents like florals and mandarin orange. In other words, guys of all ages can wear this scent well. As a whole, it’s a very well-rounded fragrance, but it has been said that it can be a tad overpowering in some scenarios. So it may not be your go-to for daily wear in the office, but it’s distinctive enough to work perfectly for a night out. What is a Dior Fahrenheit review without specific seasonal information? I can tell you that it works best in the cooler months, as some find the rich, warm notes of leather and nutmeg are too much for summer. However, the balanced addition of florals does allow it to work all year round despite the heavier notes. Packaging \u0026 Price We both know if you’re buying Dior, you’re looking for luxury items. We also know that luxury items don’t come cheap. Plus, no Fahrenheit by Christian Dior review would be complete without talking about the packaging. If you plan on buying any Dior colognes, expect to spend upwards of $100 or more for a 3.4oz bottle. That said, you can often get 1.7oz Fahrenheit bottles for under the $100 mark. It could get way worse for luxury colognes, but it still isn’t a cheap buy. On the plus side, unless you’re wearing the stuff every day, you can pick up a smaller bottle and be good for a long time. Since it’s a strong scent and you don’t need much of it, it might last longer than other colognes. As for the bottle, it’s attractive, sleek, fairly minimalist, and fitting for the name. A quality look fitting for a name like Dior that tapers slightly like a candle’s flame. The ombre color effect, from light yellow to fiery red and finally deep crimson, is reminiscent of the effects this fragrance can have on your date night—helping bring things from cool and calm to passionate and warm. Trend and Popularity Only great fragrances can last as long as this one has. Jean-Louis Sieuzac and Michel Almairac crafted Dior Fahrenheit in 1988. Countless other men’s fragrances have come and gone, but Fahrenheit remains a favorite option for thousands. Since its debut, Fahrenheit has spawned different editions of its famous aroma, including Fahrenheit 32, Fahrenheit Absolute, and Aqua Fahrenheit. There isn’t time to include all of those scents in this Dior Fahrenheit review, but each Fahrenheit is a fun twist on the original As a general trend, Fahrenheit is long past its moment to be the new best thing, but its modern yet classic scent and longevity give it a steady following that will continue to support it for years to come. With its subtle florals, this scent is a possible option for those looking for a unisex fragrance that leans more masculine. parfume_watch_reviwer / Instagram Sillage and Longevity Dior Fahrenheit has great longevity, allowing it to last from day into night and beyond. This is probably one of the other things that have made it last in the market as long as it has. It’s a scent that just won’t quit on you. This fragrance is present without being in your face. The sillage is also quite substantial. While you won’t be overpowering people in your wake, the lingering scent coming behind you as you move will turn heads in a good way. They may even wonder if James Bond just passed them. What We Like The complexity and nuance of leather with bright florals and cedar with the slight spice of nutmeg results in a head-turning yet classic scent that works in just about any setting. The combination of longevity and great sillage puts in the work, so you won’t need to constantly reapply. A few sprays in the morning, and you’re usually good until night. The complexity of the scent notes makes it perfect for nearly every occasion—it’s a daily driver cologne that just won’t quit. Flaws But Not Deal Breakers The heavy use of leather and other classic masculine scents can make it a little too heavy for the heat. Even with the addition of florals, some find that it is still not enough and choose a lighter scent when the summer months roll in. eaudorangeverte / Instagram What Are Customers Saying About Dior Fahrenheit For the most part, customers love this cologne. At the time of writing this Dior Fahrenheit for men review, it has nearly 5k reviews and 4.7 out of 5 stars. Not too shabby. It hits all the sweet spots for the majority of men who are looking for a mature, masculine cologne. It seems Kenneth agrees—”It’s an old-school masculinity type of scent. I get nothing but compliments.” Again, some people seem to think it smells like an in-use gas pump. Most people don’t get the petrol smell, but just be wary of it. Personally, I could read reviews like this all day: “Have you ever wondered what the pickles aunt B made on the Andy Griffith show smelled like? This is it. It smells like kerosene and cucumbers. We have grown to like it, though. It’s very odd. It smells like a diesel mechanic having a spa day.” Diesel mechanics do deserve spa days, though. I’m happy to report in this Fahrenheit by Christian Dior review that most customers have nothing but positivity for this scent. The overarching consensus was that Fahrenheit is very masculine, enjoyable, and super sexy. However, if you’re new to the cologne world, it might be worth getting a sample size to try it out first. Final Verdict If you’re still with me, I think it’s safe to say my Dior Fahrenheit review proves why you might love this cologne. Even though it can be a powerful scent, and a little heavy for summer, it has an intoxicating aroma that is both unique and classic all at once. Fahrenheit smells like something my dad would love too, and maybe he does, but that’s not a negative at all. It’s just a testament to its versatility. They knew what they were doing with this scent and managed to pull off notes that pull in long-time cologne users and younger guys alike. This fragrance will likely stick around for decades. hafizar_parfum / Instagram Alternative Options Dior Eau Sauvage This is a great option for gents who love the general scent notes of Dior Fahrenheit but want something a little lighter and fresher. It has a similar elegant power but hits a few slightly different notes. The leathery (some say petrol-like) notes are replaced by more floral and bergamot tones. Yves Saint Laurent La Nuit De L’Homme While La Nuit De L’Homme leans more toward a spicy, sensual vibe, it does share the same uplifting citrusy top notes as Fahrenheit. You’ll still get that deep, charismatic feeling from this one. Portrayal Man Amouage  If you loved the woody scent of Fahrenheit but wanted something more aromatic and ozonic, Portrayal Man could work as your daily fragrance for the warmer months. Think masculine forest with alluring floral notes. FAQ Dior Fahrenheit smells like a blast of warm leather, citrus, and deep violet. It’s a scent designed to grab attention and keep it. Some people think the combination smells a little too much like they’re pumping their car full of gas, but it seems like a “cilantro tastes like soap” situation. I myself think it smells excellent. Dior Fahrenheit has some incredible lasting power; some say it’s a fairly safe bet it will stay with you past eight hours, just not as powerfully. A lot of reviews even say you can plan on smelling the leathery goodness for up to 10 hours on average. Several factors go into spotting a fake Dior Fahrenheit. If you couldn’t tell by the rest of this Dior Fahrenheit review, it’s a strong, leathery smell. Before you even open the package, this beast of a scent will be trying to push its way out. You’ll be able to smell that struggle around the package. Just make sure you’re buying from a good source when you pick it up. Places like Nordstrom, Macy’s, and of course, Dior’s own site will always have legit bottles for sale. Amazon is plenty reliable, but make sure you’re buying from a well-reviewed vendor. When buying something often counterfeited like cologne, try to stick with a 95% positive Amazon review rating at minimum. Lower than 90%, and you’re taking a big risk. Keep in mind, if a price seems too good to be true, it probably is. The first iteration of Dior Fahrenheit came out in 1988. After a successful few decades, it got a slight alteration in 2015. This Dior Fahrenheit review is covering the 2015 version (i.e., the one you’re most likely to find). Dior Fahrenheit Review (2024) Intense Scent or Masterpiece?

The combination of leather and florals makes it stand out pleasantly. It brings on classic male scents like leather, cedar, and bergamot, then combines them with more modern scents like florals and mandarin orange. In other words, guys of all ages can wear this scent well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a whole, it’s a very well-rounded fragrance, but it has been said that it can be a tad overpowering in some scenarios.

I can tell you that it works best in the cooler months, as some find the rich, warm notes of leather and nutmeg are too much for summer.

If you plan on buying any Dior colognes, expect to spend upwards of $100 or more for a 3.4oz bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, you can often get 1.7oz Fahrenheit bottles for under the $100 mark. It could get way worse for luxury colognes, but it still isn’t a cheap buy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the plus side, unless you’re wearing the stuff every day, you can pick up a smaller bottle and be good for a long time. Since it’s a strong scent and you don’t need much of it, it might last longer than other colognes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the bottle, it’s attractive, sleek, fairly minimalist, and fitting for the name. A quality look fitting for a name like Dior that tapers slightly like a candle’s flame.

Countless other men’s fragrances have come and gone, but Fahrenheit remains a favorite option for thousands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince its debut, Fahrenheit has spawned different editions of its famous aroma, including Fahrenheit 32, Fahrenheit Absolute, and Aqua Fahrenheit. There isn’t time to include all of those scents in this Dior Fahrenheit review, but each Fahrenheit is a fun twist on the original\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a general trend, Fahrenheit is long past its moment to be the new best thing, but its modern yet classic scent and longevity give it a steady following that will continue to support it for years to come.

At the time of writing this Dior Fahrenheit for men review, it has nearly 5k reviews and 4.7 out of 5 stars. Not too shabby.

Personally, I could read reviews like this all day: “Have you ever wondered what the pickles aunt B made on the Andy Griffith show smelled like? This is it. It smells like kerosene and cucumbers. We have grown to like it, though. It’s very odd. It smells like a diesel mechanic having a spa day.” Diesel mechanics do deserve spa days, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m happy to report in this \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GIL12C?tag=fsb_1120663-20\u0026amp;th=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-lasso-id=\"1161807\"\u003eFahrenheit by Christian Dior\u003c/a\u003e review that most customers have nothing but positivity for this scent.

With its subtle florals, this scent is a possible option for those looking for a unisex fragrance that leans more masculine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1120670\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1120670\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/parfume_watch_reviwer_abottleofdiorfahrenheitontheground.jpg\" alt=\"a bottle of dior fahrenheit on the ground\" width=\"695\" height=\"869\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/parfume_watch_reviwer_abottleofdiorfahrenheitontheground.jpg 1341w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/parfume_watch_reviwer_abottleofdiorfahrenheitontheground-150x187.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/parfume_watch_reviwer_abottleofdiorfahrenheitontheground-320x400.jpg 320w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/parfume_watch_reviwer_abottleofdiorfahrenheitontheground-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/parfume_watch_reviwer_abottleofdiorfahrenheitontheground-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/parfume_watch_reviwer_abottleofdiorfahrenheitontheground-360x450.jpg 360w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/parfume_watch_reviwer_abottleofdiorfahrenheitontheground-300x375.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/parfume_watch_reviwer_abottleofdiorfahrenheitontheground-696x870.jpg 696w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/parfume_watch_reviwer_abottleofdiorfahrenheitontheground-1068x1335.jpg 1068w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 695px) 100vw, 695px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1120670\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CkifTmEjCxI/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-lasso-id=\"1161829\"\u003eparfume_watch_reviwer\u003c/a\u003e / Instagram\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSillage and Longevity\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fahrenheit-Christian-Dior-Toilette-Spray/dp/B000GIL12C?\u0026amp;linkCode=ll1\u0026amp;tag=fsb_1120663-20\u0026amp;linkId=ab66edfdd666c5281416adc0fc9b25c3\u0026amp;language=en_US\u0026amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-lasso-id=\"1161806\"\u003eDior Fahrenheit\u003c/a\u003e has great longevity, allowing it \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-long-lasting-colognes/\" data-lasso-id=\"1222429\"\u003eto last from day into night and beyond\u003c/a\u003e.

At the time of writing this Dior Fahrenheit for men review, it has nearly 5k reviews and 4.7 out of 5 stars. Not too shabby. It hits all the sweet spots for the majority of men who are looking for a mature, masculine cologne. It seems Kenneth agrees—”It’s an old-school masculinity type of scent. I get nothing but compliments.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, some people seem to think it smells like an in-use gas pump. Most people don’t get the petrol smell, but just be wary of it. Personally, I could read reviews like this all day: “Have you ever wondered what the pickles aunt B made on the Andy Griffith show smelled like? This is it. It smells like kerosene and cucumbers. We have grown to like it, though. It’s very odd. It smells like a diesel mechanic having a spa day.” Diesel mechanics do deserve spa days, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m happy to report in this \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GIL12C?tag=fsb_1120663-20\u0026amp;th=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-lasso-id=\"1161807\"\u003eFahrenheit by Christian Dior\u003c/a\u003e review that most customers have nothing but positivity for this scent.

Even though it can be a powerful scent, and a little heavy for summer, it has an intoxicating aroma that is both unique and classic all at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFahrenheit smells like something my dad would love too, and maybe he does, but that’s not a negative at all. It’s just a testament to its versatility. They knew what they were doing with this scent and managed to pull off notes that pull in long-time cologne users and younger guys alike.
