Wearing a trench coat is always a strong fashion choice, able to set you apart from the crowd. But what’s particularly fascinating about the best trench coats for men is their ability to set you apart from the crowd in several different ways, depending on exactly what style you choose to wear. Although you can definitely lean into the Matrix/Metalhead look with a long black leather trench coat, you can also put on a classic Burberry-style trench coat and immediately gain a few sophistication points. But whatever style you choose to go with, the fact that trench coats are incredibly practical in wet and winding weather isn’t in doubt. As someone who’s constantly looking for my umbrella, I can’t tell you how many (probably terrible) colds my trusty trench coat has saved me from getting. I’m excited to get into 8 recommendations for the best trench coats for men over the course of this article. There’s a lot we’re going to cover, so let’s jump right into it. Key Takeaways  I spent a whole lot of hours going through hundreds of different men’s trench coats in order to create this list. It might sound like I’m complaining, but I’m not. I’ve always loved trench coats and have worn more than a few of them, so researching in order to see what’s going on with the latest and greatest styles was a pleasure. Overall, my recommendation for the best men’s trench coat is the Foret Tent Coat. It’s a very modern take on the men’s trench coat, bringing Nordic minimalism and class to the storied type of jacket. I particularly like the single button that’s visible at the top of the jacket, as well as its very well water-proofed cotton polyester blend. If you’re dead set on getting a leather trench coat, then I’d recommend the Decrum Mens Leather Coat. On the other hand, those who are more interested in a classic-looking men’s trench coat can’t go wrong with the BURBERRY Men’s Britton Double Breasted Trench Coat, Short Length. In This Article Our PicksBuying ConsiderationsHow We ChoseWhy Trust Us? Final VerdictFAQs chrisdoddbr / Instagram Best Overall: Foret Tent Coat Why it’s great: Right up at the top of our list, we have the Foret Tent Coat. It’s an incredibly classy coat that is meant to be worn just above the knee. And it’s one that’s really light on the unnecessary details, featuring just one visible button along its front and a couple of smaller ones on the sleeves. Who is this for? Anyone who’s a fan of modern and thoughtful design should really see whether or not they vibe with this highly distinctive men’s trench coat. Flaws but not deal-breakers: Well, the criticism I can see coming is people saying that the jacket is too simple. Although it’s fine to think that, I would say that anyone who does is missing the point the coat is trying to make. Fit: Standard | Material: 65% Polyester,  35% Cotton | Sizes: XS–2XL | Colors: 2 | Waterproof? Yes | Care: Dry Clean Only Best Black Trench Coat: Pangaia Black Organic Cotton Trench Coat Why it’s great:  Pangaia’s bold unisex take on the trench coat is notable for a couple of reasons. First of all, I have to mention that the quality of the organic cotton that this coat is made from is simply out of this world. The second thing I noticed is the absolute functional design approach that the brand took with this jacket. It almost looks like what they’d wear in Squid Game if they wore trench coats, and, perhaps strangely, I really like it. Who is this for? This trench coat will be right up the alley of anyone who likes modern, functional takes on classic styles. Flaws but not deal-breakers: This trench coat stops at the knees, and I can see some people wishing that it was a little bit longer. If that describes you, then you could consider sizing up. Fit: Oversized | Material: 100% Organic Cotton | Sizes: XS–XL | Colors: 1 | Waterproof? Yes | Care: Machine Wash Best Budget: COOFANDY Men’s Wool Blend Coat with Detachable Plaid Scarfs Why it’s great: You often see COOFANDY showing up on FashionBeans best-of lists, and you’ll keep seeing them for the simple reason that they make really affordable yet really great clothes. Their Wool Blend Coat with Detachable Plaid Scarfs is no exception, allowing you to pull off the overcoat look whether you’re on your way into the office or heading up to the country in the autumn. Who is this for? Anyone who wants a simple wool men’s trench coat should consider this product, especially since the manufacturer has a ton of different colors available. Flaws but not deal-breakers: If you’re not a fan of pairing plaid scarves with trench coats, then you will be stuck with an extra bit of fabric lying around. Fit: Standard | Material: 100% Polyester | Sizes: S–3XL | Colors: 20 | Waterproof? No | Care: Hand Wash / Machine Wash Cold Best Luxury: BURBERRY Men’s Britton Double Breasted Trench Coat Why it’s great: Burberry has maintained its status as a luxury brand for well over a century as a result of the quality of their design, materials, and craftsmanship. And their Men’s Britton Double Breasted Trench Coat, Short Length, is a classic that has helped them stay on top. You’ll never look bad wearing this jacket; that’s the simple truth. Who is this for? I’d say that almost anyone could wear this men’s trench coat, except for people who like to keep it more casual and street-friendly. Flaws but not deal-breakers: Getting this jacket will put you back more than a grand. The price is no joke, but it can definitely be worth it. Fit: Tight/Standard | Material: 100% Cotton | Sizes: 38–46 | Colors: 2 | Waterproof? Yes | Care: Hand Wash Cold Best on Amazon: LONDON FOG Men’s Iconic Double Breasted Trench Coat Why it’s great: The classic Burberry trench coat is definitely a tough act to follow, but the  LONDON FOG Men’s Iconic Double Breasted Trench Coat does an admirable job. This Polyester/Nylon jacket does a great job of keeping you comfortable even when the weather is pretty bad. And the double-breasted design just works on a men’s trench coat. Who is this for? If you see keeping you warm as the main job of your trench coat, then this is a great choice. Flaws but not deal-breakers: It has a removable collar, which can help you change up the look of the jacket, but it also does feel a little unnecessary. It’s a nice collar; why take it off? Fit: Standard | Material: 69% Polyester, 31% Nylon | Sizes: 36–60 | Colors: 6 | Waterproof? Yes | Care: Machine Wash Best Everyday: Wantdo Men’s Wool Blend Jacket Stand Collar Windproof Pea Coat Why it’s great: Although you could definitely debate whether this product belongs on this list of men’s trench coats, the fact that it’s a hip-length jacket is enough for me to believe that it’s worthy of consideration here. It looks modern and sleek, and it has enough quilted down filling and windbreaking capabilities to keep you warm in the depths of the winter. Who is this for? I’d recommend this jacket to anyone who’s on the lookout for their next highly dependable and highly fashionable winter jacket. Flaws but not deal-breakers: This jacket definitely isn’t the one for you if you’re looking for a full-length men’s trench coat. Fit: Standard | Material: 80% Terylene, 20% Wool | Sizes: XS–3XL | Colors: 12 | Waterproof? No | Care: Hand Wash Cold Best Leather Trench Coat: Decrum Men’s Leather Coat Why it’s great: The leather trench coat is the most attention-grabbing version of the full-length jacket. The Decrum Mens Leather Coat ensures that what you’re wearing actually justifies the attention. It features a really simple design that lets the high-quality lambskin leather it’s made from steal the show. Who is this for? Well, this one is pretty obvious: this jacket is for someone who really wants to get a leather trench coat. Flaws but not deal-breakers: It’s not the kind of jacket that you can wear anywhere since it makes so much of a statement, but it’s great to wear to those places where it makes sense. Fit: Standard | Material: 100% Lambskin Leather | Sizes: XS–3XL | Colors: 1 | Waterproof? No | Care: Dry Clean Only Best Military Trench Coat: Capra Mount Men’s WW2 German Military Real Leather Trench Coat Why it’s great: Last but not least, we have the Capra Mount Men’s WW2 German Military Real Leather Trench Coat. It’s a nod to the military heritage of the trench coat and features a really cool combination of leather and faux fur lapels. Who is this for? If you’re interested in wearing throwback fashion (and perhaps getting an odd look or two), then this just might be the perfect men’s trench coat for you. Flaws but not deal-breakers: I would definitely prefer some real fur over the synthetic stuff, but it still looks and feels very good. Fit: Oversized | Material: Fur, Leather, and Viscose | Sizes: XS–4XL | Colors: 2 | Waterproof? No | Care: Hand Wash Only londonfogbrand / Instagram What Makes The Best Trench Coats for Men? History Some articles of clothing have a special place in the men’s fashion world as a result of their history, and the trench coat is definitely one of those. The long coats were invented more than a hundred years before WWI, but they were popularized (and picked up their name) when the British army started equipping their men with them to help deal with the realities of fighting in trenches. Since then, they’ve ebbed and flowed in terms of how stylish they’re seen as (not to mention adorning the shoulders of countless movie detectives), but they’ve never gone anywhere. Material As you can tell from our list of the best trench coats for men, modern trench coats are made from a wide variety of different materials. Many of the men’s trench coats on the list contain primarily synthetic materials (such as our top pick, the Foret Tent Coat), and there’s nothing wrong with that in this context. After all, trench coats’ primary function is to keep the weather out and keep you warm, so I wouldn’t say that a “natural fibers only” stance makes a lot of sense. That being said, some of the coats on this list are made from materials like cotton (the Pangaia Black Organic Cotton Trench Coat, specifically) and wool (Wantdo Men’s Wool Blend Jacket Stand Collar Windproof Pea Coat). I can’t really pick out any specific material that’s best for a men’s trench coat, as what’s best for you will really depend on the type of weather you plan on wearing it in. Fit \u0026 Rise Lastly, you need to consider how you’d like your new trench coat to fit and how low you’d like it to hang down. Some people would say that a jacket has to reach below the knees to even start being considered a trench coat, but that’s a little bit too picky for me. I think that shorter trench coats, ending mid-thigh, also have a place on this list. In general, if you want to increase how tall you look, then a longer jacket is your best bet, but if you’re already tall, then a shorter trench coat can help add some balance to your profile. Additionally, you’ll have to make a decision about how tight or loose-fitting you want your trench coat to be. There aren’t really any rules of thumb here, though, since both ways of wearing a trench coat can look really great. View More On Foret How We Chose I view a jacket like a trench coat as an investment, which means that I put a lot of pressure on myself to deliver recommendations and advice that can help FashionBeans readers make a good investment. That involves everything from evaluating the quality of a jacket’s materials to giving some pointers about what you could wear with a given product. In terms of the best trench coats for men, I tried to give people a range of choices instead of just recommending several jackets that all look more or less the same. I also paid close attention to the following three factors that we often use to evaluate products here on FashionBeans. Brand Reputation: Whether I’m looking at a product from a long-established brand with tons of history or at a relative newcomer, I always ensure that they have a reputation for creating quality products. Design: As a fashion writer, I have to use my judgment to evaluate whether a trench coat has something unique or interesting about it. Otherwise, it’s hard for me to say that it really has to be in your closet. Price: Finally, although many of the products on this list are a little bit pricey, I always make sure that each product possesses enough value to justify how much it costs. Why Trust Us? Well, the best reason you have to trust the FashionBeans editors is the fact that we’re a collection of men who are obsessed with style and fashion. It’s all we talk about, and each of us has our own special area of knowledge that we can hold forth on the longest. As a result, whether we’re writing about trench coats or anything else in men’s fashion, there’s a member of our team who’s an expert. You can take a look at some of our other work if you still need convincing (like this article on the best gilets for men, this guide to leather jackets, or this roundup of the best men’s bomber jackets). We also use a finely honed process to put together articles like this one, using collaboration to ensure that we make the best possible use of our combined experience. It works like this: first, we all make a personal shortlist of our favorite products in a given category (trench coats in this case), and then we have an all-hands-on-deck meeting to figure out what the final version of the list should look like. It can definitely take some time, but we feel that it always leads to lists that we can really be proud of. Final Verdict Overall, we’ve rated the Foret Tent Coat as the best trench coat for men that’s out there. If you ask me, it deserves the top spot on the list because it’s one of the freshest and most interesting designs I’ve seen in the trench coat category for years. The Foret Tent Coat is an attempt to strip away everything that’s not essential to being a trench coat. It’s a great success, since the brand has created something that looks absolutely amazing. FAQ Yes, trench coats are an excellent wardrobe staple for men during the fall and winter months. Trench coats are one of those types of jackets that have a ton of different styles that you can choose from, from the businesslike beige raincoat to the edgy ankle-length leather coat. That means that a great trench coat can be a wardrobe staple for a wide variety of men with different styles and tastes. You always need to have a little luck to be able to get your hands on a great vintage trench coat for men, either by finding one on an online marketplace like Ebay or coming across one in real life at a thrift store. If you’re willing to put some time into finding the perfect vintage trench coat for you, I’m sure you’ll eventually get lucky. As is the case for many other fashion items, the best color for a trench coat is black. That’s just how it is. However, if you want to go with a different color (or if you already have a black trenchcoat in your closet), both dark brown and beige are really great options.",

The long coats were invented more than a hundred years before WWI, but they were popularized (and picked up their name) when the British army started equipping their men with them to help deal with the realities of fighting in trenches. Since then, they’ve ebbed and flowed in terms of how stylish they’re seen as (not to mention adorning the shoulders of countless movie detectives), but they’ve never gone anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaterial\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you can tell from our list of the best trench coats for men, modern trench coats are made from a wide variety of different materials. Many of the men’s trench coats on the list contain primarily synthetic materials (such as our top pick, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/fsb/gyzg8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eForet Tent Coat\u003c/a\u003e), and there’s nothing wrong with that in this context. After all, trench coats’ primary function is to keep the weather out and keep you warm, so I wouldn’t say that a “natural fibers only” stance makes a lot of sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, some of the coats on this list are made from materials like cotton (the \u003ca href=\"https://pangaia.com/products/mens-cotton-trench-coat-black\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ePangaia Black Organic Cotton Trench Coat\u003c/a\u003e, specifically) and wool (\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J1Z2SSM?\u0026amp;linkCode=ll1\u0026amp;tag=fsb_1180070-20\u0026amp;linkId=ca1f7baa1c20383c6530c0a5b10d011e\u0026amp;language=en_US\u0026amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eWantdo Men’s Wool Blend Jacket Stand Collar Windproof Pea Coat\u003c/a\u003e). I can’t really pick out any specific material that’s best for a men’s trench coat, as what’s best for you will really depend on the type of weather you plan on wearing it in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFit \u0026amp; Rise\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLastly, you need to consider how you’d like your new trench coat to fit and how low you’d like it to hang down. Some people would say that a jacket has to reach below the knees to even start being considered a trench coat, but that’s a little bit too picky for me. I think that shorter trench coats, ending mid-thigh, also have a place on this list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, if you want to increase how tall you look, then a longer jacket is your best bet, but if you’re already tall, then a shorter trench coat can help add some balance to your profile. Additionally, you’ll have to make a decision about how tight or loose-fitting you want your trench coat to be. There aren’t really any rules of thumb here, though, since both ways of wearing a trench coat can look really great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1180074\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1180074\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/fsb/1imse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/foretstudio_manwearingatrenchcoatbyforet.jpg\" alt=\"man wearing a trench coat by foret\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/foretstudio_manwearingatrenchcoatbyforet.jpg 800w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/foretstudio_manwearingatrenchcoatbyforet-150x188.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/foretstudio_manwearingatrenchcoatbyforet-320x400.jpg 320w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/foretstudio_manwearingatrenchcoatbyforet-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/foretstudio_manwearingatrenchcoatbyforet-360x450.jpg 360w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/foretstudio_manwearingatrenchcoatbyforet-300x375.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/foretstudio_manwearingatrenchcoatbyforet-696x870.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1180074\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/fsb/1imse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eView More On Foret\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"i-choose\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow We Chose\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI view a \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/cool-jackets-for-men/\"\u003ejacket\u003c/a\u003e like a trench coat as an investment, which means that I put a lot of pressure on myself to deliver recommendations and advice that can help FashionBeans readers make a good investment.

It works like this: first, we all make a personal shortlist of our favorite products in a given category (trench coats in this case), and then we have an all-hands-on-deck meeting to figure out what the final version of the list should look like. It can definitely take some time, but we feel that it always leads to lists that we can really be proud of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"fin-ver\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinal Verdict\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, we’ve rated the \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/fsb/gyzg8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eForet Tent Coat\u003c/a\u003e as the best trench coat for men that’s out there. If you ask me, it deserves the top spot on the list because it’s one of the freshest and most interesting designs I’ve seen in the trench coat category for years. The Foret Tent Coat is an attempt to strip away everything that’s not essential to being a trench coat. It’s a great success, since the brand has created something that looks absolutely amazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"custom_faqs\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFAQ\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, trench coats are an excellent wardrobe staple for men during the fall and \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-winter-jackets-men/\"\u003ewinter\u003c/a\u003e months.
