Now She’s in the Wimbledon Final.The 23-year-old star could be the first American woman to win the tournament since 2016.

Instead, after announcing in 2023 that she would be taking an indefinite break from being a professional athlete, she decided to sample life as an ordinary 20-something. That self-imposed sabbatical may have been more restorative than anyone could have envisioned.“When I took my break, a lot of people told me that you would never make it to the top again if you take so much time away from the game,” Ms. Anisimova said at a news conference on Thursday after she defeated the world No. 1, Aryna Sabalenka, in their semifinal match. “Because I did want to come back and still achieve a lot and win a Grand Slam one day.”As a teen, she climbed the junior rankings by working immensely hard at the game. She even won the 2017 U.S. Open junior title by beating another talented young American — Coco Gauff, now the reigning French Open champion.ImageIn May 2023, Ms. Anisimova announced an indefinite break from tennis.
