This past week, Zimmermann hosted a chic gathering of friends, family, and VIPs on the island to celebrate the opening of its new flagship boutique. Notable guests included Emma Roberts, Laura Harrier, and Olivia Wilde, who took us along as she got ready.The excursion embodied the best of Greek living. Upon arrival, festivities kicked off with an intimate dinner at Sea Satin Market, a waterfront tavern located directly under the famous Mykonos windmills. The following the day, guests gathered once again for a seaside lunch—this time at the iconic Spilia restaurant, where they lounged and celebrated well into the evening against a sunset backdrop and sounds by DJ Mimi Xu. For Wilde, the trip was as perfect as a spontaneous summer getaway can get. “I had a great time in stunning Mykonos with the Zimmermann team, and all their gorgeous, fun guests,” the actress and director exclusively tells ELLE. “We laughed so hard, ate and drank so well, and wore extremely good looks. It was the most gorgeous 24-hour adventure I’ve had in a long time.”During the main event at Spilia, Wilde looked statuesque, sporting a low-cut flowing black gown with a drop waist that moved perfectly in the coastal winds, ideal for kicking off her shoes on the sandy beaches and dancing the night away. Both the bronze glam and golden jewelry evoked the radiance of a Greek goddess, completing the island vision.See How Olivia Wilde Gets Ready With Zimmermann",
