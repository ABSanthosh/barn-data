Despite living in an age of modern technology, with smartwatches and fitness trackers, there’s always a place for analog timepieces in your wardrobe. Yet, it can be hard to determine which brand offers the best product and value for you. You don’t want to go too cheap, because it’s pretty much inevitable that the watch will start falling apart long before you want it to. Yet, you also don’t want it to be too expensive because the product will never be able to meet its high expectations. This makes it crucial to find the sweet spot between affordable and high-quality, which is why you need to check out Nordgreen. In This ArticleAbout The BrandOur Best SellersFinal Thoughts nordgreenofficial / Instagram About The Brand  Nordgreen is a modern watch brand based out of Copenhagen, Denmark. Since 2017, this brand has been crafting high-quality watches inspired by the Scandinavian way of life. This results in a blend of functional minimalism and understated luxury, all beginning in the design process. The mastermind behind Nordgreen’s product line is award-winning designer, Jakob Wagner. For over 25 years, Wagner has been funneling his passion for elegant, user-friendly designs into all kinds of products. It’s this very mindset that has shaped the identity of Nordgreen’s watches, and it’s why the brand has been recognized for several Red Dot Design Awards. Nordgreen also heavily prioritizes sustainability, not just in regard to the environment but in its products as well. This brand makes massive efforts to minimize waste, recycle materials, and track carbon emissions. So it’s safe to say buying from Nordgreen will be a guilt-free decision for many. The best news yet is that Nordgreen is currently offering a massive sale on all of its best-selling watches. You can pick up the Guardian for 50% off in addition to the Native, Philosopher, and Pioneer watches for 30% off. So, let’s take a quick look at each of these options to see which style might suit you best. Guardian nordgreenofficial / Instagram As Nordgreen’s flagship timepiece, the Guardian holds nothing back in terms of functionality and luxury. Every decision within the design process was reached through extensive scientific research—resulting in the best watch possible. This is reflected in the avid attention to detail and choice of materials. Both the outer case and H-link bracelet are made from 85% recycled stainless steel, which has high corrosion resistance. The flat sapphire crystal glass display is equally durable—able to effortlessly minimize scratches and superficial damages. This watch features 10 ATM water resistance, which means it can endure depths up to 100 meters. Not to mention, it’s powered by a Miyota Premium Automatic 9039 movement for long-term functionality. This combination of high-quality components is what allows this watch to live for up to a century. The Guardian is available in a single style, featuring a silver finish, white dial face, and H-link bracelet. That being said, you do have the choice between two different sizes: 36MM and 40MM. As Nordgreen puts it, “The Guardian is more than just a watch—it’s a movement, a way of living.” Native nordgreenofficial / Instagram The Native watch signifies elegance through simplicity. This is the slimmest watch Nordgreen offers—perfectly embodying all aspects of minimalism. Not to mention, this is also the most affordable watch in the men’s lineup. To start, the streamlined and lightweight case sits just above the lugs for a comfortable fit at all times. On the dial, the minute marks are only visible under direct light, giving it an effortlessly simple aesthetic. The Native also features 3 ATM water resistance, which means you can bring it along for every summer pool party without a second thought. This watch is also powered by a Miyota GL22 movement, offering excellent reliability and consistency. The Native is available in a variety of case finishes, including silver, gold, and rose gold—there are also a handful of dial colors to choose from. You can pick it up with several different strap options, including Italian leather, vegan leather, stainless steel link, and stainless steel mesh. Philosopher nordgreenofficial / Instagram As the name suggests, the Philosopher is a sophisticated timepiece designed with precision and intentionality. This watch evokes subtle elegance and versatility for a variety of occasions to help you live life to the fullest. It starts with the timeless silhouette, featuring a conical case and lugs that hold it up, “like foundations of trust.” The hardened mineral and sapphire crystal display is also classy yet extremely durable. Not to mention, the asymmetrical second hand, which is symbolic of the constant division between past and present. Of course, the Philosopher also has 3 ATM water resistance—for showers, light swims, and most other daily activities. Internally, it’s powered by the Japanese quartz movement, Miyota GM12-3H. The Philosopher is available in several classy case finishes that can be paired with pretty much every strap style Nordgreen offers. You can also pick this watch up in either a 36MM or 40MM diameter. Pioneer nordgreenofficial / Instagram The Pioneer is a versatile yet refined timepiece to perfectly complement your style. This watch is Nordgreen’s take on a classic chronograph with some signature details added to make it stand out in a crowd. The domed sapphire glass watch face leads to a unique silhouette and adds to the overall durability of this piece. The Pioneer also features several sub-dials and a stopwatch function to track performance. Despite how much information this watch can provide you, the design still feels uncluttered and elegant. The Pioneer offers 10 ATM water resistance which will help it endure some of the most adventurous lifestyles out there. The Miyota 6S21-6H quartz movement system is also the gold standard, manufactured directly in Japan. The Pioneer is offered in a single diameter size—42MM.  You can get the case in finishes of silver, gold, and gunmetal. It’s also compatible with most of the Nordgreen strap styles (including a Vegan Nato strap option). Final Thoughts Nordgreen understands that watches are more than just tools for telling time—they’re symbols of expression. This philosophy has influenced Nordgreen’s products and it’s the reason these timepieces feel so unique compared to everything else on the market. If you’ve been meaning to pick up a new watch, now might finally be the time to do so. Nordgreen’s massive sale makes it easier than ever to upgrade your style with a new classy timepiece.
