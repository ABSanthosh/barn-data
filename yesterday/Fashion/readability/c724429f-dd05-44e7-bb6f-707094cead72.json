As any guy will tell you, a good pair of underwear can make or break your mood for an entire day. No matter how comfy the rest of your outfit is, nothing makes a guy grumpier than a constricted pair of gonads. For the common good of me and my fellow men, I committed to putting together the ultimate Saxx review. It doesn’t take much technical expertise to feel if a pair of underwear is good for you, but it doesn’t hurt, either. On the other hand, getting it wrong certainly can hurt. Thankfully, Saxx comes with some nifty comfort features, personally researched and tested by yours truly. Without further ado, let’s jump into our Saxx underwear review and find your ideal pair of underwear. In This ArticleHow We Tested About The ProductBuying ConsiderationWhy It's GreatHow To Use ItFlaws But Not DealbreakersAlternativesWhy Trust UsVerdictFAQs saxxunderwear / Instagram How We Tested To put together this Saxx review, we put their underwear through a rigorous testing system. First and foremost, we thoroughly researched every marketing claim that the company has made since its inception, and we ran it against the claims made by its main competitors. We looked into comfort, design, durability, and proprietary features to ensure that the brand’s quality output matches its public image. Then, we spent a considerable amount of time with various Saxx products, and we took careful note of the key differences between each option. From there, we kept tabs on how easy they were to maintain, as well as how they stood up to washing machine rough-and-tumble. Measurements I’m around 5 foot 11, and my pants inseams tend to range from 30 to 32 inches. Whenever I put on some weight (which happens more often than I’m willing to admit), my upper legs tend to be the first to swell up, so the thought process behind buying legwear has always been more complicated for me. Either way, it’s served me well in putting together a Saxx review. TL;DR After testing out six different products for our underwear guide, I can say that I’m very impressed by what Saxx brings to the table. Of all the underwear I’ve tried, this is probably in the top three in terms of comfort, which counts for a lot in this niche. Their DropTemp Cooling Mesh and Ultra Super Soft Briefs are the standouts for me, as they effortlessly blend everything that makes Saxx great. In over two weeks of testing, I can’t think of a single wardrobe malfunction or moment of discomfort with either product. The former wins out for me, though, since I prefer how it feels on my thighs. Besides the price, which is totally understandable given the number of features, I do have some nitpicks. I was warned that I could expect damage after a few washes, and there were definitely traces of that. Still, this is par for the course with boxer briefs, especially if you’re constantly on the move. This is a Saxx review, but such is true for other brands as well. Ultimately, if they’re within your budget, I have no trouble recommending this brand of underwear to any guy who values the family jewels. About Saxx Underwear By and large, Saxx underwear is made of premium-grade cotton, paired with reliable cooling technology for year-round comfort. The DropTemp Cooling Mesh briefs are the best example of this, with its odor- and sweat-resistant mesh panels keeping you cozy throughout the day. If you’re a bit more sensitive in the thigh area, their Ultra Super Soft briefs boast a four-way stretch and a nifty zipper opening. They achieve their supreme softness thanks to the viscose, a material renowned in the undergarments game for its unparalleled comfort. Then there’s the Saxx Training Short, whose longer inseam helps keep everything in place while you strut your stuff at the gym. The most iconic feature of all Saxx products is their BallPark pouch. I trust that I don’t have to spell it out to you: long story short, this proprietary anti-chafing technology gives your privates a lot of breathing room. Anyone can appreciate this kind of “hammock” design, especially in the summertime. saxxunderwear / Instagram What To Consider Before Buying As far as performance goes, you’re paying for a premium product by most metrics. With that in mind, it’s far from the cheapest underwear that you can find, but you do get a lot out of the deal, so you won’t hear me complaining. Also, keep in mind that Saxx underwear is… showy, to say the least. It might be a selling point for a lot of people, but you may or may not be a fan of the accentuated pouch. This goes double if you plan on wearing these at the gym and you need to undress in front of other people. It doesn’t get more honest than that in this Saxx review. Why It’s Great A lot of spandex boxers feel tight around the thighs, but that’s not the case here. If there’s one thing that you take away from our Saxx review, let it be this: anyone who’s endowed below the belt (front or back) will feel extremely comfortable wearing these, and that’s a fact. All of that is complemented by the fact that you can find them in just about any size. If you like the feel of Saxx, you never have to worry about compromising on size ever again. This is especially true for their CoolTemp briefs, which are as far removed from discomfort or tightness as you can get. How To Wear It Despite the pouch, you don’t have to do any special sizing rituals with these. The only part here that (quite literally) sticks out is the pouch, and it’s all nicely compressed by whatever legwear you’ve got on. There isn’t a huge break-in period with these, either, and that goes for most of their products. After a couple of wears and a single wash, these will feel more like part of your skin than a layer of clothing. saxxunderwear / Instagram Flaws But Not Deal-breakers Keeping it real here for this Saxx underwear review: there’s a downside, and that’s the durability. Users report holes around the thigh area after relatively little use, and I did notice a small tear in the leg opening on a single pair myself. That said, a lot of this comes down to care and maintenance. How To Care For Saxx Underwear You’ll want to wash these in cold water and with a low tumble setting. The tradeoff to comfort is the relatively thin construction, so avoid high-cycle settings on your washing machine and you should be good. Since they’re so good at handling sweat, you can imagine that they dry very quickly. If the weather is nice, you can air them out after washing and have them ready to go in hours flat. You won’t have to worry about them stretching out, either, which is always a plus. saxxunderwear / Instagram You Have Options (Saxx Alternatives) This is a Saxx review, but we always offer you other options. For a product that fills a similar enough niche at a slightly more approachable price, Fruit of the Loom have some great picks that you might want to check out. These aren’t exactly pouched per se, but they offer a lot of breathability if you can get the sizing just right. Best of all, you can get them in large bundles and stockpile for a good long while. The downside is these just don’t handle sweat the same way – to be fair, though, few Saxx competitors do. Then there’s UNDZ, another brand that’s generous around the private area and won’t burn a hole through your wallet. I have a history with these, and although they’re pretty good at accommodating guys of different thigh sizes, they don’t feel quite as breathable. Also, their designs are a bit on the funky side, so it’s a love-it-or-hate-it option in that sense. Why Trust Us Like any other guy, comfort is one of my number one considerations when it comes to underwear. With that in mind, the last thing I’d do is steer my fellow dudes wrong when it comes to their privates. For this Saxx underwear review, I tested half a dozen of their products myself before delivering a verdict. If I don’t get to try out a product for myself, I research far and wide to bring you the finest ones. Whether it’s compression underwear or another garment staple, I rely on customer feedback and thorough research on proprietary technology to get a feel for what the product offers. Verdict And that wraps up our Saxx review. These boxers passed our vibe check with flying colors: their comfort is out of this world, and their patented technology wicks away sweat and odor like it’s nobody’s business. The gold medal has to go to their DropTemp Cooling Mesh Briefs, which combine the best Saxx features with a reasonable price. FAQ Yes, Saxx underwear is some of the finest private-parts-friendly underwear on the market today. Your assets will have plenty of breathing room, you’re unlikely to work up a major sweat, and there aren’t any pesky inseams to chafe you where it hurts most. For my money, the waistband on Saxx has an amazing grip without ever feeling constrictive. You won’t have to worry about them rolling up (or down for that matter), and the leg opening doesn’t furl up, either. This makes them a great pick for guys with meatier thighs, especially when you consider the softness on top of that. There’s nothing quite like the BallPark pouch in any other underwear brand, despite what they may claim. The best part is that it isn’t just a visual distinction – it genuinely works and it makes a world of difference for your day-to-day comfort.

It might be a selling point for a lot of people, but you may or may not be a fan of the accentuated pouch.

First and foremost, we thoroughly researched every marketing claim that the company has made since its inception, and we ran it against the claims made by its main competitors. We looked into comfort, design, durability, and proprietary features to ensure that the brand’s quality output matches its public image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, we spent a considerable amount of time with various Saxx products, and we took careful note of the key differences between each option. From there, we kept tabs on how easy they were to maintain, as well as how they stood up to washing machine rough-and-tumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMeasurements\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m around 5 foot 11, and my pants inseams tend to range from 30 to 32 inches. Whenever I put on some weight (which happens more often than I’m willing to admit), my upper legs tend to be the first to swell up, so the thought process behind buying legwear has always been more complicated for me.

Of all the underwear I’ve tried, this is probably in the top three in terms of comfort, which counts for a lot in this niche.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir DropTemp Cooling Mesh and Ultra Super Soft Briefs are the standouts for me, as they effortlessly blend everything that makes Saxx great. In over two weeks of testing, I can’t think of a single wardrobe malfunction or moment of discomfort with either product. The former wins out for me, though, since I prefer how it feels on my thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides the price, which is totally understandable given the number of features, I do have some nitpicks. I was warned that I could expect damage after a few washes, and there were definitely traces of that. Still, this is par for the course with boxer briefs, especially if you’re constantly on the move. This is a Saxx review, but such is true for other brands as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, if they’re within your budget, I have no trouble recommending this brand of underwear to any guy who values the family jewels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"about\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Saxx Underwear\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BNXC93C6?\u0026amp;linkCode=ll1\u0026amp;tag=fsb_1180189-20\u0026amp;linkId=6a655ef95a4eb0f86fb1d65a69a65eea\u0026amp;language=en_US\u0026amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DropTempCoolingMesh_SaxxReview.jpg\" alt=\"Saxx Drop Temp Cooling Mesh Boxer Briefs\" width=\"333\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DropTempCoolingMesh_SaxxReview.jpg 679w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DropTempCoolingMesh_SaxxReview-150x158.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DropTempCoolingMesh_SaxxReview-380x400.jpg 380w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DropTempCoolingMesh_SaxxReview-428x450.jpg 428w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DropTempCoolingMesh_SaxxReview-300x315.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nBy and large, Saxx underwear is made of premium-grade cotton, paired with reliable cooling technology for year-round comfort. \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BNXC93C6?\u0026amp;linkCode=ll1\u0026amp;tag=fsb_1180189-20\u0026amp;linkId=6a655ef95a4eb0f86fb1d65a69a65eea\u0026amp;language=en_US\u0026amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eThe DropTemp Cooling Mesh\u003c/a\u003e briefs are the best example of this, with its odor- and sweat-resistant mesh panels keeping you cozy throughout the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re a bit more sensitive in the thigh area, their \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GH4XK3T?\u0026amp;linkCode=ll1\u0026amp;tag=fsb_1180189-20\u0026amp;linkId=b30e0b8ac7d2750f6a188cacbdb9a641\u0026amp;language=en_US\u0026amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eUltra Super Soft\u003c/a\u003e briefs boast a four-way stretch and a nifty zipper opening.

It might be a selling point for a lot of people, but you may or may not be a fan of the accentuated pouch.

These aren’t exactly pouched per se, but they offer a lot of breathability if you can get the sizing just right. Best of all, you can get them in large bundles and stockpile for a good long while. The downside is these just don’t handle sweat the same way – to be fair, though, few Saxx competitors do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there’s UNDZ, another brand that’s generous around the private area and won’t burn a hole through your wallet. I have a history with these, and although they’re pretty good at accommodating guys of different thigh sizes, they don’t feel quite as breathable. Also, their designs are a bit on the funky side, so it’s a love-it-or-hate-it option in that sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"trust-us\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Trust Us\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike any other guy, comfort is one of my number one considerations when it comes to underwear.
