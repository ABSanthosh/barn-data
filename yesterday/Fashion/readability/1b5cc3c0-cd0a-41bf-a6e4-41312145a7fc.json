  "text": "“Relationships are like shoes: No matter how beautiful they are or how much you love them, if they don’t fit there will be pain with every step. Nobody will know it but you.” — Karleen Chiu, “Relationships Are Like Shoes,” Tiny Love Stories, March 19, 2019 “Affairs are one of the adult world’s few disasters that can be gotten over, with a lot of time and kindness. It has to burn out of you over months and months, flaming up and then subsiding as you get used to the fact.” — Wendy Plump, “A Roomful of Yearning and Regret” Dec. 9, 2010 “I believe that the most passionate love is experienced by people who embrace the imperfection of their relationship, who see it as a fixer-upper with good bones.” — Oz Johnson, “In Praise of the 10-Percent Wrong Relationship” Nov. 25, 2022 “Romance, I’ve come to learn, is not simply a thing to spend money on. It is the thing to spend money on … The rest, in the end, is just expense.” — David Yoon, “How I Learned to Spend Money on Love,” Dec. 11, 2023 “No love is ever wasted. Even if the love is unrequited. Even if love leads to heartbreak. Even if the relationship doesn’t last. Even if it ends in pain, betrayal or death.” — Kerry Egan, “No Love Is Ever Wasted” March 10, 2023 “I was never terrible at relationships. I was just terrible at pretending to be someone I wasn’t.” — Laura Cathcart Robbins, “Marriage Made an Actor Out of Me,” May 24, 2024 “I’m not sure if we fall in love with people or if we fall in love with the way they make us feel, the ways they expand who we are and wish to be.” — Miriam Johnson, “The 12-Hour Goodbye That Started Everything,” July 21, 2017 “The state of being married is coming to the realization that the person you have pledged your life to is, at heart, a mystery. There will always be things unknown to you.” — Kerry Egan, “Married to a Mystery Man,” Aug. 18, 2017 “For me [single at 34], saying, ‘Congratulations on your engagement,’ is too often another way of saying, ‘Goodbye.’” — Adam Chandler, “Netflix, Cake and S.N.L.,” Tiny Love Stories, Oct. 23, 2018 “Grief does not fade; it lives next to me as I drive, as I create my art, even as I laugh. I am laughing again, just know that.” — Amalia Melis, “My Last Shopping List for Him,” June 23, 2023 “There is no ‘why’ that would ever be a good enough reason for her death. So my only choice was to stop asking.” — Samantha Joseph, “I Had to Stop Asking Why,” April 28, 2023 “I left the place I love for the man I love … Sometimes, the most unconditional of loves are also the most inconvenient.” — Kanika Punwani Sharma, “India Is an Ache,” Tiny Love Stories, June 18, 2019",
