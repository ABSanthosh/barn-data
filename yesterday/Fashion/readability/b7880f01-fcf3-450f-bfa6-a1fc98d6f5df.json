  "description": "If you are a Taylor Swift fan, or have a friend who's a Swiftie (who doesn't?), then you've probably heard she's been spotted on many outings with boyfriend Travis Kelce. So, it might not come as a surprise that her style has taken a romantic turn for date nights and Chiefs games alike. Swift appears to have a newfound affinity for corsetry, sporting both the Victoria's Secret Very Sexy Classic Silk Corset ($35, originally $100) and Fleur du Mal Long Sleeve Flared Corset Dress ($475) in recent history. As someone who's always been intrigued by her aesthetic - skater skirts and leggy co-ords seem to transcend time in Swift's wardrobe - I decided to try out both pieces by constructing inspired street style looks for New York Fashion Week. My goal was to deliver an honest review of her go-to pieces so I reported thoroughly on the features, comfortability, and versatility of both corset designs ahead. Read on to see how I employed Swift's most recognizable styling tricks to determine whether her outfits live up to the hype. Taylor Swift's Victoria's Secret Corset Image Source: PS Photography / Sarah Wasilak and David Eulitt/Getty Images About the Victoria's Secret Very Sexy Classic Silk Corset It comes in coconut white or black as part of a set with an adjustable thong panty. It's available in sizes XS-XL with DD cup size available in small and medium. The corset has boning throughout, front hook-and-eye closures, and an adjustable lace-up back. The straps are elastic and not adjustable. It's made of 100-percent silk with a 100-percent polyamide lining. It should be hand-washed. What I Like About the Victoria's Secret Very Sexy Classic Silk Corset There's no denying that this corset made me feel snatched. I actually can't recall the last time I strapped myself into a proper corset, but this one brought back all the fond memories. I think the satin feel gives this a very elevated look, whether or not you're styling it with clothes. I also really appreciated the flexibility of the elastic straps since the rest of the bodice is so firm and structured. Ultimately, it's the silky sheen that makes this corset Swift-certified for a Chiefs game - she teamed it with red Versace tweed separates, Versace Medusa boots, and a Versace Medusa bag to ideate luxury, along with a Louis Vuitton Tambour watch and ruby jewelry from David Yurman, Effy, and Retrouvaí. I employed the same styling tricks, albeit at a significantly lower price point, and even swiped on Swift's signature red lip using her go-to Ruby Woo shade by Mac. What to Consider Before Buying the Victoria's Secret Very Sexy Classic Silk Corset This corset is not for the faint of heart. It required my boyfriend's full attention as I was unable to tie it myself once I had it in place, and I had to fully loosen all the ribbons to get it over my head. You'll want to reserve at least 10 minutes for this process, and probably tap a friend or partner for help. While it felt firm and not necessarily uncomfortable once it was secured, some folks might describe the corset as restricting, particularly while sitting down. I wore it to a runway show and had it on for a total of about three hours. I definitely breathed an unmistakable sigh of relief when I took it off at the end of the night. Finally, it's important to note that this corset doesn't have adjustable straps, and it's on clearance, so you may want to go for another option (VS recommends the Dare to Dream Lace Strapless Corset and Geo Daisy Lace Deep-V Corset as alternatives) for either of those key reasons. Taylor Swift's Fleur du Mal Corset Dress Image Source: PS Photography / Sarah Wasilak and XNY/Star Max/GC Images About the Fleur du Mal Long Sleeve Flared Corset Dress The dress is available in both black and heather gray in sizes XS-L. The material is soft stretch jacquard with corset seaming throughout. It has a mockneck cut, flare skater skirt with a wavy trim, and exposed back zipper. The dress should be dry cleaned or hand-washed with cold water, then laid flat to dry. It's returnable for a full refund and comes with free shipping since it's over $175. What I Like About the Fleur du Mal Long Sleeve Flared Corset Dress It's hard to find one bad feature of this LBD that Swift wore for a night out with Travis Kelce over the holidays. It's extremely comfortable and you can feel the quality just by the weight of the piece when you're holding it up in front of you. Because of the corsetry woven throughout, the design is extremely flattering and smoothing. It's easy to see why Swift's stylist Joseph Cassell Falconer considered this to be a closet staple when he selected it for her. \"We work with her stylist and know she has a few Fleur du Mal pieces,\" founder Jennifer Zuccarini said. \"I think Fleur du Mal is a perfect fit for [Swift] because her style, similar to Fleur, is more feminine, fashion-forward, and often cheeky and flirty. Over the last couple of years, she seems more comfortable with herself and embracing her sensuality and individuality.\" (Swift also sported the label in her music videos for \"Lover\" and \"You Need To Calm Down.\") For date night, Swift wore the dress under Simkhai's embellished Gianni coat with a fringe Stella McCartney Falabella tiny tote bag, Christian Louboutin platform sandals, De Beers earrings, a Bonbonwhims necklace, and gold Cartier watch. I paid homage to the look with a similar Nasty Gal coat that's now sold out, a Stella McCartney Ryder bag to reflect her love for the designer, and Vivaia sock boots with fitting red soles. I even applied the same Ruby Woo lipstick and added Swift-inspired jewelry to round out the moment. What to Consider Before Buying the Fleur du Mal Long Sleeve Flared Corset Dress While this dress has all the details that comprise a wardrobe essential, it is on the expensive side for a black skater dress, comparatively speaking. If you have pets, make sure you have a lint roller on hand because the material also attracts hair. The Fleur du Mal team notes that the dress sold out as soon as Swift wore it, though it's back in stock now, so if you love it, add it to your cart ASAP. One final note? I own the dress in my regular size (XS), and while it's the perfect length, the sleeves almost feel like added compression - that doesn't bother me at all, but if you prefer a looser fit, my advice is to size up. Where to Buy Taylor Swift's Viral Corsets You can shop the Victoria's Secret Very Sexy Classic Silk Corset on the brand's website and the Fleur du Mal Black Sleeve Flared Corset Dress on the brand's website, or at Shopbop and Farfetch.

I also really appreciated the flexibility of the elastic straps since the rest of the bodice is so firm and structured. \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"4\"\u003eUltimately, it\u0026#39;s the silky sheen that makes this corset Swift-certified for a Chiefs game — she teamed it with red Versace tweed separates, Versace Medusa boots, and a Versace Medusa bag to ideate luxury, along with a Louis Vuitton Tambour watch and ruby jewelry from David Yurman, Effy, and Retrouvaí.

It required my boyfriend\u0026#39;s full attention as I was unable to tie it myself once I had it in place, and I had to fully loosen all the ribbons to get it over my head. You\u0026#39;ll want to reserve at least 10 minutes for this process, and probably tap a friend or partner for help. While it felt firm and not necessarily uncomfortable once it was secured, some folks might describe the corset as restricting, particularly while sitting down. I wore it to a runway show and had it on for a total of about three hours. I definitely breathed an unmistakable sigh of relief when I took it off at the end of the night. Finally, it\u0026#39;s important to note that this corset doesn\u0026#39;t have adjustable straps, and it\u0026#39;s on clearance, so you may want to go for another option (VS recommends the \u003ca href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701743\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.victoriassecret.com%2Fus%2Fvs%2Fsleepwear-and-lingerie-catalog%2F1125875400\u0026amp;xcust=___psv__p_49428844__t_w_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer sponsored\"\u003eDare to Dream Lace Strapless Corset\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701743\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.victoriassecret.com%2Fus%2Fvs%2Fsleepwear-and-lingerie-catalog%2F1126294200\u0026amp;xcust=___psv__p_49428844__t_w_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer sponsored\"\u003eGeo Daisy Lace Deep-V Corset\u003c/a\u003e as alternatives) for either of those key reasons.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"2\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTaylor Swift\u0026#39;s Fleur du Mal Corset Dress\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure data-element-type=\"ParagraphImage\" data-element-index=\"8\"\u003e\u003cpicture data-testid=\"picture-tag\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/zHeCeExRPJQXBdMEfeymypzX7lM=/fit-in/792x792/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2025/02/19/784/n/1922564/tmp_qD332I_1a0c5d4c0b803b3f_Basic_Collage-9-2-Up_Square_1_.png\" width=\"792\" height=\"792\" srcset=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/zHeCeExRPJQXBdMEfeymypzX7lM=/fit-in/792x792/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2025/02/19/784/n/1922564/tmp_qD332I_1a0c5d4c0b803b3f_Basic_Collage-9-2-Up_Square_1_.png 1000w, https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/lF2KOTmbLd9-JzmR6g0QZamgSEY=/fit-in/1584x1584/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2025/02/19/784/n/1922564/tmp_qD332I_1a0c5d4c0b803b3f_Basic_Collage-9-2-Up_Square_1_.png 2000w\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/slwasz/\" data-vars-href=\"https://www.instagram.com/slwasz/\" data-vars-ga-action=\"click\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePS Photography | Sarah Wasilak\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv data-element-type=\"ParagraphBodyText\" data-element-index=\"9\" data-element-has-beginning-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"0\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAbout the Fleur du Mal Long Sleeve Flared Corset Dress\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv data-element-index=\"1\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"false\"\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe dress is available in both black and heather gray in sizes XS-L.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe material is soft stretch jacquard with corset seaming throughout.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt has a mockneck cut, flare skater skirt with a wavy trim, and exposed back zipper.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe dress should be dry cleaned or hand-washed with cold water, then laid flat to dry.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt\u0026#39;s returnable for a full refund and comes with free shipping since it\u0026#39;s over $175.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"2\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat I Like About the Fleur du Mal Long Sleeve Flared Corset Dress\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"3\"\u003eIt\u0026#39;s hard to find one bad feature of this LBD that Swift wore for a night out with Travis Kelce over the holidays.

If you have pets, make sure you have a lint roller on hand because the material also attracts hair. The Fleur du Mal team notes that the dress sold out as soon as Swift wore it, though it\u0026#39;s back in stock now, so if you love it, add it to your cart ASAP. One final note? I own the dress in my regular size (XS), and while it\u0026#39;s the perfect length, the sleeves almost feel like added compression — that doesn\u0026#39;t bother me at all, but if you prefer a looser fit, my advice is to size up. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"2\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhere to Buy Taylor Swift\u0026#39;s Viral Corsets\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"3\"\u003eYou can shop the Victoria\u0026#39;s Secret Very Sexy Classic Silk Corset on the brand\u0026#39;s website and the Fleur du Mal Black Sleeve Flared Corset Dress on the brand\u0026#39;s website, or at \u003ca href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM\u0026amp;mid=42352\u0026amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopbop.com%2Fproduct%2Fvp%2Fv%3D1%2F1556660504.htm\u0026amp;u1=___psv__p_49428844__t_w_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer sponsored\"\u003eShopbop\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701743\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.farfetch.com%2Fshopping%2Fwomen%2Ffleur-du-mal-corset-knitted-dress-item-23394341.aspx\u0026amp;xcust=___psv__p_49428844__t_w_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer sponsored\"\u003eFarfetch\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"4\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eRating\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"5\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVictoria\u0026#39;s Secret Very Sexy Classic Silk Corset\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e ★★★★☆ \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"6\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFleur du Mal Black Sleeve Flared Corset Dress\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e ★★★★★ \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"8\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/author/sarah-wasilak\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSarah Wasilak\u003c/a\u003e (she/her) is the associate director of Shopping at PS.
