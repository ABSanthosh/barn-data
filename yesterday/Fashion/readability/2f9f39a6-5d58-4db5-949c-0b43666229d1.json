Now I'm back with more purpose than ever,\" Preston told Business of Fashion. {Business of Fashion/paywalled}Meta invests in EssilorLuxotticaMeta bought a minority stake in EssilorLuxottica, the world's largest eyewear manufacturer. Meta acquired just under 3% of the Ray-Ban maker, a stake worth around €3 billion ($3.5 billion) at market prices. The tech giant is reportedly considering further investment that could build the stake to around 5% over time. This investment reflects Meta's commitment to the fast-growing smart glasses industry. {Bloomberg/paywalled}SPONSORED: Ulike ReGlow LED Mask, an at-home solution for smoother, brighter and clearer skinPhoto: Courtesy of Ulike ReGlowThe Ulike ReGlow LED Mask has been gaining attention lately, especially among women in their 30s and beyond who are looking for a convenient way to target multiple skin concerns at home. This FDA-cleared device combines four clinically tested wavelengths — red, blue, yellow, and infrared — with 272 high-density LEDs to help address fine lines, uneven tone, breakouts and dullness. Thanks to its four treatment modes, it's easy to adjust based on changing skin needs throughout the month. Many users appreciate its ability to deliver visible results within a few weeks, with smoother, brighter and more balanced skin. Developed with photomedicine expert Dr. Michael Hamblin and backed by strong online reviews, the ReGlow mask is quickly becoming a go-to option for those seeking professional-grade skincare without the time and cost of clinic visits. Ulike's ReGlow Mask is heating up as Prime Day nears, users can save up to $100 from Amazon as well as Ulike’s official store (with code ULIKELED). {Ulike}Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesV\u0026A to show first-ever Schiaparelli exhibition in the U.K.In March 2026, the V\u0026A will open the first exhibition ever staged in the U.K. devoted to Schiaparelli. The exhibit, titled \"Schiaparelli: Fashion Becomes Art,\" will be open from March 21 through Nov. 1, 2026. Spanning the 1920s to the present day, it charts the history and impact of Elsa Schiaparelli and traces the origins of the house to its present-day designs by Daniel Roseberry. The exhibition will comprise over 200 objects, including garments, accessories, jewelry, paintings, photographs, sculpture, furniture, perfumes and archive material. {Fashionista inbox}LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers announces juryPhoto: Courtesy of LVMHLVMH has announced the jury for this year's LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers: Jonathan Anderson, Sarah Burton, Nicolas Ghesquière, Marc Jacobs, Stella McCartney, Nigo, Phoebe Philo, Silvia Venturini Fendi, Pharrell Williams, Delphine Arnault, Jean-Paul Claverie and Sidney Toledano. During the Sept. 3 final, the jury will select from the eight finalists the recipients of the LVMH Prize, the Karl Lagerfeld Prize and the Savoir-Faire Prize. Loewe CEO Pascale Lepoivre will mentor the winners this year. {Fashionista inbox}How L.A.'s fashion community is rebuilding post-fireSix months after the Eaton and Palisades fires, remediation and renovation have begun on some standing buildings in the Palisades, and developers are working to attract businesses back to the affected areas. Palisades Village announced plans to reopen the entire mall a year from now, with Elysewalker confirmed to set up a new flagship. Altadena's main business district is showing some signs of regrowth, though many displaced retailers and salons remain in a holding pattern. {Business of Fashion/paywalled}U.S. tariffs threaten Bangladesh's garment sectorBangladeshi garment workers fear job losses as Donald Trump's 35% tariff on the country threatens orders from its main export market and crimps the country's biggest industry. The garments sector accounts for more than 80% of Bangladesh's total export earnings, employing four million people and contributing roughly 10% to its annual GDP. Trump has said he will impose a 20% tariff on major apparel exporter Vietnam while levies on India and Sri Lanka are yet to be announced. Lower tariffs for these nations will make apparel from Bangladesh costlier in comparison. {Reuters/paywalled}Why marketplaces are driving e-commerce growthMarketplaces drove more than 40% of total e-commerce growth in 2024, per a new report from marketplace and social commerce automation platform Cymbio. The report also found that direct-to-consumer channels drove 25% of e-commerce growth, and Cymbio estimates that marketplaces will drive 53% of growth by 2030. The sheer number of brands on the market can make discovery difficult, so these retailers have become similar to a search engine for boosting brand discovery. {Glossy/paywalled}Fashionista's audience includes 1 million site visitors, 110,000 newsletter subscribers and 4.74 million social media followers.

Palisades Village announced plans to reopen the entire mall a year from now, with Elysewalker confirmed to set up a new flagship. Altadena\u0026#39;s main business district is showing some signs of regrowth, though many displaced retailers and salons remain in a holding pattern. {\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/beauty/las-uneven-road-to-post-fire-recovery/\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBusiness of Fashion\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e/paywalled}\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"u-s-tariffs-threaten-bangladesh-s-garment-sector\"\u003eU.S. tariffs threaten Bangladesh\u0026#39;s garment sector\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eBangladeshi garment workers fear job losses as Donald Trump\u0026#39;s 35% tariff on the country threatens orders from its main export market and crimps the country\u0026#39;s biggest industry. The garments sector accounts for more than 80% of Bangladesh\u0026#39;s total export earnings, employing four million people and contributing roughly 10% to its annual GDP. Trump has said he will impose a 20% tariff on major apparel exporter Vietnam while levies on India and Sri Lanka are yet to be announced. Lower tariffs for these nations will make apparel from Bangladesh costlier in comparison. {\u003ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/after-us-tariffs-jobs-hang-by-thread-bangladeshs-garments-sector-2025-07-09/\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eReuters\u003c/a\u003e/paywalled}\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"why-marketplaces-are-driving-e-commerce-growth\"\u003eWhy marketplaces are driving e-commerce growth\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eMarketplaces drove more than 40% of total e-commerce growth in 2024, per a new report from marketplace and social commerce automation platform Cymbio. The report also found that direct-to-consumer channels drove 25% of e-commerce growth, and Cymbio estimates that marketplaces will drive 53% of growth by 2030. The sheer number of brands on the market can make discovery difficult, so these retailers have become similar to a search engine for boosting brand discovery. {\u003ca href=\"https://www.glossy.co/beauty/marketplaces-drove-40-of-e-commerce-growth-in-2024-according-to-new-report/\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGlossy\u003c/a\u003e/paywalled}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fashionista.com/page/fashionista-advertising\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFashionista\u0026#39;s audience includes 1 million site visitors, 110,000 newsletter subscribers and 4.74 million social media followers.
