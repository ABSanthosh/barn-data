The window units, which are gracefully rounded, have become the air-conditioner of choice for many design-conscious New Yorkers, partly because of their distinctive shape that allows the window to close and light to enter on either side of the unit.Suddenly, the air-conditioner no longer sounded so chic. Ms. Conroy learned about the recall on Instagram, where the handyman who had installed her unit posted to alert his clients.“He was like, ‘I know at least 50 of you have them because I installed them,’” Ms. Conroy, 39, said, laughing.Ms. Conroy, an attorney who lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, said she had purchased the Midea U, which retails for $330 to $480, in 2021 on the recommendation of a friend. Ideally, window units are seasonal devices that are stored in a dry place during the colder months. Ms. Conroy lives in a one-bedroom apartment and, like many city dwellers, does not have the luxury of storage space.When she disassembled her unit after the recall, Ms. Conroy said she found black spots she believed to be mold. She did her best to clean it thoroughly with bleach and paper towels, but said she had not decided what she would do long term.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
