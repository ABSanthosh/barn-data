  "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Kyley Warren Before my recent trip to Iceland, I had to complete one very important task: find a warm jacket comfortable enough for braving the country's often-freezing temperatures. I knew I'd be spending a decent amount of time outdoors in the thick of Reykavik's otherworldly (and notoriously unpredictable) climate, which meant that I'd require an all-weather coat that could handle the unexpected: heavy water exposure underneath waterfalls, wind spells along the country's black sand beaches, and even late-night temperature drops while chasing the Northern Lights. After searching through countless reviews online and sourcing recommendations from friends, I landed (unsurprisingly) on Orolay as the coat brand to entrust with my purchase. The label is known for creating some of the warmest and most durable outerwear on the market, with its famous Thickened Down Jacket amassing over 28,000 ratings on Amazon alone. I decided to try out that style's longer counterpart, the Orolay Thickened Long Down Jacket ($80, originally $150), and can honestly say that in all my years of shopping, I've never found a warmer coat - which is a real testimony, considering I'm known to don multiple layers the moment it drops below 60 degrees. And it's on sale for almost 50% right now. From its packable design (perfect for stuffing into personal carry-ons) to its dopamine-inducing color, I break down what makes this Amazon coat such a worthwhile investment - whether you're wearing it near the Arctic Circle or just in your own backyard. Keep reading for my full Orolay jacket review. What I Like About This Orolay Coat These days, I'm focused more on limiting unnecessary splurges and investing in multifunctional pieces that can work for a variety of occasions and weather conditions. This Orolay jacket ticks all of my boxes and then some; it's crafted from a polyester material that's windproof and waterproof, with an extra-large, adjustable hood that helps to keep my face protected in harsher temperatures. The thickened jacket is filled with 90 percent duck down and 10 percent duck feather, with an insulated design that - per Orolay's website - is suitable for temperatures as low as negative 10 degrees Fahrenheit. The temperatures on my Iceland trip ranged from 25 degrees Fahrenheit to about 45 degrees Fahrenheit, depending on the time of day, and I hardly noticed any temp changes or intense winds because of the comfortability provided by this coat. It's also fitted with unique design flourishes that make it incredibly practical for all-day wear. The coat is completely packable, so it's easy to fold down and squeeze into suitcases or duffel bags without taking up a ton of extra space - despite its thickened down design. The side zipper pockets are remarkably deep and lined with a plush material for extra warmth. I was able to fit everything from a small travel water bottle to a packable umbrella into the pockets, often removing the need for a purse entirely. I also appreciate the style's two-way zipper and button accents, which made it easy to take the jacket on and off whenever going indoors to my hotel or a restaurant. As a fashion girlie through and through, I'm also obsessed with the sunny yellow color of this jacket. The shade is a bit outside of my comfort zone, considering I usually lean heavy into neutrals and more understated tones. But winter can be notoriously gloomy, which is why I decided to opt for something brighter and more mood-boosting. Even if the pastel yellow shade isn't your taste, the waterproof coat is also available in three other colors, including black and white colorways (which I plan to purchase, too). What's Worth Noting My one and only qualm with this long jacket is its pockets, which - despite being deep and offering plenty of carrying space - are situated slightly higher on the coat than other styles, thus creating a somewhat awkward fit when it comes to hand placement. This can be attributed to the depth of the pockets; because they boast a deeper interior that extends farther down, it makes sense to have them situated above the hips as opposed to being front and center on the waistline. I think the pockets are designed more for functionality and are great for holding larger items in a protected (read: zippered) space, especially with products like a smartphone, passport holder, tissues, or even a packable umbrella. But if you're looking for an option that you can comfortably place your hands into whenever they need respite from outside temperatures, I'd recommend shopping for another winter coat. @kyley_warren ‚ÄúYou‚Äù being my trusty Columbia boots, which have supported me through all of my best adventures.

The shade is a bit outside of my comfort zone, considering I usually lean heavy into neutrals and more understated tones. But winter can be notoriously gloomy, which is why I decided to opt for something brighter and more mood-boosting. Even if the pastel yellow shade isn\u0026#39;t your taste, the waterproof coat is also available in three other colors, including black and white colorways (which I plan to purchase, too). \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure data-element-type=\"ParagraphImage\" data-element-index=\"6\"\u003e\u003cpicture data-testid=\"picture-tag\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/WUkW445dA0FKxQRmfOe4eTL7Q4E=/fit-in/792x528/top/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2025/02/20/759/n/1922564/tmp_5soYLc_bf88d121f3b4aee3_Basic_Collage-3-Main_-_1456x970.png\" width=\"792\" height=\"528\" srcset=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/WUkW445dA0FKxQRmfOe4eTL7Q4E=/fit-in/792x528/top/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2025/02/20/759/n/1922564/tmp_5soYLc_bf88d121f3b4aee3_Basic_Collage-3-Main_-_1456x970.png 1000w, https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/wIrWr8r6QjHpYL96P41lIsWYJU8=/fit-in/1584x1056/top/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2025/02/20/759/n/1922564/tmp_5soYLc_bf88d121f3b4aee3_Basic_Collage-3-Main_-_1456x970.png 2000w\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePS Photography | Kyley Warren\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv data-element-type=\"ParagraphBodyText\" data-element-index=\"7\" data-element-has-beginning-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"0\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat\u0026#39;s Worth Noting\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"1\"\u003eMy one and only qualm with this long jacket is its pockets, which ‚Äî despite being deep and offering plenty of carrying space ‚Äî are situated slightly higher on the coat than other styles, thus creating a somewhat awkward fit when it comes to hand placement. This can be attributed to the depth of the pockets; because they boast a deeper interior that extends farther down, it makes sense to have them situated above the hips as opposed to being front and center on the waistline. I think the pockets are designed more for functionality and are great for holding larger items in a protected (read: zippered) space, especially with products like a smartphone, passport holder, tissues, or even a packable umbrella. But if you\u0026#39;re looking for an option that you can comfortably place your hands into whenever they need respite from outside temperatures, I\u0026#39;d recommend shopping for another winter coat.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-element-type=\"ParagraphBodyText\" data-element-index=\"9\" data-element-has-beginning-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"0\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWho Is This Orolay Coat Best For?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"1\"\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re looking for a practical, stylish, and long-lasting jacket that you can trust will be a wardrobe staple for years to come, you can\u0026#39;t go wrong with this Orolay jacket.
