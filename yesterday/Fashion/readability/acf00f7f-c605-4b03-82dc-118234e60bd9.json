Over its 25 years in menswear, contemporary menswear brand Remus Uomo has found its flavour in a sophisticated combination of smart tailoring, striking shirting and distinctive knitwear. It’s possible to quickly gauge the Italian influence on the UK brand’s designs: from the slim silhouettes to the narrow collars and long lines. Each goes together to make for a wardrobe that’s sharp without being stiff. And that’s no easy trick to pull off. But proving that smart-casual clothing can be smart in more ways than one, the brand’s real strength is best appreciated when you look under the bonnet. The use of technically minded fabrics – be it blazers with breathable mesh linings or water-resistant nylon – and the design team’s use of subtle details – textures, trims, the right shade of this or that – can be seen as what sets one of its pieces above the more humdrum. For its spring/summer 2018 collection, the company sought to advance its signature of contemporary clothing, injecting natural materials like cotton, linen and lightweight tweeds with next-level details such as crease-resistant fibres, rubberised buttons and coated zips. The new collection applies this modern design philosophy to wearable pieces like soft-collared shirts and textural knits, flanked by flexible, wear-anywhere blazers and tailored chinos. And it’s never dull: keeping it fresh are bold, nature-inspired prints ranging from camouflage to botanicals, and a clever use of colour, including masculine shades of mauve and navy accented with trims in olive and royal blue. Remus Uomo SS18 Key Picks Slim Fit Lightweight Casual Overshirt An ideal trans-seasonal staple, the overshirt may be an inherently casual piece, but the sharp cut and shirt-style collar of this one from Remus Uomo ensure it also has a smart edge. Plus, made from a water-repellent poly-nylon fabric, it promises to keep you dry in any unseasonal showers, whether worn over a shirt for work or a simple T-shirt. Buy Now Tapered Fit Cotton T-Shirt The humble T-shirt may once have been considered a disposable wardrobe filler, but in 2018 the smarter move is to invest in a style that will go the distance for just about any occasion. Remus Uomo’s cotton example comes not only with a flattering tapered fit, but also the kind of deft touches – a chest pocket, subtle branding and ribbed hems – that take it well beyond the ordinary. Buy Now Slim Fit Printed Cotton Shirt The abstract print on Remus Uomo’s nature-inspired cotton shirt might well be enough to make it a talking point. But then there are all the quality details, too – from the soft collar to the French front and double button fastening, as well as hidden ones like the contrast placket and inners to collar and cuffs. Wear it with black chinos and white sneakers for a monochrome, king-of-the-jungle kinda look. Buy Now Slim Fit Performance Wool-Rich Mix And Match Suit It’s well-known that no wardrobe is complete without a well-fitting navy suit. But the warmer months mean that jackets are regularly packed into weekend bags and thrown onto beer garden benches. Fortunately, Remus Uomo’s performance wool-rich suit is rendered in a crease-resistant fabric as well as being finished with all the standard monikers of good tailoring including slim notched lapels, straight flap side pockets and side vents. Buy Now Slim Leg Cotton-Stretch Chino The fit is just one advantage of these effortlessly stylish chinos: slim through the leg but made from a comfortable cotton-stretch fabric, they make for a style capable of going from workweek to weekend with ease. In addition to being cut like the smartest trousers in your rotation, each pair is garment-washed to give an added softness and ensure they’ll retain their size and shape for seasons to come.

It’s possible to quickly gauge the Italian influence on the UK brand’s designs: from the slim silhouettes to the narrow collars and long lines. Each goes together to make for a wardrobe that’s sharp without being stiff. And that’s no easy trick to pull off. But proving that smart-casual clothing can be smart in more ways than one, the brand’s real strength is best appreciated when you look under the bonnet. The use of technically minded fabrics – be it blazers with breathable mesh linings or water-resistant nylon – and the design team’s use of subtle details – textures, trims, the right shade of this or that – can be seen as what sets one of its pieces above the more humdrum.\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ciframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/peuMSnuVvPo?rel=0\u0026amp;controls=0\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.remusuomo.com/pages/lookbook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-lasso-id=\"609448\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/remus-ss18-img-3.jpg\" alt=\"Remus Uomo SS18 Lookbook\" width=\"490\" height=\"650\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.remusuomo.com/pages/lookbook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-lasso-id=\"609449\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/remus-ss18-img-4.jpg\" alt=\"Remus Uomo SS18 Lookbook\" width=\"490\" height=\"650\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.remusuomo.com/pages/lookbook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-lasso-id=\"609450\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/remus-ss18-img-6.jpg\" alt=\"Remus Uomo SS18 Lookbook\" width=\"490\" height=\"650\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.remusuomo.com/pages/lookbook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-lasso-id=\"609451\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/remus-ss18-img-8.jpg\" alt=\"Remus Uomo SS18 Lookbook\" width=\"490\" height=\"650\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.remusuomo.com/pages/lookbook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-lasso-id=\"609452\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/remus-ss18-img-7.jpg\" alt=\"Remus Uomo SS18 Lookbook\" width=\"1000\" height=\"650\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor its spring/summer 2018 collection, the company sought to advance its signature of contemporary clothing, injecting natural materials like cotton, linen and lightweight tweeds with next-level details such as crease-resistant fibres, rubberised buttons and coated zips. The new collection applies this modern design philosophy to wearable pieces like soft-collared shirts and textural knits, flanked by flexible, wear-anywhere blazers and tailored chinos. And it’s never dull: keeping it fresh are bold, nature-inspired prints ranging from camouflage to botanicals, and a clever use of colour, including masculine shades of mauve and navy accented with trims in olive and royal blue.\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.remusuomo.com/pages/lookbook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-lasso-id=\"609453\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/remus-ss18-img-1.jpg\" alt=\"Remus Uomo SS18 Lookbook\" width=\"490\" height=\"650\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.remusuomo.com/pages/lookbook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-lasso-id=\"609454\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/remus-ss18-img-2.jpg\" alt=\"Remus Uomo SS18 Lookbook\" width=\"490\" height=\"650\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.remusuomo.com/pages/lookbook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-lasso-id=\"609455\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/remus-ss18-img-9.jpg\" alt=\"Remus Uomo SS18 Lookbook\" width=\"1000\" height=\"650\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eRemus Uomo SS18 Key Picks\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSlim Fit Lightweight Casual Overshirt\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn ideal trans-seasonal staple, the overshirt may be an inherently casual piece, but the sharp cut and shirt-style collar of this one from Remus Uomo ensure it also has a smart edge.
