  "description": "While spring officially starts on March 20, we’ve already embraced the slightly warmer and sunnier days, eager for a fresh start (and to pack away our winter wardrobes). From a welcomed return to butter yellow to statement outerwear and not-so-cheesy heart-shaped jewelry, for spring, Refinery29 editors are notably opting for joyful and youthful styles. However, many of us are also looking to functional, versatile, and transitional-weather pieces like do-it-all slouchy bags and work pants to round out our spring outfits. So whether you’re looking for a tried-and-true shoe to get you through every day or a wedding guest dress for special spring soirées, we’ve got recommendations for you. Read on to discover the top spring fashion must-haves that we’re reaching for this season (and think you should, too).All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

Finally, in late November, I managed to snag a pair after a restock, and have been desperately waiting for it to be warm enough to wear them ever since. That time is now! I’m even more in love with them — I feel like an extra in Sofia Coppola’s Marie Antoinette when I wear them. (Note: These are slightly see-through so I suggest wearing tights underneath.) Given that bloomer shorts are having a moment, I’m ready for more bloomer-style pants to shine, especially now that Free People has added some more colorway options, which are also tempting me.” — Esther Newman, Affiliate WriterShop Free PeopleIntimately Forever Young Pants, $, available at Free PeoplePhoto: Courtesy of Esther Newman.Madewell Denim Crewneck Vest \u0026 The Curvy Perfect Vintage Wide-Leg Jean “I loveee a Canadian tuxedo in any iteration, but this vest-jean combo may just be my favorite. I own several vests because they’re a versatile wardrobe staple that can be paired with trousers for the office or shorts for casual plans. And this Madewell denim vest is the best addition to my collection. It has a slight stretch that’s very comfortable and a slightly flared silhouette that gives the illusion of an exaggerated hourglass shape. Plus, the dark wash perfectly matches the brand’s Perfect Vintage Wide-Leg Jean. I typically buy Madewell jeans in “curvy petite” fits, but this pair is just “curvy,” and manages not to swallow up my under-5’3” frame. Together, the vest and jeans are an easy look to put together… and look put-together.The best part? They’re both currently on sale during the Madewell Insiders Event!” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterShop MadewellMadewell Denim Crewneck Vest, $, available at MadewellMadewell The Curvy Perfect Vintage Wide-Leg Jean, $, available at MadewellPhoto: Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.Lululemon Slouchy Sling Bag 6L“Lululemon’s belt bags have been massive for a hot minute now, and I predict this slouchy sling will be the next viral hit. I love the crescent shape, which feels very on-trend, and it holds a surprising amount of stuff despite its smaller size. I was able to fit my umbrella and water bottle in it, in addition to my wallet, phone, and portable power bank. The double-zipped pockets (great for keys and earbuds) are so practical, as is the fact that this style can be converted into a crossbody bag. Did I mention that it's also waterproof?” — Venus Wong, Senior WriterShop LululemonLululemon Slouchy Sling Bag 6L, $, available at LululemonPhoto: Courtesy of Venus Wong.Damson Madder Butter Floral Embroidery Rue Shirt“Thankfully, butter yellow is still in, which is good for me because yellow pops against my tanned olive skin in such a flattering way. As always with Damson Madder, I love the high-quality materials and special touches. There’s subtle red stitching near two of the sleeve buttons, embroidery details on the front, and a pearl button at the neck. I love this oversized top paired with light blue jeans. When it gets warmer, I’ll go with a gingham skirt. It’s also very cute with the brand’s matching butter yellow slouchy bag. Overall, it's the butter yellow shirt to end all butter yellow shirts.” — Tanyel Mustafa, Senior WriterShop Damson MadderDamson Madder Butter Floral Embroidery Rue Shirt, $, available at Damson MadderPhoto: Courtesy of Tanyel Mustafa.Sken Studios Smiley Heart Signet Ring“I am a jewelry magpie. I usually have at least one ring on every finger. (My husband recently said, 'You’ve run out of space on your hands!' to which I vehemently disagreed.) I just love to drench myself in gold shiny jewelry — it makes me feel connected to my Indian heritage. This Sken Studios signet has taken permanent residency upon my forefinger, and so many people have commented on it. I particularly love the smiley face! It brings me so much joy.” — Humeara Mohamed, Contributing Writer Shop Sken StudiosSken Studios Smiley Heart Signet Ring, $, available at Sken StudiosPhoto: Courtesy of Humeara Mohamed.Babaton The Slouch Coat“While I’ve long become a pro at cold-weather dressing (blame it on the almost 20 years that I’ve spent freezing while living on the East Coast), I still find it difficult to find good outerwear for the transitional weather — those days when it’s cold in the morning and warm mid-day. This season, I’ve found my solution in this coat from Aritzia. It’s oversized enough to comfortably fit over sweaters while being lightweight enough to avoid me overheating when it gets warmer (and to carry should I need to take it off). Plus, I love this gray hue, which goes with everything.” — Irina Grechko, Global Fashion DirectorShop AritziaBabaton Coat, $, available at AritziaPhoto: Courtesy of Irina Grechko.Uniqlo Jersey Barrel Pants“I love a barrel-leg pant, and these ones from Uniqlo have quickly become a wardrobe favorite. They’re just the perfect everyday trouser — comfortable yet stylish and versatile. The best part? Uniqlo’s alteration service. I got them hemmed to my desired length at no extra cost and even got them back the same day! For the price point, you really can’t go wrong.” — Kristine Romano, Associate Editor, Photo \u0026 DesignShop UniqloUniqlo Jersey Barrel Pants, $, available at UniqloPhoto: Courtesy of Kristine Romano.Adidas Taekwondo Lace Shoes“Sure, Sambas and Gazelles have been a fan-favorite sneaker for years, but I’m currently loving the under-the-radar Adidas Taekwondo. The slim silhouette and thin sole remind me of a soccer cleat, and I love that sporty look. And while this style is naturally great for athleisure outfits, I’ve also styled them with work separates.” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterShop AdidasAdidas Taekwondo Lace Shoes, $, available at AdidasPhoto: Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.Hill House Home The Dominique Dress“With wedding season back in full swing, I’ve been on the hunt for spring wedding guest dresses that are both pretty and comfortable enough to wear for the all-day occasion. The classic Hill House Home nap dress is what I’ve gravitated to in the past, but I’m very glad I gave the more loose-fitting Dominique style a try. It’s slightly more modest, with a higher neckline and short sleeves shirred at the shoulder seams. This gives a ruffled look that flits and floats with every movement. Combined with the romantic floral pattern, it’s a dress that encapsulates spring perfectly.” — Venus Wong, Senior WriterShop Hill House HomeHill House Home The Dominique Dress, $, available at Hill House HomePhoto: Courtesy of Venus Wong.Dr. Martens Buzz 5-eye Grizzly Leather Shoes“Doc Martens shoes that are comfortable fresh out of the box! I want to shout loud and proud about these bad boys — my latest and greatest obsession. Trust me, I’ve already been stomping around in them plenty to test them out, and I’ve not suffered one blister (all in thin, normal, cotton socks, too, might I add). As a petite gal, I love that these give me all the platform-boosting height that the classic Jadon boots do, but that is a lighter silhouette for spring. At the moment, I’ve been wearing them with jeans, but I can’t wait until it’s warm enough to pair them with my prettiest spring dresses; I love that tough-meets-soft and femme vibe (it makes me think of ‘90s Riot Grrrl and grunge icons like Kat Bjelland and Courtney Love).” — Esther Newman, Affiliate WriterShop Dr. MartensDr. Martens Buzz 5-Eye Grizzly Leather Shoes, $, available at Dr. MartensPhoto: Courtesy of Esther Newman.Mango Silk Blouse with Asymmetrical Neckline“I only got this top a little over a month ago, and I’ve already worn it at least once a week, and brought it to London and Paris Fashion Weeks. Thanks to its voluminous collar and pretty green color, it’s the perfect layer to dress up my go-to pantsuits or throw underneath a leather jacket or coat for a dramatic flourish that doesn’t require much styling (or time getting ready).” — Irina Grechko, Global Fashion DirectorShop MangoMango Silk Blouse with Asymmetrical Neckline, $, available at MangoPhoto: Courtesy of Irina Grechko.Jaded London Osmium Studded Leather Bag “A statement bag is one of my favorite ways to liven up an outfit; thanks to the studded detailing, the leather bag is head-turning while still being subtle enough to be used for the everyday. While you might think the metal hardware would weigh the bag down, it actually feels super lightweight. It also has an adjustable strap and a handy inner pocket. If you’re looking for a spring bag with some edge, this is it.” — Alicia Lansom, Associate EditorShop Jaded LondonJaded London Osmium Studded Leather Bag, $, available at JADED LONDONPhoto: Courtesy of Alicia Lansom.LilySilk Full Bias Cut Silk Pant“I’m all about elevated comfort, and I feel like a silky pant — with an elastic waistband — is the perfect spring transitional style and a wardrobe staple. Although an investment, this navy pair from Lilysilk is high-quality, should last many many years, and makes me feel like I’m wearing pajama pants. Plus, paired with a sweater, button-up, or blazer, these pants could be dressed up for any occasion. I’m now eyeing a pair in black, too.” — Kate Spencer, Sr. Affiliate Partnership ManagerShop LilySilkLilySilk Full Bias Cut Silk Pants, $, available at LilySilkPhoto: Courtesy of Kate Spencer.Jenny Bird Art Heart Button Earrings“I’m really getting into the look of irregular jewelry and asymmetrical fashion. These heart-shaped earrings are a subtle take on that. Hearts can look a bit juvenile to me, but the reversed look makes them feel more grown up and sophisticated. Edgy even. Plus the backs of these are so thick and sturdy, there’s no way they’re going to accidentally fall off while I’m rushing around London.” — Tanyel Mustafa, Senior WriterShop Jenny BirdJenny Bird Art Heart Button Earrings, $, available at Jenny BirdPhoto: Courtesy of Tanyel Mustafa.Never Fully Dressed Reversible Soller Quilted Jacket“This is basically me in jacket form. The colorful, tarot card-like designs? The clashing leopard-print base and contrasting orange trim? The versatility of the reversible wear? I’m obsessed! Even better, this Never Fully Dressed jacket is thin enough to layer up under coats for winter and light enough for spring into summer. I can see myself getting a lot of wear out of this. I’ve already got plans to take it to Glastonbury Festival with me!” — Esther Newman, Affiliate WriterShop Never Fully DressedNever Fully Dressed Reversible Soller Quilted Jacket, $, available at Never Fully DressedPhoto: Courtesy of Esther Newman.Rise \u0026 Fall Cashmere Merino Knitted Hood“None of my favorite jackets or coats have hoods, which is a travesty that seems to haunt womenswear, much like our blatant lack of pockets. While I wait for fashion designers to remember that London is really rather cold and rainy, I’m turning to Rise \u0026 Fall’s cashmere balaclavas — they look chic, keep my hair dry from spring showers, and warm my ears when cycling. Tick, tick, and tick!” — Humeara Mohamed, Contributing Writer Shop Rise \u0026 FallRise \u0026 Fall Cashmere Merino Knitted Hood, $, available at Rise \u0026 FallPhoto: Courtesy of Humeara Mohamed.Núnoo Maxi Dandy Braided Mountain Bag“This is the perfect everyday bag! Not only is it super roomy (it fits my 16” laptop with ease — a rarity), but it also sits comfortably on my shoulder with zero slippage. Made from genuine leather, I know it will last. The woven texture also adds a unique and fun touch to any outfit. It's very quickly become my go-to work bag, and I can easily see it staying in my rotation for seasons to come.” — Kristine Romano, Associate Editor, Photo \u0026 DesignShop NúnooNunoo Maxi Dandy Braided Mountain Bag, $, available at NúnooPhoto: Courtesy of Kristine Romano.Significant Other Coralie Maxi Dress “I’m always wary about ordering maxi dresses online since I’m under 5’3”, but this style actually hits at my ankles, which is a big win. The ribbed knit is very stretchy and comfortable. And while the dress feels lightweight and breezy (making it great for spring weddings and parties), it’s also lined, giving it a thickness that offers some warmth and makes it look expensive.I’ve noticed that the brown appears differently under different lights, but whether it’s more of an olive or chocolate, it achieves that trendy Mocha Moose look. Bonus: The high neckline is a statement in itself, so I don’t have to worry about adding a necklace.” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterShop Significant OtherSignificant Other Coralie Maxi Dress, $, available at Significant OtherPhoto: Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.Shapermint Essentials All Day Every Day Scoop Neck Bodysuit“I had never tried Shapermint before receiving a NYFW survival guide package — and this bodysuit was the most versatile piece for me, since it can also be worn as shapewear. I’ve tried it hidden under a dress for some smooth compression and extra warmth, and also paired with an open blazer and jeans. I’ve worn it with and without a bra, and it works both ways, too. I particularly love this dusty blue color, which makes me want to show it off, so I’m looking forward to styling it with denim shorts and maxi skirts throughout the spring.” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterShop ShapermintShapermint Shapermint Essentials All Day Every Day Scoop Neck Body, $, available at ShapermintPhoto: Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.Like what you see?
