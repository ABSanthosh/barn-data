Key Takeaways Join me as I embark on a journey to discover the best Citizen watch for your wrist. Just kidding, I’ve already done the leg work for you by researching too many models to count.

In This ArticleOur PicksBuying ConsiderationsWhy You Should Trust Us Final VerdictFAQs a_wristed_development / Instagram 1. Best Overall: Citizen Eco-Drive Weekender Watch Why it’s great: With its striking 43mm stainless steel case, bold black face, and three-hand dial, this classic watch has everything you need. Classy with state-of-the-art functionality, it feels timeless yet refreshingly modern. It’s water-resistant up to 100 meters and powered by Citizen’s sustainable Eco-Drive technology which uses light to keep it ticking. When to wear it: One of the main reasons I consider this one of the best Citizen watches for men is because it’s so versatile. You can wear it with formalwear (especially for work or weddings) but it’ll look just as good with a T-shirt and jeans when you’re heading to the bar. Flaws but not dealbreakers: It’s hard to pick any faults, but the case size may be slightly too large for wrists that are particularly small or skinny. Case Size: 43mm | Movement: Quartz Eco | Thickness: 10mm | Water Resistant: Yes | Material: Stainless Steel   2. Best Budget: Citizen Quartz Watch Why it’s great: Thanks to the brown croc-effect strap and gold-tone case, you could easily mistake this watch for a family heirloom. It looks like it would cost a bomb, but it’s actually the cheapest option on this list. Complete with a date indicator and powered by a Quartz movement, it’s a stylish and affordable choice for any well-dressed guy. When to wear it: You’ll want to show this off at social events, but it’ll make a lasting impression if you rock it in the office too. I find it looks particularly great worn with wardrobe staples such as an Oxford shirt, khakis, and loafers. Flaws but not dealbreakers: You can get it wet but you shouldn’t really wear it swimming or in the bath. Case Size: 42mm | Movement: Quartz | Thickness: 10.6mm | Water Resistant: Yes | Material: Stainless Steel   3. Best Luxury: Citizen Eco-Drive Promaster Blue Angels Skyhawk Titanium Watch Why it’s great: Made from light but super tough titanium, this Eco-Drive Promaster looks like something you’d find in a flight deck. Funny that, as it was made as a tribute to the United States Navy’s elite flight demonstration squadron—taking inspiration from The Blue Angels’ precision and grace in the air. The ultimate traveling companion, it offers atomic timekeeping in 43 cities, plus a perpetual calendar, dual time, alarms, and a rotating slide rule bezel. It’s powered by light and secured with a fold-over clasp complete with hidden push buttons. When to wear it: Realistically, you can wear it whenever you want, but I feel it’s one for those special occasions. Or at least when you’re making an effort to dress up. Flaws but not dealbreakers: You’ll need a slightly bigger budget to afford this one (plus a decent-sized wrist). That being said, it’s still considerably cheaper than many of the other luxury watches on the market. Case Size: 45mm | Movement: Quartz Eco | Thickness: 15mm | Water Resistant: Yes | Material: Stainless Steel   4. Best on Amazon: Citizen Classic Quartz Watch Why it’s great: Affordable, timeless, and versatile enough to dress up or down, this classic Citizen watch is presented in polished stainless steel with an eye-catching blue sunray dial and fold-over clasp. There’s a day/date window, while it’ll survive brief immersion in water. When to wear it: This option is the perfect addition to your smart-casual outfits, whether you’re wearing it to the office or after-work drinks. But if you want to dress it up, you can do that too. Don’t be afraid to wear it with a suit and shirt for weddings and important business events. Flaws but not dealbreakers: It’s water-resistant but not suitable for swimming. Be careful if you’re taking it on holiday and don’t forget to take it off before jumping into the pool. Case Size: 40mm | Movement: Quartz | Thickness: 9mm | Water Resistant: Yes | Material: Stainless Steel   5. Best Everyday: Citizen Addysen Eco-Drive Watch Why it’s great: Showcasing a silver-tone stainless steel case with a standout blue dial, the Addysen watch is the perfect everyday companion. You can wear it with pretty much anything and it’s powered by light (so never needs a new battery). Better yet, should you want to jump in the sea or paddle in the pool, it’s water-resistant up to 100 meters. When to wear it: Undoubtedly one of the best Citizen watches for men, the classic design can lend itself to formal and casual outfits alike, meaning you can wear it wherever you end up. Flaws but not dealbreakers: It barely glows in the dark, so I wouldn’t count on telling the time if you’re locked inside a cupboard. Case Size: 41mm | Movement: Quartz | Thickness: 10mm | Water Resistant: Yes | Material: Stainless Steel   6. Best Dive: Citizen Promaster Dive Eco-Drive Watch Why it’s great: Ready to take you to the deepest depths (200 meters to be exact) and highest heights, the Promaster Dive watch is perfect for explorers, offering up the perfect blend of functionality, durability, and safety. As tough as it is pretty, it’s powered by the light around you and features glow in the dark hands and markers—plus an aluminum ring on the bezel and a screw-back case. When to wear it: Make sure you’re wearing it for your outdoor adventures, but you can keep it on when you head out for lunch with friends. It’ll look just as good with your hiking gear or swim shorts as it will with shirts and jeans. Flaws but not dealbreakers: With a 44mm case and 12mm thickness, this is on the large side. It may feel too big for super small wrists. Case Size: 44mm | Movement: Quartz | Thickness: 12mm | Water Resistant: Yes | Material: Stainless Steel   7. Best Automatic: Citizen Promaster Sea Automatic Watch Why it’s great: This Promaster might be designed for the sea (it’ll go with you to depths of 200m), but it’ll feel just at home on land. Boasting a striking 44m case with anti-reflective sapphire crystal, it’s finished with a pufferfish-inspired serrated bezel and black polyurethane strap that makes it ideal for every day. Should you find yourself out in the dark, the luminous hands and markers ensure you’ll still be able to tell the time. When to wear it: Not just a fantastic diving partner, this watch will prove a great option for office days and weekends exploring the great outdoors. It looks best with smart-casual attire, but it won’t look out of place with a shirt and slacks. Flaws but not dealbreakers: The polyurethane strap tips it slightly towards the more casual end of the scale. It’s versatile enough to wear with casual and formalwear, but a dress watch would be better suited to tailoring. Case Size: 44mm | Movement: Automatic | Thickness: 13.2mm | Water Resistant: Yes | Material: Stainless Steel batwatches / Instagram Buying Considerations for The Best Citizen Watches Budget Before finding the best Citizen watches, you need to establish your budget.

Style Citizen sells a variety of watch styles, from classic chronographs to dive watches and dressy designs. Consider your personal style and the occasions you’ll be wearing the watch for. Think about whether you prefer a stainless steel bracelet or a leather strap and make sure the watch’s style aligns with your preferences and matches your wardrobe. Features In order to make sure you add the right timepiece to your watch wardrobe, take down notes on the sort of features you want or require. The best Citizen watches offer an assortment, including Eco-Drive technology, various complications (e.g., chronograph, date display, and alarm functions), water resistance, and luminous hands and markers. Think about what functions are most important to you, as they can greatly enhance the practicality of your watch. ziyadtari.9 / Instagram Why You Should Trust Us Not only have I owned my fair share of Citizen watches, I’ve spent over a decade writing about men’s clothing and accessories—giving me somewhat of an upper hand when it comes to knowing where to find the best gear. To ensure I only share the best Citizen watches for men on the market, I narrowed down a list of over 50 options to just seven. How did I do it? I looked at affordability, quality, versatility, and features, plus checked out hundreds of reviews to find out which ones have built up the best reputation.

FAQ Citizen watches are not generally considered high-end, but they are known for their quality, durability, and innovative technology. They primarily fall within the mid-range and affordable watch categories. While not essential, Citizen watches benefit from regular servicing to ensure they continue to perform accurately and reliably. The frequency of servicing can vary based on the specific model and its usage, but a general recommendation is to have your Citizen watch serviced approximately every 3-5 years.

However, with proper care and regular servicing, the best Citizen watches can last for several decades or even longer. Citizen is known for producing durable and reliable timepieces, and many owners have reported their watches continuing to function for 20 years or more.
