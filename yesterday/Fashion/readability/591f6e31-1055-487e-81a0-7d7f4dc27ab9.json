It’s really going to be slow and awkward and terrifying and joyful. Mainly I’m hoping I don’t lose anyone I care about.”Ms. Steele stores the Will Ferrell earrings in a box for safekeeping, only wearing them for special events. “I’m afraid to lose them,” she said. And with the exception of the fake pearls she wore during a video interview — just to balance out the rest of her outfit — Ms. Steele said she won’t wear jewelry “unless it means something.”In a conversation that’s been edited and condensed, Ms. Steele discusses the pieces that do mean something to her: her grandmother’s ring and her granny’s watch.ImageHarper Steele’s sister, Eleanor Steele, and her grandmother, Mary Lucile Steele, in Birmingham Ala., in 1970.Credit...via Harper SteeleTalk about the cameo ring from your paternal grandmother.My sister is sort of the vector for the feminine side of our family — I have two girls and a nonbinary kid, and I have three brothers. I associate more with the feminine side now, and I’m very happy to be a part of that side. And so my sister gave me this ring, which is my grandmother’s.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
