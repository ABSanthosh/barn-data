  "description": "I've always been a wide-leg denim person. Sunsetting skinny jeans from my wardrobe was honestly one of the smartest moves I've ever made. But JNCO (which stands for \"Judge None Choose One\") brings a whole new meaning to wide-leg jeans. Originally founded by Jacques Yaakov Revah and Haim Milo Revah in 1985, the label became a beloved '90s brand for skate, rave, and street cultures. The shape of these pants, with their oversize pockets and pooling material that grazed the floor, was inherently triangular. Many of them featured graffiti-like patches - with the signature logo following suit - colorful flaps, and contrast stitching to make a statement. Today, Milo and his daughter Camilla are successfully revitalizing JNCO, working alongside original designer Silvio Marceca to showcase the brand's roots while expanding into women's jeans. JNCO's also embracing sustainability and appealing to the eco-conscious customer by incorporating vintage pieces in the lineup. When I caught wind of JNCO's resurgence - celebrities including Billie Eilish, Justin Bieber, and Post Malone have been wearing them proudly, according to Camilla - I figured trying them would be my ultimate test: When it comes to jeans, just how wide am I willing to go? [I] felt like I was channeling a healthy mix of Avril Lavigne, Ginger Spice, and every boy band in the '90s. I settled on two of the brand's most popular styles: the Easy Wide Pipes ($160), which is a more classic iteration, and the Hypnotix ($280), which features red and white wave panels down the side, making it a descendent of the Solid State collection. While I had a pretty solid handle on styling the Pipes silhouette, since they didn't feel as baggy as I expected, the Hypnotix definitely turned heads. I wore them with a cropped Disney tee to achieve ultimate nostalgia and felt like I was channeling a healthy mix of Avril Lavigne, Ginger Spice, and every boy band in the '90s. A waiter at the restaurant I went to even complimented the pants excitedly, then proceeded to invite me out dancing. \"I'll look for the jeans,\" he promised me with a wink! Ahead, you can read more about the comeback of these viral JNCO jeans, see my outfits, and decide if tapping into the trend is right for you. What Made JNCO Jeans Popular in the '90s? \"JNCO jeans are a symbol of rebellion and individuality,\" Camilla says. \"More than just denim, JNCO represents freedom, creativity, and bold self-expression.\" The brand's popularity surged even further when school districts banned them back in the '90s, cementing their \"youthful defiant\" status. Their shape was significantly more exaggerated than what was conventional at the time, and their artistic, graffiti-inspired embroideries were a mode of self-expression. Why Are JNCO Jeans Coming Back? If you're into fashion, you likely know that the thirst for '90s nostalgia is real, especially among Gen-Z. From Eilish's quintessential grunge aesthetic to Bieber's all-oversize-everything approach to dressing, celebrities are at the heart of JNCO's comeback, influencing TikTokers to embrace the look - down to keychains tugging at the belt loops. \"Younger generations are rediscovering our iconic wide-leg styles, while longtime fans are thrilled to see the return of a brand that's always stood for individuality,\" Camilla says, continuing, \"What sets JNCO apart is our commitment to artistry and subculture. From skate to graffiti to music, JNCO has deep roots in creative communities. Our designs - like the Tribals with their incredible graphics or the Mammoths with their daring proportions - aren't just nostalgic; they're bold, unapologetic, and unique in a way that other brands can't quite replicate.\" Current JNCO bestsellers include the Mammoth, with 40-inch leg openings, the Twin Cannons, Pipes, and Low Downs, according to Camilla. \"Since the brand's inception, these styles have defined our legacy in the world of denim and streetwear,\" she says. Image Source: PS Photography / Sarah Wasilak What I Like About JNCO Jeans As a big fan of '90s fashion, JNCO jeans feel ridiculously cool to me simply because they're different. While you already know I prefer a wide-leg silhouette - and these pants lend me all that and then some - they're also conversation starters. The oversize patches and logos on these jeans aren't itchy or uncomfortable whatsoever, and I find that the giant pockets - especially the ones at the back - actually add to the roomy feel of the pant leg. While the denim is structured, there's enough stretch to easily pull them up or down and move freely. How to Style JNCO Jeans I was pleasantly surprised by how seamlessly my two pairs of JNCO jeans fit into my wardrobe. Of course, balancing proportions is key, so I opted for a fitted top to allow the jeans their full volume. Camilla also suggests implementing this modern twist, but maybe adding some silver chains to mimic the old-school style. If you're going to layer, she recommends tailored blazers or bomber jackets for structure. And choosing the right footwear is a must. \"Chunky sneakers, combat boots, or platform shoes work perfectly with the oversize legs,\" she says. I wore Western boots with the Pipes to give them more polish, since these weren't as exaggerated in form, and chunky sneakers with the Hypnotix to impart a sporty vibe and also keep my balance in check given the weight of the pant legs - more on that ahead. What to Consider Before Buying JNCO Jeans When you first remove your JNCO jeans from their packaging, know that they may feel a little stiff at first and require some breaking in. After wearing the jeans for about an hour, they loosen up and even sway a bit at the hem with every step you take. Of course, this is also dependent upon which style you choose, as some pants have a wider opening than others. Scan the product page carefully for this info (it's all there in the description) and choose the correct inseam by measuring your current favorite pair of jeans that fit you well from the crotch seam to the bottom interior of the leg. There's also a helpful size calculator on the site to use as a resource. Most importantly, know that these jeans are heavy - at least, in comparison to your standard denim. My Hypnotix pair weighs over two pounds, whereas my classic Levi's are just over a pound. You can definitely sense the difference in mass when you're holding up the jeans in front of you, but once they're on, you sort of just succumb to their weight. Just think of it as an exchange for how friggin' cool you look. Where Can You Buy JNCO Jeans? JNCO's current stock is available to shop at jnco.com. You can also thrift some authentic vintage pairs on eBay, including the Mammoth ($2,300), Skate Phat Kangaroo ($375), Jesters ($1,000), and more.

The oversize patches and logos on these jeans aren\u0026#39;t itchy or uncomfortable whatsoever, and I find that the giant pockets — especially the ones at the back — actually add to the roomy feel of the pant leg.

I wore Western boots with the Pipes to give them more polish, since these weren\u0026#39;t as exaggerated in form, and chunky sneakers with the Hypnotix to impart a sporty vibe and also keep my balance in check given the weight of the pant legs — more on that ahead.   \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"4\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat to Consider Before Buying JNCO Jeans\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"5\"\u003eWhen you first remove your JNCO jeans from their packaging, know that they may feel a little stiff at first and require some breaking in. After wearing the jeans for about an hour, they loosen up and even sway a bit at the hem with every step you take. Of course, this is also dependent upon which style you choose, as some pants have a wider opening than others. Scan the product page carefully for this info (it\u0026#39;s all there in the description) and choose the correct inseam by measuring your current favorite pair of jeans that fit you well from the crotch seam to the bottom interior of the leg. There\u0026#39;s also a helpful size calculator on the site to use as a resource.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"6\"\u003eMost importantly, know that these jeans are \u003cem\u003eheavy\u003c/em\u003e — at least, in comparison to your standard denim. My Hypnotix pair weighs over two pounds, whereas my classic Levi\u0026#39;s are just over a pound. You can definitely sense the difference in mass when you\u0026#39;re holding up the jeans in front of you, but once they\u0026#39;re on, you sort of just succumb to their weight. Just think of it as an exchange for how friggin\u0026#39; cool you look. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"7\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhere Can You Buy JNCO Jeans?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"8\"\u003eJNCO\u0026#39;s current stock is available to shop at \u003ca href=\"https://jnco.com/?ref=popsugar.com\u0026amp;=___psv__p_49418354__t_w__r_l.instagram.com%2F_\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ejnco.com\u003c/a\u003e.
