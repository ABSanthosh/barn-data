The collection includes versatile basics like shorts, track pants, flare pants, a cardigan, sweatshirt, V-neck sweater, button-down shirt, vest and fleece coat. Spanning sizes XXS through XXL, Nuuly subscribers can rent six items for $98/month and have the option to purchase after renting. The Nuuly x Donni collaboration is available now exclusively on nuuly.com. {Fashionista inbox}Uoma Beauty founder sues the brand's new ownersUoma Beauty founder Sharon Chuter has sued the brand's new owners, MacArthur Beauty LLC and BrainTrust, alleging that the purchase of its assets in December 2023 was an unauthorized and below market value sale. The complaint alleges fraudulent transfer of the business, unjust enrichment and receipt of stolen property. In the complaint, Chuter claims that Uoma Beauty, which was sold to satisfy a $6.2 million loan, had been valued as high as $50 million in 2022, and that the sale of the company's assets was below market value. She is seeking an unspecified amount of damages. {Business of Fashion/paywalled}Palisades Village Mall remains standing after fires, but what happens now?The Palisades wildfire, which took 24 days to be extinguished, burned more than 6,000 structures and killed at least 12 people. Many businesses were lost, but the ones at Rick Caruso's Palisades Village survived, leaving retailers wondering what to do next. Currently, the 35 fashion tenants which include Jennifer Meyer, Towne by Elyse Walker, Buck Mason, Cult Gaia, A.L.C., Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta and Isabel Marant are working with their insurance providers to assess damage. Jennifer Meyer is committed to reopening her Palisades Village store, and notes that she thinks \"the stores will have to be gutted\" due to the smoke damage. Caruso CEO Corinne Verdery told WWD that the mall plans on working with tenants \"to figure out coverage of rent and other obligations.\" \"Our goal is to support them and get them open,\" she continued. \"We've done it before in COVID times and we're ready to do it again.\" {WWD/paywalled}Saks Global stays firm on decision to close Neiman Marcus' Dallas flagshipSaks Global is doubling down on its decision to close the Neiman Marcus flagship in downtown Dallas. Last week, Saks officials said the decision was due to an inability to come to lease terms with a landlord over a small piece of the property, but on Thursday, Saks appeared to include the flagship's business prospects as a factor as well. Saks cited \"the slow resurgence of the downtown Dallas area over the last several years\" and a preference among customers to shop at the Neiman Marcus store in NorthPark Center, which is also in Dallas. A meeting between a Saks Global representative and the Dallas Consortium, a group of city leaders and businessmen aiming to enhance downtown Dallas, is expected next week. {WWD/paywalled}Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesRich people are 'firing a cash cannon' at the consumer market — but at what cost? Since 2020, Americans have spent lavishly on discretionary goods and services while the cost of necessities soared. Consumer debt has ballooned, Americans are defaulting on credit cards at rates unseen since the Great Recession and inflation has thwarted any wage growth, so who is buying the expensive, sold-out concert tickets and booking first-class airline seats? Rich people are firing a \"cash cannon\" at the consumer market, per Bloomberg: The wealthiest 10% of American households (those making more than $250,000 a year, roughly) are now responsible for half of all U.S. consumer spending and at least a third of the country's gross domestic product. In a well-functioning economy, spending would be more widely distributed, but instead a small group of people are keeping a large portion of the economy churning. {Bloomberg/paywalled}Is there room for emerging designers on the red carpet?As major luxury brands double down on red carpet placements, emerging designers who are navigating a challenging economic environment are either pulling back or prioritizing strategic relationships, lesser carpets and other events. Red carpet dressing can offer young brands legitimacy, awareness and credibility, but lately, LVMH- and Kering-owned brands have poured more money than ever into red carpet. This growing reach has made red carpet dressing seem like less of a viable marketing tool for emerging designers as it's increasingly difficult to even get on the carpet in the first place, so some up-and-coming designers are being more discerning about what opportunities will benefit them most. {Business of Fashion/paywalled}Why is young Hollywood going so old Hollywood?This awards season, young Hollywood stars like Mikey Madison, Selena Gomez, Elle Fanning, Zendaya and Ariana Grande are leaning into old Hollywood traditions of sweetheart necklines, sweeping trains and Audrey Hepburn homages. \"It feels like an extension of method dressing: dress for the job you want (an award-winning Hollywood diva of yore) and you might just go home with a statuette,\" Elle's Fashion Features Director Véronique Hyland writes. Nostalgia for old Hollywood is also driving this trend as the movie business no longer exudes the glamour it once did with streaming-only premieres and shrinking budgets. The overwhelming influx of vintage pulls has also led to many stars embracing vintage-inspired looks on the red carpet (if not donning the actual vintage garments themselves). {Elle}Homepage photo: Courtesy of NuulyPlease note: Occasionally, we use affiliate links on our site.
