Paris Fashion Week, which wrapped the fall/winter 2025 showcases on March 11, is bringing the stylish festivities to a close.

Think: modern-day LBDs, silhouettes that are just the right amount of oversized, extravagant coats, playful peep-toe shoes, ethereal organza, and so much more. Everywhere you looked, there was spring outfit inspiration to be found, whether in the form of styling hacks, new pieces to add to your closet, reinterpretations of well-worn staples, or just overall vibes. Scroll on to discover our favorite Paris Fashion Week street style looks from the fall/winter 2025 shows.
