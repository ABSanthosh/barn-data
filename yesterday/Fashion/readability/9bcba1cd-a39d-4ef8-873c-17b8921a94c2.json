Spring may be months away, but that doesn’t mean we can’t start curating our warm-weather wardrobe — especially now that Free People dropped its latest campaign, which is a feminine, boho daydream come to life. This new collection offers a fresh, modern take on the retailer’s signature look, featuring lace-trimmed and floral-print tees paired with utilitarian staples like barn jackets (still a thing!) and cargo-pocketed carpenter shorts. There’s also a prep-school charm woven in via cardigans and polos, styled with loafers and knee-high socks, as well as perfectly slouchy denim and ’90s-inspired baby tees. Then, of course, there are vacation-ready pieces with an artisanal feel for those spring break escapes to somewhere sun-soaked.With standout looks from in-house labels like We The Free and free-est, Free People’s spring collection nails every vibe worth pinning to your mood board. Take a closer look at the campaign and shop the six key trends for the season ahead.

Prep Classics Prep-school polish gets a Free People twist — think cardigans and polos with more exaggerated fits and distinctive details (hello, eyelet collar), styled back to loafers and knee-high socks. It’s a nod to timeless collegiate charm, only with a fresh edge. Big, Bold Denim  The whispers of a skinny jeans resurgence won’t have us parting with baggy jeans just yet. Slouchy, oversized silhouettes still have our hearts, whether paired with baby tees or bikini tops. Utility From cargo-pocketed vests to barn jackets that add structure to breezy spring ‘fits, these staples blend practicality with low-key cool — perfect for grounding those floral-print, lace-trimmed tops.

Just add sun, SPF, and a woven tote. ‘90s Minimalism  Channel your inner Gwyneth or Jen with ’90s-inspired staples like baby tees and lace-trimmed slip skirts.
