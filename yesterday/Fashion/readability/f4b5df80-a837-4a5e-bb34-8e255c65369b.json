  "description": "While I've collected lingerie through the years and have my bra-and-panty sets color-coded in a drawer, truth be told, I don't wear them often. I like to save them for special occasions (like vacations or weekends away) or moments I simply want to feel sexy. When it comes to bedtime, I'm much more of an oversize T-shirt and boy shorts kind of girl. That being said, I'm definitely picky about the comfort level of lingerie. It's not easy to feel hot when there's underwire digging into my rib cage or a gusset so thin I have to keep adjusting it to ensure full coverage down there. When I scrolled past this fiery video of Rihanna rocking her new Savage X Fenty Loveline collection, my first impression was that it seemed secure and she looked notably confident. The look - down to the heart-shaped nipple pasties - was holiday-festive without being gimmicky. It had been a minute since I tried anything from Savage X Fenty, so I decided to put the Loveline pieces to the test just in time for Valentine's Day. Ahead, you can read my full review of the Savage X Fenty Loveline Brazilian 2-Piece Set ($85), which I tried in both the Timeless Red and Black Caviar shades and styled with the Savage X Fenty Stockings With Backseam ($33), Savage X Fenty Satin Garter Belt ($33), and heart-shaped pasties, which are sadly sold out. About the Savage X Fenty Loveline Brazilian 2-Piece Set The bra comes in band sizes 32-46 and cup sizes A-DDD; the panty in XS-4X. The fabric is embroidered lace with a loose, scalloped-edge trim. While the lace is stiff, there are stretch inserts at the front and back and the waistband is elastic. The bra is unlined with underwire and interior plastic boning; the straps are adjustable. The gusset liner in the panty is cotton. The pieces should be hand-washed in cold water and left out to air dry. The set has five stars with 16 reviews at time of posting, many of which praise the flattering cut of the panties. What I Like About the Savage X Fenty Loveline Set The Savage X Fenty Loveline Set is beautifully made, and the weight of the fabric is a testament to that. While the details are certainly revealing - the bra is completely see-through if you don't wear pasties and the sheer elements around the upper-thigh area of the panties is not for the faint of heart - they evoke the bold sensuality that Savage X Fenty has become known for. The added accoutrements somehow provided a finishing touch that made me feel \"fully dressed\" (ironic, I know), and significantly more confident in the look. What's more, I am absolutely obsessed with the stockings. Stitched with cute \"Savage X\" embroidery on both sides, they actually stay up on their own, even without affixing the garter straps. While the black hue I tried is now sold out, there are seven other unique colorways to shop in sizes XS/S-4X. The thigh band is wide, which I think is key for support, and the smooth, sheer material is thin without feeling flimsy. I just might work these into an academia-inspired outfit with loafers and a skater skirt later on. Is the Savage X Fenty Loveline Set Comfortable? I was delightfully surprised by how comfortable this set is. With the addition of accessories like the heart-shaped pasties underneath and even the garter belt - something I'm not used to wearing - I couldn't believe I felt zero sharp edges digging into my skin. The sparkly ruffle trim and bows weren't itchy, either. The only caveat is that if you're more comfortable in a tighter-fit panty, the loose, airy lay of this trim might take some getting used to. I personally found it to be a welcome change from my other underwear - and even flattering when I pulled the elastic waistband up to a higher rise. What to Consider Before Buying the Savage X Fenty Loveline Set If you don't love mesh, sheer fabrics, underwire, or a loose-fit panty, I'd reconsider before purchasing this set. If you love the look but know you prefer a secure, supportive bottom, I would size down to achieve a tighter snatch against the skin. Where You Can Buy the Savage X Fenty Loveline Set? The Savage X Fenty Loveline Brazilian 2-Piece set is available on the brand's website as part of The V-Day Shop. Rating: Sarah Wasilak (she/her) is the associate director of Shopping at PS.

While the details are certainly revealing — the bra is completely see-through if you don\u0026#39;t wear pasties and the sheer elements around the upper-thigh area of the panties is not for the faint of heart — they evoke the bold sensuality that Savage X Fenty has become known for. The added accoutrements somehow provided a finishing touch that made me feel \u0026#34;fully dressed\u0026#34; (ironic, I know), and significantly more confident in the look.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"2\"\u003eWhat\u0026#39;s more, I am absolutely obsessed with the stockings. Stitched with cute \u0026#34;Savage X\u0026#34; embroidery on both sides, they \u003cem\u003eactually\u003c/em\u003e stay up on their own, even without affixing the garter straps. While the black hue I tried is now sold out, there are seven other unique colorways to shop in sizes XS/S-4X. The thigh band is wide, which I think is key for support, and the smooth, sheer material is thin without feeling flimsy. I just might work these into an academia-inspired outfit with loafers and a skater skirt later on. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"3\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eIs the Savage X Fenty Loveline Set Comfortable?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"4\"\u003eI was delightfully surprised by how comfortable this set is. With the addition of accessories like the heart-shaped pasties underneath and even the garter belt — something I\u0026#39;m not used to wearing — I couldn\u0026#39;t believe I felt zero sharp edges digging into my skin. The sparkly ruffle trim and bows weren\u0026#39;t itchy, either. The only caveat is that if you\u0026#39;re more comfortable in a tighter-fit panty, the loose, airy lay of this trim might take some getting used to. I personally found it to be a welcome change from my other underwear — and even flattering when I pulled the elastic waistband up to a higher rise. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"5\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat to Consider Before Buying the Savage X Fenty Loveline Set\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"6\"\u003eIf you don\u0026#39;t love mesh, sheer fabrics, underwire, or a loose-fit panty, I\u0026#39;d reconsider before purchasing this set. If you love the look but know you prefer a secure, supportive bottom, I would size down to achieve a tighter snatch against the skin. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"7\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhere You Can Buy the Savage X Fenty Loveline Set?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"8\"\u003eThe Savage X Fenty Loveline Brazilian 2-Piece set is available on the brand\u0026#39;s website as part of \u003ca href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701743\u0026amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.savagex.com%2Ffeatures%2Fgift-guide\u0026amp;xcust=___psv__p_49427651__t_w_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer sponsored\"\u003eThe V-Day Shop\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"9\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRating:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e ★★★★☆ \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"11\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/author/sarah-wasilak\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSarah Wasilak\u003c/a\u003e (she/her) is the associate director of Shopping at PS.
