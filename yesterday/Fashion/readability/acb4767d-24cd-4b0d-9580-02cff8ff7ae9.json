The interview spread quickly around social media as soon as it was published on Thursday.In the interview, Ms. Wilson, who is a trans woman, discussed a wide variety of topics, including whether she is famous (“I don’t like saying that I’m famous because I want to do something more to deserve that fame”), her relationship with social media (“I am the Queen of Threads”), her family (“I do not actually know how many siblings I have”) and her politics (“I am constantly shifting and evolving”).But it was her in-depth discussion of her father that had the internet buzzing as soon as the piece was published. She addressed the debate over his hand gestures at an inaugural event for President Trump in January, saying, “Honey, we’re going to call a fig a fig, and we’re going to call a Nazi salute what it was.” She emphasized that she is financially independent and said she had had no relationship with Mr. Musk since 2020. She said he was “not as supportive as my mom” when she transitioned and began taking testosterone blockers. And she said she is not afraid to speak out against him despite his wealth and influence.“People thrive off of fear,” she said. “I’m not giving anyone that space in my mind.”Mr. Musk, who did not respond to a request for comment, has not publicly addressed the interview.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
