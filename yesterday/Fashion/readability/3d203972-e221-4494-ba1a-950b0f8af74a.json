The only friends we have here are his two best friends from childhood, with whom he has remained close in the decade since he moved away, and their significant others. This weekend, we saw on Instagram that both couples posted photos from a fun weekend trip they took as a foursome. My husband was very hurt that he was not invited, and I was offended, too. We will be celebrating one of their birthdays next weekend, and I want to tell them that we would have loved to come along on their weekend trip. My husband thinks that would be obtuse. Your thoughts?WIFEI wish there were a different word for self-centeredness — one that had fewer negative connotations and that underscored the hurt that often causes it. Because that’s what I think is animating you and your husband here. I get your predicament: You and your husband feel fragile and lonely after moving to a new town where you know very few people. I suspect that many people who have made similar moves will understand your feelings.At the same time, you must see that your husband’s two friends are not required to handcuff themselves to you 24/7. They will make plans with each other, and with other people, in which you will not be included. In the decade your husband was away, it’s only natural that they and their significant others have forged relationships that have nothing to do with him (or you). So, while your hurt feelings make sense, you were not wronged here.The solution to this problem, I think, is broadening your own lives — not trying to cajole your friends into narrowing theirs. Unfortunately, this project takes time. But if you explore your natural interests — sports, the arts, adult education classes — you will eventually meet new people with whom you are simpatico and will become less dependent on your husband’s childhood friends. I wouldn’t say anything to them about their weekend getaway.ImageCredit...Miguel PorlanForgive Me! (Now and on My Terms, Ideally.)Every Christmas, I make my children, 10 and 12, memory albums using photos I have taken during the year. This year, I accidentally left out my mother from the albums. All the other grandparents are there. It was an honest mistake. My mother, who is prone to jealousy, called me distraught about her exclusion. I apologized immediately, but when she kept crying, I got furious! I couldn’t make this right, and she was only making me feel worse. I called her “mean” and “miserable,” and she hung up on me. She is now giving me the silent treatment. Should I cave to her immature behavior and call her?Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
