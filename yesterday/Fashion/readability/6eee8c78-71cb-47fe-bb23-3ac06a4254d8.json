  "text": "This year served pop music fans well: We got to experience Chappell Roan's meteoric rise to stardom alongside her \"Hot To Go\" anthem, Beyoncé's genre-defying \"Cowboy Carter,\" \"Brat\" summer and, of course, the many international tours that overtook our social media feeds (and boosted global economies).As Taylor Swift's the Eras Tour, Charli XCX and Troye Sivan's \"Sweat\" Tour and Sabrina Carpenter's \"Short n' Sweet\" Tour all made their way across the globe — the anticipation surrounding what the artists wore each night surged. With these concerts (read: major pop culture moments) offering a key marketing opportunity for fashion brands to reach new audiences, Launchmetrics released data analyzing the impact these tours had on the fashion brands featured on stage.As the highest grossing tour of all time, Swift's Eras Tour is set to come to a close this December after showcasing a host of custom outfits. Fashion plays a particularly important role in Swift's show as she sonically and sartorially traverses her albums: Styled by Joseph Cassell, the music superstar opens with her \"Lover\" era, donning different custom bedazzled Versace bodysuits, and then heads into \"Fearless,\" where she changes into a custom Roberto Cavalli mini dress.During Swift's tour, she generated $6.3 million in media impact value (MIV) for Versace and $4.9 million MIV for Roberto Cavalli Couture, according to data from Launchmetrics monitored between May 17, 2023 and July 27, 2023. Swift also tapped Roberto Cavalli to design some of her \"Reputation\"-era bodysuits complete with sparkling serpentine designs as well as her \"1989\" two-piece fringe sets, which often change color for different shows.Swift also spotlights Zuhair Murad Couture during her \"Midnights\" section, garnering $2.3 million MIV for the brand through midnight-blue bodysuits featuring intricate beading, silver star motifs and cut-out detailing.On the heels of \"Brat\" summer, Charli XCX and Troye Sivan — styled by Chris Horan and Marc Forné, respectively — began their shared \"Sweat\" Tour this September and quickly captivated audiences with a club-like atmosphere. The duo kicked off the tour in coordinating head-to-toe Acne Studios 'fits, which helped the brand rake in $643K in MIV. It's no surprise, then, that Charli XCX is now the face of the brand.But Alexander McQueen took the top spot for the \"Sweat\" tour's fashion with $681K in MIV thanks to Charli XCX's flowing white dress designed by Seàn McGirr. The tour also featured designs from well-known luxury brands such as Saint Laurent ($120K MIV), Gucci ($85K MIV) and Luar ($53K MIV).Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesMatching her music's flirty nature, Sabrina Carpenter's \"Short n' Sweet\" Tour is filled with sparkly mini dresses and lingerie-inspired pieces, which makes Victoria's Secret a natural brand placement. Styled by Jared Ellner in custom bedazzled bustiers, sheer slips and matching lace stockings in a variety of different colors, Carpenter generated $747,000 in MIV for Victoria's Secret. The star also spotlighted emerging designer Ludovic de Saint Sernin by donning the brand's sparkly halter-neck two-piece sets on stage, earning $578,000 in MIV for the label. Carpenter has also been wearing custom lace capri-length bodysuits by Patou (which alternate bow colors for different shows), resulting in $213,000 in MIV for the French label.Given the international reach of today's pop musicians, these global tours offer fashion brands access to massive audiences who are tuned into artists' every move and outfit change. Essentially, tours have become an extension of a fashion brand's runway, offering another outlet to market their designs.Ahead, see which brands garnered the most MIV via strategic placements on international tours, according to Launchmetrics data.Sabrina Carpenter's \"Short n' Sweet\" Tour1.
