If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. What better way to celebrate the chilly season than with the beloved winter Reformation sale? The reader-favorite dress destination’s biggest markdown event has arrived with a bang: For a limited time, score up to 50% off select styles, from luxe holiday dresses and skirts to polished pants and cozy cardigans (both of which are s’cute for the office or a dinner date). These discounts demand the online equivalent of an awkward, arms-flailing speed walk — scrolling with purpose and maybe a little panic. So, get moving and scoop up favorites fast. The cutest ‘fits won’t wait, and neither should you. DashDividers_1_500x100 Up To 50% Off Reformation Sweaters From oversized cashmere polos to a scarf-adorned crewneck, Reformation’s knits deliver in quality and trend appeal. Secure your cozy winter favorites before they’re gone for good. DashDividers_1_500x100 Up To 50% Off Reformation Dresses It wouldn’t be a Reformation sale without marked-down dresses. Think of it as a treasure trove of minis, midis, and maxis, from shimmering, party-ready gowns to fitted sweater styles perfect for casual plans. DashDividers_1_500x100 Up To 40% Off Reformation Coats \u0026 Jackets Timeless wool coats, ladylike jackets, quiet luxury toppers: Reformation’s on-sale outerwear selection is filled with modern classics. DashDividers_1_500x100 Up To 50% Off Reformation Tops \u0026 Tees Reformation does silky boho blouses and second-skin tops with asymmetrical details like no other. Its on-sale edit is all about transitional statement pieces — great to layer under a jacket by day and wear solo with sculptural earrings for date night. DashDividers_1_500x100 Up To 50% Off Reformation Pants \u0026 Skirts Bold red silk pants are a seasonal “It” item, but you can also find slouchy tailored trousers, bubble skirts, and a fringe-sequin mini (screaming New Year’s Eve) at the Reformation sale. Dial them up for a party or temper with a chunky knit and flats for the office. DashDividers_1_500x100 Up To 40% Off Reformation Denim There’s no such thing as too much denim — especially from Reformation. The sale is stacked with fresh takes on the classics, from black and dark indigo washes to bomber-style jackets and the sleekest mini dress for a prim edge. DashDividers_1_500x100 Up To 40% Off Reformation Shoes Take your pick from Reformation’s on-sale shoe lineup, where trends and timelessness meet. Ballet flats, slingbacks, kitten heels, and knee-high boots (in a delectable espresso brown) are all here — the finishing touch for any winter look. DashDividers_1_500x100 Up To 50% Off Reformation Bags Reformation’s on-sale bags are seriously good. You have supple leather buckets with the perfect slouch, the cutest suede satchel in trending grey, a rhinestone-adorned mesh mini made for party nights, and a ‘90s-inspired snake-print shoulder bag that goes with everything.  DashDividers_1_500x100 For more can’t-miss shopping stories delivered straight to your inbox, sign up for our Most Wanted newsletter.
