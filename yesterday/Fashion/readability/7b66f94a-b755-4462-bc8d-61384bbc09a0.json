And the women involved know it.It’s their opportunity to introduce themselves not only to fans, the watching world and their new teammates, but also to the potential sponsors who can bolster their relatively small salaries. (Ms. Bueckers, who is often referred to as the new face of the W.N.B.A., is reportedly making only $78,831 her first year.) The simplest way to do that is through their look.“These girls sit at the intersection of sport, culture and fashion,” Cathy Engelbert, the W.N.B.A. commissioner, said just before the draft, herself wearing a nipped-in raspberry Sergio Hudson pantsuit. The goal, she went on, is “growing their brands, not just in their team market, but nationally and globally.”Perhaps that’s why the bar set at last year’s draft by Caitlin Clark in Prada and Cameron Brink in Balmain was raised this time around. The biggest trend of draft night was individuality; after all, as Stuart Vevers, Coach’s creative director, pointed out, both fashion and sports are “grounded in self-expression.” But don’t take it from us. Here’s what the players had to say.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
