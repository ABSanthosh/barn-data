    "description": "From Rihanna to Loewe, jeans are enjoying a wide-legged moment. But for all of the excess denim being worn on catwalks, by celebrities and by gen Z, will the skinny ever truly fall out of favour?More than any other clothing item, jeans can define the look of an era. Think of the flare in the 70s, or the skater styles of the 90s. Or – right now – the oversized jean. The skinny jean was the cockroach of the denim world for a long time: it refused to die. But there are signs it finally has. Maybe that’s the effect of generational wars on social media, with gen Z roasting millennials’ love of the skinnies, or a post-pandemic need for comfort.Either way, shapes are changing, and bigger is becoming the overriding choice. The online vintage retailer Depop reports that searches for baggy jeans have increased 66% since January, and style icons – Rihanna, Hailey Bieber, Billie Eilish, Dakota Johnson and more – are going for a the-baggier-the-better approach to denim. Gap’s Get Loose campaign with Troye Sivan perhaps cemented the look: it features the singer surrounded by dancers all wearing oversized jeans. Continue reading...",

I’ve often wondered if that’s because my favourites just don’t suit me. Perfumer Caterina Catalani, now at the helm of Floris London, reminds me it’s not about external olfactory validation: “Scent is deeply personal, and the best fragrance is one that resonates with you.”That’s easy to say, but the perfume aisles (in store, online and on social media) can be overwhelming. “While some may gravitate toward a single fragrance, I believe in the power of variety – your fragrances should reflect different aspects of your personality and mood, and evoke memories,” Catalani says.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. While some people wish never to recall early 2000s trends, to this day my inner pre-teen clings to the skirt-over-jeans look. Protest all you want, but there’s something so right about Ashley Tisdale in a sequin mini skirt and matching ballet flats, bridged by baggy boot-cut jeans.  The Y2K trend has gradually returned to mainstream fashion over the last few years, but it remains as polarizing as the skinny jeans debate (which is also turning on its head, by the way). Our cultural consensus swings from skirts-over-jeans being cool to it being a total layering faux pas. But as seen with this year’s capri pants renaissance, it’s often the most divisive trends that make the best outfits. The fall/winter 2024 runways proved its sartorial power, with Paloma Wool and Conner Ives pairing bubble skirts with pants, and Marques’ Almeida styling a mini dress on top of wide-leg jeans. For spring/summer 2025, Chopova Lowena and Diesel’s runways were masterclasses in double-denim looks, while Bottega Veneta previewed midi skirts over pants, too. Besides being designer-approved, wearing a skirt over jeans also has practical benefits. The additional layer extends the wear of your summer skirts, keeping you warmer than tights. By blending feminine and flowy styles with casual bottoms, you can transform both items for any occasion, from the office to a night out.  For tips and inspiration for this nostalgic layering hack, scroll on to discover the four ways I’m styling skirts over jeans this fall. How To Wear A Midi Skirt Over Jeans Start with a midi skirt over jeans if you’re dipping your toe into the trend: The longer length allows for more styling freedom. I was inspired by Chopova Lowena’s pleated skirt styling and paired a knee-length kilt with oversized jeans for this off-duty ‘fit. While the outfit would have been pretty classic without the jeans, the added layer gives it the perfect laid-back vibes for casual weekend plans. How To Style A Skirt Over Printed Jeans  Print-clashing can be daunting but thanks to the eclectic styling of this trend, bold pattern choices work well. Here, I paired a Marine Serre tartan mini skirt that I got from Depop with my faithful leopard-print jeans to achieve a rebellious schoolgirl look. Keep it simple with neutrals everywhere else to avoid the existential crisis vibes. How To Style A Mini Dress Over Jeans I know, I know: A mini dress isn’t technically a skirt — but tell me this doesn’t have the same indie-inspired impact. I love this party dress from the Turkish brand Maksu, but rarely have an opportunity to wear it. By adding jeans and a motorcycle jacket, I can dress it down for various occasions and wear it more often throughout the year. How To Wear A Skirt Over Metallic Jeans This combination of a black mini with metallic pants proves a skirt over jeans can be dressed up, too. By styling with dark neutrals throughout the rest of the outfit, you can ensure your jeans (and you) will be the star of the show. Pair with pointed-toe shoes to elevate the look. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shelby-ivey-christie-haute-heritage-publishing-interview?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Shelby Ivey Christie knows how to tell a fashion tale like no one else.  She’s one of the industry’s most beloved historians, particularly for highlighting the rich depth of lesser-known, often uncredited Black stories. On Twitter (or X, if anyone actually calls it that), she breaks down sartorial narratives related to both people and styles across time, from the prevalence of gold teeth in the South to Tracee Ellis Ross’ costumes in Girlfriends. Her next venture, though, brings her mission to a much larger scale.  This week, Christie announced the launch of Haute Heritage Publishing, a new imprint aiming to shift the narrative around fashion history by focusing on its untold stories. Its debut title, Black Fashion Legends, is an ABC-style book spotlighting key industry figures like model Beverly Johnson (for “B”) and designer Ann Cole Lowe (for “L”). June Ambrose penned an encouraging foreword, which Christie describes as “a true call to action to readers, particularly young readers.” Haute Heritage was partly inspired by moments with family and friends’ kids. “I’m the fashion auntie, and I wanted to give something related to fashion, so I got them their first fashion book,” she says. “My cousins and friends loved it for their kids, but I thought this doesn’t really have anyone that resonates with me. It’s great that Coco Chanel, Karl Lagerfeld, and Grace Coddington are in there, but how are they going to learn about Dapper Dan and Misa Hylton? How are they going to learn all the things that are directly reflective of their culture and identity?” A pivot had been a long time coming for Christie. She started as a closet intern in the early 2010s at W, before going on to work as a marketer at leading luxury brands like Vogue, Amazon, and L’Oréal. She began building up her social feed and gaining recognition for her insightful commentary — halfway through 2020, though, she started thinking about the next phase for her work and, specifically, moving it offline. “I felt like I had done all the threads I could do,” she says. “The rest of my industry finally started saying, ‘Hmm, we do have a diversity problem.’ I felt like, ‘Okay, my work is done. I moved the needle. What’s next?’” By February 2023, she started ideating what became Haute Heritage. (That wasn’t her only professional shift: She’s currently pursuing an MBA at Central Saint Martins, fashion’s scholastic holy grail, or “the Harvard of fashion,” as she calls it.) Haute Heritage has a similar goal to Christie’s online footprint — “to bring engaging, fun, accurate, fashion content to people in a way that engages everyone,” she says. Its mission stands on three pillars: diverse storytelling, accessibility, and improving talent pipeline in the area of diversity. She wants to platform lesser-told stories, reach more people than through her online channels, and engage readers who might not otherwise feel like fashion had a place for them. That’s why she wanted the house’s first book to appeal to a wide age range.  “The sooner we can put these figures in front of children, the sooner children who are interested in fashion can see people who look like them and have created or are creating impact in the industry, the sooner they can be inspired to bring their talent and innovation into our industry,” she says.  For Christie, it was crucial to include figures who are still alive and active in fashion, in addition to those who have passed away. “A lot of what I cover as a historian is past tense, and that means, for the people who have passed on, we don’t have the benefit of following their journey in real time, of interviewing them and gleaning from their wisdom. It was really important to have figures who are living, so kids can engage with their journey,” she says. Publishing has a known diversity issue. (The industry remains three-quarters white.) “When there isn’t diversity in stakeholders within a business, that means that there is a limited perspective on what gets published, what gets attention,” Christie says. “And that goes across any industry.” Christie hopes to bring in more collaborators, especially designers and celebrities for a range of books, flashcards, and, potentially, games. “That engaging, fun piece is important to me,” she says. While there’ll be space to focus on painful histories, there’ll be plenty of room for joy as well. “We need celebration, lightheartedness, and fun, too.” Black Fashion Legends is available for purchase now.
