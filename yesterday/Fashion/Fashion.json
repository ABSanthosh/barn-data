    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/kylie-jenner-khy-smooth-stretch-capri-catsuit-review-49405177",
    "description": "When I first saw Kylie Jenner modeling her Khy Smooth Stretch Capri Catsuit ($78) on Instagram, I was struck by the simplicity of the look. We've seen the 27-year-old entrepreneur and beauty mogul in everything from intricate corsets to unfathomable cutouts, so this pared back moment really stopped me in my tracks. Jenner was in Italy, rocking the backless number to dinner with nothing but Maison Margiela leather flats, gold jewelry, and an oversize woven tote. The outfit honestly stuck with me for a while. And when, months later, I saw that the design - available in black, light gray, and cherry - was a bestseller on Khy.com, I was convinced I needed to try it. I've never been much of a one-piece lover. If anything, I'd consider a nylon-spandex silhouette like this appropriate material for a workout set, not a going-out moment. And seeing how flattering it was on Jenner didn't exactly bestow me with any confidence. Chalk it up to the simultaneous rise of the demure trend and its impact on fashion, but I just really liked how Jenner's styling of the catsuit felt considered yet uncomplicated. Ahead, you can see how I styled her exact design and how I felt wearing it out in public. About the Khy Clothing Brand by Kylie Jenner Khy was launched in October 2023 as a collaborative brand inspired by Jenner's wardrobe that teams up with high-fashion designers on drops. Sizes range from XXS-4X/00-34 and prices range from $28 to $252. To date, Khy's global design collaborators include Namilia, Atlein, Ioannes, Natasha Zinko, and Entire Studios. The bestselling Khy Smooth Stretch Capri Catsuit was part of Drop 009 Golden Hour. What I Like About Kylie Jenner's Khy Smooth Stretch Capri Catsuit Like many Skims products I've tried, the Khy Smooth Stretch Capri Catsuit fits like a second skin. It's extremely comfortable, especially since you can adjust it to your liking with the halter neck tie at the back. The piece is constructed from 85 percent nylon and 15 percent spandex, making it flexible and smooth, but still opaque and not at all sheer like a pair of tights. (In other words, I couldn't make out every little butt dimple or body curve through the fabric.) I felt sexy when I put it on, but still relatively covered up. I didn't look naked; rather, surprisingly elegant and graceful - like a ballerina. How to Style the Khy Catsuit Like Kylie Jenner As previously mentioned, I took a liking to Jenner's styling with a simple pair of black flats - mine being a patent iteration with a bow at the toe from Cider - but I felt most comfortable when I added my oversize Frame denim jacket and pushed up the sleeves for an effortless streetwear touch. I accessorized with my rectangular Otra Eyewear frames and a pop of yellow, courtesy of my Fendi croissant shoulder bag sourced from Vivrelle. As a bonus, I even wore the catsuit on Halloween with a pair of black leather knee-high boots, which is a popular way to style the Khy Smooth Stretch Capri Catsuit, according to social media. What to Consider Before Buying Kylie Jenner's Khy Smooth Stretch Capri Catsuit At the end of the day, the catsuit is a very tight article of clothing that bares skin and is designed to show off the body, so it's natural to feel weary about slipping into it - especially without any extra layers. As I wore it, I also felt like the crotch area \"dropped\" a bit over time, rather than staying perfectly taut and in place. This tends to bother me when it comes to wearing one-pieces, although others may not even notice a little natural slippage. Note the black version of the Khy catsuit isn't currently stocked in all sizes. And if you're looking for something like this in a full-length leg, I would browse through the alternative options below, because the inseam is cropped at only 23 inches. Where to Buy Kylie Jenner's Catsuit From Khy You can purchase the Khy Smooth Stretch Capri Catsuit directly on the brand's site, or shop similar options from Skims ($148), Popilush ($59, originally $69), Lane Bryant ($90), Amazon ($30), Spiritual Gangster ($128), or Shapellx ($39, originally $58).
