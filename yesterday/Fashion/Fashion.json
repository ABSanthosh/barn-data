Start with a makeup primer that gives a glow, but not too much. Avoid oily foundations.

    "description": "As much as we love playing dress up, slipping in and out of the latest, greatest fashion trends, it is always impossible to resist the appeal of a matching sweatsuit or lounge set. They’re cozy, they’re comfy, they’re cute, and — if made with quality and care — will last you a lifetime. Not to mention, all the purposes they can serve. Existing somewhere between sporty athleisure and a polished co-ord, sweatsuits are an easy shortcut if you are hoping to look casual yet put-together. Throw one on when you can't be bothered to style an outfit, are cramming a week’s worth of chores into one day, working remotely (and need a slightly more polished upgrade to pajamas), or are traveling; sweatpants are a savior for curling up on chilly planes. Even better, the pieces can also be worn individually — which promises endless mix-and-match possibilities when you do have time to deliberate on what to wear.So, if you’re ready to finally replace those ratty, holey sweats gathering dust in your wardrobe, we’ve got you covered. (No judgment, we all have that one pair that’s seen us through school, college, and countless duvet days). Ahead, find 20 top-quality and stylish sweatsuit sets from retailers we love and trust. We’ve covered all seasons here — from lightweight short sweats and ultra-lightweight cotton lounge sets for summer, to thick, cozy sweat sets for fall and winter hibernation.All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

Abercrombie has long been famous for its expansive collection of flattering jeans, which are editor-loved. But recently, the retailer went through a little makeover of its own; long gone are the days of logo-filled graphic T-shirts and limited denim offerings, now the brand is a haven for all types of fashion-lovers - and sizes. It's the best place to shop for everything from stylish, elevated basics to vintage-inspired looks, seasonal trends, and even wedding-guest dresses. The brand is clearly back and better than ever, and if TikTok hasn't already convinced you to shop at Abercrombie, let us do that for you.

Right now, the brand is hosting a Sweaters and Sweatshirts event where you can get 20 percent off all sweatshirts and sweaters, just in time for the cozy season. Plus, if something doesn't fit quite right, or the color you've been eyeing is finally back in stock, the brand makes it convenient to file a return or exchange. Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch's Return Policy Abercrombie and Fitch has a return policy of 30 days from the date of the last shipment, as long as you have your receipt, invoice, or order confirmation. Returns received after the 30-day mark will be refunded in an e-gift card for merchandise credit. If you love a style but just need a different size or color, you can exchange it in store or online through this returns portal. Active Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch Promo Codes and Sales During Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch's Sweaters and Sweatshirts event, not only do you get 20 percent off all sweatshirts and sweaters, but also 15 percent off almost everything else.
