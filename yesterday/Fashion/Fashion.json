    "description": "Packing panic? Our fashion guru’s July picks are worth every inch of suitcase space• The best summer shoes: 44 sandals, pumps and trainers for everyoneIt is so bloody hard to pack the perfect holiday suitcase, and so deeply satisfying when you get it right. One of the few moments when I really feel like a competent grownup who has everything under control, rather than someone who is winging it and dropping plates left, right and centre, is when I manage to pack a great case.To not forget anything crucial, but also not overstuff to zip-busting point, gives me a sense of control in a world full of chaos, and gets my holiday off to a serene start. So, in anticipation of peak holiday season, my July edit is devoted to pieces that are worthy of your precious suitcase space. Includes: travel trousers (my current obsession), conversation-piece earrings (my perennial obsession) – and scroll to the bottom for the £80 swimsuit that will make you feel like a million dollars.

    "description": "To paraphrase Lana Del Rey, there’s something special about hot summer nights in July. Whether it’s sipping a spritz on a sunny balcony with friends or reading in the park after a day at work, the warm nights are here — and we’re cherishing every single one.The most glamorous place to be enjoying the sun, though, has been Men’s Paris Fashion Week, with hordes of celebrities flocking to the European capital for a slice of summer style inspo. From Jacquemus showing its Spring/Summer 2026 collection in L’Orangerie at the Château de Versailles to Dior borrowing paintings from the Louvre for an art museum-inspired extravaganza for Jonathan Anderson's creative director debut, the shows have been attended by some of the industry’s most famous faces.For the latter, the guest list included fashion It couple ASAP Rocky and Rihanna, with the pregnant A-lister styling a mint waistcoat and classic white shirt with pearls, yellow-lensed sunglasses, and a wavy updo. Sabrina Carpenter was also in attendance, opting for a preppy skirt suit set and a side-swept fringe complete with a statement barrette.  But it was perhaps Pharrell’s Louis Vuitton show that caused the biggest stir on the internet, when Beyoncé arrived in a full Cowboy Carter-inspired double denim outfit, accessorized with a big blond blowdry, cowboy hat, Western buckled belt, and feathery brown jacket.While our invites might have been lost in the post, there’s still plenty of serious fashion and beauty moments to get involved with over the coming month. To take a look at all the best launches coming up this July, click through the slideshow ahead. Cecilie Bahnsen x Asics SportStyle Gel-Cumulus ShoeAs part of a new Signature Series, Asics has chosen frequent collaborator Cecilie Bahnsen as the first designer to reinterpret an iconic silhouette from the sportswear brand. Known for her hyper-feminine puff-sleeved dresses and full skirts, the collaboration sees the Danish designer add her ethereal touch to the Gel-Cumulus 16 SSCB sneaker. Available in three colorways (black, gray, and butter yellow), the design combines transparent materials, floral prints, and a flower lace toggle.Available to shop at Cecilie BahnsenCecilie Bahnsen x ASICS GEL-CUMULUS 16 SSCB SNEAKERS, $, available at Cecilie BahnsenPrada Balm in Banana YellowInspired by the banana print in Prada's Spring/Summer 2011 collection, the fashion house is now bringing the sunshine yellow motif into its beauty lineup. Teased in Sabrina Carpenter's \"Manchild\" music video, the bright yellow bullet offers a sheer but sunny look, with the golden flecks effortlessly creating a juicy finish on lips or dewy cheeks depending on where you apply it. Enriched with moisturizing jojoba oil and infused with a sweet banana scent, this balm is about to be the coveted handbag staple of the summer. Available on July 8th at PradaLevi’s Brand x NikeThis summer, Levi’s and Nike are joining forces to make the shoe of the summer: Air Max 95s in distressed blue denim. Additionally offering the iconic silhouette in ecru and black (complete with red Levi’s label), the collaboration also includes a light-wash trucker jacket and baggy jeans with Nike swoosh embroidery. Plus, the shoes come with red, black, and white laces so you can choose the look that fits best with your aesthetic.Available to shop on July 10 at Levi'sCharlotte Tilbury Unreal Lips Healthy Glow Nectar Oil It’s summer and that means one thing: juicy lips. If you’re searching for a nostalgic hit, look no further than Charlotte Tilbury’s latest offering — a squeezy tube lip gloss. Available in six fruity fragrances from strawberry to coconut water, the lip oils lend a sheer tint and contain skin-boosting ingredients like hydrating hyaluronic acid, moisturizing vitamin E, and antioxidant-rich fruit oils that also give a shiny, hydrated finish to the lips. Our favorite is Juicylicious Cherry Glaze for a subtle just-bitten lip look.Available to shop on July 10 at Charlotte Tilbury Uniqlo Launches Third Studio Ghibli CollaborationBack in 2022, Uniqlo and cinematic powerhouse Studio Ghibli joined forces to create their first collaborative collection. Now, the popular Japanese label is back with a third drop showcasing artwork from some of the studio’s most beloved films. Featuring 14 pieces, the collection includes a T-shirt with leafy bird imagery from The Boy and The Heron, a gray My Neighbour Totoro sweatshirt, and a pink ombre Tale of Princess Kaguya T-shirt. Bonus: The collection has a matching kids collection for those shopping for little ones, too.   Available to shop on July 10 at UniqloCeraVe Balancing Air Foam CleanserFrom the spot-busting SA Smoothing Cleanser to the creamy Hydrating Cleanser, CeraVe’s face washes are affordable and effective. Now, the wallet-friendly brand is launching the Balancing Air Foam Cleanser, which pulls oil, dirt, and impurities out of the skin \"like a magnet.\" Using glycolysine cleansing technology, the foam formula promises 24-hour hydration (thanks to ceramides and allantoin), meaning it won’t strip the skin barrier — all while providing eight-hour oil control. Available to shop now at UltaCeraVe Balancing Air Foam Facial Cleanser, $, available at UltaHuda Beauty Lip Contour StainA well-defined lip is a must and nothing takes the chore out of application like a felt-tip brush. Huda Beauty’s new Lip Contour Stain is easy to use, delivering a long-lasting lip stain that can be worn neatly as a liner, a blurred lip blush, or even as a full matte stain. Available in eight different shades, the product contains moisturizing argan oil and promises 12-hour wear thanks to its highly pigmented formula. Our favorites are Cinnamon, a rosy taupe shade, and Soft Nude for a \"your lips but better\" look.

The latest iteration of the beloved styler is powered by Dyson’s fastest and most powerful motor yet: the Hyperdymium™ 2. Giving users twice the air pressure (helping to wrap hair more easily), the new tool also promises to dry hair as fast as a full-performance hairdryer — but it’s the brand's most lightweight design yet. Even better, there are six attachments for different style options, and each one connects to the MyDyson™ app with the new i.d. Curl™ feature. This helps deliver consistent curls by automatically adjusting heat and airflow. Available to shop on July 8 at DysonAsos x Adidas Capsule - Embargo 3rd JulyBlending bespoke fabrics, embroidery and new colorways, the new Adidas x Asos collaboration puts a streetwear spin on the former’s key archive silhouettes. Comprised of 18 apparel pieces, our favorite from the collection is the cream Firebird track jacket with burgundy piping and floral prints — a perfect layering piece for summer nights in the city.Available to shop July 15 at AsosLike what you see?

    "title": "Huda Mustafa's Revenge Dresses Are the Real Bombshells on \"Love Island USA\"",

    "description": "Princess Diana in an off-shoulder minidress when Prince Charles went public with his affair. Mariah Carey in a hip-high slit after leaving a tumultuous marriage. Ariana Madix in a fiery-red cutout set in the wake of #Scandoval. And most recently, Huda Mustafa in a black mini lace cutout frock after being dumped by Jeremiah Brown on \"Love Island USA.\" The revenge dress isn't a new phenomenon, but it remains at the forefront of everyone's minds. Inspired by the black mini worn by the Princess of Wales in the 1990s, the modern revenge dress is fashion at its most communicative. It's bold, fitted in silhouette, and red or black in color. It boasts plunging necklines and conspicuous cutouts, high splits and open backs. It's a comeback story, rendered sartorially. Despite the revenge dress's enduring legacy, I always felt uneasy about it. How vengeful is a sultry dress anyway? A better act of revenge would be, well, cheating back, as Chloe Bailey sings. What's more, the concept of \"revenge dressing\" frames a woman's wardrobe and appearance as her primary weapons of power. What about revenge accomplishments? Revenge art? Revenge careers? Why is it that - after a woman's been wronged - the statement that really makes an impact revolves around how she looks? I also wasn't sold on the idea of dressing with the offending party in mind. Fashion is such a personal, intimate act for me; I get dressed based on my mood, my desires, my social calendar for the week. I don't want that process to be hijacked by someone else, let alone someone who caused me harm. [T]here's something empowering about the revenge dress. It speaks to the confidence of a woman who knows that her value goes far beyond how she was treated. But I learned - through experience - that there's something empowering about the revenge dress. It speaks to the confidence of a woman who knows that her value goes far beyond how she was treated. My revenge dress story is pretty typical. Three years ago, pre-pandemic, I found myself on the verge of a break up. We had been so in sync; we had amazing chemistry; we saw a future together with kids, pets, and even a few business ventures. But when I signed into his Netflix account, of all things, I saw a newly-created profile bearing another woman's name - someone he'd visited once to help her fix a broken water pipe, allegedly. I inquired about it, and our relationship quickly unraveled from there. He was belligerent and I was crushed. And the New Year's Eve party invite I had accepted a few days prior hung in the balance. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jessica C. Andrews (@dressupwithjess) I was not in the mood to dress up and be around people. But then I reconsidered; after all, I usually enjoy a night of revelry and I refused to let him take that away from me. I landed on a dress that encapsulated that mood perfectly. A sequin micro mini with exaggerated sleeves and a plunging neckline. It was just the boost I needed to feel like myself again. It's the same energy Tina Turner emanated when she stepped out in 1986 after leaving her abusive marriage. She donned a skin-tight leather Azzedine Alaïa gown with four cutouts down the side, her hair in a blonde spiky mullet. Becky G had a similar air of confidence as she posed in a black lace dress at the iHeartRadio Music Awards - on the same day her fiancé addressed cheating rumors. And even more recently, Mustafa wore a series of curve-hugging dresses after her match (Brown) traded her for a new bombshell on national television. Dressing for revenge is less about retaliation, and more a bold declaration of self-love. It's putting on a brave face and a tight cutout dress - and letting the world know that what happened to you didn't break you and will not define you. Keep scrolling to glean your own confidence from the best celebrity revenge moments of all time, from Princess Diana to Ariana Madix - and shop similar dresses to Mustafa's ensembles from the cult-favorite series.",

    "description": "Leave it to Kylie Jenner to have all eyes on her at a wedding that's not hers. Most recently, the Khy founder joined her sisters (Kendall Jenner and Kim Kardashian) and mom Kris Jenner at one of the most anticipated matrimonies of the year: Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez's wedding in Venice, Italy. Naturally, Kylie Jenner didn't hold back when it came to her looks for the three-day extravaganza - from a white-silver lingerie dress to a cleavage-baring black string bikini. As if showing up in a white dress to someone else's nuptials wasn't already an indicator, Jenner further cemented her role as the main character wedding guest with a classic yet commanding accessory - black sunglasses from Otra Eyewear. It was the perfect example of a fashion faux pas that paid off. The Gen Z entrepreneur wore the Kenny sunglasses from the Australian brand, which is set to be available as part of an upcoming collaboration with the Grandquist sisters launching later this summer on the label's site and Revolve. Of course Jenner gets first dibs on the unreleased item, but that doesn't mean you can't get the same vibe. The site offers other budget-friendly picks like the Otra Hazel Black Sunglasses ($65) and the Otra Ivy Black Sunglasses ($65) - both cat-eye frames that are ideal for everyday wear (or a wedding if you're a Jenner/Kardashian). Since I'm a shopping-obsessed editor and self-proclaimed sunglasses connoisseur, Jenner's accessory of choice piqued my interest. I found these similar options that are Kylie Jenner coded, and even more affordable. For the committed minimalist, consider these black frames that are sure to elevate your summer looks: the Aire Fornax 53mm Oval Sunglasses ($44) and the Le Specs Dream Lover 50mm Cat Eye Sunglasses ($85). And of course, Amazon has pieces that are just as chic and Bezos wedding-worthy, like the YMFRW Retro Cat Eye Sunglasses ($8, originally $15) and the Vanlinker Small Polarized Cat Eye Sunglasses ($14).
