    "description": "After a busy February, another fashion month is coming to an end. Paris Fashion Week, which wraps the fall/winter 2025 showcases on March 11, is bringing the stylish festivities to a close. Following Vaquera and Dior kicking off PFW and debuts from creative directors at Dries Van Noten and Tom Ford, there are still some big names set to take over runways — think Louis Vuitton, Miu Miu, and Chanel  — and, rest assured, crowds of models, designers, editors, content creators, and other industry pros are showing up and out dressed to impress in their best street style looks.  As usual, Paris Fashion Week attendees are doing what they do best: putting effortlessly stylish spins on the year’s biggest trends in a way that only they can. Think: modern-day LBDs, silhouettes that are just the right amount of oversized, extravagant coats, playful peep-toe shoes, ethereal organza, and so much more. Everywhere you look, there’s spring outfit inspiration to be found, whether in the form of styling hacks, new pieces to add to your closet, reinterpretations of well-worn staples, or just overall vibes. Scroll on to discover our favorite Paris Fashion Week street style looks from the fall/winter 2025 shows, and keep checking back as we update this post with more looks throughout the week.

    "description": "Meghan Markle's style evolution is one for the books. While she's always been fashion-forward and chic, she's now evolved into one of our generation's most influential dressers. From her \"Suits\" wardrobe to her entry into the royal family, Markle's outfits inspire plenty of admirers and imitators across the globe. Back in 2006, Markle appeared on \"Deal or No Deal\" wearing minidresses with a body-con silhouette. What followed was seven seasons of \"Suits,\" when the actress attended Hollywood and fashion parties alike, embracing the season's hottest trends, from bandage dresses to gladiator heeled sandals. When she began dating Prince Harry, her fashion sense changed most dramatically, as she mellowed her red carpet look a bit in favor of a more conservative aesthetic fit for a royal. With a wedding gown designed by Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy, Markle cemented her place in the pages of the fashion history books. For the many official events that followed, she adhered to royal dressing protocol at times, but she also challenged it, embracing nail polish, off-the-shoulder necklines, and more. She also paid close attention to her color palette, staying away from bright colors in favor of neutral tones that wouldn't draw attention away from the more senior royals. As the end neared for her time as a working royal, Markle's style shifted yet again: her last formal royal appearances included vibrant hues like monochrome red and green. Once Markle officially resumed life as a private citizen, her style changed again. To raise her two children in California, she curated a more casual but classic wardrobe of jeans and button-down shirts. For red carpet events, the mother of two embraces a bolder aesthetic, experimenting with everything from pink short suits to gold cutout dresses. On her down time, or when she's cooking in her kitchen for her Netflix show, \"With Love, Meghan,\" the duchess embraces a coastal, Bohemian vibe with light-colored, breezy separates. Ahead, shop her latest style moments then keep scrolling to check out her full fashion evolution - from body-con dresses to cape gowns.",
