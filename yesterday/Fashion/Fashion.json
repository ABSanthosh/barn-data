    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/birkenstock-shearling-lined-clogs-review-49421502",
    "description": "If you're like me and you couldn't find a pair of Birkenstock's Boston Soft Footbed Clogs in your preferred size and color a couple of seasons ago, it may have been for the best. Turns out, the shearling-lined fall- and winter-friendly iteration of the brand's popular clog is softer, cozier, and more comfortable than the Boston Soft Footbed Clogs. I pounced on buying Birkenstock's Boston Genuine Shearling Lined Clogs ($175) as soon as they appeared in Nordstrom's new arrivals section, and I've been wearing them nonstop. What I Love About Birkenstock's Shearling-Lined Clogs They feel like a fuzzy slipper but have the ergonomic design and comfortable yet sturdy footbed that Birkenstock's Boston clogs are known for. I was initially worried that the shearling lining might make my feet sweat, but unlike synthetic versions, genuine shearling is naturally temperature-regulating. On warmer days or when I quickly need to slip into something, I've worn them barefoot, but they also manage to look cool with a quarter sock on chillier days. When our editor reviewed the version without shearling, she was expecting them to be comfortable but was surprised by how versatile they are as well. I've been thrilled to discover the same thing as I've thrown these shearling-lined mules on with everything from leggings and sweats to barrel jeans and even a jumpsuit. As far as convenience goes, I love that I can put them on hands-free. As a mom of two little ones and a brand-new puppy, they've become my go-to for 6 a.m. potty breaks when I'm half-asleep and my hands are occupied with a leash, treats, and a squirming pup. What's Worth Noting About Birkenstock's Shearling-Lined Clogs At $175, they're an investment and pricier than Birkenstock's Boston Soft Footbed Clogs, but the shearling is a worthy upgrade. I opted for the taupe color which has a tonal aesthetic with the matching suede and shearling. I like that the color isn't too light or dark, but I was concerned about getting them stained with dirt and water. Amazingly enough, they still look practically new despite how much I've been wearing them. I've gotten clumps of dirt on them but have been able to easily brush the dirt off. I've even gotten caught in an unexpected sprinkle and the raindrops didn't stain the suede either. Who Are Birkenstock's Shearling-Lined Clogs Best For? Whether you want a pair of shoes that are comfortable and easy or are more concerned with crafting an effortless aesthetic, you'll be equally pleased. If you have sheepskins draped over furniture or a favorite pair of shearling-lined boots, these versatile shoes are a no-brainer. Additional Details About Birkenstock's Shearling-Lined Clogs If you're between sizes, order the next size up. These are built on a unisex shoe construction, but the sizes reflect women's shoe sizes. They have an adjustable strap with a buckle closure. They have a contoured footbed with arch support. Where Are Birkenstock's Shearling-Lined Clogs Available? You can buy these clogs at Nordstrom, Amazon, and Birkenstock. Rating: Angela Elias (she/her) is a contributing editor for PS Shopping.
