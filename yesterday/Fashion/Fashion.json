    "description": "Fashion and film lovers — tonight is officially your night. The 97th Academy Awards is here and with that comes arguably one of the best red carpets of the year. After an awards season that brought a variety of sartorial looks, from old Hollywood odes at the Emmys, and serious tonal dressing at the Golden Globes (where actress Zendaya subtly debuted her engagement to BF Tom Hiddleston), to an LBD takeover at the most recent SAG Awards, it all ends tonight with celebs pulling out their best — and often most daring — looks of the season. This is, after all, the awards show that gave us Celine Dion in a backwards white John Galliano suit, Halle Berry in a sheer red Elie Saab number, Natalie Portman in a statement-making Dior cape, and Cher in a truly gravity-defying Bob Mackie look. And so far, this year’s red carpet is awash with floral, from a surprising group — the men of the red carpet. From Wicked star (and all around hunk)) Jeff Goldblum and South Korean singer Rowoon donning unique flowers on their lapels, to the iconic June Squibb sporting a sequined garden on her gown, it’s clear that — at least on the red carpet — spring is in full bloom. Here are our favorite looks from the Oscars red carpet.Da'Vine Joy RandolphPhoto: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images.Queen LatifahPhoto: Savion Washington/Getty Images.Lily-Rose DeppLily-Rose Depp in Chanel.Photo: Mike Coppola/Getty Images.Monica BarbaroPhoto: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images.Mikey MadisonMikey Madison in Dior.Photo: Arturo Holmes/WireImage.Michelle YeohMichelle Yeoh in Balenciaga.Photo: Mike Coppola/Getty Images.Halle BerryHalle Berry in Christian Siriano.Photo: Savion Washington/Getty Images.Colman DomingoColman Domingo in Valentino.Photo: Mike Coppola/Getty Images.Miley CyrusMiley Cyrus in Alexander McQueen.Photo: Frazer Harrison/WireImage.Ava DuvernayPhoto: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images.Doja CatDoja Cat in Balmain.Photo: Frazer Harrison/WireImage.Emma StoneEmma Stone in Louis Vuitton.Photo: Mike Coppola/Getty Images.Timothée ChalametTimothée Chalamet in Givenchy.Photo: Monica Schipper/Getty Images.Rachel ZeglerPhoto: Frazer Harrison/WireImage.Marissa BodePhoto: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images.Margaret QualleyMargaret Qualley in Chanel.Photo: Frazer Harrison/WireImage.Lena WaithePhoto: Mike Coppola/Getty Images.Coco GauffPhoto: Monica Schipper/Getty Images.Cynthia ErivoCynthia Erivo in Louis Vuitton.Photo: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images.Anok YaiAnok Yai in Marni.Photo: Arturo Holmes/WireImage.LisaLisa in Markgong.Photo: Mike Coppola/Getty Images.Demi MooreDemi Moore in Armani Privé.Photo: Mike Coppola/Getty Images.Selena GomezSelena Gomez in Ralph Lauren.Photo: Mike Coppola/Getty Images.Lupita Nyong'oLupita Nyong'o in Chanel.Photo: Mike Coppola/Getty Images.Zoe Saldaña Zoe Saldaña in Saint Laurent.Photo: Mike Coppola/Getty Images.Ana de ArmasAna de Armas in Alexandre Vauthier.Photo: Savion Washington/Getty Images.Felicity JonesFelicity Jones in Armani.Photo: Frazer Harrison/WireImage.Storm ReidStorm Reid in Alexandre Vauthier.Photo: Monica Schipper/Getty Images.Mindy KalingPhoto: Monica Schipper/Getty Images.Elle FanningElle Fanning in Givenchy.Photo: Monica Schipper/Getty Images.Joe Alwyn Photo: Mike Coppola/Getty Images.Ariana GrandeAraina Grande in Schiaparelli.Photo: Monica Schipper/Getty Images.Raffey CassidyRaffey Cassidy in Loewe.Photo: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images.Fernanda TorresFernanda Torres in Chanel.Photo: ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images.Rachel SennottRachel Sennott in Balenciaga.Photo: Mike Coppola/Getty Images.Coco JonesPhoto: ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images.Whoopi GoldbergWhoopi Goldberg in Christian Siriano.

    "description": ".disclaimer{width:90%;margin-bottom:1rem}.disclaimer__lines{width:100%;margin:0 auto;border-bottom:1px solid #999;padding:0;max-width:150px}.disclaimer__copy{width:100%;max-width:355px;font-family:Brown Regular,sans-serif;font-size:.9rem;font-weight:300;line-height:1.3em;color:#333;padding:0 0 .4rem;margin:1rem auto;text-align:center} All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. If 2024 was defined by leopard print, 2025 will be the year of cow spots. Let us explain. Last fall, Google searches for “cow print” hit a peak, perhaps because of the Western fashion comeback for the last several seasons. All of a sudden, there was more cow-print outfit inspiration on our Pinterest feeds, plus more cow-print clothing and accessory options in retail. (I personally wore a calfhair top-handle bag and cow-print Mary Jane flats for NYFW.) With festival season and Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter tour on the horizon, we only expect for it to become even more mainstream. Don’t get us wrong, leopard is still and will forever be going strong (see: the Fall/Winter 2025 NYFW collections and most recent Fashion Month street style). But we’re also seeing loads of faux fur, snakeskin, zebra stripes, and other animal patterns. Cow prints, though, might be the most playful and youthful one of the bunchWe’ve scoured the internet for the best pastoral-inspired fashion on the market — cow-print shoes, bags, jackets, dresses, and jeans — so you can get ahead of the trend. DashDividers_1_500x100 Cow-Print Shoes The easiest way to sport such a bold print is through accessories, since they can make a big statement on a smaller scale. We also found that shoes make up the most cow-printed fashion on the market — from rustic cowboy boots and chic kitten heels to preppy chunky loafers and bold running sneakers — making it extra easy to step into (get it?!) the trend. You can even choose between vegan printed fabrics or genuine calf hair styles with furry textures. DashDividers_1_500x100 Cow-Print Bags We’re seeing many mini, shoulder, and top-handle cow-print bags, both bold black-and-brown patterns and small spots. I personally own two cow-print top-handle purses and find them to be as wearable and versatile as leopard ones. (And, no, they don’t err too Western.) DashDividers_1_500x100 Cow-Print Jackets No, you don’t have to be a cowboy to confidently walk around in a cow-print jacket. There are several sleek faux fur coats and shearling vests boasting the pattern that are perfect for the winter, as well as many playful denim jackets for transitional dressing. We predict that the latter will especially be popular throughout festival season. DashDividers_1_500x100 Cow-Print Dresses Slip into a dress covered in an all-over cow print this spring, because go big or go home, right? Whether you opt for a flirty mini, classy midi, or slinky maxi dress, you can style this statement piece with complementary black and brown accessories, or treat the spotted print like a neutral and add pops of color. DashDividers_1_500x100 Cow-Print Jeans Much like how leopard-print jeans exploded in popularity, we think cow-print denim will be all the rage in 2025. Again, there’s a large range of colors and sizes, as well as both realistic and cartoonish renderings of the pattern. You can find them across fits, from skinny and straight to barrel-leg, and wide-leg. Style them with a matching printed jacket, or keep your top half simple with a solid that lets your pants shine.

    "description": "I'm trying to be more mindful about how and where I spend my money these days, while also making a conscious effort to support Latine entrepreneurs, creators, and business owners as often as possible. Latine fashion designers and clothing brands are not something we hear about often, but they exist and are out here making some seriously stylish and thoughtful clothing. There was definitely a time when even the idea of buying clothes, shoes, and accessories from a Latine-owned shop, let alone created by Latine designers, wasn't even on the radar, largely because representation was severely lacking. But now, we know that sometimes in order to support each other, we have to do a little digging and find those small businesses ourselves. And celebrities are getting in on the fun, from Mariah Carey in Flor de Maria heels to Blue Ivy Carter carrying a Ciriaco leopard print bag at the Super Bowl.

    "description": "Tate Modern, London The late Australian performance artist’s huge retrospective is packed with outlandish costumes, stylish photographs, emotive writing and evocative video footage, but what is most striking is his singular artistic visionLife was a guise to the performance artist Leigh Bowery (1961-94). His looks were so outlandish, his costumes so teemingly various, they jam every inch of this huge retrospective. He is a gilded boy-god, a Christmas pudding on legs, a prosthetised Venus of Willendorf. He is a leather-clad dame in a zipped-up mask or a Regency dandy in pistachio pantaloons, their orange polka dots spreading upwards all over his face.He fills the frame every time, in period photographs and videos, an enormous Australian with a shaved head and powerful calves, standing 6ft 3in and higher in towering platform soles painted scarlet or silver. Even though he is long gone, a sense of his colossal presence is apparent from the opening gallery, where a rack of Bowery’s earliest costumes gives an immediate sense of his size.
