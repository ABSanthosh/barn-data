    "description": "It’s worn by everyone from French mechanics to Harry Styles. What is it about the chore jacket that makes it so enduring – and can a modern version ever be truly authentic?Look around you and before too long you are likely to spot a chore jacket. I saw a particularly fine example on a dad last weekend at a heritage railway. As warm days stretch into still-cold evenings, beer gardens are full of them. They are worn down allotments and in towns, and I have a few in my own wardrobe. Because what began as everyday workwear for French factory employees more than a century ago has today become a wardrobe stalwart. You can even find chore jackets in the supermarket, with Sainsbury’s Tu and Asda’s George offering the cheapest – the simple design lends itself to mass production.They march across my Instagram feed, from workwear-inspired brands LF Markey, Folk or Uskees, down through high street stores such as Zara and John Lewis, as well as at hyper-expensive label The Row – your French machinist might have muttered a piquant “dis donc!” at its chore, with pockets too close together and a £1,500 price tag. The jacket has been worn by the likes of Brooklyn Beckham and Hailey Bieber, while Harry Styles is often seen in a version by SS Daley, the label inspired by British class tensions (and in which he has a financial stake).

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-bubble-skirts?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Bubble hems had their breakout moment last year. But if you thought they were a fleeting trend, think again. What started with a few puffed-up skirts and dresses in the fall of 2024 has officially snowballed into a full-blown takeover: bubble-hem tops, shorts, matching sets — you name it. But if you’re a purist (or just love a good aughts throwback), the bubble skirt remains the gold standard for making a voluminous statement. Designers have doubled down for spring 2025, delivering everything from Chloé’s dreamy high-low dresses to Alaïa’s sculptural duvet-like skirts, diaphanous draped versions at Stella McCartney, and cocktail-ready takes (hello, wedding guest season) at Emilia Wickstead and Dries Van Noten. The best part? Bubble skirts are surprisingly wearable and easy to style. Pair a midi with a simple tank and loafers, layer a mini with a spring jacket and ballet flats, or throw one on with sneakers and a sweater tossed over your shoulders (so street style coded)  — the drama’s built in.  Ahead, 16 bubble-hem skirts and dresses that’ll have you swishing through spring and beyond. Bubble Hem Mini Dresses From Free People’s bright red stunner to Reformation’s gingham drop-waist and Gap’s tie-strap mini, these bubble-hemmed dresses deliver maximum impact with minimal effort. Crisp cottons, airy prints, and easy silhouettes make them feel light, playful, and ready for every spring plan. Bubble Hem Mini Skirts The 2000s fashion favorite is officially back — and looking fresher than ever. Think utilitarian-inspired pleats, pinstripes, and pouffed-up color pops made for movement (and a good twirl). Bubble Hem Midi Dresses Bubble midis are getting the 2025 upgrade: dreamy draping, voluminous hems, and punchy tones built for sunny days and RSVP season alike. Whether you’re after floaty pastels, sleek sheers, or something in between, there’s a bubble midi for it. Bubble Hem Midi Skirts The silhouette that started with crisp black and white is getting a colorful refresh. This season’s bubble midis come in bright cottons, bold prints, and easy neutral shades, made for spring days, rooftop hangs, and everywhere else you want to make a sartorial statement.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-spring-sneakers-trends?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "The warm weather is begging us to lace up our shoes and start skipping, running, hiking, and dancing our way to summer. Enter: a fresh pair of spring sneakers — the perfect way to embrace a new season and refresh your wardrobe. While fall’s back-to-school season brought us bold sneaker trends like Mary Janes and nostalgic wedges, spring is ushering in loads of new statement-making pairs. Some, like leopard prints and platform soles, have endured from last year, while others — think boxing sneakers and shoe charms — are stepping into the spotlight and earning their place in your rotation. Read on for the seven spring sneaker trends that’ll be everywhere over the next few months, plus the best styles to shop now. DashDividers_1_500x100 Ballerina Sneakers On the feet of the popular coquette aesthetic, the ballet sneaker (aka “sneakerina”) trend is dominating this spring season. The whimsical It-girl-approved shoe has many interpretations, from slim ballet flats with rubber soles to sneakers with satin finishes and hybrid styles with Mary Jane straps and lace-up cords. After you pick the perfect pair, you’ll find yourself dancing throughout the season. DashDividers_1_500x100 Silver Sneakers Metallic sneakers have been trending for a while, but this spring, the focus is all on silver. From slim, sporty silhouettes to cushy, chunky soles, brands are embracing chromatic finishes in every form. Need more convincing? Cecilie Bahnsen just debuted a new Asics silver sneaker collab at Paris Fashion Week, proving just how versatile this metallic can be, dressed up or down with any outfit. DashDividers_1_500x100 High-Top Sneakers Queue the Rocky theme music — boxing-style sneakers are officially in the ring. And yes, you can wear them whether you’re training for a match or just making a statement. This might be the boldest take on the retro-meets-sporty sneaker resurgence. Whether you score a pair from an athletic brand or a high-fashion house, there’s no shortage of standout styles, especially in spring-ready shades like pink and yellow. You can also lean into the high-top trend with basketball-inspired kicks. Style them with classic athleisure or spring dresses for a knockout look. DashDividers_1_500x100 Animal Print Sneakers Yes, animal print — especially leopard spots — is still going strong in 2025. But to stay ahead of the trend curve, there are a few more patterns to keep on your radar this spring. Our prediction? Going all-in on cow print with sneakers as part of the equation. Trendy snakeskin and zebra stripes are also making waves across both lifestyle and athletic sneakers, including fun pops of color for a truly wild approach. DashDividers_1_500x100 Hiking Sneakers Hiking sneakers aren’t just for the trails — they’ve been hitting the streets, especially during Fashion Month. Translation: You don’t have to be an avid nature enthusiast to embrace their rugged aesthetic. Features like supportive and cushioned insoles, grippy outsoles, and durable waterproof materials make them an all-around win for days you’re clocking 10K steps or more. And thankfully, the era of clunky, not-so-cute hiking shoes is long gone. Vibrant, retro-inspired color combos and versatile neutrals lean into the “dad sneaker” vibe with a fashion-forward twist.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Platform Sneakers Okay, platform sneakers never really went out of style, but right now, they’re majorly in. While suede Isabel Marant wedge sneakers made a comeback in fall 2024, we’re betting on souped-up classics this season, especially tried-and-true white versions as the look. Whether you go for a sleek, minimalist pair or a chunky, futuristic take, consider it the perfect way to dodge spring puddles in style. DashDividers_1_500x100 Sneaker Charms Bag charms have been stealing the spotlight — think beaded keychains, mini plushies, and coin purses — but now it’s time to give shoe charms their moment. Because let’s be honest, your sneakers deserve a little razzle-dazzle, too! From jewelry-inspired accents to quirky baubles and statement laces, these decorative add-ons usually come in sets, so you can mix, match, and customize to your heart’s content. Options abound, from beaded bows and vintage-y trinkets to shoelace clips and more. Like what you see?

    "description": "When it comes to comfortable pants, you shouldn't have to sacrifice comfort for style. We're making it a goal to invest less in jeans and more in pants and trousers (chic sweatpants also work!) that are not only bearable to wear all day long but also look good. Although we love the look of a cool suit, putting an outfit together can feel overwhelming at times. For those not quite sure where to start, we'd recommend any of these 11 pairs. Thankfully, a lot of our favorite selections are also marked down - leading you to affordable must haves that will become mainstays and wardrobe essentials in your closet. Whether you're looking for something you can rock around the house, an option to wear on date night, or even comfortable pants to update your favorite work outfit, we've got you covered on all fronts. The best part: prices start at $30, so you can get something in your budget, too. We're especially loving all the wide-leg trousers, some lightweight styles that are great for traveling, and cool flared pants that give us a '60s and '70s vibe we can't wait to wear all season.

    "description": "It was only months ago that Kendrick Lamar told the world to pop out in his controversial, chart-topping diss track to Drake \"Not Like Us,\" and he's been at the top of our playlists ever since. Prior to both artists' rap beef, the Compton-born lyricist has consistently produced cultural records that amplify the Black experience from \"Alright\" and \"Humble\" to \"Father Time\" and \"Dodger Blue\" - even earning him a spot at this year's Super Bowl halftime Show (his performance being the most watched in history). Whether you've been a faithful K-dot fan for years or you're a newbie, there's no questioning his imprint on the music industry. Apart from his unrivaled flow and thought-provoking lyrics, we're even more excited about his joint tour with Grammy-winning singer and longtime collaborator SZA. The dynamic duo's \"Grand National Tour,\" which was announced just days after the aforementioned history-making halftime show, includes 39 shows across North America and Europe starting April 19. Of course, news of a tour can only mean one thing, besides singing your heart out: shopping. And while the rapper might not have been referencing clothing in the indicting record (sorry Drake fans), we're taking it as our sign to do exactly that with our outfits for the tour - pop out - and, well, you know the rest. Similar to their careers, both artists' styles have enjoyed an evolution that's worth taking notes from. Lamar depicts pride for his homeland with many of his looks, from the Balenciaga bomber, flare jeans, and New Era LA Dodgers hat combination he donned on the \"GNX\" album cover to the Maison Margiela Canadian tuxedo he wore to the 2025 Grammys (a look fitting for winning five awards in one night). Meanwhile, the R\u0026B songstress is a sartorial chameleon with a penchant for sultry silhouettes. She's worn everything from Jaded London plaid minis to archive designer frocks; like her 2024 Met Gala afterparty outfit that consisted of a plunging purple-and-green Versace dress from the house's spring/summer 2004 collection. Whether you want to nail one of your favorite ensembles piece by piece or are just in need of a new trucker hat, we've done all the legwork to ensure that your \"Grand National Tour\" look is Lamar- and SZA-approved. Keep reading to shop our top picks for the best \"Grand National Tour\" outfits, with selects inspired by the duo and exact pieces they've worn.",
