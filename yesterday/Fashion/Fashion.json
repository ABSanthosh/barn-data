    "description": "From a classy trouser suit to a rebellious dash of colour against the grey, brave dressing will embolden you in today’s uncertain worldI’ve been thinking a lot about something the fashion designer Bella Freud said recently, which was that she aims to create clothes that make you feel intrepid. This was such a nice way of expressing what great clothes do, which is not just to give you confidence, but also to connect you to the world. What you wear is the membrane between you and, well, everything else. Good clothes make you feel comfortable within your skin, and they can also make you feel like a player.Fashion to make you feel intrepid comes in many different forms, and looks different for each of us. A jumpsuit makes me feel so brave that I could jump out of a plane. (I could never, ever jump out of a plane. But it’s a nice fantasy to inhabit, as I zip myself up.) A trouser suit can be brilliant: very armoured, but very civilised. Night-out dressing requires its own kind of bravery: you are, after all, taking a leap into the dark. Continue reading...",

    "description": "On Sunday, millions of people will tune into the 82nd Golden Globe Awards for the annual star-studded occasion and the official kickoff of this year’s awards season. And, of course, red carpet fashion will be all the talk as we also start the new year.In celebration of this red carpet's return, we're looking back decades to show off the best red carpet looks from each year between 2024 to 1989 — that is, except for 2008, when the Writers Guild of America went on strike and the whole event was canceled, and 2022, when backlash against the Hollywood Foreign Press put the award ceremony on hold.From the white satin gown Audrey Hepburn donned while receiving the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1990 and Saoirse Ronan's #METOO-inspired black Versace gown in 2018 to Michelle Yeoh’s proof that the peplum is back in 2023, these are the best looks we've seen in over three decades of the Golden Globes.2024Past Lives star Greta Lee looked breathtaking on the red carpet in this billowing, draped-back bespoke gown by Loewe.Greta Lee in Loewe.Photo: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images.2024Hi Barbie!

Not only did she win her very first Golden Globe for a stunning performance in Lady Bird, but she also shut the red carpet down in this stunning black and silver Atelier Versace gown.Saoirse Ronan in Atelier Versace.Photo: Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images.2017Draped in Chanel Couture, Riley Keough might have been new to the Golden Globes in 2017, but she looked anything but out of place on the red carpet.Riley Keough in Chanel Couture.Photo: Steve Granitz/WireImage.2016Anyone can do Old Hollywood, but no one, and we mean no one, does it quite like Lady Gaga. With a Marilyn Monroe 'do that rivals Ms. Monroe herself, this off-the-shoulder Versace gown and 10-inch Brian Atwood heels, we find ourselves wondering, is there anything Gaga can't do?Lady Gaga in Versace.Photo: Jason Merritt/Getty Images.2015Wearing black on the red carpet is hardly groundbreaking, but Amal Clooney has a way of standing out in a crowd, especially when she's donning head-to-toe Dior Haute Couture.Amal Clooney in Dior Haute Couture.Photo: George Pimentel/WireImage.2014For a Golden Globes first-timer, Lupita Nyong'o walked this red carpet like a seasoned pro — or rather, a superhero, in this cape-like gown by Ralph Lauren.Lupita Nyong'o in Ralph Lauren.Photo: Steve Granitz/WireImage.2013Patchwork has never looked better than it did in 2013 on Zoe Saldaña in this Prabal Gurung strapless frock.Zoe Saldaña in Prabal Gurung.Photo: Steve Granitz/WireImage.2012We've yet to spot Angelina Jolie looking anything short of fabulous on the red carpet circuit, but this show-stopping Atelier Versace gown is hands down her best.Angelina Jolie in Atelier Versace.Photo: George Pimentel/WireImage.2011Low back! Sequins! Long sleeves! All boxes were checked when Anne Hathaway stepped foot on the red carpet in this Armani Privé gown.Anne Hathaway in Armani Privé.Photo: Evan Agostini/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty Images.2010A few showers couldn't stop Cameron Diaz (and that dazzling smile) from showing up her competition in this drapey Alexander McQueen gown.Cameron Diaz in Alexander McQueen.Photo: SGranitz/WireImage.2009Admittedly, lavender in January might seem bold, but when it's Olivia Wilde underneath this Reem Acra gown, all bets are off.Olivia Wilde in Reem Acra.Photo: Steve Granitz/WireImage.2007Not that there's anything Queen Bey doesn't look stunning in, but even she outdid herself with this gold, sequined Elie Saab number.Beyoncé in Elie Saab.Photo: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images.2006Looking back on 2006 style, it hardly seems possible that Keira Knightley's strapless Valentino dress came out of the same year as chunky belts and low-rise cargo pants.Keira Knightley in Valentino.Photo: Jeff Vespa/WireImage.2005As the mastermind behind Poise magazine (calling all 13 Going on 30 fans!), it comes as no surprise that Jennifer Garner (with the help of this vintage Valentino gown) would beat out any and all competition on the red carpet.Jennifer Garner in vintage Valentino.Photo: SGranitz/WireImage.2004While this look might not have garnered very much appreciation back in '04, we're still tipping our hats to the master of menswear, Diane Keaton, for showing up to the Golden Globes donning a collared white coat, itty bitty sunglasses and sequin boots.Diane Keaton in Nehru-collared white coat.

Then again, we're still looking for something Halle Berry doesn't look perfect in.Halle Berry in Valentino.Photo: SGranitz/WireImage.2001A slip dress to the Golden Globes? Normally we'd say no way, but there's just something about Kate Hudson in Vera Wang that has us tossing normal red carpet rules out the window.Kate Hudson in Vera Wang.Photo: KMazur/WireImage.2000At the height of Sex and the City's prime, it hardly comes as a surprise that fashion icon Sarah Jessica Parker, would show up looking fabulous on the red carpet. We only wish she'd give us a hint to what shoes she's wearing underneath this Richard Tyler tulle gown.Sarah Jessica Parker in Richard Tyler.Photo: Frank Micelotta/Getty Images.1999Typically we'd shudder at the thought of a two-piece ensemble on the red carpet, but this Pamela Dennis black-and-white duo on Calista Flockhart has us making a special exception.Calista Flockhart in Pamela Dennis.Photo: SGranitz/WireImage.1998What is it everyone says?

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Something you should know about me: I love a square-toe boot and own quite a few pairs. With its sleek and unexpected shape, the silhouette can quickly bring me into chic work mode or grunge moto boot territory depending on the style. Based on trending Google terms, lots of you love the retro-esque style as well: Searches for “black square toe boots” and “leather square toe boots” are surging as are other notable variations, such as cowboy boots and knee-high boots. From slim lace-up styles and micro heels fit for the office to Western styles and chunky soles perfect for gallivanting through the winter landscapes,  we found the very best square-toe boots for the cold-weather season. Just scroll on to find the exact silhouette that matches your style — or that pushes it to the fashion limit! DashDividers_1_500x100 Square-Toe Cowboy \u0026 Western Boots Perhaps you carted up a pair of pink or metallic cowboy boots this past summer during Taylor Swift’s extended Eras Tour or Chappell Roan’s festival performances. But if you haven’t yet, we present you with square-toe styles that will have you channeling the “Beyoncé Bowl” this winter. Go for genuine, sturdy cowboy boots from brands like Ariat and Frye for a timeless workforce pair or buckled moto styles to hone in on the Western fashion trend in a more subtle way.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Square-Toe Ankle Boots Ankle boots are a wardrobe staple — in particular, square-toe ankle boots, which offer an extra edge thanks to their unique shape, whether they’re on the chunkier or the slimmer side. We love a tried-and-true leather boot with short block heels (extra points if the heels are angular), which are a sturdy option for the winter. But you can also find this boot shape with dainty kitten heels or on-trend animal prints for more upscale occasions.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Square-Toe Knee-High Boots Everyone needs a pair of knee-high boots. The versatile shoe simply looks great with mini dresses and tights, midi skirts, or even tucked under wide-leg jeans for extra warmth. Whether you’re looking for a platform or a sleek stiletto, there are plenty of square-toe boots to choose from. You can go as bold or tame as you want, playing with fabric, color, and heel shape. (And if you have thicker calves, like myself, don’t sleep on the Dolce Vita extra-wide-calf boots.) DashDividers_1_500x100 Square-Toe Work Boots If you’re on the hunt for office-appropriate square-toe boots, you can’t go wrong with a pair of polished ankle boots. On work days, I regularly reach for my Vivaia square-toe boots (which I have in multiple colors) because of their soft sock-like fabric and comfortable block heels. But you can also opt for a higher heel or knee-high length depending on your work’s dress code.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Square-Toe Lace-Up Boots For lace-up boots, you can either go for a chunky combat pair or a delicate Victorian style. I personally can get behind both depending on the outing and outfit. But, no matter which way you sway, you’re bound to look stylish and feel super-empowered to stomp into the new year in these square-toe boots. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/New-Year-Eve-Underwear-Color-Meaning-36317927",
    "description": "How you end the year may influence how the entire year ahead turns out. Specifically, when we're talking style, some people believe the color underwear you choose for New Year's Eve could be potentially prophetic. Whether you're attending a party or lounging at home to watch the ball drop, if you want to put thought into the color of your panties and what that hue could symbolize, keep reading. The idea? Each color is associated with a specific quality you hope to embody in 2025. Founder of PSYKHE and fashion psychologist Anabel Maldonado explains that the superstition ties into the concept of \"enclothed cognition.\" This theory argues that how we dress informs our psychological processes, thoughts, and feelings. Two researchers at Northwestern University, Hajo Adam and Adam Galinsky, coined the concept after their studies showed that people wearing white doctor's coats were more attentive during a series of tasks than those wearing white painter's coats. The reason tied back to their prior assumptions about a doctor's heightened ability to focus. \"While the superstitions have a much more metaphysical interpretation - aka the color will magically make things happen for you - I believe our ancestors were just missing the middle step: the fact that if we think it and believe it, we're halfway there to what we desire,\" Maldonado says, sharing that some of the women she grew up with in her Latin culture wore red underwear on New Year's Eve for a good love life. Ahead, discover the different colors and what they are said to symbolize. Then, shop selects from popular lingerie brands once you decide what you're manifesting for 2025.

    "description": "Sweater weather has us reaching for all the cozy knits in our wardrobe, and Nordstrom is the perfect retailer for finding new additions. With loads of brands that range from affordable to luxury level, it's easy to find sweater options that fit within tight budgets or justify splurges. Aside from combing through Nordstrom's sweater inventory to include options at every price, we've also curated a variety of styles. From cropped cardigans perfect for layering to warm turtlenecks, and even short-sleeved sweaters and sweater vests, we found options you can wear with all sorts of outfits and weather forecasts. Choose from classic styles, like a cable-knit cardigan or a striped turtleneck, or shake it up with a checkered crew neck or a sequin-trimmed, short-sleeved style that can be layered under a blazer. There are so many cute options, you might want to consider buying several. Keep scrolling to see the sweaters we're adding to our fashion wish lists for winter.",
