    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/bestselling-skims-products-49378788",
    "description": "Skims went from an idea to an award-winning intimates and loungewear brand. Founded by Kim Kardashian and Jens Grede in 2019, the company was valued at $4 billion in July 2023, according to Forbes. Whether or not shoppers are Kardashian fans, the brand still seems to have go-to collections that continuously sell out. And its Fifth Avenue flagship store was unveiled in NYC on Dec. 12 (right on the heels of its five-year anniversary) with a special presentation and celeb-packed party. The Skims Fits Everybody line is made with a signature stretch fabric that truly is butter-soft (in fact, I'm wearing the classic thong right now and I describe it as feeling like \"nothing.\" In other words, it's a second skin). The Soft Lounge launch gave way to everyone's favorite long slip dress, which most people attest to be the most flattering body-conscious piece they own. And the Seamless Sculpt range provides every piece of shapewear you could possibly imagine layering underneath that slightly skin-revealing look you've been trying to figure out how to style. And then there's the nipple push-up bra that turns heads whenever I wear it and is a major bestseller. It should come as no surprise that you can now shop these pieces in person. Of course, Skims has been most notably praised for its sizing (XXS-4X) and incredible assortment of nude shades to complement skin tones. Its adaptive products feature added hook and eye closures and front clasps for accessibility, though the brand is overdue for introducing more styles. Nevertheless, if you're new to shopping Skims, we highly recommend you start with the top-rated picks that most folks rave about on social - and these 12 are it. Ahead, read up on the Skims bestsellers, and decide where to shop based on your color and size preferences. Skims is available online at skims.com, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Net-a-Porter, Ssense, and more.",
