    "description": "Sydney's most anticipated style event finally happened. Australian Fashion Week 2025, held at Carriageworks in Sydney last week, was one of the best fashion events of the year for Australia, with established and up-and-coming designers strutting their Resort 2025 collections in front of the sartorial elite, including top fashion editors, style influencers, and the world’s top buyers. While some incredible shows were on the list, including AFW debuts and off-site spectacles, we found that many of the biggest trends for the upcoming seasons could be seen outside the runways. Australian Fashion Week street style is renowned for setting trends and reflecting prominent fashion personalities, whether guests prefer classic minimalism, bold hues, or unique layering. Last year's AFW street style saw a wave of Australian designer threads, and this year was no different. As usual, the Australian fashion set delivered plenty of trans-seasonal looks that will definitely serve inspo for the months to come. Here are some of the best looks from Australian Fashion Week 2025.Best Street Style From Day 4 Of Australian Fashion WeekBest Street Style From Day 4 Of Australian Fashion WeekBest Street Style From

The online retailer always manages to offer a variety of cute and stylish pieces, most of which can be shopped at ridiculously low prices, too (love that for us!).

This winter, Amazon has already managed to outdo itself in the affordable fashion department, which is a feat in itself considering how notoriously great the retailer is through every season. With everything from comfortable jeans and shorts to dresses, handbags, and more, we know there's a lot to shop.

    "title": "3 Editors Tried Old Navy's New Affordable Dress Line - Here's What Stood Out",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/old-navy-occasion-dress-review-49443514",
    "description": "If you've found yourself gravitating toward Old Navy lately, it's not just you - and it's definitely not a coincidence. The brand that dominated the late '90s is having a serious style resurgence. Its pieces are more versatile, the accessories are genuinely stylish, and the new collections just make sense. (You can thank creative director Zac Posen for that.) One of the latest is called The Occasion - a new line of elevated dresses and separates made for special events. Think: summer weddings, rehearsal dinners, charity galas, and beyond. Basically, if there's a fancy moment on your calendar, Old Navy has you covered. Even better? The price point is as friendly as ever, with pieces ranging from $25 to $66. Available in sizes XS–4X and offered in seasonal prints, solids, and playful polka dots, we knew what we had to do: test it out ourselves. Three editors each picked a look (or two!) they loved - from a breezy two-piece set to a flouncy bubble dress and a sleek off-the-shoulder number. We wore them to events, around town, and yes, even while lounging at home. Safe to say, we got very familiar with these pieces - and we're not mad about it. Keep scrolling to see how each look held up IRL and to hear our honest thoughts. Spoiler: you might just want to add one (or a few) to your cart.",
