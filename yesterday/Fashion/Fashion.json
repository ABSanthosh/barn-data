    "description": "How to streamline your retail experience and go home with something you’ll actually wearWe all make mistakes. Mistakes are fine. The trick when shopping for clothes is to avoid making the same ones over and over again, because that can get dispiriting, and when it comes to purchases, mistakes can be expensive. Awful to spend the money and not feel the benefit. Not to mention the state of the planet. So, in the interests of not feeling like a broke, evil carbon-guzzler with nothing to wear, here are my golden rules of changing-room decision-making.1. Wear clothes without buttons – and slip on shoes Buying the right clothes starts with wearing the right clothes when you go shopping. You need to streamline your changing room manoeuvres. Wear shoes that you can slip off and on. If you are only looking at dresses, then wear a dress for speed; otherwise wear loose separates. You will have a better sense of whether that boho blouse works if you are trying it on with your favourite jeans, than standing there in your knickers. Also, pack a tote bag so that you aren’t buying bags and can comfortably carry any purchases on your shoulder. Continue reading...",

    "description": "If we could live in our out-of-office beachwear all day, everyday, we probably would — especially when the mercury has spiked and humidity makes ‘real’ clothes all too uncomfortable. Think, whimsical, tiered midi dresses that resemble Victorian nightgowns, linen palazzo pants that don’t constrict your legs, extra floaty “feels like nothing” skirts… Basically, clothing that’s as easy and breezy as we wish our surroundings were.Crochet dresses are one of summer’s key staples — right alongside breezy linen and lightweight cotton dresses, matching sets, and the kinds of easy pieces you’ll reach for on repeat. This season, they feel especially fresh thanks to updated takes that span from open-knit minimalist styles to colorful, embroidered designs and classic swimsuit coverups.Designers have leaned into both playful and pared-back interpretations — from fisherman-inspired netting to checkerboards and artisanal, hand-knit textures that feel more refined than retro. Whether you’re channeling a coastal European summer vibe (think a headscarf, raffia bag, and sunglasses) or styling for city life, these dresses deliver.Toss one on with sneakers for weekend errands or sightseeing, ordress it up with thong kitten heels or your go-to sandals. Whether you’re headed to a party, a picnic, or on vacation, the crochet dress belongs in your warm-weather rotation. Ahead, some of our favorites. DashDividers_1_500x100 Crochet Mini Dresses Crochet minis are the definition of throw-on-and-go. Their lightweight feel and shorter hemlines make them ideal for hot days, while the textured finish adds polish. From beach plans to casual nights out, these styles bring personality and playful energy to your warm-weather lineup — and make a strong case for showing some leg. Crochet Midi Dresses The midi is a summer go-to for a reason — long enough to feel styled, breathable enough to keep cool. Crochet adds a tactile feel to this universally flattering length, making it perfect for everything from weekend hangs to backyard parties. Wear it with ballet flats for an easy, French-inspired look, or layer it with a lightweight blazer if you’re navigating the office-to-outdoor balance. Crochet Maxi Dresses If you’re leaning into the fisherman aesthetic or European summer vibe, the maxi is your hero piece. These longer silhouettes feel relaxed yet directional — ideal for beach days, travel, or just catching a breeze on a hot city afternoon. Pair with heeled flip-flops, stacked jewelry, and sunglasses for an unfussy finish that still makes an impact. Like what you see?

    "description": "Your eyes are precious, so it’s important to keep ‘em as healthy and stylish as possible. On those supremely bright and sunny days, that means putting on a pair of trendy sunglasses to protect your delicate pupils from harmful UV rays, glare, dust — or paparazzi flashes when out with your digital camera friend.We know that the world of shaded eyewear can be overwhelming, with sunglasses coming in all sorts of shapes, sizes, and widths. That’s why we put together this mini guide to the best sunglasses to look out for, categorized by style, lens type, and activity — and with options for every budget. Whether you're looking for a pair of statement sunglasses for your next vacation, prescription glasses to give your eyes a rest from contacts, or colorful frames to match your wardrobe, there are plenty of options out there. We've even got you covered with polarized styles, sporty shades, and designs for wider faces. So, if one style doesn’t work for you, we guarantee there’s another pair of sunnies around the corner that will. Now, go forth and keep those rays at bay.All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.The Best Brands For Prescription SunglassesAs any glasses-wearer will know, shopping for a new pair of prescription sunglasses is a major decision. Not only are you committing to a pair of frames if and until your prescription changes, but it’s a choice that will cost you a pretty penny. This is why we’re such fans of Pair Eyewear, a brand all about choice and customization at affordable prices. You can choose from a variety of prescription frames — all starting at $70 — and select from hundreds of customizable “tops”; aka magnetic, flat frames that cover the front of your glasses to instantly change their appearance. This means that using the same stylish frame as a base, you can switch seamlessly between eyeglasses and sunglasses, or between different colored and patterned options — ideal for matching your specs to your outfit! (There are also plenty of sunglasses-only options available, too.)If you’re after a little more luxury, there are several other brands always on our rotation: Ace \u0026 Tate, Warby Parker, and Cubitts offer chic, stylish frames within the $100 to $300 price range.Pair Eyewear The Payton, $, available at Pair EyewearWarby Parker Lupin, $, available at Warby ParkerCubitts Grimaldi, $, available at Cubittsace \u0026 tate Selma, $, available at ace \u0026 tateThe Best Brands For Polarized SunglassHeard of polarized sunglasses but are not sure of their benefits?

    "description": "Reformation is a brand that's hard not to know. The sustainable Los Angeles-based fashion label is adored by the likes of Kendall Jenner, Meghan Markle, and Taylor Swift - along with countless others, including PS editors, and most likely, you. The brand's repertoire isn't known for just one thing. While its dresses are the ultimate fan favorite, Reformation's influence stretches far beyond that, with must haves in every category, from tops and bottoms to footwear, accessories, jewelry, and even the bestselling, '90s-inspired Cary jeans. But with price tags that mostly land in the three-dollar-sign range, a full Reformation shopping spree isn't always realistic. That's why we're all about choosing the right pieces, and why we've curated this guide to the brand's bestsellers for every Reformation lover, new or seasoned. Plus, lucky for us, Reformation is currently hosting a sale, with 25 percent off some of the label's cutest pieces. Ahead, we've rounded up the 17 best Reformation pieces to covet, from everyday dresses that'll take you from the office to happy hour to wedding guest dresses to tops that are perfect for layering.
