    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/jenee-naylor-style-essentials-49443892",
    "description": "The Expert Edit features interviews with specialists about the products they swear by in their chosen field. For the latest installment, we spoke to fashion and beauty expert Jeneé Naylor about her fashion product recommendations and must haves for maintaining a great wardrobe. You can't talk about influencers without mentioning Jeneé Naylor. If you're an OG fan like me, you may know her as \"High Low Luxxe,\" the alias under which she creates innovative fashion content, often mixing high-end finds with more affordable pieces. She can sport every outfit combination from a $30 pair of pants from Mango and a Loewe bag to H\u0026M shorts and Yves Saint Laurent sunnies - the \"ultimate high-low mixer,\" as she says. Although her coveted blog still holds this name, Naylor has evolved into one of the most sought-after voices in fashion and beauty, thanks to her decision to leave a career of fashion retail in 2019. Just a little over five years into full-time blogging, she's amassed a following of nearly 1.2 million supporters across her blog, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and most recently, her podcast \"Style Unlocked.\" And she's achieved it all by drawing on her natural inclination to share. \"I always worked in retail in some capacity, but I also just liked sharing,\" she says. \"If you saw me in the mall and you liked my pants, I would tell you where they're from and how much they cost; I love helping people, I love promoting people, and I love elevating people.\" Naylor's helpful nature has granted her access into some of the industry's biggest rooms, from hosting live shopping events with brands like Hanifa and Nordstrom to designing a collection with Target (the two retailers being her former places of employment). The biggest fashion tip I always share with people? Loving everything in your closet. [...] If you have things that kind of work, it just gets harder to get dressed because you're working overtime to make that one thing look good; if you have two blazers or dresses that you love, it becomes easier to get dressed. In a world full of endless trend cycles and short-lived fads, the St. Louis native credits her success to her lasting bond with her community. \"Anytime I need motivation or creativity, I go live because I get to connect with my audience; the reason I do what I do,\" she explains. \"I value natural community and ensure that I'm taking care of people in any room I enter, and they take care of me, sending opportunities that I'm typically not looking for and they just make sense. My audience cheers me on, so everything feels like the right place, the right time.\" And with this ethos, the creator couldn't be more aligned with her purpose. Her mission is affordable luxury, debunking the myth that great style and luxury experiences are out of reach based on one's income. Through her relatable content that includes product reviews, GRWMs, and a slew of editorial-level photoshoots to admire, she shows her audience that you can have the finer things in life, regardless of your tax bracket. It starts with building a capsule wardrobe you love. \"The biggest fashion tip I always share with people? Loving everything in your closet,\" she says excitedly. \"And I know that sounds impossible, but if you really think about it when you are purging things or going through different seasons, no matter what it is, you should really love it. If you have things that kind of work, it just gets harder to get dressed because you're working overtime to make that one thing look good; if you have two blazers or dresses that you love, it becomes easier to get dressed.\" Ahead, Naylor shares more brilliant tips for finding (or rebranding) your personal style, her favorite fashion and beauty purchases, and the white tank top she can't live without.",

    "description": "The Y2K era has dominated the sartorial food chain in recent years, from baguette bags and charmcore to crop tops and flared jeans. While we've enjoyed adding these items in abundance to our wardrobes, there's a new girl on the block who deserves our coins even more: the jort. Otherwise known as jean shorts that hit just above the knee or lower, the bottom has found its way to the top of our FYPs (once again), after taking over last summer. To no surprise, style stars and designers alike have cosigned jorts as the official it-piece to have in your wardrobe, from SZA and Hailey Bieber to the runways of Etro and Fiorucci during Milan Fashion Week's Spring 2025 season. And as with many other trends, the denim style dates back to the early aughts, with stars like Beyoncé having donned skinny jean jorts on many occasion and Madonna's casual looks often defined by long, oversized menswear jorts. All this to say, jorts are so back, and this is your sign to give into the fad. Far from a thing of the past, the comfortable bottom has evolved into many iterations, from playful prints to deconstructed waistlines - so there's truly something for everyone. Looking for a functional frayed pair for your summer escapades? Nordstrom's offerings fit the bill. And if you're on the hunt for a pair that can go from the office to date night with that special someone, we found the perfect pair from ASOS. Ahead, we've gathered the best jorts for every aesthetic and shape, from affordable finds to splurge-worthy pieces. Keep scrolling to shop our specially curated edit of jorts to instantly elevate your wardrobe this summer and beyond.",

    "description": "It’s 8:30 on a Tuesday morning at JFK’s Terminal 4, and Amanda Batula is between coasts — again. The Summer House star, Loverboy creative, and founder of Amanda Batula Swim is about to catch a flight to L.A., her second of three cross-country trips in less than a month. “I’ve been doing an insane amount of traveling,” she says, settling into a couch at the Marshalls Upgrade Lounge, a free pop-up space offering travelers snacks, a beauty bar, and a chic break from airport chaos through Memorial Day weekend. “I’m actually really surprised with how well I’ve handled it. Normally I crash after a trip, but I’ve just been on the move lately.” That momentum is something Batula doesn’t take for granted. Not long ago, even routine parts of travel — packing a bag, getting out the door, and making it to the airport — felt paralyzing. “I’d back out of things, or just lie in bed telling Kyle [Cooke] I couldn’t even start packing because I was so overwhelmed.” After being diagnosed with depression and anxiety in 2023, Batula began working with a psychiatrist and taking antidepressant medication. Now, tasks that once felt insurmountable have become manageable, which means Amanda is saying yes to events, trips, and work opportunities that she would have previously passed on. “I don’t get overwhelmed, it doesn’t take me a full day to pack. I can throw together a bag. It’s just so much easier,” Batula says. Between destination weddings, business opportunities, and influencer engagements, Amanda is a certified frequent flier — which makes her partnership with Marshalls feel especially well-timed. “The most stressful thing about traveling is getting to the airport, getting through security, and then rushing to your gate,” she says. “It’s nice to have a place where you can just come and feel zen, especially if you’re like me and don’t have access to other [paid] lounges.” In addition to the Upgrade Lounge pop-up, the retailer offers an online shopping hub that features a collection of travel-friendly fashion and lifestyle finds curated by Batula to make packing and on-the-go style feel a little less stressful.  The reality star, now in her eighth season of Summer House (Batula joined the cast full time in Season 2), is well-accustomed to splitting her summers between NYC and the Hamptons, and is starting to embrace being a bit more strategic about what she puts in her suitcase. “Kyle and I are notorious for bringing our whole closet, especially back when I was working corporate,” she says. “Now I try to stick to a few staples and plan according to the weekend. We’ll get a heads up about what the events are and then do a little shopping.”  As for sharing clothes with her castmates while filming? “I’m always willing to share. Paige [DeSorbo] will only pack for the weekend, so she doesn’t really have any other options to share, and Ciara [Miller] will always order clothes to the house and if you need an option she’ll give it to you.” Batula and I are meeting the day before the Summer House Season 9 finale aired, and naturally I ask about what’s next for the series, which typically films from July through August. Bravo fans and cast members alike have been speculating about the show’s future, including potential cast shakeups, but Batula doesn’t have much to offer in terms of clues. “There’s no news yet… but no news is usually good news,” she says. “We typically hear from production the week before filming starts, and half the time we get the address to the house the day of. You don’t even know what house we’re driving out to.” If past seasons are any indication, fans will have to wait until after the reunion episodes, which begin airing next week, for any concrete answers about Season 10. For those in-the-know, the reunion seating chart — and who sits next to host Andy Cohen — can be a subtle signal of who played a central role that season. Batula didn’t think much of it going into this year’s reunion, which filmed on April 24, until she showed up on set and saw where she’d been placed. “I was told by one of the crew members, ‘Oh, Amanda, you’re going to like your seat,’ thinking that like I was on the end, because that would be somewhere that I’d like to be sat,” Batula laughs. “And when I walked out, like being right next to [Cohen], I was like, I’m either in big trouble and I did something really wrong or I’m being rewarded. I think I was more shocked than everyone else that saw the leak of the seating arrangement. It was crazy. I was not expecting to sit there… but it was great for me. I had a great time.” The Upgrade Lounge by Marshalls is open May 21 through May 28 in JFK’s Terminal 4. Exclusive amenity kits will be available for visitors while supplies last. Like what you see?
