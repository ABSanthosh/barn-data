Now Mark Zuckerberg is shifting the styling focus to his left wrist. Announcing changes on Tuesday to Facebook and Instagram’s factchecking programmes , the Meta boss wore a $900k (£740k) watch from the Swiss brand Greubel Forsey. Hand-made using white gold, only three are created each year. It joins Zuckerberg’s growing horological collection including a $1.2m rose gold timepiece from Patek Philippe and the thinnest watch ever made.But while an accessory with upwards of a six-figure price tag may be something only tech billionaires can afford, Zuckerberg is tapping in to a growing trend: the return of the mechanical wristwatch and old school digital timepiece. The trend is being fuelled by gen Z (those born between 1997 and 2012), many of whom have never worn a wristwatch before, typically using their smartphone to keep track of the time.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Frost is nipping at our noses — which means our faux fur coats and knee-high boots are officially back in rotation. As your winter dresses make their seasonal debut, it’s the perfect time to refresh a few favorites. This season calls for cozy-luxe long-sleeve sweater dresses, sumptuous velvet styles, and maxi silhouettes that deliver warmth and coverage. Blazer dresses are having a major moment, too — ideal for everything from casual hangs and office hours. We even found styles perfect for date nights and winter weddings. Ahead, shop the best cool-weather picks from reader-favorite retailers like Free People, Nordstrom, and Aritzia. DashDividers_1_500x100 Sweater Dresses Whether you’re dressing for the office, a cozy dinner, a log cabin getaway, or a stroll and window shopping, a sweater dress has you covered. From lightweight jersey to plush cashmere and chunky knits, these versatile styles are equal parts warm and comfortable. We found a range of versatile styles, such as a cardigan-hybrid for work and a turtleneck maxi for outdoor winter festivities. DashDividers_1_500x100 Winter Maxi Dresses Maxi dresses aren’t just a summer staple — they’re arguably even better for winter (hello, full coverage). On casual days, opt for lounge-worthy styles, but when the vibes skew dressy, go for elevated details like off-the-shoulder necklines or flowy skirts. DashDividers_1_500x100 Velvet Dresses When it comes to winter fabrics, velvet is the undisputed favorite. It’s soft, tactile, and undeniably luxe — perfect for cocktail parties and winter events, especially in fitted midi or maxi silhouettes. For other seasonal occasions, like Valentine’s Day, we’ve also spotted darling minis with playful details like fluttery sleeves and lace collars.   DashDividers_1_500x100 Blazer Dresses With 2025 fashion trends like bold shoulders and soft suiting on the rise, it’s no wonder blazer dresses are having a moment. The suit alternative lets you bring the business vibes while showing a bit of leg (hey, now). Plus, with thicker fabrics like tweed and wool in the mix, you don’t have to sacrifice warmth. Just add fleece-lined tights and over-the-knee boots to fully winter-proof your look. DashDividers_1_500x100 Winter Wedding Guest Dresses If you’ve got weddings on the horizon and no look confirmed — we’ve got you. Go for sequins in rich jewel tones or classic black dresses with a twist (think bows and ruffles). For cocktail attire dress codes, try a mini or midi dress versatile enough to repurpose for other winter festivities. And if it’s black-tie, opt for a gown — bonus points if it’s in a festive color or dripping in sparkle. Like what you see?

    "description": "These days, I'm adamant about removing as much baggage from my life as possible - both metaphorically and literally. I've long been a fan of Lululemon's cult-favorite Belt Bag because of its compact yet functional design, but I've recently been coveting something even smaller for my day-to-day activities - like gym-trips, running errands, or basically any other scenario where I'd prefer to carry as little as possible. Lo and behold, Lululemon is actually the genius behind yet another viral accessory that pairs the brand's signature, sporty aesthetic with a lightweight and easy-to-carry bag design. Enter: the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet ($78). Chronically online folks (like myself) are likely all too familiar with this compact accessory, as it's become a mainstay on TikTok's \"For You\" page (and a go-to personal travel bag) for dozens of fashion editors and influencers alike. With all the hype surrounding this stylish pouch, I couldn't help but wonder if the accessory was really worth all of the internet craze, especially in light of the obsession surrounding its mid-size predecessor. Curious - and frankly looking for an excuse to spend my Lululemon gift card - I bought and tested the Dual Pouch Wristlet and sought to answer the many questions surrounding the accessory. Why is everyone so obsessed with Lululemon's Dual Pouch Wristlet? How much can you actually fit in the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet? Is there a better Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet dupe to shop online? I answer all of that, and more, ahead. How Was I Influenced to Buy the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet? Similar to most of my product buys these days, TikTok introduced and ultimately influenced me to purchase the Dual Pouch Wristlet. For months, I've seen users tout the accessory in videos and Instagram reels, all showing off the different ways that they use the pouch in their day-to-day lives. Some rave that it's their go-to gym bag because it holds their keys, Apple AirPods, and credit cards, all in one convenient place. Others swear it's the perfect bag alternative for travel because it eliminates the fear of pickpocketing thanks to its handheld design. @gabilemoine What should i put in the grey pouch?! Currently i havent put anything in there yet so maybe ill take that piece off for now but if theres something you think i should put in it let me know! #lululemon #lululemoncreator #lululemondualpouchwristlet @lululemon ♬ If It's Lovin That You Want (Sped Up) - Tazzy What I Like About the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet For me, the wristlet's customizable design is a huge part of its appeal. Both of the pouches are detachable from the product's main hook, meaning you can add or remove them as you like. I can also attach other items to the main hook, like my car keys or mace, so it's a great modular accessory for those who prefer something that they can easily make their own. The wristlet is also made from a 100 percent recycled nylon material that's sleek to the touch and relatively easy to keep clean; per the brand, you can simply spot clean it to remove any stains or dirt. Despite its compact design, the pouches can also hold quite a bit - including several credit cards, cash, a small lipstick, and anything else you'd like to keep handy. The actual wristlet is pretty open and stretchy, so you can comfortably wear it around your wrist without fear of skin irritation. And with a wide variety of tones and colorways (including new ones for fall), there are so many fun options to shop that feel totally unique to the traditional cardholder or wallet. What's Worth Noting My biggest qualm with this accessory is the lack of cardholder slots on the inside of the pouch. Prior to purchasing one of my own, I'd always assumed that the accessory would at least have one or two slots to keep items like credit cards or my driver's license secure, similar to the design of a traditional cardholder. While this doesn't affect the security of the piece - I still feel comfortable carrying around the accessory with items that I'd normally store in my wallet - I do think that having an extra interior slot or compartment would make all the difference in keeping items separated and thus easier to pull out whenever needed. Reviewers on Lululemon's site also noted that the light-colored variations tend to dirty faster than dark-colored ones, while others noted that the accessory's material frayed sooner than they expected. One reviewer wrote: \"Fabric frayed and hardware tarnished within first few months.\" I've had my pouch for a little less than a month and haven't noticed any significant wear and tear yet, but it's certainly something to be mindful of, given this product's higher price tag. Because several reviews cited issues with discoloration on shades like the white opal and flush pink colorway, I also chose to order mine in the classic black and traverse gray tones. If you want to avoid dirtying your bag too quickly, I recommend opting for one of the darker shades. Who Is the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet Best For? This wristlet is perfect for anyone who wants to cut back on their carrying capacity each day - without having to sacrifice on style in the process. The accessory has just enough space to hold the essentials, giving you the freedom to carry what you need and nothing more. Unlike traditional cardholders or clutches, it also has a durable design that'll hold up regardless of the weather or circumstance. It's the perfect embodiment of stylish functionality, and it's a great alternative for those who are tired of lugging around large accessories to the gym, while traveling, or even just running errands. Additional Details: Lululemon's Dual Pouch Wristlet is made from a durable, water-repellent fabric that's designed for on-the-go wear. Thanks to its hook design, the pouches are completely detachable, so you can customize the look and functionality of the accessory. It's available in different colorways on Lululemon's site, including black and traverse gray (my shades of choice). Where Is the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet Available to Shop? This accessory is available to shop exclusively at Lululemon.
