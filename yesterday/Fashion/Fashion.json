    "description": "Haiti's history is filled with vibrant cultural traditions and a spirit of resilience, marked by both periods of massive prosperity and profound struggle. The once-thriving Saint-Domingue was a key producer of sugar, coffee, textile production and much more.

Despite the challenges of political instability, natural disasters, and economic hardship that still persist, Haiti's creative pulse remains unshaken. Today, a new generation of Haitian creatives, including designers, makeup artists, and beauty entrepreneurs, are making their mark on the global stage—blending heritage with innovation. While many brands are taking the industry by storm, here are seven dynamic Haitian fashion and beauty brands that reflect the island's creative Caribbean flair and heritage, shaping its promising future built on its rich, complex past.Designed by Haitian-American fashion designer Dayanne Danier, Bien Abyé (which means \"Well Dressed\" in French Creole) offers a variety of handcrafted detailed accessories made by artisans in Haiti.

Sweat sets are an MVP for curling up on chilly flights. Bonus: You can break up a set and wear each piece separately, unlocking endless mix-and-match potential for those moments when you actually want to plan an outfit.If you’re ready to retire those ratty, holey sweats that have seen you through college and countless days under your duvet (no judgment — we’ve all got that pair), consider yourself covered.

From the subway to the office to after-work cocktails with your friends and beyond, these are the shoes you'll practically be living in daily, so it's important to shop for a pair that'll keep you feeling comfortable, supported, and chic. Ahead, we curated a list of this season's best and most comfortable work shoes for women, from slingback heels and black flats to business-casual shoes that can meet any office's dress-code requirements. Most importantly, they all have one thing in common: they'll become your go-to everyday pair. Depending on your job or daily journey, your comfort (and commute) requirements might have different needs. If you work in a more dressed-up environment with a walking commute, opt for classic, comfortable flats that you can wear with trousers. If your workplace is more casual and you drive, you can probably get away with wearing a pair of heels to spice things up. And, of course, we also made sure to include some versatile sneakers that pair well with all clothing items - and are even favorites of our own editors. Keep reading for our complete guide to the best women's work shoes. With styles from brands like Old Navy, Rothy's, and Everlane, there's something at every price point and markdown. Find your favorites and shop this season's best comfortable work shoes for standing all day.",
