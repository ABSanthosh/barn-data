    "description": "If you don’t want to look like a backing singer in an 80s music video, treat your eyeshadow with a light touchBack in the day I never understood eyeshadows. That was when people would use a million shades and textures and resemble extras on a dodgy 80s music video. These days, neutrals offer a really modern approach to eye (and lip) makeup. The low-key shades of taupes, browns and plums are perfect for anyone who shies away from complex eyeshadow looks and wants ease – I tend to use just fingers to be honest(with a cotton bud dipped in makeup remover on standby). And they are easy on the eye – yours and everyone else’s.1. Ilia The Necessary Eyeshadow Palette £40, iliabeauty.com 2. Blink Brow Bar x Priya Alhuwalia Eyebrow Pencil £22, bbb-london.com 3.

Short cuts kept close to a head’s profile, longer bobs swung in movement but dropped straight as a curtain at rest.Then in 1974, Sassoon’s young artistic director, Trevor Sorbie, saw how a model’s locks fell full and chunky as he pulled a brush through them, and, impromptu, cut that shape into her hair. This was 3D geometry. Voila, the Wedge, so striking that Vogue allotted it an unprecedented double-page spread. The cut was imitated worldwide, an emblem of the 70s like the platform soles and wide flares it balanced. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find the best things to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now.With our Halloween outfits and vampy makeup locked away for another year, our heads are now firmly turning towards the practical parts of our wardrobe that work for all weather eventualities. Think striped sweaters, blanket scarves, and heavy-duty boots. But staying warm doesn’t mean dressing like you’re about to climb a mountain.This season, plenty of It Girls are inspiring our freezing fashion looks for the winter months ahead. For those seeking a chic and refined look, the Olsen twins remain superior thanks to their arsenal of tailored coats, turtlenecks, and classic loafers. If you want a cozier option, Katie Holmes is an ideal reference point for slouchy cardigans, well-fitting jeans, and low-heeled leather boots. A more elevated approach would be Taylor Russell, our inspo for all-out cold-girl glamor with caramel-colored coats, faux fur scarves, and gold statement jewelry. Then there’s makeup, and it’s safe to say that we’re embracing all things warm and glossy. Hailey Bieber is leading the mood board with a pumpkin spice-inspired lip and glowy peach cheeks. And for hair makeovers, we can’t take our eyes off Rihanna’s curls, dyed a very seasonal shade of autumn leaf. To uncover all the new fashion and beauty launches that are giving us even more inspiration this November, click through the slideshow ahead…Disney x Lululemon Good vibes await courtesy of the new Disney x Lululemon collab, which finds your favorite comfy pieces from the activewear brand adorned with playful Mickey Mouse motifs.

For the collection, the Noah team dug into Barbour’s archives and reimagined popular styles from the ’80s. There’s the unisex Wool Bedale Jacket, which features a corduroy collar and is made with Casentino wool (a fuzzy fabric dating back to the 14th century); the Cotton Bedale, with the same silhouette but in a salt-washed cotton canvas; and the Border Jacket, a longer tweed style. “For this season’s Barbour collection, we stuck to the classic jacket shapes we’ve always loved from them,” Noah founder Brendon Babenzien said in a press release. “Barbour jackets, more than any other, have a timeless quality that allows them to get passed down from one generation to the next.” The Noah x Barbour collab is available to shop now.Shop now at Noah and BarbourNoah x Barbour Wool Teddy Bedale Jacket, $, available at NoahMerit Retrospect Extrait de ParfumMerit is well loved for its beautifully crafted makeup products and now the brand is expanding into the fragrance space with a vanilla and crisp pear perfume.

    "description": "Is there anything better than finding (read: falling in love with) a new handbag or trendy pair of sneakers, then discovering that the same product is also on sale at a fraction of its usual cost? Even after years of working as a shopping editor, I know firsthand that the \"stars aligned\" feeling of finding a dream style at the right price never really goes away - especially come Black Friday, when the season's most coveted wardrobe essentials are often marked down at their lowest prices of the year. While we're still a few weeks out from 2024's biggest shopping day, many retailers are getting in the holiday spirit early, with Black Friday sales that span the entire month of November and encompass a range of products. J.Crew is offering up to 50 percent off styles sitewide, including cozy sweaters and cardigans. Forever 21's early Black Friday sale is live, where shoppers can take 30 percent off trendy fashion staples - like faux-leather coats and evening bags. And even Amazon unveiled a bevy of new fashion markdowns on its bestselling clothing - including editor-loved bodysuits and Levi's jeans. Regardless of what you're in the market for, you can save big on it right now. Keep reading to shop our picks for the best early Black Friday fashion deals. Looking for something specific?
