There’s something undeniably energizing about spring fashion, a chance to get creative with how we dress and mix up our usual routines right as the weather gets nice. This season, there’s a whole spectrum of fresh ideas to dive into. From bolder-than-ever florals to the daring allure of chartreuse, spring is offering statement pieces that heighten your fashion senses and give you that much-needed sartorial jolt.First on our radar are pantaloons — yes, you heard right: The Victorian-era underpinnings are having a renaissance, stepping out from the shadows to swap in for your trusty wide-leg trousers and barrel jeans. Spring will also usher in a bolder reimagining of white lace that’s delightfully reminiscent of doilies and vintage drapery, but made for everyday wear. (The trick? Pairing these pieces with utilitarian items to dial down their primness.) Darling knit sets are primed to revamp your off-duty style, while vibrant chartreuse offers a vivid punch of energy. Then, there are tops decorated with rosettes and floral embroideries, channeling all the aught-era vibes with a sweetness that’s both feminine and fun.Keep reading as we break down the top 10 spring trends and how you can make them your own this season. Spring 2025 Trend: Pantaloons Pantaloons are making a comeback in a more modern form — think flowy and relaxed with sweet details— that offer a playful alternative to your usual trousers. Spring 2025 Trend: Textural Floral Tops   Whether in the form of rosettes to frothy embroideries, floral tops are the move for a soft, feminine touch to denim and trousers.  Spring 2025 Trend: Bolder Floral Dresses  Whether it’s an exaggerated silhouette or a near-dizzying (in a good way) motif, florals are taking on a more groundbreaking life this season while still feeling quintessentially spring. Spring 2025 Trend: Modern Lace  White lace can be far more dynamic than you thought. The reimagined pieces we’re seeing for spring pair well with your choice of structured, utilitarian, or casual everyday staples that balance the vintage charm. Spring 2025 Trend: Long Utility Shorts  We get it, Bermudas aren’t for everyone. But if you’ve been skeptical of the long shorts trend, try these utilitarian versions for a more casual look that feels far more fun than cargo pants. Spring 2025 Trend: Organza Airy and delicate, organza can skew formal, but designers have taken the stiffness out, making the material wearable in blouse, dress, and skirt form. While some pieces are more sheer than others, not every version is designed for full-on skin exposure. Spring 2025 Trend: Knit Sets  Spring’s new knit sets offer a jauntier look than your usual matching sweatsuits. Dress them up with a kitten heel and cute bag for a lunch date, or chill in a cozier set for a little couch-rotting. Spring 2025 Trend: Chartreuse Bold, vibrant, and just a bit left-of-center, this hue instantly adds instant freshness to your wardrobe, bringing a bright, lively energy to both casual and dressy ensembles.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lululemon-leggings-glow-up-collection-review?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": ".disclaimer{width:90%;margin-bottom:1rem}.disclaimer__lines{width:100%;margin:0 auto;border-bottom:1px solid #999;padding:0;max-width:150px}.disclaimer__copy{width:100%;max-width:355px;font-family:Brown Regular,sans-serif;font-size:.9rem;font-weight:300;line-height:1.3em;color:#333;padding:0 0 .4rem;margin:1rem auto;text-align:center} All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Lululemon’s products have a tendency to go viral soon after launch, so we expected the small but mighty Glow Up collection — with its high-waisted leggings, supportive tank tops, and workout onesie — to be a hit right out of the gate. What makes it so special and unique, within the rest of the brand’s assortment, you may ask? The “sleek and sculpting” Ultralu fabric, which is lesser-known but just as high-quality as the popular Nulu and Luon, for one. Also, the construction is intended to flex to your every move, able to take on high-energy and high-impact workouts, like HIIT and weight training.At the core of the collection is the Glow Up Super-High-Rise Tight, which comes in three lengths (23-inch, 25-inch, and 28-inch) and several colorways (both neutral and spring-ready). It boasts a bonded waistband to keep your core held in and supported, plus laser-cut hems for a clean look. (The brand suggests ordering your usual size as the Wunder Train Tights and to size up from what you wear in the Align Pants.) There’s also the Glow Up Medium Support Tank Top, designed for medium-impact training, with its cropped scoop neck and hidden shelf bra with size B/C cups, so you can forgo a sports bra and keep extra fabric (and distractions) to a minimum. Then, the 6-inch short Glow Up Onesie gives you the best of both worlds, combining the tank and leggings in one functional, fashionable style.To really see what the hype around the Lululemon Glow Up collection is all about, Refinery29 editors put the pieces to the test, seeing how they look and feel during various workouts. Ahead, read our honest thoughts, and decide if the viral styles are worth picking up for yourself, too. DashDividers_1_500x100 Glow Up Tank Top ($78) and Glow Up Super High-Rise Tight 25” ($118) “I’ve amassed quite the collection of Lululemon over the years, so I know the brand doesn’t often unveil an entirely new concept within its already-extensive offering. With Glow Up, Lululemon is combining fashion and function in a way I haven’t seen before; I tried the Glow Up Tank Top and Super-High Rise Tight, and both were giving ‘shapewear meets activewear’ in the best way possible.“I’ll start with the Tight. I absolutely love a high-rise legging — and the higher, the better. The fabric felt super smooth and dry to the touch, and offered a decent amount of smoothing compression at the waist without being too tight. I wore these on two recent flights, and was not only comfortable the whole time, but felt cute, too. (I’m 5’2”, and the 25-inch inseam hit right at my ankle.) I took my normal size 4, but I will say that, compared to my other Lululemon bottoms (especially the Aligns), the Glow Up fabric has a little less stretch. I would probably size up if you’re in between sizes. I really like these for running, hiking, and spin class, since they offer the support I need for high-impact activities.“Next, there was the Glow Up tank top, which looks similar to the fan-favorite Align Tank, but with some key modifications — namely, the front seam detail and a slightly higher neckline, which gives a bit more coverage. It has a built-in bra and runs true to size, if not a tad roomy. (I’m a 6 in sports bras, and the size 6 tank was a little large on me, but not baggy.) I own a couple Lululemon tanks, but this has become my go-to because it’s so comfortable and versatile. I’ve layered my black one under blazers, paired with denim, and, of course, with the matching leggings for a seamless look.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer DashDividers_1_500x100 Glow Up Tank Top ($78) and Glow Up Super High-Rise Tight 25” ($118) “As someone who’s slowly but surely growing my Lululemon arsenal, I was eager to try the new Glow Up collection and compare it to my (many) other activewear styles. I mixed-and-matched the 25-inch tight in Rainforest Green and tank top in Crater Blue for a fresh and cheerful workout look that I loved.“I will say that the customer reviews and the product page’s fit note got me nervous, so I ordered a size 14 instead of a 12 to account for the compression. I wish I had stuck to my true size, though, because the leggings weren’t as tight around my stomach, plus the hemlines were loose above my ankles (which I covered up with crew socks). They were still wearable, though, so I took them out for a power walk. “I really like just how high the waistline is, falling well above my belly button and preventing that digging look that compression leggings typically give me. It didn’t slip at all, and I never had to hike up the tights, either, which was a big plus. “I also enjoyed the tank top. I ordered it in a size 10 (my true size), which felt a bit roomy. I think, had I gone down one size, it wouldn’t look as baggy, and I’d feel more secure. Still, I really appreciated the medium-support bra cups, which allowed me to go sports bra-free and not feel insecure about it. The length was also great because, although it’s cropped, it lands below my belly button, which kept my stomach fully covered during every stretch and movement (a rarity!).” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion Writer DashDividers_1_500x100 Glow Up Tank Top ($78) and Glow Up Super High-Rise Tight 28” ($118) “I’ll admit, I’ve never owned a single piece of Lululemon activewear before. I was always curious, but found it out of my budget and wasn’t convinced that the brand catered to bodies like mine — a Black woman with curves and a booty. After being gifted the Glow Up Tank Top and Glow Up Super High-Rise Tights to celebrate the new body-hugging line, though, I can confidently say… I get the hype.“This collection seemed perfect for someone like me, since it’s meant to ‘sculpt with your every move’ and be worn anywhere. I was skeptical of the tights at first, as they looked impossibly small out of the package — there’s no way these will fit, I thought. But, to my surprise, the fabric had remarkable stretch, and the size 10 fit perfectly. “Designed to be body-hugging with move-enhancing support, the tights deliver exactly that: Once on, they fit snugly — secure but not restrictive, allowing full range of motion while subtly accentuating my curves. For someone who works out quite regularly and also teaches Pilates, a pair of leggings that I can move in all day is key.“The Glow Up tank was the real game-changer. I tried the size 8, and it provided my chest with an instant lift, as well as a snatched core, which surprisingly boosted my confidence. Unlike traditional sports bras, the built-in padding is supportive without the discomfort, and the removable cup inserts were a thoughtful touch. This is a piece you can seamlessly transition from workout to errands or even a coffee date, which I thoroughly enjoy.“Overall, the line delivers on its promise. It lifts, hugs, and supports, all while keeping moisture at bay. Although the sizing can be a bit tricky, I do think it provides a more personalized fit that’s sleek, stylish, and functional.” — Cortni Spearman, Social Director DashDividers_1_500x100 Glow Up Tank Top ($78) and Glow Up Super High-Rise Tight 28” ($118) “Don’t be intimidated by the fabric that, at first glance, seems like it provides little stretch. Despite getting them in my usual size 6, I drew in a breath as I pulled on the leggings for the first time… and found them easier to put on than expected. They instantly molded around my thighs, butt, and hips to hug my body without making me feel like a sausage in a casing. “While I find most workout tank tops to look unflattering — with the bottom of the tank top never quite landing where I want in relation to the pants and constantly rolling up — these pieces seem designed to go together, with the set creating a seamless effect to the point that it looks like you’re wearing a catsuit.“I have worn the set to lower-impact workouts like Pilates and Barre, but the Glow Up collection’s innovation shines brightest during HIIT and spin classes, with the leggings and tank tops staying in place through all the movements — on and off the bike saddle, squats, and burpees…. something that hasn’t been a given when I wore similar styles in the past.” — Irina Grechko, Global Fashion Director Shop the full Lululemon Glow Up collection.

    "title": "Is Lululemon's Viral Wristlet Better Than Its Famous Belt Bag? I Investigate",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/lululemon-dual-pouch-wristlet-review-49335470",
    "description": "These days, I'm adamant about removing as much baggage from my life as possible - both metaphorically and literally. I've long been a fan of Lululemon's cult-favorite Belt Bag because of its compact yet functional design, but I've recently been coveting something even smaller for my day-to-day activities - like gym-trips, running errands, or basically any other scenario where I'd prefer to carry as little as possible. Lo and behold, Lululemon is actually the genius behind yet another viral accessory that pairs the brand's signature, sporty aesthetic with a lightweight and easy-to-carry bag design. Enter: the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet ($78). Chronically online folks (like myself) are likely all too familiar with this compact accessory, as it's become a mainstay on TikTok's \"For You\" page (and a go-to personal travel bag) for dozens of fashion editors and influencers alike. With all the hype surrounding this stylish pouch, I couldn't help but wonder if the accessory was really worth all of the internet craze, especially in light of the obsession surrounding its mid-size predecessor. Curious - and frankly looking for an excuse to spend my Lululemon gift card - I bought and tested the Dual Pouch Wristlet and sought to answer the many questions surrounding the accessory. Why is everyone so obsessed with Lululemon's Dual Pouch Wristlet? How much can you actually fit in the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet? Is there a better Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet dupe to shop online? I answer all of that, and more, ahead. How Was I Influenced to Buy the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet? Similar to most of my product buys these days, TikTok introduced and ultimately influenced me to purchase the Dual Pouch Wristlet. For months, I've seen users tout the accessory in videos and Instagram reels, all showing off the different ways that they use the pouch in their day-to-day lives. Some rave that it's their go-to gym bag because it holds their keys, Apple AirPods, and credit cards, all in one convenient place. Others swear it's the perfect bag alternative for travel because it eliminates the fear of pickpocketing thanks to its handheld design. @gabilemoine What should i put in the grey pouch?! Currently i havent put anything in there yet so maybe ill take that piece off for now but if theres something you think i should put in it let me know! #lululemon #lululemoncreator #lululemondualpouchwristlet @lululemon ♬ If It's Lovin That You Want (Sped Up) - Tazzy What I Like About the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet For me, the wristlet's customizable design is a huge part of its appeal. Both of the pouches are detachable from the product's main hook, meaning you can add or remove them as you like. I can also attach other items to the main hook, like my car keys or mace, so it's a great modular accessory for those who prefer something that they can easily make their own. The wristlet is also made from a 100 percent recycled nylon material that's sleek to the touch and relatively easy to keep clean; per the brand, you can simply spot clean it to remove any stains or dirt. Despite its compact design, the pouches can also hold quite a bit - including several credit cards, cash, a small lipstick, and anything else you'd like to keep handy. The actual wristlet is pretty open and stretchy, so you can comfortably wear it around your wrist without fear of skin irritation. And with a wide variety of tones and colorways (including new ones for fall), there are so many fun options to shop that feel totally unique to the traditional cardholder or wallet. What's Worth Noting My biggest qualm with this accessory is the lack of cardholder slots on the inside of the pouch. Prior to purchasing one of my own, I'd always assumed that the accessory would at least have one or two slots to keep items like credit cards or my driver's license secure, similar to the design of a traditional cardholder. While this doesn't affect the security of the piece - I still feel comfortable carrying around the accessory with items that I'd normally store in my wallet - I do think that having an extra interior slot or compartment would make all the difference in keeping items separated and thus easier to pull out whenever needed. Reviewers on Lululemon's site also noted that the light-colored variations tend to dirty faster than dark-colored ones, while others noted that the accessory's material frayed sooner than they expected. One reviewer wrote: \"Fabric frayed and hardware tarnished within first few months.\" I've had my pouch for a little less than a month and haven't noticed any significant wear and tear yet, but it's certainly something to be mindful of, given this product's higher price tag. Because several reviews cited issues with discoloration on shades like the white opal and flush pink colorway, I also chose to order mine in the classic black and traverse gray tones. If you want to avoid dirtying your bag too quickly, I recommend opting for one of the darker shades. Who Is the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet Best For? This wristlet is perfect for anyone who wants to cut back on their carrying capacity each day - without having to sacrifice on style in the process. The accessory has just enough space to hold the essentials, giving you the freedom to carry what you need and nothing more. Unlike traditional cardholders or clutches, it also has a durable design that'll hold up regardless of the weather or circumstance. It's the perfect embodiment of stylish functionality, and it's a great alternative for those who are tired of lugging around large accessories to the gym, while traveling, or even just running errands. Additional Details: Lululemon's Dual Pouch Wristlet is made from a durable, water-repellent fabric that's designed for on-the-go wear. Thanks to its hook design, the pouches are completely detachable, so you can customize the look and functionality of the accessory. It's available in different colorways on Lululemon's site, including black and traverse gray (my shades of choice). Where Is the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet Available to Shop? This accessory is available to shop exclusively at Lululemon. Rating: Kyley Warren (she/her) is an award-winning writer and editor with more than four years of experience in the publishing space.

    "description": "Tiny handbags, be damned - this season is all about bold totes that are big enough to carry your entire life in. And as someone whose closet is chock-full of clutches, crossbody bags, and a number of other compact purse styles, I have very mixed feelings about the trend. But if there was ever a handbag that might sway my loyalties, I knew it would be the Cuyana Easy Tote ($268) - a standout piece from the luxury, ethical brand behind some of today's most polished fashion essentials. In all truth: I've had my eye on Cuyana's chic tote offerings for a while now (thank Meghan Markle for that!). So naturally, when I heard that Cuyana was planning to do a major makeover on its handbag and tote stock, my interest was immediately piqued. After all, this was the same brand beloved and religiously worn by celebrities like Jessica Alba and Angelina Jolie. Any collection revamp would have to rival some of the designer's cult-favorite styles like the (now defunct) Classic Structured Leather Tote, all while still staying true to Cuyana's reputation for timeless elegance. Fortunately, I was lucky enough to take Cuyana's popular bag style, the Easy Tote, for a test-drive before the product's debut. I'll admit: even as a fan of the brand, I was wary about whether the style could live up to the hype of the luxe designer's other, more staple bags. But so far, Cuyana's new Easy Tote has managed to do the impossible - make a tote believer out of even the most adamant mini-bag loyalist: me. The bag has been my greatest accessory companion over the past few weeks - and I have an inkling it will continue to be my go-to long after, too. Read on for my honest review of Cuyana's Easy Tote style. About the Cuyana Easy Tote The Cuyana Easy Tote is available to shop in two styles: a classic, horizontal Easy Tote and a Cuyana Tall Easy Tote ($268). The Easy Tote comes in eight different colors, including cappuccino (my bag of choice), caramel, black, and stone. The style is also available in a handful of fresh, seasonal colorways that include daffodil yellow, indigo, and ecru. This particular style is Leather Working Group (LWG)-certified, which affirms that the bag's leather is tanned in an environmentally responsible way. What I Like About the Cuyana Easy Tote Even upon first wear, you can tell the tote is built to last - a theme that's consistent with most all of Cuyana's product inventory. The bag is crafted from a lightweight, pebbled Italian leather that's designed to soften with each wear - making it a chic and comfortable style that's perfect for the long haul. The tote is also astonishingly lightweight - so much so that Cuyana has even marketed it as being the brand's \"lightest bag ever.\" As someone who has had some time to take the product for a spin, I can confirm: it really does live up to the airy hype. I'm notorious for carrying a lot of stuff with me wherever I go - whether it's to the gym, airport, office, and beyond, I always have plenty of my own daily essentials in tow. As a result, I've historically had to rely on bulky, heavy, and downright inconvenient totes to keep all of my handbag must haves organized. But thanks to Cuyana's Easy Tote, I get the space of a deep and chunky tote, all without any of the hassle or added weight. I suspect this is in part due to the tote's minimal design, which avoids cliché bag buffers like synthetic lining or bulky hardware. More than anything, I just love the timeless elegance of Cuyana's Easy Tote. The relaxed style boasts more of a squishy, breathable feel that's simple, stylish, and, best of all, subtle. Statement handbags and purses might be popular nowadays, but like most trends, it's difficult to predict whether they'll remain relevant in the next season. With the muted design of the Cuyana Easy Tote, I have no doubt that the bag will be a sophisticated and polished staple in my closet for years to come. What's Worth Noting The tote features a double-handbag design, which aims to create a more streamlined look, allowing users to easily switch between carrying the bag by hand or by shoulder. Initially, I was concerned that the shorter straps might look cluttered or even feel suffocating on my arm when I opted to hold the bag on my shoulder. Fortunately, the straps are flexible and can easily be pushed down into the tote when needed, all without causing damage or creases. While I wasn't immediately sold on the strap design, I've come to see the appeal - especially since it's like getting two bags in one. Another thing to note are the minimal storage compartments. The tote features a single, large hanging wall pocket on the interior, which is the perfect size for holding your phone, cardholder, or go-to lipstick or any other valuables you might need on hand. Personally, I don't mind that the bag has only one storage pocket - when it comes to totes, the simpler the design, the better. That being said, if you are someone who relies on having more structure or organized spaces in your bag, it's certainly something to be aware of and maybe it's worth purchasing a handbag organizer to go with it. Who Is the Cuyana Easy Tote Best For? Some people mark the beginning of a new chapter in their life with a fresh hairstyle or other grown-up investment. Others celebrate it by splurging on a new Cuyana handbag. I, like so many other fans of the luxury brand, prefer the latter - which is why I'd say this Cuyana tote is perfect for anyone looking for a timeless bag they can take anywhere and carry through any season. The deep style boasts plenty of interior space that's capable of holding everything from a school binder and work laptop to a reusable water bottle, wallet or cardholder, travel beauty bag, staple pair of sunnies, and so much more (even all at once!). Whether you're a grad student looking for a chic bag for school, a corporate worker in need of a practical tote to carry to and from the office, or just someone hoping to add a more relaxed style to your wardrobe, the Easy Tote encompasses the ideal, go-anywhere bag that will help you feel polished and supported in any season. Where Is This Cuyana Tote Available? The Cuyana Easy Tote is available to shop exclusively at the brand's website.
