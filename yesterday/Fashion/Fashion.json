If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. If you thought you’d reached peak après-ski inspo on your Pinterest feed, think again: Skims just launched a collaboration with winter outerwear giant The North Face — and it’s giving chic, cozy chalet vibes. “This marks Skims first-ever foray into the world of winter wear, and partnering with The North Face allowed us to leverage their expertise in this category,” said Kim Kardashian, Skims co-founder and chief creative officer, in a press release. “I’ve spent a lot of time on the slopes, so I was definitely inspired when we were developing this collection and I can’t wait to wear these pieces on my next trip.”  The ski-inspired collection includes a range of cropped puffer jackets, skin-tight jumpsuits, layering tops, gloves, headwear, and more. It blends The North Face’s iconic, functional designs with Skims’ body-hugging silhouettes and signature neutrals. The result? Mixed-and-matched layers or striking monochromatic looks, perfect for winter activities — from ice skating and skiing to holiday shopping and hot cocoa dates.Sizes range from XXS through 3X in most apparel styles, and mule sizes 5 through 11; prices start at $60 for a beanie and go up to $1,200 for a down one-piece.“At The North Face, we always put innovation and functionality first, the collaboration space is no exception. With Skims, we maintained best-in-class constructions and materials and this collaboration came about from a mutual admiration,” said David Whetstone, North Face director of collaborations and energy, in the press release.  Whether you’re stocking up on cozy season essentials or leaning into Pantone’s Mocha Mousse, this collection will have you bundled up and looking good all winter long.

    "description": "You can always rely on monochrome for an event look, but texture keeps it interestingWe’re a week into December and the party season is in full swing. If you’re struggling with the age old ‘what to wear’ conundrum, keep it simple. Stick with black and white and experiment with texture, it’s a versatile way to supercharge your outfit. Dolce and Gabbana’s AW24 collection is a master class in how to nail the look. Aim for contrasting textures to layer up: silk under wool, or velvet with lace adds a modern edge to the party look. Look for black-on-black embellishment for a timeless look you can wheel out every year. Reiss’s black sequin shirt (4) adds flair without being out-and-out showy, style with black trousers and loafers. Next’s subtle glitter tuxedo (8) is another affordable take on the look. For more adventurous dressers, one of the key runway trends was sheer – from full-on chest revealing transparency to more wearable gauzy shirts, like Allsaints lace one (£119) and River Island’s white lace (£46, main image above).If embellishment is too seasonal look for interesting detailing, like Represent’s zip-up jacket (2) that will look sharp long after the last champagne cork has popped on NYE . Ditto Zara’s tailored separates and Daily Paper’s chess board patterned pieces, style with a gauzy shirt for a night out, but swap in a sweater for spring. For more formal events, velvet blazers always look super chic over a fine-gauge black rollneck. Continue reading...",
