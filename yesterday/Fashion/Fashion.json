    "description": "Nightdresses are set to follow pyjamas out of the bedroom as daywear, with sales up on the UK high streetIn the first episode of Lena Dunham’s new Netflix sitcom Too Much, viewers might be taken with cameos from Dunham, Jessica Alba and the model Emily Ratajkowski, or the burgeoning romance between Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe. But – as far as fashion is concerned – it’s nighties that have a starring role.Early in the episode, Stalter wears a short frilled red nightie, with her dog in a matching design. Later, she wears a white frilled floor-length design, and it’s clear the item is something of a signature. If it’s a cute quirk for a character, it’s also in line with wider trends.

    "description": "Time to sign out of your Work Bag, sling a straw basket bag over your shoulder and feel your pulse slow downIs there any point putting an out of office on your emails when you go on holiday any more? “I won’t have access to emails.” Yeah, right. Sorry, you aren’t fooling anyone: no one goes on holiday without their phone in 2025. Your office know perfectly well that if you don’t answer emails, they can still reach you by text or direct message. Even, theoretically, by actually calling you, although obviously that won’t happen because that’s another thing that no one does in 2025. Tweak your out of office message as much as you like – you might as well stick your fingers in your ears.No, the best way to set your brain to holiday mode is by signing out of your Work Bag. Swapping the bag you take on your daily commute for a free-and-easy alternative is more effective as a psychological gear change than logging out of your emails. In day-to-day life, I change handbags as rarely as possible, the potential for leaving keys in an inside pocket and getting locked out being just too real. But when you get home after work and you aren’t going back for a week or two, there is something very pleasing about marking that moment by throwing away leaky pens, marvelling at how you managed to accumulate 14 hairbands, and then shaking the bag over the bin and feeling disproportionately thrilled when a pound coin falls out. Stashing the bag – with your office pass inside – is very out of sight and out of mind. Continue reading...",

    "description": "If your summer plans include beach days, hiking, music festivals, dancing, and dining al fresco, then H\u0026M’s new collaboration launching July 17 needs to be on your radar — and in your shopping cart ASAP. British model, content creator, and long-time friend of the retailer Mia Regan has co-designed her “dream summer wardrobe,” she tells Refinery29. And it’s the versatile, travel-ready capsule of our dreams, too.While Regan’s Instagram is full of editorials and fashion events, it also highlights her travel adventures and film photography. Often spotted in staple headscarves and hiking shoes on her escapades, Regan’s lifestyle and style are reflected in the collection. As she explains, “I wanted to design it so you could wear it to a festival or on a hike, or out to dinner or drinks with your girls.”From utilitarian capris, which came easily to her, to breezy pieces like a sarong detailed with her hand-drawn illustrations, Regan was hands-on throughout, submitting sketches and collaborating with the Stockholm team. “I take my film camera everywhere,” she says. “One of the illustrations is actually from a picture I took on an H\u0026M trip in Portugal — it’s me and my friend lying down, and I drew that.” The 17-piece capsule also includes maxi dresses, matching sets, swimwear, and accessories — including a personal favorite, the cord belt — all in earthy palettes, with asymmetric details, silver hardware, and cheerful prints that transition effortlessly from day to night.In a press release, Regan said she drew inspiration from “travels to bohemian Ibiza, dancing at British festivals, retro movies, and sun-soaked European holidays with friends.” She also told Refinery29 she designed with her friends and family in mind: “Seeing them wear, enjoy, and style the pieces in their own way is really lovely.” H\u0026M creative advisor and head of womenswear design Ann-Sofie Johansson added, “Mia’s style is eclectic — she has a great eye for details and a very instinctive way of mixing different elements. It was inspiring to watch this good friend of the brand explore her creativity throughout the design process.”So whether you’re escaping on a European vacation or staying local, Mia Regan’s H\u0026M collaboration is here to dress you for every summer adventure.

    "description": "If there's any celebrity you can count on to nail any and every aesthetic, trend, or fad, it's Lady Gaga. The Grammy-winning singer is completely unabashed when it comes to taking risks in her artistry as a whole, but her style, perhaps most of all, knows no bounds. Of course, we all remember her iconic outfit for the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards - a dress, hat, boots, and purse made entirely out of raw beef, designed by Franc Fernandez. The look garnered so much attention that it was listed by Time as the top fashion statement of that year (and it has its own Wikipedia page!). Fast-forward to present day, and the artist born Stefani Germanotta is still crafting her own lane of style as she promotes her latest album, \"Mayhem,\" which she'll be taking on the road starting in July. Apart from the otherworldly visuals, surrealist dance routines, and captivating vocals, you can expect Lady Gaga's tour outfits to deliver just as much drama for us to be inspired by for years to come. In true Gaga fashion, she's created mind-blowing visuals to accompany the album's most major hits, like \"Abracadabra.\" In the video, we see the singer's limitless sartorial abilities even more, namely a custom Samuel Lewis x Suman Gurung x Ilona lace ensemble accompanied by a stiffened, dramatic collar and tiered train - giving us firsthand inspiration for the tour. In case Elizabethan-inspired clothing isn't exactly your style, you can take notes from Gaga's previous eras while planning your concert look. Think exaggerated denim and embellished accessories inspired by her \"Marry the Night\" video, or loud, leopard looks like the jumpsuit she wore in her and Beyoncé's boundary-pushing anthem \"Telephone.\" And if you can't make a strict decision on which Gaga-approved aesthetic to channel, we've done the legwork and rounded up the best concert outfit ideas for you to shop. From gaudy jewelry to dramatic denim from favorites like Nordstrom and Revolve, these are the best Lady Gaga-inspired fashion finds to get for The \"Mayhem\" Ball.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/love-island-usa-best-swimsuits-49451697",
    "description": "Season seven of \"Love Island USA\" was equal parts entertaining, controversial, and anxiety-inducing. From the unforgettable spiral of Huda Mustafa and Jeremiah Brown (that lasted all of one week early on in the season), to the unexpected, yet necessary reunion of Olandria Carthen and Nic Vansteenberghe. Through the season's many cringe moments and last night's monumental win for sensitive gangster Amaya Espinal and Bryan Arenales, there were many noteworthy elements that inspired our shopping habits, including the outfits. From the minidresses and crochet button-downs that informed fire pit chats to Ariana Madix's mastery at cutouts, cast members made dressing in Fiji look too easy. And of course, the swimwear was far from lacking. Notable moments include Carthen's affinity for crochet coverups and cowboy hats (a combination that's so \"Cowboy Carter\"-coded), Mustafa's massive thongkini collection, and Megan Thee Stallion's \"Hot Girl Summer\" gold bikini, also marking its debut on the show. Whether islanders were strutting casually through the villa enjoying downtime with their partners or going on impromptu dates to another part of the island, each bikini look left us obsessed. Ahead, check out the best \"Love Island USA\" swimsuits from season seven - and shop exact and similar pieces to inspire your next vacation's wardrobe.",
