Our fashion guru reveals how you can shake up your wardrobe for the new season• The best Chanel-style jackets to rival the real thingIn the winter months, I crave the comfort of repetition. I want to make a vat of soup to keep in the fridge and have a bowl for lunch every day. I long to discover a TV drama that I have somehow missed and have seasons to catch up on so that I can watch an episode every night. Hibernation, essentially.Then, after months of that, the clocks go forward and – like clockwork – I get an itch for novelty. Yesterday I went to refresh the water in a vase of flowers on the mantelpiece; 15 minutes later all the stems were piled up around me on the floor and I was curating a whole new arrangement.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/Wedding-Guest-Dresses-43766105",
    "description": "It's no secret that getting a gorgeous letter-pressed wedding invitation in the mail brings immediate excitement. Your eyes quickly scan the location and before you know it, you're on Pinterest gathering a mood board or scrolling through Farfetch to find that standout ensemble that'll earn you the title of best-dressed for the night. As exhilarating as the search for the perfect wedding guest dress can be, it can easily get stressful when there's a dress code involved. We have nothing against them, but a dress code has the power to make your shopping escapade a breeze or a headache - especially when they're unofficial. Wedding attire has become unconventional in recent years, but apparently, stern rules still apply if you're Sydney Sweeney. The \"Anyone But You\" star recently caused a stir for wearing a blue corset dress (that's close to white) to co-star Glen Powell's sister's wedding. The viral outfit has left the internet divided on what's acceptable wedding attire versus what isn't. But let's be real, you can wear anything you want to a wedding. We've seen everything from TikTok trends done right like the stomach pudge dress to guests dressed in all-white that's totally cosigned by the bride herself (just like Solange Knowles's iconic ceremony). Surely, a blue dress is more than acceptable, too. Whether you're attending an upcoming wine-country wedding that's sure to be warm or an indoor ceremony with a cocktail party dress code (that's not super strict), we found a handful of wedding guest dresses that are bound to catch your eye. From florals for spring to formal pieces that are equal parts boundary-pushing and stylish, we've gathered our top picks that you'll want to wear on repeat. Now all that's left is to pick out something from the registry and get it wrapped in time - easy peasy. Shop our top wedding guest dresses ahead.",

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Calling all sneakerheads. We’ve found a one-stop shop for all your athleisure needs: JD Sports. JD Sports sells must-have activewear and loungewear as well as the latest sneaker launches. But its JD Global Access collection is its biggest highlight. It features on-trend styles in exclusive colorways that no other retailers sell, meaning you can really stand out from the crowd in your limited-edition kicks.Ahead, we scoured the retailer’s new arrivals and Global Access offerings to find which spring and summer sneaker trends you can test out while shopping all in one place. Whether you’re into chunky hiking shoes or slim sporty styles, and whether you’re drawn to neutrals or vibrant hues, JD Sports has a variety of sneakers ready to be carted up and strutted around this season.   DashDividers_1_500x100 Festival-Ready Sneakers When we think of the festival shoes we should actually wear during long, steamy (and sometimes muddy) days, we’re all about a chunky dad sneaker or hiking shoe. They’re supportive, durable no matter the weather or terrain, and are ideal for running between stages. Look to JD Sports for many neutral options that’ll match the scenery, or choose a darker style that’ll hide any inevitable dirt and grass stains.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Retro Sporty Sneakers Slim sporty sneakers aren’t going anywhere, so it’s definitely worth hopping on this retro bandwagon. Whether you’re into a soccer-cleat inspired shoe that’s minimalist in design or a retro basketball-inspired high tops, you can take on the sporty trend in a variety of ways. Choose a neutral color-combo for everyday wear or go bold with a vibrant color for a statement that’ll stop people in their tracks.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Mocha Mousse Sneakers After Mocha Mousse was declared the 2025 Pantone color of the year, we’ve been spotting browns everywhere, and especially on sneakers. Stick to one shade for a clean look or choose a style with several shades and dimension for a stylish smorgasbord of walnut, caramel, and chocolate tones.   DashDividers_1_500x100 Candy-Colored Sneakers If you’re more inclined to be playful with your sneakers, consider vibrant uppers or pops of color that‘ll get you into the spring and summer spirit. From extreme Lemonhead yellows and watermelon Sour Patch greens to more subtle bubblegum pinks and cotton-candy blues, these colorways and combos are as sweet as they are surprising (and they also all happen to be trending this season).   Shop all JD Sports.
