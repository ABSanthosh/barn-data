    "description": "Need a classic swimsuit for less than £40? A hat that’s easy to pack? Or the perfect beach-to-bar T-shirt? Make this summer a breeze with our fashion experts’ top tipsThere is a very specific panic around summer dressing – all that flesh on show, for starters. So it always seems strange just how little thought we give to it. Obviously you care what you look like, but think how much time and energy you put into finding the perfect winter coat, or boots to see you through the post-Christmas doldrums. Some of you probably save up, or at least try on a few different styles to see what you like. Compare that to choosing a swimsuit or shorts. How often do you buy something the day before you go on holiday, or even at the airport? You’ll probably spend more time in your coat and boots but still, it’s a bit daft panic-buying some sandals before finding out, mid-hike, that the back strap rubs your heel and they slip off the moment your feet get sweaty.The truth is that aside from the fact that people equate wearing fewer clothes with being cooler – not true! – it’s very hard to know what to wear when the sun comes out. So we are here to help. How about a tank that needs no bra, a swimsuit that doubles as a top, and a quick-dry, no-towel towel? Or a T-shirt for the guys that’s cocktail-approved – and a hat the kids will actually wear? Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/07/11919793/sydeon-new-balance-cosplay-interview?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "If you’ve ever peeped Sydeon’s Instagram feed, you know her love for New Balance isn’t just for show. So it tracks that the Twitch streamer and content creator has officially joined the brand as its second gaming ambassador — and she’s already putting in the work. “I have put all of my friends onto this shoe. It’s the 1906L. It’s like a sneaker loafer,” the creator and Twitch streamer tells me. “It was one of the first things that I asked for when [New Balance and I] started talking about our partnership. I was like, ‘Look, the shoe is sold out everywhere. I can’t find it in any of the colorways. If you happen to have an extra one, like please.’” Her excitement is so convincing that mid-answer I find myself (somewhat unprofessionally) Googling this mythical mashup of footwear. Yes, it is cool. And now I want a pair, I tell her.  Consider me influenced. Authentic brand–creator partnerships are like a good outfit: effortless, memorable, and sells itself. For Sydeon, although she’s made a name for herself streaming gameplay on Twitch, her content has always reflected her broader interests in fashion and lifestyle, whether she’s cosplaying as Rogue from X-Men, giving a wig tutorial, or travel vlogging foodie adventures overseas. Which makes it that much easier for a brand like New Balance to sign on. “New Balance has this really unique outlook on their brand and on culture and just craftsmanship and individualism and all those things,” Sydeon says, “and I think that kind of lined up with me as a streamer as well.” Ahead, Sydeon shares her thoughts on personal style, makes the case that cosplay is fashion, and offers tips on how to successfully partner with brands. Refinery29: How would you describe your personal style and how does it align with New Balance? I like to mix a lot of different things. I really love both feminine and masculine pieces together so I’ll wear a really cute frilly top and then baggy pants and sneakers. I also really just go based off of mood. Sometimes I want a sort of athleisure look and sometimes I want to be really feminine and have lots of floral pieces. So it’s kind of all over the place, like, I would say, I am as a content creator. New Balance is just all about being authentic, being yourself, being an individual, and they have so many different pieces that fit that mold. You have something like a sneaker loafer and then you have your everyday walking shoe, and then you also have really functional things for hiking or for basketball or whatever it is. New Balance has something for everyone and I like to be a little bit of everything in my personal style. More and more brands are getting into the world of gaming. Where do you see that intersection of fashion and gaming going?  I think the intersection of fashion and gaming is really at the beginning of its peak. There are so many gamers and content creators who have such a love for fashion and a lot of gamers and content creators are becoming more mainstream. You see people who have loved games and have maybe been quiet about them in the past because it wasn’t as cool, and you find out now that everybody has loved games as much as they have loved fashion and sports and stuff. It feels like it’s become one of the mainstream things now, which is really exciting because you get opportunities like this with New Balance. I feel like some people who aren’t in the world of anime or cosplay or gaming see cosplay as more costume than fashion or art. To those haters or skeptics, how would you defend cosplay as fashion?  I think cosplay is self-expression in a very niche form. Oftentimes people look at cosplay and they’re like, “Oh, you’re just dressing up in costumes, but it’s not Halloween.” Yada yada. Cosplay for me and for a lot of other people is craftsmanship. It is sitting down for hours and working on something, building something from hand, from scratch, altering things and I think a lot of people kind of forego the idea cuz it feels like silly costumes, but it takes a lot of the same craftsmanship as fashion does. Some of my favorite cosplayers do cosplay in a way that really meshes well with fashion because they’ll take their character and then [remake it]. What if this was casual? What if they were just wearing something on the street? What would they look like?  Who are some of your favorite cosplayers?  One of my favorites since the dawn of time is Snitchery and she’s one of my favorite people to watch change throughout the industry. I’ve been following her probably since like 2018 or something like that and I remember she used to do just portrait cosplay and now I’m seeing her at every world premiere for every movie and she always comes dressed according to the movie but in a fashion sense. Method dressing! Yeah! Then of course Stella Chu is another cosplayer I love. She’s in LA and she’s worked with me before on cosplay. She’s really sweet and she’s super talented. Like her warehouse is just full of 3D printers and stuff everywhere. I’d love to get your two cents as someone who has built a career off of creating and streaming. Once you’ve built that community, how do you branch out from your usual lane with a new partnership or a new project that’s maybe outside of how your audience usually knows you? I think it’s really important to explore a lot of different avenues and I think that I’m lucky that my personality just has always allowed me to do that. I think it’s a little bit scary when it feels like, ‘Oh, my audience is so used to me sitting down and playing the same game every day for 12 hours. What are they going to think when they find out that I’ve partnered with a brand like New Balance?’ Where it’s like, ‘Oh, I didn’t know you were interested in that kind of thing.’ Except my community definitely knows. I talk about fashion and sneakers and stuff like that all the time. But maybe if a community wasn’t [aware], I think it’s just fun to challenge yourself and challenge the people around you, your community, and I think you’d be really surprised how many people are interested in the same things as you. Because people are multi-faceted. They might enjoy gaming, but they probably enjoy so many other things and I think it’s always worth taking the risk. And even if it doesn’t work out, you tried something that was authentic to you and that’s what matters the most. What are some tips you have for creators who are looking to work more with brands? For a creator who’s looking to work more with brands, obviously being brand-friendly is one of those pretty important things. I think if that falls in line with who you are as a creator, then it’s great to be on that route. I think that when you are yourself and your genuine interests are out there, brands will take notice. I’m not a brand, but if I were, I would probably be really excited if I saw someone who was genuinely excited about what I already do, you know?

    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography | Marisa Petrarca My earliest memories of Loft date back to when it was still called Ann Taylor Loft, when I'd tag along with my mom to help her pick out work outfits. It's been a minute since I've stepped foot in a store, but recently, my TikTok algorithm (which knows me frighteningly well) served up a few trending fashion picks from the brand's website. And honestly? Loft is delivering. The pieces feel exactly like the aesthetic I'm reaching for these days: elevated but effortless, polished yet comfortable. Cue me immediately adding the exact items they fed me to my cart: the Deco Mini Wrap Skirt ($35, originally $70) and the Ribbed Square Neck Sweater Tank Top ($27, originally $55). About the Loft Deco Mini Wrap Skirt The Loft Deco Mini Wrap Skirt is available in both regular and petite sizes. You can find it in stores and online. It's made of 100 percent lyocell and is machine washable. It measures 17.5 inches in length and features a straight, relaxed shift fit. What I Like About the Loft Deco Mini Wrap Skirt What I like most about the Loft Deco Mini Wrap Skirt is how it blends two trends I keep seeing on Pinterest: bandana prints and sarong-style silhouettes. The fit feels polished yet playful, and with the right accessories, I can wear it just as easily for daytime plans as I can for a night out. It's also incredibly easy to style. Admittedly, I'm not the most adventurous dresser, so this skirt speaks to my minimalist heart - it looks chic with anything black and white (though by all means, go bold if that's your thing). I paired it with a classic Loft tank I'll be wearing on repeat year-round, the Staud handbag I wear constantly, and a pair of strappy black heels. Lastly (and at the risk of sounding a little obsessed), I love that this skirt isn't an online exclusive. So many pieces sell out fast online and are nearly impossible to track down. Thankfully, it's also available in stores, and I noticed that several Minnesota locations near me still had it in stock. (Can't promise the same for you, but I'm hopeful!) Image Source: PS Photography | Marisa Petrarca What to Consider About the Loft Deco Mini Wrap Skirt Something to keep in mind about the Loft Deco Mini Wrap Skirt is that it's made of 100 percent lyocell, which the brand lists as machine washable in the product details. While that's true, I did a little digging and found that the best way to keep it looking its best long-term is to wash it on a delicate cycle in cold water with a mild detergent, then air dry. I'm admittedly reaching for cons here, but if you're planning to keep this piece in regular rotation, it's worth noting. Where Is the Loft Deco Mini Wrap Skirt Available? No shocker here: the Deco Mini Wrap Skirt is a Loft exclusive, available both in stores and online.

    "title": "Amaya Espinal's Muumuu Is More Than Just a Viral \"Love Island USA\" Moment",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/amaya-espinal-muumuu-dress-love-island-usa-49452354",
    "description": "It's no secret that \"Love Island USA\" is impacting current culture as we know it. While it's far from the first love-centered reality show that we've seen, its popularity is especially referential. The show's foundational concept is unusual alone - being secluded on an island away from the outside world to find the love you've been looking for all your life. Islanders also played a significant role in season seven's massive impact, including Olandria Carthen and Nicolas Vansteenberghe's kiss that caused a massive crash-out at \"Love Island\" watch parties. Another highlight from the show that's still on our minds? Amaya Espinal (aka our sensitive gangster) wearing a muumuu in episode 28. While the New Yorker's bubbly personality and witty candor have given us plenty of meme-worthy moments to reflect on, her muumuu is far from just another piece of clothing that's passed the TikTok viral test. In an interview with the Today show, Espinal revealed that she only had a day to prepare for the show before being flown to Fiji, so she threw a bunch of clothing in a suitcase - including the muumuu she got during a trip to Portugal. \"Bringing that piece back to the villa reminded me of my travels and reminded me of the good days whenever I was having a bad one,\" she says. \"It was more than a dress for sure - it really made me feel grounded.\" @dontask724 just a girl and her moo moo against the world #amaya #amayaloveisland #amayapapaya #loveislandusa #loveisland #usa #fyp #viral ♬ original sound - 𓇼 Apart from the sentimental value it holds for Espinal, the muumuu bears cultural significance that's particularly noteworthy. The comfortable piece can be traced back to the early 19th century, when Christian missionaries in Hawaii influenced native women to wear the silhouette to further cultivate modesty. Hawaiian women adapted a more casual, sleeveless version - the \"holokū\" - for everyday wear, before it was renamed the muumuu. Fast forward to present day, the dress style is still acceptable in Western culture, and often a go-to purchase for vacations, Hawaiian-themed parties like luaus, and more. And of course, celebrities have proudly embraced the muumuu - most recently, Kris Jenner, Oprah Winfrey, and Gayle King were seen wearing them on a Mallorca getaway. Espinal wearing her own speaks to the diversity we need to see more of on reality shows, and is a surefire way to exhibit the fact that modesty is still attractive. During the scene in which she wore it, her partner, Bryan Arenales, complimented her look (despite her labeling it as a \"grandma dress\"). His support proves that you don't always need to show skin to be deemed attractive or desired - especially in the eyes of your romantic partner. While her exact dress isn't available to shop, we found similar picks that evoke the same level of style and confidence: Unique Kaftans Floral Print Long Tunic Dress ($3, originally $10), JaipurCraftandArt Cotton Kaftan ($27, originally $75), and H\u0026M Oversized Kaftan Dress ($75).
