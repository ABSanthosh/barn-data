If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Winter jackets are practical, but the best ones aren’t a supporting act — they’re the main character, serving as the outfit. That’s why we’re all about layering up in outerwear that delivers warmth and wow factor. Whether you’re leaning into the coziness of a sherpa coat or the sporty edge of a puffer, the right winter topper can transform even the simplest look into a moment. This season, the top coat is getting a modern twist with ladylike details and cape silhouettes, while wintry leather and suede jackets hold their ground (though not without fresh updates, from vibrant colors to bold faux-fur trims). Bombers are vying for the spotlight, too, feeling particularly on-point in warmer winter climates. And if you’re in need of a warm layer to drape over your winter wedding guest attire? Look no further than the faux-fur coats topping our edit (Topshop’s, Gap’s, and Abercrombie’s are incredible). As far as specific items go, fan favorites like the Aritzia slouch coat, the North Face puffer, and the teddy-like UGG coat prove that staying warm doesn’t mean compromising on style. Whether you’re bundling up, keeping it tailored, or planning outcoats to pair with your coziest oversized scarf, our picks ahead make braving the cold downright fun. DashDividers_1_500x100 Faux-Fur Coats Nothing says winter glamour like a faux-fur coat. From Topshop’s hip-grazing silhouette to Gap’s best-selling knee-length style, these jackets balance boldness with cozy comfort. They’re perfect for pairing with denim or a sweater dress to dress up the casual winter staples. DashDividers_1_500x100 Suede Jackets Suede jackets are stepping it up with fun, vibrant shades this winter, like Free People’s rust red rendition and Urban Outfitters’ cobalt blue style. A classic refreshed for those who like their layers heavyweight and punched up with a little more personality. DashDividers_1_500x100 Puffer Jackets The puffer jacket is a winter essential that’s equal parts cozy and cool. From North Face’s iconic 1996 Retro Nuptse to Coach’s cute (and reversible!) cropped design, these go with everything, from comfy travel pants to date-night looks (or sweats when you’re keeping it lounge-y for weekend errands). Fully lean into the vibe with coordinating puffer boots.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Leather Coats Leather coats are a closet mainstay for a reason: They do the most (in a good way). Plush-lined styles (like Asos Curve’s long silhouette lined with shearling) bring serious warmth for frigid days, while lightweight options (like BDG’s fur-trimmed aviator) are just the thing for milder temps. DashDividers_1_500x100 Sherpa Coats Sherpa coats bring a plush, textural twist to cold-weather layering. From statement designs like Damson Madder’s checked and bow-adorned jacket to timeless teddy silhouettes like UGG’s Gertrude and J.Crew’s winter-white peacoat, they’re ideal for adding warmth and a fun touch to your winter wardrobe.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Ladylike Wool Coats Curved lines, sharp collars, and sleek details give classic wool coats a fresh spin this season. Look at Reformation’s bow-tied jacket or Madewell’s bold red design — they’re ladylike, minimal, and anything but boring (especially if you go bold by styling yours alongside the dress-over pants trend).  DashDividers_1_500x100 Bomber Jackets Bomber jackets are getting a sport-luxe makeover with padded and quilted designs (perfect for brisk chills), slouchy faux leather (bonus points for trendy colors like burgundy), and even reversible options (who doesn’t love a two-fer?). Style them over clingy knits with jeans and a statement belt for an “I tried, but not too hard” nonchalance. DashDividers_1_500x100 Cape Coats Cape coats are one of those runway trends that are actually wearable IRL. From Dôen’s plaid take to Banana Republic’s bright red number (hitting two trends at once), these styles deliver drama with a polished sensibility. Like what you see?

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Beanies? Gloves? Sure, they’re wardrobe essentials when the wind chill intensifies, and your coffee cools down faster than you can sip it. But on the winter fashion scale, they’re pretty basic. Scarves, on the other hand, are anything but. These winter accessories have range and can transform an outfit with minimal effort. From patterned and colorful designs to luxe cashmere and wool fabrications and even hooded silhouettes, they’re the MVPs of cold-weather dressing. But if there’s one type that consistently steals the spotlight (and keeps us the coziest), it’s the oversized scarf — the stylishly and borderline excessive piece that turns bundling up into an art form. This season, brands are doubling down on the trend, offering everything from ultra-plush styles made from faux fur and teddy-like shearling to fuzzy brushed alpaca and vibrant, ribbed silhouettes that rival your favorite throw. So, instead of splurging on yet another pair of forgettable gloves or a one-size-fits-all beanie, opt for an oversized scarf — it’s a budget-friendly way to embrace the scarf coat trend without committing to (or investing in) the full look. Keep scrolling to shop 24 of the season’s best options for every style and sensibility — you’ll be covered, both literally and sartorially. Oversized Scarves: Brushed A brushed scarf is all about adding a touchable, cozy texture to your look. Offered in mainstay neutrals and playful colors or prints, these scarves bring ultimate warmth with a classic sensibility. Oversized Scarves: Cashmere Soft, oversized, and luxe, cashmere scarves are a timeless winter must-have. Whether you go for a neutral, graphic whipstich detailing, or a pastel hue, these babies bring coziness and polish to any cold-weather outfit. Oversized Scarves: Fleece-y Feels Fleece scarves are the ultimate in cuddle-worthy, from timeless wraps to trendy hooded designs à la Free People’s rust-red version. They bring a plush, modern touch while delivering mega warmth. Oversized Scarves: Fringe We love a bit of drama — when it comes to fashion, at least. Long, exaggerated tassels are the perfect way to refresh this classic winter accessory, adding movement and a bold finish to any winter look. Oversized Scarves: Faux Fur Shearling, faux fur, and shaggy textures bring a whole new dimension of softness. These scarves are a tactile treat, begging to be touched. Layer them over sleek silhouettes for a refined contrast, or lean fully into the snug vibes with matching textured pieces as seen above. Oversized Scarves: Ribbed Ribbed scarves bring a chunky feel and add personality to your winter lineup. From pastel wool to bold cashmere blends, these styles add texture while feeling like your coziest blanket.  Like what you see?

You can dress it up or down, and whether you're wearing it for a date or throwing it on for a quick grocery store run, there's nothing like a well-worn leather jacket that is perfectly you. However, finding a high-quality leather jacket at a price that won't break the bank is no easy feat.
