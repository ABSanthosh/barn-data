    "description": "No longer the preserve of newborns, the bonnet is having its own catwalk moment this season. But is their cosy revival driven purely by practicality, or something deeper?Hej! Greetings from Copenhagen. I am in the Danish capital for fashion week, now regularly referred to as the “fifth fashion week” after New York, London, Milan and Paris – such is its influence in the industry and beyond.While some of the catwalk trends have divided opinion (not everyone is down for a ballet flat/sneaker hybrid) on the streets, one item gets a firm yes: the bonnet. Yes, the head covering typically associated with newborns has been seen on everyone from the street-style set outside shows to the Danes queueing at bakeries for their morning buns. It’s not just in Denmark, either. The accessory is thriving and bumping beanies off the headgear charts in London and New York. One TikTok user summed it up: “Brat summer, bonnet winter”.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Toss the totes, shelve the shoulder bags, and retire that overstuffed clutch — at least for now. It’s time to make a case for the crossbody bag. Arguably the most low-maintenance member of the purse family, it’s hands-free, layers effortlessly over any outfit, and still looks undeniably cool. And not to sound like your mom, but it’s also ridiculously practical. Look, ma, no hands! What makes the crossbody truly unbeatable, though, is its shape-shifting versatility. From sleek crescent slings to puffy, padded styles built for winter, these bags adapt to your every need. Whether you’re drawn to structured flap bags, multitasking convertible designs, or bucket bags that are making a strong return to the spotlight, there’s a crossbody for every vibe (work, going out, winter weddings, you name it). Ahead, 30 styles we’re ready to throw over our bodies immediately. Crescent Slings Sleek and shaped to hug the body just right, the crescent sling is the crossbody of the moment. With its curved silhouette and hands-free ease, it fits your essentials without bulk — perfect for running around the city or adding a modern touch to any look. Convertible Silhouettes These multitasking wonders are like two or three bags in one. Go crossbody for ease, carry by the top handles for a polished work look, or opt for a smaller-scale style for a night out. Unquestionably the best bang for your buck. Bucket Bags There was a distinct point in the 2010s when bucket bags reigned supreme — and that energy is back in the air. The open-top design makes for easy access to lip gloss, keys, and more, while modern updates like belted straps, woven leather, and sleek minimalist shapes keep things feeling fresh. Flap Bags Flap crossbody bags are a timeless go-to. Whether you choose a classic square shape, an asymmetrical cut, or sculptural hardware with a pop of color, this silhouette always delivers. Puffy \u0026 Padded The puffed-up trend isn’t just for coats and boots — it’s taken over bags, too. Durable, lightweight, and ultra-wearable, these styles hold up to daily wear while delivering peak winter utility, whether you’re slinging Lululemon’s viral belt bag or Free People’s oversized messenger.

    "description": "Taylor Swift's presence at NFL games has done more than just bring a new legion of fans to the sport; it's also given fashion girlies (like myself) an excuse to tune in each week for a glimpse at the star's commanding game-day looks. Last weekend, Swift attended the 2025 AFC Championship game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Buffalo Bills, decked out in a head-to-toe Louis Vuitton ensemble that offered a grunge, Blair Waldorf-inspired take on TikTok's loud-luxury trend - perhaps a callback to the Y2K aesthetic she sported throughout her original \"Reputation\" era? (Cue the speculation of Swifties everywhere.) Keeping in theme with the red and black color palette of her boyfriend, Travis Kelce's, Super Bowl-bound team, the pop star paired a logo Louis Vuitton hoodie and beanie with a preppy mini skirt, lace-up boots, and burgundy Calzedonia 50 Denier Total Comfort Soft Touch Tights ($15) - which perfectly matched Swift's red lips (because of course). The pop star-approved opaque tights are made from a polyamide material that's thick, without being too warm - making them a great wardrobe essential to have on hand year-round, but especially come winter. And with over 10 different colorways to shop - 3897 Dark Red being Swift's shade of choice - you can easily mix the colorful tights into your game-day wardrobe or Super Bowl outfit, regardless of the team you're rooting for. While the under-$20 accessory is one of the more affordable options in the musician's most recent game-day outfit, Swift has incorporated plenty of budget-friendly pieces into her past WAG looks - including a $35 knit beanie and custom New Balance sneakers.
