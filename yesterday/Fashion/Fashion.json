    "description": "If you're a fan of Reformation, you know it's not every day you find its incredible pieces discounted. The retailer hosts a couple big sales a year, but the coveted pieces sell out fast. Which is why I was totally shocked when I was browsing the sale section at Nordstrom and came across a huge selection of Reformation pieces. There are currently over 20 items marked down, and I could barely contain my excitement. In the assortment were a handful of items I've had my eye on for months, and I quickly snatched them up for up to 55 percent off. Ahead, I curated a list of my nine favorite pieces. Some I just bought and some I already own. So, what are you waiting for? I can tell you sizes are already selling out. Keep reading to shop and snag your favorites before it's too late.
