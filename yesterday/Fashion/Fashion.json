    "description": "After a busy February, another fashion month is coming to an end. Paris Fashion Week, which wraps the fall/winter 2025 showcases on March 11, is bringing the stylish festivities to a close. Following Vaquera and Dior kicking off PFW, and debuts from creative directors at Dries Van Noten and Tom Ford, there are still some big names set to take over runways — think Louis Vuitton, Miu Miu, and Chanel  — and, rest assured, crowds of models, designers, editors, content creators, and other industry pros are showing up and out dressed to impress in their best street style looks.  As usual, Paris Fashion Week attendees are doing what they do best: putting effortlessly stylish spins on the year’s biggest trends in a way that only they can. Think: modern-day LBDs, silhouettes that are just the right amount of oversized, extravagant coats, playful peep-toe shoes, ethereal organza, and so much more. Everywhere you look, there’s spring outfit inspiration to be found, whether in the form of styling hacks, new pieces to add to your closet, reinterpretations of well-worn staples, or just overall vibes. Scroll on to discover our favorite Paris Fashion Week street style looks from the fall/winter 2025 shows, and keep checking back as we update this post with more looks throughout the week.

    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Renee Rodriguez I'm just going to come right out and say it: it's time to talk about camel toes. We've all been there at one point or another - we slip on our favorite pair of workout leggings and running shoes, only to look in the mirror and see that we can see much more than we bargained for. Namely, the outline of our labia majora. While some of us may have no problem with the idea of showing a little extra, others might not feel so comfortable. I am firmly stationed in the latter camp, which is why when I first heard about the camel-toe-proof Jiv Athletics High Rise Thong ($35), I knew I had to get my hands on a pair immediately. Like most good things in my life, I discovered the existence of camel-toe-proof underwear while scrolling through my TikTok feed late one night. After seeing one video where a woman was praising how amazing the thongs were, I started seeing more and more videos of women calling out Jiv Athletics for their amazing underwear. (Thank you, TikTok algorithm.) While I eagerly awaited the arrival of my own pair, I decided to read up on what made this underwear so different from everything else I had tried in the past. What I Like About the Jiv Athletics Camel-Toe-Proof Thong After receiving them in the mail, I washed them in a delicates bag, hung them to dry, and patiently waited for my turn to finally be free of my dreaded camel toe. The first time I wore them I decided to try them on with a pair of leggings I purchased a few months ago. In all honesty, I hadn't worn my leggings even once since I purchased them, because no matter how many different pairs of underwear I tried on with them, I was always left with bunching in the crotch area. (I run into this issue a lot with leggings that have a seam down the center.) After I put on my new panties, I immediately noticed how lightweight the fabric was. It honestly felt like butter, and I loved the fact that they were seamless, so I wouldn't run into any issues with panty lines. The underwear is also tag-less, which already made them more comfortable than half of the options in my panty drawer. I wore them all day, and with the exception of when I had to use the restroom, I honestly forgot I was wearing underwear at all – they were that comfortable. And as for my camel toe? I'll spare you the before photo, but let's just say I would not be wearing these leggings without the assistance of my new favorite underwear. Who Is the Jiv Athletics Camel-Toe-Proof Thong Best For? If you wear tight-fitting clothing, including workout shorts or leggings, this is the underwear to grab. I'm excited to know that I can now purchase any leggings without needing to worry about bunching, readjusting, or feeling self-conscious. If you're like me, and have been searching for the answer to your camel toe woes, pick up a pair to add to your underwear collection. Additional Details These underwear are made with recycled fabrics and environmentally friendly dyes. They're also made from 82/18 percent recycled micro-polyester spandex, and they have an anti-microbial cotton gusset as well as a moisture-wicking outer shell and breathable cotton liner, which helps promote airflow *down there*. The real magic is in the 3D knitted molded spacer fabric, which provides an extra layer of coverage that makes camel toes a thing of the past. Where Is the Jiv Athletics Camel-Toe-Proof Thong Available? The Jiv Athletics camel-toe-proof thong is available to shop on the brand's website and on Amazon.

    "description": "Fashion Week introduces trends for the season to come, but it also keeps us firmly rooted in the current moment through street style. What people wear while skipping from one show to the next is often just as inspiring as anything you'll see walking down the runway - if not more so. New York Fashion Week is back to its roots with a packed schedule of in-person shows and events, running over the course of five days. It brings together style enthusiasts from across the world, all looking toward the coming season. This year, they stepped out in bold sartorial statements, from charmcore jewelry and accessories to corpcore suiting that turned heads. Other noteworthy street style trends included tenniscore skirts, coordinating sets, and dopamine dressing. On the footwear front, show goers continued to favor platforms and also took a tip from the runways by opting for stylish and comfortable walking shoes. But kitten heels, sneakers, and ballet flats remained a go-to for those looking to strike a balance between fashion and function. Outerwear favorites were primarily bold-hued and worn oversize, with statement trench coats cinched at the waist reigning supreme. And some of the top handbag brands spotted on style stars? Prada, Louis Vuitton, Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent, Staud, Coperni, and Brandon Blackwood, just to name a few. This season, PS Shopping's senior content director Jessica Andrews and associate director Sarah Wasilak attended NYFW shows sporting many shoppable new trends. Still, looks worn by past editors continue to remain relevant. Keep reading for a full recap on what the editorial team wore to Fashion Week through the season, and refresh your wardrobe with their exact items.",
