    "description": "Need a classic swimsuit for less than £40? A hat that’s easy to pack? Or the perfect beach-to-bar T-shirt? Make this summer a breeze with our fashion experts’ top tipsThere is a very specific panic around summer dressing – all that flesh on show, for starters. So it always seems strange just how little thought we give to it. Obviously you care what you look like, but think how much time and energy you put into finding the perfect winter coat, or boots to see you through the post-Christmas doldrums. Some of you probably save up, or at least try on a few different styles to see what you like. Compare that to choosing a swimsuit or shorts. How often do you buy something the day before you go on holiday, or even at the airport? You’ll probably spend more time in your coat and boots but still, it’s a bit daft panic-buying some sandals before finding out, mid-hike, that the back strap rubs your heel and they slip off the moment your feet get sweaty.The truth is that aside from the fact that people equate wearing fewer clothes with being cooler – not true! – it’s very hard to know what to wear when the sun comes out. So we are here to help. How about a tank that needs no bra, a swimsuit that doubles as a top, and a quick-dry, no-towel towel? Or a T-shirt for the guys that’s cocktail-approved – and a hat the kids will actually wear? Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/loft-deco-mini-wrap-skirt-review-with-photos-49452368",
    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography | Marisa Petrarca My earliest memories of Loft date back to when it was still called Ann Taylor Loft, when I'd tag along with my mom to help her pick out work outfits. It's been a minute since I've stepped foot in a store, but recently, my TikTok algorithm (which knows me frighteningly well) served up a few trending fashion picks from the brand's website. And honestly? Loft is delivering. The pieces feel exactly like the aesthetic I'm reaching for these days: elevated but effortless, polished yet comfortable. Cue me immediately adding the exact items they fed me to my cart: the Deco Mini Wrap Skirt ($35, originally $70) and the Ribbed Square Neck Sweater Tank Top ($27, originally $55). About the Loft Deco Mini Wrap Skirt The Loft Deco Mini Wrap Skirt is available in both regular and petite sizes. You can find it in stores and online. It's made of 100 percent lyocell and is machine washable. It measures 17.5 inches in length and features a straight, relaxed shift fit. What I Like About the Loft Deco Mini Wrap Skirt What I like most about the Loft Deco Mini Wrap Skirt is how it blends two trends I keep seeing on Pinterest: bandana prints and sarong-style silhouettes. The fit feels polished yet playful, and with the right accessories, I can wear it just as easily for daytime plans as I can for a night out. It's also incredibly easy to style. Admittedly, I'm not the most adventurous dresser, so this skirt speaks to my minimalist heart - it looks chic with anything black and white (though by all means, go bold if that's your thing). I paired it with a classic Loft tank I'll be wearing on repeat year-round, the Staud handbag I wear constantly, and a pair of strappy black heels. Lastly (and at the risk of sounding a little obsessed), I love that this skirt isn't an online exclusive. So many pieces sell out fast online and are nearly impossible to track down. Thankfully, it's also available in stores, and I noticed that several Minnesota locations near me still had it in stock. (Can't promise the same for you, but I'm hopeful!) Image Source: PS Photography | Marisa Petrarca What to Consider About the Loft Deco Mini Wrap Skirt Something to keep in mind about the Loft Deco Mini Wrap Skirt is that it's made of 100 percent lyocell, which the brand lists as machine washable in the product details. While that's true, I did a little digging and found that the best way to keep it looking its best long-term is to wash it on a delicate cycle in cold water with a mild detergent, then air dry. I'm admittedly reaching for cons here, but if you're planning to keep this piece in regular rotation, it's worth noting. Where Is the Loft Deco Mini Wrap Skirt Available? No shocker here: the Deco Mini Wrap Skirt is a Loft exclusive, available both in stores and online.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/amaya-espinal-muumuu-dress-love-island-usa-49452354",
    "description": "It's no secret that \"Love Island USA\" is impacting current culture as we know it. While it's far from the first love-centered reality show that we've seen, its popularity is especially referential. The show's foundational concept is unusual alone - being secluded on an island away from the outside world to find the love you've been looking for all your life. Islanders also played a significant role in season seven's massive impact, including Olandria Carthen and Nicolas Vansteenberghe's kiss that caused a massive crash-out at \"Love Island\" watch parties. Another highlight from the show that's still on our minds? Amaya Espinal (aka our sensitive gangster) wearing a muumuu in episode 28. While the New Yorker's bubbly personality and witty candor have given us plenty of meme-worthy moments to reflect on, her muumuu is far from just another piece of clothing that's passed the TikTok viral test. In an interview with the Today show, Espinal revealed that she only had a day to prepare for the show before being flown to Fiji, so she threw a bunch of clothing in a suitcase - including the muumuu she got during a trip to Portugal. \"Bringing that piece back to the villa reminded me of my travels and reminded me of the good days whenever I was having a bad one,\" she says. \"It was more than a dress for sure - it really made me feel grounded.\" @dontask724 just a girl and her moo moo against the world #amaya #amayaloveisland #amayapapaya #loveislandusa #loveisland #usa #fyp #viral ♬ original sound - 𓇼 Apart from the sentimental value it holds for Espinal, the muumuu bears cultural significance that's particularly noteworthy. The comfortable piece can be traced back to the early 19th century, when Christian missionaries in Hawaii influenced native women to wear the silhouette to further cultivate modesty. Hawaiian women adapted a more casual, sleeveless version - the \"holokū\" - for everyday wear, before it was renamed the muumuu. Fast forward to present day, the dress style is still acceptable in Western culture, and often a go-to purchase for vacations, Hawaiian-themed parties like luaus, and more. And of course, celebrities have proudly embraced the muumuu - most recently, Kris Jenner, Oprah Winfrey, and Gayle King were seen wearing them on a Mallorca getaway. Espinal wearing her own speaks to the diversity we need to see more of on reality shows, and is a surefire way to exhibit the fact that modesty is still attractive. During the scene in which she wore it, her partner, Bryan Arenales, complimented her look (despite her labeling it as a \"grandma dress\"). His support proves that you don't always need to show skin to be deemed attractive or desired - especially in the eyes of your romantic partner. While her exact dress isn't available to shop, we found similar picks that evoke the same level of style and confidence: Unique Kaftans Floral Print Long Tunic Dress ($3, originally $10), JaipurCraftandArt Cotton Kaftan ($27, originally $75), and H\u0026M Oversized Kaftan Dress ($75).

    "description": "Ever since Zac Posen joined the Gap Inc. fold and debuted GapStudio this spring, we haven’t been able to take our eyes off the elevated designs — or the celebrities wearing custom looks (hi, Anne Hathaway, Demi Moore, Cynthia Erivo, and Reneé Rapp). With serious star power backing the New York atelier, I was curious to see what the new summer collection — modeled by Lila Moss — looked like in real life. The brand’s already-iconic Draped Denim promises a “liquid-soft” texture that’s “made to move with you,” so I had to put it to the test. As a denim fanatic, I have my go-to comfy picks — mostly stretchy and baggy styles — but I typically avoid the fabric in the summer. Too hot, too suffocating. That is, until now. GapStudio’s denim has completely changed my perspective with its incredibly lightweight, soft, and flowy feel — so much so that I’m pretty sure I could sleep in it.Ahead, my honest review of GapStudio’s new drop, including the best buys from its denim, dresses, and more. DashDividers_1_500x100 GapStudio Jeans, Shorts \u0026 Tops The faded wide-leg denim trousers are definitely the pièce de résistance of this collection. Pros: They’re super flowy and lightweight, with a dramatic silhouette that’s still surprisingly versatile. Con: They don’t come in petite sizing! While I did some clever posing to show off the style, they were too long for my under-5’3” frame. The lack of petite and tall lengths is my biggest critique of GapStudio, but I’m hopeful sizing will expand as the line grows. The Mid Rise Baggy Jeans did fit better lengthwise, though (note: while this style is nearly sold out online, you can still find them in stores).  I did also really love the sheer cropped button-down, which, for some reason, made me feel like Lizzie McGuire. With the cuffs rolled up, it brings a cool, coastal vibe to an office staple. I paired the similar drapey denim button-down with matching high-rise denim shorts, which have a paperbag-type waistband and super-stretchy fit. I preferred these over the collection’s Low Rise Stride denim shorts, which are a bit more rigid and revealing. DashDividers_1_500x100 GapStudio Printed Dresses Since GapStudio’s denim is the real focus of the line, I was surprised that the rayon-viscose blend crepe dresses ended up being my favorite pieces. The “pebble print” gives abstract cheetah-meets-floral vibes and feels early-aughts-coded in the best way. The silhouettes are similarly nostalgic yet versatile.I enjoyed the midi dress the most, with its wide V neckline and fluttery sleeves. I can see myself wearing it to the office and for weekend brunches. The mini dress’s figure-skimming front seams and fit-and-flare silhouette make it ideal for seaside strolls… or any other casual summer plans. DashDividers_1_500x100 GapStudio Denim Dresses \u0026 Rompers I immediately felt like Britney Spears à la her 2001 American Music Awards all-denim look in the maxi slip denim dress. Again, I wish this style was offered in a petite length, but I can’t overlook how comfortable and lightweight it felt, or how much of a statement it makes. The denim shirtdress is more conservative and office-appropriate. If I had sized down, I think it would’ve enhanced my figure more, but a belt helped add shape to the straight silhouette. While it wasn’t the biggest win for me, there’s definitely potential to channel easy-breezy Laura Harrier energy in this piece. The Draped Denim Romper (pictured at the top) was a big winner for me — especially when sized down for a less baggy fit. It’s (you guessed it) soft and stretchy, plus the snap buttons and elasticized waist let you reveal or relax as much as you’d like. I didn’t feel constricted at all, making it a great pick for long summer festival days. Shop full GapStudio Summer Drop Like what you see?
