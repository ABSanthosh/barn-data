    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/birkenstock-shearling-lined-clogs-review-49421502",
    "description": "If you're like me and you couldn't find a pair of Birkenstock's Boston Soft Footbed Clogs in your preferred size and color a couple of seasons ago, it may have been for the best. Turns out, the shearling-lined fall- and winter-friendly iteration of the brand's popular clog is softer, cozier, and more comfortable than the Boston Soft Footbed Clogs. I pounced on buying Birkenstock's Boston Genuine Shearling Lined Clogs ($175) as soon as they appeared in Nordstrom's new arrivals section, and I've been wearing them nonstop. What I Love About Birkenstock's Shearling-Lined Clogs They feel like a fuzzy slipper but have the ergonomic design and comfortable yet sturdy footbed that Birkenstock's Boston clogs are known for. I was initially worried that the shearling lining might make my feet sweat, but unlike synthetic versions, genuine shearling is naturally temperature-regulating. On warmer days or when I quickly need to slip into something, I've worn them barefoot, but they also manage to look cool with a quarter sock on chillier days. When our editor reviewed the version without shearling, she was expecting them to be comfortable but was surprised by how versatile they are as well. I've been thrilled to discover the same thing as I've thrown these shearling-lined mules on with everything from leggings and sweats to barrel jeans and even a jumpsuit. As far as convenience goes, I love that I can put them on hands-free. As a mom of two little ones and a brand-new puppy, they've become my go-to for 6 a.m. potty breaks when I'm half-asleep and my hands are occupied with a leash, treats, and a squirming pup. What's Worth Noting About Birkenstock's Shearling-Lined Clogs At $175, they're an investment and pricier than Birkenstock's Boston Soft Footbed Clogs, but the shearling is a worthy upgrade. I opted for the taupe color which has a tonal aesthetic with the matching suede and shearling. I like that the color isn't too light or dark, but I was concerned about getting them stained with dirt and water. Amazingly enough, they still look practically new despite how much I've been wearing them. I've gotten clumps of dirt on them but have been able to easily brush the dirt off. I've even gotten caught in an unexpected sprinkle and the raindrops didn't stain the suede either. Who Are Birkenstock's Shearling-Lined Clogs Best For? Whether you want a pair of shoes that are comfortable and easy or are more concerned with crafting an effortless aesthetic, you'll be equally pleased. If you have sheepskins draped over furniture or a favorite pair of shearling-lined boots, these versatile shoes are a no-brainer. Additional Details About Birkenstock's Shearling-Lined Clogs If you're between sizes, order the next size up. These are built on a unisex shoe construction, but the sizes reflect women's shoe sizes. They have an adjustable strap with a buckle closure. They have a contoured footbed with arch support. Where Are Birkenstock's Shearling-Lined Clogs Available? You can buy these clogs at Nordstrom, Amazon, and Birkenstock. Rating: Angela Elias (she/her) is a contributing editor for PS Shopping.

    "description": "Ever stand in front of your jam-packed closet, staring at more than enough clothing options, and think: I have nothing to wear? Same. But perhaps the issue isn’t that you’re out of viable outfit choices. You just need a fresh dose of inspiration — say: 2025 outfit ideas — to help you see your wardrobe in a new way. That’s where Outfit Dump comes in. We supply you with enough ideas to fuel your style until the next drop comes along.  Here’s a radical thought: You don’t have to approach a new year intending to completely reinvent your life — especially not when it comes to fashion. Chances are, you already know what you like, with a closet’s worth of well-curated pieces to prove it. If you’re stuck in a style rut (we’ve all been there), you probably just need somewhere to look for inspiration to approach your existing wardrobe with a refreshed perspective and to help you understand your gaps better for when you do need to add new pieces.Well, you’re in luck: we have that inspiration for you right here. We’ve searched our Instagram feeds far and wide to find a selection of stylish, covetable outfits to help inspire your 2025 style. Ahead, you’ll find chic takes on cozy winterwear, office-appropriate suiting, bold animal prints and colors, and runway-approved trends to help you decide what to wear this year.2025 Outfit Idea: Suits With a Twist To up your officewear game in 2025, incorporate unexpected twists into your suiting — think oversized ‘fits with soft and loose garments, or mismatched separates, like seen on Emma Chamberlain here. 2025 Outfit Idea: Velvet To start the new year, we’re gravitating towards plush textural pieces that look luxe and make us feel good. The velvet set pictured here does exactly that — plus, its loose fit makes it another great play on the suit-with-a-twist concept.  2025 Outfit Idea: Suede Is velvet a bit too over the top for your style vibe? That’s okay — that’s what suede is for.2025 Outfit Idea: Animal Print If 2024 was the year of leopard print, what will 2025 bring? We’ll still be playing with animal prints of all kinds, like the brushed cow prints pictured here. 2025 Outfit Idea: Getting Sporty Elevated athletic style is in for 2025, and a simple way to ease yourself into the aesthetic is with a striped rugby sweater (which has already been having a moment). The baseball cap is optional but highly encouraged. 2025 Outfit Idea: Getting Sporty Are you already comfortable with the rugby sweater trend, but still want to get into the sporty look? Try a windbreaker or racing jacket, and don’t be afraid to experiment with dressing your chosen piece up. 2025 Outfit Idea: Oversized Scarf When you have to bundle up, an oversized scarf makes it feel like you’ve actually put together a complete look and aren’t just hiding it. 2025 Outfit Idea: Long Coat And if you do have to bundle up and want to skip the scarf, let a full-length wool coat become the centerpiece of your outfit.2025 Outfit Idea: Cape If the runways have anything to say about it, capes and draped pieces — such as hybrid dresses and cardigans — will be taking on new life in 2025.2025 Outfit Idea: Burgundy Because we’re not ready to leave the warmth and richness of burgundy red behind in 2024. Style it with accent pieces, like tights or a scarf, or go head-to-toe. 2025 Outfit Idea: Skirt Over Pants Yes, wearing a skirt over pants is back again, and we’re ready to embrace it with open arms (we think). 2025 Outfit Idea: Sheer Clothing The sheer trend is stronger than ever. Consider different layering techniques: What will you allow to peek through from beneath your sheer pieces, and what will you wear over them (an oversized blazer on top of a flowing sheer maxi skirt, like pictured here, for example?) while still getting some of the sexy effect? 2025 Outfit Idea: Denim + Color How can you wear a Canadian tuxedo without feeling like you're cosplaying Britney and Justin? Double up your favorite jeans and denim top, then put on a vibrant coat overtop and an equally bold pair of shoes to match. 2025 Outfit Idea: Mocha Mousse Borrow some style inspo from Pantone and don its 2025 Color of the Year, Mocha Mousse. The warm light brown shade will last in your closet long past when its Pantone crown has been passed on. 2025 Outfit Idea: Vibrant Hues Not into neutrals? Then don’t shy away from color! Bright hues like frog green, marigold, and periwinkle are also on the rise this year. You don’t have to mix and match neon shades, like in this example, but also: Why not go for it, right?2025 Outfit Idea: Colorblocked Sweater We’re of the opinion that you can never have enough chunky sweaters, and if you’re anything like us, most of yours are probably in reliable neutral shades. Why not add some color to your knitwear rotation?2025 Outfit Idea: Lady-Like Details Ladylike, ultra-femme details remain dominant, leaving room to style outfits that are soft, pretty, elegant — whatever that may look like for you. If you’re looking for ideas, try bubble hems, ruffles, or frilled collars. Like what you see?
