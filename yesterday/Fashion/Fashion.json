    "description": "Mapping out what you are going to wear each day saves you time and gives you peace of mindI’m sure ayahuasca is probably really great, but have you ever experienced the absolute rush you get when you have prepped a whole week’s worth of outfits in advance? No? Oh, then you haven’t lived. The thrill of it. The next-level smugness. The whole 10 minutes extra in bed every morning. The self-belief that comes from knowing you have nailed a killer look for the meeting you are dreading on Wednesday afternoon. This is what invincibility feels like, my friends.I’m not saying spontaneity is overrated, not exactly. Just that it has its place. And flicking through clothes hangers on a dark Monday morning when your phone is popping with work emails is not that place. There has always been a lifestyle trend for prepping meals, and it is rapidly advancing into fashion. Batch cooking is in vogue. TikTok is now full of uncannily wholesome looking influencers (possibly AI-generated: “Siri, make a perfect human being”) holding Tupperware boxes filled with colourful diced vegetables, as if proudly carrying a Fendi baguette bag. Meal planning for the week has a whole heap of advantages. It works out cheaper, you make healthier choices than you would in the moment, and it makes life simpler at the end of a busy day. Continue reading...",

    "description": "When she took over after her brother Gianni’s murder, few expected her to last 27 years and become a household nameNews: Donatella Versace hails brother as she bows out as creative directorWhen Donatella Versace took over the house of Versace in the aftermath of her brother Gianni’s murder, most observers privately assumed that her reign would be no more than a postscript. The bottle-blond younger sister, with no formal training and a drug addiction that was the fashion industry’s worst kept secret, was seen as a sentimental appointment by a shell-shocked family.She proved everyone wrong. Versace is now defined as much by Donatella as by Gianni. She steps down from designing after 27 years as an icon in her own right, one of the most successful female designers in modern fashion history. Sober for 20 years, she has steered Versace to become a global household name, valued at $2bn (£1.6bn) when it was sold to Capri Holdings six and a half years ago. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/lululemon-dual-pouch-wristlet-review-49335470",
    "description": "These days, I'm adamant about removing as much baggage from my life as possible - both metaphorically and literally. I've long been a fan of Lululemon's cult-favorite Belt Bag because of its compact yet functional design, but I've recently been coveting something even smaller for my day-to-day activities - like gym-trips, running errands, or basically any other scenario where I'd prefer to carry as little as possible. Lo and behold, Lululemon is actually the genius behind yet another viral accessory that pairs the brand's signature, sporty aesthetic with a lightweight and easy-to-carry bag design. Enter: the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet ($78). Chronically online folks (like myself) are likely all too familiar with this compact accessory, as it's become a mainstay on TikTok's \"For You\" page (and a go-to personal travel bag) for dozens of fashion editors and influencers alike. With all the hype surrounding this stylish pouch, I couldn't help but wonder if the accessory was really worth all of the internet craze, especially in light of the obsession surrounding its mid-size predecessor. Curious - and frankly looking for an excuse to spend my Lululemon gift card - I bought and tested the Dual Pouch Wristlet and sought to answer the many questions surrounding the accessory. Why is everyone so obsessed with Lululemon's Dual Pouch Wristlet? How much can you actually fit in the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet? Is there a better Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet dupe to shop online? I answer all of that, and more, ahead. How Was I Influenced to Buy the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet? Similar to most of my product buys these days, TikTok introduced and ultimately influenced me to purchase the Dual Pouch Wristlet. For months, I've seen users tout the accessory in videos and Instagram reels, all showing off the different ways that they use the pouch in their day-to-day lives. Some rave that it's their go-to gym bag because it holds their keys, Apple AirPods, and credit cards, all in one convenient place. Others swear it's the perfect bag alternative for travel because it eliminates the fear of pickpocketing thanks to its handheld design. @gabilemoine What should i put in the grey pouch?! Currently i havent put anything in there yet so maybe ill take that piece off for now but if theres something you think i should put in it let me know! #lululemon #lululemoncreator #lululemondualpouchwristlet @lululemon ♬ If It's Lovin That You Want (Sped Up) - Tazzy What I Like About the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet For me, the wristlet's customizable design is a huge part of its appeal. Both of the pouches are detachable from the product's main hook, meaning you can add or remove them as you like. I can also attach other items to the main hook, like my car keys or mace, so it's a great modular accessory for those who prefer something that they can easily make their own. The wristlet is also made from a 100 percent recycled nylon material that's sleek to the touch and relatively easy to keep clean; per the brand, you can simply spot clean it to remove any stains or dirt. Despite its compact design, the pouches can also hold quite a bit - including several credit cards, cash, a small lipstick, and anything else you'd like to keep handy. The actual wristlet is pretty open and stretchy, so you can comfortably wear it around your wrist without fear of skin irritation. And with a wide variety of tones and colorways (including new ones for fall), there are so many fun options to shop that feel totally unique to the traditional cardholder or wallet. What's Worth Noting My biggest qualm with this accessory is the lack of cardholder slots on the inside of the pouch. Prior to purchasing one of my own, I'd always assumed that the accessory would at least have one or two slots to keep items like credit cards or my driver's license secure, similar to the design of a traditional cardholder. While this doesn't affect the security of the piece - I still feel comfortable carrying around the accessory with items that I'd normally store in my wallet - I do think that having an extra interior slot or compartment would make all the difference in keeping items separated and thus easier to pull out whenever needed. Reviewers on Lululemon's site also noted that the light-colored variations tend to dirty faster than dark-colored ones, while others noted that the accessory's material frayed sooner than they expected. One reviewer wrote: \"Fabric frayed and hardware tarnished within first few months.\" I've had my pouch for a little less than a month and haven't noticed any significant wear and tear yet, but it's certainly something to be mindful of, given this product's higher price tag. Because several reviews cited issues with discoloration on shades like the white opal and flush pink colorway, I also chose to order mine in the classic black and traverse gray tones. If you want to avoid dirtying your bag too quickly, I recommend opting for one of the darker shades. Who Is the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet Best For? This wristlet is perfect for anyone who wants to cut back on their carrying capacity each day - without having to sacrifice on style in the process. The accessory has just enough space to hold the essentials, giving you the freedom to carry what you need and nothing more. Unlike traditional cardholders or clutches, it also has a durable design that'll hold up regardless of the weather or circumstance. It's the perfect embodiment of stylish functionality, and it's a great alternative for those who are tired of lugging around large accessories to the gym, while traveling, or even just running errands. Additional Details: Lululemon's Dual Pouch Wristlet is made from a durable, water-repellent fabric that's designed for on-the-go wear. Thanks to its hook design, the pouches are completely detachable, so you can customize the look and functionality of the accessory. It's available in different colorways on Lululemon's site, including black and traverse gray (my shades of choice). Where Is the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet Available to Shop? This accessory is available to shop exclusively at Lululemon. Rating: Kyley Warren (she/her) is an award-winning writer and editor with more than four years of experience in the publishing space.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/lewis-hamilton-fashion-outfits-49193195",
    "description": "There's no doubt about it, Lewis Hamilton is a driving force in the world of fashion. The Formula 1 driver has become almost as famous for his love of bright, bold, and eccentric outfits as he has for his many championship titles, and there's no sign of him putting the brakes on his wardrobe choices anytime soon. With a number of races under his belt this season, Hamilton has regularly been spotted in the paddock wearing an array of looks that put him in first place in the fashion stakes. Notably, he did so before it became a trend among athletes as fashion pages dedicated to driver style like F1 Paddock Fits can attest. The 40-year-old has regularly discussed his personal style, which often includes a mix of emerging, diverse designers and pieces from larger fashion houses. In a previous interview with Vogue, Hamilton said: \"Fashion is about freeing yourself - it's about self-expression; it's about you; it's about slowly, over time, evolving and learning more about yourself and what you like and how you want to show up - how you want to be seen. What makes you feel great? It's a great feeling when you put on a piece of clothing and throw your shoulders back and are just like: I feel great today. That's what fashion does.\" Hamilton works with stylist Eric Mcneal; is conscious of the environmental impact of fashion; and is constantly striving to promote more diversity, both within motorsport and the fashion industry. He's cohosting the Met Gala in May 2025 and he's a fitting choice for the theme \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,\" which celebrates the history and enduring impact of Black dandyism. When the famed driver attended the Met Gala in 2021, he used his platform to invite three emerging Black designers to his table (Theophilio, Kenneth Nicholson, and Jason Rembert of Aliétte). He was also cast as the star of Valentino's Fall 2022 campaign, modeling Pierpaolo Piccioli pink alongside Zendaya, chosen for his influence beyond the race track. As he makes his bid to bag another championship this year, take a pit stop and scroll ahead for all the times Hamilton has turned the paddock into a runway.",

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. As we pack away puffer jackets and faux-fur coats, it’s time to refresh our closets with spring-ready alternatives. It’s not consistently warm yet, so transitional styles are key for chilly or rainy spring days. Unsurprisingly, some of the biggest spring 2025 outerwear trends are fresh spins on fall 2024 favorites. Think barn jackets (in lighter fabrics), capes (on trench coats), vests (tied up with bows), and denim jackets (with bold barrel sleeves).Other styles worth keeping on your radar? Quilted jackets for a touch of classic, cottage-core charm and, on the opposite end of the spectrum, retro track jackets with so-sporty vibes. No matter your personal style, there’s an outerwear trend below to complement (and elevate) it.Read on for spring outfit inspiration and to start carting up your favorite pieces before the post-spring-cleaning shopping frenzy hits. DashDividers_1_500x100 Barrel-Sleeve Denim Jackets Ever since barrel-leg jeans shot to popularity in 2024 — cementing themselves as must-have denim — their unique curved shape has migrated upward. Enter: the barrel-sleeve denim jacket. The balloon-like sleeves, often paired with dropped shoulders, bring a fresh dimension to a forever staple. From oversized trucker styles to fitted, lady-like silhouettes, there’s a wash and shape for every denim lover. DashDividers_1_500x100 Quilted Jackets Shoppers have been searching for “spring quilted jackets” lately, and we see why: they’re the ultimate in-between-season layer. Typically boxy with roomy patch pockets, these lightly padded jackets offer plenty of layering potential. But thanks to their cropped, collarless silhouettes, they’re just as warm-weather-friendly too. Keep it sleek in solids and satins, or go playful with floral prints and trending hues like butter yellow. DashDividers_1_500x100 Cape Trench Coats From scarf coats to cape jackets, outerwear has been in its evolving era, and the cape trench coat is the latest twist on a classic. The biggest iterations right now? Capes on cropped trenches and sleeveless poncho styles. Look out for water-resistant fabrics (think nylon) and details like detachable scarves or hoods — because April showers are imminent. DashDividers_1_500x100 Sporty Track Jackets Yes, we called it — sporty style is a major fashion trend in 2025, and now’s the time to hop on board. One of the easiest ways to work the aesthetic into your wardrobe (besides through your spring sneakers) is with outerwear. While varsity jackets, windbreakers, and anoraks all fit the bill, a retro track jacket is the move. Picture high-collar zip-ups, bold color-blocking, and contrast piping for maximum throwback appeal. DashDividers_1_500x100 Tie-Front Jackets \u0026 Vests Bows just won’t quit, but who’s complaining? This season, the romantic detail is showing up in the form of functional bow tie closures on jackets and vests — both of which are super transitional. You’ll also spot them combined with other key trends, like quilting and denim, making it easier than ever to check multiple style boxes at once. DashDividers_1_500x100 Barn Jackets If you haven’t yet hopped on the barn jacket train, consider this your boarding call. This workwear-inspired staple made a high-fashion resurgence in fall 2024, and now it’s reemerging in lightweight fabrics like cotton and canvas for spring. With wind-shielding collars, oversized pockets, and an air of rugged utility, these jackets bring a touch of the fisherman aesthetic to your seasonal lineup. Like what you see?

    "description": "Spring, and the trends that come with it, are the ultimate reset — golden-hour strolls, that first jacket-free afternoon, and the undeniable urge to swap neutrals for something brighter. But the yo-yo weather that comes with the season has me frozen trying to figure out how to dress, let alone what new pieces I should add to my rotation. Maybe it’s the fashion editor in me, but I’m also already deep in the throes of analyzing the freshly debuted fall 2025 collections, making pinpointing what feels new right now trickier than usual. Yet, somehow, Nordstrom’s Spring Sale always helps me refocus and zero in on the staples and playful pieces I know I don’t want to be without — all while avoiding the dreaded overspend (which, I’ll admit, I’m incredibly guilty of).So, what’s on my list? Minimalist flats — my go-to for stylish practicality. A light layering jacket, a.k.a. the holy grail of spring dressing. And, while I’ve always considered myself a \"dress girl,\" lately, I’ve been craving more mix-and-match separates, from the latest trending denim to unfussy tops and knits I can put my own spin on with fun bags, sleek jewelry, and bold sunnies. Of course, loungewear remains a staple — for working from home, running errands, and traveling. (Come to think of it, I do need a new swimsuit for my upcoming vacay in Aruba!)Click through for my seasonal picks, all available to shop for less right now (while stock lasts!). Nordstrom’s Spring Sale runs from March 12 to March 24, so get moving to scoop up to 50% off your favorite brands.All linked products are independently selected by our editors.
