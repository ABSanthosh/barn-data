Here’s how to find durable jeans, boots with welly and more• Don’t get Fashion Statement delivered to your inbox? Sign up hereThis week more than most, we have been hearing a certain word uttered in fashion circles. Alongside “janties”, “Hedi Slimane” and “kilts”, a perhaps less expected – or, at least, less glitzy – word has been taking up airtime: durability. It comes off the back of Primark’s new Durability Framework, which the fast-fashion giant says is “designed to set the bar for how retailers can extend the life of their clothing – meaning our customers will ultimately be able to love and wear their clothes for longer”.“Durability shouldn’t be a luxury,” the retailer continued. But while the importance of extending the life of clothes is in no doubt – figures from environmental NGO WRAP show that using an item for nine months can reduce carbon, waste, and water footprints by up to 30% – Primark’s business model is designed to sell masses of clothes at extremely low prices, arguably fuelling a “buy once, wear once” mentality. So it comes as little surprise that Patrick Duffy, founder of the Global Fashion Exchange, describes the announcement as “a textbook example of greenwashing” and “nothing more than a marketing tactic to polish their image”.

And he of all people should know. Wainwright spent his life charting every nook and cranny of the notoriously wet and windy Lake District. But he never let a bit of bad weather get between himself and the great outdoors. And nor should you.Autumn is a surprisingly pleasant time to venture outside. Yes, it can be damp and cold. But let’s focus on the positives: there are fewer people to share the trails with, and the golden-brown leaves create stunning scenery to be enjoyed exclusively by those bold enough to brave the elements. Besides, that crisp autumn air is far more pleasant to hike in than the suffocating summer heat. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Bubble skirts are the bottoms to have on your radar this fall. The voluminous, hyperfeminine style that dominated summer is no fleeting trend: Its hold on fashion continues into the colder months, proving it’s more versatile than you might think. The puffy-hemmed bottoms appeared across fall/winter 2024 runways, from Simone Rocha’s demure sheer minis to Molly Goddard’s wide tulle midis. Nicolas Ghesquière doubled down on bubble skirts in Louis Vuitton’s Cruise 2025 collection — and Zendaya gave them her seal of approval at the brand’s spring 2025 show during Paris Fashion Week. Alaïa, meanwhile, introduced funnel-like versions for spring/summer 2025 and Chloé brought out light-toned, embroidered styles. We know bubble skirts have staying power — they’ve been a statement piece since the ‘80s, when Vivienne Westwood’s punk puffballs and Christian Lacroix’s extravagant, layered skirts were party wear staples. They’re still fun and festive but can also be styled down for more casual activities. Fall calls for a bubble skirt on top of jeans or trousers to channel that Y2K aesthetic, with tights or thermal leggings for extra warmth, or with a matching top for a co-ordinated look. Style with sneakers, heels, or knee-high boots and don’t be afraid to experiment with color and pattern, too. Ready to find the right bubble skirt for you?
