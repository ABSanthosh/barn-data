Our fashion guru reveals how you can shake up your wardrobe for the new season• The best Chanel-style jackets to rival the real thingIn the winter months, I crave the comfort of repetition. I want to make a vat of soup to keep in the fridge and have a bowl for lunch every day. I long to discover a TV drama that I have somehow missed and have seasons to catch up on so that I can watch an episode every night. Hibernation, essentially.Then, after months of that, the clocks go forward and – like clockwork – I get an itch for novelty. Yesterday I went to refresh the water in a vase of flowers on the mantelpiece; 15 minutes later all the stems were piled up around me on the floor and I was curating a whole new arrangement. Change is good! In the mood to shake something up? Out with the old. In with the newness! Read on for some hot-off-the-press thoughts. Continue reading...",

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Festival season is in full swing, with Rolling Loud and Lollapalooza Chile wrapped, and Coachella quickly approaching. That means it’s time to plan your music festival outfits. Each festival has its own flare when it comes to the genres and musical acts, the venues, and, of course, the crowd’s fashion.So if you want to dress on theme for this spring and summer’s hottest music marathons, we curated mini style guides for each kind of vibe. Whether you’re in search of a fringe jacket for a desert festival, durable boots for a camping festival, an all-denim fit for a big city festival, or a breezy dress for a seaside festival, we’ve got you covered with all the essentials you could need and want.And just as music taste has no boundaries, neither should your fashion sense. So mix and match from the different guides below to concoct the perfect outfits for all your hip-hop, EDM, and country concerts. (And if you don’t happen to have any festivals lined up this summer, don’t sweat it. Because if you’re going to Beyonce’s Cowboy Carter tour or Bad Bunny’s Puerto Rico residency, there are plenty of styles below to take inspo from for these musical events, too.)Scroll on to learn more about the clothing, shoes, and accessories (including styles from some of our favorite brands’ festival collections) that should be included in your concert outfit lineup. DashDividers_1_500x100 Desert Music Festival Outfits Whether you’ve secured a coveted ticket to Coachella (April 11-20) or Stagecoach (April 25-27) in Indio, California (or have another desert festival on the horizon), you need outfits to withstand the sunny days and chilly nights ahead. These festivals (and their scenery) are synonymous with effortless, breezy, boho style, so incorporate fringe, wide-brim hats, and cowboy boots. Then at night, layer up with linen button-downs or light cardis (that can easily fit into your crossbody bag throughout the day). DashDividers_1_500x100 Grass \u0026 Camping Music Festival Outfits Planning on camping stateside at Bonnaroo (June 12-16) or Outside Lands (August 8-10), or traveling for Glastonbury (June 25-29) or Tomorrowland (July 18-27)? You’ll want to be strategic about your festival outfits, picking versatile, comfortable styles that can trek from stage to stage and last from day to night. For these grass-field festivals, consider supplementing your indie sleaze ‘fits with durable boots or utilitarian sneakers (that can handle muddy terrain). DashDividers_1_500x100 City Music Festival Outfits In big cities, you can get away with any kind of aesthetic. For East Coast spring festivals like Boston Calling (May 23-25) and New York’s Governor’s Ball (June 6-8), the weather shouldn’t be too warm yet, so consider a denim-on-denim outfit or jean dress. Meanwhile, for Midwestern events like Summerfest (June 19-July 5) and Lollapalooza (July 31-August 3), the heat will be in full force, so opt for shorts and light fabrics. Then for Essence Festival (July 3-6) in New Orleans, which takes place both indoors and outside, keep it casual and cute with skorts and statement sneakers. DashDividers_1_500x100 Beach \u0026 Boardwalk Music Festival Outfits Whether your toes are literally in the sand at Sand In My Boots (May 16-18), you’re overlooking the Balearic Sea at Primavera Sound (June 4-8), or you’re enjoying a boardwalk breeze at Sea.Hear.Now (September 13-14), keep it effortless and cool in styles you’ll want to rewear all summer long. Vibe out to your favorite music seaside in a comfortable outfit like a crochet matching set or a sea-through maxi dress (worn over a bathing suit). Don’t forget a baseball cap or sunhat for extra protection. And for shoes, consider a pair of waterproof chunky sandals that won’t fly off mid-dance session. Like what you see?

    "description": "Ever stand in front of your jam-packed closet, staring at more than enough clothing options, and think: I have nothing to wear? Same. But perhaps the issue isn’t that you’re out of viable outfit choices. You just need a fresh dose of inspiration — say: festival outfit ideas — to help you see your wardrobe in a new way. That’s where Outfit Dump comes in. We supply you with enough ideas to fuel your style until the next drop comes along.Festival season is upon us, and it’s kicking off with arguably one of the most fashion-forward events on the calendar: Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Celebs, influencers, and music lovers are all descending upon the desert of Southern California the weekends of April 11 and April 18, 2025, offering us months worth of outfit inspo in the process.From boho fringe to eye-catching glitter and Western-inspired elements, there's lots to love in the world of festival fashion right now. So we've rounded up some top festival looks from Coachella and beyond to inspire your approach to summer concert dressing this year.Festival Outfit Idea: Sporty Preppy What do you get when you blend tenniscore, polo shirts, and cowboy boots? The perfect low-effort festival outfit. Festival Outfit Idea: Bikini Top + SkirtNot only is this crochet bikini top-fringed maxi skirt combo so much fun, but it will help you stay cool while spending hours dancing under the sun. Festival Outfit Idea: Crochet Matching Set Boho chic is back, at least according to the runways. A crochet matching set is an easy way to try your hand at the trend at music festivals.Festival Outfit Idea: Y2K Butterflies  Fashion “rules” don’t matter on festival fields, so relish in the kitschy, not-so-practical trends of yesteryear. This Y2K-inspired butterfly top and ruffled skirt? *Chef’s kiss.* Festival Outfit Idea: Sheer Dress Sheer dresses are a festival fashion staple, but we like the added shine the sequins and rhinestones add to this outfit. Have fun layering with pieces that will peek through to make this ’fit your own. Festival Outfit Idea: Cargo Pants We love how utilitarian cargo pants feel dressed-up and feminine when styled with a floral bustier — plus, you’ll be *so* comfy. Festival Outfit Idea: Head-to-Toe GlitterAny music festival can be your time to shine as brightly as the acts on stage.Festival Outfit Idea: Hot Pants Take a page from Olivia Rodrigo’s on-stage fashion, and hit up your chosen festival in a pair of trendy hot pants, bedazzled or not. You can style them with a pair of personality-forward tights for both the aesthetic and extra protection from the elements.Festival Outfit Idea: Crochet Mini Dress Not only is a crochet mini dress colorful and fun, but it’ll also keep you cool during a long day spent outdoors (and is easy to layer with should you need to). Extra points here for the red cowboy boots — yeehaw! Festival Outfit Idea: Fringe Lean into the Western trend with fringed, well, everything. If you want to be slightly more subtle, make one fringed piece the star of your outfit.Festival Outfit Idea: Cowboy BootsWestern-inspired fashion has long been a pillar of Coachella fashion, but this is the golden age of the festival cowgirl. We love these bright red, butterfly motif cowboy boots paired with a simple feminine skirt-and-tank combo.Festival outfit idea: Cowboy BootsMake your cowboy boots poolside party ready with a brightly colored swimsuit, sheer skirt, and sparkling Western-style hat.Festival outfit idea: leather-on-leatherIf the thought alone of wearing leather in the summer has you breaking a sweat, then look away — because two-piece sets in the durable fabric (and/or its vegan alternatives) are proving to be fashion's glossiest outfit formula for the season ahead.Festival outfit idea: cowboy hatNot feeling the boots? Cowboy hats are still very much a festival staple that can be recycled for a great horse girl fashion moment this summer, but it's the floret, shoulder-bearing top here that's really caught our attention (swipe right for a closer look). Festival outfit idea: swimsuit as a topLooking to style your easiest, breeziest button-down this summer? Wear it open over a black bikini top and some jeans.Festival Outfit Idea: Swimsuit as a TopMake your best one-piece swimsuit your hottest summer 'fit — just add sneakers.Festival Outfit Idea: Scarf TopGen-Z style queen Storm Reid is bringing back the early-2000s scarf top trend, and we're not mad about it.Festival Outfit Idea: Neon Hues Stand out from the massive crowd by mixing and matching vivid neon hues — the more the merrier, we say. Festival Outfit Idea: FloralsWondering if you're overdoing it on the florals? Fear not, fashion friends — there's simply no such thing.Festival Outfit Idea: Belly ChainWe're all about this bra top and belly chain pairing. Extra points for the butterfly motif necklace.Festival outfit idea: Y2K butterfliesHaven't you heard? The early aughts are back in fashion. So, the more butterflies, the merrier...Festival outfit idea: Y2K butterfliesHaven't you heard? The early aughts are back in fashion. So, the more butterflies, the merrier...especially in the form of the Dua Lipa-approved butterfly top. Festival outfit idea: chunky sneakersConsider this a masterclass in dressing down a sparkly kaftan by adding some chunky sneakers and funky patterned socks to the mix. Festival outfit idea: babydoll dressBlack bow, black boots, and a baby doll dress. Now there's a sweet and summery outfit trifecta if we ever did see one. Festival outfit idea: midi dressNo back? No problem. Summer is the unofficial season of exposed skin, after all. Festival outfit idea: platform shoesYes, it was the neon mini dress here that caught our eye, but it's those ultra-on-trend platform flip-flops that got us staring. Festival Outfit Idea: Chunky Sneakers Let’s face it: You’re going to need some form of comfort while standing on your feet all weekend. Pick your favorite pair of statement sneakers, style the rest of your outfit around them, and dance away.Festival Outfit Idea: DenimWe're calling it: The denim mini vest will continue to dominate the festival circuit.Festival Outfit Idea: DenimOr you could go full-on Canadian Tuxedo (but make it desert-friendly).Festival Outfit Idea: Tank Top and Baggy JeansWhite tank top, baggy jeans, midriff, belt. Leave it to Hailey Bieber to demonstrate an easy summer outfit formula that’ll last a lifetime.Festival Outfit Idea: Baggy Jorts Too hot for your fave pair of baggy jeans? Try baggy jorts instead.Festival Outfit Idea: Rubber BootsLet's normalize wearing practical, weather-proof shoes as a major fashion statement, please.Festival Outfit Idea: Tie-DyeWhen else are you going to wear tie-dye to dance in the desert?Festival Outfit Idea: Leather HarnessTake all the frolicky, flirty, festival-y appeal of a tiered dress and balance it with something a bit more hardcore, like this leather harness.Festival Outfit Idea: Mini SkirtJust because maxi skirts are trending doesn’t mean you should be ditching your favorite mini. Festival outfit idea: mini skirtCase in point. For an even more festival-approved look, pair the mini with cowboy boots.Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/Wedding-Guest-Dresses-43766105",
    "description": "It's no secret that getting a gorgeous letter-pressed wedding invitation in the mail brings immediate excitement. Your eyes quickly scan the location and before you know it, you're on Pinterest gathering a mood board or scrolling through Farfetch to find that standout ensemble that'll earn you the title of best-dressed for the night. As exhilarating as the search for the perfect wedding guest dress can be, it can easily get stressful when there's a dress code involved. We have nothing against them, but a dress code has the power to make your shopping escapade a breeze or a headache - especially when they're unofficial. Wedding attire has become unconventional in recent years, but apparently, stern rules still apply if you're Sydney Sweeney. The \"Anyone But You\" star recently caused a stir for wearing a blue corset dress (that's close to white) to co-star Glen Powell's sister's wedding. The viral outfit has left the internet divided on what's acceptable wedding attire versus what isn't. But let's be real, you can wear anything you want to a wedding. We've seen everything from TikTok trends done right like the stomach pudge dress to guests dressed in all-white that's totally cosigned by the bride herself (just like Solange Knowles's iconic ceremony). Surely, a blue dress is more than acceptable, too. Whether you're attending an upcoming wine-country wedding that's sure to be warm or an indoor ceremony with a cocktail party dress code (that's not super strict), we found a handful of wedding guest dresses that are bound to catch your eye. From florals for spring to formal pieces that are equal parts boundary-pushing and stylish, we've gathered our top picks that you'll want to wear on repeat. Now all that's left is to pick out something from the registry and get it wrapped in time - easy peasy. Shop our top wedding guest dresses ahead.",
