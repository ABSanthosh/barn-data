That was the message from a show marking the 110th anniversary of haute couture at Chanel. The house is in the middle of more than a year of catwalk shows without a designer to take a bow – Virginie Viard made her final appearance last May, and her successor, Matthieu Blazy, will not make his first until October – so it is working overtime to keep the Chanel name in lights.The catwalk was formed of two broad curving walkways, which together formed the double C that is instantly recognisable as Chanel.

Thankfully, 2025 has plenty of glamorous occasions to keep us entertained as we shake off the shock, dust off our laptops, and jump back into the grind. The Golden Globes kicked off awards season with a long list of fashion and beauty knockout moments. Our favorites of the night were Ayo Edebiri’s ‘90s Julia Roberts-inspired gray Loewe suit, Zendaya’s burnt orange satin Louis Vuitton gown, and Kylie Jenner’s direct homage to Elizabeth Hurley’s backless Versace number, which really got the people talking. While our gaze is fixed on the red carpet for more amazing looks as the season ramps up, we’re also keeping an eye on the exciting launches happening in the fashion and beauty space this month.

The partnership between the two French brands infuses the former’s modern aesthetics with the latter’s classic dance style. (Repetto was founded in 1947 as a ballet shoe company.) The result is two shoe styles: the leather Lilouh flat, embossed with Serre’s signature crescent moon on the toe, and the Camille ballerina, which features a 1-inch block heel and is available in denim, black, white, and fire red moon prints. “As a child, I was captivated by the elegant style of Repetto ballerinas,” Serre said, in a press release. “On top of that, they were crafted near my home in Saint Médard d’Excideuil. For my sister and I, it was magical to visit this factory, which introduced us to the world of craftsmanship.”Shop now at repetto.com Repetto x Marine Serre Lilouh Ballet Flats, $, available at RepettoLouis Vuitton x Murakami Re-Edition CollectionWith Zendaya fronting the campaign, Louis Vuitton is straight out of the gate with the collaboration of the year.

Toronto-based jewelry designer Jenny Bird is keeping things classic with an array of heart-shaped accessories including a padlock heart pendant necklace, heart button studs, and a gold ring adorned with a dangling heart charm. Our favorites have to be the subtle heart puff earrings, which appear sculptural from the front and more abstract from the side view — perfect for the lovergirls who like to keep things on the down-low. Shop at Jenny BirdXO, Kitty x Good Light CosmeticsFor the rom-com lovers among us, the return of To All The Boys spinoff XO, Kitty is a welcome distraction from the miserable January weather.
