(Classic solitaire diamond — check!) But if you’re undecided on what style best aligns with your personal taste, rest assured there’s never been a better time to be on the market for an engagement ring.  Bespoke designs, antique finds, and modern stones and silhouettes are all on offer thanks to the rise of independent jewelry designers and vintage marketplaces, making a diverse range of ring styles now widely accessible. “Screengrab any rings you like on Instagram, Pinterest, or any other visual platforms you use often, and save those photos as inspiration,” suggests Yi Collection founder Yi Guo, adding that, after a while, you’ll notice a pattern of what you like. From there, begin to take stock of what’s most important to you in an engagement ring.  “Do you want a standout solo stone? Are you intrigued by antique styles? Or maybe into a design that feels a bit more unique? Once you’ve nailed the general vibe of your ideal wedding ring, that can help you narrow in on what appeals to you specifically,” Stone and Strand founder Nadine Kahane says.  Then comes the fun part: Setting up an in-person appointment to try on several options. “Pieces can look very different on, so it’s great to be able to get an idea of what suits you,” designer Jessie Thomas says. If the idea of being involved in the choosing of your ring strips away the excitement, consider tapping your partner for help.  “I’m not opposed to going old-school and letting your partner pick,” says Starling founder Chelsey Bartrum, who had her husband choose her engagement ring. “I would have been way too indecisive and liked everything otherwise.” She does have a word of advice to steer them in the right direction: “Make sure they know a few jewelers you’re drawn to so the style matches you — that way, you’ll know they’re in good hands picking it out.” Ahead, our jewelry experts share their predictions for the engagement ring trends that will shine brightly in 2025, from cuts and settings to metals and gemstones. 2025 Engagement Ring Trend: Three Stones While a standalone gemstone can make a beautiful statement, a multi-stone silhouette is equally striking. “Three-stone engagement rings are gaining in popularity, particularly those that have oversized diamonds and a mix of unique diamond shapes, like a cushion or oval center stone paired with half-moon or pear side stones,” Kahane says. DashDividers_1_500x100 2025 Engagement Ring Trend: Heirloom Cuts Nostalgia continues to drive engagement ring trends, particularly when it comes to diamond cuts. “We’re seeing Asscher and cushion cut stones become more popular, as well as old mine cut stones,” Kahane says. “They feel more special as they’re one of a kind, and the antique stones each come with a unique backstory.” Even when these stones are cut new, she adds, they can still give an engagement ring more of an heirloom feel.  Bartrum notes that we’re also seeing lab-grown diamonds cut in these vintage-style facets. “I think their popularity will only increase with the more accessible price point,” she says. DashDividers_1_500x100 2025 Engagement Ring Trend: Wavy Bands While the gemstone you select for your engagement ring undoubtedly has a major impact on the overall look and feel of your ring, don’t forget about the band’s role as well: Chunky gold bands have continued to rise in popularity, and Kahane sees wiggly shapes following a similar trajectory in 2025. “A ring with a slight curve or wave in the band has a sleek yet unique feel to it,” she says. “I love it for someone who likes to keep things simple.” DashDividers_1_500x100 2025 Engagement Ring Trend: Colorful Stones Colorful, non-diamond gemstones have been on the engagement ring trend circuit for several seasons now, but it’s predicted to become even more dominant in 2025. “I’m very passionate about thinking outside the diamond box and getting a colored stone or birthstone engagement ring if that suits you better,” Bartrum says.  In terms of value, it can be a smarter choice, Guo argues: “Choosing a valuable colored gemstone as the center stone of an engagement ring is not only beautiful but can be a great investment as well. A five-carat Paraiba engagement ring I designed six years ago is probably worth nearly five times in value today!” DashDividers_1_500x100 2025 Engagement Ring Trend: Heavy Yellow Gold For those with a penchant for yellow gold, 2025 will be your year, as “heavy yellow gold” really hits its stride. “Heavy yellow gold solitaire style rings are still going strong,” Thomas notes, pointing to chunky engagement rings stacked with a bold band. Kahane adds: “The more gold, the better.” DashDividers_1_500x100 2025 Engagement Ring Trend: Bezel Settings If you live a very active lifestyle (or are a bit rough with your jewelry), Guo suggests a setting that protects the main stone, like a bezel. Thomas agrees: “I would say people are still most interested in the bezel and the half bezel or scallop as I call it — a slight twist on the classic.” DashDividers_1_500x100 2025 Engagement Ring Trend: Warm Diamonds Bridging the gap between a diamond and a colorful gemstone, “warm diamonds” are one of Bartrum’s top trend predictions for 2025. They have a slight yellow tint (falling in the I-Z range of the diamond color scale) and are commonly referred to as “champagne diamonds.” DashDividers_1_500x100 2025 Engagement Ring Trend: Vintage Settings For a reliably romantic effect, rings with vintage-inspired settings can transform the look of an engagement ring. “Classic prongs are always popular, but I think we’ll see versions of this with a vintage twist like the addition of a Georgian collet setting, or the use of a gemstone or old mine cut stone in a modern setting to add a more romantic feel to the ring,” Kahane says.

Popping into Abercrombie, American Eagle, or the Gap with your best friends and stopping by the food court to nosh on an oversized pretzel after — ah, how we long for those simpler times.  Editorial consultant Lauren Caruso remembers how, growing up in suburban New Jersey, she’d go with her mom to the mall whenever she needed something, where one specific place stood out: “Ann Taylor was one of the first stores where she tried something on and came out of the dressing room to ask me what I thought.” Though the years since have seen the devastation of malls as a physical space, the brands that dominated the fluorescent-lit caverns of capitalism have found a new footing online. First, Abercrombie came back into focus. Then, group chats were full of texts about the new Banana Republic. J.Crew quickly followed suit, under new creative director Olympia Gayot. Now, it’s Ann’s turn. If you’ve walked past an Ann Taylor store — at the mall or otherwise — or come across its feeds, you might notice it looks… a little different. Once a bastion of women’s workwear, it’s re-entered the conversation, among friends and colleagues alike, despite shifts in what dressing for work actually looks like.  “Women want to be pulled together but still comfortable and fashionable wherever they may work,” says Heather Gruccio, the brand’s SVP Merchandising. “So many women are surprised when they see what we look like today.” Caruso was recently one of those women. “It’s obvious that the brand is paying attention to what women want without completely abandoning its core customer,” she says. So much so, that she committed to becoming an official partner of Ann Taylor. Taking a page out of the handbook of successful DTC brands like Reformation and Everlane, Ann Taylor is harnessing the power of influencers like Caruso to serve as a sort of online lookbook, re-introducing shoppers to the brand and the myriad of ways it can be worn. In new stores, digital monitors will feature this content, offering real-time ideas for customers pulling things into a dressing room. In addition to these creators, Ann Taylor has also been dressing celebrities like Katie Holmes, Viola Davis, and Drew Barrymore, who, while in their 40s and 50s, have enduring personal style that manages to toe the line between playful and sophisticated. Ann Taylor’s shift began when it was acquired in 2020; now, it’s part of The Knitwell Group, which also includes Loft, Chico’s, and Talbots. Part of its recent success, though, has been the brand’s ability to lean into its original DNA, doubling down on workwear even as women log on from home or shift the way they dress for the office. It’s continued to embrace classic corporate silhouettes — trousers with matching blazers, slim-fit cardigans, button-down shirts — in high-quality materials, all while keeping the prices affordable. (Apparel ranges from $20 to $348, with most pieces available in sizes XXS-XXL and 00-22.)  “While there are many great smaller brands customers can discover and shop, there’s equity and trust built up over time of many of the ‘mall brands’ that women have grown to know and love,” Gruccio explains. “We have 70 years of heritage to work with. We know how to make incredible sportswear separates, but I also think you know an Ann print when you see a woman walking down the street in one.” For those going through major moments in their professional lives — starting a new job, returning from maternity leave, or even just stepping back into the office after a minute — there’s a certain comfort in knowing exactly what you’re getting when you’re shopping at Ann Taylor. At the same time, with the growing popularity of tailored workwear, neutral hues, and a buttoned-up sophistication in the wake of the “quiet luxury” trend, there’s a certain flattening of the style curve, making it tough to differentiate between brands that all seem to be reaching towards the same greige blazers. Ann Taylor is breaking through that by offering those wardrobe essentials, but embracing its design roots in florals and flouncy details. As perhaps you’d expect, the brand’s new arrivals page offers a mix of preppy separates, like a cropped polo ($85) or paisley jacket ($198) alongside classic workwear pieces like a plaid trouser ($139) or shift dress ($159). There are mini skirts and tanks, but, in general, Ann Taylor plays to a slightly older, more conservatively dressed audience. That doesn’t mean there isn’t something for Gen Z to tap into: A brand that’s trend-aware without being overtly trendy serves as a great place to pull together the building blocks of a more put-together wardrobe. In fact, it may be more of a generational phenomenon that shoppers discover when the time comes to invest in a work uniform of their own.  “When I started looking for my first big girl job in 2008, I couldn’t really afford much, so I went vintage shopping and found a vintage Ann Taylor blazer that I wore to the interview and my first day,” says Caruso. Now, a new era of corporate girlies are shopping — whether they find out about the brand through influencers, friends, or a parent.  The word cool often gets thrown around in the context of many modern brands — that to be successful, there has to be a certain je ne sais quoi that generates buzz and convinces people to get on board. Ann Taylor seems to have found a workaround: Chasing cool is an impossible task, but staying true to what women want with good quality, affordable pricing, and clothes that make them feel great when they put them on is enough to keep shoppers coming back, no chasing needed. That seems plenty cool to me.  Like what you see?

    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Marisa Petrarca I've never had the pleasure of living somewhere warm, so I've subsequently mastered the art of staying cozy. My go-to for braving Midwest winters is the Aritzia Super Puff, which I almost always pair with my Bombas wool calf socks, and trusty Timberland boots. While I previously thought I had the whole equation figured out, I recently got wind of a genius innovation I wish I had known about sooner: fleece-lined leggings. Intrigued, I did some research and scooped up the bestselling Baleaf Women's Fleece Lined Leggings ($29, originally $38) to test their effectiveness against the brutal Minnesota cold. Turns out, they're exactly what I needed to transform my winter wardrobe, and they're currently discounted. Ahead, I break down everything you need to know about these fleece-lined leggings from Amazon. What I Love About the Baleaf Fleece-Lined Leggings What I love about these fleece-lined leggings is that they're much warmer than my usual go-tos from Old Navy or Lululemon, yet they're equally stretchy and soft. The fleece interior doesn't make me sweat when I wear them inside (and I run warm!), but keeps my legs shielded from the piercing cold when the temperature is only in the teens. Given the fact that these leggings are fleece-lined, I don't think I'll be reaching for these for indoor workouts. However, I can confirm their thick fabric has you covered during exercises like squats, so you don't have to worry about them being see-through at the gym. And even with their added layer, they're plenty flexible for easy movement, with what I'd describe as medium compression. What's even more remarkable is their sleek design. Despite the addition of the soft fleece interior layer, they look just like \"normal\" leggings. Plus, they have two deep pockets, one on each side, that are large enough to fit my iPhone 14 Pro. There's also a zippered pocket on the back waistband for a key, license, or credit card. What's Worth Noting About the Baleaf Fleece-Lined Leggings My sole grievance with the Baleaf Fleece-Lined Leggings is the slight roominess in the groin area. Although this hasn't kept me from wearing them, I'd prefer a more snug fit in this area to prevent any sagging and make them look a bit more flattering. It's worth noting that I'm not alone in this observation; several other customers have also pointed out this detail in their reviews. Another caveat to consider before you buy them is that not everyone thinks they're well-suited for the cold. While they work for me and are certainly a much warmer option than the rest of my leggings, one person, who rated them three stars, left the following review: \"Ordered these for an upcoming trip to Iceland, they are super comfy \u0026 fit well however they are not that warm. Wore them today in 30-degree weather \u0026 I was still cold.\" You might have to test them yourself to determine if they'll be warm enough for you. Who Are the Baleaf Fleece-Lined Leggings Best For? The Baleaf Fleece-Lined Leggings are best for people who love wearing leggings year-round, but are in need of a more heavy-duty pair for when temperatures plummet. They're cozy, yet sleek, proving you don't have to compromise on style for warmth. Not to mention, they prioritize practicality with two types of pockets to store all your small, on-person essentials. Where Are the Baleaf Fleece-Lined Leggings Available? The Baleaf Fleece-Lined Leggings are available via Amazon or direct-to-consumer from the brand's website, baleaf.com. Additional Details About the Baleaf Fleece-Lined Leggings The Baleaf Fleece-Lined Leggings come in sizes X-Small to 3X-Large. They come in several colors to suit every style. They're made of 87 percent polyester and 13 percent spandex. They come in a petite version and a classic version.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/orolay-thickened-long-down-jacket-review-49403809",
    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Kyley Warren Before my recent trip to Iceland, I had to complete one very important task: find a warm jacket comfortable enough for braving the country's often-freezing temperatures. I knew I'd be spending a decent amount of time outdoors in the thick of Reykavik's otherworldly (and notoriously unpredictable) climate, which meant that I'd require an all-weather coat that could handle the unexpected: heavy water exposure underneath waterfalls, wind spells along the country's black sand beaches, and even late-night temperature drops while chasing the Northern Lights. After searching through countless reviews online and sourcing recommendations from friends, I landed (unsurprisingly) on Orolay as the coat brand to entrust with my purchase. The label is known for creating some of the warmest and most durable outerwear on the market, with its famous Thickened Down Jacket amassing over 28,000 ratings on Amazon alone. I decided to try out that style's longer counterpart, the Orolay Thickened Long Down Jacket ($80, originally $150), and can honestly say that in all my years of shopping, I've never found a warmer coat - which is a real testimony, considering I'm known to don multiple layers the moment it drops below 60 degrees. And it's on sale for almost 50% right now. From its packable design (perfect for stuffing into personal carry-ons) to its dopamine-inducing color, I break down what makes this Amazon coat such a worthwhile investment - whether you're wearing it near the Arctic Circle or just in your own backyard. Keep reading for my full Orolay jacket review. What I Like About This Orolay Coat These days, I'm focused more on limiting unnecessary splurges and investing in multifunctional pieces that can work for a variety of occasions and weather conditions. This Orolay jacket ticks all of my boxes and then some; it's crafted from a polyester material that's windproof and waterproof, with an extra-large, adjustable hood that helps to keep my face protected in harsher temperatures. The thickened jacket is filled with 90 percent duck down and 10 percent duck feather, with an insulated design that - per Orolay's website - is suitable for temperatures as low as negative 10 degrees Fahrenheit. The temperatures on my Iceland trip ranged from 25 degrees Fahrenheit to about 45 degrees Fahrenheit, depending on the time of day, and I hardly noticed any temp changes or intense winds because of the comfortability provided by this coat. It's also fitted with unique design flourishes that make it incredibly practical for all-day wear. The coat is completely packable, so it's easy to fold down and squeeze into suitcases or duffel bags without taking up a ton of extra space - despite its thickened down design. The side zipper pockets are remarkably deep and lined with a plush material for extra warmth. I was able to fit everything from a small travel water bottle to a packable umbrella into the pockets, often removing the need for a purse entirely. I also appreciate the style's two-way zipper and button accents, which made it easy to take the jacket on and off whenever going indoors to my hotel or a restaurant. As a fashion girlie through and through, I'm also obsessed with the sunny yellow color of this jacket. The shade is a bit outside of my comfort zone, considering I usually lean heavy into neutrals and more understated tones. But winter can be notoriously gloomy, which is why I decided to opt for something brighter and more mood-boosting. Even if the pastel yellow shade isn't your taste, the waterproof coat is also available in three other colors, including black and white colorways (which I plan to purchase, too). What's Worth Noting My one and only qualm with this long jacket is its pockets, which - despite being deep and offering plenty of carrying space - are situated slightly higher on the coat than other styles, thus creating a somewhat awkward fit when it comes to hand placement. This can be attributed to the depth of the pockets; because they boast a deeper interior that extends farther down, it makes sense to have them situated above the hips as opposed to being front and center on the waistline. I think the pockets are designed more for functionality and are great for holding larger items in a protected (read: zippered) space, especially with products like a smartphone, passport holder, tissues, or even a packable umbrella. But if you're looking for an option that you can comfortably place your hands into whenever they need respite from outside temperatures, I'd recommend shopping for another winter coat. @kyley_warren “You” being my trusty Columbia boots, which have supported me through all of my best adventures.

If you're looking for a practical, stylish, and long-lasting jacket that you can trust will be a wardrobe staple for years to come, you can't go wrong with this Orolay jacket. It's designed with all types of travelers and environments in mind, with a fit that's flattering for all body types. I love that it combines the benefits of a windbreaker, rain coat, and winter jacket all into one multifunctional style, while still boasting a relatively accessible price tag. Additional Details: This Orolay down jacket is available to shop in US women's sizes XS-XXL. It comes in four unique colorways including red, spectra yellow (my shade of choice), white, and pirate black. The winter coat is made from a waterproof polyester material with a fill of 90 percent duck down and 10 percent duck feather. Where Is This Orolay Coat Available to Shop?
