See SJP for Sarah Jessica Parker, ALT for the fashion editor André Leon Talley and – particularly relevant right now – CBK for Carolyn Bessette Kennedy.The wife of John F Kennedy Jr who died in a plane crash in 1999 is sometimes seen as America’s answer to Diana, Princess of Wales. Like Diana, she was loved for her style – called minimalist, chic or “quiet luxury”. Instagram is full of accounts posting archive images of her, influential brands such as The Row, Toteme and Gabriela Hearst design clothes that channel her approach to dressing and there have been books and auctions in recent years.

    "description": "Your eyes are precious, so it’s important to keep ‘em as healthy and stylish as possible. On those supremely bright and sunny days, that means putting on a pair of trendy sunglasses to protect your delicate pupils from harmful UV rays, glare, dust — or paparazzi flashes when out with your digital camera friend.We know that the world of shaded eyewear can be overwhelming, with sunglasses coming in all sorts of shapes, sizes, and widths. That’s why we put together this mini guide to the best sunglasses to look out for, categorized by style, lens type, and activity — and with options for every budget. Whether you're looking for a pair of statement sunglasses for your next vacation, prescription glasses to give your eyes a rest from contacts, or colorful frames to match your wardrobe, there are plenty of options out there. We've even got you covered with polarized styles, sporty shades, and designs for wider faces. So, if one style doesn’t work for you, we guarantee there’s another pair of sunnies around the corner that will. Now, go forth and keep those rays at bay.All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.The Best Brands For Prescription SunglassesAs any glasses-wearer will know, shopping for a new pair of prescription sunglasses is a major decision. Not only are you committing to a pair of frames if and until your prescription changes, but it’s a choice that will cost you a pretty penny. This is why we’re such fans of Pair Eyewear, a brand all about choice and customization at affordable prices. You can choose from a variety of prescription frames — prices starting at $60 — and select from hundreds of customizable “tops”; aka magnetic, flat frames that cover the front of your glasses to instantly change their appearance. This means that using the same stylish frame as a base, you can switch seamlessly between eyeglasses and sunglasses, or between different colored and patterned options — ideal for matching your specs to your outfit! (There are also plenty of sunglasses-only options available, too.)If you have a higher budget, there are several other luxury brands always on our rotation: Ace \u0026 Tate, Warby Parker, and Cubitts offer chic, stylish frames within the $200 to $300 price range.Pair Eyewear The Payton, $, available at Pair EyewearWarby Parker Lupin, $, available at Warby ParkerCubitts Grimaldi, $, available at Cubittsace \u0026 tate Selma, $, available at ace \u0026 tateThe Best Brands For Polarized SunglassHeard of polarized sunglasses but are not sure of their benefits? Polarized shades are especially crucial if you're an outdoorsy, under-the-sun person.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/taylor-swift-reformation-corset-top-49448397",
    "description": "Image Source: Getty Images | Gotham Image Source: Reformation Taylor Swift is just a girl like the rest of us - and like any true fashion lover, she's got a thing for corset tops. Honestly, who can blame her? They cinch you in all the right places, add a flirty touch, and somehow make even the simplest outfit look totally put together. Whether you're pairing one with jeans, leather pants, a skirt, or shorts, they just work. Case in point: Swift's latest date night look with boyfriend Travis Kelce featured a soft blue corset from Reformation - the Seren Top ($168). And surprise, surprise - it's still in stock. We were kind of shocked too, since most things she wears sell out in seconds. The fact that this piece is still available feels like a minor miracle. Priced under $200, it's a no-brainer - cute, stylish, and perfect for summer nights. If it's good enough for Taylor Swift's date night, it's definitely good enough for ours. We're adding one to our cart ASAP, and if you're a Swift fan, this one's definitely worth it for you, too. What Is the Reformation Seren Top? Taylor Swift wore the cornflower shade of Reformation's Seren Top for a date night out with boyfriend Travis Kelce in NYC. The top is still available in all four colors on Reformation's website, so you can take your pick. It's designed to fit snugly and is made from a heavyweight crepe fabric that's thick enough to hold its shape, giving it that polished, structured look you want from a corset-style top. The fabric is mostly made from Naia Renew acetate (fancy talk for a sustainable material that comes from wood pulp), mixed with some polyester to make it tougher and last longer. It feels crisp and smooth - not super soft or silky - which helps maintain that clean, sharp look when you wear it. If you're not too focused on the eco-friendly aspect, there's a similar option on Amazon: the Lizynuty Crop Top ($13). It nails the same look, but is made from 100 percent polyester, so it's less green and can feel a bit less comfy on your skin. Definitely not the same quality, but hey - options are always nice, right?",

    "description": "Plenty of \"And Just Like That\" spoilers are lurking below, FYI. You can't tell the story of \"Sex and the City\" and its revival/sequel \"And Just Like That\" without spending an inordinate amount of time discussing the fashion. Over the course of the original show's six seasons, Carrie Bradshaw became a universal style icon. She inspired generations of women to waltz around New York City in tulle dresses, all while carefully dodging potholes in their Manolo Blahnik pumps. Styled by the inimitable Patricia Field, Bradshaw (played by Sarah Jessica Parker) delighted in getting dressed. Her style was quirky, vibrant, romantic: she'd stop by McDonald's in a pink Oscar de la Renta frock or go wedding-dress shopping with a belt tied around her bare stomach. Throughout the series, as well as in the three \"Sex and the City\" movies that followed, Field and Parker set trends, launched design careers into the stratosphere, and created an endless stream of iconic looks. Now, the \"And Just Like That\" outfits aim to carry on that legacy. Image Source: HBO [Carrie Bradshaw] inspired generations of women to waltz around New York City in tulle dresses, all while carefully dodging potholes in their Manolo Blahnik pumps. With costume designers Molly Rogers and Danny Santiago on board, Carrie still enjoys fashion on \"And Just Like That,\" but the writers also use it as a mechanism to communicate her state of mind. When she wore a tulle skirt and black headpiece to Big's funeral in season one, it was to make her late husband proud. Later, as she started to date and feel like herself again, she was back in a Norma Kamali ruched blue dress that fit impeccably well; it's so quintessentially her that fans dubbed it the \"Carrie dress.\" Likewise, in season three, she steps out in a quirky Strawberry Shortcake-style hat that has the internet divided, much like that time she almost got married with a bird on her head. The message? Bradshaw is officially back and in her element (we hope). Image Source: HBO Fashion is obviously sacred to Bradshaw, but other characters have memorable style moments as well. Miranda Hobbes's colorful halter dress and Seema Patel's leopard look from season one could've been right at home in the original series. In season two, the characters dressed up to attend the fictitious, \"Veiled Beauty\"-themed Met Gala: Lisa Todd Wexley in a breathtaking red Valentino gown and Charlotte York Goldenblatt in a bold corset top and skirt. At times, their looks carry a greater significance. Think of Rock Goldenblatt's unconventional styling of their Oscar de la Renta dress as they prepared to share their gender identity with their parents in season one. Or Miranda's uncharacteristically sexy halter jumpsuit as she stepped outside a stale marriage to flirt with Che Diaz at the bar. In season three, Patel's impossibly chic white fringe dress proved she had no business scouting movie locations all day while Todd Wexley's quirky, oversize ball necklace is a nod to her penchant for thinking outside-the-box, a trait that clashes with her unimaginative documentary producers. Ahead, check out the best \"And Just Like That\" outfits so far - and shop the best fashion from season three.",
