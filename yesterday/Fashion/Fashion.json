    "description": "From voters picking up ‘bad vibes’ to the Brat girl summer, vague instincts now make the world go round. Does this represent a crisis of seriousness or has it always been feelings that make us human? Facts were cool for about 250 years. From the Enlightenment until this century, facts were where it was at. They had a good innings. But it is game over for facts, the end of the line for statistics. These days, what counts is what you feel. In other words, it’s all about the vibe.Vibes are everywhere. Disillusioned Labour voters are “picking up bad vibes”, reports this paper. The Bank of England gets “wrong-footed by a vibe shift in the economy”. In the US, a “vibe-cession” – a downturn in economic confidence at an impressionistic level – was a key electoral issue. Google Maps will not only give you directions, but “vibe check” a neighbourhood for you. Of all this year’s hit albums, the one that had a vibe named after it – Brat – won the culture, catapulting Charli XCX to seven Grammy nominations. When a new production of Romeo \u0026 Juliet opened on Broadway recently, a US newspaper wrote that “the vibe is very ‘teens hanging out in the Target parking lot’, only with a lot more sonnets and glitter” – because even William Shakespeare is no one without a vibe these days.

Those little hero items that come to the rescue should sartorial disaster strike. We all know how one accidental splosh of red wine can ruin a look, after all.To give us a helping hand on a night out, we’ve asked a bunch of fashionable people who always look well put together to share the secret weapon in their handbag. For some, it is about the basics but essentials: a sewing kit (photographer and model Laura Bailey’s must-have), a toothpick or elastic bands (stylist Peter Bevan explains how they are key to achieving the perfect rolled-up shirt sleeve). For others, it’s a proper piece of kit, such as a debobbler, a defuzzer or an on-the-go tailoring tool. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/bestselling-skims-products-49378788",
    "description": "Skims went from an idea to an award-winning intimates and loungewear brand. Founded by Kim Kardashian and Jens Grede in 2019, the company was valued at $4 billion in July 2023, according to Forbes. Whether or not shoppers are Kardashian fans, the brand still seems to have go-to collections that continuously sell out. And its Fifth Avenue flagship store was unveiled in NYC on Dec. 12 (right on the heels of its five-year anniversary) with a special presentation and celeb-packed party. The Skims Fits Everybody line is made with a signature stretch fabric that truly is butter-soft (in fact, I'm wearing the classic thong right now and I describe it as feeling like \"nothing.\" In other words, it's a second skin). The Soft Lounge launch gave way to everyone's favorite long slip dress, which most people attest to be the most flattering body-conscious piece they own. And the Seamless Sculpt range provides every piece of shapewear you could possibly imagine layering underneath that slightly skin-revealing look you've been trying to figure out how to style. And then there's the nipple push-up bra that turns heads whenever I wear it and is a major bestseller. It should come as no surprise that you can now shop these pieces in person. Of course, Skims has been most notably praised for its sizing (XXS-4X) and incredible assortment of nude shades to complement skin tones. Its adaptive products feature added hook and eye closures and front clasps for accessibility, though the brand is overdue for introducing more styles. Nevertheless, if you're new to shopping Skims, we highly recommend you start with the top-rated picks that most folks rave about on social - and these 12 are it. Ahead, read up on the Skims bestsellers, and decide where to shop based on your color and size preferences. Skims is available online at skims.com, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Net-a-Porter, Ssense, and more.",
