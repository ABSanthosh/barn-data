    "description": "Social media will tell you that all millennials dress one way to work out, while gen Z dresses another. The truth is more complex and far more interestingAround me, a group of women in skintight gym sets are side planking. Some are wearing full-coverage unitards, others leave slices of midriff bare. No one is wearing a baggy T-shirt from 2008 with a naked Rufus Wainwright on it, and hardened flecks of damp-proof paint. Except me.If TikTok is to be believed, my gym-mates must be millennials, born between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s; gen Z would find such skin-tightness a bit retro, or basic, or even “jurassic fitness”. Another generational schism has opened online – to add to socks, jeans and boundaries – this time over what millennials and gen Z are wearing to work out in. Tight-on-tight outfits supposedly single you out as a millennial – it is “giving middle school”, said one gen Z user witheringly – while gen Z prefers something baggier. Looking around me at pilates and in the park, though, I suspect some of the women wearing a second, seal-like skin are younger than 30. And here I am, days after turning 40 – squarely a millennial – wearing an enormous T-shirt. It is a muddled picture. Continue reading...",

Sweat sets are an MVP for curling up on chilly flights. Bonus: You can break up a set and wear each piece separately, unlocking endless mix-and-match potential for those moments when you actually want to plan an outfit.If you’re ready to retire those ratty, holey sweats that have seen you through college and countless days under your duvet (no judgment — we’ve all got that pair), consider yourself covered.

And those with tight spiral curls eye the straight-haired with envy. But between the two, there’s natural waves.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/bandage-dress-trend-49446365",
    "description": "As complex as the trend cycle may seem, it's not all that hard to understand. Most trends are just reimagined versions of styles we've seen before. (See: TikTok's diaper shorts, which are really just a modern take on 1800s bloomers.) Brands depend on innovative design treatments or collaborations for many of these trends to land successfully, but the No. 1 thing that makes them impossible to resist? A celebrity cosign. Similar to cutouts and jorts, another style has regained popularity amongst the stars: bandage dresses. While tons of celebrities have rocked the silhouette throughout the years, Hailey Bieber and Kaia Gerber's recent embrace of the trend is especially referential. Gerber wore a bandage dress from Hervé Léger at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival, while Bieber wore a burgundy Saint Laurent iteration at this year's Fashion Trust U.S. Awards - both showcasing the style's relevance. What Are Bandage Dresses? Bandage dresses have been around long before TikTok had a say in what's trending. The silhouette took off in the early '90s, when Léger helped popularize the look with elastic detailing, draped necklines, and tightly fitted bodices. You can think of the bandage dress as the original bodycon dress that represented class, glamour, and confidence for the wearer. The iconic fashion label gained recognition for this innovation in womenswear, with stars like Cindy Crawford, Rihanna, and Kim Kardashian wearing the style on and off the runway. Today, bandage dresses have evolved in many forms, from mini and maxi lengths to bandeau and halter styles. Whether you're hunting for the right figure-flattering piece or looking for your next date-night dress, we've curated the ultimate guide to bandage dresses for every shape and occasion. From affordable picks from our favorite retailers like Nordstrom to splurge-worthy designer picks (including a rare Léger find), shop the best bandage dresses to wear this summer and beyond.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/best-cowboy-boots-for-women-47246567",
    "description": "In our opinion, boots are a great footwear option year-round. We love that we can wear them with everything from jeans to skirts to shorts and even jorts -even in the summer, when it's blisteringly hot, having a closed toed shoe at a concert, bar, or event can be a lifesaver. While the Western-inspired boot has been popular for some time now, this season, we're going full cowboy boots, and we couldn't be more excited about it. These boots are statement-making yet surprisingly wearable, and frankly, they'll make you feel like a badass. Because there are a lot of options out there, we've narrowed it down to these 12 top pairs of cowboy boots. These are our favorites on the market; some are short, some are tall, some are neutral, and some are printed, but they're all going to add a cool touch to any look. We're eyeing a black cowboy boot we can wear everywhere, a pink cowboy boot that's fun and whimsical, and a white cowboy boot that we can wear all summer long. We're already dreaming of all the outfits we can create with these fun boots (hello, Cowboy Carter). Just keep reading to shop our picks!",
