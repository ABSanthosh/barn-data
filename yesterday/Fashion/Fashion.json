    "description": "From bucket hats to Man City socks and the band’s logo everywhere, gig-goers in Cardiff talk us through their outfits – and explain why Liam is still a style icon, even with shorter hairIn the weeks leading up to their first gig for 16 years, Oasis have been busy when it comes to merch. They opened pop-up shops and announced collabs with Levi’s, Adidas and Next. The results are plain to see on the streets of Cardiff the afternoon before the long-awaited gig. If they say you are never more than six feet away from a rat in a city, here you are never more than six inches away from that famous Oasis Helvetica Black Oblique logo.It’s on bucket hats, football shirts, tracksuit tops, T-shirts and, every so often, someone’s face. The fanbase goes across generations and demographics. There are those who were there the first time, and teenagers who grew up on their music. Some have travelled for miles – from Italy, Spain, Portugal and the US. If the crowd is largely white, there’s a contingent of fans from east Asia.From left: Ash Parker, Marcus Long and Joe Gallagher in their brand new T-shirts Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ariana-madix-love-island-usa-fashion-season-7?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "It can feel like there aren’t enough hours in the day to dissect every single morsel coming out of the Villa on season seven of Love Island USA, airing on Peacock right now. (I personally dedicate more than I’d like to admit to this.) There’s also not much that the growing (and growingly divided) audience universally agrees on — except the fact that Ariana Madix looks amazing, whether it’s in a molten bronze maxi with a Rapunzel-worthy braid, in a hot pink LaQuan Smith cut-out dress, or in a red latex mini as her newly-discovered brunette alter ego.  The reality TV star and Love Island superfan has leveled up her fashion for her sophomore season as host. Her secret weapon? Content creator and stylist Emily Men, whom Madix has been working with since season 10 of Vanderpump Rules. (Fun fact: They connected through fellow Bravo star Lindsay Hubbard.) Having already collaborated on Love Island looks last summer, they didn’t feel the pressure to one-up themselves fashion-wise, even with all the attention the show’s gotten since season six. “That being said,” Madix says, “I definitely feel like we’ve still somehow managed to [bring] it.”  LOVE ISLAND USA — Episode 706 — Pictured: Ariana Madix — (Photo by: Kim Nunneley/Peacock) Men describes herself as “very go-with-the-flow,” and she wasn’t particularly concerned with people’s expectations. “Working from last season to this season, I didn’t change anything because my philosophy is: Whether it’s Love Island, a press thing, whatever, just pull what’s best out there,” she says. “Whenever I’m looking and sourcing, it’s always what looks the best. I’m not super strategic with it.” The main difference between seasons six and seven, Men adds, is that she and Madix started sending each other ideas during the off-season, compiling a folder of inspiration that served as a starting point for the wardrobe. “We want to have an element of surprise, which I think we do execute, but it’s still Love Island,” she notes. “It’s still tropical, so the obvious things come to mind.” “I was saving a lot of crochet, a lot of very mermaid looks,” Madix says, “some muted dusty pinks and blues.” LOVE ISLAND USA — “Aftersun” Episode 705 — Pictured: Ariana Madix — (Photo by: Ben Symons/Peacock) LOVE ISLAND USA — Episode 712 — Pictured: Ariana Madix — (Photo by: Ben Symons/Peacock) As a Love Island connoisseur, Madix is quite familiar with the sartorial language of the show, which influences how she dresses as the host. “It doesn’t have to always be bright colors, but it’s got to be something,” she says. “It can’t just be a nice dress. It always has an element — if it’s a pink dress, it’s a pink dress with my whole stomach cut out and my whole back out; if it’s going to be a darker color, it’s going to look like I just came from outer space…. Everything is a look.” If she were to sum up her Love Island wardrobe, it would come down to: “Strong looks, bright colors, and sexy. Always sexy. I come to Fiji with pounds of boob inserts.”  While the two are very in tune on the types of looks they want, the show’s production schedule presents logistical challenges. For one, the clothes need to be in Fiji for the duration of filming, from the beginning of June through mid-July. “It can be a bit of a struggle to narrow down what’s available [for that long] and what [we can] get our hands on,” Madix says. “You think, ‘Oh yeah, host of Love Island, all these cool outfits, everyone’s just giving things’ — it’s not as easy. So many of those fashion houses are like, ‘Oh, it’s a reality show? No.’”  “I come to Fiji with pounds of boob inserts.” Ariana Madix Two months is a long time to cede a sample, but this is a production that has continuously broken viewership records, with Peacock reporting that 39% of those tuning in are new to the show — especially after season six, which was so successful and beloved, its cast members are getting a spin-off. You can’t log onto any social media platform “every day but hump day” without seeing posts about what the current Islanders are up to (and the audience’s assessment of the drama unfolding onscreen).   LOVE ISLAND USA — Episode 719 — Pictured: Ariana Madix — (Photo by: Ben Symons/Peacock) LOVE ISLAND USA — Episode 722 — Pictured: Ariana Madix — (Photo by: Ben Symons/Peacock) Madix’s wardrobe ends up being a mix of pieces Men borrows from showrooms, is gifted, thrifts, or finds online. “The colorful rainbow disc one — that one was from a small business that I found on Etsy,” she says.  They’ll have a fitting about a week or two before Madix heads out to Fiji. Men will then tailor everything to Madix’s measurements and do a second fitting to make sure everything’s good. “Once we decide that these are the looks, I’ll start to accessorize — shoes, jewelry,” Men continues. “Then I send off a PDF of all the looks. Some things change, because sometimes I’m not able to try on rings and that kind of stuff, but I [map it out] as best as I can. It’ll even show ‘right hand, left hand, helix piercing, whatever side faces the camera more.’” She’s not in Fiji with Madix, so those in-real-time adjustments are at the hands of Emily Abbey and Karissa Loveday, the on-set wardrobe team that gets her ready for filming; though they’re all on a WhatsApp group together, where they’ll send pictures, chime in on changes, and communicate what’s happening in real time.  For her part, Madix will keep all her options on a rack, so she can remain flexible and make game-time decisions. “Let’s say there are 10 more times I’m going to be going in — ‘Okay, well, we don’t want two gold [looks] next to each other.’ We try to stagger everything,” she says. “Sometimes we think, ‘This might be good for [Love Island:] Aftersun. Oh, but we wanted to have a moment. Is this now going to be a game [look]? Is it a daytime thing?’ We’re changing in real time sometimes.”  LOVE ISLAND USA — “Villa Tour” — Pictured: Ariana Madix — (Photo by: Ben Symons/PEACOCK) LOVE ISLAND USA — Pictured: Ariana Madix — (Photo by: Ben Symons/Peacock) She also thinks about why she’s going inside the Villa. “Night one, we go sparkly — something that feels sexy but also fun and celebratory,” Madix explains. “When I came in this season for America’s Vote, when Charlie got dumped, I was very much leaning into, ‘I know someone’s going home tonight, I’m coming in delivering America’s Vote, and it’s going to be intense.’ Then Casa Amor Recoupling, it was sexy, but also I wanted to feel kind of dangerous, because it’s one of those nights that can go many different directions, but usually is pretty intense. When I came in to introduce Casa Amor, it’s like, ‘This is a daytime look. I want it to be bright. I want it to be fun. I’m having fun with them. No one’s going home.’” Another very real consideration for Madix: “Sometimes I’m in my luteal phase, so I don’t want to wear a certain outfit — I’m here long enough to be on two periods. That type of stuff affects [outfit decisions] as well.”  “To casually wear a ball gag as a necklace — chef’s kiss.”Ariana Madix This season, Madix and Men have been able to call upon friends, like L.A.-based designer and seamstress Taylor Cox, who made her custom beaded crystal mesh gown for night one. They’ve also had a lot of fun experimenting with new looks, like Madix’s “Leather and Lace” party ensemble. “I had two options for that night, one of which was a black lace bodysuit with a black leather corset, harnesses, and bunny ears. But then we tried on the red dress and the coat, and Emily found some amazing accessories online,” Madix says. “I thought, ‘Wow, to casually wear a ball gag as a necklace — chef’s kiss.’” “I was just ordering random stuff,” Men admits. “It was funny because a lot of people didn’t catch it, but then a lot of people did. It was just something subtle.” LOVE ISLAND USA — Episode 709 — Pictured: Ariana Madix — (Photo by: Ben Symons/Peacock) LOVE ISLAND USA — Episode 701 — Pictured: Ariana Madix — (Photo by: Ben Symons/Peacock) The duo also gives props to the hair and makeup team, Carl Cambridge and Krystal Dawn, the former being responsible for Madix’s brunette locks for the “Leather and Lace” party. “You need all the components,” Men says. “You need all the elements for it all to go together. So it’s amazing that we’re able to form this great team.”  Madix and Men still have a few tricks up their sleeves for what remains of the season. “There are a couple of things that are pretty epic that I hope we have a moment for,” Madix teases, adding that there’s a hard-shell top moment she’s excited to wear. “Love Island is fun because there are so many looks in one show,” Men notes. “[There are] so many different moods and so many different types of styles. We love to mix and match. Some people take fashion too seriously, but, at the end of the day, it’s fun, and you should be able to wear all the things you want to wear.” “Now,” Madix says, “we got to think about, ‘Well, where do we go from here?’” Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/work-outfit-ideas-spring-summer?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Ever stand in front of your jam-packed closet, staring at more than enough clothing options, and think: I have nothing to wear? Same. But perhaps the issue isn’t that you’re out of viable outfit choices. You just need a fresh dose of inspiration — say: summer work outfits — to help you see your wardrobe in a new way. That’s where Outfit Dump comes in. We supply you with enough ideas to fuel your style until the next drop comes along. Getting dressed every day — for work, in particular — can be a chore. Fashion decision fatigue can make it feel like you have nothing to wear, when really your style inspiration has just run dry, especially in the summer, when the steaming-hot temperatures don’t care about your office dress code. But the solution doesn’t have to be stuffing shopping bags (or virtual carts) full of new clothes (though adding a few thoughtfully selected items might not hurt); instead, you just have to try to style your existing wardrobe in fun and creative ways. Thankfully, there’s plenty of inspiration to be found on our Instagram feeds, which are full of the hottest summer trends — think: polka dot patterns, boho silhouettes, and sporty styles — and fashion staples, like oversized blazers and crisp button-front shirts. Ahead, find 20 summer-ready outfits that you can wear to the office and beyond.Summer Work Outfit Idea: Matching Set Because there’s more to matching sets than coordinating loungewear and tailored suits. Seek out a set in luxe, heat-friendly materials, like the textured two-piece seen here, for a low-effort, put-together look.Summer Work Outfit Idea: Skirt SetIf pants are not your summer vibe, make skirt sets your best friend. Layer wisely so you can adapt your outfit for the office and happy hour drinks that evening. Summer Work Outfit Idea: Wide-Leg JeansIf your office is casual enough, make your go-to work uniform a breezy button-up and pair of wide-leg jeans. It’s a timeless, confidence-boosting outfit that also creates some breathing room. Summer Work Outfit Idea: CulottesJeans a no-go at your workplace? Make a statement with a pair of flowy culottes instead. Summer Work Outfit Idea: Polka DotsIt’s not often that a current fashion trend can be worn in most workplaces, but polka-dot patterns are the exception to that unwritten rule. Why not get a little playful at the office for once?Summer Work Outfit Idea: Drop-Waist DressBring your European summer dreams to work with you with a cute drop-waist dress. Throw a blazer over it if you would like more coverage for the office setting (or that AC).Summer Work Outfit Idea:  Blouse + Maxi Skirt When it comes to getting dressed for both work and summer temperatures, you can’t go wrong with a blouse and maxi skirt. We love the floral pattern on the vintage piece pictured here.Summer Work Outfit Idea: Oversized Blazer + Skirt      Lean into your preppy side with a classic skirt suit (necktie optional), but add cool factor with an oversized blazer. We love how dynamic the extra-long sleeves seen here are.Spring Work Outfit Idea: Two-Tone Blazer Have the kind of job where wearing a blazer is a must? Bring more variety to your look and make things more interesting by opting for a two-tone option instead. Spring Work Outfit Idea: Two-Tone Suit Or go the extra mile and make your entire office-ready matching set two-tone.Summer Work Outfit Idea: Cropped Blazer Your 9-to-5 will go from blah to cool with a cropped blazer adding just enough businesscore edge.Summer Work Outfit Idea: Denim Midi Skirt Because denim is definitely more dressed up and work-appropriate when it comes in the form of a midi skirt, right? Swap out the sweater seen here for a lighter layer, and you’re summer-ready. Spring Work Outfit Idea: Dressed Up Patchwork Denim You can even take it a step further and push office-attire boundaries with a trendy patchwork denim set or dress. Bonus points for the equally on-trend colored tights and matching shoes. Spring Work Outfit Idea: Black + White It’s hard to go wrong with a classic black-and-white look — we love the shade contrast between the outfit and accessories in this Paris street style look.Summer Work Outfit Idea: Trench Coat Because any outfit feels a tad more sophisticated when topped up with a trench coat — an essential warm-weather layer for rainy days. Keep your commute casual by adding your favourite baseball cap, like seen here. Summer Work Outfit Idea: Dress + Collared Top Style your go-to workwear dress by layering it over a lightweight top with a statement collar. It’s a simple way to make a tried-and-true piece feel new again.Summer Work Outfit Idea: Waistcoat Vests and waistcoats are continuing their dominance into this summer, and, luckily, this is a trend that makes perfect sense in an office setting.Spring Work Outfit Idea: Sweater Vest If a structured waistcoat feels a bit too stuffy for your liking, try putting on a stylish sweater vest over your favorite white button-up.Spring Work Outfit Idea: Touches of Leopard Print The leopard-print trend is, undeniably, harder to incorporate into a work-ready outfit. But if you’re all in on the print, fret not: Sprinkle touches of it into your look — on a collar, a handbag, or even a pair of shoes — and you’re good to go.Spring Work Outfit Idea: Matching Suit Set Picture this: It’s a sunny Monday morning and you want nothing to do with work. Put on a matching suit — in whatever pattern or hue you prefer — and you’ll instantly feel ready for the week ahead, even if you’d rather be on vacation.Summer Work Outfit Idea: Oversized Button-Up Because nothing says “effortlessly chic” like an oversized button-up shirt. Opt for a linen version to stay cool.Summer Work Outfit Idea: Pastel Midi Dress Midi dresses are rightfully a workwear staple. Add some seasonal fun to your wardrobe by opting for one in a pretty pastel hue. Summer Work Outfit Idea: Puffy Sleeves Voluminous sleeves will ensure the only drama you’re creating at the office is through your outfit.Summer Work Outfit Idea: Peplum Top We don’t mean to alarm you, but the early 2010s are calling and telling you that it is indeed time to break out the peplum tops again. Spring Work Outfit Idea: Metallic ShoesWhy not make the shoes the star of your outfit — especially when you have a covetable metallic pair to work with. Summer Work Outfit Idea: Collared Mini Dress This Lauren Chan look is the ideal summer fashion inspo: a warm weather-ready dress and cute ballet flats. Pro-tip: Experiment with the color and pattern of the socks to bring a bigger pop of personality to your outfit. Summer Work Outfit Idea: Tenniscore  If your sense of style leans more sporty-chic, channel the tenniscore aesthetic by throwing a blazer over a court-ready dress. Just switch out the sneakers for a pair of office-friendly shoes. Summer Work Outfit Idea: Floral Jumpsuit Do we really have to say anything more? Spring Work Outfit Idea: Ruffles Because how could you not have a good day while wearing frills and ruffles? Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?Outfit Inspo For Styling A Waistcoat This SeasonFestival Outfit Ideas To Inspire Your Summer StyleTop Spring Clothes \u0026 Accessories For 2024",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/cardi-b-best-outfits-49178336",
    "description": "Cardi B has always understood the assignment. As a first-time attendee at the Met Gala in 2018, she raised the stakes in an ornate Moschino by Jeremy Scott gown embroidered with thousands of pearls and gemstones. In 2019, she became the pearl in a vintage Mugler gown from the designer's fall 1995 collection at the 2019 Grammy Awards. For nearly a decade, Cardi B has been gracing the red carpet with flawless looks, due in large part to the talented eye of her primary stylist, Kollin Carter. As one of the most influential women rappers, Cardi B is decorated with dozens of awards - including a Grammy and seven American Music Awards - and rightfully so. Lyrically, the Bronx-born rapper always gives us her all, delivering unfiltered verses and an ardent passion as she details her past struggles and whirlwind rise to the top. She brings this same unapologetic vibrancy to every head-turning ensemble. From award shows and red carpets to onstage performances, Cardi B's style never misses. She moves seamlessly from a corseted gown to a tweed pantsuit, always embracing dramatic embellishment like pearls, feathers, studs, and more. Sorting through her entire style catalog would take weeks, but as part of POPSUGAR's celebration of women in hip-hop, we rounded up her most memorable outfits ahead. Shop pieces inspired by her style then keep scrolling to see her best looks so far.",
