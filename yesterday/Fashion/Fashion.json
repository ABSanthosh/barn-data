    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/bestselling-skims-products-49378788",
    "description": "Skims went from an idea to an award-winning intimates and loungewear brand. Founded by Kim Kardashian and Jens Grede in 2019, the company was valued at $4 billion in July 2023, according to Forbes. Whether or not shoppers are Kardashian fans, the brand still seems to have go-to collections that continuously sell out. And the latest iteration is \"The Ultimate Butt\" drop featuring shorts, leggings, and bodysuits with built-in butt pads. Almost as soon as Kardashian announced the new collection on Instagram, fans responded with strong opinions, some praising the campaign rollout (\"The marketing is simply genius,\" one commenter wrote) and others questioning how the shapewear will fare IRL (\"and then you take it off to hook up and then what,\" one critic posted). No matter where you fall on the butt-padding debate, you can't ignore the numbers: most of the drop is already sold out. Some other favorites from Skims? The Skims Fits Everybody line is made with a signature stretch fabric that truly is butter-soft (in fact, I'm wearing the classic thong right now and I describe it as feeling like \"nothing.\" In other words, it's a second skin). The Soft Lounge launch gave way to everyone's favorite long slip dress, which most people attest to be the most flattering body-conscious piece they own. And the Seamless Sculpt range provides every piece of shapewear you could possibly imagine layering underneath that slightly skin-revealing look you've been trying to figure out how to style. And then there's the nipple push-up bra that turns heads whenever I wear it and is a major bestseller. It should come as no surprise that you can now shop these pieces in person. Of course, Skims has been most notably praised for its sizing (XXS-4X) and incredible assortment of nude shades to complement skin tones. Its adaptive products feature added hook and eye closures and front clasps for accessibility, though the brand is overdue for introducing more styles. Nevertheless, if you're new to shopping Skims, we highly recommend you start with the top-rated picks that most folks rave about on social - and the below assortment is it. Ahead, read up on the Skims bestsellers, and decide where to shop based on your color and size preferences. Skims is available online at skims.com, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Net-a-Porter, Ssense, and more.",

    "description": "Running for just four days, and with its influencer coverage dwarfed by New York and Paris, LFW needs British soft power and its prized creatives to bring some buzzBeneath the glitter and sequins and extra-long false eyelashes, the bald truth at London fashion week is of an industry overshadowed by the luxury might of Europe and the US. Many designers have closed their doors, or cannot afford to splash out on a show. At just four days long, London fashion week has shrunk to half the duration of the Paris shows.Cash is in short supply, but ambition and creativity are not. At SS Daley, the Harry Styles-backed brand whose trench coats are now sold at John Lewis, the show opened with the sound of Big Ben, included “Stay Faithfull to Marianne” sweaters in tribute to the late British style icon, and closed with a general clamour for selfies with front row guest of honour, the Amandaland actor Lucy Punch. Actor Debi Mazar took the stage for jewellery brand Completedworks, playing a television shopping channel hostess on the verge of a nervous breakdown, hawking the “mermaid realness” of pearl earrings while sipping a martini. At the Tate Modern, Florence Pugh opened Harris Reed’s show with a monologue in praise of “the art of dressing up”. Continue reading...",

Much Ado About Nothing may be more than 400 years old but Jamie Lloyd’s current spin in London’s West End plants it very much in the modern day. Key to its contemporary update? The costumes, which look as if they have been plucked straight from a Hollywood red carpet.Recently, menswear has been leaning into a new fun fashion era. Bland black tuxes are out. In their place? Everything from sheer chiffon shirts to sparkly jewellery. Greta Gerwig’s box office-breaking Barbie film, in which Ryan Gosling leaned into his himbo character Ken on and off-screen, may be approaching its two-year anniversary but its impact is still reverberating in menswear. No one, from the 72-year-old Jeff Goldblum to gen Z’s Timothée Chalamet, can resist. Even at this year’s Bafta awards, usually a more restrained carpet, a dazzling brooch was a menswear staple.

    "description": "Kendrick Lamar’s 2025 Super Bowl halftime show was a big moment for a lot of things — bootcut jeans especially. The rapper’s lightwash Celine pair made many of us fall in love with the silhouette all over again, perhaps for the first time since the early aughts.It was already on our radars as a 2025 denim trend, especially in spring collections. While dramatic flares, baggy cargos, and barrel-leg jeans continue to trend, bootcut jeans present a more subtle option for those of us who want a sleek pair of everyday denim. They’re ideal for fitting over your cowboy boots or pooling around your on-trend clogs — and most don’t have a $1,200 Celine price tag. We found the best women’s bootcut jeans (in a range of standard, petite, tall, and plus sizes) from some of Refinery29 readers’ favorite brands.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. For those who gravitate toward traditional bridal aesthetics, the task of choosing an engagement ring probably feels less daunting. (Classic solitaire diamond — check!) But if you’re undecided on what style best aligns with your personal taste, rest assured there’s never been a better time to be on the market for an engagement ring.  Bespoke designs, antique finds, and modern stones and silhouettes are all on offer thanks to the rise of independent jewelry designers and vintage marketplaces, making a diverse range of ring styles now widely accessible. “Screengrab any rings you like on Instagram, Pinterest, or any other visual platforms you use often, and save those photos as inspiration,” suggests Yi Collection founder Yi Guo, adding that, after a while, you’ll notice a pattern of what you like. From there, begin to take stock of what’s most important to you in an engagement ring.  “Do you want a standout solo stone? Are you intrigued by antique styles? Or maybe into a design that feels a bit more unique? Once you’ve nailed the general vibe of your ideal wedding ring, that can help you narrow in on what appeals to you specifically,” Stone and Strand founder Nadine Kahane says.  Then comes the fun part: Setting up an in-person appointment to try on several options. “Pieces can look very different on, so it’s great to be able to get an idea of what suits you,” designer Jessie Thomas says. If the idea of being involved in the choosing of your ring strips away the excitement, consider tapping your partner for help.  “I’m not opposed to going old-school and letting your partner pick,” says Starling founder Chelsey Bartrum, who had her husband choose her engagement ring. “I would have been way too indecisive and liked everything otherwise.” She does have a word of advice to steer them in the right direction: “Make sure they know a few jewelers you’re drawn to so the style matches you — that way, you’ll know they’re in good hands picking it out.” Ahead, our jewelry experts share their predictions for the engagement ring trends that will shine brightly in 2025, from cuts and settings to metals and gemstones. 2025 Engagement Ring Trend: Three Stones While a standalone gemstone can make a beautiful statement, a multi-stone silhouette is equally striking. “Three-stone engagement rings are gaining in popularity, particularly those that have oversized diamonds and a mix of unique diamond shapes, like a cushion or oval center stone paired with half-moon or pear side stones,” Kahane says. DashDividers_1_500x100 2025 Engagement Ring Trend: Heirloom Cuts Nostalgia continues to drive engagement ring trends, particularly when it comes to diamond cuts. “We’re seeing Asscher and cushion cut stones become more popular, as well as old mine cut stones,” Kahane says. “They feel more special as they’re one of a kind, and the antique stones each come with a unique backstory.” Even when these stones are cut new, she adds, they can still give an engagement ring more of an heirloom feel.  Bartrum notes that we’re also seeing lab-grown diamonds cut in these vintage-style facets. “I think their popularity will only increase with the more accessible price point,” she says. DashDividers_1_500x100 2025 Engagement Ring Trend: Wavy Bands While the gemstone you select for your engagement ring undoubtedly has a major impact on the overall look and feel of your ring, don’t forget about the band’s role as well: Chunky gold bands have continued to rise in popularity, and Kahane sees wiggly shapes following a similar trajectory in 2025. “A ring with a slight curve or wave in the band has a sleek yet unique feel to it,” she says. “I love it for someone who likes to keep things simple.” DashDividers_1_500x100 2025 Engagement Ring Trend: Colorful Stones Colorful, non-diamond gemstones have been on the engagement ring trend circuit for several seasons now, but it’s predicted to become even more dominant in 2025. “I’m very passionate about thinking outside the diamond box and getting a colored stone or birthstone engagement ring if that suits you better,” Bartrum says.  In terms of value, it can be a smarter choice, Guo argues: “Choosing a valuable colored gemstone as the center stone of an engagement ring is not only beautiful but can be a great investment as well. A five-carat Paraiba engagement ring I designed six years ago is probably worth nearly five times in value today!” DashDividers_1_500x100 2025 Engagement Ring Trend: Heavy Yellow Gold For those with a penchant for yellow gold, 2025 will be your year, as “heavy yellow gold” really hits its stride. “Heavy yellow gold solitaire style rings are still going strong,” Thomas notes, pointing to chunky engagement rings stacked with a bold band. Kahane adds: “The more gold, the better.” DashDividers_1_500x100 2025 Engagement Ring Trend: Bezel Settings If you live a very active lifestyle (or are a bit rough with your jewelry), Guo suggests a setting that protects the main stone, like a bezel. Thomas agrees: “I would say people are still most interested in the bezel and the half bezel or scallop as I call it — a slight twist on the classic.” DashDividers_1_500x100 2025 Engagement Ring Trend: Warm Diamonds Bridging the gap between a diamond and a colorful gemstone, “warm diamonds” are one of Bartrum’s top trend predictions for 2025. They have a slight yellow tint (falling in the I-Z range of the diamond color scale) and are commonly referred to as “champagne diamonds.” DashDividers_1_500x100 2025 Engagement Ring Trend: Vintage Settings For a reliably romantic effect, rings with vintage-inspired settings can transform the look of an engagement ring. “Classic prongs are always popular, but I think we’ll see versions of this with a vintage twist like the addition of a Georgian collet setting, or the use of a gemstone or old mine cut stone in a modern setting to add a more romantic feel to the ring,” Kahane says.
