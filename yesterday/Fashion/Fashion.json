    "description": "Celebrate the new season with sunglasses, coloured tights and dresses with bootsThere may be blossom on the trees, or at least tulips in the supermarket. There is daylight during hours that are your own. Gift shops are a sea of Mother’s Day pink and Easter yellow. You have only the vaguest recollection of what your new year ins-and-outs were, possibly something to do with a lapsed gym membership, but have acquired a new favourite bench in the park. You remember how much you like mini eggs. The first iced coffee of the season is not far off.All of which means one thing: spring is here. What is less certain, however, is how spring-like the weather will be. Some years spring comes all at once, the weather shifting gear in rhythm with the vibe shift. Other years, spring is a state of mind for weeks before it becomes tangible in the air. Most often, we get a bit of both: a few false dawns when it is warm enough to venture out without a coat, and then chilly spells that catch you out before better weather starts in earnest. At the time of writing, it is not yet clear which we are in for. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Haiti's history is filled with vibrant cultural traditions and a spirit of resilience, marked by both periods of massive prosperity and profound struggle. The once-thriving Saint-Domingue was a key producer of sugar, coffee, textile production and much more. However, the country experienced a devastating transition following its independence from France in 1804. Despite the challenges of political instability, natural disasters, and economic hardship that still persist, Haiti's creative pulse remains unshaken. Today, a new generation of Haitian creatives, including designers, makeup artists, and beauty entrepreneurs, are making their mark on the global stage—blending heritage with innovation. While many brands are taking the industry by storm, here are seven dynamic Haitian fashion and beauty brands that reflect the island's creative Caribbean flair and heritage, shaping its promising future built on its rich, complex past.Designed by Haitian-American fashion designer Dayanne Danier, Bien Abyé (which means \"Well Dressed\" in French Creole) offers a variety of handcrafted detailed accessories made by artisans in Haiti.

They’re cozy, they’re comfy, they’re cute — and when made with quality and care, they’re built to last. Plus, let’s talk versatility. Toeing the line between sporty athleisure and polished co-ords, sweatsuits are the ultimate shortcut to looking casual yet put-together. Throw one on when you can't be bothered to style an outfit. Or default to your favorite when tackling a week’s worth of chores in a few hours. Working remotely and need to feel slightly more “dressed” than your pajamas? Problem solved. And on travel days? Sweat sets are an MVP for curling up on chilly flights. Bonus: You can break up a set and wear each piece separately, unlocking endless mix-and-match potential for those moments when you actually want to plan an outfit.If you’re ready to retire those ratty, holey sweats that have seen you through college and countless days under your duvet (no judgment — we’ve all got that pair), consider yourself covered.

    "description": "When finding the perfect pair of work shoes, style ranks high on our wish lists but, naturally, so does comfort. From the subway to the office to after-work cocktails with your friends and beyond, these are the shoes you'll practically be living in daily, so it's important to shop for a pair that'll keep you feeling comfortable, supported, and chic. Ahead, we curated a list of this season's best and most comfortable work shoes for women, from slingback heels and black flats to business-casual shoes that can meet any office's dress-code requirements. Most importantly, they all have one thing in common: they'll become your go-to everyday pair. Depending on your job or daily journey, your comfort (and commute) requirements might have different needs. If you work in a more dressed-up environment with a walking commute, opt for classic, comfortable flats that you can wear with trousers. If your workplace is more casual and you drive, you can probably get away with wearing a pair of heels to spice things up. And, of course, we also made sure to include some versatile sneakers that pair well with all clothing items - and are even favorites of our own editors. Keep reading for our complete guide to the best women's work shoes. With styles from brands like Old Navy, Rothy's, and Everlane, there's something at every price point and markdown. Find your favorites and shop this season's best comfortable work shoes for standing all day.",
