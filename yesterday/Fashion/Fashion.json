In reality, there is no such thing that can be grouped under one name; there are only themes or regional concentrations. North Africa tends to favour a one-piece – a gallabiya, kaftan or head-to-toe swaddle of cloth.

    "description": "Megan Thee Stallion was on a mission as she scanned a room full of fans at the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston: to find the best cosplaying hottie during the opening night of Dream Con. Dozens of attendees rushed to the front of the stage hoping that the costumes they spent hours—weeks and in some cases even months—putting together would catch her attention. The three-time Grammy-winning rapper hyped up a woman with an epic green wig who was dressed as Broly, a character from Dragon Ball Z. And she ran with open arms toward two other women dressed as characters from her favorite anime, My Hero Academia. Meg herself donned a purple wig and dressed as Yoruichi Shihouin from Bleach, one of the many times we’ve seen her cosplay. This time, she was greeted by thousands also in cosplay, cheering and chanting her name. “The hotties are making me feel so good! I feel right at home, babe,” she told host Storymode Bae after admitting she’d been nervous. And by “home,” she didn’t mean that solely because the convention and sold-out panel were in her hometown. After the fandom convention hosted by the popular streaming group RDCWorld announced Meg as the headliner, controversy followed. Social media users called out the organizers for engaging with posts in support of Tory Lanez. Some speculated that Meg would pull out of the convention altogether, even despite her tequila brand, Chicas Divertidas, being a sponsor. Others said the incident highlighted a broader issue: a hostile environment for Black women overall at Dream Con, where about 28,000 attendees were expected. Organizers issued an apology to the rapper on X: “We recognize that our actions contributed to a negative online environment, and we take full responsibility as we work toward fostering a more positive and respectful space.” Black women leading up to and at Friday’s panel held organizers’ feet to the fire and made sure that Meg felt celebrated and seen.  The misogynoir Meg faced isn’t unique. Black women and femmes in anime and gaming communities often face disrespect and criticism just for existing in the space. And like Meg, their balm for this hasn’t been to retreat from the hobbies they love, but rather to show up and show out. And they did just that at Dream Con 2025. Personifying their favorite heroes, villains, memes and more, Black women practiced boundless imagination and whimsical escapism. The convention also hosted numerous women-led panels. “I feel like being here is us contributing to a better culture so we can see other women that are like us like, ‘Hey girl, we see you, You don’t have to worry about the femcels and the incels and all those people who are trying to make you to be who you aren’t.’” said Bernette Fondong, a 28-year-old visiting from Atlanta. Fondong, who has been cosplaying for eight years, came dressed as Marvel’s Scarlet Witch. She attended with her friend Trisha Pilgrim, 28, from Maryland. As a nod to her queer identity, Pilgrim cosplayed as Emporio Ivankov, a gender-bending character in One Piece.  “I just really appreciate that Black women are creating that space and we’re coming out and we’re cosplaying and we’re just creating that space in spite of it all,” Pilgrim said. “We really know how to stand against adversity. I feel like we’re just making it a more accepting culture for women to feel more free in their cosplay and to show up and be here.” Even outside of the cosplay community, it’s long been considered taboo for Black people to lean into nerd culture. And though there’s been more visibility and acceptance in recent years, there are still few official spaces for Black nerds to gather en masse. For attendees experiencing their first anime convention, like Chantel Green, spaces like Dream Con attract a special energy. “My first animecon ends up being a Black anime con and it makes me really excited because Black nerds, we just weren’t seen,” said the 31-year-old from Detroit. She dressed as Persephone from Lore Olympus. “For me to come here, I feel truly blessed and I feel happy here.” Cosplay for Black women has also become an outlet for them to express their creativity with special makeup effects, stitching techniques and hairstyling. And it’s a steadily growing community. Alex Box, 28, was inspired to cosplay by her mother, a costume designer who worked on prom dresses and Princess Tiana gowns. The Houston native valued the bonding time she got to spend with her as she got guidance in making her Elphelt Valentine costume, which took four months to make.  Lanihya Duncan, a 27-year-old from Chicago who studied special effects makeup in college, got into cosplaying after her friend suggested it to her. Now at her second Dream Con, she took pride in her handmade Lulu from Final Fantasy costume, which took her two months to create. For Duncan, spaces like Dream Con allow Black weebs to not have to hide who they are. “Being Black, it can be hard for people to really show that because [of pressure to] fit in,” she said. “ But Dream Con is like no, you can be both. It’s amazing to embrace because Black cosplayers have that little umph that you can’t see. Who else is gonna be rocking braids, cornrows and afros with a Killua costume?” Gabrielle Kanu, a 35-year-old Houston native, said cosplaying feels “freeing.” Since 2016, she’s dressed as Sailor Moon, Storm and Sophie Hatter. This year, she’s Dorothy, giving a mix of The Wiz and The Wizard of Oz. “There’s no trying to codeswitch for anybody. We can be us all the time, every time. You can see the beauty and shapes of everybody around here. I’m a little plump and I’m glad I am and you see everyone else who’s glad of who they are,” she said “It’s kind of like being at an HBCU. It’s literally like a homecoming.” @_tarynitup Meg teased a new anime she’s making at #DreamCon ♬ original sound – Taryn Finley During Friday’s event, Meg also announced that she’s making an anime with Prime Video. Though she didn’t go into the details, she revealed that she collaborated with Boondocks producer and voice actor Carl Jones to create it. This marks a major stride for Black women behind the scenes in anime and opens up the genre for newcomers to dip their toe in. While it’s not on Black women to fix the sexism, homophobia and transphobia they encounter in alternative spaces — or in any spaces for that matter — there’s an intrinsic power we possess in showing up as we are in these types of spaces. For Meg, the public has witnessed her do that time and time again. “My proudest achievement is staying strong through adversity. I feel like a lot of people in my shoes would have gave up,” she said during the Q\u0026A. “The Hotties have my back.” Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/miami-swim-week-trends-2025?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Every May, Miami’s streets get an extra dose of vibrant colors, shimmering fabrics, and glistening skin as brands, models, influencers, and fashion lovers congregate for a celebration of swimwear and resortwear. And this year’s Paraiso Miami Swim Week was no exception — making a splash with every show and preview.From local Miami-based brands, like Luli Fama and Sigal, to up-and-coming LATAM brands presented by Vogue Mexico and many more, the runways featured new collections and trends to get excited about. Some still ring true from 2024’s swim week, like ombré sunset palettes, netted coverups, sparkles galore, and cowboy-styling touches. But we made sure to look out for fresh, unexpected trends that’ll have you standing out this summer.  A welcomed return of swim shorts, surprising fiery red statement pieces, unexpected resortwear cardigans, and countless other styles beckoned to us like sirens. Ahead, explore the top Miami Swim Week trends to elevate your own swim collection and inspire your summer vacation outfits. DashDividers_1_500x100 Swimsuit Trend: Under-The-Sea Designs \u0026 Clam Shell Tops Seashells and starfish and squids, oh my! From intricate beaded designs and 3D appliqués to fish prints and kitsch shapes, the under-the-sea theme (echoing on the same summer 2025 dress trend) was ubiquitous. French-inspired, Italian-made brand Oséree brought us Little Mermaid-approved clam shell-shaped necklines on one-pieces and dresses, while luxury London-based Oceanus showcased hand-embroidered seascapes across its swim and resortwear. Meanwhile, Florida’s Salty Mermaid gave a version with playful shell and palm tree patches on bikini tops.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Swimsuit Trend: Retro Swim Skirts \u0026 Shorts We were pleased to see a return of swim skirts and shorts, offering a retro touch that gives Americana or European Summer vibes, depending on styling. Since itty-bitty bottoms have become more prevalent, this extra coverage actually feels quite refreshing. Nearly every brand surprisingly showed swim skorts (or mini skirts over bikini bottoms), and a few like luxury Paris-based brand Leslie Amon, Instagram-able Florida brands Montce and Monday Swimwear leaned into the ‘70s hot pants look, all with matching tops. Try this trend if you’re hoping to have a nostalgia-tinged summer. DashDividers_1_500x100 Swimsuit Trend: Transitional Swim Cardigans Yet another happy surprise was the influx of cardigans in the form of swim tops, coverup separates, and resortwear. Not quite the preppy staple you may be expecting on the sand, but brands made cardigans beach-ready via relaxed tie-front designs (Shan and Oséree) or with stones and shell-shaped hardware (Azulu and Leslie Amon). These styles are especially ideal for extra sun protection and for going from the pool to a restaurant without changing. DashDividers_1_500x100 Swimsuit Trend: Fiery Red Amongst the expected sea of blues and sunset hues, on-trend butter yellows and pistachio greens brought extra joy. But it was the bright red swimwear that really popped from the rest. The mod-inspired collection from Azulu gave us matching sets, while chili-pepper-embroidered designs from Sigal diverged from its usual hand-painted prints. Cupshe also featured the bombshell color on swimwear, including some colorblocked with purple for even bolder looks. DashDividers_1_500x100 Swimsuit Trend: Peek-a-Boo Thong Straps We were doing double takes all week as double-strap bikini bottoms appeared on the runways. From cleverly-placed waist cut-outs (Montage) to extra straps only visible from the back (Luli Fama), these styles gave the illusion of wearing two pairs of bottoms. Thong straps attached to, or peeking out from, low-slung coverups and lounge pants (Oh Polly) was also a popular version of the look. DashDividers_1_500x100 Swimsuit Trend: Creative Crochet Coverups \u0026 Appliqués Intricate crocheted pieces added extra texture to many collections this year. Of course, it manifested mostly through simple coverups, but elements like shimmering yarns, 3D crochet rosettes, and fish appliqués elevated them. Brands like Leslie Amon, Salty Mermaid, Oséree, and Cupshe even created full-on crochet bikinis or sets that featured crochet details on bra cups and bikini straps for an extra-special touch. DashDividers_1_500x100 Swimsuit Trend: Bold Cut-Out One-Pieces We’re all sure to have a hot girl summer like Megan Thee Stallion, who debuted her new swimwear brand by walking the show in a metallic one-piece swimsuit with a bold torso cut-out. Many brands similarly designed suits with multiple daring cut-outs, making for intriguing looks (and even more interesting tan lines). When you’re searching for a one-piece this summer, look out for these skin-baring details and low-back silhouettes that are also versatile enough to wear as a bodysuit for al fresco dinners, music festivals, and other summer activities.

TikTok star Tinx first blew the lid off Jenner's budget-friendly secret by finding the exact tank and sharing with her followers. \"I was obsessed with this pic because Kendall's white tank is perfect,\" she said in her TikTok. \"I asked my shopaholic community, 'Where's it from?' They all said Hanes. I'm 99% sure it's a Hanes Boys Tank.\" A boys tank? Say what? I was shook. How could something so basic be so iconic? After some serious sleuthing, I tracked down the viral Hanes tank - a kids' size, no less - and I had to try it. Spoiler alert: Tinx was absolutely right. This tank is a must. It's the perfect sheer balance, comes in a five-pack, and costs next to nothing. So naturally, I'm wearing it everywhere. Seriously, it's about to become your new favorite wardrobe essential. @tinx #greenscreen ♬ original sound - Tinx What I Like About the Hanes Ecosmart Cotton Tank Aside from the unbeatable price, there's honestly a lot to love about this ribbed white tank. For starters, the cut does something my usual tanks just don't. That swooped neckline? It somehow makes the whole thing look effortlessly chic. Plus, it goes with anything. Sweatpants? Definitely. Denim shorts? Obviously. A skirt and some jewelry? Absolutely. Case in point: Jenner styled hers with leather pants, and it looks totally high fashion. Another thing - I'm not the neatest eater, and when I drop $20-$30 on a tank from somewhere like Zara, I basically count it as a one-wear risk (especially in white). But with this? I've got four more in the pack. Worst-case scenario, I just grab another set on Amazon. No stress. What to Consider Before Buying the Hanes Ecosmart Cotton Tank Image Source: PS Photography | Haley Lyndes First off, this is technically a boys' tank top. It comes pre-shrunk in a pack of five. I got mine in an XL, but probably could've gone with a large (that's what Tinx got, and hers fits perfectly). The fabric is thin, but the 50% cotton, 50% polyester blend has a good amount of stretch, so it'll give if you need it to. It also features a double-ply neckband and moisture-wicking technology to keep you cool on hot days. Now, if the boys' sizing feels a little too risky, Hanes makes a Women's Originals Knit Cotton Rib Tank Pack ($13), which I also own and can confirm I like just as much. They're not quite as sheer either. The takeaway? You don't need to spend $$ on ribbed white tank tops. Take a page from Jenner's book - even a kids' version can work. Who Is Hanes Ecosmart Cotton Tank Best For? If you're into that effortless, model-off-duty vibe Jenner always nails, this tank is for you. It's a super simple piece, but it still feels cool - like you just threw it on and somehow look pulled together. It's great for anyone who wants to hop on a viral trend without dropping $$$. The fit has that slightly shrunken, vintage feel (because yes, it's technically a boys' tank), and the neckline gives it just the right amount of edge. It also layers really well - under an open button-down, with a blazer, whatever. Or you can just wear it with sweats and call it a day. No wrong answers here. Additional Details The Hanes Boys Tank comes in sizes XS–XL and is sold in a five-pack. Each ribbed tank is pre-shrunk, so it holds its shape wash after wash. It's designed with a tagless interior - aka, no itching. Made from lightweight fabric, it's perfect for hot summer days. Where Is the Hanes Ecosmart Cotton Tank Available? The Hanes Ecosmart Cotton Tank is available on the brand's website, Amazon, Walmart, Kohls, and more.

Now, the tour is well under way as the music legend takes her rodeo-inspired show on the road throughout 2025. Of course with any Beyoncé concert, attendees are guaranteed a couple things: an otherworldly performance filled with stadium-shaking vocals, high-energy dance routines, and an electric setlist of back-to-back hits that only one of the world's greatest entertainers could nail nightly. While Beyoncé's concert outfits are always a topic of conversation, the visuals for her \"Cowboy Carter\" album have provided a whole new category of style inspiration for BeyHive members looking to mirror the star's inimitable aesthetic. Stylistically, fans' \"Cowboy Carter\" outfits are bound to pay homage to the star's most beloved eras - think lots of glitzy, latex bodysuit looks á la \"Renaissance\" mixed with \"I Am... Sasha Fierce\"-inspired metallics and, of course, \"Cowboy Carter\"-esque country vibes.

Much like her previous tours, we predict a sea of rhinestone-embellished ensembles teamed with cowgirl hats and statement pieces that play into the superstar's looks both on and off the red carpet - like over-the-knee boots, curve-defining dresses, denim jumpers, and bold jewelry. Whether you want to channel the magic of a Beyoncé concert or immerse yourself in it for the first time, we've rounded up the best concert outfit ideas that are all inspired by the star herself - and perfect to wear to any upcoming stops on her \"Cowboy Carter\" tour. From Levi's jeans and metallic Western boots to rhinestone-tassel cowgirl hats, these are looks you'll be excited to dance and scream-sing in all night long.
