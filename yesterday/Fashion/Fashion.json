Short cuts kept close to a head’s profile, longer bobs swung in movement but dropped straight as a curtain at rest.Then in 1974, Sassoon’s young artistic director, Trevor Sorbie, saw how a model’s locks fell full and chunky as he pulled a brush through them, and, impromptu, cut that shape into her hair. This was 3D geometry. Voila, the Wedge, so striking that Vogue allotted it an unprecedented double-page spread. The cut was imitated worldwide, an emblem of the 70s like the platform soles and wide flares it balanced. Continue reading...",

For maximalist fashion aficionados, the seemingly endless roster of holiday occasions is a welcomed opportunity to bring out their most over-the-top accessories and ultra-glam dresses. However, to minimalists, party dressing is oftentimes a cause to flip their closets upside down — it’s the one time of year when the timeless Little Black Dress just doesn’t seem to cut it. But, fear not, there are ways to coordinate a festive outfit that’s simultaneously on-trend and pared down.  This season, take a “going out” top up a notch with lingerie-inspired details, opt for a runway-approved pop of color, or find a less-is-more dress that offers up a surprise via an eye-catching detail. If head-to-toe velvet or sequins aren’t your thing, ahead, discover seven trends and styling tricks that will boost your look from been-there-done-that to head-turning holiday outfit. Holiday Dressing Trend: Runway-Approved Red While red is a holiday classic, the rich shade was on repeat on the fall 2024 runways as designers offered up options ranging from dresses to handbags and stockings in a juicy, dark cherry. If a red dress still feels a bit too statement-making even in a darker shade, go for a neutral look and punctuate it with a red pair of heels and a coordinating clutch. Holiday Dressing Trend: Lingerie Details Lingerie-inspired details are a subtle way to add a sultry spin to an outfit without leaning towards over-the-top cut-outs or head-to-toe mesh. For holiday dressing, try a slip dress with a lace trim, date night-ready top with a dainty bow, or a corset top that hits in all the right places. Holiday Dressing Trend: Gold Standard I’ll be the first to admit: Metallics aren’t the most minimalistic of trends. That said, certain shades of gold feel close enough to a light brown that they lose the intimidation factor that silver apparel often holds. Give this “neutral” color a go in a skirt styled back to a black top, or try a dress or pant-and-top set for a more daring look. Holiday Dressing Trend: Open Back Sophisticated silhouettes with longer lengths and higher necklines are on the rise this season, but that doesn’t mean that they can’t be sexy. A dress or top with an open back balances both aesthetics in one look while remaining a solid addition to a minimalist’s wardrobe — talk about a win-win. Holiday Dressing Trend: Winter White Sometimes, the best outfits don’t require as much effort as you’d think. Swap your LBD for a head-to-toe white (or cream or ivory) ensemble, and you’ll stand out in the crowd of darker hues and jewel tones. Make even more of a statement with a monochrome look by styling your outfit with white footwear and a handbag, too. Holiday Dressing Trend: Button-Downs (With Fancy Bottoms) Opting for a white button-down, paired with a bolder bottom, is a surefire way to achieve a balanced holiday outfit. Whether you style it with a sparkly skirt (as seen on celebrities like Zendaya and Alessandra Ambrosio) or a cool pair of leather trousers, the juxtaposition will earn major styling points on the party circuit. Holiday Dressing Trend: Statement Earrings The easiest way to elevate a simple outfit? An eye-catching pair of earrings. Designers played with this trend in a whimsical way at Area and Simone Rocha with motifs like hearts and flowers, as well as a more grown-up approach with sculptural metals and details that mimic vintage jewelry design techniques at Saint Laurent and Chanel. Grab your favorite LBD, slick back your hair, and put on a pair of conversation-starting earrings. Like what you see?

The holidays are the best time to play weird and wacky card games with your cousins, cozy up on the couch with your pets, and drink festive cocktails and hot chocolates. So what if we said there’s a fashion collection designed precisely for all of that? Reformation and Shrimps have teamed up on a small capsule collection of cool-weather sweaters and knit accessories inspired by a deck of cards. And with Reformation’s charm and British brand Shrimps’ playfulness, it’ll be hard to pass up this whimsical holiday collection. The luxe yet unserious collaboration includes sweaters made from responsibly sourced wool and recycled cashmere, each featuring motifs of diamonds, hearts, clovers, or clubs. Details like gold buttons, satin ribbons, or scalloped collars elevate each unique style, and will surely make you feel like a real Queen of Hearts. The sweaters are also complemented by a festive red wool head scarf, a set of crocheted coasters, and even a cable-knit dog sweater. That means your furry friends can dress in style this holiday season, too. Ranging between $98 and $348, these wool and cashmere styles are perfect to treat yourself. But if you’re looking ahead to holiday shopping, they’re also great options to gift to your fashion-forward friends. Shop full Reformation x Shrimps collaboration Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/vera-bradley-women-cotton-hathaway-tote-review-49406550",
    "description": "Out of pure curiosity (and with a little fear of the cringe), I recently scrolled way too far back in my old photos to pinpoint the last time I proudly toted a Vera Bradley bag. After wading through a parade of painfully awkward concert pics, I finally spotted it: my beloved hot-pink wristlet, in a photo timestamped 2010 on Facebook. That fabric wristlet went everywhere with me until one fateful day when I tucked it away in my closet next to its matching tote and, honestly, forgot it even existed - that is, until 2024. Lately, I've been getting the sense that Vera Bradley is on the brink of a comeback. The brand has stepped beyond its iconic floral prints, embracing more modern styles like understated colors, trendy bows, bag charms, and youthful silhouettes like crescent shapes (kind of similar to my favorite Staud bag, but in a signature Vera pattern and unstructured shape). Naturally, I had to scope out their updated lineup (specifically on Amazon because I'm an impatient Prime shopper), and before I knew it, the Cotton Hathaway Tote ($70, originally $100) was in my cart. So, did this order spark the official rekindling of my Vera Bradley love affair? The verdict, ahead. About the Vera Bradley Cotton Hathaway Tote The Vera Bradley Women's Cotton Hathaway Tote is available in seven designs on Amazon, or nine if you shop directly from Vera Bradley's site. It comes in four fabric options: cotton, nylon, leather, and canvas. Choose from three sizes: mini, small, and regular. The regular size measures 13.25\"W x 13.0\"H x 5.25\"D with a 10.25-inch handle drop. It's machine-washable on a cold, gentle cycle with like colors. What I Like About the Vera Bradley Cotton Hathaway Tote What I love about the Vera Bradley Women's Cotton Hathaway Tote is, first and foremost, its understated autumnal hues. I chose the Marrakesh Cinnamon design, which features a warm brown base topped with a rich floral pattern. It has a subtly bohemian vibe and feels quintessentially autumn. Unlike the bold pink bags I used to carry back in 2010, this one's easy to style with my everyday wardrobe. I honestly can't remember if Vera Bradley offered anything this toned down back then, but back in the day, it felt like their unofficial motto was \"the brighter, the better.\" Another thing I love about this tote is the size. I used to own what's now called the Original Tote Bag, and let's just say, I had no business using it as a bookbag in high school. I'd stuff it with textbooks, workout clothes for gym class, and anything else that could fit until it was so overloaded I had to grab a second bag. Now, as an adult, it's such a relief to have a bag that's spacious (but not too spacious) and perfect for stashing my essentials - like a lightweight jacket, book, water bottle, wallet, makeup bag, you name it - without feeling overstuffed. Maybe it's the nostalgia or simply how much I love my new purchase, but carrying this handbag just puts me in a good mood. I'm a texture person, so the soft cotton reminds me of all things warm and cozy. It feels easy, familiar, and effortlessly stylish, like it's always been a part of my wardrobe. What to Consider Before Buying the Vera Bradley Cotton Hathaway Tote One concern that popped up a few times in the reviews was that some shoppers weren't sure how to tie the bag to achieve the folded-in sides shown in one of the product photos. \"I can't for the life of me get the sides to fold in like it shows in the description picture,\" one reviewer shared, giving it three stars. \"That was the only reason I got this because I wanted to have the ends fold in so it's not a huge, bulky, wide bag.\" While I hadn't initially thought about compressing the tote, once I figured it out, I couldn't wait to wear it that way. Inside, there are two strings you simply tie together in a bow, and the sides naturally fold in. Just secure the tie closure, and voilà - you've got a more compact, less bulky bag that looks extra chic. I'm excited to wear it this way on days when I only need a few essentials and can forgo the full-size tote. Where Is the Vera Bradley Cotton Hathaway Tote Available? The Vera Bradley Women's Cotton Hathaway Tote is available on Amazon as well as direct-to-consumer from the brand's website.
