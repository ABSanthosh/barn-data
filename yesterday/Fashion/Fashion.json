    "description": "Fashionistas are forking out a fortune as the humble anti-perspirant goes high endOnce humble, bought for a quid and used with little pleasure, deodorant has done an about-face. Where it used to be a simple case of misting armpits with Lynx or spritzing with Sure, in recent times the world of deodorant has evolved to offer products that cost as much as fancy face serums and smell as good as fine scents.Encapsulating deodorant’s shift from lowly to elevated is To My Ships, a brand launched last year in London. Apparently inspired by The Iliad, and yours for £35, it is inspired by “a desire for cleaner armpits, and an intention to quell olfactory overload”. If all that sounds highfalutin, this “cultured personal care offer” speaks for itself with a delicious scent and an ability to rival pong. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Schitt’s Creek’s matriarch and fan fave Moira Rose said it best: Our favorite season isn’t winter, spring, summer, or fall — it’s awards season. And thankfully, the best season of the year is finally upon us. The Golden Globes has long been viewed as one of the most fun awards shows, bringing celebs from both the small and big screens together over dinner and drinks and to hand out a few awards, of course. And that includes on the red carpet. At the 82nd annual Golden Globes, the stars are showing up and showing out. While the 2024 Golden Globes carpet was awash with colour and celebs dressing for joy, the 2025 carpet was a little more subdued in tone, with celebs like Ashley Graham, Lilly Singh, and A Complete Unknown’s Monica Barbaro walking the carpet in stark blacks, midnight blues and shades of grey (plus some pops of monochromatic gold and red looks from actresses Mindy Kaling, Cate Blanchett, Ali Wong, and Maren Morris). Maybe it’s an indicator that we can expect a more serious tone on the carpet for the rest of awards season — or just a reminder that nothing can top an LBD. We'll keep updating this as the night goes on.Photo: Amy Sussman/Getty Images.Photo: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images.Photo: Amy Sussman/Getty Images.Photo: Amy Sussman/Getty Images.Photo: Amy Sussman/Getty Images.Photo: Amy Sussman/Getty Images.Photo: Amy Sussman/Getty Images.Photo: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images.Photo: Amy Sussman/Getty Images.Photo: Amy Sussman/Getty Images.Photo: Amy Sussman/Getty Images.Zoë KravitzZoë Kravitz in Custom Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello.Photo: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images.Cynthia ErivoCynthia Erivo in Louis Vuitton.Photo: Michael Buckner/GG2025/Penske Media/Getty Images.Liza Colón-ZayasLiza Colón-Zayas in custom Christian Siriano.

    "description": "On Sunday, millions of people will tune into the 82nd Golden Globe Awards for the annual star-studded occasion and the official kickoff of this year’s awards season. And, of course, red carpet fashion will be all the talk as we also start the new year.In celebration of this red carpet's return, we're looking back decades to show off the best red carpet looks from each year between 2024 to 1989 — that is, except for 2008, when the Writers Guild of America went on strike and the whole event was canceled, and 2022, when backlash against the Hollywood Foreign Press put the award ceremony on hold.From the white satin gown Audrey Hepburn donned while receiving the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1990 and Saoirse Ronan's #METOO-inspired black Versace gown in 2018 to Michelle Yeoh’s proof that the peplum is back in 2023, these are the best looks we've seen in over three decades of the Golden Globes.2024Past Lives star Greta Lee looked breathtaking on the red carpet in this billowing, draped-back bespoke gown by Loewe.Greta Lee in Loewe.Photo: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images.2024Hi Barbie! Margot Robbie sparkled all night long in this hot pink custom Armani Privé gown and tulle boa that pays homage to the 1977 Superstar Barbie.

Not only did she win her very first Golden Globe for a stunning performance in Lady Bird, but she also shut the red carpet down in this stunning black and silver Atelier Versace gown.Saoirse Ronan in Atelier Versace.Photo: Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images.2017Draped in Chanel Couture, Riley Keough might have been new to the Golden Globes in 2017, but she looked anything but out of place on the red carpet.Riley Keough in Chanel Couture.Photo: Steve Granitz/WireImage.2016Anyone can do Old Hollywood, but no one, and we mean no one, does it quite like Lady Gaga. With a Marilyn Monroe 'do that rivals Ms. Monroe herself, this off-the-shoulder Versace gown and 10-inch Brian Atwood heels, we find ourselves wondering, is there anything Gaga can't do?Lady Gaga in Versace.Photo: Jason Merritt/Getty Images.2015Wearing black on the red carpet is hardly groundbreaking, but Amal Clooney has a way of standing out in a crowd, especially when she's donning head-to-toe Dior Haute Couture.Amal Clooney in Dior Haute Couture.Photo: George Pimentel/WireImage.2014For a Golden Globes first-timer, Lupita Nyong'o walked this red carpet like a seasoned pro — or rather, a superhero, in this cape-like gown by Ralph Lauren.Lupita Nyong'o in Ralph Lauren.Photo: Steve Granitz/WireImage.2013Patchwork has never looked better than it did in 2013 on Zoe Saldaña in this Prabal Gurung strapless frock.Zoe Saldaña in Prabal Gurung.Photo: Steve Granitz/WireImage.2012We've yet to spot Angelina Jolie looking anything short of fabulous on the red carpet circuit, but this show-stopping Atelier Versace gown is hands down her best.Angelina Jolie in Atelier Versace.Photo: George Pimentel/WireImage.2011Low back! Sequins! Long sleeves! All boxes were checked when Anne Hathaway stepped foot on the red carpet in this Armani Privé gown.Anne Hathaway in Armani Privé.Photo: Evan Agostini/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty Images.2010A few showers couldn't stop Cameron Diaz (and that dazzling smile) from showing up her competition in this drapey Alexander McQueen gown.Cameron Diaz in Alexander McQueen.Photo: SGranitz/WireImage.2009Admittedly, lavender in January might seem bold, but when it's Olivia Wilde underneath this Reem Acra gown, all bets are off.Olivia Wilde in Reem Acra.Photo: Steve Granitz/WireImage.2007Not that there's anything Queen Bey doesn't look stunning in, but even she outdid herself with this gold, sequined Elie Saab number.Beyoncé in Elie Saab.Photo: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images.2006Looking back on 2006 style, it hardly seems possible that Keira Knightley's strapless Valentino dress came out of the same year as chunky belts and low-rise cargo pants.Keira Knightley in Valentino.Photo: Jeff Vespa/WireImage.2005As the mastermind behind Poise magazine (calling all 13 Going on 30 fans!), it comes as no surprise that Jennifer Garner (with the help of this vintage Valentino gown) would beat out any and all competition on the red carpet.Jennifer Garner in vintage Valentino.Photo: SGranitz/WireImage.2004While this look might not have garnered very much appreciation back in '04, we're still tipping our hats to the master of menswear, Diane Keaton, for showing up to the Golden Globes donning a collared white coat, itty bitty sunglasses and sequin boots.Diane Keaton in Nehru-collared white coat.

Then again, we're still looking for something Halle Berry doesn't look perfect in.Halle Berry in Valentino.Photo: SGranitz/WireImage.2001A slip dress to the Golden Globes? Normally we'd say no way, but there's just something about Kate Hudson in Vera Wang that has us tossing normal red carpet rules out the window.Kate Hudson in Vera Wang.Photo: KMazur/WireImage.2000At the height of Sex and the City's prime, it hardly comes as a surprise that fashion icon Sarah Jessica Parker, would show up looking fabulous on the red carpet. We only wish she'd give us a hint to what shoes she's wearing underneath this Richard Tyler tulle gown.Sarah Jessica Parker in Richard Tyler.Photo: Frank Micelotta/Getty Images.1999Typically we'd shudder at the thought of a two-piece ensemble on the red carpet, but this Pamela Dennis black-and-white duo on Calista Flockhart has us making a special exception.Calista Flockhart in Pamela Dennis.Photo: SGranitz/WireImage.1998What is it everyone says? Dress for the award you want? That's exactly what Alfre Woodard did in this statuesque bronze gown.Alfre Woodard in a bronze dress.

Sharon Stone in Vera Wang.Photo: Ke.Mazur/WireImage.1995We're always keen on a red carpet look that goes against the grain, so naturally, Uma Thurman showing up to the Golden Globes in this classic satin coat instead of a dress has us bowing our hats.Uma Thurman in a white coat.

It's no surprise this two-piece trend is making a major comeback when you look at Julia Roberts in this navy blue pinstripe style.Julia Roberts in a navy blue suit.

But this long-sleeved red gown on Hotel star Connie Selleca is just as chic now as it was back then.

    "description": "How you end the year may influence how the entire year ahead turns out. Specifically, when we're talking style, some people believe the color underwear you choose for New Year's Eve could be potentially prophetic. Whether you're attending a party or lounging at home to watch the ball drop, if you want to put thought into the color of your panties and what that hue could symbolize, keep reading. The idea? Each color is associated with a specific quality you hope to embody in 2025. Founder of PSYKHE and fashion psychologist Anabel Maldonado explains that the superstition ties into the concept of \"enclothed cognition.\" This theory argues that how we dress informs our psychological processes, thoughts, and feelings. Two researchers at Northwestern University, Hajo Adam and Adam Galinsky, coined the concept after their studies showed that people wearing white doctor's coats were more attentive during a series of tasks than those wearing white painter's coats. The reason tied back to their prior assumptions about a doctor's heightened ability to focus. \"While the superstitions have a much more metaphysical interpretation - aka the color will magically make things happen for you - I believe our ancestors were just missing the middle step: the fact that if we think it and believe it, we're halfway there to what we desire,\" Maldonado says, sharing that some of the women she grew up with in her Latin culture wore red underwear on New Year's Eve for a good love life. Ahead, discover the different colors and what they are said to symbolize. Then, shop selects from popular lingerie brands once you decide what you're manifesting for 2025.
