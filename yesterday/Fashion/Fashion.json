Does your holiday tote bag have a shell bag charm? Cute. Does your maxidress have pom-poms dangling from it? Um, OK, I’m sure it’s lovely, but let’s take a moment here, shall we? Are you completely sure you need to coordinate your beach jellies with your candy-striped shorts and cropped top? Look, I’m going to come out and ask the question here. Have our holiday wardrobes got a bit … overexcited?I don’t want to be a killjoy. But there is a fine line between a cheerful holiday aesthetic and looking as though you bought the entire contents of your suitcase while on a sangria-fuelled shopping spree at Gatwick. Beguiling though all this stuff is, there is a point where tomato-print sundresses and sandals with ric-rac lacing stop looking delightfully Dolce, and start looking a tiny bit overwrought.

    "description": "From photo-editing apps to ‘Instagram face’, technology has radically altered the way we see ourselves. Ahead of a new exhibition at Somerset House, our critic considers the meaning of art in a digital ageIt’s the artist Qualeasha Wood who tells me about Snapchat dysmorphia, “a term coined by plastic surgeons who noticed there was a shift in the mid 2010s when people started bringing in their AI-beautified portraits instead of a celebrity picture”. To resolve your Snapchat dysmorphia, you get your real face remodelled to look like the ideal version of you that artificial intelligence has perfected on your phone screen.There is a fundamental problem with this, says Adam Lowe, whose Factum Foundation in Madrid is at the forefront of art and technology, digitally documenting artworks and cultural heritage sites around the world. When you have surgery to look like your best self as shown on a flat screen, the results in three-dimensional reality can be very odd indeed.

    "description": "Ariana Madix's sartorial sense first captured our hearts during her time on Bravo's \"Vanderpump Rules.\" From the revenge dress shared all over social media to her go-to designer handbag, we knew she was a style star since her debut back in season two. Since then, she's become a bona fide fashion darling as the impeccably-dressed host of \"Love Island USA.\" The actress and restaurateur, who just celebrated her 40th birthday, says her TV hosting outfits are like her \"children\" - and, given the effort and talent that goes into choosing each one, the analogy fits. This season, Madix's looks are the talk of the \"Love Island USA\" universe, from a LaQuan Smith pink ab cutout gown that's currently trending on TikTok to a red minidress that feels like a nod to her \"Vanderpump Rules\" reunion days. And there are plenty of outfits and glam moments to come from her time in Fiji. Working closely with stylist Emily Men with assistance from Karissa Loveday, Madix chooses summer-ready outfits that exude main-character energy, perfect to recreate if you're hosting a birthday dinner or even attending a fancy party. Whether she's strutting in a gown covered in colorful paillettes or posing in a glittering metallic low-rise skirt, she ensures all eyes are on her with every outfit change. Ahead, check out Ariana Madix's best \"Love Island USA\" looks from season seven - and shop available and inspired pieces in time for your next event.",
