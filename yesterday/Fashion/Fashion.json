What comprises this uniform is wide-ranging, from monochrome ankle-length Arab thobes to colourful south Asian kurtas, easy tracksuits to stylish blazers.

I use a blow-dryer and straightener each time I wash; I used to wash my hair every other day. I now wash it about 2 times per week; I imagine from brushing, my hair doesn’t get as oily as quickly as it used to – which is why I wash it way less than I used to.

The nightlight creates a soft glow that's soothing before bed, and there's just something nice about being able to turn off the alarm by reaching over and pressing down on its bar (great haptics) without having to look for my phone in the morning.The two-phase alarm is genius — I usually hate waking up in the morning, but the initial \"wake up\" sounds are pleasant \u0026 they don't jar me out of bed because I know I have another few minutes to sleep before I have to actually 'get up' with the second phase.

    "description": "This holiday season, we’ve found the gifts that feel great to get and even better to give. Shop Well-Received, our collection of editor-approved holiday gift guides, here and shop this gift guide on Pinterest here.Gone are the days when secondhand meant second-best. Climate-conscious shoppers are embracing circular fashion, luxury resale has become a favorite among trendsetters, and secondhand clothes and accessories have transformed into both acceptable and highly desirable gifts. This holiday season, more and more people are maximizing their gift budgets with pre-loved treasures.Thanks to thrift stores and resale platforms like Depop, The RealReal, and eBay, you can score designer handbags and shoes, quality winter accessories, and cult pieces from beloved brands — all for a fraction of the retail price. Gifting someone a secondhand item may take a little extra effort — like knowing their style preferences and clothing or shoe size (and making sure that the item is in gift-appropriate condition) — but it’s a meaningful way to show you care about both them and the environment. “There’s a real romance in gifting something that has lived a previous life,” vintage seller Erin Murphy tells Refinery29. “With secondhand gifts, you’re gifting the story of the piece with someone who means something to you.” Whether you’re shopping for the person who “doesn’t want anything” or one with a taste for luxury, here are 13 secondhand treasures every fashion-lover will adore this season.At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff. All of our market picks are independently selected and curated by the editorial team. If you buy something we link to on our site, Refinery29 may earn commission.An Oblong HandbagY2K-inspired elongated handbags are trending right now, including East-West silhouettes and Fendi Baguettes. This holiday season, go the extra mile by sourcing a style from its original era. “A vintage leather bag is the perfect secondhand gift: It’s a wardrobe staple that keeps its quality,” Vivien Tang, owner of Vivien’s Vintage, tells Refinery29. Coach Dark Brown Shoulder Bag, $, available at DepopA Silk ScarfScour the internet (or IRL stores) for a silk scarf to complement your giftee’s wardrobe. Since one can be worn around the neck or wrist, as a headscarf or a bag accessory, it’s like multiple gifts in one. Find a unique design from past eras, like a cool digital print from the ‘90s or geometric designs from earlier in the century. Liberty London 100% Silk Vintage Square Neck Scarf, 17”, $, available at EtsyA Ring Watch This mid-century trend is officially back. Not quite a watch, nor just a ring, a ring watch makes a great gift for any trendsetter. While there are plenty of new iterations on the market (see here), pre-loved vintage styles will likely have more personality than newer iterations. Perform a quick polish and it’s ready to dazzle under the tree. (Tip: use the keyword “vintage” and search for eras between the ‘50s and ‘80s for the most authentic style.) Vintage Women's Gold Watch Ring, $, available at DepopA Unique BroochBrooches are also back in fashion (i.e., a vintage-seller’s dream) and are a chic addition to any outfit. Shop everything from ornate, antique styles with colorful gemstones (can you find their birthstone?) to minimalist pins that are perfect for stacking.Miriam Haskell Vintage Faux Pearl \u0026 Crystal Brooch, $, available at The RealRealA Retro TeeProve you’ve got their personality down pat with a vintage graphic tee you know they’ll love. Whether it’s a concert tee from their favorite musician or tour or a cult movie graphic, you’ll get points for rarity and personalization. It’s a foolproof pick: Even if it’s not their style, it can always be worn as a cozy, worn-in pajama top.Harry Styles Harry Styles Adore You T-Shirt, $, available at eBayA Vintage WatchA good-quality watch is the ultimate gift that lasts for decades. Shop secondhand for a significant discount and for the opportunity to snag a lusted-after vintage style, like an old-school Casio (to commemorate the watch’s 50th anniversary this year) or a Seiko classic. For a luxury option, see Cartier’s Tank watch, which continues to soar in popularity. Seiko Vintage Seìko Slim Tank, $, available at eBayRare, Limited-Edition SneakersThe secondhand market is a goldmine for sneakerheads. If you know they missed out on a designer collaboration or limited release that they’re still thinking about, they’ll be gobsmacked to unwrap The Ones That Got Away. Bear in mind, you may have to pay over retail price for a pair from a sold-out launch. Loewe x On Canvas Mesh Cloudventure Sneakers, $, available at FashionphileA Leather JacketSlouchy, oversized jackets are this season’s cool-girl outerwear must-have. Seek out a leather jacket, ranging from bombers to trench coats, to get the perfectly worn-in look that characterizes this trend (and only gets better with age).Vintage Leather Jacket, $, available at DepopA Preppy SweaterThe quality of secondhand sweaters often exceeds that of newer versions. A vintage, cashmere Ralph Lauren crewneck is a hot-ticket item this year (the brighter the better), with other sought-after collegiate-forward brands to consider including Benetton and Champion. Some fabrics to look for when buying sweaters secondhand are high-quality wools for warmth, thick cottons for durability, and natural fiber blends for breathability. Ralph Lauren Cashmere Sweater, $, available at Vestiaire CollectiveThe Perfect Winter Boots Gift them with a pair of cold-weather kicks like pre-loved Dr. Martens or, if your budget allows, Prada loafers. Come dreary January, they’ll actually look forward to dressing for winter and will think about you all season long. The best part: They likely won’t have to go through the painful process of breaking the Docs in.Dr Martens Leather Snow Boots, $, available at Vestiaire CollectiveDainty Vintage HeelsNothing says timeless elegance like a pair of vintage heels. For a gift that will never go out of style, look for ladylike silhouettes like slingbacks, kitten heels, or Mary Janes. Jimmy Choo Lace-Up Mules, $, available at eBayHandcrafted Jewelry There is no better gift than heirloom jewelry. For a designer option, look to vintage pieces from Elsa Peretti’s archive. Alternatively, you can source baubles made from repurposed materials, such as vintage coins, recycled metals, or antique charms. It is as personal as it gets.Colleen Toland Vintage Beaded Bracelet, $, available at EtsyAn Upcycled PieceSpeaking of repurposed materials, for a truly one-of-a-kind gift, consider an upcycled item, like a reworked top with a modern silhouette or a patchwork jacket made from vintage blankets. “With reworks, each garment is hand-sourced with love and re-engineered into its new design,” says Charley Keighley, who sells ruched button-downs and bubble skirts. Not only will you be keeping unwanted fabrics out of landfills but also supporting independent designers.Riodecorset Reworked Corset, $, available at EtsyCult Luxury Items: Chanel HeelsNothing says timeless elegance like a pair of Chanel heels.

Coach Vintage Hampton Bag, $, available at PoshmarkAccessories: A Cozy ScarfAn oversized scarf is a winter essential that’s far more fun to give (and receive) than to buy for yourself.

Popular secondhand options include brands like Acne Studios, Burberry, and Loewe.Acne Studios Fringe Wool Scarf, $, available at eBayClassic Vintage Finds: Limited-Edition SneakersThe secondhand market is a goldmine for sneakerheads.

    "title": "Is Lululemon's Viral Wristlet Better Than Its Famous Belt Bag? I Investigate",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/lululemon-dual-pouch-wristlet-review-49335470",
    "description": "These days, I'm adamant about removing as much baggage from my life as possible - both metaphorically and literally. I've long been a fan of Lululemon's cult-favorite Belt Bag because of its compact yet functional design, but I've recently been coveting something even smaller for my day-to-day activities - like gym-trips, running errands, or basically any other scenario where I'd prefer to carry as little as possible. Lo and behold, Lululemon is actually the genius behind yet another viral accessory that pairs the brand's signature, sporty aesthetic with a lightweight and easy-to-carry bag design. Enter: the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet ($49, originally $78). Chronically online folks (like myself) are likely all too familiar with this compact accessory, as it's become a mainstay on TikTok's \"For You\" page (and a go-to personal travel bag) for dozens of fashion editors and influencers alike. With all the hype surrounding this stylish pouch, I couldn't help but wonder if the accessory was really worth all of the internet craze, especially in light of the obsession surrounding its mid-size predecessor. Curious - and frankly looking for an excuse to spend my Lululemon gift card - I bought and tested the Dual Pouch Wristlet and sought to answer the many questions surrounding the accessory. Why is everyone so obsessed with Lululemon's Dual Pouch Wristlet? How much can you actually fit in the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet? Is there a better Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet dupe to shop online? I answer all of that, and more, ahead. How Was I Influenced to Buy the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet? Similar to most of my product buys these days, TikTok introduced and ultimately influenced me to purchase the Dual Pouch Wristlet. For months, I've seen users tout the accessory in videos and Instagram reels, all showing off the different ways that they use the pouch in their day-to-day lives. Some rave that it's their go-to gym bag because it holds their keys, Apple AirPods, and credit cards, all in one convenient place. Others swear it's the perfect bag alternative for travel because it eliminates the fear of pickpocketing thanks to its handheld design. @gabilemoine What should i put in the grey pouch?! Currently i havent put anything in there yet so maybe ill take that piece off for now but if theres something you think i should put in it let me know! #lululemon #lululemoncreator #lululemondualpouchwristlet @lululemon ♬ If It's Lovin That You Want (Sped Up) - Tazzy What I Like About the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet For me, the wristlet's customizable design is a huge part of its appeal. Both of the pouches are detachable from the product's main hook, meaning you can add or remove them as you like. I can also attach other items to the main hook, like my car keys or mace, so it's a great modular accessory for those who prefer something that they can easily make their own. The wristlet is also made from a 100 percent recycled nylon material that's sleek to the touch and relatively easy to keep clean; per the brand, you can simply spot clean it to remove any stains or dirt. Despite its compact design, the pouches can also hold quite a bit - including several credit cards, cash, a small lipstick, and anything else you'd like to keep handy. The actual wristlet is pretty open and stretchy, so you can comfortably wear it around your wrist without fear of skin irritation. And with a wide variety of tones and colorways (including new ones for fall), there are so many fun options to shop that feel totally unique to the traditional cardholder or wallet. What's Worth Noting My biggest qualm with this accessory is the lack of cardholder slots on the inside of the pouch. Prior to purchasing one of my own, I'd always assumed that the accessory would at least have one or two slots to keep items like credit cards or my driver's license secure, similar to the design of a traditional cardholder. While this doesn't affect the security of the piece - I still feel comfortable carrying around the accessory with items that I'd normally store in my wallet - I do think that having an extra interior slot or compartment would make all the difference in keeping items separated and thus easier to pull out whenever needed. Reviewers on Lululemon's site also noted that the light-colored variations tend to dirty faster than dark-colored ones, while others noted that the accessory's material frayed sooner than they expected. One reviewer wrote: \"Fabric frayed and hardware tarnished within first few months.\" I've had my pouch for a little less than a month and haven't noticed any significant wear and tear yet, but it's certainly something to be mindful of, given this product's higher price tag. Because several reviews cited issues with discoloration on shades like the white opal and flush pink colorway, I also chose to order mine in the classic black and traverse gray tones. If you want to avoid dirtying your bag too quickly, I recommend opting for one of the darker shades. Who Is the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet Best For? This wristlet is perfect for anyone who wants to cut back on their carrying capacity each day - without having to sacrifice on style in the process. The accessory has just enough space to hold the essentials, giving you the freedom to carry what you need and nothing more. Unlike traditional cardholders or clutches, it also has a durable design that'll hold up regardless of the weather or circumstance. It's the perfect embodiment of stylish functionality, and it's a great alternative for those who are tired of lugging around large accessories to the gym, while traveling, or even just running errands. Additional Details: Lululemon's Dual Pouch Wristlet is made from a durable, water-repellent fabric that's designed for on-the-go wear. Thanks to its hook design, the pouches are completely detachable, so you can customize the look and functionality of the accessory. It comes in eight different colorways, including black and traverse gray (my shades of choice), grey eucalyptus and bone, flush pink and bone, and nightfall and lilac ether, among others.

    "title": "12 Skims Bestsellers With Major Cyber Monday Markdowns",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/bestselling-skims-products-49378788",
    "description": "Skims went from an idea to an award-winning intimates and loungewear brand. Founded by Kim Kardashian as well as Emma and Jens Grede in 2019, the company was valued at $4 billion in July 2023, according to Forbes. Whether or not shoppers are Kardashian fans, the brand still seems to have go-to collections that continuously sell out. And many of those items are on sale for Cyber Monday. The Fits Everybody line is made with a signature stretch fabric that truly is butter-soft (in fact, I'm wearing the classic thong right now and I describe it as feeling like \"nothing.\" In other words, it's a second skin). The Soft Lounge launch gave way to everyone's favorite long slip dress, which most people attest to be the most flattering body-conscious piece they own. And the Seamless Sculpt range provides every piece of shapewear you could possibly imagine layering underneath that slightly skin-revealing look you've been trying to figure out how to style. And then there's the nipple push-up bra that turns heads whenever I wear it and is a major bestseller. Of course, Skims has been most notably praised for its sizing (XXS-4X) and incredible assortment of nude shades to complement skin tones. Its adaptive products feature added hook and eye closures and front clasps for accessibility, though the brand is overdue for introducing more styles. Nevertheless, if you're new to shopping Skims, we highly recommend you start with the top-rated picks that most folks rave about on social - and these 12 are it. Ahead, read up on the Skims bestsellers, many of which are on sale for Cyber Monday, and decide where to shop based on your color and size preferences. Skims is available at skims.com, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Net-a-Porter, Ssense, and more.",
