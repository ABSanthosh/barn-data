The 200 images from 80 photographers on show reflect its furious energy and explosive creative couplingsSPEED SEX GORE AGGRO promised a 1998 cover of the Face. The cover star was Alexander McQueen, looking like a revenant with blanched white skin and blood-red eyes. “He wanted to express the idea of the burning rage felt by Joan of Arc being burned at the stake,” the photographer Nick Knight recalls.In its initial run between 1980 and 2004, the cult style magazine served this kind of madness every month to its avid young readers. The Face even managed to make David Beckham dirty, with soy sauce and coffee dribbling down his abs. This exhibition is suitably splashy, and with more than 200 photographs by 80 photographers it convincingly demonstrates the publication’s influence and audacity. It is a riotous romp through two decades of British fashion, from New Romantics to Gothic Romantics, by way of grunge and a bit of medieval fantasy. Continue reading...",

Sweat sets are an MVP for curling up on chilly flights. Bonus: you can break up a set and wear each piece separately, unlocking endless mix-and-match potential for those moments when you actually want to plan an outfit.If you’re ready to retire those ratty, holey sweats that have seen you through college and countless days under your duvet (no judgment — we’ve all got that pair), consider yourself covered.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. It’s been a few seasons since Allison Bornstein’s wrong shoe theory — the idea that a surprising shoe choice can anchor a look — entered the social zeitgeist and took the fashion world by storm. While its intention was to encourage experimentation with footwear when the impetus strikes, there’s something about the upcoming crop of shoe trends that might have us calling on this nugget of sartorial wisdom on the regular.  The top styles emerging in 2025 offer an exciting look back on silhouettes we’d never thought would see a comeback. Case in point: the clunky-but-chic clogs revival (as seen at Chloé’s spring/summer 2025 show, as well as Hermès and Burberry runways), plus the improbable resurgence of the peep toe (ushered in by labels like Tory Burch, Miu Miu, and Acne) and the low-profile sneaker silhouette that’s finally unseated the Gazelle at Stella McCartney, Dior, and Loewe. So far, we have a healthy mix of polarizing, surprising and delightful, all at once. At the core of the styles that will define 2025, though, is function — after all, it’s reasonable to expect you’ll be able to walk in them, albeit not always comfortably. Ahead, 2025’s top shoe trends, plus the exact styles we’re eyeing.  2025 Shoe Trend: Peep Toe One of the more divisive shoes on the rise, the peep-toe heel is making its triumphant return. It almost feels inevitable: After years of an early-aughts revival with low-rise pants, baby tees and butterfly clips, the footwear silhouette is the banner style at Tory Burch, Miu Miu, Prada, Acne Studios and Copenhagen Fashion Week darling Remain; it’s also been worn by the likes of Addison Rae and Amal Clooney. One thing’s for sure: We’ll be seeing a lot more of it soon. 2025 Shoe Trend: Transparency Coming on the heels of quiet luxury, see-through shoes of all kinds are no longer just a Disney princess’ dream. Glass, lucite and otherwise transparent footwear is taking hold at Rabanne, Victoria Beckham, Giambattista Valli, and Gucci, the latter of which debuted a curved lucite wedge heel alongside its range of sneakers and loafers. Meanwhile, Brandon Maxwell’s iteration — a netted-upper flat — feels like a natural progression of the mesh shoe trend. 2025 Shoe Trend: Back-To-School Loafers How long does a style have to be relevant for its trend status to be revoked? Whatever it is, loafers are about a season away from cementing their status as a permanent, all-season favorite. This year’s take on the ever-chic shoe came in the form of platform brogues at Chanel, a cut-out iteration at Simone Rocha and two-tone Oxfords at Loewe. Willy Chavarria’s take boasts a knee-high sock, and there are still plenty of hosiery-and-loafer combinations that have yet to be seen. 2025 Shoe Trend: Boxing-Style Sneakers Some seasons tend to play to the fantastical, while others veer more practical. Adidas Gazelles have had more than a few seasons as the pragmatic sneaker du jour; now it’s time for something even more low-profile: the boxing sneaker.  The telltale marker of the tall sports shoe isn’t its lace-up ankle protection but rather its hyper-thin sole that allows for quick, agile feet. Labels like Miu Miu, Stella McCartney, Dior, Ann Demeulemeester, and Loewe all debuted similar, performance-minded styles. While those have yet to hit stores, Adidas reissued its Japan VH shoe, which also showed up at Caroline Hu’s spring 2025 presentation complete with floral embroidery and bow embellishments. Expect to see more and more similar styles crop up over the coming months. 2025 Shoe Trend: Reimagined Thong Sandals Brat summer ushered in many an unlikely trend but it also welcomed the resurgence of old favorites, like the ‘90s-era thong sandal. While Havaianas’ stock steadily rose, so did fashion’s interest in the easy-wearing, minimalist shoe. Designers like Tibi, Alaïa, Carven, and Sportmax reimagine the faithful silhouette — once marked by a foam sole and plastic upper — with a platform and triangle upper, each begging to find a home next to loose-fit suiting separates, pedal pushers or tiered maxi skirts. 2025 Shoe Trend: Nouveau Heel This trend lands right in the sweet spot between fantastical and practical. We’ve seen our fair share of nontraditional heels in seasons past but this year’s bunch feels even more creative. A bulbous, rock-hard clementine or a sleek, undulating wedge may seem like a bizarre (and squarely artful) thing to walk on but this new crop of heels often boasts a larger surface area, thereby increasing walkability. Tory Burch’s sculptural, curved heel made its way down the runway with ease, while Victoria Beckham’s chunky lucite heel is as sturdy as it is divine. 2025 Shoe Trend: Clogs A token of the bohemian aesthetic that took off in the early aughts around the same time Coachella became a household name, the lowly clog — which originated in 13th-century Amsterdam to protect the feet of farmers and workers — often gets a bad rap. These days, clogs take on a more towering, aesthetically grounded shape that, well, isn’t for everyone. Still, Chloé’s front-row stunt proved successful: Liya Kebede, Sienna Miller, Kiernan Shipka, Georgia May Jagger, and even Pat Cleveland showed up wearing the brand’s signature platform wedge clogs. Meanwhile, other labels like Burberry and Miu Miu put their own spin on the shoe. Resist the urge to wear them with a romantic, sweeping maxi and a wide-brimmed hat, and instead style them as you would a slingback for a truly modern take. 2025 Shoe Trend: All Tied Up Balletcore may be cooling off but something more romantic — and, dare we say, sexy — is bidding for its prime placement. Unapologetically chic, the tie-up shoe has its origins in the delicate trends that came before it. At Proenza Schouler, a round-toe sandal has strings that crisscross and gather at the ankle, while Ferragamo’s thong sandal-ballerina hybrid features true-to-form grosgrain ribbon up to the calf. Meanwhile, Ann Demeulemeester is holding onto the shoe’s ballet roots with a square-toe style laced up a thin-ribbed sock for a more performance-minded take. Like what you see?

    "title": "I Test Drove Taylor Swift's Date-Night Corsets at Fashion Week",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/taylor-swift-corset-outfits-review-49428844",
    "description": "If you are a Taylor Swift fan, or have a friend who's a Swiftie (who doesn't?), then you've probably heard she's been spotted on many outings with boyfriend Travis Kelce. So, it might not come as a surprise that her style has taken a romantic turn for date nights and Chiefs games alike. Swift appears to have a newfound affinity for corsetry, sporting both the Victoria's Secret Very Sexy Classic Silk Corset ($35, originally $100) and Fleur du Mal Long Sleeve Flared Corset Dress ($475) in recent history. As someone who's always been intrigued by her aesthetic - skater skirts and leggy co-ords seem to transcend time in Swift's wardrobe - I decided to try out both pieces by constructing inspired street style looks for New York Fashion Week. My goal was to deliver an honest review of her go-to pieces so I reported thoroughly on the features, comfortability, and versatility of both corset designs ahead. Read on to see how I employed Swift's most recognizable styling tricks to determine whether her outfits live up to the hype. Taylor Swift's Victoria's Secret Corset Image Source: PS Photography / Sarah Wasilak and David Eulitt/Getty Images About the Victoria's Secret Very Sexy Classic Silk Corset It comes in coconut white or black as part of a set with an adjustable thong panty. It's available in sizes XS-XL with DD cup size available in small and medium. The corset has boning throughout, front hook-and-eye closures, and an adjustable lace-up back. The straps are elastic and not adjustable. It's made of 100-percent silk with a 100-percent polyamide lining. It should be hand-washed. What I Like About the Victoria's Secret Very Sexy Classic Silk Corset There's no denying that this corset made me feel snatched. I actually can't recall the last time I strapped myself into a proper corset, but this one brought back all the fond memories. I think the satin feel gives this a very elevated look, whether or not you're styling it with clothes. I also really appreciated the flexibility of the elastic straps since the rest of the bodice is so firm and structured. Ultimately, it's the silky sheen that makes this corset Swift-certified for a Chiefs game - she teamed it with red Versace tweed separates, Versace Medusa boots, and a Versace Medusa bag to ideate luxury, along with a Louis Vuitton Tambour watch and ruby jewelry from David Yurman, Effy, and Retrouvaí. I employed the same styling tricks, albeit at a significantly lower price point, and even swiped on Swift's signature red lip using her go-to Ruby Woo shade by Mac. What to Consider Before Buying the Victoria's Secret Very Sexy Classic Silk Corset This corset is not for the faint of heart. It required my boyfriend's full attention as I was unable to tie it myself once I had it in place, and I had to fully loosen all the ribbons to get it over my head. You'll want to reserve at least 10 minutes for this process, and probably tap a friend or partner for help. While it felt firm and not necessarily uncomfortable once it was secured, some folks might describe the corset as restricting, particularly while sitting down. I wore it to a runway show and had it on for a total of about three hours. I definitely breathed an unmistakable sigh of relief when I took it off at the end of the night. Finally, it's important to note that this corset doesn't have adjustable straps, and it's on clearance, so you may want to go for another option (VS recommends the Dare to Dream Lace Strapless Corset and Geo Daisy Lace Deep-V Corset as alternatives) for either of those key reasons. Taylor Swift's Fleur du Mal Corset Dress Image Source: PS Photography / Sarah Wasilak and XNY/Star Max/GC Images About the Fleur du Mal Long Sleeve Flared Corset Dress The dress is available in both black and heather gray in sizes XS-L. The material is soft stretch jacquard with corset seaming throughout. It has a mockneck cut, flare skater skirt with a wavy trim, and exposed back zipper. The dress should be dry cleaned or hand-washed with cold water, then laid flat to dry. It's returnable for a full refund and comes with free shipping since it's over $175. What I Like About the Fleur du Mal Long Sleeve Flared Corset Dress It's hard to find one bad feature of this LBD that Swift wore for a night out with Travis Kelce over the holidays. It's extremely comfortable and you can feel the quality just by the weight of the piece when you're holding it up in front of you. Because of the corsetry woven throughout, the design is extremely flattering and smoothing. It's easy to see why Swift's stylist Joseph Cassell Falconer considered this to be a closet staple when he selected it for her. \"We work with her stylist and know she has a few Fleur du Mal pieces,\" founder Jennifer Zuccarini said. \"I think Fleur du Mal is a perfect fit for [Swift] because her style, similar to Fleur, is more feminine, fashion-forward, and often cheeky and flirty. Over the last couple of years, she seems more comfortable with herself and embracing her sensuality and individuality.\" (Swift also sported the label in her music videos for \"Lover\" and \"You Need To Calm Down.\") For date night, Swift wore the dress under Simkhai's embellished Gianni coat with a fringe Stella McCartney Falabella tiny tote bag, Christian Louboutin platform sandals, De Beers earrings, a Bonbonwhims necklace, and gold Cartier watch. I paid homage to the look with a similar Nasty Gal coat that's now sold out, a Stella McCartney Ryder bag to reflect her love for the designer, and Vivaia sock boots with fitting red soles. I even applied the same Ruby Woo lipstick and added Swift-inspired jewelry to round out the moment. What to Consider Before Buying the Fleur du Mal Long Sleeve Flared Corset Dress While this dress has all the details that comprise a wardrobe essential, it is on the expensive side for a black skater dress, comparatively speaking. If you have pets, make sure you have a lint roller on hand because the material also attracts hair. The Fleur du Mal team notes that the dress sold out as soon as Swift wore it, though it's back in stock now, so if you love it, add it to your cart ASAP. One final note? I own the dress in my regular size (XS), and while it's the perfect length, the sleeves almost feel like added compression - that doesn't bother me at all, but if you prefer a looser fit, my advice is to size up. Where to Buy Taylor Swift's Viral Corsets You can shop the Victoria's Secret Very Sexy Classic Silk Corset on the brand's website and the Fleur du Mal Black Sleeve Flared Corset Dress on the brand's website, or at Shopbop and Farfetch.
