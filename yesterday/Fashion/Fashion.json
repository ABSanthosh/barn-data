If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Cooler weather has finally arrived, which means it’s the perfect time to ready your seasonal wardrobe with some of the hottest trends for the season. Our bodies will shortly get swathed in fall jackets, cozy sweaters, and wide-leg jeans, but our feet are already crying out for trendy sneakers, chunky loafers, and cute boots for autumn.The biggest shoe trends for fall/winter 2024 are about as comfort-focused as we’ve ever seen, with perennial favorites like cowboy boots and over-the-knee boots making a major resurgence. There are also super-soft materials in the mix this season, like luxe suede, fuzzy shearling, and cushy puffer fabrics. Ahead, peep the best fall boots to slip into. We’ve rounded up a mix of everyday styles (for work and casual autumn activities) and occasion-specific footwear (for date nights and holiday parties). Whether you’re a comfort connoisseur who needs a slip-on shoe for errands or someone who wouldn’t be caught wearing a flat sole, there’s a new boot with your name on it to help you start the season on the right foot. DashDividers_1_500x100 Puffer Boots Part outdoor shoes, part slippers, puffer boots are the cozy style that will keep your feet extra warm throughout the fall and into the winter. Pick from an array of insulated and waterproof snow booties in sporty and lifestyle silhouettes. You can also take on the trend in heeled or platform styles that come with detachable puffer leg warmers for extra coverage (and utility). DashDividers_1_500x100 Thigh-High Boots Over-the-knee boots are a given in any fall shoe roundup. Taylor Swift has only cemented their eternal popularity, recently wearing burgundy Giuseppe Zanotti Frannie High Boots to a football game. Thigh-high boots make any outfit seasonally appropriate, especially if you show them off with on-trend bubble skirts or comfy leggings. Look out for classic suede, trendy denim, and dramatic leather styles, as well as ones with low kitten heels and sky-high stiletto heels. DashDividers_1_500x100 Suede Boots Suede boots will also always be a fall fashion must-have, and they’re already everywhere you look. You can find these luxe-looking shoes at nearly every footwear retailer, especially in knee-high form (with popular kitten heels) — though you can also find block-heel booties and flat ankle boots for more casual fall ‘fits. DashDividers_1_500x100 Animal Print Boots Much like leopard-print sneakers are proving to be extremely popular this fall, leopard-print boots are also coming for the footwear crown… as are every kind of animal-print boot, for that matter. From zebra-print boots popping up in fashion week street-style looks and textured snakeskin boots making a comeback, you can (and should) go wild with your footwear this season. Take it a step further by trying more obscure giraffe-print and cow-print boots (perfect for your cowgirl Halloween costume). DashDividers_1_500x100 Western Boots Buckle up as we ride off into fall with the Western trend. Thanks to Beyonce’s Cowboy Carter, Bella Hadid’s adorable equestrian romance, and Kacey Musgraves’ new horse-girl inspired Reformation collaboration, cowboy boots — which have been back — are showing no sign of dosey-doeing away. From tried-and-true leather knee-high styles to kitschy metallic ankle-grazing ones, Western boots can be as “yeehaw” or as fashion-forward as your heart desires. DashDividers_1_500x100 Furry Boots Back in February, plush clothing made an impactful impression at the NYFW Fall/Winter 2024 shows, as did furry shoes. (The latter first gained traction in 2023, and continues strong for autumn.) Hop on the (definitely cute, possibly divisive) trend with a pair of cozy shearling booties for everyday activities or chic faux-fur stiletto boots for stylish parties. Like what you see?

    "description": "When finding the perfect pair of work shoes, style ranks high on our wish lists but, naturally, so does comfort. From the subway to the office to after-work cocktails with your friends and beyond, these are the shoes you'll practically be living in daily, so it's important to shop for a pair that'll keep you feeling comfortable, supported, and chic. Ahead, we curated a list of this season's best and most comfortable work shoes for women, from slingback heels and black flats to business-casual shoes that can meet any office's dress-code requirements. Most importantly, they all have one thing in common: they'll become your go-to everyday pair. Depending on your job or daily journey, your comfort (and commute) requirements might have different needs. If you work in a more dressed-up environment with a walking commute, opt for classic, comfortable flats that you can wear with trousers. If your workplace is more casual and you drive, you can probably get away with wearing a pair of heels to spice things up. And, of course, we also made sure to include some versatile sneakers that pair well with all clothing items - and are even favorites of our own editors. Keep reading for our complete guide to the best women's work shoes. With styles from brands like Old Navy, Rothy's, and Everlane, there's something at every price point and markdown.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/victorias-secret-fashion-show-outfit-lace-catsuit-49402984",
    "description": "When I pulled out my Victoria's Secret Fashion Show getting-ready outfit from the shopping bag delivered to my doorstep, I was stoked. To be honest, I'd always wondered what it felt like to be one of the Angels getting her makeup done backstage in the brand's signature Satin Short Piped Robe ($60). Mine even came with the official VS merch emblem emblazoned in crystals on the back. Both the crystals and the matching baseball cap (which is sadly now sold out from the \"Shop the Show\" drop) made up for the fact that I had to do my own makeup before trekking it to Brooklyn's Duggal Greenhouse for the return of the legendary VS runway. Still, it was the outfit I slipped on after wearing the pink robe, the one I would ultimately wear to the show, that made me the most nervous: the Very Sexy Rose Lace Balconette Catsuit ($130). It was far more daring than the loungewear I had been sporting before, and I nearly put my foot in my mouth when I saw just how see-through the material actually was. As it would turn out, model and former First Lady of France Carla Bruni wore the very same design on the runway as I looked on from my seat in the audience, admiring her confidence. Suddenly, I didn't feel so eager to cover up in my oversize denim jacket anymore. In fact, seeing what my fellow showgoers were wearing also made me feel more liberated in my lingerie as we all watched a VS Fashion Show that was more body inclusive than ever before. Don't get me wrong: the brand still has a long way to go, in my opinion - viewers all over the world expressed that same sentiment after the spectacle wrapped - but getting to wear lingerie that's typically reserved for Angels made the runway fashion feel more accessible. Ahead, learn how I styled the VS Very Sexy Rose Lace Balconette Catsuit, worn by Bruni, and read my full review of the piece, which is still shoppable online. Carla Bruni on the Victoria's Secret Runway Image Source: Getty / TheStewartofNY/FilmMagic Bruni, who celebrated getting her wings ahead of the show, wore the VS Very Sexy Rose Lace Balconette Catsuit with the Lace Lightly Lined Demi Bra and the Twinkle Strap Lace Corset Set. Her shimmering beaded wings, chunky stone hoops, and wraparound sparkling stilettos amplified the glitzy boning on her top, with the catsuit itself acting as the foundation of her whole look. How to Style a Lace Catsuit As the wing-less spectator I am, I felt it appropriate to layer with an oversize denim jacket from Frame and opted for simple black pumps. I kept on my hat to add a sporty twist. Underneath, I was rocking the VS Shine Patch Lightly Lined Wireless Bra ($45) and VS Logo Cotton Shine Patch Hiphugger Panty ($15), a bra and underwear set I highly recommend for anyone who who prefers just a touch of glamour but favors comfort above all else. The wireless bra felt so smooth and lightweight, whereas the panties provided just enough coverage underneath the stocking-like bodysuit, without adding bulk. Victoria's Secret Very Sexy Rose Lace Balconette Catsuit Review As time went on, I grew to appreciate the catsuit more and more - and not just because I was inspired by Bruni's confidence. It really does have a stretchy feel to it so that it fits like a second skin. I also appreciate design details such as the illusion front panty panel and vertical front seams, which add undeniable sex appeal but sophistication all the same. The back zipper is also easy to maneuver without any help; and from a style perspective, it really does look good with a pair of heels, regardless of how many layers you add up top. My only gripe is that the sweetheart neckline is very low cut and the chest area is wide open, so if you want to layer a bra beneath the built-in cups, it will definitely be visible and may not align exactly how you pictured it. My advice is to try it with a few different bra and panty sets underneath until you find the perfect match for your shape. Of course, just like with a pair of tights, you'll want to pull up this bodysuit carefully because the lace embroidery is definitely delicate. Additional Details About the Victoria's Secret Very Sexy Rose Lace Balconette Catsuit The catsuit comes in sizes XS-XXL. I took my usual size, XS. It's unlined and partially made from recycled materials, including recycled polyamide and recycled elastane. Since there's no back coverage, you will see your bra band from behind (and it'll likely peek out in the front, too). The catsuit is hand wash only. Rating:",
