    "description": "Designer Maria Grazia Chiuri borrows from Dorothea Tanning’s surrealist paintings for her runway showThe new year has its first new muse: “Punk Alice”. At Dior’s haute couture show in Paris, Lewis Carroll’s feisty heroine got a 21st-century makeover. Imagine Alice, she of Wonderland fame, but in her Charli xcx-inspired Brat era and with a wardrobe handmade by the finest seamstresses in Paris. There you start to get the picture.A snowy white cross-backed lace pinafore dress was worn with a quivering black silk mohican headdress. Alice’s striped stockings were reimagined as lace-up leather gladiator boots. Her frothy skirt became a birdcage crinoline, her girlish ribbons were knotted dog collar-tight at the throat. In the front row, Pamela Anderson smiled beneath a dotted black veil and Venus Williams was resplendent in tightly coiled braids. A fantastical landscape featuring lions in feather headdresses and plants that sprouted eyes as well as blooms was embroidered all over the walls, a stage set in the garden of the Musée Rodin.

    "description": "Fashion industry cosying up to new president over fears his ire – and tariffs – could snip profits, critics claimDonald Trump’s second presidency has sent shockwaves across industries since Monday – and fashion is no different. If, on the surface at least, the culture around fashion tends to skew centre left, this is is also ultimately a business about making money, and that means keeping the powerful onside.Major players showed their true colours last week. Among the tech billionaires and surprise celebrities at Trump’s inauguration was Bernard Arnault, the CEO of fashion conglomerate LVMH, with two of his children, Delphine and Alexandre. Trump’s daughter Ivanka, meanwhile, wore LVMH brand Dior, while Usha Vance (wife of JD) went for Oscar de la Renta. Though new first lady Melania wore relatively unknown designer Adam Lippes, her stylist Hervé Pierre told Women’s Wear Daily that more brands are now keen to dress her for the publicity, compared with the last time she was in the White House.

    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find the best things to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now.Stepping into a new year can often feel like you’re a bear who’s woken up halfway through hibernation. Thankfully, 2025 has plenty of glamorous occasions to keep us entertained as we shake off the shock, dust off our laptops, and jump back into the grind. The Golden Globes kicked off awards season with a long list of fashion and beauty knockout moments. Our favorites of the night were Ayo Edebiri’s ‘90s Julia Roberts-inspired gray Loewe suit, Zendaya’s burnt orange satin Louis Vuitton gown, and Kylie Jenner’s direct homage to Elizabeth Hurley’s backless Versace number, which really got the people talking. While our gaze is fixed on the red carpet for more amazing looks as the season ramps up, we’re also keeping an eye on the exciting launches happening in the fashion and beauty space this month. From a new Fenty Skin cleanser to a Louis Vuitton collaboration, click through to see all the new goodies heading your way this January.H\u0026M Studio’s Pre-Spring CapsuleDesigned with transitional dressing and warmer days in mind, H\u0026M Studio’s Pre-Spring Capsule collection features tailored wardrobe essentials with flowing fabrics and voluminous silhouettes — think a long collarless coat, an oversized leather jacket, a sleek black trench made with a windbreaker-type fabric, a wrap-around miniskirt and more. Pieces are available in a black and midnight blue color palette, while a yellow and purple crocus — one of the first blooms of spring — print is also available on a pair of leggings and handkerchief-hem maxi dress. Shop at hm.com on January 30Marine Serre x RepettoBalletcore is lingering for a little bit longer, thanks to the  Marine Serre x Repetto collaboration. The partnership between the two French brands infuses the former’s modern aesthetics with the latter’s classic dance style. (Repetto was founded in 1947 as a ballet shoe company.) The result is two shoe styles: the leather Lilouh flat, embossed with Serre’s signature crescent moon on the toe, and the Camille ballerina, which features a 1-inch block heel and is available in denim, black, white, and fire red moon prints. “As a child, I was captivated by the elegant style of Repetto ballerinas,” Serre said, in a press release. “On top of that, they were crafted near my home in Saint Médard d’Excideuil. For my sister and I, it was magical to visit this factory, which introduced us to the world of craftsmanship.”Shop now at repetto.com Repetto x Marine Serre Lilouh Ballet Flats, $, available at RepettoLouis Vuitton x Murakami Re-Edition CollectionWith Zendaya fronting the campaign, Louis Vuitton is straight out of the gate with the collaboration of the year. Twenty years after its first collection with Japanese artist Takashi Murakami, the French luxury house is back with an internet-breaking re-edition.

Now, the two have reunited with a limited-edition collection of lingerie and loungewear. The Araks x J.Crew capsule features a range of underwear and sleepwear featuring bold colors and elegant design details — think ice blue cotton-silk embroidered pajamas, berry-tinted bralettes, and a color-blocked slip dress with scalloped trims. “The pieces are both effortless and considered, chic without trying too hard,” Yeramyan said of the collab. “These are the clothes you’ll reach for without thinking, yet always feel good in.

The only question we have is: How has it taken this long for the two London-based brands to join forces? The Rixo x Stripe \u0026 Stare features must-have essentials (different cuts of underwear, camisoles, bodysuits, and even baby tees) in covetable and cutesy patterns — such as heart- and leopard-prints and florals — and a pair of briefs with the phrase “forget me not” etched across them.

The nine-piece collection includes pieces like a denim trucker jacket with detachable zip detailing (a reference to Undercover’s fall/winter 1998 collection), a pair of 501 jeans with an embroidered zigzag pattern, and apparel with archival Undercover graphics. Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea stars in the campaign to promote the new drop. Shop at Levi’s on January 18 Jenny Bird Love CollectionValentine’s Day is just around the corner, meaning we’re allowed to continue buying gifts for others (and ourselves). Toronto-based jewelry designer Jenny Bird is keeping things classic with an array of heart-shaped accessories including a padlock heart pendant necklace, heart button studs, and a gold ring adorned with a dangling heart charm. Our favorites have to be the subtle heart puff earrings, which appear sculptural from the front and more abstract from the side view — perfect for the lovergirls who like to keep things on the down-low. Shop at Jenny BirdXO, Kitty x Good Light CosmeticsFor the rom-com lovers among us, the return of To All The Boys spinoff XO, Kitty is a welcome distraction from the miserable January weather.

The kit’s main gem is the Multi-Peptide Lip Nectar, a non-sticky lip hydrator with ingredients including lychee, vitamin C, glycerin, and yuzu seed peptide.

    "description": "When it comes to fashion, whether you're minimalist, maximalist, or something entirely in between, there's one staple item you need in your wardrobe: a leather jacket. It's truly the Swiss army knife of clothing. There are plenty of different styles to choose from, including oversize, cropped, and motorcycle - just to name a few. You can dress it up or down, and whether you're wearing it for a date or throwing it on for a quick grocery store run, there's nothing like a well-worn leather jacket that is perfectly you. However, finding a high-quality leather jacket at a price that won't break the bank is no easy feat. Luckily, we think we found a brand that checks all of our boxes and has something for everyone, no matter what style you're seeking. Allow us to introduce you to Quince. Quince is all about offering high-quality items made with premium materials at an affordable price. How do they do it? The direct-to-consumer brand uses a factory-direct model and keeps costs low by cutting out the supply-chain middlemen. They make home and travel products, but right now, our editors couldn't be more obsessed with their leather jackets. Ahead, three editors put three different styles of Quince's 100-percent leather jackets to the test. You can check us out modeling different options, read about how they worked for us, and then use our tips to help you make your own purchase - we promise you won't regret it. Keep scrolling to read our honest thoughts.",
