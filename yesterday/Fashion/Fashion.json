It’s also a white T-shirt.

Customers are measured and quizzed on tweaks – you can change the fabric, the stitching, arm and hip lengths.

    "description": "Don’t write them off as just another step in your routine: primers can make a huge difference to whatever goes on topI never really thought that primers would form a significant part of my makeup ritual. For me, primers were simply another step I just didn’t have time for. And so I skipped it. To my peril. What I have long realised is that a decent primer is imperative to the (quality) finish of your makeup. It creates an even, blurring and hydrating base for everything that follows. This means, fundamentally, you avoid everything on your face sliding around before you’ve made it down the street. Putting on makeup without a primer is a bit like painting over layers of wallpaper. You think it looks OK. Then you compare it to a wall that has been skimmed, cleaned and primed before being painted. And you get an aha moment. There’s no comparing the two. However, I do understand why, aside from the time factor, tons of people don’t use primers. Historically, the textures and formulations have been a bit gunky and ironically just didn’t work well with foundations, leaving a piling effect. These days the choice is better and much more wide-ranging – textures (powders, sprays, balms) and also finishes, to meet all needs (blurring, mattifying, glowing). Which means you no longer need to worry about your primer making your face look like a bobbly old jumper.1. Refy Blur and Hydrate Primer £24, refybeauty.com 2.

    "description": "When finding the perfect pair of work shoes, style ranks high on our wish lists but, naturally, so does comfort. From the subway to the office to after-work cocktails with your friends and beyond, these are the shoes you'll practically be living in daily, so it's important to shop for a pair that'll keep you feeling comfortable, supported, and chic. Ahead, we curated a list of this season's best and most comfortable work shoes for women, from slingback heels and black flats to business-casual shoes that can meet any office's dress-code requirements. Most importantly, they all have one thing in common: they'll become your go-to everyday pair. Depending on your job or daily journey, your comfort (and commute) requirements might have different needs. If you work in a more dressed-up environment with a walking commute, opt for classic, comfortable flats that you can wear with trousers. If your workplace is more casual and you drive, you can probably get away with wearing a pair of heels to spice things up. And, of course, we also made sure to include some versatile sneakers that pair well with all clothing items - and are even favorites of our own editors. Keep reading for our complete guide to the best women's work shoes. With styles from brands like Old Navy, Rothy's, and Everlane, there's something at every price point and markdown.
