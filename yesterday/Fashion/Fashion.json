    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/revenge-dress-celebrities-49136376",
    "description": "Princess Diana in an off-shoulder minidress when Prince Charles went public with his affair. Mariah Carey in a hip-high slit after leaving a tumultuous marriage. Ariana Madix in a fiery-red cutout set in the wake of #Scandoval. And most recently, Huda Mustafa in a black mini lace cutout frock after being dumped by Jeremiah Brown on \"Love Island USA.\" The revenge dress isn't a new phenomenon, but it remains at the forefront of everyone's minds. Inspired by the black mini worn by the Princess of Wales in the 1990s, the modern revenge dress is fashion at its most communicative. It's bold, fitted in silhouette, and red or black in color. It boasts plunging necklines and conspicuous cutouts, high splits and open backs. It's a comeback story, rendered sartorially. Despite the revenge dress's enduring legacy, I always felt uneasy about it. How vengeful is a sultry dress anyway? A better act of revenge would be, well, cheating back, as Chloe Bailey sings. What's more, the concept of \"revenge dressing\" frames a woman's wardrobe and appearance as her primary weapons of power. What about revenge accomplishments? Revenge art? Revenge careers? Why is it that - after a woman's been wronged - the statement that really makes an impact revolves around how she looks? I also wasn't sold on the idea of dressing with the offending party in mind. Fashion is such a personal, intimate act for me; I get dressed based on my mood, my desires, my social calendar for the week. I don't want that process to be hijacked by someone else, let alone someone who caused me harm. \"[...] there's something empowering about the revenge dress. It speaks to the confidence of a woman who knows that her value goes far beyond how she was treated. But I learned - through experience - that there's something empowering about the revenge dress. It speaks to the confidence of a woman who knows that her value goes far beyond how she was treated. My revenge dress story is pretty typical. Three years ago, pre-pandemic, I found myself on the verge of a break up. We had been so in sync; we had amazing chemistry; we saw a future together with kids, pets, and even a few business ventures. But when I signed into his Netflix account, of all things, I saw a newly-created profile bearing another woman's name - someone he'd visited once to help her fix a broken water pipe, allegedly. I inquired about it, and our relationship quickly unraveled from there. He was belligerent and I was crushed. And the New Year's Eve party invite I had accepted a few days prior hung in the balance. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jessica C. Andrews (@dressupwithjess) I was not in the mood to dress up and be around people. But then I reconsidered; after all, I usually enjoy a night of revelry and I refused to let him take that away from me. I landed on a dress that encapsulated that mood perfectly. A sequin micro mini with exaggerated sleeves and a plunging neckline. It was just the boost I needed to feel like myself again. It's the same energy Tina Turner emanated when she stepped out in 1986 after leaving her abusive marriage. She donned a skin-tight leather Azzedine Alaïa gown with four cutouts down the side, her hair in a blonde spiky mullet. Becky G had a similar air of confidence as she posed in a black lace dress at the iHeartRadio Music Awards - on the same day her fiancé addressed cheating rumors. And even more recently, Mustafa wore a series of curve-hugging dresses after her match (Brown) traded her for a new bombshell on national television. Dressing for revenge is less about retaliation, and more a bold declaration of self-love. It's putting on a brave face and a tight, cutout dress - and letting the world know that what happened to you didn't break you and will not define you. Keep scrolling to glean your own confidence from the best celebrity revenge moments of all time, from Princess Diana to Ariana Madix - and shop similar dresses to Mustafa's ensembles from the cult-favorite series.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/kylie-jenner-sunglasses-lauren-sanchez-wedding-49449673",
    "description": "Leave it to Kylie Jenner to have all eyes on her at a wedding that's not hers. Most recently, the Khy founder joined her sisters (Kendall Jenner and Kim Kardashian) and mom Kris Jenner at one of the most anticipated matrimonies of the year: Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez's wedding in Venice, Italy. Naturally, Kylie Jenner didn't hold back when it came to her looks for the three-day extravaganza - from a white-silver lingerie dress to a cleavage-baring black string bikini. As if showing up in a white dress to someone else's nuptials wasn't already an indicator, Jenner further cemented her role as the main character wedding guest with a classic yet commanding accessory - black sunglasses from Otra Eyewear. It was the perfect example of a fashion faux pas that paid off. The Gen Z entrepreneur wore the Kenny sunglasses from the Spanish brand, which is set to be available as part of an upcoming collaboration with the Grandquist sisters launching later this summer on the label's site and Revolve. Of course Jenner gets first dibs on the unreleased item, but that doesn't mean you can't get the same vibe. The site offers other budget-friendly picks like the Otra Hazel Black Sunglasses ($65) and the Otra Ivy Black Sunglasses ($65) - both cat-eye frames that are ideal for everyday wear (or a wedding if you're a Jenner/Kardashian). Since I'm a shopping-obsessed editor and self-proclaimed sunglasses connoisseur, Jenner's accessory of choice piqued my interest. I found these similar options that are Kylie Jenner coded, and even more affordable. For the committed minimalist, consider these black frames that are sure to elevate your summer looks: the Aire Fornax 53mm Oval Sunglasses ($44) and the Le Specs Dream Lover 50mm Cat Eye Sunglasses ($85). And of course, Amazon has pieces that are just as chic and Bezos wedding-worthy, like the YMFRW Retro Cat Eye Sunglasses ($8, originally $15) and the Vanlinker Small Polarized Cat Eye Sunglasses ($14). Naomi Parris is the assistant shopping editor at PS, based in New York. With over eight years of experience and previous roles held on the brand's Beauty and Operations teams, she enjoys telling stories that merge fashion, beauty, and Black culture. Naomi has also lent her skillful pen to Essence Girls United, Elle, Bustle, and Elite Daily. When she's not crafting shopping roundups, high-profile features, beauty op-eds, or trend guides, you can find Naomi behind her blog \"Eli-Nay,\" where she inspires readers through style guides, cultural pieces, and innovative content on her Instagram.",
