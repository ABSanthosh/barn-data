    "description": "Trump is back in office, shame is seemingly out and greed is in – with conspicuous consumerism on the catwalks and beyond. Look around and you could be back in 1987 ...The first time I heard the phrase “boom boom” was at a fashion show in January: Prada in Milan. While I sat waiting for something incredibly tasteful to appear on the catwalk, out marched a bare-chested model with a pashmina-sized fur draped over his shoulders. Then came another, and another, and then one more in a huge fur hood. The fur was shearling – skin from a recently shorn sheep or lamb; usually, as in Prada’s case, a byproduct of the meat industry, so marginally less problematic – but still. You see some strange things on catwalks these days, but “fur” isn’t usually one of them.Except it didn’t stop there. Later, there was “fur” at Emporio Armani and yeti coats at Dolce \u0026 Gabbana. By the time the womenswear shows had finished in March, “fur” (mostly fake, occasionally real) had appeared in about 70% of the shows. Along with that were exaggerated shoulders at Saint Laurent, Pretty Woman thigh-high boots at Stella McCartney and pointy bras at Miu Miu. These shows seemed to be saying that fashion wants us to look rich, gauche and glamorous. Or, to use a phrase coined by the trend forecaster Sean Monahan, who gave the world normcore (2014) and vibe shift (2022), fashion wants us to look boom boom. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Sliced and spliced, this season the classic coat has been reimagined way beyond its battlefield origins. Earlier this week, a TikTok video of fashion influencers went viral. Shot by the Dutch content creator Benthe Liem, the short clip features half a dozen women wearing roughly the same style of beige trenchcoat, presumably gifted to them by the brand hosting trip. Liem entitled the video, which has so far been viewed over 1.6m times: “When you think you are very unique (influencer trip edition).”However, a quick jaunt down the high street is now akin to stepping into a real-life version of that clip. Here we are, only a couple of days into spring, and the trenchcoat has already become ubiquitous. Continue reading...",

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. From The White Lotus to Summer House, it’s hard to miss all the warm-weather and vacation-ready fashion on our screens. And they’re inspiring us to upgrade our own spring wardrobes, especially while many of us are in the midst of annual closet cleanouts. So if you’re realizing that you may need a spring dress (or two) to round out your spring outfits, look no further than the trends taking over the season.There are plenty of styles (many of which we saw during Paris Fashion Week’s recent season) worth experimenting with this season. Think everything from nostalgic bubble hems and playful drop waists to joyful butter yellow and chic polka dots. So whether you’re in need of an everyday must-have to wear to the office and on dates this spring, or special-occasion dresses for weddings and holidays, take inspiration from the trending styles below. DashDividers_1_500x100 Butter Yellow Dresses After its surge in popularity last year, butter yellow is back again this warm-weather season. That’s especially evident in the spring dress lineups from our favorite brands. Pick from casual minis and milkmaid dresses (yes, they are still having a moment), versatile midis, and tried-and-true maxi slip dresses for every type of occasion, from Easter to Mother’s Day and wedding season.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Bubble Hem Dresses As whimsical as it is versatile, the bubble hem provides a maximalist (yet still wearable), nostalgic touch to dresses currently on the market. While bubble hem skirts have had their time in the spotlight the last few seasons, we’re looking at full-blown bubble hem dresses now. And since they’re predicted to be a defining trend of 2025, there’s no better time than right now to try it out. For spring, look out for warm-weather-approved fabrics, like cotton poplin and details like smocked bodices.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Polka Dot Dresses Whether you want to channel Julia Roberts’ brown horse race ensemble in Pretty Woman, or Marilyn Monroe’s white number in The Seven Year Itch, throw on a polka dot dress to create your own cinematic look. This spring, stick to classic black-and-white color palettes for a timeless look or try pops of pinks (or neutrals like navy and brown) for a more youthful take on the print. DashDividers_1_500x100 Drop-Waist Dresses Drop-waist dresses started trickling in last year when the European summer aesthetic was all the rage. Luckily, they’re not going anywhere this season — and can be found on a wide range of styles, from denim midis to taffeta-like gowns. For more modern iterations of the ’20s look, look to V-shape waists and dipped hip details rather than harsh hip cutoffs and solid hues.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Floral Dresses Yes, florals consistently re-emerge as a favorite every spring, but it’s impossible to ignore the bold floral dresses that are being scooped up by shoppers this season. Whether the print is small or large, opt for vibrant pinks, blues, and yellows that contrast the dress’ overall hue (ex: black, white, and cream). Additionally, look out for more unexpected flowers like sunflowers and hydrangeas for a twist. DashDividers_1_500x100 Lace Dresses Lace may feel most appropriate for formal weddingwear… or lingerie, but we’re here to prove that the dainty, elegant fabric can be incorporated into your everyday looks, too. Consider pieces with hints of lace on trims and appliqués rather than full lace designs See: T-shirt dresses (or sophisticated slips) with lace skirts that add a pop of interest but certainly don’t feel too conservative or matronly.  Like what you see?

    "description": "I've got a wedding-heavy summer ahead, so much so that I now consider myself an expert bridesmaid. However, as many of us know, bridesmaid duties come with hefty costs. While I'd do almost anything for my friends, going into debt isn't one of them. That's why I've been savvy about cutting costs, especially when it comes to my wedding shoes. I'm wearing the same pair to all three weddings on my calendar, namely the Dream Pairs Open Toe Pump Chunky Heel Sandals ($29, originally $36). I virtually stumbled upon them while working on a story about the best summer shoes on Amazon, and I was immediately intrigued since they hold the number one spot among all women's heeled sandals. Given their popularity, and the fact that the brand Dream Pairs happens to also make some of the most comfortable Western boots I've ever owned (these ones!), I decided they'd be a safe bet for my weddings. I scooped them up in my usual size 9.5 in a light beige color I knew would match all of my bridesmaid dresses - and that was one of the smartest decisions I've made this summer. Ahead, I break down everything you need to know about them if you're considering buying them for a special event, too. What I Like About the Dream Pairs Open Toe Pump Chunky Heel Sandals At the time of writing, I've already worn the Dream Pairs Open Toe Pump Chunky Heel Sandals to two of my three summer weddings. I'll admit, when everyone was showing off their designer shoes before the ceremony at the first wedding, I stayed quiet since I spent practically nothing on mine. But then I couldn't help but smile when I was the only bridesmaid who kept my shoes on for the entire reception. They were comfortable enough and stable. Even though the unhemmed dress I wore gave me some trouble walking down the aisle (totally my fault), my shoes kept me upright. Their chunky, stable block heel held up perfectly, even on the wet grass from a rainstorm earlier that day. Beyond their comfort, they looked the part, too, which I'd like to think is evidenced in this mirror selfie I snapped at the second wedding while the bride lounged behind me. (I'm wearing the Azazie Barbie Pleated Chiffon A-Line Dress in Champagne, BTW, and felt like a princess.) I chose the light beige color (one of 58 total styles and colors to choose from) because I knew they'd go with everything. Plus, I figured that if they survived all three weddings, the versatile shade would make them perfect for future special events. Despite wearing them through two ceremonies, two receptions, and hours of questionable moves on the dance floor, they're still in pristine shape for my final summer wedding in a few weeks. What's Worth Noting About the Dream Pairs Open Toe Pump Chunky Heel Sandals These sandals are not the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn, which, to be honest, I kind of expected given their price tag. The buckle at the ankle dug into my skin a bit at the first wedding, but in retrospect, I'm confident that was a user error from securing them as tight as possible to prevent a walk-down-the-aisle stumble. I was still able to wear them all night, which is more than I can say for some of the pricier heels I own. At the second wedding I didn't secure the strap as tightly and found they were comfortable from the time I slipped them on at 3 p.m. until 11:30 p.m. post-ceremony. No blisters, no blood, no regret. Another thing worth noting is that shoppers seem a bit conflicted over the fit. I hover between sizes 9.5 and 10, and since multiple shoppers noted that they run big, I went for the 9.5 and found they were a perfect fit. Many reviewers suggest ordering a half size down, which made sense for me, but a handful of others found that sizing down made them too small. So, if you're ordering them on Amazon without much time to spare, it might be worth ordering two sizes to find your ideal fit and returning the pair that doesn't work. Who Are the Dream Pairs Open Toe Pump Chunky Heel Sandals Best For? The Dream Pairs Open Toe Pump Chunky Heel Sandals are perfect for those looking for a reasonably priced, comfortable, and versatile pair of heels for a special event. While they might not be the most comfortable shoes in the world, they're the number one bestseller on Amazon in women's heeled sandals for plenty of other reasons. They've checked a big box off my summer wedding wardrobe checklist and will suit you well for any event where you need a timeless heel. Where Are the Dream Pairs Open Toe Pump Chunky Heel Sandals Available to Shop? I purchased the Dream Pairs Open Toe Pump Chunky Heel Sandals on Amazon, where they are marked dowon for the Big Spring Sale. They're also available on the brand's website. Additional Details The Dream Pairs Open Toe Pump Chunky Heel Sandals come in a total of 58 colors and styles. They have a three-inch block heel. They're available for fast shipping with Amazon Prime.
