We all leaned into it back in lockdown, and with today’s barrage of terrifying news, it’s unsurprising we still feel in need of extra TLC.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/spanx-sculpting-jeans-review-49438249",
    "description": "Booty-lifting clothing and butt-enhancing shapewear are having a moment, which is why Spanx's introduction of its SpanxSculpt ReDefine denim is hardly a surprise. The renowned brand has been perfecting smoothing undergarments since 2000 under founder Sara Blakely's lead, and it's only expanding further. While Spanx has been producing pull-on denim for several years, SpanxSculpt ReDefine takes things to the next level - the material is constructed to actively enhance the natural shape while delivering the look of traditional denim. \"The combination of sculpting technology and classic denim detailing has driven incredible excitement and strong customer engagement,\" Spanx Chief Merchandising Officer Kiana Miree says. \"It's clear that this collection is becoming an essential wardrobe piece for so many, thanks to its perfect blend of shape-enhancing benefits and incredible comfort.\" The line launched with two silhouettes, the SpanxSculpt ReDefine Flare Jeans ($158), which I'm wearing in Dark Indigo, and the SpanxSculpt ReDefine Slim Straight Jeans ($158). Miree says it's an equal 50/50 split in popularity based on different customer preferences, but the darker wash reigns supreme. \"The flare style creates a leg-lengthening, shape-enhancing silhouette, while the slim straight style creates a figure-flattering leg shape that we obsessed to get just right,\" she says, confirming that the company is actively looking to expand even further into new styles and washes that align with upcoming trends. While I'm not necessarily in the market for a bigger butt, I'm not opposed to a little rounding and shaping - which is exactly why I was down to try out these jeans. Ahead, you can compare my figure in before-and-after photos and read a full and thorough review of Spanx's latest viral product that has the internet in a frenzy. Expert Featured in This Article Kiana Miree is the chief merchandising officer at Spanx. About the SpanxSculpt ReDefine Flare Jeans The jeans are available in Dark Indigo (the more popular shade according to the brand) and Medium Indigo with a regular inseam of 32\", which is described as \"slightly long.\" Available in sizes 0 to 26, the jeans run small due to their strong compression and LYCRA FitSense® denim technology; check out the size chart and take accurate measurements before purchasing. They have a five-pocket design with a zip and button closure and targeted, integrated sculpting zones for tummy control, thigh shaping, and a booty-lifting effect. The jeans are designed to be snug - they're in the right place when you can feel the sculpting zones at the upper thigh lifting your booty. The jeans have a high-rise at 11.5 inches and the flare leg opening is 21 inches. Machine wash on a cold, gentle cycle with like colors and tumble dry on low; do not iron, steam, or dry clean. Spanx offers free returns or exchanges on these jeans, and your purchase can be financed with four interest-free installments. A side view in standard denim flares vs. the SpanxSculpt ReDefine jeans. What I Like About the SpanxSculpt ReDefine Flare Jeans These jeans definitely do their job to enhance, ultimately making my backside appear a lot rounder than I'm used to when I'm wearing regular denim. \"The best feedback we've heard is, 'Wow, my butt has never looked this lifted,'\" Miree says. I personally love the feeling of compression fabric, and I definitely notice a similar effect to that of my lymphatic drainage catsuit and leggings. The squeeze of material is somewhat energizing with every step I take. Of course, the best part is these look like jeans, so I'm able to construct a much more sophisticated, everyday look around them whether I'm dressing them up or down. They're just as cute styled with a going-out top as they are with a simple white T-shirt. What to Consider Before Buying the SpanxSculpt ReDefine Flare Jeans As mentioned in multiple places, these jeans do run small, so you should size up. I took one size larger than I usually do, but honestly could have sized up even further for comfort. However, it's important to note that the tighter they feel, the more they're doing their work to sculpt your curves. Because they only come in one standardized inseam, you may need to get them shortened if you're petite. (I'm 5'1\" and these were the perfect length with three-inch heeled boots, but they'd likely be dragging if I'd worn flats.) I should also mention that because of the numerous targeted sculpting zones, I did notice what I can only describe as extra lines or creases toward the top of my thighs at the back, which you can make out in the above photo. So while the sculpting technology is seamless, it doesn't exactly go unnoticed in certain lighting. Finally, there is a CA warning attached to this product, which means that the brand is advising customers of potential exposures to chemicals that may contribute to an individual's overall lifetime risk of cancer or risk of birth defects or other reproductive harm. You can review the Proposition 65 list of chemicals to better understand this warning. Where Are the SpanxSculpt ReDefine Flare Jeans Available? SpanxSculpt ReDefine denim is available exclusively on the brand's website. Rating: Sarah Wasilak (she/her) is the associate director of PS Shopping.

    "description": "Whether you’re a non-traditional bride searching for a unique wedding dress, optic-white separates, or luxe accessories for all your events (like a bachelorette, rehearsal dinner, and honeymoon), Ssense’s new bridal collection is the place for you. Following the success of its “anti-bridal” capsule in 2023 and Bridal 2.0 drop in 2024, the luxury retailer returns with its third iteration: Bridal 3.0, available to shop now.“For bridal 3.0, we again have well-established brands that are new to bridal like Issey Miyake, alongside some of our adored newcomers like Colleen Allen,” said vice president of Ssense womenswear buying and everything else, Brigitte Chartrand, in a press release. “A bride can have as many main character moments as she wants on her day.”This year’s lineup includes over 100 styles — from wedding dresses decked out in trending bows to sleek bridal separates, extravagant veils, and eye-catching floral- and pearl-accented jewelry. The capsule is rooted in an “individualistic approach to weddings,” according to the press release, encouraging brides to break the rules, make a statement, and feel fully themselves on their big day.Ahead, shop Ssense’s Bridal 3.0 collection for fashion-forward staples and re-wearable statement pieces for every part of the wedding journey. DashDividers_1_500x100 Ssense Wedding Dresses Bang Bipean Forget the ball gown. This edit is all about playful mini dresses, sheer showstoppers, and sculptural cocktail silhouettes in shades of white, ivory, and eggshell. While you can splurge on a Vivienne Westwood wedding dress for $9,550, most pieces range from $595 to $2,400. DashDividers_1_500x100 Ssense Bridal Separates Not into wedding dresses? Opt for a statement top (corsets! boleros!) paired with a mini skirt or tailored trousers. These, along with a lingerie set, work just as well for bridal showers and honeymoons. DashDividers_1_500x100 Ssense Bridal Headpieces The veil gets a reboot with both long and short styles — plus a lineup of unconventional headpieces like oversized bows, textured headbands, and sculptural caps. You’ll want to re-wear these well beyond the wedding day. DashDividers_1_500x100 Ssense Bridal Shoes \u0026 Accessories From chunky heels and garters to opera gloves and satin sandals, Ssense’s bridal accessories are not to miss. Try Shushu/Tong for your bachelorette, Simone Rocha down the aisle, and Issey Miyake for the honeymoon. Again, each piece is the type you can style again and again post-”I do’s,” especially for a summer party. DashDividers_1_500x100 Ssense Bridal Jewelry The jewelry edit may be small, but it’s full of impact — from “Just Married” heart-shaped earrings to bold floral hoops and chunky pearl chokers.
