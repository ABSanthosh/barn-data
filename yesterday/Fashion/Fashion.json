You’ve watched all the trailers, you’ve giggled at the charming cast interviews, you’ve practiced “Defying Gravity” in the mirror — you’re ready to hop on the train to Oz in November. There’s perhaps one more thing you can do to prep, though: Shop one of the many, many excellent Elphaba and Glinda-themed collaborations ahead of Wicked‘s November 22 release in theaters.Inspired by the leading witches played by Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, these fashion-forward Wicked collections are worth ogling over, whether you’re in the market for a classic logo T-shirt or are looking for dazzling shoes, bags, and jewelry to feel like you’re part of the ensemble. Whether you wear them around the house or to the theater, we promise that these limited-edition products from brands like H\u0026M and Béis are “gonna be popular.”We’ve rounded up the best Wicked collaborations on the market (as well as a special Wizard of Oz collection) and ones that are dropping soon, ahead of the film’s debut. DashDividers_1_500x100 Gap x Wicked Few do a collaboration as well as Gap, so we aren’t surprised that the retailer released a Wicked collection. It predominantly features childrenswear and accessories in the film’s signature pink, green, and black colorways. However, adults can shop Glinda and Elphaba hoodies. Shop full Gap x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Rebecca Minkoff x Wicked Before running to the theater, you’ll want to grab one of Rebecca Minkoff’s Wicked handbags. The designer released two special-edition styles, inspired by Elphaba and Glinda, each as enchanting as the other. Channel Elphaba with a gold-studded leather shoulder bag or Glinda with a crystal-adorned pink mini bag. “This collaboration allowed us to merge fashion with a narrative that celebrates individuality, friendship, and the strong female leads that are Elphaba and Glinda,” Minkoff said, in a press release.  Shop full Rebecca Minkoff x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Roots x Wicked Canadian brand Roots has released a luxe loungewear and accessory collection for adults and children. From unisex matching sweatsuit separates featuring the brand’s logo and slogan, “Equality \u0026 Integrity,” to an Emerald City graphic cardigan, this collection is totally Wicked-ified. It also includes extra-luxe styles, including a varsity jacket ($1,198) and duffle bag ($998). Shop full Roots x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Crocs x Wicked After last summer’s wildly popular Barbie x Crocs collaboration, the foam footwear brand is back with quirky Wicked styles. Channel Elphaba in the brand’s classic clogs with a metallic green upper, patterned sole, and textured heel strap. Alternatively, you can reinterpret Glinda’s style in pink platform clogs with a glimmering patterned upper and 3-D bubble sole. Each style comes with six themed Jibbitz charms. (You can also purchase a separate Wicked charm pack to clip onto the Crocs already in your closet, or add onto these new specialty shoes.) Shop full Crocs x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Forever 21 x Wicked Want to cop all your Wicked merch in one place? Then you may want to shop Forever 21’s new collection of 80+ styles across womenswear, menswear, childrenswear, accessories, and beauty products inspired by the film. Full of statement pleats, lace, organza, rosettes, and embellishments, the texture-forward pieces draw inspiration from Wicked’s costumes and aesthetic. And get excited because the brand’s previously sold-out Elphaba and Glinda jersey dresses have been restocked in standard and plus sizes. Shop full Wicked x Forever 21 collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Vera Bradley x Wicked Enchanting and opulent, Vera Bradley’s Wicked collaboration is split up into the rosy Glinda Collection and hypnotic Elphaba Collection. The 35-piece assortment includes travel bags and accessories, handbags, apparel, and home décor in whimsical patterns inspired by the Emerald City and its characters. Shop for a weekender, jewelry pouch, silk scarf, and matching umbrella for your travels, or slip into a robe and slippers with a throw blanket and printed tumbler for cozy days in. Shop full Vera Bradley x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Target x Wicked What happens when you put Wicked costume designer Paul Tazewell and beloved retailer Target together? Well, you get magic (at an affordable price point). In a video, Tazewell said he wanted to create contrasting pieces that could complement each other, incorporating “grounded” textured knits to represent Elphaba and “airborne” sheer fabrics for Glinda. The adult and kids collection includes cozy season staples like sweatsuits, slippers, and blankets. Shop full Target x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Bombas x Wicked Keep your toes warm (and stylish) this fall with Bombas socks in Wicked-ified designs. Get yourself individual pairs of striped and sparkling ankle, crew, or calf socks, or consider gifting four-style packs to your besties for the holidays. The brand’s do-good mission also extends to this collection: Just as Wicked is “a story that shows us the power of inclusion, and what’s possible when people connect and stick together,” the brand vows to donate a pair of socks to organizations like Miracle Messages, Neighborhood Coalition for Shelter, and River Fund for every pair purchased, per a press release. Shop full Wicked x Bombas collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Marc Jacobs x Wizard of Oz While this isn’t a Wicked fashion collection, we couldn’t help but shine a light on the new Wizard of Oz collaboration from Marc Jacobs, inspired by the 1939 film. It features twists on the brand’s signature styles, like The Tote Bag with several movie-scene prints and Kiki boots in ruby red slipper iteration. The nostalgic collection also includes limited-edition apparel and jewelry. Shop full Marc Jacobs x Wizard of Oz collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Marks \u0026 Spencer x Wicked This British retailer recently debuted a Wicked collaboration, which is available to ship to the US. The limited-edition collection includes printed womens’ sleepwear sets and girls’ ready-to-wear styles inspired by the film’s leading ladies, as well as popular settings like the Emerald City and Shiz University. Shop full Marks \u0026 Spencer x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Aldo x Wicked Step into the Land of Oz… in spellbinding heels! Aldo’s Wicked collaboration is full of bewitching shoes, handbags, jewelry, and more accessories, like hair bows and sunglasses. Choose whether you want to channel Elphaba or Glinda in emerald green and black or head-to-toe bubblegum pink and white. (Don’t worry: Both are dripping in crystals, pearls, and gold charms.) There are even men’s shoes and a unique advent calendar. The collection is also Ariana Grande-approved — she wore custom Aldo pumps inspired by the collaboration on Saturday Night Live. Shop full Aldo x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Cambridge Satchel x Wicked If you’re looking to sport a style from the actual film, you’ll be delighted to know that British heritage brand Cambridge Satchel has a bag and accessory collection that includes the pink Binocular Bag that Grande as Glinda is seen wearing in the trailer. There are several leather, velvet, and glitter-finish handbags, pouches, and charms that take inspiration from Glinda, Elphaba, Shiz University, and the Grimmerie spell book. Whether you reach for a jet black messenger or a green-and-pink colorblocked crossbody, any of these styles will transport you into the world of Wicked.  Shop full Cambridge Satchel x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 H\u0026M x Wicked Another brand that knows a thing or two about creating lust-worthy collaborations is H\u0026M. The R29 reader-favorite retailer recently dropped a whimsical Wicked capsule that includes pieces you can wear to the theater, as well as styles that Glinda or Elphaba may don themselves. While many of the accessories and beauty products have sold out, you can still wave your wand (read: credit card) to graphic T-shirts and an edgy asymmetrical dress. Shop full H\u0026M x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Lele Sadoughi x Wicked While most brands have collaborated with Wicked the movie, accessory brand Lele Sadoughi worked with the Broadway musical in honor of its 21st anniversary. The 12-piece collection is inspired by Glinda and Elphaba’s iconic styles, featuring statement headbands, bedazzled hair bows, and wand-inspired earrings. The pink-striped organza headband is even crafted from the same fabric used in Glinda’s on-stage dress, which any theater kid could cry over. Shop full Lele Sadoughi x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Béis x Wicked Although Elphaba and Glinda take to the skies in brooms and bubbles, you can still fly in style… with stunning luggage. Béis has a (nearly sold out) Wicked luggage collab that sees the brand’s best-selling hard suitcases, weekender bags, totes, and toiletry bags rendered in limited-edition pinks, sold-out greens, plus magical ombré. You can also look forward to the new small carry-on rollers releasing on December 4, just in time for holiday travel. Shop full Béis x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Sydney Evan x Wicked Perhaps the most extravagant collaboration on this list, this elegant and enchanting 100-piece  jewelry collection is for real Wicked fanatics. Sydney Evans’ new fine jewelry capsule collection includes styles with price points as high as $31k, but you can also find majestical 14k gold-and-gemstone charms starting at $265. Shop full Wicked x Sydney Evans collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Eugenia Kim x Wicked You may not want to walk around in a witch hat like Elphaba, but you can still sport Wicked-inspired headwear this fall and winter. Eugenia Kim released elevated hats, headpieces, and cool-weather accessories like scarves and fingerless gloves inspired by the film. To channel either Elphaba or Glinda, pick between sultry dark green or sweet light pink beanies, berets, wide-brim hats, and headbands. Many styles even include gold and silver Oz logo plates. Shop full Eugenia Kim x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Foster Grant x Wicked Seeing through rose-colored glasses never looked so good. Throw on a pair of spellbinding sunnies from Foster Grant’s eight-piece Wicked collection. The playful frames feature whimsical details (i.e. green lenses and butterfly motifs) and quirky names (i.e. Not Your Basic Witch and Ozmopolitan). Whether you desire a chunky green-and-black Elphaba-inspired style or a dainty pink Glinda-inspired design, it’ll be hard to pass up on these $40 frames.  Shop full Wicked x Foster Grant collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Aerie x Wicked Aerie’s Wicked capsule was one of the first collaborations to drop, which means many styles have been selling out. But you can still feel cute and cozy in several of the collection’s logo sweatshirts, sweatpants, T-shirts, and crew socks. Lounge around your home in style bubble-printed boxer shorts and oversized tees. Shop full Aerie x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Claire’s x Wicked Get into the spirit of the much-anticipated film with cutesy costume jewelry and accessories from Claire’s. The brand’s new Wicked merchandise includes necklaces, earrings, scrunchies, and pin packs that you can wear together or split with your bestie. There are also several bow clips, a charm keychain, and on-theme stationery. The full collection launches on November 7, so keep an eye on this space to shop. Shop full Claire’s x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Camilla x Wicked If you want to embrace the fantastical imagery of the Land of Oz, you’ll want to keep a lookout for Australian brand Camilla’s upcoming Wicked collaboration, which launches on November 13. The luxurious 85-piece collection across womenswear, menswear, childrenswear, and accessories comes in three new prints: Defy Gravity (inspired by Elphaba and Emerald City), Totally OZmopolitan (inspired by Glinda), and Munchkinland. “Our journey to the vibrant world of Oz is a visual feast,” said designer Camilla Franks, in a press release.  Shop the Wicked x Camilla collaboration on November 13 Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/vera-bradley-women-cotton-hathaway-tote-review-49406550",
    "description": "Out of pure curiosity (and with a little fear of the cringe), I recently scrolled way too far back in my old photos to pinpoint the last time I proudly toted a Vera Bradley bag. After wading through a parade of painfully awkward concert pics, I finally spotted it: my beloved hot-pink wristlet, in a photo timestamped 2010 on Facebook. That fabric wristlet went everywhere with me until one fateful day when I tucked it away in my closet next to its matching tote and, honestly, forgot it even existed - that is, until 2024. Lately, I've been getting the sense that Vera Bradley is on the brink of a comeback. The brand has stepped beyond its iconic floral prints, embracing more modern styles like understated colors, trendy bows, bag charms, and youthful silhouettes like crescent shapes (kind of similar to my favorite Staud bag, but in a signature Vera pattern and unstructured shape). Naturally, I had to scope out their updated lineup (specifically on Amazon because I'm an impatient Prime shopper), and before I knew it, the Cotton Hathaway Tote ($70, originally $100) was in my cart. So, did this order spark the official rekindling of my Vera Bradley love affair? The verdict, ahead. About the Vera Bradley Cotton Hathaway Tote The Vera Bradley Women's Cotton Hathaway Tote is available in seven designs on Amazon, or nine if you shop directly from Vera Bradley's site. It comes in four fabric options: cotton, nylon, leather, and canvas. Choose from three sizes: mini, small, and regular. The regular size measures 13.25\"W x 13.0\"H x 5.25\"D with a 10.25-inch handle drop. It's machine-washable on a cold, gentle cycle with like colors. What I Like About the Vera Bradley Cotton Hathaway Tote What I love about the Vera Bradley Women's Cotton Hathaway Tote is, first and foremost, its understated autumnal hues. I chose the Marrakesh Cinnamon design, which features a warm brown base topped with a rich floral pattern. It has a subtly bohemian vibe and feels quintessentially autumn. Unlike the bold pink bags I used to carry back in 2010, this one's easy to style with my everyday wardrobe. I honestly can't remember if Vera Bradley offered anything this toned down back then, but back in the day, it felt like their unofficial motto was \"the brighter, the better.\" Another thing I love about this tote is the size. I used to own what's now called the Original Tote Bag, and let's just say, I had no business using it as a bookbag in high school. I'd stuff it with textbooks, workout clothes for gym class, and anything else that could fit until it was so overloaded I had to grab a second bag. Now, as an adult, it's such a relief to have a bag that's spacious (but not too spacious) and perfect for stashing my essentials - like a lightweight jacket, book, water bottle, wallet, makeup bag, you name it - without feeling overstuffed. Maybe it's the nostalgia or simply how much I love my new purchase, but carrying this handbag just puts me in a good mood. I'm a texture person, so the soft cotton reminds me of all things warm and cozy. It feels easy, familiar, and effortlessly stylish, like it's always been a part of my wardrobe. What to Consider Before Buying the Vera Bradley Cotton Hathaway Tote One concern that popped up a few times in the reviews was that some shoppers weren't sure how to tie the bag to achieve the folded-in sides shown in one of the product photos. \"I can't for the life of me get the sides to fold in like it shows in the description picture,\" one reviewer shared, giving it three stars. \"That was the only reason I got this because I wanted to have the ends fold in so it's not a huge, bulky, wide bag.\" While I hadn't initially thought about compressing the tote, once I figured it out, I couldn't wait to wear it that way. Inside, there are two strings you simply tie together in a bow, and the sides naturally fold in. Just secure the tie closure, and voilà - you've got a more compact, less bulky bag that looks extra chic. I'm excited to wear it this way on days when I only need a few essentials and can forgo the full-size tote. Where Is the Vera Bradley Cotton Hathaway Tote Available? The Vera Bradley Women's Cotton Hathaway Tote is available on Amazon as well as direct-to-consumer from the brand's website.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/good-american-soft-tech-denim-review-49406797",
    "description": "Good American is known for its innovative material, B-corp certified production, and inclusivity when it comes to sizing. To be frank, I wish every denim brand looked a lot more like this one. And when I heard the label was re-launching its bestselling Soft-Tech jeans for fall, I knew PS editors had to be among the first to test out the new selection. GA introduced some of its signature silhouettes, like the Good Waist Palazzo Jeans, Good Curve Bootcut, and Good Petite, in this curve-hugging fabric that's honestly pretty game-changing (not to give everything away right here on the spot). What's so great about the Soft-Tech denim? It's one of the most sustainable fibers on the market, according to the brand, blending a lightweight, silk feel and TENCEL™ to create a flexible and soft jean that magically lifts and flatters in all the right places. In other words, it provides a surprising amount of structure for feeling like a pair of leggings when you pull them on. PS editors are well-versed in product testing, and we've tried some of the most renowned denim brands on the market - from Madewell to Levi's to Gap - so we took a very meticulous approach to delivering our reviews. Ahead, you can see photos of us modeling four different styles; read about our experiences not just wearing, but washing these jeans; and choose the pair that's right for you if you're down to invest. Sorry for yet another spoiler, but I highly doubt you'll regret it.",
