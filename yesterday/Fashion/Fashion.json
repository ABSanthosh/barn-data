    "description": "If you were already toying with the idea of braving the naked dress trend, catching a glimpse of Doechii at the 2025 Billboard Women in Music Awards may just seal the deal for you. As someone who has thrown a birthday party for myself solely so that I could have a reason to wear a naked dress, I get it. When I scrolled past a reel of model Chloe Lecareux wearing Onarin's Ms. Hearts bustier and fishtail skirt a few months ahead of my birthday month, the wheels started spinning. By the end of the week, I had at least five different restaurants in mind and a guest list of my closest friends at the ready. Maybe it was the Taurus in me, but I was hell-bent on pulling off this set - and it was only after I ordered the look that I really began to process just how sheer the silk-chiffon fabric actually was. I was excited to deliver the shock factor; to bravely show off my curves when I hit the street the way celebrities do on the red carpet. \"Welp, I guess I'm trying this whole naked dress thing,\" I thought to myself as I pulled up Commando's site to track down the right underwear. In preparation, I placed an order for the classic control thong and shaping brief, unsure just how cheeky I might go in this decidedly revealing, ultrafitted ensemble. The Stolen Stores team assured me that the retail site's in-house made-to-measure team would develop a personalized size for me, so the co-ords would fit me just right. But at the end of the day, they were still see-through. People were going to see my underwear, and I was probably going to feel pretty naked. Truthfully, I thought this all to be a fun, timely experiment, especially since the naked dress trend has become standard among celebrities and mere mortals alike. Sheer fabrics are a common detail, and I think there's something to be said for having the confidence to show off your body - however much or little you like. When the Onarin pieces finally arrived, I abandoned my doubt and slipped into the outfit, only to find that both separates were a little snug. (Quick tip: if you're already thinking about ordering the set, add an inch to your usual measurements upon placing your order.) Luckily, the exchange for a new, customized size was coordinated in more than enough time for my birthday dinner. I was excited to deliver the shock factor; to bravely show off my curves when I hit the street the way celebrities do on the red carpet. Ahead, see how I ended up accessorizing my look and read my final review of the Onarin naked dress.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/levis-501-original-cropped-jeans-review-49435747",
    "description": "Roomier denim styles have helped coax me out of my winter sweatsuit addiction, but I realized that living in barrel jeans also has its limitations. While oversize pants are a vibe, it turns out that teaming them with my other oversize closet favorites wasn't particularly flattering. I needed a pair of jeans that would look great with anything, whether it was just sneakers and a T-shirt for school pick-up or heels and a bodysuit for date night. They needed to be comfortable - obviously - and timeless enough to transcend seasonal trends. I decided to finally try an iconic denim brand and style I had somehow overlooked all of my life, the Levi's 501 Original Cropped Jeans ($98). What I Like About the Levi's 501 Original Cropped Jeans This pair of Levi's jeans nails the popular mom-jean aesthetic: high-rise for tummy support and absolutely no crack-baring potential; fitted in the waist and hips but loose and straight throughout the legs. They are slightly cropped (I'm 5'6\" and chose the 28 inseam length), which gives them a modern feel and shows off cute shoe details. I chose the no-stretch option in the Worn In Medium Indigo for a truly classic look. The no-stretch material helps them to keep their shape, even when I'm kneeling and running around with my kids and dog throughout the day. The color is that perfect medium wash - the kind you instantly envision when you think of a classic pair of jeans. They're dark enough that they can be dressed up easily but also look right at home with warm-weather blouses and casual T-shirts. Did I mention that they also make your butt look good? Well, they do. What's Worth Noting About the Levi's 501 Original Cropped Jeans If you're used to stretchy jeans, the no-stretch transition might take a beat to get used to. After being a stretchy-jean person for years, I've recently converted to team no-stretch and am loving the change. The material gets softer the more you wear them and unlike stretchy jeans, they don't cling to you. It's also worth noting that these have a button fly, which is another lifestyle jump from a zipper. Initially, un-buttoning and buttoning each time you use the bathroom can feel like a pain, but I got used to it and came to appreciate the security I feel with all of the buttons. Who Are the Levi's 501 Original Cropped Jeans Best For? If you're looking for jeans that you'll reach for year after year, these are a fantastic pick. They're perfect for anyone craving a truly classic pair of denim that is versatile, flattering, and comfortable. Where Are the Levi's 501 Original Cropped Jeans Available? You can pick these jeans up at Levi's.

    "description": "With April showers approaching, it’s time for the return of the trench coat, the quintessential spring must-have. Not too heavy, not too light (dare we say, just right?), and typically made from water-repellant and wind-resistant fabrics, trenches are the outerwear of choice for transitional weather. While knee- and calf-length jackets are always a wise wardrobe investment, this season, a new crop of, well, cropped styles are trending.  Rather than a traditional, longline trench coat, cropped styles are a bit boxier and often more casual, offering a modern twist on a classic staple. From chic khaki and green options to unique silhouettes and fabrics, like cape jackets and denim iterations, there are plenty of styles to peruse.Read on to pluck out a sporty design for long walks, a lady-like style for work and al fresco dinners, or a versatile jacket that can do it all.All linked products are independently selected by our editors.
