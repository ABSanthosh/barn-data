    "description": "The challenging 870-mile trail cuts diagonally across Romania and takes in mountain meadows, fairytale forests and medieval monasteriesIt was about seven minutes into my cycle ride that the first signs of addiction became apparent. My ebike’s “power assist” button felt more like a morphine clicker as we climbed the misty hills of Bucovina in northern Romania. Sergiu, my group’s guide, knew what I was up to. “Be honest with yourself – only use ‘turbo’ if you have to!” he shouted. My thumb cowered under the handlebar.On previous adventures I’ve resisted assistance, maintaining that battery power is the preserve of the unserious. Nowadays, though, my pins aren’t as powerful, and on these vertiginous hills the extra oomph was near essential. But as with all drugs, moderation is key. After all, one wouldn’t want to run out of juice on hills that are home to wolves, bears and lynx. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-spirit-of-jarrow",
    "description": "On October 5, 1936, 200 men from Jarrow in Northumberland, England, began a protest march to Parliament to call for economic assistance in northeast England. Taking place during an economic depression, the march took 26 days and covered 282 miles. Today, the historic protest is known as the Jarrow March. Northumberland and northeast England had long been a center of shipbuilding and steel manufacturing, but in 1936 thousands were unemployed, nearly 80% of all workers at its peak. David Riley, who was head of the Jarrow council, and Ellen Wilkinson, a local member of Parliament, led the crusade. The demonstration is often described as a \"Hunger March\" and has become a landmark event in British organized labor and radical politics. The marchers arrived in Westminster close to the opening of Parliament, where they presented a petition signed by 12,000 residents of the town of Jarrow. Supporters in towns and villages hosted the crusaders. And at the end of each day's march, Ellen Wilkinson made a speech at a public meeting. Instead of listening to Riley and Wilkinson's demands, the government cut off the marcher's unemployment benefits, claiming the crusaders had been unavailable for work during their 26-day protest. The Jarrow March has gone on to inspire numerous artists, and an opera, two musicals, three pop songs, five plays, and several works of art have been created about the event. Although the Jarrow  Crusade is a widely remembered and oft-celebrated celebrated event, it had little effect on the government in the short term. Despite a temporary boost from World War II, shipbuilding and steel manufacturing slowly disappeared from Jarrow and nearby South Shields and is nearly nonexistent today.  In honor of the 65th anniversary of the Jarrow Crusade, sculptor Graham Ibbotson created a commemorative bronze in 2001. The sculpture was installed in the parking lot of the Viking Shopping Center, near Jarrow town center. Ibbotson entitled the piece The Spirit of Jarrow. Situated on a brick plinth, the bronze depicts two marchers carrying a banner proceeded by a woman, two children, and a mongrel dog which became a mascot of the march. In reality, the Jarrow marchers were selected from the \"fit-men\" of the town and no children took part. Apart from Ellen Wilkinson, women did not take part directly in the march, but played a crucial supporting role.  These edits were intentional: Ibbotson strove to represent the wider political  \"crusade\" rather than just the march itself. In The Spirit of Jarrow, bronze figures are depicted walking through the ribs of a steel vessel as if it were under construction. There are also various depictions of the tools used by local skilled workers.",

    "title": "Pont de Montiberri in Lleida, Spain",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pont-de-montiberri",
    "description": "Pont de Montiberri is a submerged historical bridge in the Alta Ribagorça region, near Pont de Suert in Catalonia, Spain. It is an excellent example of medieval architecture, with a single semicircular arch that used to span a narrow section of the river.  Built using local stone, the bridge blends seamlessly with the surrounding natural landscape. Pont de Montiberri is located between Riuet del Convent and the Pantà d'Escales reservoir. A small brook, Riuet del Convent takes its name from the convent whose ruins are still visible near Pont de Montiberri. A dam on the imposing Noguera Ribagorçana River created the Pantà d'Escales.  In addition to producing hydroelectricity, the dam also regulates the amount of water flowing in the Noguera Ribagorçana River, which means that the water level of Pantà d'Escales varies considerably.  When the water level is high, the bridge is almost completely submerged, and its semicircular arch can only be seen below the waterline. The exact date of Pont de Montiberri's construction is unknown, but it was probably built before or during the construction of the adjacent convent, the Abadia de Santa Maria de Lavaix, which was founded in the 9th century.  The technique, materials, and architecture of the bridge are also consistent with medieval Spanish architecture during the 9th century.  Today, only a few ruins remain of the Abadia de Santa Maria de Lavaix. The ruins are located on higher ground along the shores of Pantà d'Escales.",
