    "description": "Dog lovers share their tips on the best accommodation and beaches to set tails wagging across the UK and Ireland• Tell us about a midsummer trip – the best tip wins a £200 holiday voucherRecently, Cornwall Council lifted the season-long dog ban on many of the county’s beaches, restricting it to just July and August rather than the six months or so it had been previously. The council publishes a list of beaches, with all restrictions listed, that it’s important to check before heading out (there are still 11 beaches where dogs are banned between 10am and 6pm, and there are three protected wildlife areas where they are banned at all times). One of the best beaches, we think, is at Gunwalloe where visitors can stay at the National Trust holiday cottage right by the beach and the cafe has water bowls for dogs. Church Cove is restricted for dog owners in July and August but Dollar Cove next door is dog-friendly at all times. The coast path runs right along the beaches and takes you over to Poldhu or Porthleven, so there are plenty of options for walkies.Layla Astley Continue reading...",

    "description": "The city once neglected its most famous son. But this summer visitors can immerse themselves in a major new exhibition and see the artist’s restored studio, home and the landscapes that inspired himPaul Cezanne is everywhere in Aix-en-Provence: there are streets named after him as well as a school, a cinema and even a sandwich (a version of traditional pan bagnat but with goat’s cheese instead of tuna). And from late June, the whole city will go Cezanne mad, as the painter’s atelier, north of the centre, and the family home to the west reopen after an eight-year restoration.But during Cezanne’s lifetime, and for years after his death in 1906, Aix seemed at pains to ignore the artist later called the “father of modern art”. When his widow, Hortense, offered several paintings to the city’s main Musée Granet, director Henri Pontier declared that Cezanne paintings would enter the gallery only over his dead body.

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/petwood-hotel-bouncing-bomb",
    "description": "The now privately owned Petwood Hotel served as the base for the Dambusters, who developed the Bouncing Bomb during World War II. The bomb was unleashed on three German dams, destroying factories, power plants, railways, roads, and mines, and killing more than 1,500 people.  During the historic Dambusters Raid, the Bouncing Bomb skimmed across water before sinking to destroying two German dams in two attacks. This attack helped the Allies turn the war against the Germans. The quiet town of Woodhall Spa still honors the Dambusters legacy. The Petwood Hotel and The Golf Hotel were requisitioned by the RAF and the wooded area around the village was used to hide secretive military equipment. Although the Dambusters would take off from the nearby RAF Scampton, Woodhall Spa and its own nearby RAF base were used to accommodate support teams for the Dambusters, with Petwood Hotel itself accommodating the officers of the Dambusters squadron. Visitors to the Petwood Hotel will find a memorial garden which honors the Dambusters where memorial fountains flow with water and plaques display names of those who gave their lives for their country. Within the garden sit the remains of one of the Bouncing Bombs prototypes.  During the Bouncing Bombs tests, most protypes were left at the bottom of deep water after they had finished bouncing over the surface. Others disintegrated during the tests, so surviving examples of the bouncing bomb from WWII are very rare. The genuine prototype that sits in the memorial garden for the Dambusters is a beautiful and poignant link between the past and present, allowing people of today to see the bomb with their own eyes and feel that little bit closer to what has become one of the most historic British raids in WWII.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/raf-harrington-england",
    "description": "RAF Harrington, the remains of which still stand on a piece of farm land, first opened in September 1943 and was originally intended for the No. 84 Operational Training Unit. RAF Harrington is considered to be the most intact of the 20 former Thor missile sites and is therefore an important piece of Cold War architecture.United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Eighth Air Force and engineer battalions from the US Army converted the area for heavy bomber use in spring 1944. The airbase became USAAF Station 179. A number of USAAF units were stationed there throughout World War II, the first unit being the 801st Bombardment Group in March 1944. The 801st Bombardment Group became well known for their role in Operation Carpetbagger. The Carpetbaggers would fly Special Operations missions, delivering supplies to resistance groups in enemy occupied territories. Following the Second World War, RAF Harrington gradually fell into disuse and began to return to farmland. In the aftermath of the war, tensions were high between the US and Soviet Union and thus began a terrifying arms race. Fearful that the Soviets would deploy a long-range ballistic missile before the US, the United States Air Force (USAF) and the Douglas Aircraft Corporation began developing the Thor intermediate-range ballistic missile, with thermonuclear warheads, between 1955 and 1956. This program progressed quickly as a stop-gap measure and within three years of its inception, twenty RAF Thor squadrons (Project Emily) became operational in the UK. In 1958, the former airbase at Harrington was repurposed as one of these Thor missile sites, as part of the British nuclear deterrent. Three concrete, rocket launch pads were constructed, as well as a number of ancillary buildings; the perimeter was once again fenced off and the site declared top secret. The Intercontinental ballistic missile was soon developed and as soon as this became operational in the US, the Thor missiles were quickly retired in the UK. The last of these missiles were withdrawn from operational alert in 1963. With the end of Project Emily, RAF Harrington was once again returned to agricultural use and many of the concreted areas were removed. Today, all that remains are the ruins of the three Thor Missile launch pads, the pyrotechnic store and the classified storage building. In 2011, following the 50th anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Thor missile site at Harrington was awarded Grade II listed status.",
