    "description": "You won’t see legions of tourists on this trail in Peneda-Gerês, first blazed by ancient imperial invaders – but it’s just possible you’ll see a lone wolf‘Fabulous views in wonderful scenery,” say today’s walking notes. I don’t doubt it. But now, with the wind getting up and a mist creeping over the ridge, there’s little to see other than the ground at our feet. Which is why my attention is drawn to, shall we say, a canine deposit.“But there are no dogs up here. It’s been two hours and just over four miles since that yappy little mongrel in the last village. And there are certainly no dog walkers; not one hint of another human in this wild terrain. No, the size, shape and furriness of this trailside offering reveal its author was the ancestor of all dogs: a wolf. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/twelve-mile-limit",
    "description": "Twelve Mile Limit, tucked away in an unassuming residential area off Tulane Ave in Mid-City, might be the best neighborhood bar in New Orleans. It’s got all the makings of a great dive—the room is dim and bedecked with old show posters and Christmas lights, the ceilings are low, the jukebox is good, and the pool table is often covered up for nightly events. There’s a friendly, communal vibe, with mostly locals and regulars holding up the bar. It doesn’t hurt that the drinks are world-class, thanks to owner T. Cole Newton’s pedigree in the New Orleans cocktail scene. On any given night of the week, you can find comedy open-mics, trivia nights, karaoke, and other events like Queer Craft Night, Sexy Bing-Oh, and more. Styled as a cocktail dive bar, Twelve Mile undersells and over-delivers. Over the years, it has invested back into its neighborhood, installing solar panels and a battery storage system that decreases their carbon footprint and allows them to serve as a local charging station during power outages. They also partner with local non-profits and hold events for like-minded organizations and campaigns, and a percentage of their monthly sales supports affordable housing in their community.  While Twelve Mile may be far off the well-worn tourist trail in the city, what it offers is far more in line with the ethos of New Orleans and what the city prides itself on—creativity, acceptance, and irreverence, and a desire to sit down with friends, throw back a few cocktails, and just have a grand old time.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kikori-river-basin-great-papuan-plateau",
    "description": "The Kikori River Basin (KRP) is a remote region of the Southern Province of Papua New Guinea. The KRP contains one of the largest expanses of pristine forest in the Southern Hemisphere with high levels of endemic flora and fauna species. Although not the most populous region of Papua New Guinea, over 16 different ethnic groups reside throughout the KRP. Due to its remoteness, the residents of the KRP still rely on nature for their livelihoods and continue their traditional ways of living.   Traveling to the Kikori River Basin requires love for remote exploration, adaptability, respect for diverse cultural systems, and openness to step way out of your comfort zone. Few roads exist in the KRP region, so the primary form of travel is by river in dugout canoes. Throughout your journey, you can revel in the grandeur of breathtaking Wasi Falls, serene Lake Kutubu, and giant limestone karsts. Each village interspersed throughout the region provides a unique experience, from the longhouse cultures of the highlands to those in the delta regions. Shop at the Mendi market for a bilum bag keepsake, the quintessential cultural and artistic craft of Papua New Guinean traditions; marvel at the anthropologic artifacts at burial caves and of cave paintings; and even share in a buai (betelnut) break with a local, at your own discretion (this customary practice of chewing and spitting out the nut while dipping a mustard stick in lime powder gives a person a sense of elation, but has severe long-term health impacts). Buai break or not, opportunities abound to connect with locals and learn about this culturally and ecologically diverse region.",
