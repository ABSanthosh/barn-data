    "description": "A six-day hike on Arran – a new Unesco Geopark – reveals tales of dinosaurs, tectonic plate collisions and lightning strikes from millions of years agoAround 240m years ago, a 12-foot-long reptile called a chirotherium walked along a beach in what was then part of the supercontinent of Pangaea, and what is now the shoreline of Kildonan village, on the rugged, southern coast of the Isle of Arran. Natural dykes of black igneous rock – cooled magma – jut out into the ocean here. The houses on shore are backdropped by grassy cliffs.We know that this giant proto-crocodile once roamed here because it left behind footprints – which can still be seen today. “This is older than the dinosaurs,” says Malcolm Wilkinson of Arran Geopark, as we crouch down next to the trace fossil. I place my hand in the massive print and attempt to imagine the world millions of years ago, when Scotland sat just north of the equator and the climate was tropical. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Still gliding above the town of Wuppertal on an overhead track 125 years after it was built, the charming Schwebebahn has lost none of its magicIt’s easy to be seduced by the romance of train travel. Think of sleeper trains, boat trains, vintage steam railways, elegant dining cars. But it’s rare that an urban transport system can capture the imagination quite as much as the Wuppertal Schwebebahn in Germany caught mine, and that of anyone else who’s clapped eyes on the world’s oldest suspended railway.In October it will be 125 years since Kaiser Wilhelm II took a test ride in the Schwebebahn, just a few months before the hanging railway officially opened for business in March 1901. It was an incredible feat of engineering then, and remains so today. Even with sleek modern carriages having long replaced the original ones, it looks like something imagined by Jules Verne, with carriages smoothly gliding under the overhead track. They have even preserved the first 1901 carriage, nicknamed Kaiserwagen, which can be hired for private occasions. Continue reading...",

    "description": "On an otherwise modern street, a building that appears to be plucked straight from the early 1900s stands tall on Fisher Avenue in Poolesville, Maryland. The Old Town Hall and former National Bank of Poolesville comprise the Historic Medley District along with John Poole House and Seneca Schoolhouse. The Old Town Hall Bank Museum and Exhibit Hall has a permanent Civil War exhibit that highlights Poolesville's role in the war, including local artifacts from that era found in the town, drawings and pictures of local conflicts, and exhibits on key individuals from Poolesville who were part of the war. The building dates to 1907 and has been restored to its original appearance. In addition to the permanent exhibit, the museum presents cultural and educational programs on subjects such as African-American heritage, military tributes, art shows, bridal shows, photography contests, and explorations of local history. This slice of living history exists thanks to Historic Medley District, Inc.—a preservation project started in 1974 by 27 residents of Montgomery County, Maryland who shared concerns about the neglect and disappearance of buildings and landmarks of historical significance. The members, which now number approximately 150, have taken collective action through a multi-pronged approach of hands-on restoration, testifying before government groups, and providing expertise and guidance to the owners of the properties.",

    "description": "Soviet mosaics are perhaps not what one would expect to see in the city of palaces, yet this is one of its most famed public art pieces. The Potsdam mosaic was created in 1972 after the design of Fritz Eisel, who used it to decorate three sides of an otherwise boring socialist building. The mosaics show different scientific achievements, such as the launch of Sputnik in 1957 and Aleksey Leonov’s spacewalk in 1965. It also pays tribute to the people who made it possible, showing several panels of scientists and workers in scientific settings. One panel in particular has been the source of much discussion, as it shows the Earth wrong (some people believe that this is due to a misunderstanding of Eisel, who wanted to show the planet from the perspective from the space ship, but others believe that it was done as a form of silent protest from the workers).",
