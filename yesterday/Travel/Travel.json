    "description": "After decades of nomadic existence, the Polish capital’s art temple is open for permanent business in an inspirational, light-filled new buildingWhen Poland joined the European Union 20 years ago, our world changed. I was a student in Warsaw, and spent my savings on a train ticket to Berlin – not for migrant work, but to see the 200 masterpieces at the Neue Nationalgalerie on loan from the New York Museum of Modern Art.In 2017, while in the US, I rushed to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The very first painting I saw was a personal delight because the artist was a woman, Paulina Ołowska, and Polish. Continue reading...",

    "description": "The city and its stunning setting on Scotland’s north-east coast are surprisingly easy to explore by rail, bus and on footSeabirds fly below the train as it crosses the Firth of Forth with late afternoon light sparking the water. A kestrel hovers over hay meadows near Kirkcaldy. The lumpy Lomond Hills are sun-misted and the woods are touched with autumn gold. The final stretch of the seven-hour train journey from London to Aberdeen runs along the rocky Scottish shore past forts and firths. (York-Aberdeen costs from £32.30 one way, London from £68.80, lner.co.uk).Looking back, near Stonehaven station, I can see Dunnottar Castle. The walk from Stonehaven along the cliffs to this castle on its promontory in the North Sea is one of many exceptional car-free days out from Aberdeen. It’s a city I keep coming back to. I first arrived expecting oil rigs, grey buildings, and bad weather – and I found art galleries, wooded lochs, 91 miles of coast, and surprisingly mild weather in one of the UK’s sunniest cities. Aberdeenshire also has good, reliable public transport. I’m spending a week exploring by bus, from the county’s south-west corner in the Cairngorms to Scotland’s first mainland lighthouse on Aberdeenshire’s north-easterly tip. The scenic journeys I take are cheaper with a countywide Bluebird Explorer 7-Day MegaRider (£51.20/£38.40 full price/student). Continue reading...",

    "description": "This monument in front of a public library in Ürgüp, Cappadocia, is dedicated to a librarian who used a donkey to deliver books. Mustafa Güzelgöz became the caretaker at the Tahsin Ağa Library in his hometown of Ürgüp in the 1940s, when he was just 23 years old. He was a successful in taking care of the library, but it wasn't attracting many visitors. Güzelgöz decided that if the people didn't come to the library, the library would have to come to them. He created a traveling library, loading books into wooden crates and carrying them on the back of his donkey. He could carry up to 200 books at a time, and brought them around the villages surrounding Ürgüp. Over time, he became known as\"the librarian with the donkey.\" Güzelgöz died in 2005. His former home has been turned into a museum, and this monument was erected in front of Ürgüp's public library building in his honor.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/much-marcle-ancient-yew",
    "description": "In the small village of Much Marcle, an ancient tree stands beside St. Bartholomew’s Church. Though the church dates back to the 13th century, the tree is even older—it has a few centuries on the building. The yew’s hollow trunk is vast enough to accommodate several people standing inside it. The yew’s longevity and grandeur have earned it recognition as one of Britain’s most important trees. Yews have long been associated with churchyards in Britain, particularly because of their symbolic links to eternity and immortality. In ancient times, they were considered sacred, with some yews believed to have been planted on the sites of pre-Christian pagan worship. In the case of the Much Marcle yew, it is thought that the tree could have been standing long before Christianity took root in England, and may have been a focal point for spiritual activities. The yew tree's extraordinary age means it has been a silent witness to much of Britain’s history. Its hollow trunk now forms an impressive natural chamber, likely developed after the central wood decayed over the centuries. Despite this decay, the tree continues to thrive and is considered a living monument. The hollow core has been carefully preserved, allowing visitors to step inside, where the tree’s age becomes even more palpable. Beyond its symbolic and historical significance, the Much Marcle Yew is also ecologically important. Yews are long-living trees, and their resilience makes them a key feature in Britain’s ancient landscapes. The tree supports a diverse ecosystem, providing habitat for various species of wildlife, and its hardy nature exemplifies the yew’s importance in both cultural and environmental heritage.",
