    "description": "Exploring the magical landscape that inspired Narnia and stars as a location in Game of Thrones – just an hour outside of BelfastWhere is the finest mountain panorama in the UK? As a nine-year-old I was taken up Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon) and told it was the best. Even in those days, it was a struggle to see much except the backs of other people. The following summer Scafell Pike got the same treatment and the next year we climbed Ben Nevis. I disagreed on all counts. For me, Thorpe Cloud in Dovedale was unbeatable, despite it being under a thousand feet tall. What convinced me was the diminutive Derbyshire peak’s shape: a proper pointy summit with clear space all around, plus grassy slopes that you could roll down. The champion trio could not compare.This panorama question is in my mind as I begin hiking up Slieve Donard, Northern Ireland’s highest peak (at 850 metres), but a mountain often forgotten by those listing their UK hiking achievements. And a proper peak it is too, with a great sweeping drop to the sea and loads of space all around, guaranteeing, I reckon, a view to beat its more famous rivals. Continue reading...",

    "description": "A short stretch of chalk cliffs on the island of Møn could soon become a world heritage site due to its unique ecology of wild orchids and geology of 30-million-year-old fossilsAs we sauntered along sun-splashed woodland paths, our knowledgable guide Michael started to explain the links between the local geology and flora. The unusually luminous light green leaves of the beech trees? “That’s due to the lack of magnesium in the chalky soil.” The 18 species of wild orchid that grow here? “That’s the high calcium content. You see? Everything is connected.”That’s a phrase my companion and I kept hearing at Møns Klint on the Danish island of Møn. This four-mile (6km) stretch of chalk cliffs and hills topped by a 700-hectare (1,730-acre) forest was fashioned by huge glaciers during the last ice age, creating a unique landscape. In 2026, a Unesco committee will decide whether Møns Klint (“the cliffs of Møn”) should be awarded world heritage site status, safeguarding it for future generations. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Once part of a larger medieval fortification, the Torreón de Pinto is a 14th-century tower with a dark past. Far from being a mere fortification, it served as a prison for members of the Spanish nobility — most notably the enigmatic Princess of Éboli and the royal secretary Antonio Pérez, both entangled in the deadly intrigues of Philip II’s court. Beneath the tower, a gloomy cellar reportedly doubled as a torture chamber. Today, the tower stands in the heart of Pinto, Madrid, and each spring it becomes the centerpiece of the town’s Renaissance Festival, where a lively parade reenacts the princess’s dramatic imprisonment.",

The Palazzo was built after the devastation of the 1693 earthquake, extended and added to by subsequent generations, and completed in 1763. Visitors can see a range of rooms, including the large and exquisitely decorated Rococo ballroom, and the equally beautiful private quarters, including a Roman marble floor, to the side of the public rooms.",
