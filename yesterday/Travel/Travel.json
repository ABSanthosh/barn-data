    "description": "Overshadowed by St Davids and Tenby, the Welsh seaside town of Fishguard makes a great off-season base for coastal and country explorationIn Welsh mythology, Llŷr is the god of the sea. In his latest incarnation – a shimmering five-metre seahorse, keeping watch from Fishguard’s Marine Walk – he’s king of the Pembrokeshire coast.“I’m calling him Llŷr before anyone else names him,” local artist Gideon Petersen said as we gazed at his magnificent stainless steel creation, perhaps fearing a Seahorsey McSeahorseface situation. “I see him as a water dragon, protecting seafarers. He’ll be visible from the ferry, and will reflect whatever the sky is doing – he’ll catch all kinds of light.” Continue reading...",

    "description": "At a centre in the Wye Valley our writer puts aside her initial doubts and learns how silence and focusing on the breath can quieten the mind and boost wellbeingThere’s an itch on the end of my nose and I want to scratch it. Instead, I focus on slowly breathing in and out, noticing the sensation, but trying not to react. My feet feel numb and my hip is niggling from sitting still. I shift slightly on my cushion and try to concentrate on the air as it enters and leaves my nostrils.It’s day two of a 10-day silent Vipassana meditation course at Dhamma Dipa, a centre in Herefordshire’s Wye Valley. I’ve dabbled in various forms of meditation before, but this course – a real deep dive with 10 hours of meditation each day – is on a different level. According to the website, this is the minimum length of time needed to master the technique, so I’ve signed up in the hope it will kickstart a long-lasting practice. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Some 30 miles south of the Tayma oasis in Saudi Arabia stands a strange rock formation called Al Naslaa. Each balanced on a natural pedestal of sand, two large rocks rise above the desert—or what used to be a single, massive block of sandstone, split down the middle. The split is a narrow, clean slit, known as a “joint” in geology. Due to its laser precision, some conspiracy theorists have suspected advanced ancient technology, or even extraterrestrial involvement. But it’s a perfectly natural occurrence, even if it’s not common. The photogenic rock is not only of geological interest, but also archaeological. Adorning its south-west face, among more modern residues of vandalism, are petroglyphs dating back millennia, preserving ancient art and culture in an unexpected way.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/steinwache",
    "description": "The plain building right behind Dortmund’s central train station hides many secrets. Established as a police station, it was turned into a Gestapo prison during the Nazi rule. Now the building is a memorial museum on resistance and persecution. The police headquarters opened in 1906, and since it was located on Steinstraße, the locals soon started calling the building Steinwache (stone guard). In the 1920s, the police added a five-story prison building next to the initial headquarters. After the Nazis came to power in the 1930s, the Gestapo (the Nazi regime’s secret police) took over the premises, using the cells mainly for political prisoners and adding several rooms for interrogation and torture. Nicknamed Die Hölle von Westdeutschland (“the hell of Western Germany”), more than 66,000 people in total were imprisoned in Steinwache from 1933 to 1945. In the mid-to-late 1930s, the inmates were mostly social democratic and communist opposition members, but during the war years, the majority of prisoners were forced laborers, especially from Eastern Europe. During the notorious Kristallnacht in November 1938, the Gestapo arrested most of the working-age Jewish males living in Dortmund and imprisoned them in Steinwache. From there, most of them were sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Although most of Dortmund’s city center was destroyed during the Allied bombings, Steinwache was relatively unscathed. In the 1980s, work was initiated to transform the prison into a memorial site. Since 1992, it has hosted a permanent exhibition called “Widerstand und Verfolgung in Dortmund 1933-1945” (“Resistance and Persecution in Dortmund 1933-1945”). Former cells were turned into exhibition halls exhibiting photographs and texts about the regime’s persecution and numerous attempts to oppose it.",
