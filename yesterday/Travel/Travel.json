    "description": "Tackling a long-distance walk like the Thames Path or South Downs Way in short sections makes it manageable – and more spontaneous, tooIt is 7.30am. The sky is a pink-and-gold blur, and the breeze is invigorating. It’s a perfect day to walk from my London home to the source of the River Thames. I’m travelling light – phone, sandwich, water bottle – so I need nothing but a pair of capacious pockets. I have been walking the 185-mile Thames Path National Trail, with my friend Rhiannon, for more than four years. We do it bit by bit, a section at a time. No need to carry a heavy backpack. No need to book a hotel or pitch a tent. No need to use up weeks of precious holiday. No need to fret about whether we may fall out, or whether one of us will prove more ruggedly resilient than the other; nor any of the myriad factors that must be considered when planning a long-distance hike with a companion. And yes, we’re always back in time for a night in our own beds.These are just some of the practical benefits of hiking a long-distance trail in bite-size chunks, which compensate for the extra time we spend on travelling and logistics. This morning, for example, I must catch a bus, a tube and then a train to get to the point where we finished six months previously. But by 9am I’m at Henley on-Thames, almost exactly as Rhiannon arrives from her Surrey home. We will walk for just over 12 miles, stopping anywhere we fancy – the Stanley Spencer Gallery in Cookham and a Marlow church distracted us on the last stretch – eventually reaching Tilehurst, where we’ll catch different trains home.

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/agios-nikolaos-church-maza",
    "description": "Built in 1324, Agios Nikolaos Church is located in the quiet village of Maza Apokoronas, a 40-minute car ride from Chania in Crete. It is said to be one of the most important Byzantine monuments on the western side of the island. The church is a single-aisle, barrel-vaulted structure, with many frescoes decorating its walls. Ioannis Pagomenos, the painter of the frescoes, transformed the walls of the church into a beautiful tapestry of saints and biblical scenes. At the center there is Christ the \"Light-Giver\" found between the Virgin Mary and Saint Nicholas. Legend has it that Pagomenos was buried underneath the church. Archeologists from Greece occasionally visit the church to work on preserving the frescoes. Despite numerous initiatives to help with their preservation, the lack of frequent visitors and the church's age makes it challenging to maintain them in good condition. As a result, many of the frescoes appear faded, and due to the candles that the visitors have been lighting, some of them appear black from the smoke. For anyone in Crete seeking a blend of history, art, and a touch of mystery, Agios Nikolaos is the place to visit.",

    "description": "Northern Taiwan once had a thriving coal industry, but it declined due to low-quality deposits, mine collapses, and international competition. By 2000, the last mine closed. Today, much of this history has faded from public memory, though traces remain across the landscape. Just two kilometers from Taipei 101, once the tallest building in the world, lies Hexing Coal Mine, one of many abandoned mines in the region. The Taipei City government has turned this site into a small historical park to preserve its legacy.  The site, more of a mini-museum, takes about 5 to 10 minutes to explore. It includes two main areas: the track section and the mine entrance. The track section contain a status of a miner pushing a cart and a mural depicting the coal production process. By the entrance, a charming statue of a pangolin holding mining tools offers a whimsical nod to the mine’s history. A short path leading into the mine houses simple exhibits on coal mining culture and history.",
