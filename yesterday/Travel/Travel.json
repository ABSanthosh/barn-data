    "description": "As a new exhibition celebrating the portraits of Edvard Munch opens at London’s National Portrait Gallery, we take a trip to the artist’s home city in NorwayI reach Ekeberg Park at sunset and walk along the muddy paths to find the viewpoint. The late winter sky is like a watercolour: soft blue and grey clouds layer together, with a sweeping gradient of yellow verging from tobacco stain to pale lemon above the distant, bruise-coloured hills. At the viewpoint, I look out over Oslo and listen for a scream.In 1892, Edvard Munch took a walk in this same park as the sun was setting. Recording the experience in his diary, he wrote that he heard “a great and infinite scream through nature”. The experience became the basis of his most enduring painting. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jb-restaurant",
    "description": "Janez Bratovž, aka JB, founded his eponymous, Michelin-recommended restaurant at a time when nouvelle cuisine was unknown in Yugoslavia. He learned his trade in Austria and introduced specialties like carpaccio and foams to a land of hearty but simple dishes.  He’s been described as the godfather of fine dining in this part of the world and while Ana Roš is the highest profile Slovenian chef, her flagship restaurant is in a rural area near the Italian border, and JB has led the way here in the capital for decades. JB develops sophisticated dishes based on the best local ingredients he can find, many of them indigenous: from trdinka (a red corn varietal) to blackstrap pigs (considered to have the best fat of any breed), from pumpkinseed oil (of around 800 varietals of pumpkin only this one, styriaca, yields delicious oil when cold pressed, and it’s native to Slovenia) to Soča River trout (the world’s largest and considered to have the tastiest flesh).  While he’s cooked for Pope Francis and Ferran Adrià, he is technically retired, though he’s still in the kitchen most days. His son, Tomaz, has taken over the kitchen while his daughter, Nina, is sommelier, and his wife, Ema, manages the restaurant—it’s truly a family affair. The food is soulful, sophisticated, and personal. Take, for example, one of JB’s famous dishes, which simply consists of a fresh egg cooked at the table by pouring pork cracklings over it.  This is JB’s Proustian moment—he grew up so poor that a big treat was a single fried egg that his grandmother would make him once a week. But the must-try is his signature dish: ravioli with foie gras, pistachio, and chestnut foam and veal jus. And in case you were wondering, the restaurant is in a building designed by none other than Slovenia’s most famous architect, Joze Plečnik, as the headquarters of Triglav Insurance Company.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/holocaust-vault-quezon-city",
    "description": "On August 21, 1937, Philippine President Manuel Quezon issued Proclamation No. 173, initiating an open-door policy for the country so that it could receive persecuted Jews fleeing Europe. Under this program, the local Jewish community in the Philippines assumed responsibility for the refugees, ensuring they would not burden the local community. The same year, the Jewish Refugee Committee (JRC) was established. The program was selective; only refugees with ‘desirable’ professions such as doctors and scientists, along with their families, were prioritized and eventually granted visas. From 1938 on, the Philippines welcomed over 1,300 Jews from Germany and Austria. President Quezon even used his residence, Marikina Hall, to receive refugees. This proclamation later became the basis of Commonwealth Act 613, later known as the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940. Thousands more refugees could have been rescued has the United States government not imposed a limit of 1,000 Jews per year over a 10-year period. The Philippines continued to receive Jewish refugees until December 8, 1941, when Japan attacked the country. These refugees, who came to be known as ‘Manilaners,’ stayed until after the war before relocating to the United States. President Quezon safeguarded the documents related to the special immigration program, including travel documents and refugee passports, in a special vault at his home. He was the only person who was authorized to access it. His house, along with the vault, was relocated to the Quezon City Memorial Circle. The vault is now placed in a ground-floor room previously used by Aurora Quezon, the President’s wife, in her later years. In 2015, the Quezon Heritage House was designated as a Local Heritage Site by the Quezon City government.",
