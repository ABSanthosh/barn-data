    "description": "By travelling car-free we became fully immersed in the area’s quieter attractions, with cosy stays and great food throughoutPulling a wheelie case along the stone streets of Bath, I feel I may as well be wearing a sign reading “tourist on a mini-break”. But when we check in to the Roseate Villa – a 15-minute trundle from the station – and the man who greets us asks for our car registration, I get a virtuous glow from saying we’ve come by train (causing less than a third of the carbon emissions as well as less congestion in the Georgian city, though I don’t point that out).This is our first stop on a wholly car-free foodie tour arranged through Sawday’s and sustainable travel platform Byway. After Bath, we’ll head further south in Somerset to Frome, then take in Bradford-on-Avon and Lacock in Wiltshire, with train times and tickets all sorted for us. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Only a few miles but a world away from overcrowded Snowdon, the quieter paths and rugged slopes of the Rhinogydd offer a walk on the region’s wildest mountainAs soon as I stepped within the stone circle of Cerrig Arthur, the strange noise began. It came from the far side of the valley – a long, hoarse scream. Then it became louder, growing into an ear-splitting thunder. I jammed my fingers into my ears – but still felt its sonic explosion down in my stomach. The cloud lay low over the stone circle that evening, so it was impossible to tell where the terrible sound was coming from. I might have half-imagined that Cerrig Arthur had unleashed some ancient sorcery, or that this was the return of the legendary king the circle is named for.But really, I knew what it was. Military training flights often pass over these Gwynedd hills. The roar was a jet fighter streaking right over my head. The disturbance was quickly over. In truth, there were few people to disturb.

    "description": "This grave is located in the churchyard of St. Mary the Virgin in Berkeley, Gloucestershire. Dicky Pearce was the last court jester to be employed in England. Born in 1665, he was employed by the Berkeley family at Berkeley Castle, and worked directly for the Earl of Suffolk. According to the legend, Dicky had insulted one of Lord Berkeley’s guests earlier in the evening, and they were quite offended by it. While playing the hurdy gurdy, high above the hall in the Minstrel’s Gallery, falling to his death.  There is a question there though… would such an accomplished musician and jester fall from a space he was undoubtedly familiar with, or was he pushed in retaliation for his earlier words? That’s a secret that Dicky (and anyone else up in the Minstrel’s Gallery with him that night) took to his grave.",

    "description": "Portland, Maine, is a quirky city known for its lobster, beer, and sprawling art scene. Eagle-eyed dwellers may notice murals, art installations and sculptures can be found scattered about, including a curious, oversized metal structure in the middle of the popular Deering Oaks Park. This sculpture depicts Maine's state flower: a white pine cone. It was crafted from repurposed steel shovels by Maine artist Patrick Plourde, and donated to the public art permanent collection in tribute to Alice Spencer, founder of TEMPOArt—a local entity that supports temporary and permanent art installations throughout the city. Pinecone serves to recognize Alice's contributions in establishing Portland as a city rich in public art.",
