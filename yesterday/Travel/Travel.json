    "description": "From the Surrey Hills to the Hebrides, hostels offer affordable lodgings in some of the UK’s most beautiful landscapes. Here are our readers’ top picksFour decades after my previous visit to Eskdale YHA (a scary night-time descent from Scafell), a nostalgic multi-day trek saw me back in one of Lakeland’s quieter hostels. The building’s exterior is unchanged, but, within, I found improved comfort levels and a cheery welcome from Rachel’s dedicated team. After a tasty pie and a decent pint, enjoyed among relaxed company of all generations, I stepped outside to gaze at the surrounding fells bathed in moonlight and wrapped in silence. There’s a bird hide in the grounds and red squirrels visit to feed. And, yes, I walked up Scafell from the hostel’s door. It’s £15 per night per adult in a shared dorm.Paul Gamble Continue reading...",

    "description": "Less than an hour from Rome, Nepi and the northern Lazio region is an under-the-radar cultural and historic hub – and councillors are working with the local community to welcome more visitorsStanding on the top of the huge fortress, looking over the rolling landscape, it’s easy to see why Nepi was a prized possession for Roman emperors, medieval popes and Renaissance dynasties. Defended on two sides by river channels and with a commanding position over rich agricultural land and abundant water springs, the town, less than an hour north of Rome, has been a witness and a contributor to history for over two millennia.Much of that history has been marked by intrigue, violence and war. Most famously, Nepi was ruled by the 15th-century Spanish cardinal Rodrigo Borgia, who gave it to his daughter Lucrezia after he became Pope Alexander VI. Lucrezia stayed at the fortress (today known as the Borgia Castle) following the murder of her second husband in 1500. These days, things are a lot more laid-back. I’m sitting outside the Bar Centrale in the town’s elegant Piazza del Comune, facing the imposing town hall, built on the orders of the Farnese family after they took up residence here in the mid-1500s. With me is Paolo Paoletti, who has just been elected for a second term as Nepi’s councillor responsible for culture and tourism. While I sip an espresso and tuck into a cream-filled pastry, Paolo tells me about his plans to develop tourism here and across the Tuscia region. Continue reading...",

The village has medieval Ottoman architecture built on a hillside, with stone houses, narrow streets, and fortress in the top of the hill that gives you an amazing panoramic view from the region. The town was first mentioned on records from the 15th century, but it was likely founded even earlier, in the late 14th century. Počitelj played a significant role in controlling access along the Neretva River and was an important administrative and military center during the Ottoman period. Some importants places of Počitelj are the Počitelj Fortress, Sahat Kula (Clock Tower), Šišman Ibrahim Pasha Mosque, Hammam (Turkish Bath).",

    "description": "Founded in 1337, Ryūkō-ji Temple is located atop a hill overlooking Enoshima Island. The name, also read as Tatsu-no-kuchi, means \"dragon-mouth\" in Japanese, referring to the local legend of a dragon whose body formed the terrain. In the Middle Ages, from the Kamakura period (1185–1333) to the Muromachi period (1336–1573), the site served as major execution grounds. It is particularly famous for the Tatsunokuchi Hōnan incident, in which Buddhist saint Nichiren was nearly beheaded here in 1260 but spared when an orb of light came flying from Enoshima and distracted the executioner. Notable executions done at Tatsunokuchi include those of To Seichu, an ambassador from the Yuan state, as well as the rebel samurai Hōjō Tokiyuki. Historical records also mention numerous executions and \"head identifications\" done in Katase and Koshigoe, possibly referring to the site.",
