    "description": "As a new series of The Great Pottery Throwdown hits the screens, an honorary Stokie explores Josiah Wedgwood’s legacy and the six towns – and gets some clay on her handsAs a lump of damp clay spins frantically on the potter’s wheel, I tentatively ease my fingers around it, hoping it will soon resemble a pot. Thankfully, there are two instructors leading the six of us on this hour-long taster session, to offer guidance and, in my case, rescue a collapsing pile of clay. I glance at the others’ creations – elegant vases and bowls – and then at mine, which looks more like a volcano. Still, I’m impressed with myself for creating something resembling pottery, and it’s been fun to get stuck in.I’ve wanted to try throwing a pot since moving to Stoke-on-Trent 14 years ago, and here at World of Wedgwood, I’ve finally given it a go (taster session £32.50). Channel Four’s The Great Pottery Throw Down is filmed at Gladstone Pottery Museum in Longton, one of the six towns that make up Stoke-on-Trent. World famous for its ceramics, Stoke was awarded World Craft City status last July, and 2025 brings a year of events to celebrate 100 years since it became a city. As an honorary Stokie, it seems like the perfect time to discover more of my adopted hometown. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bendhu",
    "description": "Architect Newton Penprase, originally from Cornwall, started building this house in 1936. Intended for Penprase himself to live in, the house's name \"Bendhu\" was borrowed from that of a nearby coastal feature. Construction lasted about 20 years in total, including extensions by two other architects. Started at a time when currents like Art Deco and Art Nouveau were in vogue, the house's structure is quite unique, as it resembles a hodgepodge of white geometric shapes smashed together, the color only broken by its many windows. Its appearance isn't the only thing setting it apart from other nearby buildings. Lime and stone were the traditional construction materials in the area, but Penprase favored concrete instead. Its long construction time led to it earning the nickname (among others), \"the House That Was Never Finished,\" apparently due to its owner's tendency to constantly tinker with it. Newton Penprase died in 1978, and the current owners took over Bendhu in 1993, the year after it had already been recognized as a Listed Building. Apparently, the house is as peculiar inside as its exterior and the owners have strived to conserve as much of it as possible. Bendhu's uniqueness has led to at least one book being written about its construction and it is likely one of the best sources regarding the evolution of the house's interior, during Penprase's time and beyond.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sacromonte-abbey",
    "description": "Between 1594 and 1606, people discovered Roman-era underground ovens in the hills to the west of Granada, Spain. Within one of these underground ovens, people found a set of “lead books” (libros plúmbeos) consisting of sheets of lead with Arabic, Hebrew, and Latin text as well as many mystical symbols, all of which were bound together with wire. These lead books described the Arabic origins of Christianity in Spain and tried to reconcile the cultural differences among the various people who lived in the country before the Reconquista. The people who discovered the books also found the remains of multiple individuals within the caves, and the lead books indicated that three of the deceased people were St. Cecilius (San Cicilio) and two of his companions. St. Cecilius had been bishop of the Roman city located at the site of modern-day Granada, and he and his companions had been martyred during the persecution of Christians under Emperor Nero. These discoveries made the location into a pilgrimage site, and eventually, an abbey was built at the caves’ location. Most of the current complex dates to the seventeenth century and features multiple structures including a large collegiate church, several courtyards including a large central cloister, and an entrance to the holy caves underneath.  The caves contain multiple chambers, some of which function as chapels and one of which is the site where St. Cecilius’s remains were found. Six-pointed stars, which appeared very prominently in the lead books, also appear as a very common motif in the architecture around the complex. The abbey has undergone many changes over the years and now also functions in part as a museum. Several rooms have been devoted to describing the history of the abbey, and one of the courtyards features multiple sculptures by the modern artist Venancio Blanco depicting many religious figures and scenes, including the Last Supper and Jesus on the cross. In the centuries since their discovered, the Lead Books of Sacramonte, as they have come to be known, have attracted a lot of curiosity and controversy. Many scholars have debated whether the books were authentic or forgeries. In 1682, they were officially declared to be heretical. Even so, the Sacromonte Abbey, which currently houses the books, still functions as a place of worship and still attracts many visitors who want to learn about the history of Christianity in Granada.",
