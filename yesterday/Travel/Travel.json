    "description": "The Northumberland line will soon return passenger services linking Newcastle to coastal towns such as Blyth, giving a much-needed boost to the regionSome of Northumberland’s attractive coastal towns, wild countryside and interior villages are about to become more accessible thanks to a new railway line from Newcastle to Ashington set to open in December. Coupled with the Tyne and Wear Metro receiving its first new fleet of trains in more than 40 years, visitors without a car will find travelling around the county so much easier.Arriving into Newcastle by train from the south provides a spectacular aerial tour of the Tyne Gorge, which is crossed by seven bridges in short succession and densely packed with buildings spilling down the banks.

    "description": "On a rail trip to Spain from the UK via Paris, our writer discovers a great way of travelling happily with children …Street lights strobed through the window, sending shadows sweeping across our faces as our train followed the River Seine through Choisy-le-Roi. Ten minutes earlier, we had pulled out of Paris’s Gare d’Austerlitz. Departing at 9.40pm, the Intercité de Nuit was due on the Spanish border just after 10am, where we would connect to a Barcelona train.It’s possible to make the journey from London in a day, but my husband and I had added a stopover to give our two daughters – aged six and four – a whistlestop tour of the French capital, an indulgent lunch and a night on a sleeper train. Travelling with children was once a stop-start nightmare of whingeing for snacks, but instead of fighting them, I’d learned to embrace it by turning each journey into a voyage of gastronomic discovery.

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/1904-worlds-fair-swedish-pavilion",
    "description": "With its cheery yellow exterior and distinct slopping roofs, the Swedish Pavilion is architect Ferdinand Boberg's only international exposition building still standing. It is also the only example of this distinct architectural style in the United States.  The building boasts the design of a traditional Swedish Manor House, or herrgård, and honors the architectural past of Sweden. The pavilion was built as an international exposition building for the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair, also known as the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, and is one of only two international buildings from the event still in existence. When the fair closed, W.W. Thomas, the U.S. Minister to Sweden and Norway, purchased the Swedish Pavilion and presented it to Bethany College. It served as a classroom, library, museum, and art department for more than 60 years under Swedish-born artist Birger Sandzén.  In 1969, the Swedish Pavilion was moved from Bethany College to the Lindsborg Old Mill and Swedish Heritage Museum on the south side of town, and some restoration was completed. The Pavilion is used for cultural heritage events throughout the year, including Heritage Christmas, Midsummer's Festival, Svensk Hyllningsfest (in odd-numbered years), and the Legend of Sleepy Hollow performances (in even-numbered years). The building was entered into the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.  Now, the museum sits on 15 acres along the Smoky Hill River and is accompanied by the 1898 Smoky Valley Roller Mills building, also on the National Register of Historic Places, as well as another eight historic buildings.  Today, the Pavilion's future is uncertain. In October 2023, an engineering assessment found that the pavilion is leaning by up to 2 degrees. This tilt is obvious even to the untrained eye and considered severe. Due to fear of structural collapse, the building is currently closed until updates can be made.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/garbasaurus",
    "description": "Hidden in Guelph's Royal City Park, Garbasaurus is a six-foot-tall sculpture made entirely from garbage, commemorating the Ontario Public Interest Research Group’s (OPIRG) Speed River Cleanup. Created in 1999 by artist Greg Elliott, the statue weighs 647 pounds—the same amount of trash removed from the Speed and Eramosa rivers during the cleanup’s first year in 1979. Originally envisioned as a heron, the sculpture evolved into a dinosaur-like figure as Elliott incorporated discarded materials like tires, scrap metal, and hubcaps, reflecting the types of debris found during the cleanup. Then-Mayor Karen Farbridge recalled how the community quickly dubbed the sculpture Garbasaurus, embracing its whimsical, prehistoric look. Though tucked away across from the Boathouse, Garbasaurus holds a special place in Royal City Park. The location is where volunteers gather each year for the river cleanup, making it a fitting tribute to the city’s ongoing environmental efforts. Over the years, the sculpture has faced vandalism and natural wear, requiring multiple repairs, including a significant restoration in 2018 to reinforce its head and neck. Despite these challenges, Garbasaurus continues to stand as a testament to Guelph’s commitment to environmental activism, reminding passersby that even trash can be transformed into something inspiring.",
