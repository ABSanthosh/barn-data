    "description": "From a traditional bonbon shop to a hidden jazz club, our tipsters share their favourite haunts in the City of LightOf all the chocolatiers’ windows in Paris, Au Chat Bleu at 85 Boulevard Haussmann never fails to lure me in. It reminds me of an old-fashioned sweet shop I thought only existed in England – but it’s also very, very French. It brims with seasonal specialities and delicacies you never knew existed, alongside traditional pâtes de fruits, colourful bonbons in jars and novelties, such as the chocolate bouchées inspired by the founders’ beloved Blue Persian cats. The perfect place to stock up on gifts to bring back from your travels (or simply treat yourself). Eleanor Continue reading...",

There, a bright red spider web; here, some luminescent fungi; now a twinkling tortoise, Timothy, sheltering by the wall. I am exploring the gardens of Gilbert White’s House in Selborne, Hampshire, which is holding a light trail with a difference this month.Gilbert White (1720-1793) is considered the father of ecology, one of the first people to observe living creatures in their own habitats, rather than studying dead specimens. He discovered the role of earthworms; developed the idea of the food chain; and identified species including the harvest mouse, noctule bat, chiffchaff, wood warbler and willow warbler.

    "description": "Animal trainer John King, of the John Robinson Circus, was killed on September 27, 1880, after being crushed by an elephant. The elephant, known as Chief, had a reputation for being unruly. His murderous behavior was blamed on surging testosterone from musth, a breeding cycle that male elephants go through periodically. While the circus was in Charlotte for performances, Chief rammed King into his railcar cage, crushing him—the impact reportedly broke every bone in his body. Chief then started to rampage, but other circus workers managed to capture him and tie him to his mate, a larger female elephant named Mary, to get him back under control. After this incident, Chief was sent to a zoo in Cincinnati. He is reported to have killed two additional people before being put down by a firing squad in 1890. His body was then made into steaks served at a local restaurant. His skin and skeleton were stuffed and put on display at the University of Cincinnati. Eventually, the skeleton was sent to the Cincinnati Museum Center, where it remains.",

    "description": "Te Aro Pā was once the largest pa, a Maori settlement, in New Zealand, encompassing about 40-60 acres by the 1840s. Due to earthquakes, the Taranaki land wars, and colonization, the settlement's population dwindled in size with most of the land sold off by the 1900s. In 1908, a building was erected over this site, obscuring the remains for over 100 years.  In 2005, renovations to the site for the construction of an apartment building uncovered the remains of two whare ponga (Maori residential buildings) and other archaeological items. This discovery is the only known remains of Te Aro Pā and is considered extremely rare due to the Maori's use of natural ecological building materials that degrade over time.",
