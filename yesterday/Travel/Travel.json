It’s easy to say the word quietly. Here in the national capital of this tasty perennial the stalks are – right now – growing, blushing, sweetening silently in the dark. The harvest season starts in mid-February, when shed doors are prised open and the gathering-in commences, by candlelight. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Raft houses, known as ‘splavs’, became synonymous with the hedonistic nightclub scene in Serbia’s capital. Now they are being cleared from the river to make way for luxury flats, bars and shopsFor 20 years, the raft bar Zappa Barka sat on the Sava river in central Belgrade. Revellers walked a gangplank to board the boat, then danced to live music and DJs on wooden floors, or stayed on deck all night to see the sun rise over the water. But in June 2024 the raft’s electricity supply was suddenly cut, and the barge was towed to a new destination far from the city centre.Zappa’s existence was always unstable, but there was a sense of exception in Belgrade. That’s because this boat bar was one of Belgrade’s “splavs”, raft houses that have been built on Belgrade’s two rivers, the Danube and the Sava, since the 1960s. Locals use them in summer as waterside retreats, gathering with friends for barbecues when temperatures can hit 38C. Families buy their moorings for 99 years and can renovate their raft house within certain parameters. Continue reading...",

    "description": "It’s close to midnight. You’re stepping out of a Broadway theater and into the neon hellscape of Times Square. You’re hungry, and too dignified (and/or sober) to wait two hours for a slice of Joe’s Pizza. The Olive Garden, Hard Rock Cafe, and Margaritaville don’t enthrall you, despite their ability to seduce out-of-town masses. The Rum House, a perpetually mobbed piano bar, will require you to beg and bribe your way in. What’s a patron of the Midtown-based arts to do? We say make a beeline for Grand Central Station. No, you’re not fleeing, you’re dining. Admittedly, most of the city’s major transit hubs are not places where one would dine by choice. And yet, this 1913 Beaux Arts architectural masterpiece is home to two very good restaurants. It’s too late in the evening to visit the century-old Grand Central Oyster Bar, but you’re just in time for dinner at Grand Brasserie. This 400-cover, 16,000-square-foot restaurant opened in 2024, but you’d swear it had always been here. Situated under the cavernous, chandeliered ceilings of Vanderbilt Hall, this classically French restaurant is open 5:30 a.m. to 2 a.m., seven days a week, and the kitchen stays open right until the bitter end. Given that 750,000-odd souls pass through this hall on a daily basis, Grand Brasserie could easily have coasted on location and looks alone, which makes its food as much of a surprise as it is a delight. The menu of bistro heavy-hitters by chef Guillaume Thivetwhich encourages cosplaying life in the Gilded Age, and we’d recommend the leeks vinaigrette, crab persillade, and skirt steak au poivre to help get you in character.  If you’re hoping to play robber baron for an hour or so (we encourage this wholeheartedly), get the lobster frites. It comes bathed in shamrock-hued persillade butter and cleaved in two, the claw meat removed so that aspiring aristocrats need not dirty their fingers. Two hungry diners could easily split it, particularly if you dunk the accompanying crisp, slender fries in said butter. It’s a fittingly decadent way to leave New York, or just to pretend you live in a different version of it.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/edison-bamboo",
    "description": "Thomas Edison is commonly credited as the inventor of the incandescent lightbulb, if somewhat controversially. Historians would agree that several scientists had invented working lightbulbs before Edison, and that the American inventor merely improved the functionality and reliability, getting his version patented. In school, Japanese children are often taught what a great figure he was, but they are seldom taught that the Japanese bamboo contributed greatly to the development of Edison's electric lamp. In 1860, Joseph Swann invented an earlier prototype of a lightbulb. It had a filament made of carbon that could only produce light for a short time—not long enough to be useful in providing light. To improve the longevity, Edison experimented with numerous materials including paper, cotton, linen, and wood. He tested more than 6,000 different materials as filaments, collecting specimens from across the globe. A filament made using Japanese bamboo found at the Iwashimizu-Hachimangu Shrine in Kyoto held a record of over 1,200 hours. Meanwhile, in Japan, the Hakunetsu-sha Company (today known as Toshiba) succeeded in creating a functional incandescent lightbulb using the exact same sort of bamboo. This was in 1890, 11 years after Edison's \"invention.\" In 1976, the Toshiba Science Museum was gifted a specimen of the \"Edison Bamboo\" by Iwashimizu-Hachimangu Shrine. It now stands in front of the museum, an often-overlooked public exhibit.",
