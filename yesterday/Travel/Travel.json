    "description": "From unexpected city charms in Rabat to the dunes of the Sahara and a festival celebrating nomadic life, our tipsters share their best discoveriesThe calm city of Khenifra is well worth a detour from the main tourist routes of Morocco. It enjoys a lovely location on the banks of the Oum Er-Rbia river and is surrounded by the Atlas mountains, which keep the air fresh, clean and invigorating for strolling around. It’s also just a short bus ride away from the Khenifra national park. I spent two days hiking there enjoying beautiful lakeside walks breathing in the fragrances of the Atlas cedar trees. Don’t miss the source of the Oum Er-Rbia and its gentle waterfall, tumbling down the reddish rocks. Joe Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/viking-longboat",
    "description": "Upon the River Anton as it passes through Andover, a Viking vessel stands as a whimsical reminder of a far less peaceful era when Norse raiders struck fear into the heart of Anglo-Saxon England. This ship is neither a museum piece, nor a meticulous reconstruction, but rather a blend of public art, local history, and floral fancy. Rather than cleaving the waves of the North Sea primed to pillage, Andover’s longboat began its life as something far more delicate: a flower display for the Test Valley in Bloom Millennium celebrations.  The sculpture remembers the relationship between Olaf Tryggvason and the town. In the late 10th century, the Norseman and his raiding parties proved such a persistent threat that King Ethelred was compelled to pay a substantial sum of tribute money, Danegeld, to appease the Vikings, and protect the kingdom. In addition to this, Olaf became a Christian and was baptized in Andover, vowing never to invade England again.  In 2022, weathered steel figures ‘boarded’ the ship as part of a regeneration of the area around the town's mills. The figures were each inspired by authentic Norse depictions found on excavated coins and Viking artifacts.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-world-time-today",
    "description": "Within a wall of London’s bustling Piccadilly Circus Underground Station, a curious contraption circumnavigates the globe. The result of a collaboration between architect Charles Holden and John Mowlem \u0026 Company, ‘The World Time Today’ was integrated into the station during its expansion and redesign in 1928. This unique linear clock features a westward-scrolling time band across the equator that moves at the same pace as the Earth's rotation, tracking the passage of time across the globe. Small illuminated light bulbs draw attention to select cities: London, Cape Town, Sydney, New York, Victoria (Canada), and Buenos Aires, a symbol of the burgeoning global consciousness of the interwar period,   Though the timepiece doesn’t provide pinpoint accuracy due to the varying nature of global time zones, The World Time Today is fascinating to watch. Since the map remains as it was in the 1920s, it is curious to admire as a record of the geopolitics of the early 20th century.",
