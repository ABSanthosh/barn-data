    "description": "Come for wonderful walks on Box Hill and the Happy Valley trail, stay for cosy inns, great food and a sense of discoveryIf Surrey were a restaurant, it would be a drive-thru. Sandwiched between London and England’s south coast, famous for its wealthy commuter-belt towns and the great thick scar of the M25, it’s a place people whip through on their way to somewhere else. I’ve spent several decades doing it; back and forth between Sussex and London, occasionally meeting friends in Guildford or Dorking, but never really exploring any further.My husband and I had our first date in a pub in the Surrey Hills (an AONB since 1958, the second in the country) – the lovely Fox Revived at Norwood Hill – and I remember thinking at the time, “Oh, this is quite pretty.” A decade later, sitting in the same pub, and slightly less distracted by first-date nerves, I decided it was somewhere I really should get to know.

Our writer wonders if this is the future for winter resortsThe first sign we’re heading into the wild, having left the cosy confines of our resort for a ski touring taster, comes when three mountain goats jump in front of the car, eyeball us skittishly, then launch themselves off a vertiginous drop to our left.My 14-year-old son, in the passenger seat beside me, curses loudly, and I take a deep breath. We drive on, navigating some serious hairpin bends, before arriving in Montespluga, which sits at an altitude of almost 2,000 metres in the Lombardy region of the Italian Alps, about two-and-a-half hours’ drive from Milan.

    "description": "Standing as a fitting centerpiece for the Palouse to Cascades Trail State Park, the Beverly Bridge offers visitors the ability to peacefully take in the Columbia River and its surrounding environment. This 3,000-foot-long former railroad bridge, built in 1909, now serves as a non-motorized pathway crossing America’s fourth-largest river. In the early 20th century, the Pacific Extension of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul \u0026 Pacific Railroad (also known as the Milwaukee Road) was constructed. It was abandoned in 1980, however, and the Beverly Bridge—with its associated right-of-way—was acquired by the state of Washington in lieu of back taxes. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, but otherwise remained derelict for decades. A 2014 wildfire even destroyed the wood decking that was still left on the bridge. Meanwhile, the rest of the Milwaukee Road right-of-way was being repurposed as a “rails-to-trails” corridor open to non-motorized traffic, now called the Palouse to Cascades State Park Trail. The Beverly Bridge was called a “pivotal connection” between the east and west halves of the trail, and support grew for refurbishing it for non-motorized traffic. In the late 2010s, the Washington state legislature appropriated money for its reconstruction. The bridge was reopened on April 8, 2022. The refurbishment included adding guardrails and a concrete deck consisting of prefabricated slabs. Several overhanging viewpoints with benches over the Columbia River were also included in the refit. These highlight one of the most attractive features of the Beverly Bridge: its lack of motorized traffic. Here, you can sit on one of the benches, admire the contrast of the desert in the hills around Sentinel Gap downstream with the wide blue river, along with the additional incongruity of the agricultural developments here and there alongside the river. Or you can gaze upstream toward Wanapum Dam, with the edge of the Yakima Firing Range, all still desert, off to the west. Furthermore, the location of the Beverly Bridge, just downstream of Wanapum Dam, preserves much of the flavor of the undammed river, as the bridge is mostly upstream of the reservoir backed up by Priest Rapids Dam.",

    "title": "Xochimilco Raised Fields in Mexico City, Mexico",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/xochimilco-raised-fields",
    "description": "In pre-Columbian times, the Valley of Mexico, where modern-day Mexico City is located, used to have a series of five lakes, occupying an area of approximately 114,000 hectares. This area is located within an endorheic basin, meaning that all the rainfall accumulates within Mexico Valley, with no natural outflow to the sea. The area was a highly biodiverse environment full of aquatic species, including the famous axolotl. Complex societies were able to thrive under these conditions by developing an ingenious system to exploit the local conditions to their maximum: raised field agriculture. This raised field agriculture, known as chinampas in Nahuatl, is an agricultural system where artificial islands are created with consecutive layers of branches and mud relatively close to the water column (less than a meter in altitude). This allows plant roots to have direct access to moisture supplied by capillary action from the water column. As a result, the chinampas created a year-round water supply for crops with no need for irrigation and supplied constant moisture during the dry season. Centuries ago, farmers would navigate the maze-like channel system via canoes in order to transport their harvest. Extremely nutrient-rich mud from the channel bottom was used to germinate seeds and supply the chinampas with a natural in-situ fertilizer. Trees were planted along the chinampa edges for stabilization and wood for fuel. The root system of these trees reached the channels, serving as breeding grounds for aquatic species such as crayfish, axolotls, and fish, which were harvested by local populations as well. Chinampas are considered one of the most productive pre-industrial agricultural systems known. This system is at least a thousand years old, being used by different societies that populated the lake edges. However, when the Mexicas arrived and founded the city of Tenochtitlan (the capital of the Aztec Empire) on a series of small islands in modern-day Mexico City's downtown, they used the local chinampa system to connect these islands and increase the livable area of the city itself. Archeologists believe that the city may have reached a population of 200,000, a feat of urban expansion enabled by this sophisticated system of food production. After the Spanish conquest of Mesoamerica and during colonial times, and even after the independence of Mexico the system, chinampas was the main supplier of food for Mexico City and the surrounding towns and villages within the valley. Since colonial times, there were many engineering projects aimed at draining the lakes and diverting water inflows out of the valley, which slowly dissected the lakes from the XVI century onwards. During the late XIX and early XX, the southeast of Mexico City still had a considerably large area with highly productive chinampas that supplied food to the city. From the early XX century onward, the water level fell, and the thriving chinampa agriculture quickly transformed into conventional agriculture, and eventually transformed into the concrete jungle of Mexico City's urban expansion. However, a few places south of the city managed to escape the crush of development, Xochimilco being the biggest and best preserved. Despite considerable pressures such as urban wastewater pollution, invasive species, and reliance on fertilizer use in local agriculture, Xochimilco stands as a remnant of how the ancient city of Tenochtitlan and the surrounding area of the valley used to look. Many of the chinampas and channels within Xochimilco have been active and constantly used until this day, some before the arrival of the Spanish empire. Xochimilco, although is now surrounded by Mexico City, still houses an impressive amount of biodiversity, including many local and migratory birds and aquatic species, and of course, the local chinampa system is well and alive.",
