    "description": "Lost Shore Surf Resort near Edinburgh is Europe’s largest wave pool and there are few better places to learn this exhilarating sportThe sun splashes off the lagoon and I shield my eyes to see the wave rushing up behind me. I’m lying on my big foam surfboard in perfect position as it arrives. “Three big paddle strokes to catch the wave,” is what my instructor, Owen, had told me. I do just that, pop up and voilà: I’m surfing, arms out, gliding, grinning, sailing, slipping, falling flat on my face, hard into the water.I stand back up, unable to suppress a seismic smile and shake myself off like a wet dog. Owen gives me a high five and a few tips on my dodgy footwork, and I paddle back out to try again. Continue reading...",

    "description": "County Clare’s dramatic shoreline is the backdrop to Loop Head Lighthouse and its two holiday cottages. Binoculars for sea viewing included – but not wifiWe cross a narrow strip of land under vast skies and follow a slim road. It cuts a straight line through the heart of County Clare’s only peninsula – a jagged spearhead-shaped piece of land that dangles downward, like a tail, right into the Atlantic. The landscape tapers as the mouth of the River Shannon appears to the south, and the ocean to the north, until we reach the tip of the spear at what seems to be the very edge of the world; and there it stands, defiant and elevated on an outcrop – Loop Head Lighthouse.From some point in childhood, my introverted self romanticised the role of a lightkeeper. Maybe it was Robert Eggers’ psychological thriller The Lighthouse (2019) that wreaked havoc with that elysium, but a lightkeeper’s cottage rental offered a flavour of the experience without the carnage.

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tri-states-monument-new-york",
    "description": "Full disclosure: The Tri-States Monument does not, as is sometimes claimed, actually mark the location where the boundaries of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania meet. The confusion is understandable; the bronze United States Coast and Geodetic survey disc and scored granite marker give the appearance of authority and precision. However, as the nearby Witness Monument makes clear, the state boundaries actually intersect about 475 feet west of the Tri-States Monument, in the middle of the Delaware River. If you are particularly literal, you have been warned. Also known as the Tri-States Rock, the monument was set in place in 1942, replacing earlier, less permanent, or damaged markers. Approximately a half cubic yard in size above bedrock, \"Tri-States Monument\" is chiseled into the north face. The top is engraved with the initials of the three states and grooves symbolically representing the state boundaries. The federal survey disc, a triangulation station now under the jurisdiction of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, dates from the same year. Like the Tri-States Monument, the Witness Monument 25 feet away was originally engraved in 1882 and placed at its current location in 1942. \"Boundary Monument\" and the earlier date are inscribed on what is also called the Reference Monument, along with verbal descriptions of the marker’s location relative to the Tri-States Monument and the true tripoint of the three states. Also noted for posterity are the names of three New Jersey and three New York commissioners, as well as the surveyors from each state, who certified the two monuments’ locations. The granite markers are located on what is known as Carpenter’s Point, the tip of a short peninsula between the Delaware and Neversink rivers that is home to the Laurel Grove Cemetery, established in 1856. Aside from its geopolitical significance, Carpenter’s Point is—the traffic overhead on Interstate-84 notwithstanding—a peaceful place to view the Delaware River.",

    "description": "Sequoias are a marvel of nature. They're some of the largest living beings on the planet, towering above every other type of tree. (A giant sequoia nicknamed General Sherman holds the title of the largest tree in the world by volume). Because these trees take millennia to grow, and only do so in very specific climates, many were skeptical that they even existed. One specific tree was chosen to aid with that in 1891. It was a 300-foot (91-meter) giant sequoia called Mark Twain, after the American author. The tree stood at the edge of the then-new Sequoia National Park. With a trunk that measured 16 feet (4.9 meters) in diameter, Mark Twain was one of the last remaining giants in the grove. While felling trees in this area was not allowed at this point, an exception was made for this tree for scientific reasons. Namely, many people did not believe that a tree that large could actually exist. Lumbermen cut down the tree, a job that took nearly two weeks. They prepared sections from the thickest part of the tree to be shipped out. One segment ended up in New York's American Museum of Natural History, and the other was sent to the Natural History Museum in London. Both pieces are still on display, dispelling all doubt of the existence of sequoias. However, these two cuts are not the only remnants of the tree, as the stump that was left behind remains in its original location. Equipped with a little staircase, the stump is a popular photo spot, as it is the most accessible of all the stumps in the area, as well as the biggest.",
