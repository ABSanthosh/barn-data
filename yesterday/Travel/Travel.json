    "description": "Birthplace of vermouth, grissini and espresso, the north Italian city is a fitting host for the annual World’s 50 Best Restaurants ceremony on 19 June. But you don’t need to have deep pockets to enjoy its great food sceneMany renowned dining destinations have hosted the annual “food Oscars” – the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list. This year is the first time the honour goes to Italy, with Turin, capital of Piedmont, holding the ceremony on 19 June. Although Emilia-Romagna is usually regarded as the country’s food capital, Piedmont has a proud gastronomic tradition, with white truffles, rice, chocolate, pastas and cheeses, not to mention wines such as barolo and barbaresco.Greener than most Italian cities, Turin, the former capital of Savoy and briefly capital of Italy, also has elegant piazzas, royal palaces, possibly Europe’s biggest outdoor market and the wide Po River for strolling, cycling and kayaking. It is where vermouth (see below), grissini breadsticks and espresso coffee were invented. Continue reading...",

    "description": "This people’s museum is crammed with curios donated by Dublin residents. A major facelift has added a library, archive and exhibition on ‘fearless women’There are certain museums around the world that go beyond their role of housing artefacts and somehow seem to act as portals to the past. The Frick Collection in New York and Marcel Proust’s cork-lined bedroom at the Musée Carnavalet in Paris both hum with a timeless energy that transcends the exhibits on display. The Little Museum of Dublin is also such a space.Within seconds of ascending the stairs of this beautiful four-storey Georgian townhouse at 15 St Stephen’s Green, a different era appears to take hold. The modern world disappears and I imagine myself back in Georgian times, when this red-bricked terrace was built along with so many of the beautiful squares and parks throughout the city centre.

    "description": "One of the first things newly indoctrinated New Yorkers learn is that the Manhattan sold to them by cinema is a lie. The many alleyways characters dash through are really just Cortland Alley over and over again. Carrie Bradshaw’s rent-controlled Upper East Side pad is in Greenwich Village (and the owner is so sick of influencers vamping in their Manolos that it’s blocked off). And Patrick Bateman’s murderous rampage was mostly shot in Toronto.  But if you’re looking to briefly inhabit that fantasy—one in which the girls from Girls and the friends from Friends could afford those apartments—you could do a whole lot worse than a visit to the Central Park Boathouse. First opened in the 1870s for well-heeled Victorians looking a post-gondola lunch, the Loeb Boathouse was completely redesigned as part of Robert Moses’ overhaul of the park in the 1950s. It fully reopened to diners in 2024, with its handsome limestone and red-brick walls and copper roof intact. While it’s undeniably touristy, it’s a far superior option to a horse-driven buggy ride around Central Park. And even though the sun-drenched terrace would be packed in summer if they were serving cat food, the menu here is admirably solid. The Parkerhouse rolls are warm, accompanied by whipped butter with plenty of flaky salt and the shrimp in the shrimp cocktail, while pricey, are suitably large. For dessert, the pavlova is lovely. Your best bet is to order a half-dozen oysters—raw or Rockefeller—and a glass of something cold, then pop on your sepia-toned sunnies and pretend you're sitting across from Meg Ryan in a Nora Ephron production. After all, even real New Yorkers deserve a break from reality sometimes.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ambuluwawa-tower",
    "description": "Ambuluwawa Tower is approximately 48 meters in height—not a record-breaking number, but quite remarkable when you consider how thin the tower becomes toward the top. The architectural style of the tower is unmistakably modern, but it also incorporates various features common to Buddhist stupas. The bottom part of the tower is featureless and slightly conical, with the base being slightly narrower than the top. Inside, several sets of staircases criss-cross and give access to the first and largest viewing platform. From this platform, the tower start thinning, and the stairs appear on the outside of the tower, giving access to smaller viewing platforms closer to the top. Curiously, the spiraling design of the tower does not follow a strict symmetrical or gradual progression. The size of the viewing platforms varies in a non-linear fashion, and the intervals between these platforms are also irregular. Furthermore, the stairs are characterized by uneven width and height, which is a reflection of the irregular way in which the tower tapers off to the top. The lack of symmetry and predictable patterns give Ambuluwawa Tower an unrefined, organic feel that blends perfectly with its surrounding.    The construction of Ambuluwawa Tower started in 1997 and was completed in 2006. It is the centerpiece of a multi-religious complex featuring a Buddhist temple, a Hindu kovil, a Muslim mosque, and a Christian church. In this setting, the tower is supposed to symbolize unity and tolerance.",
