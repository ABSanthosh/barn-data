    "description": "This megacity is like Hong Kong on steroids – a vertically sprawling, astonishing urban phenomenon that can only be understood in three dimensionsGoogle Maps can be unreliable at the best of times when you’re travelling in China, but in the southern megacity of Chongqing, a map of any kind turns out to be almost entirely useless. Built across a series of impossibly steep mountainsides and vertiginous valleys at the dramatic confluence of the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers, it is an astonishing urban phenomenon to behold – a vertically sprawling city that can only be understood in three dimensions. It is a place where neighbourhoods cling to cliffs, connected by elevated roads 20 storeys up in the air. Metro lines emerge from tunnels through the mountains, only to plunge straight through the middle of residential skyscrapers, which themselves sprout improbably from the sheer slopes. Something that looks close by on the map can turn out to be tens of storeys above or below you. And getting there usually makes for an exhilarating journey.I first found myself in Chongqing 10 years ago, almost by accident, after my first attempt to enter North Korea was abruptly quashed when Kim Jong Un decided to close the borders overnight, because of his fears that foreigners might bring in Ebola. Stranded in Beijing with time to kill, a photographer friend recommended we head south to Chongqing. “It’s like Hong Kong on steroids,” was enough to convince me.Nothing prepares you for the multi-level madness of this sprawling metropolitan region of 32 million people. Hong Kong might be known for its elevated walkways and urban escalators that zigzag up its steep slopes, but Chongqing takes this 3D cityscape to a whole new level. To get to places that looked like a couple of blocks away, I found myself taking steep staircases that led to underground escalators, then across walkways to lifts that ferried me up the side of a cliff. Cable cars swooshed past outdoor plazas, where what I thought was the ground level turned out to be the roof terrace of an office block, which plunged 30 storeys down into the valley below.

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/john-wayne-statue-beverly-hills",
    "description": "Born Marion Morrison in 1907, actor and icon John Wayne was well known for starring in films of the Western genre, including classics such as The Searchers, True Grit, Stagecoach, and Rio Grande, among many others. A few years after his passing in 1979, Wayne was immortalized through the construction of two Southern California statues, including this one in Beverly Hills. Commissioned in 1984 by the Great West Savings \u0026 Loan Bank—Wayne had appeared in television commercials for them in the 1970s—this full-size statue depicts Wayne as a cowboy on horseback, sitting in the saddle with his feet in the stirrups and hands on the reins. The statue, created by sculptor Harry Jackson, is 21 feet tall and weighs six tons. Originally it rotated on an 8-foot-high oval base, but drivers along busy Wilshire Boulevard were distracted by it, so the motor was removed. The original, colorful paint job was also changed to the current dark coating. Following a takeover, Great West sold the building to Larry Flynt’s Hustler organization in 1994, though the statue was not part of the deal. Flynt died in 2021, and while there have been talks at various times over the years about its removal or relocation, the sheer size and weight seem exponential in terms in cost, so it seems likely that John Wayne will remain. The other statue of Wayne is at the airport named in his honor in Santa Ana, Orange County. Created in bronze by Robert Summers, that one stands at 9 feet tall, and can be found in the lobby of the Thomas F. Riley Terminal.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/historic-tram-of-buenos-aires",
    "description": "Transportation enthusiasts may be surprised to learn that Buenos Aires once had the highest tramway-to-population ratio in the world, earning it the nickname “City of Trams.” At its peak it had 875 kilometers (544 miles) of tramways, and 99 tram lines using 3,000 carriages. By 1963, however, the network began to be dismantled in favor of buses and the metro. One of the few remnants is this small, 2 kilometer loop in the Caballito neighborhood. A group called the Amigos del Tranvía (friends of the tramway) volunteers on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays to operate the trams along the loop on a first-come first-serve basis, completely free of charge. They also share some of the history of the tram system, their organization, and sell various souvenirs that support the organization. Riding the tram feels like you’re being transported back in time.",
