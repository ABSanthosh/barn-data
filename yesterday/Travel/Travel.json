    "description": "The capital’s Overground routes have been rebranded to reflect the distinct flavours of neighbourhoods they cross – as these station to station strolls revealIn a major rebrand, London’s six (previously all orange) Overground lines have been given new names and new colours to reflect the identity of the neighbourhoods they run through (and make the system easier to navigate). It’s also a way to celebrate the capital’s diverse communities and histories. For those wishing to explore further, I have walked six routes using stations on each line which take in dozens of landmarks with connections to the themes, from gardens and galleries to historic houses and monuments.

    "description": "From the wild wonders of a national park in Ireland to a perfect pastry in a Portuguese surfing town, our tipsters revel in surprises on their travelsSweet, soft, crispy, satisfyingly dense yet fluffy – we have found the perfect pastry. It’s all we think about when we wake up in delightful Ericeira, 30 miles north of Lisbon. We are here for the surf – Ericeira is in a world surfing reserve – but really the ouriço, a pastry unique to this town, is reason enough to visit. It translates as “hedgehog” but also “sea urchin” (Ouriço-do-mar) and sea urchin statues adorn the town. We enjoy the confusion – even our Portuguese friend seems unsure of the pastries’ origin. We get them at Casa da Fernanda. We say we’ll take them to the beach, it’s just a few steps down the road, but in fact we can’t wait and eat them right outside the cafe. We’ll be back for more.Fran Continue reading...",

Remains of the Roman aqueduct are encased in glass beside the fountain. The fountain's design features a traditional Andalusian style with ornate stonework, showcasing the intricate craftsmanship typical of the period. The fountain served as a communal gathering spot where locals would collect water and socialize, playing a central role in daily life. This historic fountain is a functional piece of urban infrastructure and an artistic and cultural treasure. The surrounding area is filled with narrow, winding streets, traditional whitewashed houses, and vibrant floral displays, offering a glimpse into the quintessential Andalusian way of life.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kashikobuchi-spider-stele",
    "description": "Through the city of Sendai runs the Hirose River. It has several stream pools along its course, one of which is known as Kashikobuchi, or the Wise Abyss, and there is a chilling legend that accounts for its name. Once upon a time, a local man was fishing by this stream pool when he found a gossamer thread tied around his ankle. Finding it strange, the man undid it and instead tied it around the trunk of a nearby willow tree. The same thing happened over and over again, until the tree got dragged into the water with a loud noise. Dumbfounded, the man stood there watching the ripples spread on the surface of the river. Out of the silence that followed, an ominous voice was heard saying \"Kashikoi, kashikoi \"(Very wise, very wise). Then the man finally saw what lurked underneath the water: a monstrous spider that reigned over the area, preying on unsuspecting villagers. Interestingly, the same spider makes an appearance in another folk tale of Sendai. In this legend, a large eel that lived in the downstream called on another villager to aid him in a fight with the spider, asking him to stand by as a witness and not to make a sound. The next evening, the villager came to see the eel and the spider fighting, and could not help but scream in terror. This caused the eel to lose the battle, and all the villager saw was its severed head glaring at him from the water, before losing his mind and dying. The Spider of Kashikobuchi was both feared and worshipped by the villagers, who regarded him as a god of trade and protector against floods. Today, a largely neglected stele in the thicket by National Route 48—overlooking the Kashikobuchi pool, no less—serves as the only testament to this spider god, here referred to as Myōhō-gumo-no-rei, or the Ghost of the Mystic Spider.",
