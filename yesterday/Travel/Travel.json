    "description": "Along a clean, modern street in Derbyshire, walking through the right door can take you back in time, and down a mine. At the Peak District Lead Mining Museum, visitors can explore models of mines and shafts to see how lead miners did their jobs in this town for generations. Across the street, take a tour of Temple Mine, a real 1920s fluorite mine. Lead ore, called galena, has been mined in the Peak District since Roman times. Mining supported the families of Derbyshire for generations up until the 20th century, when the industry dried up as new sources of ore weren't being found, and the low market price of lead and the rising operating costs made the mines unprofitable.  Today, the Peak District Lead Mining Museum is housed in the village of Matlock Bath's Grand Pavilion building. In addition to interactive mine models, the museum is home to the United Kingdom's only publicly accessible examples of water pressure engines. While steam engines were a popular method for pumping water out of mines, they required fuel. In Derbyshire, and a few other select places, miners chose to instead use the water pressure from streams hundreds of feet above. These pumping engines were massive. Since the mines closed in 1954, these engines were mostly left in place. The example in the museum was recovered by the Peak District Mines Historical Society, from a disused mine at Winster.",

    "description": "In the heritage precinct of Old Goa, there are several buildings from the Portuguese Era. At its peak, Old Goa was called \"Rome of the East.\" Today, the monuments of Old Goa are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A short distance west of Se Cathedral stands a church and the Convent of St. Francis of Assisi. It is said that eight Portuguese Franciscan friars arrived in Goa in 1517 and secured a few houses from the then-governor. Eventually, they converted the houses into a chapel with three altars and a choir. Later, the chapel was modified into a church in 1521 and consecrated in 1602. Later in 1661, the building was replaced by the current structure. The church has retained its earlier entrance as well as its original Portuguese Manueline architecture. The exterior is Tuscan, while the interior is Baroque with Corinthian features. During the 1830s, the Portuguese banned all religious orders in Old Goa, and the buildings slowly fell into disrepair. In 1964, the convent connected to the church was converted into a museum by the Archaeological Survey of India. The church’s interior is decorated with paintings and frescos, depicting the life and times of its patron saint Giovanni di Pietro di Bernardone, also known as St. Francis of Assisi, who founded the religious order of the Franciscans.",

    "description": "With no television or phone signal, we had no option but to disconnect from everyday life and appreciate the woods, rivers and fellsIf you want to reach Shank Wood log cabin, the key is to keep going: to the very top of England; deep into the woods; right to the edge of a river. As we drove through pockmarked fields, and down bumpy dirt tracks, steeling ourselves for a steep, muddy descent, I began to realise just how isolated our home for the next few days would be.The cabin, with its moss-covered roof and walls made from stacked sitka spruce logs, could have been lifted straight from the pages of a children’s book. Perched above the River Lyne, in Shank Wood ancient woodlands in the very north of Cumbria, it lived up to its billing on the website as “the real secluded log cabin experience”.
