    "description": "From art deco lidos to 1980s Speedos, the curator of a new exhibition on swimming and style talks about the inspiration behind it‘The first thing to say is that I’m a terrible swimmer,” says Amber Butchart, curator of a new exhibition on swimming that opens at the Design Museum in London this week. Growing up, school swimming lessons were “horrible, traumatic” – the cold water, the humiliation, the scrutiny from teenage boys. But something shifted when she moved to Margate 10 years ago and discovered the joy of swimming in the resort’s huge tidal pool, which was built in the 1930s. “This sounds quite pretentious, but it’s this idea of becoming one with the horizon,” says Butchart. “It’s almost like an existential feeling of the vastness of the world and being physically a part of that when you’re immersed in water. It’s transformational.”Splash! A Century of Swimming and Style explores our enduring love affair with swimming, from Britain’s lido boom of the 1920s and 30s to the Mermaidcore trend which has been all over TikTok in recent years. Among the 200 exhibits are the first Olympic solo swimming gold medal won by a British woman, a selection of men’s Speedos from the 1980s and the iconic red swimsuit worn by Pamela Anderson in Baywatch. Though the exhibition tells the story of swimming through the lens of design and fashion, Butchart was keen to avoid the kitschy stereotypes of “bathing beauties” that often accompany the theme, and to take a deeper dive into the politics of the swimming pool.“It’s transformational.” Amber Butchart photographed at the Walpole Bay Tidal Pool in Margate.

    "description": "A path in the Madonie natural park once used by itinerant friars takes present-day hikers on mountain trails through a terrain rich in wildlifeDespite walking for three days, we’ve seen no one. Not a single hiker, dog walker or shepherd. Instead, golden eagles have circled lazily overhead, stags have boldly held our gaze, and rare blue butterflies have flitted around our booted feet. The silence here is deep and dense, broken only by birdsong.This is the Madonie national park, also known as the Sicilian Alps, home to many of the island’s highest mountains and rarest plants. It’s a landscape of 200 million-year-old rocks, rich in fossils. Of raptors and the tiniest of songbirds. Of wild boar, fallow deer and porcupines. Of cyclamen and crocuses. Of the largest holly trees on the planet, and of 65 varieties of orchid. A landscape that is void of tourists, ramblers and Sicilians. For anyone in search of wilderness, solitude and sunshine, I can’t think of a better place. Continue reading...",

    "description": "The pair of earthenware comal griddles fueled by smoldering oak coals at Tacos del Carmen are beautiful things, weathered by use and white from curing with lime powder. They impart a unique earthy smokiness to this street stand’s quesadillas, empanadas, and tacos. That primeval flavor of clay might be one reason why even in this city of endless street stands this one is always surrounded by crowds—including some of Oaxaca’s top chefs waiting their turn.  Open from 7 a.m. until early afternoon, this legendary taco stop is run like a tight ship by Margarita Martinez, whose mother started the business in 1974 and whose recipes Margarita still uses. Assisting her is a small brigade of white-aproned women, most of them family members. For starters, have an empanada de amarillo which entails a giant tortilla folded calzone-style over chicken, minty hoja santa (pepperleaf) and dabs of yellow mole powered with costeño and chilhuacle chiles.  The tacos here are also particular. The same giant tortillas, made that morning from freshly ground nixtamalized masa, are rolled around some half dozen different fillings and allowed to sit on comal for that slightly charred finish.  The most satisfying filling? A crumbly chorizo that’s warmed over coals under the comal. Another must? A taco de chile relleno folded around pork-filled chiles de aqua along with melty quesillo cheese.",

    "description": "Since early history spring water was considered to have healing properties, with many locations in Scotland becoming famous for their healing or holy wells. Brow Well is a chalybeate spring that flows with naturally iron-salt-rich water. This water was believed to cure a whole host of illnesses. During the 17th century it became fashionable to visit spas with mineral springs in the pursuit of health and beauty. When Scottish poet Robert Burns’ health began to decline in 1796, he visited Brow Well to take its waters and sea bathe nearby. He actually died soon after, but the well became a place for enthusiasts of his poetry to come and contemplate his works. An annual commemoration takes place here each July. The well now has lines from his poetry running around the edge of the pool.",
