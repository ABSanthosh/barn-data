    "description": "A prototype electric snowmobile and old-school wooden skis open up Sweden’s backcountry as our writer goes on the hunt for local wildlifeOn the slopes up to the ridge, the snow is deep and fresh. Long frozen arms of it hug the trees. Behind us the tracks of our skis gleam with a strange blue light, and in front, delicately drawn into the snow, is the perfect feathery imprint of a bird – like a pale icy fossil. My guide, Jens Sarlin, from Next Step Nature, stops. “Capercaillie,” he says. “It was feeding on pine needles up top and has landed here, then dug a burrow in the snow. It may still be there.”We edge forwards. A trail of bird footprints lead to a hole, but it’s empty except for some droppings. “They dig down and then sideways to fool the foxes,” says Jens. We move forwards again, silent on our hunters’ skis, antique wooden heirlooms that slip easily over deep soft snow. What we are hunting, with cameras only, is something rarely seen – the wolverine – and Jens knows the best places to find them. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/who-was-billy-the-hippo",
    "description": "Ever since she was born at Thailand’s Khao Kheow Open Zoo in July 2024, Moo Deng, the pygmy hippopotamus, has captured public imagination, with visitors to her home quadrupling since her birth. She has also raised the profile of her species, the lesser-known—and more endangered—sheep-sized cousin of the common hippo. But Moo Deng was not the first mini hippo to become a major celebrity. “Baby Hippo for Coolidge is Coming From Liberia,” the New York Times announced in May 1927. U.S. President Calvin Coolidge and his wife, Grace, were avowed animal lovers who filled the White House with cats, birds, and dogs, among other species. Earlier in 1927, the Coolidges had made the difficult decision to send their raccoon, Rebecca—once rescued from the Thanksgiving table—to live at a zoo. After Rebecca’s departure, the White House began to receive even more exotic animals as gifts from supporters. Many of these wound up at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., anyway, although the Coolidges continued to visit and fund the upkeep of the critters they sent there. “President Coolidge has presented the National Zoo with more animals, sent to him by his admirers, than have any of his predecessors—Roosevelt alone excepted,” the New York Times wrote later in 1927. So it was not out of the ordinary when Harvey S. Firestone, founder of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, announced that he was sending “Billy,” a live pygmy hippopotamus captured in West Africa, to the White House. Sources differ as to when it was decided that “Billy” was short for “William Johnson Hippopotamus,” but the name stuck. Whatever fondness the Coolidges had toward animals, there was nothing sentimental about the circumstances of Billy’s journey. Half-grown at 300 pounds, the hippo was captured after his rainforest home was destroyed by the encroachment of Firestone’s rubber plantations. Habitat loss is still the greatest threat facing wild pygmy hippos, said to number as few as 2,000 today. By coincidence, Billy arrived in Washington, D.C., on the same day as aviator Charles Lindbergh after his own transatlantic voyage. But once Coolidge was done awarding a medal to Lindbergh, he turned his attention to Billy, setting up a home for him at the National Zoo. As only the eighth pygmy hippo ever brought to the United States, Billy was an especial curiosity and quickly drew crowds. The pygmy hippo had been known to Westerners only since the mid-19th century and was rarely observed in the wild due to its shy, nocturnal habits, meaning that Billy’s first caretakers knew little about his species. Despite this, Billy adjusted well to captivity, and was described in the New York Times as playing with his keeper, “frisky as a dog. Even the antics of the monkeys go unobserved when the keeper opens the tiny hippo's cage and cuts up with him.” Because of Billy’s good health and popularity, the zoo decided to acquire a mate for him in 1929. “Prior to this, the model for many zoos was to exhibit a single specimen of an animal until it died and then replace it with another,” Marguerite Roby, a Smithsonian photograph archivist, wrote in a profile of Billy in 2012. “This foray into hippo husbandry launched a new era of zoological parks as environments for the study of wildlife and animal conservation.” However, zookeepers still had a lot to learn. Billy and his first mate, Hannah, were initially housed with lions. This is now believed to have stressed the hippos and played a role in the early deaths of their first three offspring. Media reports at the time often blamed Hannah for these deaths. In 1931, the Washington Post described the first calf as “ignored” and “neglected” by Hannah. After the death of the third calf, William Mann, the National Zoo director, told the paper that Hannah was “just a bad mother.” Thanks to improvements to her enclosure, including separating the hippos from the lions, Hannah was noticeably more at ease during her fourth pregnancy in 1938. The resulting healthy calf was named Gumdrop, supposedly suggested by a child visiting the zoo. All of Billy’s subsequent progeny would be known as “Gumdrop,” followed by a Roman numeral indicating their birth order. By 1939, Billy and his growing family were so popular that they were transported to Queens, New York, for the World’s Fair and displayed at the Firestone pavilion. Billy, Hannah, and the Gumdrops continued to make media appearances in the 1940s and ’50s, including a 1952 photoshoot for Life magazine featuring Gumdrop XII following his mother and being toweled off after a bath. The National Zoo sold or traded most of Billy’s offspring to other zoos once they reached maturity. Billy became so successful—and lucrative—as a “stud” for breeding that the zoo introduced a second mate for him, Matilda, in 1940. This prompted perhaps the greatest headline of Billy’s lifetime, from the Washington Post: “Pygmy Hippo to Become Polygamist.” Only a few of the 23 calves fathered by Billy were male. A high ratio of females to males is still observed in captive-born pygmy hippos, for reasons unknown to scientists. Billy died in 1955 at around 30 years old, on the low end of a captive pygmy hippo’s lifespan today. The last Gumdrop was born to Hannah five months later. In a birth announcement in the Washington Post, a zookeeper said that Billy had “carried his work on to the end” by siring so many offspring. Today, most captive pygmy hippos in the United States are descended from Billy. According to the International Studbook for the Pygmy Hippopotamus, there are now more than 1,600 pygmy hippos in zoos worldwide—almost as many as are believed to exist in the wild. While the animals are more popular and numerous in captivity than ever, their survival in nature is far less certain. Wild pygmy hippos have “nowhere else they can go” amid shrinking habitats, hippo specialist Gabriella Flacke told the BBC in 2024. Because the creatures are so rare and challenging to observe in nature, captive populations play a major role in their conservation and study. The story of Billy’s rise to fame is a reminder that our desire to see wild animals up close is nothing new, but also of how far we have come in understanding them.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/trompettersteeg",
    "description": "Central Amsterdam and its main Red Light District (also known as De Wallen) are known for their narrow pedestrianized walkways and alleyways. Trompettersteeg (which translates into English as “Trumpeter Street”) is by far the narrowest of these walkways. Located just south of the Oude Kerk, the street is only one meter wide near the end where it reaches the canal. Hence, this street is widely heralded as the narrowest street in Amsterdam. While Trompettersteeg’s narrowness is a novelty that may have attracted some visitors to the area, the street’s location within Amsterdam’s Red Light District meant that it had in the past attracted many more people who wanted to see the prostitutes in the area, especially since the street was lined with the windows where the prostitutes worked. Tourists walking down the street could become literally jammed inside the narrowest part of the passageway. However, as part of the city of Amsterdam’s work to reform the Red Light District, all of the windows on Trompettersteeg as well most of the windows on the nearby streets have now ceased to function as places to find sex workers, and have been converted into commercial spaces for small businesses. The street is now much quieter and only attracts people looking for new businesses, people looking for the Red Light District using out-of-date travel information, or people looking for the alleyway itself. Notably, the narrowest part of Trompettersteeg near the canal is coated with ever-changing graffiti. Sometimes the passage contains well-planned and rather elaborate street art. For example, in 2021, street artists Dopie and Ultimo.11 painted a three-dimensional version of Amsterdam’s coat of arms within the passageway. Other times, however, Trompettersteeg’s eastern end is covered mainly in hastily-drawn tags.",
