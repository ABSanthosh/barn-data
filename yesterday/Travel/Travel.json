    "description": "What happens when you take a screen-addicted family of six on a canal boat with a patchy phone signal? Our writer embarks on a floating digital detoxI’m on the towpath of the Kennet and Avon canal, a loaf of freshly baked sourdough bread in one hand and a bag of pungently oozing local cheese in the other. As I turn the corner near Trowbridge in Wiltshire, I brace myself. Ahead is our hired-for-the-week narrowboat, and I’m fully expecting to find my four gen Z children (aged 18 to 24) and my doomscrolling husband either bickering or welded to their screens. To my surprise, they are all reading books.We’ve stopped taking family holidays in exotic, or even Mediterranean, locations. Too hot. Too busy. Too flight-shaming. But when I announced this year’s jaunt – a week on the mid-section of the Reading-to-Bristol canal – eyes rolled in horror. As the departure date loomed, I panicked. How would we survive in such a minuscule space? What if the lack of activities drove us to spend even longer on our phones? Continue reading...",

    "description": "It took a few adjustments on both sides – she wasn’t keen on snails or Rembrandt – but after seeing Paris, Berlin and Venice, she wants to go again next yearA year ago, I discovered a bit of a travel hack – that if accompanied by an adult (obviously) children under the age of 12 can explore Europe by train for absolutely zilch. Profoundly susceptible to any sort of bargain, even those that promise a net deficit in the long run, I determined to take advantage of Interrail’s generous offer, despite lacking dependents of the specified vintage.Sourcing someone under 12 was far easier than I’d imagined. When I lodged an enquiry about my 10-year-old niece, asking if Annabelle might be available for an Interrailing stint at Easter, my brother couldn’t sign her up fast enough. (Though he did insist on some caveats: in bed by 10pm, out of bed by 9am, and no watching sweary Gordon Ramsay shows). Continue reading...",

    "description": "Once off-limits to the public, this desert facility near Marana, Arizona now offers guided tours arranged through the airport. It used to be marked by a guardhouse with a ”Use of Deadly Force Authorized” sign; today, visitors can drive right up to the fence, and with a little planning, they can even explore the airpark’s contents up close. The site stores commercial aircraft for airlines and clients around the world, with an incredible range that is always changing. Additionally, several companies on the property paint, repair, and salvage aircraft. One section of the airpark holds very old aircraft, including a few 747s from airlines like TWA and, until recently, Pan Am. For those who schedule a tour, the experience can include a look inside a small building with photographs and memorabilia, as well as a drive around the facility with exceptional commentary.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hachiman-bridge",
    "description": "In November 1878, a new bridge was built over the Kaede River in Kyobashi Ward, based on the designs by American civil engineer Squire Whipple. Made mainly of iron (not steel, that is), it was the first Japanese bridge of its kind, and seen as an icon of westernization. Named Danjo Bridge after the nearby mansion of samurai lord Shimada Danjo, the bowstring truss bridge served as a significant point between the Imperial Palace, Honjo and Fukagawa areas. In 1912, a new Danjo Bridge replaced it and set it aside, and it went into disuse following the great Kanto earthquake of 1923. In May 1929, the old Danjo Bridge was relocated to the Fukagawa area, not far from the popular Tomioka Hachiman-gū shrine. It once crossed the Hachiman-bori canal, but it was later landfilled and turned into a pedestrian path. The bridge was also renamed Hachiman Bridge and preserved as a modest monument.",
