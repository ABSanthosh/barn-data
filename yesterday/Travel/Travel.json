If the pub’s 17th-century walls could talk they would recount tales of smugglers and pirates and heroic lifeboat rescues. These days you might overhear surfers regaling each other with stories of heroic waves ridden on the reef. The fire keeps burning and the ale keeps flowing regardless.Layla Astley Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tuas-lamp-post-1-singapore",
    "description": "In Tuas, on the westernmost edge of Singapore, a lamp post has become an unexpected monument, a source of joy for cyclists, and a rare exception in a country with strict laws against vandalism. The story of what makes this lamp post special started in 2014, when a group of cyclists pasted a sticker reading \"Pedal Until Shiok\" on the post, marking the end of a 50-kilometer bike ride. (Shiok is a Singaporean and Malaysian word used to convey excitement and happiness.) According to Singapore's Vandalism Act of 1966, pasting that sticker was an illegal act. It was soon removed by authorities. A while later, other cyclists started flocking to the lamp post to take pictures and paste their own stickers. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and then during the so-called \"circuit breaker\" period from April to June, cycling gained popularity among many Singaporeans, and even more people were leaving their mark on Tuas Lamp Post 1. Although most citizens know of Singapore’s vandalism laws, cyclists expressed their unhappiness when the stickers were removed from the lamp post. The government took notice of their concerns, and in January 2021, Singapore's transport minister Ong Ye Kung announced that the stickers could stay. Kung acknowledged the unique appeal of the lamp post, and its importance to local cyclists. He expressed, \"These are little exceptions to the rule, which do not cause disamenities or pose safety hazards to the public, to brighten up life in Singapore.\"",

    "description": "Thonsepar, aka St. Mary's Islands, aka Coconut Island, sits in the Arabian Sea just off the coast of Karnataka state of India. The island is known for its distinctive geological formations, specifically the columnar joints (hexagon-shaped interlocking columns) that protrude from the earth. The columnar joints vary in height, but the tallest of them measures approximately six meters (20 feet). According to geologists, the columns formed by subvolcanic activity roughly 60 million years ago as Madagascar split off from India. The shape of these joints is the product of a physical process that can happen as melted lava rock solidifies. As a large amount of molten material cools, it starts to contract, creating cracks in the newly solid surface. The cracks extend down as the rock below the surface continues to cool, resulting in these unique rock formations. You can see similar formations at the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. Thonsepar was classified as a National Geological Monument in 2001 by the Geological Survey of India.",
