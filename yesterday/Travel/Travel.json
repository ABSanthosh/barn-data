    "description": "The Eternal City’s monuments and museums are busy at the best of times, but there remain myriad treasures to explore that are well off the beaten track One of the earliest European printed books was a tourist guide to Rome. Ranging from information on ancient ruins, fallen temples and classical bathhouses to the place where an emperor “saw a vision in the sky”, Mirabilia Urbis Romae (Marvels of the City of Rome) was written in Latin in the early 12th century. The popular text was reproduced in dozens of manuscripts and was printed and published in the mid-1470s, a mere two decades after the Gutenberg Bible. As with many a menu in modern-day Rome, English, French, German and Italian versions were available.Later, the Grand Tour brought throngs to the Eternal City of monuments and museums. Beguiled by its beauty, its mixture of terracotta and mocha colours, the galleries of renaissance sculpture and dark chapels full of old masters, many thought it a heaven on Earth. Dickens had mixed feelings. Recollecting the Piazza di Spagna, where artists’ models gathered in public to be hired, he wrote: “They started up before me, in Rome, in the broad day, like so many saddled and bridled nightmares.” Continue reading...",

I was new to Yemen and had no idea what to expect. All I could see was that we were on a stony mountain plateau rushing towards a cliff edge in a Toyota pickup truck that no one had remembered to service and MOT.The twin parallel tyre marks on the dusty mountain top took a sharp left and the horizon fell away into a hazy, bluish void.

    "description": "Digital screenings may be the mainstream today, but there do remain cinephiles’ oases for films in 16mm and 35mm. Planet Plus One in Osaka is quite possibly one of the best of such places. Founded in June 1974 as the Planet Film Library, what is today the Kobe Planet Film Archive has collected many 16mm and 35mm films from university libraries across the country and beyond, saving them from being thrown away. It regularly held screenings to keep them in use, and eventually opened its own cinema, Planet Plus One (also stylized as PLANET+1), in the Nakazakichō neighborhood of Osaka in 1995. Snuck away on the second floor of an ordinary building, the “minitheater”-style cinema is sure to charm you the second you open the door and climb the steep, narrow staircase. On the walls are posters of classic Hollywood films, from The Philadelphia Story (1940) to The Sugarland Express (1974), promising excellent taste. The screen is rather small, and there are only 25 seats’ worth of squeaky wooden chairs with cushions on them, but the speakeasy feel and the big speakers suggest a good time for cinephiles. Visible at the back of the room is the film projector, completing the old-fashioned cinema vibe. Planet Plus One’s own tagline is “Every day is a film festival”; and sure enough, it often shows niche and obscure movies—just one or two per day—even going as far back as the Silent Era, for which it hires an organist to provide music. Whether it’s a John Ford, Corman or Truffaut, seeing a movie at the Planet is its own experience, something that might get you hooked.",

    "title": "Hardscrabble, Delaware in Seaford, Delaware",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hardscrabble-delaware",
    "description": "Who knew etymology could be so violent? In a parking lot in rural Sussex County, Delaware, a sign can be found that makes an unusual claim: “The term \"Hardscrabble\" was created during the 1700s when two men of Irish extraction engaged in a rough fight where Sussex 473 and 446 cross. The skirmish ended in a stalemate.” Is this story true? Did the phrase used by Herman Melville, Lewis and Clark, and countless reporters illustrating someone’s rough background originate from a fight between two Irish Americans fighting in a nearby Delaware intersection? It’s hard to say. But also, no, it’s unlikely. So what’s the deal? In the sign’s defense, the exact origins of the phrase “hardscrabble” are unknown, and it is indeed an Americanism that arose during the late 18th century near Delaware, so it can’t be ruled out entirely. But the first uses of the phrase, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, suggest showing an effort in vigorous circumstances, or a different type of struggle than the one caused by rowdy Irishmen.  But the most common early use of the phrase referred to land that was rocky or difficult to farm. Several American towns across the country were and are named Hardscrabble. Ironically, Hardscrabble, Delaware is technically not among them. The Delaware General Assembly renamed the town of Hardscrabble to Jasper in 1863. However, they may have lacked the pugilistic instincts to make the name change stick. This led to the latest and current definition of the word, which is an adjective that generally describes people who come from remote or impoverished circumstances. But the historical sign makes a second and even bolder claim: “The Hardscrabble tradition would continue as boys would compete to put each other in the store's flour barrell [sic] on Saturday nights.” Unpacking this fighting claim perhaps helps shine a light on how this sign came to be. The store the sign refers to is one that was built by a man named Garrison Messick. The Messicks were and are a notable Sussex County family, with roads, a tractor company, and an agricultural museum named for different members. In fact, the intersection mentioned on the sign is now known as Messick Road (and Beaver Dam Branch Road). The names mentioned on the sign are of real people, even if the unusual traditions are unverified.  The likely answer to this specific family history is found in the former owners of the site, which was a general store named Messick Supply. The store was a gas station, gun dealership, plumbing supply store, and even sold turkey sandwiches, and the historical sign may have added to the store’s provenance and helped retell a family legend. While the store is no longer in existence, Irish Americans and others can still head to Hardscrabble, Delaware to engage in a centuries-old tradition of fisticuffs.",
