    "description": "Treks and tearooms, scones and safaris … It’s hard to beat this corner of England in the springExmoor’s 37-mile stretch of coastline is one of the most undeveloped in England, with steep cliffs (at 1,044ft Great Hangman is the highest sea cliff in England) overlooking quiet fishing villages and long sweeps of beach. Broadsands – not to be confused with the beach of the same name in south Devon – is a hidden gem, lying 239 steps down from the South West Coast Path, between Watermouth and Combe Martin. It’s also accessible by kayak from Combe Martin, but for those who do walk, the lovely outdoor terrace at the nearby Sawmills Freehouse is the perfect recovery spot after the climb back up.sawmillsfreehouse.co.uk Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fontana-della-terrina",
    "description": "In Rome's Piazza Chiesa Nuova, near the Chiesa di Santa Maria in Vallicella, sits an unassuming fountain with an unexpected past. The Fontana della Terrina was sculpted by Giacomo della Porta, a student of Michelangelo and a man whose resume would be the envy of most renaissance artists of the era. His talents extended beyond masonry—he was entrusted with the technical execution of several domes and fountains throughout Rome, including completing the dome of St. Peter’s Basilica after Michelangelo’s death. But if Porta were to stroll through Rome today, not only would he fail to recognize his own fountain—he probably wouldn’t even find it. Originally, the Fontana della Terrina stood proudly in the bustling Campo de' Fiori marketplace, where it had an open, airy design and no lid to speak of. It was fed by the Acqua Vergine aqueduct, and water gently bubbled over four bronze dolphins, which were originally intended for the Turtle Fountain (Fontana delle Tartarughe) in nearby Piazza Mattei. Unfortunately, what started as an elegant public water feature quickly devolved into a soggy health hazard. Vendors at the market used it to wash fruits, vegetables, and meat, while animals drank from it and passersby found... other creative ways to pollute it. Within 50 years, the once-charming fountain had become less of a picturesque landmark and more of a medieval petri dish. Pope Gregory XV was bothered by the grimy mess and decided Rome deserved better. He ordered a cover for the fountain—transforming it into a giant stone soup tureen. Who actually designed the lid remains a mystery and the dolphins were removed and vanished. In 1889, the fountain was removed by the city to install a bronze statue of Giordano Bruno, the philosopher and scientist who was burned alive in Campo di Fiori in 1600 after being declared a heretic by the Pope Clemente VIII. The statue remains there today, standing as a solemn reminder of the importance of free thought—while the fountain itself was unceremoniously shuffled off to storage, where it gathered dust for decades. In 1924, city workers stumbled upon the forgotten tureen in storage and put it in its current location, slightly sunken below street level near a city bus stop. These days, most people pass by the fountain without giving it a second glance. But if they do stop to look, they’ll find the faded remnants of a single inscription around the top left by the mysterious lid-maker: \"Love God and do not fail, do good and let it be said. MDCXXII.\"",

    "description": "The lesser-known historical site of Deir el-Medina. or Valley of the Artisans, in Egypt is a gateway beyond the high tombs, royal palaces, temples, and ancient homes of the elite. In ancient times, this village was home to skilled workers, primarily the painters and sculptors responsible for the tombs in the Valley of the Kings and Valley of the Queens. These people gave their lives to the very writing intended to converse with the Gods, meticulously designed to keep maat (an ancient Egyptian concept meaning order and harmony). Outside these tombs isfet (chaos) reigned.  In ancient Egypt, only a small percentage of the population could read or write. Literacy was a privilege of the scribes, who were trained in hieroglyphs and hieratic. Due to the special requirements of the tombs, Deir el-Medina had an unusually high concentration of literate people, sending and reading messages to one another. Residents shared their ideas, told mythological stories and diarized their thoughts and worries, all here in Egypt's 3,500-year-old writing club. Here you will find houses as well as the tombs of high-ranking scribes and artisans. In one tomb you will find, painted onto the wall, a prostrate man, praying at the foot of a palm tree, dates falling like the burnt dough of Renenutet. The prayer is a humble one, not for glory, power, or ego, but for drinking water. Surrounding the figure, his words—depicted in hieroglyphs—float around him, spreading outward, in a request to the ancient Egyptian gods. There are three painted tombs in total, and a vast area of mud-brick homes to explore. This includes a temple dedicated to the goddess Hathor. The site provides a unique insight into the daily lives of ancient Egyptians, including their religious practices, family and work routines. Excavations have revealed thousands of artifacts including love letters, literature, and joke.",
