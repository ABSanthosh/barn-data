    "description": "Santa is coming and these pubs are going to town with their tinsel and fairy lights, as well as hosting special drinks and events over the festive seasonIt’s hard to imagine a list of Christmassy pubs without the maximalist Churchill in Kensington. Its outside is usually covered in flowers, while inside, where Thai food and pints of London Pride are served, the ceiling and walls are hung with a strange collection of artefacts: lanterns, butterflies, 100 assorted chamber pots, second world war memorabilia and pictures of Winston Churchill, whose grandparents were regulars. In winter there are extra decorations (fake greenery, presents, north pole signs), and the exterior swaps the pansies and petunias for dozens of fir trees and thousands of lights. There’s a post box by the door, reindeer near the roof and a giant Ho Ho Ho in lights over the window. Continue reading...",

    "description": "I took the scenic route to Daugavpils, birthplace of the abstract artist – a world of breathtaking colour, kindness and coldIt’s a funny time of year to be visiting Latvia’s second city, Daugavpils, in the far south-east of the country. It’s midwinter and an icy blast has swept across northern Europe, bringing with it some of the coldest temperatures Latvia has experienced in a decade. On my third and final night, I set a new personal best, or worst, of -30C, and all that matters now is survival.Daugavpils is one of the most ethnically Russian cities inside the European Union today, a fifth of the population being Latvian, while half are ethnic Russians. During the Soviet occupation, Moscow sent tens of thousands of Russians to live in Latvia, as well as to other parts of the Soviet Union. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tuas-lamp-post-1-singapore",
    "description": "In Tuas, on the westernmost edge of Singapore, a lamp post has become an unexpected monument, a source of joy for cyclists, and a rare exception in a country with strict laws against vandalism. The story of what makes this lamp post special started in 2014, when a group of cyclists pasted a sticker reading \"Pedal Until Shiok\" on the post, marking the end of a 50-kilometer bike ride. (Shiok is a Singaporean and Malaysian word used to convey excitement and happiness.) According to Singapore's Vandalism Act of 1966, pasting that sticker was an illegal act. It was soon removed by authorities. A while later, other cyclists started flocking to the lamp post to take pictures and paste their own stickers. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and then during the so-called \"circuit breaker\" period from April to June, cycling gained popularity among many Singaporeans, and even more people were leaving their mark on Tuas Lamp Post 1. Although most citizens know of Singapore’s vandalism laws, cyclists expressed their unhappiness when the stickers were removed from the lamp post. The government took notice of their concerns, and in January 2021, Singapore's transport minister Ong Ye Kung announced that the stickers could stay. Kung acknowledged the unique appeal of the lamp post, and its importance to local cyclists. He expressed, \"These are little exceptions to the rule, which do not cause disamenities or pose safety hazards to the public, to brighten up life in Singapore.\"",

    "description": "Thonsepar, aka St. Mary's Islands, aka Coconut Island, sits in the Arabian Sea just off the coast of Karnataka state of India. The island is known for its distinctive geological formations, specifically the columnar joints (hexagon-shaped interlocking columns) that protrude from the earth. The columnar joints vary in height, but the tallest of them measures approximately six meters (20 feet). According to geologists, the columns formed by subvolcanic activity roughly 60 million years ago as Madagascar split off from India. The shape of these joints is the product of a physical process that can happen as melted lava rock solidifies. As a large amount of molten material cools, it starts to contract, creating cracks in the newly solid surface. The cracks extend down as the rock below the surface continues to cool, resulting in these unique rock formations. You can see similar formations at the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. Thonsepar was classified as a National Geological Monument in 2001 by the Geological Survey of India.",
