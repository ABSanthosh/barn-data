    "description": "The north of England’s most overlooked natural beauty spot is home to wild terrain and some of the UK’s rarest birds, including the spectacular hen harrierA grey male drifts slowly across the moorland. No, not me, but a big, beautiful hen harrier, scouting for love, or breakfast. I’ve only been here 10 minutes, and I’m in a mild state of shock. Aren’t these precious, threatened birds of prey so vanishingly rare that seeing one is hugely improbable?I’m walking with Sonja Ludwig, RSPB species and habitats officer for the Forest of Bowland, and she knows these harriers. “They’re ‘traditional’ birds,” she says. “They tend to come back to more or less the same place. We always see them here. Rookies always notice the males first. Their plumage, white rump and the black tips on the wings are unmistakable.” Continue reading...",

    "description": "The challenging 870-mile trail cuts diagonally across Romania and takes in mountain meadows, fairytale forests and medieval monasteriesIt was about seven minutes into my cycle ride that the first signs of addiction became apparent. My ebike’s “power assist” button felt more like a morphine clicker as we climbed the misty hills of Bucovina in northern Romania. Sergiu, my group’s guide, knew what I was up to. “Be honest with yourself – only use ‘turbo’ if you have to!” he shouted. My thumb cowered under the handlebar.On previous adventures I’ve resisted assistance, maintaining that battery power is the preserve of the unserious. Nowadays, though, my pins aren’t as powerful, and on these vertiginous hills the extra oomph was near essential. But as with all drugs, moderation is key. After all, one wouldn’t want to run out of juice on hills that are home to wolves, bears and lynx. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/baatara-gorge-waterfall",
    "description": "Every spring and summer, a Jurassic limestone cave in the Mount Lebanon range turns into a 800-foot waterfall. The Baatara Gorge Waterfall drops through the Three Bridges Chasm. At the bottom, the water falls into a cave system and reemerges in the Dalleh Spring nearly four miles away. The hole and cave were formed by the rock's Upper Jurassic limestone reacting with weak acids naturally occurring in rainwater, causing erosion. Freezing winter temperatures also caused the rocks on chasm's walls to break off, widening the hole. Two natural bridges overlook the waterfall, as well as one at the ground level, giving the chasm its name. Despite its astonishing beauty, the Baatara Gorge Waterfall is little-known internationally. It was not known outside Lebanon until French speleologist Henri Coiffait visited the site in 1952. The hole's location was added to maps starting in the 1980s.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ugur-mumcu-park",
    "description": "Just off of Atatürk Boulevard, one of the city of Eskişehir's main thoroughfares, lies a tidy park dedicated to Uğur Mumcu, an investigative journalist who was killed in a car bombing outside his Ankara home in 1993. The wreckage of that car, raised on a marble pedestal and preserved under glass, serves as the park's centerpiece. The pedestal features a quote from Mumcu urging us not to forget victims of political violence. It comes from his 1975 poem \"Sesleniş,\" which honors the sacrifices of Turkish leftist youth.  Mumcu's murder remains unsolved, although many groups have been blamed or implicated, including MİT (Turkish Intelligence), the CIA, Mossad, and Iran. After the incident, the car remained in the custody of the police for 20 years, following which it was released to the victim's family. With their permission, and with the backing of the municipality and a local group of journalists, it made the 124-mile (200 km) journey to Eskişehir and was first displayed in the park in 2016. At the park's front entrance, a massive two-sided mosaic/photo collage depicts the journalist's face surrounded by newspaper headlines reacting to his death. At the other end sits a restaurant which offers a somber view of the memorial from a glass-enclosed patio.",
