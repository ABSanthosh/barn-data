It is renowned for prosecco, spritz and an original selection of cichetti nibbles created by owner Alessandra De Respinis, a big inspiration for the late Russell Norman’s Polpo in London. But the faithful local clientele at Al Bottegon, as the bar is known, come because it is one of Venice’s few specialist wine cellars, as Alessandra’s sons, Tommaso and Paolo, have amassed an unparalleled selection from vineyards in the surrounding Veneto and Friuli regions, alongside rare vintages from across Italy. It is also the place to come if you are looking to take home a bottle of quality grappa.Fondamenta Nani, 992 Continue reading...",

    "description": "The carbon footprint of a skiing holiday can be as deep as a crevasse, but one Austrian resort with sustainability at its heart is mitigating its impactThe view takes me aback. Not the panorama of 80 snow-capped, jagged peaks that top 3,000 metres, nor the lone skier carving perfect turns down a forest-fringed piste. They are lovely, of course, but the important view, the one that few winter sports enthusiasts will ever get to see, is behind a nondescript door next to the bakery that’s tucked beside the ski lift station in the bottom of this valley. In here may lie the answer to the question that brought me to Austria’s SkiWelt region: is it possible to ski green?I’ve always been a sceptic on that front. Skiing feels like the greatest possible waste of earthly resources for the benefit of a privileged few. From its consumer-porn stores filled with the latest in space-age clothing to its ugly clanking lifts, overheated hotels and casual use of helicopters, the entire industry is one giant middle finger to a burning planet, isn’t it?

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/kjeldsens-danish-cookies-hong-kong",
    "description": "This Lunar New Year in Hong Kong the likes of wu ha (taro fritter balls), yau gok (fried sweet dumplings), and roasted melon seed will sit upon tables at family gatherings, nourishing guests as they outwit their siblings at the mahjong table or reconnect with a distant cousin they haven’t seen in ages. Yet the title of the ultimate seasonal snack goes to an improbable candidate: cookies made in Denmark by the nearly century-old brand Kjeldsens. Few Hongkongers have a clue about how the brand name is pronounced—they're locally called “blue tin cookies” after the emblematic container—nor does the tin's navy shade complement the red palette dominating Lunar New Year celebrations. All the same, myriad cookie box sets are stacked like fortresses at supermarkets before finding their way into virtually every household. People debate over whether the ring-shaped pastry is superior to its pretzel-like, sugar-adorned counterpart, and vice versa. Even the tins are turned into objects of sentimental value, kept for storing trinkets. “It’s like an old childhood friend you never noticed, but oddly miss when you live thousands miles away from home,” says Calif Chong, a born-and-raised Hongkonger who now lives in London. “The cookies are delicious, but the best part is the tin! My mom has put needles, patches, and buttons she uses for sewing inside since I was in primary school.” According to Kjeldsens, we have Roger Lobo, a Hong Kong businessman, to thank for this remarkable episode of cultural exchange. In 1963, Lobo obtained a product catalog from a Danish trade executive and found himself drawn to a small ad for “cookies like grandmothers used to bake them.” He ordered a sample from Kjeldsens, only for the cookies to arrive in crumbles in a cardboard box. Lobo then asked for a second shipment to be packed in a tin container. Little did he know his request gave birth to an enduring food symbol. When they first arrived in Hong Kong, Kjeldsens' cookies were enjoyed by small, affluent circles. “Snacking wasn’t popular in the ’50s and ’60s, when much of the population was more concerned about staying afloat,” says Ka Chun Lui, a longtime Hong Kong food writer and the founder of Word by Word Collective, a publisher and bookstore specializing in food culture. That all changed with Hong Kong’s economic boom of the 1970s. “Living standards grew rapidly since then, and people started looking for something to munch on in between meals,” Lui says.“This led to the emergence of Chinese-style pastries, followed quickly by Western snacks.” With the middle classes able to afford the imported treats, Kjeldsens kicked local marketing into high gear, especially when it came to promoting their product for Lunar New Year and other holiday celebrations. The hook? That signature tin: A prestigious gift that helped buyers assert their social status among their peers on big occasions. “Substance determined how a gift was received back then. Filling butter biscuits, for instance, were preferred to candies,” Lui says. “But form carried just as much weight. The sheer size of the container was enough to make its presentation a spectacle. Its glossy surface and elaborate graphics turned the theatrics up another notch.” Since 1977, the company has churned out local commercials almost every year emphasizing the value of gifting a Kjeldsens cookie tin. The early ads of the '70s and '80s featured children at family gatherings, sometimes showing off their Western musical chops to boot, passing the baked delights to a group of beaming relatives. Catchy jingles hammered the message home. Lyrics such as “it’s poor manners to bring a bunch of bananas [a metaphor for empty hands] to visit families and friends” and “Danish blue tin cookies always impress” essentially laid out the dos and don’ts for Hongkongers if they were to score social points at important celebratory rituals. “In that era, there weren’t many platforms other than television for the public to access information, especially on imported goods, so people often took what they saw there at its word,” Lui adds. Kjeldsens still releases commercials tied to the Lunar New Year. And Hongkongers from each generation distinctively remember the commercials they grew up with (Chong specifically recalls a cute boy who donned a blue blazer in an early '00s ad). According to Kjeldsens, their message was clearly received: 86 percent of Hongkongers either purchase or consume their butter cookies around the Lunar New Year. This aligns with the United Nation’s trade data, which indicates exports in the “sweet biscuits” category from Denmark to Hong Kong skyrocket every October and November, as retail stores stock up the cookies just in time for the January shopping frenzy leading up to the big holiday. Success in Hong Kong inspired the brand to shift its focus from Denmark to the Asia-Pacific region. Currently, over 80 percent of Kjeldsens’ output is shipped abroad. You might register a few confused looks when handing out the brand's buttery treats around Nyhavn, but thousands of miles eastward, a “blue tin cookie” can earn you an auspicious red packet from an auntie as the Year of Snake rolls around.",

    "description": "The famous alleyways of Shinjuku’s Golden Gai are filled with tiny bars packed together. Head a little off the main strip and you’ll find a closet-sized red hued room filled with clamshell VHS tapes of horror movies, bloody-looking props, TVs endlessly looping scary flicks, and drinks that cost just ¥666. The bar attracts a mixture of genuine horror buffs, as well as patrons lured by the lack of cover and cheap drinks. Deathmatch In Hell is a horror-themed bar bringing delightfully terrifying energy to the Tokyo bar scene. Drink among severed arms, terminator skulls, guitars, and skeletons as heavy metal music blares throughout the small seating area. The bloody circus of horror, metal, and alcohol is orchestrated by GO Nakajima, a man invariably sporting a Wayne’s World baseball cap with a great eye for gore and an even better hand for pouring solid drinks.",
