    "description": "Young Serbians are keen to celebrate the Yugoslav era, and offering tours of their country in vintage Yugos is a fun way of doing it‘Jump in, comrade,” my driver honks and calls out the window of the smallest, boxiest car I’ve ever seen: the communist vintage Yugo. I’m setting off on a tour of Yugoslav-era Belgrade with driver Vojin Žugić from Yugoverse tours, a company in the business of cold-war nostalgia. The car is a time capsule, with its little cube headlights, cranky gear stick and cassette player. Its horn sounds delightfully cheeky, and the smell of diesel and old leather seats is strong. We trundle around the Serbian capital for half a day, taking in communism’s most striking bridges and sites, honking merrily at the many drivers who overtake us. All of them smile and wave, for the Yugo holds fond memories in this part of the world.Driving around the hippodrome next to Ada Bridge, or under the gravity-defying arch of the experimental brutalist Genex tower, it’s easy to get caught up in Žugić’s nostalgia – even though he’s only 24. “I love the feel of the mechanics, the simple geometry,” he says of the car. We park at the tower and take the lift to the top floor at 140 metres for spectacular city views from its spaceship-like windows. When it was designed in 1977, this was architecture of an imagined socialist utopia. Though the concrete is a bit shabby up close, the tower has kept its photogenic appeal. Just like our Yugo.

    "description": "The people of the Sierra Norte have achieved a rare balance – preserving an ancient way of mountain life while welcoming visitorsWhen I reach the mountaintop chapel, I slump on the dry stone wall, wheezing in the thin air, marvelling at what combination of brawn and piety must have been needed to build such a thing at such a height. It might not be a Sunday, but I can tell that mass at 3,000 metres must be magnificent. Open walls reach out to the rolling slopes of the Sierra Norte, 35 miles east of Oaxaca City in southern Mexico, with virgin pine in every direction. Somewhere unseen, a brown-backed solitaire bird lifts a lonely song over the valley. Then comes the bark of warring crows and, most exciting of all, the quick peeps of a hummingbird, believed here to ferry messages between the living and dead. At this height, even to a heathen like me, the urge to pay tribute is understandable.My guide, Eric, who must have a third lung, judging by his ability to tell stories on the climb, becomes quiet and crosses himself before the altar. I’m a little surprised at this show of devotion. Down in the small town of Tlacolula de Matamoros, he had shown us a site the Indigenous Zapotecs used to praise the sacred mountain above – before the Spanish came and plonked a church on the same spot. The colonialists’ intention, Eric explained, was erasure. But when conversion comes at the point of a sword, some resistance seems inevitable. Here, Indigenous signs hide in Catholic icons. Dark stones in holy corners hold animist engravings. Duality is everywhere. Praise whispered in the name of the Virgin of Guadalupe, the mother of Christ to Mexican Catholics, is also meant for Huitzilopochtli, the old sun god. Continue reading...",

Martin was only 8 years old when he was killed in the Boston Marathon Bombing in 2013. Right next to Boston Children's Museum, the tree walk and herb garden at Martin's Park support the environment while a replica ship ignites youngsters' imaginations. The park also features a bridge, water area, individual and group swings, slides, rope climbers, and more. All structures are designed to ensure children of limited physical, social/emotional, sensory, cognitive, and communication abilities can enjoy their visit.  Martin Richard has gone before us, but his legacy lives on in this park that celebrates all of its visitors.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-maruxaina",
    "description": "The rocky Farallóns islets off the picturesque fishing village of San Ciprián, Spain, are home to a bronze mermaid. The sculpture was made by artist Ángel Cao in 2006. The mermaid represents a long debated local legend. Some say that she warns of the worst storms, while others think that she is evil and jealous of the wives of fishermen, leading her to try to steal men away to her underwater palace. The Maruxaina, as this Galician mermaid of folklore is called, has the strange habit of showing up on Isla Sombriza, one of the islets near the harbor, during raging storms. On days with heavy rain and wind she suddenly appears. Sometimes she appears as a beautiful blonde-haired mermaid who, like Ulysses, attracts sailors with her irresistible song. But on other occasions she shows her worst face, like that of a witch with sunken eyes and sinister intentions. The legend has been perpetuated by the various shipwrecks that have occurred on this treacherous coast. To determine whether she is innocent or guilty, on the second Saturday of every August, the village of San Ciprián celebrates the Maruxaina festival. At dusk, the lights of the town are turned off and the men go out to sea in search of the Maruxaina, sounding all kinds of horns and trumpets so as not to hear the hypnotizing song of the siren. After her capture, the men return to the beach of O Torno with a figure that represents her. Amid fireworks, they take her to the town square where a trial is held. If it is determined that she has had bad intentions, she is burned on a large pyre and the party ends. If the woman is deemed good, the party will continue until dawn.",
