    "description": "In the rugged Maiella national park, a secluded campsite offers everything from pitches to hotel-style rooms, guided walks to Abruzzo hospitalityThere was a shift in atmosphere as a pewter cloud rumbled overhead. As we approached the end of our walk in the Maiella national park, we stopped beside the remains of a second world war prison camp, deep in the park’s corn-coloured hills, and Lisa, our guide, told us a story as dramatic as the simmering sky. In 1943, a band of prisoners, including New Zealand corporal John Broad, fled the camp and spent seven bitter winter months hiding out in caves before eventually making it across British lines. That they survived was thanks to the kindness and bravery of local families, who risked their own safety, and hunger, to help them stay alive and avoid German patrols.Lisa told us that Broad later described the impoverished Abruzzesi as the country’s true gold, and the sun suddenly sliced through the cloud as though in divine agreement, painting the mountains opposite a shimmering bronze. Digesting both the story and the scenery, our small group of 12 were quietly contemplative as we picked our way back down the hillside to Dimore Montane, the campground we were staying at. The advancing evening turned the sky from lemon to peach to vivid negroni as we skittered down cobbled paths between pines, crossed sun-baked meadows rippled with lilac thistles, and strode past ancient tholoi, the sculptural stone shelters built by local shepherds.

The best tip wins £200 towards a Coolstays breakWhen it comes to planning a trip, how we travel is just as important as where we go – the connections we make, the insights into different cultures and, hopefully, a sense that our visit is having a positive impact on the communities that host us. We’d love to hear about the community tourism initiatives that you’ve encountered on your travels, whether it was a wilderness lodge or trekking company owned and run by locals, a cultural exchange programme, or a conservation project perhaps.If you have a relevant photo, do send it in – but it’s your words that will be judged for the competition.

    "description": "Dinah the Pink Dinosaur greets visitors entering Vernal, Utah. Originally, the 40-foot tall figure welcomed patrons of the town's Dine-a-Ville Motel. Designed and built in 1958 by motel owner Helen Millecam, the dinosaur seemed like a perfect icon for the new business located near Dinosaur National Monument, where many apatosaurus fossils had been discovered. Construction of the dino was contracted out to the Young Brothers Electric Sign Company, who were also responsible for other novelty signs such as Downtown Las Vegas' \"Vegas Vic.\" Naturally, they designed Dinah's eyes and the sign she held to glow. With an interior of steel, fiberglass, and wire mesh, the dinosaur weighs over a ton. When the motel closed and was demolished in 1999, Dinah's fate was uncertain. As a loved symbol of the city, she was saved and moved to city property along US-40. Although her long tail fell off during a 2023 vehicle accident, it was reattached soon after. Today, Dinah's eye still glow as she now holds a sign promoting the city, which calls itself \"Dinosaurland.\"",

    "description": "Few items are more synonymous with the United Kingdom than a red phone booth. Even with the advent of mobile phones, tourists still line up to have their pictures taken with these symbolic relics of a bygone age. But in Bath, England, one phone booth is painted in an atypical hue. This phone booth, situated where Brock Street becomes Royal Crescent, is one of England’s only grey phone booths.  A placard posted on the window reads: “This K6 telephone kiosk designed in 1935 to mark King George V's jubilee, was one of 70,000 between 1936 and 1968 in the U. K.. Whilst red is seen as an iconic color, when first introduced there was an outcry over these intrusive bright features. The General Post Office sanctioned the muted colors of battleship grey with glazing bars 'picked out' in red, in areas of natural and architectural beauty. This was such an area, and a rare surviving example of a grey K6.”",
