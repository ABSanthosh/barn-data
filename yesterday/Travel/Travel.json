    "description": "The Maasroute is the ideal entry-level, multiday bike trip for young children – flat with plenty of riverside cafes, family-friendly campsites and ice-cream stops en routeAs early as I can remember, I’ve always got a thrill out of poring over a map, tracing wavy river lines with my fingers, roads that connect and borders that divide – all the routes I could take. The freedom of heading out on my bike and not knowing where I’m going to pitch my tent that night. Now that my children are aged seven and nine, I wanted to introduce them to the liberation of this kind of adventure. They adore a day out on their bikes, but this was to be our first multiday bike trip as a family of four, so it was crucial to find a route easy and fun enough to captivate them.The Maasroute follows the course of the Maas River as it meanders for 300 miles (484km) through the Netherlands, from the inland city of Maastricht to the Hook of Holland, then loops back to Rotterdam. It forms part of the much longer Meuse cycle route (EuroVelo 19) that stretches from the source of the Maas (or Meuse as it’s known in France) on the Langres plateau, travelling through the French and Belgian Ardennes before crossing into the Netherlands.

    "description": "Finns’ deep affinity with nature is blossoming in its restaurants, where a new generation of chefs are fusing local wild produce with more exotic flavours – all at reasonable pricesUnexpectedly, porridge is a Finnish obsession, available in petrol stations, schools and on national airline flights. But Helsinki’s gastronomic offerings are a lot wilder, featuring reindeer, moose, pike perch, salmon soup, herring, seaweed – and even bear meat. And from summer into autumn, Finns’ deep affinity with nature blossoms, fusing local organic produce with foraged berries and mushrooms. This inspires menus to feature whimsical fusions of textures and flavours, all straight from the land.Garlanded with superlatives, from “friendliest” and “happiest” to “world’s most sustainable city”, this breezy Nordic capital is fast catching up on its foodie neighbours. Enriched by immigrant chefs, the youthful, turbocharged culinary scene now abounds in excellent mid-range restaurants with affordable tasting menus – although wine prices are steep (from €10/£8.60 for a 120ml glass). Vegan and vegetarian alternatives are omnipresent, as are non-alcoholic drinks, many berry based. Tips are unnecessary, aesthetics pared down, locals unostentatious and dining starts early, at 5pm. And, this being Finland, you can digest your meal in a sauna, whether at an island restaurant (Lonna) or high in the sky on the Ferris wheel (SkySauna). Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/matilda-joslyn-gage-burial-site",
    "description": "In a Fayetteville, New York, cemetery is the gravestone of a largely forgotten suffragist leader, which makes a powerful, uncompromising statement. In the quiet Fayetteville Cemetery, amid rows of conventional memorials, stands a monument that speaks with a voice of radical conviction. It marks the final resting place of Matilda Joslyn Gage, a pioneering suffragist, abolitionist, and freethinker whose contributions to American history were for a time nearly erased. The rough-hewn stone is etched with a sentiment as bold today as it was at the time of her death in 1898: “There is a word sweeter than mother, home, or heaven — that word is liberty.” This striking epitaph was Gage’s lifelong motto, a distillation of her unwavering dedication to the complete liberation of all people. Alongside Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Gage was a foundational figure in the women’s suffrage movement. Yet, her views were often more radical than her contemporaries. She fought not just for the vote, but for women’s reproductive autonomy, critiqued the patriarchal structures of the church, and advocated for the rights of Native Americans, which led to her honorary adoption into the Wolf Clan of the Mohawk Nation. Her childhood home in Cicero, New York, was a station on the Underground Railroad, a testament to her early and active role in the abolitionist movement. Gage’s influence extended into the realm of fantasy through her son-in-law, L. Frank Baum. The author of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was profoundly shaped by Gage's feminist and progressive ideals, with many scholars seeing the strong, independent female characters in the Land of Oz as a direct reflection of her powerful mother-in-law. After her death, Gage’s more radical ideas led to her being largely written out of the history of the suffrage movement she helped build. Her gravestone, however, remains an unyielding testament to her core belief. It is a stark, powerful, and thought-provoking declaration from a woman who valued freedom above all else, a hidden monument to a true American radical.",

    "description": "In 1962, a partial mastodon skeleton was unearthed in Tualatin near where its public library now stands. Originally on display at Portland State University until being stored away sometime in the 1970s, the nearly half-complete skeleton was cleaned and restored for display in the library. The exhibit is offset against a frosted glass image of what the mastodon would look like in life. The mastodon was a female who expired in her 20s and is believed to have died about 14,000 years ago.  Many other ice age artifacts are on display in the library including the sacrum (a bone connected to the pelvis) of a giant ground sloth, mammoth bones and bones from other animals. Additional pieces include small glacial erratics, and replicas of an ancient bison skull, mastodon tooth, and mastodon tusk.",
