    "description": "Finns’ deep affinity with nature is blossoming in its restaurants, where a new generation of chefs are fusing local wild produce with more exotic flavours – all at reasonable pricesUnexpectedly, porridge is a Finnish obsession, available in petrol stations, schools and on national airline flights. But Helsinki’s gastronomic offerings are a lot wilder, featuring reindeer, moose, pike perch, salmon soup, herring, seaweed – and even bear meat. And from summer into autumn, Finns’ deep affinity with nature blossoms, fusing local organic produce with foraged berries and mushrooms. This inspires menus to feature whimsical fusions of textures and flavours, all straight from the land.Garlanded with superlatives, from “friendliest” and “happiest” to “world’s most sustainable city”, this breezy Nordic capital is fast catching up on its foodie neighbours. Enriched by immigrant chefs, the youthful, turbocharged culinary scene now abounds in excellent mid-range restaurants with affordable tasting menus – although wine prices are steep (from €10/£8.60 for a 120ml glass). Vegan and vegetarian alternatives are omnipresent, as are non-alcoholic drinks, many berry based. Tips are unnecessary, aesthetics pared down, locals unostentatious and dining starts early, at 5pm. And, this being Finland, you can digest your meal in a sauna, whether at an island restaurant (Lonna) or high in the sky on the Ferris wheel (SkySauna). Continue reading...",

    "description": "The Via delle Valli is a series of 50 trails aiming to tempt mountain-lovers away from the region’s hotspots and towards lesser-charted countryThick white cloud hangs outside the windows of Rifugio Segantini, a mountain hut 2,373 metres up in the Italian Alps. But it is shifting, revealing glimpses of the majestic Brenta Dolomites before us: a patch of snow here, a craggy peak there. The view is tantalising, and a couple of times I have run outside in a kind of peekaboo farce to see the full display, only for it to pass behind clouds again.The refuge – cosy, wooden-clad and packed with hikers – is named after the Italian landscape painter Giovanni Segantini, who was inspired by these mountains. His portrait hangs on the walls and his name is embroidered on the lace curtains. A simple stone building with blue and white shutters in Val d’Amola, the refuge is dwarfed by its rugged surrounds, with Trentino’s highest peak, the snow-capped 3,556-metre Presanella, as a backdrop. The entries in the guestbook are entirely by locals. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Just north of the city of Jericho, Hisham’s Palace is a sprawling archeological site which contains renovated ruins of an ancient estate — including a palace, bathhouse, mosque, grape press, and more. Inside the palace is one of the world’s largest mosaic carpets, which underwent restoration and opened to the public in 2021. The estate is a prime example of Umayyad-era ingenuity and artistry, including ancient plumbing systems which are similar to those used today. The site is undergoing continuing excavations as archeologists learn more about its connections to Islamic and Middle Eastern history.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cresson-sanatorium-and-prison",
    "description": "The monstrous site of Cresson Sanatorium and Prison is situated on land donated by steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie. Established by an Act of Assembly in June 1910, the Cresson Tuberculosis Sanatorium opened in 1913. Due to the vast sprawling land and fresh air, it was deemed ideal for the treatment of the quickly spreading disease: tuberculosis. Decades later, with the introduction of new pharmaceutical aids, sanatoriums were on the decline and ultimately deemed unnecessary.  In December 1956, Cresson was incorporated into the Lawrence F. Flick State Hospital. This former tuberculosis ward would now facilitate the care of the mentally unstable under the Department of Public Welfare until December of 1982. In 1983, Cresson was converted into a state correctional facility by the Bureau of Corrections under executive order 1983-1 by Governor Dick Thornburgh. The redesign of Cresson to accommodate these needs would cost $20.6 million and began in 1984. These newly revised plans for inmate housing would serve as the template for similar institutions erected across the state. In 1987, Cresson opened its doors to inmate populations. It officially closed on June 30, 2013. The sanatorium and prison is now known for its purportedly haunted status, with reports of eerie sound and apparitions in its halls.",
