    "description": "From a hidden gem in Nice to a rustic revelation in Beaujolais and a bargain bistro in BrittanyFar away from the tourist traps of the old town, tiny seafood restaurant Coquillages Bouchet on Rue Rusca is a relative newcomer in Nice. Tucked away on a sidestreet near the port, the menu is short and the atmosphere relaxed. The young owners, Nicolas and Hugo, are best friends and their passion for fresh seafood, especially sea urchins and oysters, simply radiates. If you’re after fancy, go to one of the exclusive beach clubs dotted along the coastline. If you want fresh, vibrant and delicious platters of seafood served with charm and glasses of ice-cold white wine, come here.Melanie Clarkson Continue reading...",

    "description": "A renovated lighthouse on the Bay of Biscay is the perfect base for exploring Asturias’s maritime delightsI have always longed to be a lighthouse keeper and now, at last, I am one. If only for the weekend. Look at my chunky-knit jumper! Feel the waterproof weave of my Donegal tweed cap! Truth be told, I am way too toasty in this quasi-nautical ensemble, having hoped and dressed for ominous fog, murderous gales and oceanic rainstorms. Instead, it is bright, calm and warm on an early spring afternoon in the famously pretty fishing village of Cudillero in Asturias, where the Costa Verde of northern Spain drops away into the deep blue Bay of Biscay.Built in 1858, the local lighthouse – the Faro de Cudillero – stands on a shelf of rock just beyond the harbour, a short walk up stone steps and along a narrow cliff side service path. Its hexagonal beacon tower has been remodelled a few times over the years. The signal lamp inside was first fuelled by olive oil, then paraffin and petrol, before being electrified and eventually automated. With no further need for a human operator, its sturdy keeper’s cottage was left derelict decades ago. It’s sad to contemplate that absence, and the general obsolescence of the role itself. But if I can’t man the light, I can at least occupy the lighthouse. Continue reading...",

And yet, Tal Barahi Temple is a two-story pagoda built on an island in Pokhara, India's Phewa Lake.  The temple is dedicated to the Hindu goddess Barahi. Barahi is known in Nepal as a manifestation of Durga, a major Hindu goddess, and Amija, a group of deities representing female ancestors.  Visitors can access the island by private boat or kayak. The island offers beautiful views of the Annapurna range and World Peace Pagoda on clear days.",

It is home to the 100-ton Rycom aquarium in an otherwise unassuming location for marine wildlife.  This 100-ton aquarium houses fish representing the region's native marine inhabitants. More than 1,000 fish representing dozens of species are located within the aquarium, along with spineless aquatic invertebrates like sea cucumbers and stars. The aquarium overlaps with the first-floor elevator, giving shoppers a chance to observe animals like the endangered Napoleon wrasse. Two-inch clownfish can be seen mingling with zebra sharks reaching nearly 14 feet in length, while massive moray eels swim alongside schools of damselfish and cardinalfish.  Staff from the nearby Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium care for the Rycom aquarium, ensuring the safety of endemic fish and quality of the mall facilities.",
