    "description": "A boat trip to Denmark’s South Funen archipelago takes in the North Sea coast, the historic Kiel canal and the Baltic before delivering its crew to an idyllic island rich in maritime cultureA south-westerly wind blew us to Ærø. This little Baltic island (pronounced Air-rue) in Denmark’s South Funen archipelago is home to some 6,000 fortunate residents who enjoy free bus services, shallow swimming beaches and picture-perfect villages. The 54 sq mile island has a history of building sailing ships and there is an excellent maritime museum, so it seemed appropriate to arrive on a historic wooden sailing boat, Peggy, a Bristol pilot cutter built in 1903.“We’re going to Ærø without a plane,” quipped one crew member as we set the sails on leaving the German Baltic port of Kiel. Our overland journey from the UK had started with a 12-hour train trip from London to Cuxhaven, a German port on the North Sea; a short taxi ride to Cuxhaven marina; an overnight stay on Peggy in the marina; and then a two-day transit of the Kiel canal, the busiest in the world by number of vessels, with some 35,000 ships transiting annually.

    "description": "Since the 2016 peace treaty, Mesetas has embraced its natural assets and visitors have flocked to enjoy the region’s unique biodiversity. But the threat of violence is never far awayPhotographs by Antonio CascioTen years ago, violent conflict made it impossible for tourists to enjoy the natural riches of Mesetas. The town was one of the centres of the armed conflict that ravaged Colombia for decades, claiming nearly half a million lives.But since the historic peace treaty in 2016, with efforts to uphold it now led by the leftist president, Gustavo Petro, the people of Mesetas have had their hopes raised for a better life, thanks to those natural assets.

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/parkside-plum-juice",
    "description": "Taiwan is known as the birthplace of bubble tea, but there’s much more to the beverage scene here. Take this shop, for example. It has been selling just one drink, plum juice (suanmeitang), for over 60 years, and it’s still a favorite for both locals and visitors. Parkside is definitely one of the most famous among shops dedicated to the specialty drink of plum juice, and the namesake comes from its location right next to the 228 Memorial Park. Plum juice take much effort and care to make. Sour plums are soaked and boiled with ingredients like licorice root, dried plums, osmanthus, and hawthorn, then sweetened and chilled. It’s usually made in big pots and served cold. This juice shop has a modest start. Initially, the owner sold the drink on a cart, and drinks came in plastic bags with a rubber band and a straw  In 1969, the shop moved into its current spot. If you step back from the counter, you’ll see it’s inside a beautiful Western-style building, which is now a protected historic site. During the Japanese colonial era, it used to be a tailor shop. The plum juice is said to have the magic to cool people down, making here a perfect stop on a hot Taipei day. And if you want more,  you will be tempted to try the only other item on the menu—a simple, old-school scoop of traditional ice cream.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sanctuary-of-nossa-senhora-da-conceicao-da-muxima",
    "description": "Look at this church alone and one would be forgiven for thinking it is in Portugal. Zoom out, however, and it becomes apparent that this is Africa. More specifically, it is Angola, a former Portuguese colony and one of Africa’s most Catholic countries. As such, this Marian shrine holds special importance to many in this country, and it is considered the most important one in Sub-Saharan Africa. Like many colonial settlements, Muxima (meaning \"heart\" in Kimbundu) has an unfortunately dark past. A church was first founded here in 1599 along the Cuanza River, Angola's largest and a major slave trafficking route. As such, this is where the Portuguese baptized many slaves as Christians before taking them to the Americas. The current structure here was built in the 17th century after being razed by occupying Dutch forces. Over time, the church also became important for the Christianized locals. Numerous miracles were attributed to Nossa Senhora da Conceição da Muxima (Our Lady of the Conception of Muxima), an icon housed here. Her worship became as much a product of local traditions as it was of imported Portuguese ones. By 1833, an annual pilgrimage was being held here. It continues to this day, with over a million people now descending on the town every August 31 and September 1.",
