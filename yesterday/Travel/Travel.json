    "description": "The people of the Sierra Norte have achieved a rare balance – preserving an ancient way of mountain life while welcoming visitorsWhen I reach the mountaintop chapel, I slump on the dry stone wall, wheezing in the thin air, marvelling at what combination of brawn and piety must have been needed to build such a thing at such a height. It might not be a Sunday, but I can tell that mass at 3,000 metres must be magnificent. Open walls reach out to the rolling slopes of the Sierra Norte, 35 miles east of Oaxaca City in southern Mexico, with virgin pine in every direction. Somewhere unseen, a brown-backed solitaire bird lifts a lonely song over the valley. Then comes the bark of warring crows and, most exciting of all, the quick peeps of a hummingbird, believed here to ferry messages between the living and dead. At this height, even to a heathen like me, the urge to pay tribute is understandable.My guide, Eric, who must have a third lung, judging by his ability to tell stories on the climb, becomes quiet and crosses himself before the altar. I’m a little surprised at this show of devotion. Down in the small town of Tlacolula de Matamoros, he had shown us a site the Indigenous Zapotecs used to praise the sacred mountain above – before the Spanish came and plonked a church on the same spot. The colonialists’ intention, Eric explained, was erasure. But when conversion comes at the point of a sword, some resistance seems inevitable. Here, Indigenous signs hide in Catholic icons. Dark stones in holy corners hold animist engravings. Duality is everywhere. Praise whispered in the name of the Virgin of Guadalupe, the mother of Christ to Mexican Catholics, is also meant for Huitzilopochtli, the old sun god. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Continually occupied from prehistory until today, the site of Flag Fen in the United Kingdom is home to a wide range of evidence and artifacts from different eras.  Most important is perhaps the preserved remains of the Fen Causeway, an ancient road through the Fens where many people would have convened. Raised above the then-undrained bog, the causeway was a massive timber construction from different species of trees. These peaty conditions are what lead to the quality of the road's preservation and its increased importance as a Neolithic site.  The museum is also home to a handful of reconstructions of Bronze Age roundhouses that housed the Britons who used the Causeway, allowing visitors to fully immerse themselves in what life was like thousands of years ago.",

    "description": "For centuries, the northeastern region of Portugal, known as Tràs-os-Montes e Alto Douro, was isolated from the rest of the country by mountain ranges, protecting unique cultural traditions. Inside the walls of the ancient castle of Bragança, a charming museum introduces visitors to one such culture: The cherished mask traditions of Northeastern Portugal and the Zamora district of Spain. These folk traditions are said to have Celtic origins (or Roman, depending on who you talk to) and have been maintained over generations, protected in part by the impenetrable landscape. Over three compact floors, visitors come face to face with masks and costumes that are designed to incite fear. The museum also offers insights into the rural communities who continue to don their masks every year in events such as the Caretos of Podence. Around Christmas or Carnival, many villages have their winter and spring festivals, where shaggy-costumed, masked revelers chase locals and visitors alike.",
