    "description": "In Melnik, Saint Trifon eclipses Saint Valentine as the town celebrates its long history of winemakingThe sun glows on the otherworldly shapes of the sandstone cliffs that have been sculpted by millennia of rain and left looking like someone tried to make sand castles but was too impatient to fill the bucket to the top. Jagged battlements and conical heaps stretch to the horizon.At the base of these cliffs stands a cluster of large, elegant houses. This is Melnik, Bulgaria’s smallest town, with just 194 residents. Despite its diminutive size, the town is famous as the heart of Bulgaria’s wine region. Every year, on 14 February, thousands of visitors arrive for Saint Trifon’s Day, a celebration of the patron saint of winemaking, which is a much bigger deal than Valentine’s Day, and dates back centuries.

    "description": "Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, is a feline paradise not unlike Istanbul. There are stray cats everywhere, a cuddly symbol of the city. In the heart of its old town stands the grand Chain Building, part of which pays subtle homage to the local cat population. Easy to miss if you don't know it's there, the so-called Cat's House of Icherisheher is a work of art consisting of two faux windows and sandstone sculptures: one with a pair of children, a boy and a girl, looking up with a kitten, and another with a trio of cats. The names of this installation vary, but typically referred to as either the \"Monument to Lovers and Cats\" or Pişiklər və Uşaqlar (\"Cats and Children\"). Some locals and tour guides claim that there is a sad legend behind this artwork, a story about a strict judge who once lived at the house with his two children and cats. According to it, one day, a cat fell out of the window, and the judge punished his children by pushing them out of the window. For his cruelty, the judge was then cursed for eternity. The artwork, however, is simply a monument to Baku and its beloved cats. It was created by sculptor Tarverdi Guliyev in 1994, commissioned by Eldar Mikayilzade, a renowned carpet artist whose designs have also been featured on Azerbaijani manat banknotes.",

    "description": "Pere Lachaise Cemetery covers an impressive 110 acres. In this vast expanse one will find many monuments and memorials dedicated to both heroes and casualties of various conflicts. One such unsettling shrine, which can be found on the exterior wall that surrounds the burial ground, depicts men and women crying out in agony. The images of the slaughtered are rather ethereal, appearing as ghostly figures emerging from the stonewall. This commemoration goes by many names. The one that is most often cited is 'The Victims of Revolutions,' however, it is frequently misidentified as \"The Wall of the Fédérés\" or Communard's Wall. In the later part of the 19th century, nearly 150 political objectors, made up of both men and women, where lined up against this wall in the burial ground and massacred. These martyred activists, referred to as Communards, were resisting the forces of the Franco-Prussian War. Their unpretentious monument can be located in the south-eastern corner of the cemetery.  French sculptor Paul Moreau-Vauthier (1871 - 1936), who happens to be laid to rest inside the cemetery, repurposed the original bullet-ridden stones from the massacre. His depiction of the travesty also heavily emulates the events, with a woman standing in front to protect those behind from the ensuing gunfire. On the lower left-hand side is a quote from the French author and novelist Victor Hugo (1802 - 1885)\" \"What we ask of the future, what we want from it, is justice, not vengeance!\"",
