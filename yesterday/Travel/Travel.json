The views were to die for, and in the summer there was still some light at midnight. No frills, but good-quality bathrooms. It was the best campsite we found in Norway and also the cheapest.Sarah Continue reading...",

    "description": "Inside the French capital’s ring road, the Petite Ceinture, a disused circular rail line, now abounds with nature trails, shared gardens – and even urban farmsA rustle in the undergrowth sends birds wheeling above the trees and into the sky. I’m left alone and in near total silence as I look along the train tracks that disappear in either direction. It feels as if I’m in the heart of the countryside, but actually, the Boulevard Périphérique, the traffic-choked ring road that encircles Paris, is just a stone’s throw away. This disused rail route, the Petite Ceinture, offers wildlife and quiet solitude just moments from the roaring motorway, thanks to a plan that is turning parts of the line into walkable green spaces – the French capital’s less manicured (and less central) alternative to Manhattan’s High Line or north London’s Parkland Walk, a rewilded railway line that’s part of the Capital Ring walk.Built on the site of the Thiers wall, the last defensive wall of Paris, and its surrounding shantytown, the eight-lane Boulevard Périphérique (known as the Périph) is used by more than a million cars a day. The 20-mile (32km) railway line just inside the ring road was created to supply the Thiers wall, carrying goods and then passengers as the city’s first metropolitan railway service.

    "description": "Sitting snug in a mid-city neighborhood just off Tulane Ave and Carrollton, near the southern terminus of Highway 61, Lisa Nelson, better known as Queen Trini Lisa, is dishing out some of the best Caribbean food in New Orleans. But rewind just a few years back. Lisa was running a small corner store in the Ninth Ward, serving classic New Orleans takeaways like po’boys, fried chicken, and simple plate lunches. In the backroom, she would cook food from her home country of Trinidad and Tobago for her children, the smells wafting through the closed doors into the front of the shop. Soon, her customers began asking to buy her children’s food.  “It was weird and I thought, this is nothing special… Why do they want this?” Nelson says with a laugh. So she started selling curries and jerk chicken a few days a week. “People would pop their head in and ask what I was cooking,” Nelson says. “If it wasn’t something from my home, they would say okay, see you tomorrow and leave. I started to realize that more people came to the shop when I cooked my food.” After leaving the corner store, Nelson did pop-ups around the city, garnering a name for herself amidst a burgeoning interest in the foods that created what we now know as classic New Orleans cuisine—the Caribbean and African influences ignored by chefs and diners alike for so long.  Nelson’s name is now mentioned alongside other local luminaries like Nina Compton and chef Serigne Mbaye, making her part of an important conversation happening around New Orleans cuisines and its deep roots around the world. Now, at her own space in mid-city, she can usually be found in the kitchen, surrounded by rising dough, simmering curries, chopped cabbage, steaming rice, and several family members.  The doubles—creamy chickpeas redolent in warm Indian spices and served on airy, chewy fried flatbreads, two to a serving—are a standout hit alongside her coco bread fish sandwich and award-winning jerk chicken. It’s hard to go wrong here, so have a seat outside, take a recommendation or two, and savor every bite.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/elsies-plate-pie",
    "description": "With its location in an unassuming building on a major thoroughfare, Elsie’s looks like an old-school diner and is easy to miss if you’re not paying attention. But turn the corner into their parking lot and you’re met with a bright pie-themed mural and an inviting entrance into their warm, modern-industrial dining room. The fare is classic Southern: boudin melts, fried okra, pimento dip, and red beans and rice with fried chicken. And then there are the pies. The savory selection includes a crawfish hand pie, a Natchitoches meat pie (one of the state’s official foods!), and their Louisiana poulet pot pie, filled with smoked chicken and peppers in a creamy tasso gravy.  The food is decadent and alive. The salt levels are just a bit high, and butter, cream, and other fats are used generously. Pork finds its way into most things. The portions are generous, but let’s face it, you’re not here for a modest meal. Elsie’s sweet pies also shine, including a chocolate pecan, a slight twist on a classic, and other staples like their s’mores, turtle, apple, and coconut cream pies.  If you show up on the day of an LSU football match, you might catch their game-day special “Eye of the Tiger” dessert—a lemon ice box pie with vanilla wafer crust and blueberry whipped cream, vibrant in the colors of their hometown team and a perfect balance of tart lemon and sweet blueberries. Even if there’s no game underway, in-the-know regulars will often special order it in advance.",
