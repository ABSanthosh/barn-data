    "description": "With volcanic peaks, wild flowers and hot springs, the Cantal region is the perfect destination for a springtime road tripGetting away from it all is surely the idea behind every holiday, yet as I drive through undulating countryside towards the village of Salers in France’s Massif Central, I wonder whether I’ve ever felt quite so away from everything.This is the appeal of the Cantal, the rural heartland of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, in which the Massif Central is nestled. If you continue east from the Dordogne and Lot, you’ll discover a land of volcanic peaks, hot springs and welcoming auberges in one of France’s least populated departments. And, as I learn, it makes for a refreshingly different destination for a springtime road trip. The snow lingers on those peaks until early April, but I’m here in early May and the meadows abound in an extraordinary display of wildflowers, such as arnica, narcissi, orchids and myriad other species that thrive in that volcanic soil. The landscape is one of the most richly biodiverse in Europe. Continue reading...",

    "description": "From spring blooms in the Netherlands to early sunshine in Sicily, our tipsters share their favourite seasonal escapesIn the Netherlands the Keukenhof near Lisse is well known for the beauty of its bulb fields in springtime. But if you are looking for a cycling holiday away from the crowds you’re better off heading 40 miles north to the Kop van Noord-Holland. Here you will find the largest contiguous bulb area in the country. April is the best time to cycle among the millions of colourful crocuses, daffodils, hyacinths and tulips. Between Schagen, Den Helder, Den Oever and Middenmeer you will find flower fields as far as the eye can see. I’d highly recommend the dune road from Callantsoog to Den Helder. The mostly well-paved surfaces are easy to cycle on and great for any fitness level. Peter Diender Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/108-grotto-tombs",
    "description": "The Ten-en hiking trail runs for nearly five miles through the northern mountain area of Kamakura, passing by a number of fascinating rock formations and centuries-old ruins and sculptures. Along the route, hikers may also find several yagura, rock-cut grotto-tombs typical of medieval Kamakura, which concentrate the most at the site called Hyakuhachi Yagura, or 108 Grotto Tombs. In Buddhist tradition, 108 is said to be the number of vices and desires carried by every person, and often used simply to denote a large number with religious undertones. It is believed that there are actually closer to 200 such tombs at this site. Hundreds of samurai, artists and monks of the upper class rest in peace in this troglodyte necropolis. Inside the grave grottoes are crumbling funerary pagodas and statuettes of the Buddha and Ksitigarbha, many of whose heads seem to have been cut off. This sacrilegious state was caused by to the superstition that carrying these heads would bring good luck, believed by local gamblers at the turn of the century. While the site seems long-abandoned and neglected for centuries, a few of the stelae mention Tokyo in their inscriptions, suggesting that they were erected after the city of Edo became Tokyo in 1868. Nevertheless, there is a spooky feel all around, and it is no wonder that some believe the site to be haunted.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/taiwan-stock-musuem",
    "description": "Hidden inside an unassuming office building in Taipei, the Taiwan Stock Museum sits within a former high-security vault, a fitting home for a collection that preserves Taiwan’s financial history. Unlike conventional museums, this space provides an in-depth look at stock certificates, securities trading, and the evolution of Taiwan’s stock market. The museum’s collection includes a range of historically significant stock certificates, from the earliest paper stocks issued in Taiwan to the highest face-value stock certificate ever printed—a Chunghwa Telecom share worth NT$281 billion. These artifacts illustrate the development of Taiwan’s economy and the transition from physical stock certificates to fully digital transactions. Beyond stock memorabilia, the museum serves as an educational resource for student groups and financial enthusiasts. Exhibits include interactive displays on Taiwan’s securities depository process that explain how shares are stored, transferred, and safeguarded. Visitors can also test their knowledge about the stock market through interactive games. Despite its compact size, the Taiwan Stock Museum presents a compelling narrative of Taiwan’s financial history and economic development. The Taiwan Stock Exchange was established in 1961, when Taiwan’s GDP per capita was less than $200. Today, Taiwan’s GDP per capita exceeds $30,000, and its stock market sometimes ranks among the top ten in the world by market value. The museum requires reservations, so plan ahead before visiting.",

I’m always disappointed when I meet travelers who cook all their meals in a hostel kitchen. It is possible to eat out on a budget, and I'll show you how! But many travelers have a valid concern when it comes to food — eating out all the time is expensive.  Imagine if you ate out every day — your food budget would be astronomical!
