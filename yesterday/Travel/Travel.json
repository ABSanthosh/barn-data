    "description": "Still gliding above the town of Wuppertal on an overhead track 125 years after it was built, the charming Schwebebahn has lost none of its magicIt’s easy to be seduced by the romance of train travel. Think of sleeper trains, boat trains, vintage steam railways, elegant dining cars. But it’s rare that an urban transport system can capture the imagination quite as much as the Wuppertal Schwebebahn in Germany caught mine, and that of anyone else who’s clapped eyes on the world’s oldest suspended railway.In October it will be 125 years since Kaiser Wilhelm II took a test ride in the Schwebebahn, just a few months before the hanging railway officially opened for business in March 1901. It was an incredible feat of engineering then, and remains so today. Even with sleek modern carriages having long replaced the original ones, it looks like something imagined by Jules Verne, with carriages smoothly gliding under the overhead track. They have even preserved the first 1901 carriage, nicknamed Kaiserwagen, which can be hired for private occasions. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-eye-of-god-newchurch-pendle",
    "description": "In the Pendle village of Newchurch, St. Mary's Church tower features a curious oval opening in its west face. Known locally as the 'Eye of God,' many debate whether the eye's purpose is practical or paranormal. The most straightforward explanation suggests that the eye served as an observation point. The church warden likely used it to monitor and prepare for approaching funeral and wedding processions. However, Pendle's history casts a shadow over this simple explanation. The region is infamous for its 1612 witch trials, where 12 individuals were accused of witchcraft. One of the accused, Anne Chattox, was accosed of desecrating graves in St. Mary's Churchyard to collect human remains. Given this context, it's easy to see why the 'Eye of God' has also been seen as a protective symbol—a stone sentinel guarding the area against the ill effects of witchcraft.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-govors-well",
    "description": "While one might not expect to find natural springs in central London, a few arise within the urban landscape. One such spring is located near the southwest corner of Kensington Gardens. This spring is commonly described as being an “ancient spring,” but it was only given the name St. Govor’s Well in 1856 by Benjamin Hall, the First Commissioner of Works who would later be entitled Lord Llanover. Hall chose the name St. Govor for the well as a reference to a sixth-century hermit who was the patron saint of a church in Llanover in Wales. Except for Hall’s connection to Llanover, this spring otherwise has no connection to St. Govor. The original nineteenth-century well built on this site was a shallow hole cut into the ground with a masonry wall.  Stairs on one side led downwards to a tap above a basin. The current cylindrical structure with the wrap-around inscription dates to 1976. Notably, the well makes a brief appearance in one of the chapters of Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens. In the chapter, a young girl named Mamie attempts to meet Peter Pan, who was living with the fairies in the park. To do so, Mamie needs to hide from the adults in the park until after the park closes and the fairies come out, so she hides in St. Govor’s Well. This scene is illustrated in some older editions of the book.",
