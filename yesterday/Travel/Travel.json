    "description": "Ten years ago, the late land artist Charles Jencks created Crawick Multiverse out of an ugly open-cast mine in southern Scotland. Today, it is an inspiring exploration of the universeThe sun warms my face as I pause between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies to gaze at the rolling hills of Dumfries and Galloway beyond. I am not, surprisingly enough, in outer space. I’m at the Crawick Multiverse, a cosmos-themed land art installation in the south of Scotland that was built on the site of an old open-cast coal mine and is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year.The galaxies here are huge, spiralling mounds of earth, their perimeters reaching out towards one another but never quite touching.

    "description": "Where rusted bolts and tattered fabric, three coach cars, a swayback flat car, and a coal car are found, visitors can almost hear echoes of the past as the breeze blows through the shattered windows of abandoned train cars. It's easy to imagine the 19th and early 20th-century passengers taking in the beauty of the lush forest preceding the major pass of Crawford Notch. Many such passengers would have boarded the Maine Central Railroad’s Mountain Division Line en route to one of the opulent resorts that dotted the tracks. Tourists who wish to take a similar journey may want to check out the Conway Scenic Railroad, which still offers rides through the notch.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stephen-douglas-speech-plaque",
    "description": "On July 6, 1860, Democratic presidential candidate Stephen A. Douglas attempted to woo the citizens of Hartford over to his side. Known as “Little Giant from Illinois,” Douglas spoke at the corner of Main and Pearl, his speech now commemorated by a plaque. A state's rights advocate in an abolitionist state, Douglas and his words—which have been lost to history—failed to persuade voters. He soundly lost the state in the election, ultimately losing the race to Abraham Lincoln.. Douglas passed away less than one year later.  Why is there a plaque memorializing Douglas' forgotten stump speech? No one seems to know. And yet, there it is on an exterior wall in downtown Hartford.  \"The 'Little Giant' from Illinois and presidential candidate campaigned on this site,\" the plaque reads. Stephen Douglas was not Connecticut’s ideal candidate, as the state was home to many publicly anti-slavery voices, including Harriet Beecher Stowe, Mark Twain, and William Loyd Garrison. Farmington, Connecticut, mere miles away from Hartford, was known as a strongly abolitionist town and a main point in the Underground Railroad. Yale University, too, was known for strong abolitionist leanings. Given the context, it's hard to say why this tiny, obscure plaque exists. But exist it does—across the street from M\u0026T Bank and right next to a CVS Pharmacy—inviting visitors to remember the \"Little Giant\" who could not persuade the people of Hartford.",
