    "description": "The city once neglected its most famous son. But this summer visitors can immerse themselves in a major new exhibition and see the artist’s restored studio, home and the landscapes that inspired himPaul Cezanne is everywhere in Aix-en-Provence: there are streets named after him as well as a school, a cinema and even a sandwich (a version of traditional pan bagnat but with goat’s cheese instead of tuna). And from late June, the whole city will go Cezanne mad, as the painter’s atelier, north of the centre, and the family home to the west reopen after an eight-year restoration.But during Cezanne’s lifetime, and for years after his death in 1906, Aix seemed at pains to ignore the artist later called the “father of modern art”. When his widow, Hortense, offered several paintings to the city’s main Musée Granet, director Henri Pontier declared that Cezanne paintings would enter the gallery only over his dead body.

    "description": "The broadcaster and author can’t get enough of this stretch of England’s south coast, and has even set his first murder mystery thereMy earliest memory of Devon is being lost, and my mum crying. I was at junior school. I had a friend whose mother was described as “vague” – this was the 1970s, so that could have been code for almost anything. The vague mother had given my normally quite organised mother directions to a remote house where my schoolfriend spent his summers. We were “popping in” (70s code: spending the day there). The instructions to find the place were something like, “Turn left after South Zeal, pass the dirt track and follow the direction the sheep are facing.”After an hour of pretending we were still on the right route, my mum suddenly burst into tears and uttered a rare denunciation of a fellow human being. “That SILLY woman!” she shouted. “We don’t know where we are. Nobody does.” Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/straat",
    "description": "While Amsterdam is known for its museums of fine art, particularly the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum, the art on display at STRAAT is far less conventional. Conceived of in 2015 and opened in 2020, STRAAT features the artistic works of a broad range of internationally-renown street artists. STRAAT is located within a former Netherlands Dock and Shipbuilding Company building that previously stood abandoned for decades, attracting taggers, before the facility was converted into a museum. Most of the “curated” works by the street artists are displayed on very large “canvases” within the museum’s cavernous central hall, which has a height of three stories and a floor area of over 8,000 square meters. Additionally, the interior space contains a few statues and other objects (including a delivery van hanging from the ceiling). The building also still retains some of the machinery and other structures from its industrial past. The museum’s exterior features a couple of larger images, including a towering depiction of Anne Frank above the museum entrance. The building and surrounding area still attract many taggers and other street artists, who are welcome to paint on the outside of the museum. It may even be possible to see people at work when visiting STRAAT.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-charles-church",
    "description": "After the United Kingdom passed the Slave Trade Act of 1807, Freetown in the new colony of Sierra Leone became the hub of British anti-slavery activity in West Africa. The West Africa Squadron of the Royal Navy would patrol the coast looking for illegal slave-trading ships and capture them, bringing them to Freetown to undergo the legal proceedings that would see the ship impounded and the captured Africans released. However, the Africans were not returned to their homelands. Instead, they were resettled within the colony as the colony’s leaders hoped to make the endeavor profitable via agricultural export. Towards this end, Governor Charles MacCarthy established the “village system,” in which the “liberated Africans” were settled in villages in the modern-day Western Area of Sierra Leone. One of these villages was Regent, originally known as Hogbrook. An important feature of the village system as envisioned by Governor MacCarthy was that each town would be “managed” by a missionary from the Church Missionary Society. Preaching from a parish church, the missionaries aimed to convert the liberated Africans to Christianity. The Reverent William Augustine Bernard Johnson, known as W.A.B. Johnson, arrived in Regent in 1816. He preached from St. Charles’ Church, named in honor of Governor MacCarthy and completed that same year, thus predating St. George’s Cathedral in Freetown (completed 1817). Reverend Johnson was immensely popular—the large crowds he attracted necessitated expansions to the new church. Johnson's magnetism helped make Regent one of the most successful of the village system towns (in the eyes of the colonial government) due to its agricultural output. Regent produced more surplus coconuts and cassava than did any other village. After the death of Reverend Johnson in 1823, attendance at St. Charles’ Church dropped, but the church has been maintained throughout the centuries. Certainly the oldest stone church in Sierra Leone, St. Charles' Church is typically also billed as one of the oldest stone churches in West Africa if not Africa entirely. As a church with an active congregation, it has been maintained and is still in use today by the people of Regent.",
