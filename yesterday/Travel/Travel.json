To be able to fish the River Itchen for free is a gift; this is the same river that Frederic Halford and GEM Skues fished more than 100 years ago, starting fly-fishing as we know it today. Shrimp and caddis patterns work best for fly fishing here. It’s rare to see rising trout in these town waters except during the mayfly season so time your fishing trip appropriately if it’s trout you’re after. The mayfly season is not exact but it tends to run between late May and early June here. winchester.gov.uk Continue reading...",

I’m waist deep in the swell and suck of The Kattegat sea off the Danish island of Læsø, armed with a plastic tub and some kitchen scissors, gathering seaweed.“Ten years ago I went to a lecture on Japanese seaweed. The expert was talking about the best place in Denmark to harvest seaweed – and it was Læsø. I’m so lucky it was Læsø,” says Ladefoged. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Built in 1960 to be the administrative centre of the new state, this strange, Brutalist behemoth has never been occupied due to structural issues. The interior remains unfinished and unusable. In 1945, following the Nazi defeat, the Soviet Union claimed the Königsberg area from Germany. They kicked the entire German population out, brought in their own people, and updated the city’s name to Kaliningrad. In an effort to clean up after World War II bombardments, the remains of the heavy-hit, historical Königsberg castle were demolished to make place for its successor: The House Of Soviets. In 1970, construction started and the foundation of the building was built on top of the castle's ruins. Which, in turn, was already built on mushy ground. That proved to be a very bad idea. Even with the originally planned 28 stories already lowered to a more modest 21 stories, construction still couldn't be finished. Then, in 1985, fifteen years after its inception and with the building still unfinished, the regional USSR committee lost interest in the project.  In 2005, and the 60th anniversary of Kaliningrad, Russian President Vladimir Putin chose to visit the city. To honor his presence, the locals decided to paint the building a cheerful, pastel blue and finally add some windows, just 35 years after the original construction. Today, the entrance of the building is still closed off, but that hasn't saved the structure from vandalism. Many of the windows are now shattered and graffiti marks the walls, extending up to the roof.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fannin-battleground-state-historic-site",
    "description": "In the dark days after the fall of the Alamo, on March 6, 1836, James Fannin, commander of the Texian garrison at Goliad, was frozen with indecision. He had fortified the mission grounds of La Bahia, but recent defeats at Refugio and San Antonio made the fort vulnerable to the advancing Mexican armies under General Jose de Urrea and Santa Anna. By the time word came from General Sam Houston, ordering the Texians under Fannin to fall back to Victoria, General Urrea’s troops were already approaching Goliad. Fannin finally ordered a retreat, and on the morning of March 19, he and his 300 men abandoned the fort. They carried 1,000 muskets and nine cannons, but very little food or water as they headed east towards Victoria. Urrea’s men caught them less than a mile from the relative safety of a tree line on high ground and surrounded the Texians in a small patch of low, dry prairie. As Fannin’s men set up a defensive square, Urrea sent word back to newly-captured Goliad for reinforcements and artillery. A little after 1:30 p.m. the battle commenced, and by the evening of the 19th, the Texians counted seven killed and 28 wounded. The next morning, the Mexican artillery reinforcement had arrived, and the Texians had no choice but to surrender. Fannin believed he and his men would be treated as prisoners of war and paroled back to the United States, but Urrea could not promise this as Santa Anna had standing orders that all who take up arms against the Mexican government were to be executed as pirates. The Texians were marched back to La Bahia and shot on March 27 in what is now called the Goliad Massacre. A small group of prisoners were spared or escaped the execution. From eyewitness accounts, the site of the Battle of Coleto Creek was marked with a pile of stones after the defeat of the Mexican army at San Jacinto on April 21, 1836. In 1894, a local farmer named Sol Parks placed a cotton gin screw at the site of Fannin’s surrender, which still stands near the entrance to the park today.",
