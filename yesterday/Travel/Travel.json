    "description": "A decades-long crackdown on organised crime is opening up Catania, with previous no-go areas now welcoming tourists and new businesses. Discover its restaurants and bars before the prices catch upIn 1787, Goethe wrote: “To have seen Italy without having seen Sicily is not to have seen Italy at all, for Sicily is the clue to everything.” I’d go one step further and claim it’s impossible to really understand what makes the island tick without visiting Catania.Located on the east coast of the island, Catania is Sicily’s second-largest city and has been dubbed the Black City because of how prominently basalt features in its baroque architecture. Until recently this Unesco world heritage city, whose beauty can more than compete with its flashier neighbours, Palermo and Taormina, was blighted by organised crime and bad governance. But this is now changing, and fast. A decades-long crackdown on the Cosa Nostra has borne fruit, and previously no-go areas are now welcoming tourists and new businesses. My father’s family hails from San Cristoforo, the city’s poorest neighbourhood, and our conversations often centre on how the good times are finally arriving in Catania. But price points haven’t yet caught up with the city’s new-found buzz, especially in its many restaurants. Continue reading...",

    "description": "How an enterprising couple have transformed their farm into a bucolic base amid cider orchards and vines – perfect for exploring an ancient landscape and flourishing arts sceneIn Old English its name meant “the land of the summer people”, after the local practice of coming down to the Somerset Levels after the winter flooding receded. Today, Somerset is still somewhere where seasons are felt vividly, as Sophie Brendel and Panu Long discovered when they and their two children moved to Thornfalcon, their farmstead in a village of the same name, 15 minutes’ drive from Taunton, at the end of 2022. Here, they are on constant weather watch, tending their young vines (Panu, now a winemaker, has a background in the drinks industry) and harvesting daily from the kitchen garden. They are also busy making plans for the apple harvest, which will go into the 150-year-old cider press.In addition, they have created a handful of places to stay on their 16-hectare (40-acre) site, which sprawls through woods, orchards and vines to a reed-fringed lake. Walking around it at the end of May, you feel the cusp of summer, from the water lilies coming into bloom and the nesting swan, guarded by her mate. “Soon the eggs will hatch, and later she’ll teach the cygnets to fly, before taking them down to the Somerset Levels,” says Sophie.

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wwi-firing-walls",
    "description": "Among the trees and trails of Wellesley Woodland in Aldershot, a town whose history deeply is tied to the British Army, stand the remnants of a World War I machine gun range. Aldershot had, by the dawn of the 20th century, transformed from a small village into the undisputed “Home of the British Army.” This transformation saw Aldershot become, by 1914, the largest army camp in the country, housing 20 percent of the entire British Army. These two brick walls, now surrounded by tranquil trees and public trails, recall the area’s former life as a Ministry of Defense site and provide a hint at the training completed by soldiers preparing for one of history’s deadliest wars. The precise origins of these walls remain shrouded in the mists of time and military confidentiality. However, the bricks themselves offer a clue, since they were produced by a company that closed in 1930, placing the wall’s construction before then, likely within the tumultuous years of World War I.  While the western wall is a peppered face of bare brick, the eastern wall is reinforced with a 12.5mm thick iron plate, an indication of the escalating firepower and intensity of training exercises. Both the metal and the bricks bear the indelible scars of countless bullet holes, all that remains of the countless rounds that once echoed through this now peaceful woodland.",

    "description": "Enscherange is a small village located two kilometers north of the village of Lellingen, which is famous for its Via Botanica. As hikers leave Enscherange in an eastern direction, they will notice a curious structure along a country road: a metal post in the middle of a paved circle accompanied by a sundial and an explanatory plaque. This post marks Kiischpelt Sun Circle, the intersection of the 50th parallel of northern latitude with the 6th meridian of eastern longitude. It is the only place in Luxembourg where a parallel of a full degree of latitude intersects a meridian of a full degree of longitude. Apart from the intersections of the Greenwich meridian and those at the equator, it seems that there are only about 10 such intersections marked by monuments in the world.  The pole is surrounded by other wooden posts which mark the four cardinal points and the angles of sunrise and sunset at the solstices. Next to the pole, an explanatory panel in Lëtzebuergesch and French provides all the necessary information. There is a bench where visitors can enjoy the view over the valley of the Clerve.",
