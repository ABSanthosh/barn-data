    "description": "A German couple who renovate abandoned wooden houses and rent them out offer a window onto a traditional way of life in the north of the country Cattle are lumbering home in the twilight, horse-drawn farm carts trundle by and shepherds huddle around bonfires. We spy a woman milking her one cow in her garden and another, ancient-looking but upright, strolling back from the field, hoe over one shoulder. Traditional houses are made entirely of wood, roofs included, and many are dwarfed by ornate carved gateways, with tiled roof and massive beam across the top.We could be in south-east Asia, but this fairytale world of time-honoured custom and lives lived close to the land is a lot nearer home – in south-eastern Europe.

    "description": "This epic but comfortable and surprisingly quick journey sets you up perfectly to explore Tunisia’s ancient sites, cuisine and medinas‘Go on, try one,” says the man behind a mountain of Arabic sweets. He hands me a piece of makroudh, a honey-dipped semolina and date delicacy. It is still warm from deep frying and deliciously soft and sticky. I’m standing on an intersection between two cobbled medina streets in Tunis, capital of Tunisia, and Biles Elwadi, the sweet seller, is showing me how this national favourite is made. He rolls a sausage of the date and nut mixture into the semolina and cuts it into bite-size chunks to fry.It’s my final day in Tunisia and, as Biles packages 10 dinars’ (£2.55) worth for me to take home, I realise I don’t want to leave just yet.

    "description": "The Oddities Museum is a serial collector’s dream. This gallery of miscellany, loaded with outsider art and biological wonders of grotesque beauty, traveled as a U.S. roadshow at the Oddities and Curiosities Expo before attaining its official status as a non-profit museum on the outskirts of downtown Atlanta. Owner Jeremy Gibbs, who started his collection when he encountered the conjoined calves of the Georgia State capital on a junior high school trip, says, “The Oddities Museum is for the community, a place for folks to enjoy something out of the norm that pushes the envelope, where we are all allowed to be different from others, from our family, coworkers, and classmates. Here, we celebrate subculture, and those who will not immerse themselves can view from a distance, dip in their toes, and see something different for a moment in time.” Thousands of square feet are filled with strange treasures. Divided into sections like natural oddities, extreme art and pop culture relics, science and medical quackery, an asylum room, and a massive sideshow freak section are just the start. Giant clown heads and a kaleidoscope of funhouse objects hang from the rafters. Don’t miss the funeral section, where religion and fraternal orders bleed into the Victorian era. See how long it takes you to find the 20-foot-wide pterodactyl. The Oddities Museum has the most extensive collection of animal deformities on display in one building anywhere in the U.S., including a genuine jackalope and the only two-faced buffalo in existence. How about haunted dolls or an extensive collection of taxidermic pets that will make you shudder and sigh at the sweetness of the thought? For those who dare to believe in other worlds, don’t miss the full-sized mermaid in a glass casket or the “real” vampire in its coffin lying near a dead clown and an Egyptian mummy. Yeah, it's that kind of place. Visiting The Oddities Museum lets you come with your curiosity, ask questions, and leave with an expanded view of reality. See things you have never seen before and will probably never see again elsewhere.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/staro-zdanje",
    "description": "One of Serbia’s most stunning palaces is Staro Zdanje. Although it sits abandoned today, it was once regarded as one of the most beautiful structures in the Principality of Serbia and a fine example of Serbian architecture in the 1880s, which sought to combine traditional Serbian architecture with the Romantic style. Construction began in 1868 under the direction of the European-minded Prince Mihailo Obrenović, who elected Kosta Šrepović for the project. Blending the Serbian identity with European modernity resulted in a stunning ochre building with unique national features and decorative elements. Staro Zdanje, having been initially designed as the Assembly for the Principality of Serbia, transformed into a  summer residence for the Obrenović dynasty after the capital moved from Kragujevac to Belgrade. The side wings display distinctive windows in the national Serbian style, reminiscent of the sacral architecture of the Morava region. One of the building’s highlights is the Prince’s (or Duke’s) Hall, a magnificent ballroom that once featured a central chandelier adorned with numerous crystals, accompanied by four smaller chandeliers. The palace housed valuable art collections and elegant furniture. During the reigns of King Milan and his son King Aleksandar Obrenović, the hall was the site of extravagant balls. Notably, it was here that the young officer Živojin Mišić met his future wife, Lujza Nemica, at one such event. Following the May coup of 1903, Staro Zdanje lost its significance. In 1906, with the introduction of a railway connecting Belgrade to Aranđelovac, Staro Zdanje was for some time repurposed into a hotel. The courtyard of Staro Zdanje is now closed to the public, having fallen into disrepair due to neglect and vandalism. Former Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić had voiced plans to restore the palace. During a visit to Arandjelovac in late 2002, he expressed his desire to the then-Minister of Construction, Dragoslav Šumarac, to have the hotel ready to host delegations in 2004 for the 200th anniversary of Serbian statehood. Following his assassination in 2003, however, this has never been fulfilled, and the building now stands eerily in the Bukovička Banja Park next to the beautiful Hotel Šumadija, another abandoned building of significant cultural importance.",
