    "description": "My mother wrote about the meandering trails from the novelist’s cottage, through countryside loaded with literary references – now I’m following in her footstepsThe banks by the lane are white with snowdrops and a mistle thrush sings in the bare orchard. The writer Thomas Hardy grew up in the thatched cottage at the end of this track. His earliest poem, Domicilium, describes the house as it was in 1800 when his great-grandfather built it. The gardens were wilderness and the lane “a narrow path shut in by ferns”. This cottage, where Hardy wrote Far from the Madding Crowd, is the starting point for a 220-mile hike, the Hardy Way. I’ve walked round much of Dorset on this literary footpath, but I’m here now on a more personal pilgrimage.The last time I visited this cottage near Dorchester was with my mother, Kim Taplin, who died last year. This month, Dorset-based Little Toller publishes a new edition of her first book, The English Path. It’s about footpaths in English literature. Exploring the work of nearly 200 authors and artists, Kim shows the cultural importance of paths in connecting us to each other and to nature. Paths were crucial for work, love, worship and inspiration. “Without them,” she says, “Hardy could not have written, nor Constable painted, what he did.” Continue reading...",

    "description": "From sleek interior stores to modern perfumiers and quirky sex shops, the Danish capital has no shortage of unusual shopping opportunitiesInspired by Keith Haring’s Pop Shop, which the artist saw as a shop, art work and statement of practice in one, David Shrigley has had his little Shrig Shop in the French Quarter of Copenhagen since 2021, run with his longtime Danish gallery partner Nicolai Wallner. It’s a provocative art show, a gallery space, and a shop in one: the words To Hell With Everything are written in pink neon on the window and set the tone as you enter. Inside, it’s wall-to-wall irreverent prints, pin badges, T-shirts, bags and postcards, with images of ducklings and frogs, walruses, raccoons and rubbish bins.Tullinsgade 3 Continue reading...",

    "description": "Every day, hundreds, if not thousands, of visitors arrive via train, into central Edinburgh, via Waverly Station. Not knowing the layout of the city, these sightseers would be forgiven for mistaking the building that rises to the east as Edinburgh Castle. What they are actually looking at are the final remnants of Calton Jail and Bridewell Prison. The stone turret is all that is left of the former gruesome 19th century era correctional facility, known locally as the Governor's House. Whereas the retaining wall that runs beneath the adjacent St. Andrew's House, once belonged to the Georgian era prison. Robert Adam was the architect responsible for many buildings that reflected the ideals and concepts of the Age of Enlightenment in Edinburgh's New Town, this included the Bridewell Prison. However, it was Archibald Elliot who built the notorious Calton Jail (1817 - 1927) over the previous one. He also designed the nearby Regent Bridge. Both correctional facilities were constructed as an answer to the overcrowding and dismal conditions of the Old Town's nefarious Tollbooth Gaol. It is feasible to surmise that Calton Hill was chosen as a location as it was already a site for public executions. The newly constructed lockup offered scenic panoramic views of the city's skyline, including that of the aforementioned mistaken Edinburgh Castle. It was visiting novelist Jules Verne who is quoted as saying the jail as resembled a small-scale version of a medieval town. It wouldn't take long for the prison to earn a bad reputation as being the worst of the worst. Former inmate, Willie Gallacher described his confinement as follows; \"It was by far the worst prison in Scotland; cold, silent and repellent. Its discipline was extremely harsh, and the diet atrocious.\" The population of the institution  began to favor more women and children, as they were the ones without means to afford to pay for bail bonds. It wasn't just the interior that was unpleasant, as the outside served as a burial ground for executed criminals. As was customary, churches wouldn't allow for convicted felons to be buried in consecrated grounds. When St. Andrew's House, headquarters for the Scottish Government, was being constructed in the 1930's, the graves of 10 inmates were paved over. Thus making room for a parking lot. Several notable prisoners were held in the confines of this facility. These include the diabolical duo of 19th century serial killers William Burke and William Hare. Jessie King convicted of baby farming was the last women to be hanged in Edinburgh. The last person to be executed within the confines of the prison walls was the murderer Phillip Murray in 1923. The Governor's House, so named as it was home to the First Minister of Scotland, is not the only relic of this infamous institution that survives. The Beehive Inn pub in the city's Grassmarket area houses the Death Cell door.",

    "description": "A working pharmacy might seem like an unlikely place to find religious mosaics, but the counter at Farmacia del Puente in Santa Cruz de la Palma is home to several that would look right at home in a Byzantine cathedral. Since 1910, patrons have stopped by this spot nestled in La Palma not only to pick up medication, but also to admire the beautiful mosaics depicting the Saints Cosmas and Damian and their deeds. The connection between Saints Cosmas and Damian and the fields of pharmacy and medicine is deeply rooted in their legacy as compassionate healers. Renowned for their selfless dedication, they practiced medicine without charging a fee, earning them the title of anárgiros, or \"those without silver.\" Their lives exemplified an unwavering commitment to the physical and spiritual well-being of humanity, a legacy that continues to inspire modern healthcare professionals. Saints Cosmas and Damian are celebrated not only for their medical skills but also for their miraculous acts of healing. One of the most famous stories tells of how they successfully transplanted the leg from a corpse to a living patient suffering from gangrene. These supernatural accounts made them the patron saints of physicians, pharmacists, and surgeons, and their influence is felt wherever health and compassion intersect.",
