    "description": "A major new exhibition at the National Gallery puts the spotlight on the Tuscan town’s artistic heritage. But nothing beats exploring its historic neighbourhoods on footThis warren of narrow streets, some so tight that only the noon sunshine penetrates all the way down to the cobbles, is part gothic, part romanesque, and all beautiful. It’s blessed with an embarrassment of architectural riches and wrapped up in wonderfully preserved medieval walls that hug the city tightly, an enchantingly compact tangle of sandstone and terracotta perched on a hill overlooking a quintessentially Tuscan landscape of olive groves and vineyards and winding gravel roads. In any other corner of the world, Siena would be the only show in town.Around here though, there are several noisy neighbours. And none makes more of a racket than Florence, 50 miles north, famously the birthplace of the Renaissance and home of the Medici, Michelangelo, Giotto and Leonardo da Vinci. These days, it’s also famous for tourist tuk-tuks and newspaper stories about €25 ice-creams, as overtourism slowly erodes the city’s appeal. Which is why it’s better to avoid the roped-off processions of the Uffizi and choose Siena for an art lovers’ city break instead. (And for anyone who can’t make it to Chianti, the National Gallery in London will begin an extensive exhibition, Siena: The Rise of Painting, 1300-1350, in March. It will showcase the city’s importance to European art and its vital role as a catalyst of change.) Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/icherisheher-cat-house",
    "description": "Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, is a feline paradise not unlike Istanbul. There are stray cats everywhere, a cuddly symbol of the city. In the heart of its old town stands the grand Chain Building, part of which pays subtle homage to the local cat population. Easy to miss if you don't know it's there, the so-called Cat's House of Icherisheher is a work of art consisting of two faux windows and sandstone sculptures: one with a pair of children, a boy and a girl, looking up with a kitten, and another with a trio of cats. The names of this installation vary, but typically referred to as either the \"Monument to Lovers and Cats\" or Pişiklər və Uşaqlar (\"Cats and Children\"). Some locals and tour guides claim that there is a sad legend behind this artwork, a story about a strict judge who once lived at the house with his two children and cats. According to it, one day, a cat fell out of the window, and the judge punished his children by pushing them out of the window. For his cruelty, the judge was then cursed for eternity. The artwork, however, is simply a monument to Baku and its beloved cats. It was created by sculptor Tarverdi Guliyev in 1994, commissioned by Eldar Mikayilzade, a renowned carpet artist whose designs have also been featured on Azerbaijani manat banknotes.",

    "description": "Pere Lachaise Cemetery covers an impressive 110 acres. In this vast expanse one will find many monuments and memorials dedicated to both heroes and casualties of various conflicts. One such unsettling shrine, which can be found on the exterior wall that surrounds the burial ground, depicts men and women crying out in agony. The images of the slaughtered are rather ethereal, appearing as ghostly figures emerging from the stonewall. This commemoration goes by many names. The one that is most often cited is 'The Victims of Revolutions,' however, it is frequently misidentified as \"The Wall of the Fédérés\" or Communard's Wall. In the later part of the 19th century, nearly 150 political objectors, made up of both men and women, where lined up against this wall in the burial ground and massacred. These martyred activists, referred to as Communards, were resisting the forces of the Franco-Prussian War. Their unpretentious monument can be located in the south-eastern corner of the cemetery.  French sculptor Paul Moreau-Vauthier (1871 - 1936), who happens to be laid to rest inside the cemetery, repurposed the original bullet-ridden stones from the massacre. His depiction of the travesty also heavily emulates the events, with a woman standing in front to protect those behind from the ensuing gunfire. On the lower left-hand side is a quote from the French author and novelist Victor Hugo (1802 - 1885)\" \"What we ask of the future, what we want from it, is justice, not vengeance!\"",
