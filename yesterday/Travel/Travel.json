    "description": "A prototype electric snowmobile and old-school wooden skis open up Sweden’s backcountry as our writer goes on the hunt for local wildlifeOn the slopes up to the ridge, the snow is deep and fresh. Long frozen arms of it hug the trees. Behind us the tracks of our skis gleam with a strange blue light, and in front, delicately drawn into the snow, is the perfect feathery imprint of a bird – like a pale icy fossil. My guide, Jens Sarlin, from Next Step Nature, stops. “Capercaillie,” he says. “It was feeding on pine needles up top and has landed here, then dug a burrow in the snow. It may still be there.”We edge forwards. A trail of bird footprints lead to a hole, but it’s empty except for some droppings. “They dig down and then sideways to fool the foxes,” says Jens. We move forwards again, silent on our hunters’ skis, antique wooden heirlooms that slip easily over deep soft snow. What we are hunting, with cameras only, is something rarely seen – the wolverine – and Jens knows the best places to find them. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Memphis's Metal Museum is one of the few places in the world that focus exclusively on showcasing the art, craft, and history of metalwork. This unique collection, originally known as the National Ornamental Metal Museum, contains a wide variety of objects, from sculpture and jewelry to architectural pieces and home furnishings. There is an operational foundry and smithy on-site, where you can observe craftspeople at work and speak with employees about projects currently underway. Demonstrations of aluminum casting and blacksmithing are held every Saturday and Sunday afternoon. Studios at the museum also offer repair and restoration services for anything (except vehicles) made of metal, from gold bracelets to lawn furniture to lead statues.  Exhibitions of contemporary and historic metal artwork and jewelry rotate throughout the year, and portions of the Museum's permanent collection are on display as well. Since 1979, the museum has been located on the site of an old hospital, including the nurses' quarters (now art galleries and a store), officers' quarters, and an old administrative building that houses the permanent collection. There is an outdoor sculpture garden with a self-guided audio tour, and a view of the Mississippi river from a gazebo on the bluff. Workshops on welding, casting, blacksmithing, and enameling are offered on the weekends between September and May, and the museum often hosts events that often involve hands-on activities. The Metal Museum is planning to relocate to a larger space at the former Memphis College of Art in 2026.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zeitpyramide-wemding",
    "description": "Like most other German towns, Wemding is proud of its long history and heritage. Its old town is dominated by typical Bavarian architecture. But on its outskirts, you will find a rather austere modern sculpture, consisting of just four concrete blocks on an otherwise empty platform. While many may dismiss it, it holds a connection to the deep history of its town. In 1993, Wemding celebrated 1,200 years since its first written mention in a medieval land grant. To illustrate what such a long period of time means, local artist Manfred Laber devised the Zeitpyramide (\"time pyramid\"). It is to consist of 120 blocks in a step pyramid shape, with one placed every 10 years. And nobody alive today can hope to see it anywhere near complete, as even the first layer will not be finished until 2623. One may only view a model of the completed sculpture at the Kunstmuseum Donau-Ries in Wemding. So far four blocks have been placed, with the most recent laying in 2023 live-streamed and available on the Wemdinger Zeitpyramide Foundation's website. The next block is scheduled to be placed in 2033. However, due to a simple mathematical flaw called the picket fence error, it turns out the pyramid will not take 1,200 years to complete. Since the first block was laid in 1993 rather than 2003, the 120th block will be placed 10 years early in 3183. A YouTube channel called Stand-up Maths identified the error and proposed an alternative 121-block design that is not in a pyramidal shape. However, the Wemdinger Zeitpyramide Foundation seems content with Laber's original plan.",
