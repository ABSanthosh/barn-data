RodríguezPublished Dec. 2, 2024Updated Dec. 3, 2024, 12:37 p.m. ETEver daydream about vacationing alone on a tropical beach, where it’s just you, fluffy clouds and welcoming waves? That quiet relaxation is what I was looking for this fall on St. John, the smallest and wildest of the U.S. Virgin Islands. It has a reputation for being an off-the-beaten-path Caribbean gem. But I wasn’t sure what I’d find.For an island that is two-thirds national park, with more mongooses than humans, a lot has been in flux on St. John in recent years. Since 2017, to be exact. That’s when two terrifying hurricanes, Irma and Maria, slammed the island just 14 days apart. The devastated island was still recovering when the pandemic hit, and it seemed like the crippled economy was about to tank again. Instead, St. John boomed in popularity, thanks to loose entry requirements — remote workers came with their laptops and U.S. travelers showed up without their passports (For entry, U.S. citizens only need to show their driver’s license).ImageSt. John has a reputation for being an off-the-beaten-path Caribbean gem.ImageQuiet relaxation was what the author was looking for on this fall trip.Now, there is a sense of surging tourism momentum.
