One was accused of physically assaulting a flight attendant, but both were denied boarding, a lawsuit claims.An Asian woman says she was wrongly barred from reboarding a United flight and escorted from the airport because the staff mistook her for another Asian woman who had been on the flight.Credit...Gene J. Puskar/Associated PressJune 26, 2025In August, four female colleagues were flying from Las Vegas back home to Washington, D.C., after attending a real estate convention. It had already been a difficult travel day. First, their plane had been diverted because of weather to another airport, where they spent five hours stuck on the tarmac. During that delay, a colleague of theirs started experiencing chest pain.The day ended with all four women being escorted out of Baltimore Airport by armed police officers. They later filed a lawsuit against United Airlines alleging that the airline racially discriminated against its passengers.According to legal documents filed this month in federal court in Maryland, one of the plaintiffs, Jacquelyn Chiao, questioned a flight attendant who she said minimized the concerns about her colleague’s health and said he was “just having a panic attack.” Afterward, all passengers disembarked the plane. When they began reboarding later, Ms. Chiao’s colleague and fellow traveler, Christine Kim, was barred from boarding. The captain told Ms. Chiao’s colleagues that a flight attendant had reported she had been physically assaulted by a female Asian passenger, the complaint reads. Both Ms. Chiao and Ms. Kim are Asian American women of differing ethnicities.Ms. Kim said in a statement to The New York Times that she hadn’t had any interactions with the flight crew before being denied boarding. She had been reading a book on the flight, seated several rows back from Ms. Chiao. The experience left her feeling “hopeless and disgusted,” she added.In the end, Ms. Chiao, Ms. Kim and two other colleagues who questioned Ms. Kim’s removal were all denied boarding. In their joint lawsuit against United Airlines, the plaintiffs called the airline’s conduct “extreme and dangerous,” and said that they were falsely accused of “causing a disturbance” and that Ms. Kim was barred from the plane solely because of her race.Jim Brauchle, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said that Ms. Kim and Ms. Chiao “couldn’t be more different in appearance other than the fact that they’re Asian.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
