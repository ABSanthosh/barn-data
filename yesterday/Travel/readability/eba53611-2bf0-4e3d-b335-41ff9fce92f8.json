  "description": "Pont de Montiberri is a submerged historical bridge in the Alta Ribagorça region, near Pont de Suert in Catalonia, Spain. It is an excellent example of medieval architecture, with a single semicircular arch that used to span a narrow section of the river.  Built using local stone, the bridge blends seamlessly with the surrounding natural landscape. Pont de Montiberri is located between Riuet del Convent and the Pantà d'Escales reservoir. A small brook, Riuet del Convent takes its name from the convent whose ruins are still visible near Pont de Montiberri. A dam on the imposing Noguera Ribagorçana River created the Pantà d'Escales.  In addition to producing hydroelectricity, the dam also regulates the amount of water flowing in the Noguera Ribagorçana River, which means that the water level of Pantà d'Escales varies considerably.  When the water level is high, the bridge is almost completely submerged, and its semicircular arch can only be seen below the waterline. The exact date of Pont de Montiberri's construction is unknown, but it was probably built before or during the construction of the adjacent convent, the Abadia de Santa Maria de Lavaix, which was founded in the 9th century.  The technique, materials, and architecture of the bridge are also consistent with medieval Spanish architecture during the 9th century.  Today, only a few ruins remain of the Abadia de Santa Maria de Lavaix. The ruins are located on higher ground along the shores of Pantà d'Escales.",
