  "description": "Part art installation. Part super market. Part interdimensional portal. Visit Omega Mart for your next psychedelic-inspired shopping trip. On the first floor, check out, or even buy, products such as \"Corn P.M., a Soothing Nighttime Corn for Adults\" and \"Tattoo Chicken.\" While the shopping mall is an attraction in its own, it's more than just shelves of odd products. Explore secret rooms and art installations, and find a hidden bar within Omega Mart's walls.   Visitors can sign up to be employees, using assigned ID cards to follow a slew of clues and unravel the incredibly elaborate origin story of Omega Mart and Dramcorp, the company behind the storefront. Head up the stairs to explore Dramcorp headquarters, where the plot thickens. Watch out for hidden portals to other dimensions, or follow them down the rabbit hole.",
