  "description": "Tucked away beneath the breathtaking Linh Phước Temple in Da Lat — a kaleidoscope of mosaics made from tiny shards of glass and ceramic — lies something entirely unexpected: a creepy basement exhibit that plunges visitors into the terrifying legend of Mục Liên’s 18 Gates of Hell. Mục Liên, also known as Maudgalyāyana, is said in Buddhist scripture to have made multiple trips to hell, to rescue his mother from suffering.  Accessed through an unmarked stairway at the back of a souvenir shop beneath the temple, the descent into this underworld begins subtly—but quickly turns surreal. Inside, a dim, cavernous maze is lined with grotesque papier-mâché figures frozen in eternal torment, each tableau vividly portraying one of the Buddhist hells reserved for sinners of all kinds. Screaming souls, decaying demons, and grim-faced judges guide you through the moral allegory of karmic justice, all narrated by eerie audio echoing through the darkness in Vietnamese. This immersive exhibit is both kitsch and chilling, an offbeat spiritual warning nestled below one of Vietnam’s most beautiful temples. It’s a jarring contrast — and one you’ll never forget.",
