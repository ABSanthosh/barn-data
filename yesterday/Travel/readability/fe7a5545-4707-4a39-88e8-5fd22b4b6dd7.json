  "title": "Lenin’s Head, Tsinandali in Tsinandali, Georgia",
  "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lenins-head",
  "description": "In the small Georgian town of Tsinandali, tucked behind the elegant House Museum of Aleander Chavchavadze, where manicured gardens and wine cellars shine a light on Georgia’s aristocratic past, lies something far stranger — the partial remains of a statue of Vladimir Lenin. Notably, his head! What remains today is easy to miss, and seems strangely out of place. It’s a haunting fragment of history, hidden in plain sight. There are no plaques or signage explaining why the head was left behind. It simply lingers, almost like a secret the town doesn't like to talk about. Georgia likely had dozens of statues and busts of Lenin during the height of Soviet influence. Most are long gone. This is one of the last remnants of a bygone era.",
