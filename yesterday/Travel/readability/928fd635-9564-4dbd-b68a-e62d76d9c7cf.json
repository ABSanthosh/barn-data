In March, Mr. Abraham was arrested and charged by federal investigators with abusive sexual contact linked to three incidents of sexual assault on airplanes, including the one against Ms. Morgan. Mr. Abraham pleaded not guilty to all charges and a trial has been scheduled for Aug. 4. His attorney could not immediately be reached for comment.Last month, the F.B.I. reported that sexual assault on airplanes is on the rise, with 104 cases investigated by the bureau in 2024, up from 96 in 2023. The agency warned that the number of incidents could be higher as some cases may have gone unreported.“Sexual assaults typically occur on long commercial flights, and offenders tend to be male, seated directly next to the victim, and under the influence of alcohol or drugs,” the F.B.I. said in a statement published on its website last month. “They may try to conceal their activities, for instance, by using a blanket to cover the victim or taking advantage of a darkened cabin.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
