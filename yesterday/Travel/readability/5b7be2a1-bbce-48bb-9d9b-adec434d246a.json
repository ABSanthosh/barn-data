There are so many amazing sites here that you could spend days (heck, even weeks) just seeing the main, most well-known ones. But there’s more to Paris than the sites that attract thousands upon thousands of visitors each day. While I was living in Paris the past few months, I made it my mission to see some of the more unusual, lesser-known (but equally awesome) attractions (that didn’t come with the aggravating crowds that make so many of Paris’ attractions unbearable). And, while some of the things on the list below might not be “super secret” attractions or activities, they do fall into the category of “overlooked attractions” so I included them. Here are some of the best off-the-beaten-path things to see and do in Paris: Table of Contents1. Musée Édith Piaf2. Musée Curie3. Archives Nationales4. Librairie Galignani5. Paris Point Zero6. The Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy7. Petite Ceinture8. The Salvador Dalí Sundial9. Le Passe-Muraille10. Montmartre Cemetery11. The Museum of Counterfeiting12. Promenade Planteé (Coulée verte René-Dumont)13. Canal Saint-Martin14. Museé de MontmartreGet Your In-Depth Budget Guide to Paris!   1. Musée Édith Piaf Édith Piaf is perhaps the most famous French singer from the 1930s to the 1960s, and known around the world for her songs La vie en rose and Non, je ne regrette rien (which appeared in the movie Inception). She lived in a little apartment in the Ménilmontant district at the start of her career, which has been turned into a tiny museum dedicated to her. You get a glimpse at her life through her gold and platinum records, photographs, clothing, letters from fans, posters, recordings, and sheet music. Admission is free, but you’ll need to make an appointment. 2. Musée Curie Marie Curie was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize (and the only woman to win it twice) for her research into radioactivity (a word that she invented). She was the first female professor at the University of Paris as well as the first woman to be entombed in the Panthéon on her own merits. Located in the 5th arrondissement, this museum, in her old laboratory, highlights her radiological research. It’s insightful and eye-opening for anyone unfamiliar with her historic discoveries.   3. Archives Nationales Opened in 1867, the National Archives houses thousands of historical documents dating back to 625 CE. One of six national archives in the country, the museum sheds light on France’s turbulent past, providing nuanced historical details and context through permanent and temporary exhibitions. Built by the order of Napoleon I, the building itself (known as the Hôtel de Soubise) is absolutely stunning. It is in the late Baroque style, embracing long columns and lots of statues and sculptures. It features immaculate grounds and gardens as well. They always hold a lot of good exhibitions too.   4. Librairie Galignani This bookshop claims to be the oldest English bookstore in continental Europe, having opened in Paris in 1801. Prior to that, they were located in Venice and the Galignani name has been associated with publishing books since the 16th century. Age aside, this is a great place to browse as it is absolutely packed with books. You could easily spend a couple hours here hunting through the stacks and shelves. It’s a quiet, quaint shop and the staff are super knowledgeable. If you’re an avid reader like me, don’t miss it!   5. Paris Point Zero This is the official center of Paris, from which all distances in the city are measured. While it’s just a simple brass star set into the sidewalk near the Notre Dame Cathedral, there are a few popular rituals here that make this a short but fun stop (and since you’ll likely be nearby visiting the Cathedral, you might as well stop here). Some people treat the star as a wishing well, tossing a coin and making a wish (which is why there are usually a handful of coins on the star). Others, however, insist that if you stand on the star with your loved one and kiss, your love will last forever.   6. The Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy Opened in 1898, this gallery is a part of the French National Museum of Natural History. Taking up the ground floor of the building, it’s home to over 1,000 animal skeletons from around the world, including complete skeletons of elephants, large cats, and even dinosaurs. It’s as interesting as it is unsettling: all the animals are facing the same way, making it look like you’re in the midst of some undead stampede! Planning a trip to Europe?

Petite Ceinture In use from 1862 through 1964, the railway circling Paris was abandoned when the city expanded beyond its limits. It’s mostly hidden behind buildings and covered in wild plants and grass now, though some sections are now officially open to the public. You’ll find all sorts of flowers and street art along the tracks. While some sections are illegal to visit, near Parc Georges Brassens you’ll find a section of the tracks known as the ‘Passage de la Petite Ceinture’ that is both free and legal to visit. It’s located in the 15e arrondissement.   8. The Salvador Dalí Sundial This surrealist sundial was created by world-renowned artist Salvador Dalí. Located on Rue Saint-Jacques, it’s a mix of a human face and a scallop shell (the symbol of the Camino to Santiago, since the street is named after the saint). While the sundial doesn’t actually work, it’s nevertheless an easy way to see a piece of artwork by one of the most famous artists in the world.   9. Le Passe-Muraille This iconic bronze sculpture is located near Montmartre, making it an easy stop on your itinerary. It’s based on a character from The Man Who Walked Through Walls (Le Passe-Muraille), a short story by Parisian Marcel Aymé published in 1941. In the story, a man gains the ability to pass through walls and he uses the skill to get up to no good. At the end of the book, though, his power fades just as he is passing through a wall…and he gets stuck. If you get up close to the sculpture, you’ll see that the hands of the statue are extra smooth, thanks to countless people taking photos of themselves trying to pull the man free.   10. Montmartre Cemetery While the Père Lachaise Cemetery is the largest and most popular in Paris, for a more secluded stroll, check out the Montmartre Cemetery. Plenty of people visit the top of Montmartre for Sacré-Coeur and the view, but few take the time to wander this cemetery sitting at the foot of the district. It opened in 1825 and is home to many cobwebbed mausoleums, as well as a handful of stray cats. You won’t see many people here, so you can explore in peace.   11. The Museum of Counterfeiting Opened in 1972, this museum is home to counterfeit items that have been collected by France’s customs agents and police (as well as donated items from brands and consumers alike). There are over 500 items in the museum, ranging from counterfeit art and luxury goods to more mundane items, like cleaning supplies. While some knockoffs are impressive in their duplicity, it’s also funny to see just how bad some counterfeiters were!   12. Promenade Planteé (Coulée verte René-Dumont) This tree-lined walkway is a greenbelt that extends almost 5km along the old Vincennes railway line. The railway line ceased functioning in 1969, with the park being inaugurated a few decades afterward. Until New York built their High Line, it was the only elevated park in the entire world. (And, honestly, this is way nicer than the NYC High Line). You’ll find lots of trees, flowers, ponds, and places to sit along this long path that stretches from Bastille to the edge of Paris. It’s a long, easy, and beautiful walk. You won’t find many people here. Even on a nice day, it’s rather empty. It quickly became one of my favorite things to do in Paris and I can’t recommend coming here enough!   13. Canal Saint-Martin Stretching 4.5km, the Canal Saint-Martin is a man-made waterway commissioned by Napoleon. Construction finished in 1825, connecting the Canal de l’Ourcq to the Seine via both above-ground locks and underground tunnels. While not any secret spot (on a nice day, you’ll find the canal lined with people), it’s mostly a spot for locals who want to have a picnic and relax. So, say no to the Seine, and come have your outdoor picnic along the canal. It’s more relaxing and there will be fewer people!   14. Museé de Montmartre Founded in 1960, this museum is located throughout two buildings that date back to the 17th century. Over the years, the buildings were home to many famous writers and painters. The gardens of the museum were actually renovated to look more like the gardens in Renoir’s paintings (there is also a vineyard nearby that dates back to the Middle Ages but it makes horrible wine). The museum’s permanent collection includes a wide variety of paintings, posters, and drawings. *** While the main sights in Paris are always worth checking out, if you want to be more than a tourist and develop a greater appreciation for the City of Light’s unique and complex history, visit these unconventional and unusual attractions in Paris.   Get Your In-Depth Budget Guide to Paris!For more in-depth information, check out my guidebook to Paris written for budget travelers like you!

Located on Rue Saint-Jacques, it’s a mix of a human face and a scallop shell (the symbol of the Camino to Santiago, since the street is named after the saint). While the sundial doesn’t actually work, it’s nevertheless an easy way to see a piece of artwork by one of the most famous artists in the world.\u003cbr/\u003e\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan id=\"9-le-passe-muraille\"\u003e9.

It’s based on a character from \u003cem\u003eThe Man Who Walked Through Walls\u003c/em\u003e (Le Passe-Muraille), a short story by Parisian Marcel Aymé published in 1941. In the story, a man gains the ability to pass through walls and he uses the skill to get up to no good. At the end of the book, though, his power fades just as he is passing through a wall…and he gets stuck. If you get up close to the sculpture, you’ll see that the hands of the statue are extra smooth, thanks to countless people taking photos of themselves trying to pull the man free.\u003cbr/\u003e\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan id=\"10-montmartre-cemetery\"\u003e10.

Plenty of people visit the top of Montmartre for Sacré-Coeur and the view, but few take the time to wander this cemetery sitting at the foot of the district. It opened in 1825 and is home to many cobwebbed mausoleums, as well as a handful of stray cats.

There are over 500 items in the museum, ranging from counterfeit art and luxury goods to more mundane items, like cleaning supplies.
