  "description": "As a country landlocked by China and India, Nepal doesn't typically prompt thoughts of islands. And yet, Tal Barahi Temple is a two-story pagoda built on an island in Pokhara, India's Phewa Lake.  The temple is dedicated to the Hindu goddess Barahi. Barahi is known in Nepal as a manifestation of Durga, a major Hindu goddess, and Amija, a group of deities representing female ancestors.  Visitors can access the island by private boat or kayak. The island offers beautiful views of the Annapurna range and World Peace Pagoda on clear days.",
