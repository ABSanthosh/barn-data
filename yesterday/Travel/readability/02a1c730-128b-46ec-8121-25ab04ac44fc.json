On May 28, most passengers will start paying $35 for their first bag.Southwest’s new baggage fees are in line with other major U.S. airlines, which typically charge between $35 and $45 for a first checked bag.Credit...Erin Hooley/Associated PressMay 27, 2025, 12:05 p.m. ETSouthwest Airline’s longtime free luggage policy on basic economy fares will end on Wednesday when the airline begins charging a $35 fee for one checked bag and $45 for the second, according to a spokeswoman for Southwest.Until now, Southwest was the only major U.S. airline that allowed passengers to check two bags at no extra cost, but in March, the airline announced that it would start applying baggage fees to boost revenues and cut costs. The airline reported a net loss of $149 million in the first quarter.Under the new policy, customers flying Business Select or those with high loyalty status will be spared the additional fees; passengers with a Southwest Airlines co-branded credit card will be able to check one standard bag at no additional cost.Checked bag fees will apply to tickets booked on or after May 28 for Basic, Wanna Get Away Plus and Anytime fares. The baggage fees are in line with other major U.S. airlines, which typically charge between $35 and $45 for a first checked bag.In July, Southwest also announced that it will end its popular open seating policy, allowing passengers to choose their seats once they board an aircraft. Starting in early 2026, the airline will transition to assigned seating and begin offering premium seating at an additional cost.The Wall Street Journal first reported the new baggage fees on Tuesday.Follow New York Times Travel on Instagram and sign up for our Travel Dispatch newsletter to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.
