  "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ijssellinie",
  "description": "The IJssellinie is a fortification built to keep Russian forces out of the Netherlands during the Cold War. This fortification, built in secret around 1950, had the capability to close the Waal River at Nijmegen and the Nederrijn River at Arnhem with floating dams. If there was an attempted invasion, this would flood the Ijssel River and flood large portions of land. If this plan was activated, a large number of people and livestock would be at risk; thus, the need for secrecy.  Between Deventer and Olst, there are still about 30 bunkers left. About eight of these remaining bunkers are still  equipped as they were back in 1950. You can freely walk around the bunkers. At every bunker there are panels with explanations.",
