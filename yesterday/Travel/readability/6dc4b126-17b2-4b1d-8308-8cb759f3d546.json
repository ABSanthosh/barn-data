  "description": "In the center of Zagreb, step into a whimsical world of Croatian folklore. The Museum of Lost Tales is dedicated to little-known Croatian stories, myths, and legends. These traditional tales have been passed down from generation to generation, and have been memorialized in this space, through writing, illustrations, and interactive exhibits. The collection is the work of Croatian artist Zdenko Bašić, who has also illustrated children's books focused on the traditional tales. Opening its doors in 2024, Bašić created the museum to collect and record these stories — many of which are traditionally told orally — in writing and visual displays, for generations to come. Inside, you can find tales about faeries, witches, vampires, and other magical creatures that inhabit Croatian folktales. One room is dedicated to old Croatian and Slavic mythology, where you can read stories about the olden gods and other beliefs regarding the creation of the universe.",
