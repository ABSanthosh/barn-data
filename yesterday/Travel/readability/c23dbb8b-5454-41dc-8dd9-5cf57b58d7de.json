Here are some tips.Credit...Weston WeiDebra KaminDebra Kamin is frequent flier who has never paid full price for a first-class ticket.Updated Visions of champagne and lie-flat seats danced in my head when Azores Airlines accepted my 500-euro bid to upgrade my husband and me to business class during our kid-free vacation this past August.But the reality was far less cushy: Our seats reclined only a few inches more than regular coach seats. There was no screen for TV or movies. We ate exactly the same meal they served at the back of the plane. And that bubbly? A bust.There are more of us cabin climbers than ever, and many of us make the same rookie mistake I did, said Anthony Berklich, the founder of the luxury New York-based travel agency Inspired Citizen. Access to first and business class, once almost exclusively reserved for big spenders or as a perk for frequent fliers, is now open to a growing number of travelers willing to bid for an upgrade, spend loyalty points or shell out extra cash.Two decades ago, Delta Air Lines typically filled much of its first-class cabin with high-status frequent fliers. But now, more than 70 percent of seats are taken by eager customers who have paid for the privilege of sitting up front, both through paid upgrades and the purchase of a full-price fare, according to Glen Hauenstein, the president of Delta. Airlines are responding to this hunger by expanding first-class and business-class cabins — which in turn creates even more opportunities for upgrades.But choose wisely: Not all premium cabins pamper the same, and “if you don’t have the facts, you absolutely can be robbed,” Mr. Berklich said.Here are some tips for making your lie-flat dreams come true.Research the routesThe quality — and extravagance — of your first-class experience is going to depend on where you’re flying to and from.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
