  "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/taiwan-stock-musuem",
  "description": "Hidden inside an unassuming office building in Taipei, the Taiwan Stock Museum sits within a former high-security vault, a fitting home for a collection that preserves Taiwan’s financial history. Unlike conventional museums, this space provides an in-depth look at stock certificates, securities trading, and the evolution of Taiwan’s stock market. The museum’s collection includes a range of historically significant stock certificates, from the earliest paper stocks issued in Taiwan to the highest face-value stock certificate ever printed—a Chunghwa Telecom share worth NT$281 billion. These artifacts illustrate the development of Taiwan’s economy and the transition from physical stock certificates to fully digital transactions. Beyond stock memorabilia, the museum serves as an educational resource for student groups and financial enthusiasts. Exhibits include interactive displays on Taiwan’s securities depository process that explain how shares are stored, transferred, and safeguarded. Visitors can also test their knowledge about the stock market through interactive games. Despite its compact size, the Taiwan Stock Museum presents a compelling narrative of Taiwan’s financial history and economic development. The Taiwan Stock Exchange was established in 1961, when Taiwan’s GDP per capita was less than $200. Today, Taiwan’s GDP per capita exceeds $30,000, and its stock market sometimes ranks among the top ten in the world by market value. The museum requires reservations, so plan ahead before visiting.",
