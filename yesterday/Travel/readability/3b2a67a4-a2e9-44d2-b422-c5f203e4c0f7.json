  "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dauer-museum-of-classic-cars",
  "description": "This museum is not just a collection of over 55 classic cars, but a meticulously curated journey through American and global automotive history, spanning from 1906 to 2020. Visitors can expect to see everything from a 1906 Cadillac delivery truck to rare gems like a 1953 Oldsmobile Fiesta (one of only 458 ever made), a 1953 Buick Skylark, and a 1956 Cadillac Eldorado once owned by Marilyn Monroe. The oldest vehicle is a 1906 Cadillac delivery truck. The cars are restored to original specs, and driven to special events. Many have won awards at antique car shows. Each car has an informative plaque that provided historical context, production numbers, and technical details. The museum  recreates entire scenes from the past, such as a 1934 Texaco gas station with original pumps and products, a drive-in movie theater, and a Hollywood premiere backdrop with luxury cars and vintage film cameras.",
