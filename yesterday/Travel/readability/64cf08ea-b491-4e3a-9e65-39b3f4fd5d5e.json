  "description": "Model ship making is an art almost as old as that of making regular-sized ships, as these models were often used to convince admirals and other investors into building the real deal. While most of the large ships have sunk now, many of the models can still be found across the world. However, the art has not died out and several places in the world still make these models. The Model Shipyard is one such a place. Hailing from a unsuspecting office building in Mossel Bay, the Model Shipyard is an interesting mix between museum and place of work. The setup is done in such a way that guests can come by and take a look at the process as well as see pictures of past ships that were made by the company. You won't find many ships on display, as they all go to their new owners once complete. But there is always one or two in the making.",
