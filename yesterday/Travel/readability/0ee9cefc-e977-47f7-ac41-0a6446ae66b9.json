  "description": "Tucked away in the streets of Can Tho, Vietnam, the Bảo Tàng Tarot (Museum of Tarot) offers a fascinating collection of divination memorabilia spanning centuries of fortune-telling. Founded in 2016 and officially opened in 2017, the museum is housed in the “citron house,” a beautifully preserved building built in the Vietnamese Renaissance style, donated by an elderly couple in 2015. With over 2,000 artifacts, the museum presents a unique journey through three core themes. Lithotherapy, features healing crystals. Cartomancy is the practice of using cards to tell the future. Demonology is the study of demons and evil. Its six main collections include tarot and oracle decks, historical documents on cartomancy, the art of card making, magical talismans, lithotherapy crystals, and haunted objects tied to supernatural lore. Among these treasures, visitors will find everything from centuries-old divination cards to modern-day Pokémon and Harry Potter Tarot decks, offering a whimsical twist on the world of tarot. Whether you're exploring ancient decks, admiring the intricate craftsmanship of card design, or browsing books on demonology, the museum offers a unique blend of history, magic, and mystery. And for those seeking a more personal experience, the museum also offers individual tarot readings.",
