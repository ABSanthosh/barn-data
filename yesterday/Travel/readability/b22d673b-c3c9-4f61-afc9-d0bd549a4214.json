  "description": "On August 21, 1937, Philippine President Manuel Quezon issued Proclamation No. 173, initiating an open-door policy for the country so that it could receive persecuted Jews fleeing Europe. Under this program, the local Jewish community in the Philippines assumed responsibility for the refugees, ensuring they would not burden the local community. The same year, the Jewish Refugee Committee (JRC) was established. The program was selective; only refugees with ‘desirable’ professions such as doctors and scientists, along with their families, were prioritized and eventually granted visas. From 1938 on, the Philippines welcomed over 1,300 Jews from Germany and Austria. President Quezon even used his residence, Marikina Hall, to receive refugees. This proclamation later became the basis of Commonwealth Act 613, later known as the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940. Thousands more refugees could have been rescued has the United States government not imposed a limit of 1,000 Jews per year over a 10-year period. The Philippines continued to receive Jewish refugees until December 8, 1941, when Japan attacked the country. These refugees, who came to be known as ‘Manilaners,’ stayed until after the war before relocating to the United States. President Quezon safeguarded the documents related to the special immigration program, including travel documents and refugee passports, in a special vault at his home. He was the only person who was authorized to access it. His house, along with the vault, was relocated to the Quezon City Memorial Circle. The vault is now placed in a ground-floor room previously used by Aurora Quezon, the President’s wife, in her later years. In 2015, the Quezon Heritage House was designated as a Local Heritage Site by the Quezon City government.",
