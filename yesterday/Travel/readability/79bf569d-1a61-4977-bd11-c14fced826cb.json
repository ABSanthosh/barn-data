What you need to know.Flight attendants and travelers arrive from overseas at Kennedy Airport. The State Department has issued a travel advisory for Americans going abroad.Credit...Anna Watts for The New York TimesJune 23, 2025, 12:46 p.m. ETThe State Department issued a worldwide security alert on Sunday, urging Americans abroad to “exercise increased caution” because of the potential for “demonstrations against U.S. citizens and interests abroad,” after American intervention in the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran.The advisory came a day after President Trump announced that U.S. forces had attacked nuclear sites in Iran, a move that experts say is likely to draw retaliation against American military assets in the region.Here’s what you need to know if you are overseas or considering international travel.What does the advisory mean?The worldwide security alert calls on Americans to be cautious and vigilant when traveling abroad. It also warns that the conflict between Iran and Israel has resulted in “disruptions to travel and periodic closure of airspace across the Middle East.”The advisory urges Americans to read country-specific advisories and security alerts when planning travel and to sign up for the government’s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program for real-time security updates and to help the State Department quickly and accurately establish contact in the event of an emergency.Is it safe to travel?It depends on where you are going. The State Department’s country-specific guidance has both Israel and Iran at Level 4, or “do not travel.” The travel advisory for Israel, the West Bank and Gaza was updated on June 16 citing “armed conflict, terrorism and civil unrest.” Emergency evacuation flights are being provided for Americans wishing to leave Israel.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
