  "description": "Casa Cueva, or “Cave House,” was designed by the Mexican architect Juan O’Gorman as his family home, built on a lava bed in the Jardines del Pedregal neighborhood of Mexico City. In 1969, it was acquired and transformed by the artist Helen Escobedo, who demolished parts of it to build her residence, sparking a longstanding controversy that remains a subject of heated discourse in local architectural and artistic circles. The building is now a music school without public access, but parts of the original structure remain, including a rocky facade with O’Gorman's original multicolored mosaics.",
