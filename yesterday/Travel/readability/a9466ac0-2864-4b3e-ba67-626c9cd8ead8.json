  "description": "Northern Taiwan once had a thriving coal industry, but it declined due to low-quality deposits, mine collapses, and international competition. By 2000, the last mine closed. Today, much of this history has faded from public memory, though traces remain across the landscape. Just two kilometers from Taipei 101, once the tallest building in the world, lies Hexing Coal Mine, one of many abandoned mines in the region. The Taipei City government has turned this site into a small historical park to preserve its legacy.  The site, more of a mini-museum, takes about 5 to 10 minutes to explore. It includes two main areas: the track section and the mine entrance. The track section contain a status of a miner pushing a cart and a mural depicting the coal production process. By the entrance, a charming statue of a pangolin holding mining tools offers a whimsical nod to the mine’s history. A short path leading into the mine houses simple exhibits on coal mining culture and history.",
