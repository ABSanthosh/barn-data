  "description": "Charles Addams studied architecture at the University of Pennsylvania in the 1930s. In 2001, the building at 200 S. 36th Street was dedicated to him and now houses the University's Fine Arts Department. Outside the building, there are silhouettes of all eight Addams Family members, created by Lindsay Falck from the School of Design. Originally in the Addams courtyard, they were later moved to the corner of 36th and Walnut. The Kelly Family Gates outside the Charles Addams Fine Arts Hall, designed by Mark Leuders in 2003, also honor Charles Addams with fifty-six bronze hands engaged in various artistic activities inspired by Thing T. Thing.",
