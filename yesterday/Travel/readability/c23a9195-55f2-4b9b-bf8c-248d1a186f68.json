  "description": "On July 9, 1864 as the 9:50 p.m. train from Fenchurch Street pulled into Hackney station at 10:11 pm, two bank clerks entered a first-class carriage and discovered it awash in blood—the scene of the world's first murder on a railway. Though neither the attacker nor the victim were present at the scene, the victim was discovered shortly after, unconscious and severely injured by the tracks between Hackney Wick and Bow Stations. Thomas Briggs, a nearly 70-year-old bank clerk, had boarded the train at Fenchurch Street, and during his journey fell victim to a brutal assault and robbery that left him mortally wounded.  Though Briggs’ gold watch and chain were missing, indicating a motive of robbery, the bloody carriage contained Briggs’ bag and stick and a single clue: a black beaver hat. This hat was recognized as belonging to Franz Muller by an acquaintance who also shared a photo of Muller. Soon after, a jeweler came forward with a description of a German man who matched the photo and had recently exchanged a gold chain—a chain later identified as belonging to Briggs. A warrant was immediately issued for Muller's arrest.  Though Muller had fled to New York, detectives followed, reaching the city three weeks ahead of Muller, who had taken a slower ship. Muller was apprehended, Briggs' watch in his possession, and extradited to England, where he was found guilty and publicly executed. Today, at 129 Cadogan Terrace in East London, a blue plaque remembers this dark chapter in railway history. The plaque marks the location of what was, at the time, the Mitford Castle pub, where the mortally wounded Briggs was carried after the attack.",
