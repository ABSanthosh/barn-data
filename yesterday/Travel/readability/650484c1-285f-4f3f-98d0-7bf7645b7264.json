New trains as well as new routes, amenities and special events are rolling out, enticing travelers to sit back, Champagne in hand, and glide through some of the world’s most beautiful landscapes. Be it the Lake District in England or the mountainous island of Kyushu in Japan, these journeys offer suites that rival rooms in high-end hotels, and dishes from chefs whose restaurants have won Michelin stars. Here’s where to climb aboard.Paris to Tuscany and Paris to PortofinoThe Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, a Belmond Train, EuropeImageThis spring, the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, a Belmond Train, Europe, will take passengers from Paris to Italy. The train’s restored carriages date to the 1920s and ’30s.Credit...Christophe CoenanBeginning in May, this opulent train, with its restored 1920s and ’30s carriages, will offer a new, three-night journey called Paris to Tuscany by a Legend of the Rails. Step into Bar Car 3674 to enjoy live piano music before retiring to your jewel-toned room. Options include a “historic cabin” with seats that convert to berths (communal restrooms are at the end of each sleeper carriage); a suite with its own marble bathroom and a double or twin bed that converts to a seating area; or a grand suite with a marble bathroom, double bed, dining area and 24-hour butler service.During your travels, you’ll visit Siena, Italy, where you’ll tour the Gothic-style historic center. You’ll stop by a 13th-century palace in the Piazza del Campo where you can savor an aperitif while taking in panoramic views of the city, and spend two nights amid vineyards and olive groves at Castello di Casole, a Belmond Hotel, Tuscany. While there, stroll the grounds, join a stargazing session at the outdoor amphitheater and unwind with live music in the courtyard. Prices (including meals with wine) are from 9,350 pounds, or about $12,100 a person, based on two guests sharing a historic cabin and two nights in a junior suite at Castello di Casole.In June, the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express will begin traveling to Portofino from Paris again (last year was its inaugural journey), this time with an added carriage: the L’Observatoire sleeper carriage, designed by the French artist, JR. The train’s largest accommodation will have its own library with more than 1,000 books, a tearoom with a fireplace, even a skylight so you can watch the clouds as the train moves along. The trip concludes at Splendido, a Belmond Hotel, which, beginning in June, will unveil renovations and updates to communal spaces, including a breakfast area, cocktail bar and Dior spa. Prices (which include meals and wine) for Paris to Portofino are from £10,400 a person, based on two guests sharing a historic cabin and two nights in a premium room at Splendido.ItalyLa Dolce Vita Orient ExpressImageBeginning this spring, La Dolce Vita Orient Express will depart from Rome for round-trip itineraries that visit various parts of Italy.
