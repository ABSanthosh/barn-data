  "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pinecone",
  "description": "Portland, Maine, is a quirky city known for its lobster, beer, and sprawling art scene. Eagle-eyed dwellers may notice murals, art installations and sculptures can be found scattered about, including a curious, oversized metal structure in the middle of the popular Deering Oaks Park. This sculpture depicts Maine's state flower: a white pine cone. It was crafted from repurposed steel shovels by Maine artist Patrick Plourde, and donated to the public art permanent collection in tribute to Alice Spencer, founder of TEMPOArt—a local entity that supports temporary and permanent art installations throughout the city. Pinecone serves to recognize Alice's contributions in establishing Portland as a city rich in public art.",
