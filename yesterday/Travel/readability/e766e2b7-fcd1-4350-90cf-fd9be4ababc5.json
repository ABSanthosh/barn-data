  "description": "The hit television series \"Diriliş: Ertuğrul,\" (2014) and its sequel \"Kuruluş: Osman,\" (2019) are two of the most popular shows to come out of Turkey. The first is based on the life of historical figure Ertuğrul and the sequel tells the story of his son Osman I, who is credited with founding the Ottoman Empire. Both series were created by Mehmet Bozdağ, founder of Bozdağ Film, and the production company has now opened the elaborate sets in the Turkish village of Riva to visitors. The sets mirror the history traced in the shows, taking visitors back in time to travel from Central Asia, with structures reminiscent of caravanserai (the Ottoman equivalent of a modern day roadside motel or rest stop), to Thrace and Anatolia, then part of the Byzantine Empire that would become modern-day Turkey. Recreations of Mongol-style yurts, a Roman arena and others give a sense of the diversity found from the Balkans to the Gobi during the 13th century lives of these two historical figures. The shows have not been without controversy. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has praised the series for reviving national pride, but critics—particularly in Arab-majority nations—have accused the shows of glorifying Ottoman imperialism. Egypt and Saudi Arabia banned the shows, even issuing religious rulings (fatwas) against them. Meanwhile, in countries like Pakistan, they’ve enjoyed a massive following, with former Prime Minister Imran Khan urging citizens to watch. Given the huge international following of the series, the Bozdağ sets have evolved into a permanent tourist attraction. They offer guided tours in addition to period-appropriate activities like horseback riding and archery.",
