Here are some tips to get a fair deal, and maybe even make a new friend.Credit...Weston WeiApril 18, 2025When you buy something at your local supermarket, you generally pay the price on the tag — easy. But in places like Turkey, Vietnam, Egypt, Morocco, Peru, China and West Africa, prices are not always set in advance. You may find yourself haggling over the cost of souvenirs, produce, taxi rides and more.It’s normal to feel awkward, maybe a bit anxious, over an unfamiliar practice. Are you overpaying? Are you driving too hard of a bargain? Is this even something a conscientious traveler should do? And if so, where do you begin?Here are some tips for negotiating a price that leaves everyone feeling good.Be bold, but respectfulBefore you go shopping, ask hotel staff or a local guide whether haggling is normal in your destination and about fair prices for key items on your wish list. Or just watch local buyers, then mirror their bargaining approach and how much they pay. Haggling is most common in outdoor markets, bazaars and tourist districts, said Ozcan Kaya, 27, who has sold carpets for a decade in his family’s shop in Istanbul.Then, once you hit the market, don’t be shy: Merchants will expect you to negotiate, and it’s not impolite to do so, especially if you learn a few bargaining phrases in the local language.Remember that in a fair deal, both sides win. The seller should make some money, and you should not wind up feeling fleeced.Jill Moser, 49, a jewelry artisan and frequent traveler from Fort Worth, said she works hard to strike the right balance.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
