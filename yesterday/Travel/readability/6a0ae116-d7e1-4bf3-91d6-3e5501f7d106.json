Here’s How to Use a Credit Card to Get Around Them.We asked travel and credit card experts how to maximize value and save money when it comes to pesky luggage add-ons. Here’s what you need to know.With all the major U.S. airlines now charging for checked luggage, consumers looking for ways to save can turn to credit cards that offer travel perks.Credit...Erin Hooley/Associated PressJuly 11, 2025Southwest Airlines was the last big holdout. When the carrier ended its free checked-bag policy in May, it joined the other major U.S. carriers — and most airline passengers began paying at least $35 for their first checked bag.Of course, there are ways around the fees: You can spend enough with an airline to earn a loyalty status that includes a waiver, upgrade your fare to include baggage, or pack light enough to need only a carry-on. And then there’s the option recommended by most travel enthusiasts: a credit card that comes with perks.Typically, travelers have two options: a general credit card used to earn rewards in various categories, including travel, or an airline-specific credit card.Here’s what to know about rewards cards and how they can help offset the cost of checked baggage fees.Option 1: General travel credit cardsThe biggest utility of a general credit card, which allows customers to accumulate points that they can redeem for discounts on travel, is flexibility. Cardholders, particularly ones looking for a deal, are not beholden to a particular airline to find the most efficient or cost-effective routes. Customers can also use general rewards cards to earn points at grocery stores, gas stations and other eligible partners.“If your goal is to earn more valuable rewards that you could use toward free flights down the line and other travel, you’re better off with a general travel rewards card just because those rewards are a lot more flexible,” said Benji Stawski, the content director of the Daily Drop, a travel newsletter.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
