  "description": "Hibiya Godzilla Square is home to the largest Godzilla statue in the country, a monumental tribute to Japan’s most famous kaiju (“strange beast” or “monster”). The impressive tribute to the iconic character contains the original screenplay for Godzilla's 1954 debut. Despite the area around Hibiya Godzilla Square being destroyed in the original film and many subsequent installments, the square has proudly housed a statue of the treasured titan since 1995. Two statues have occupied the square over this time, the first of which was installed to commemorate Godzilla’s demise in Godzilla vs. Destoroyah. The present statue replaced it in 2018. An unmistakable representation of Godzilla as seen in the 2016 film Shin Godzilla, the centerpiece of Hibiya Godzilla Square rises above a crashing wave at an impressive height of 9.8 feet, making this towering terror the tallest full statue of Godzilla in Japan.",
