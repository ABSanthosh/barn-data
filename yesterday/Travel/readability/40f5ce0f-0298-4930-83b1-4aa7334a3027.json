Juneau Votes Against Limiting Large Cruise Ships.Some residents in the Alaskan capital, frustrated with cruise crowds, sought to limit ship traffic on Saturdays, despite the likely negative impact on local businesses.Passengers stream off a cruise ship in Juneau, Alaska. Residents recently voted on a measure that would ban large ships on Saturdays.Credit...Becky Bohrer/Associated PressOct. 16, 2024, 9:18 a.m. ETFrom Venice and Amsterdam to Maine and Key West, popular tourist destinations are taking a hard look at cruise ship traffic and the crowds and environmental pressures they generate.Among the most recent destinations to consider limiting that traffic is Juneau, Alaska, which has a population of 32,000 and received 1.65 million cruise ship visitors last year. Yesterday, the city released the final results of a recent vote over whether cruise ships should be banned on Saturdays: The proposal was rejected.Out of the 28,113 residents eligible to vote, 10,880 had voted, with 4,196 in favor of the initiative called “Ship-Free Saturdays” and 6,575 against.Juneau — the capital of Alaska and the entrance point to the Mendenhall Glacier, a favorite cruise ship excursion — sees as many as 20,000 cruise passengers per day during the high season, which runs from April to October. The initiative was devised to ease overcrowding, but residents and officials who were against the measure cited concerns about the expected negative impact on local businesses.“The ship pollution and excessive visitor traffic is very real, but banning them for an entire day is not the answer,” said Laura Murray, a resident who voted against the measure. “We need to find a better solution, introducing measures that will protect our environment without hurting the local economy.”Last year, on Saturdays alone, the cruise industry generated $3.7 million in cruise-related fees and taxes for Juneau, and passengers spent $30 million at local businesses, according to the city government. Protect Juneau’s Future, a coalition of local businesses, travel agents and cruise operators opposed to the initiative, raised more than $350,000 to campaign against it.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
