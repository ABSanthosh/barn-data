  "description": "Towering over the streets of Basel, Switzerland, Hammering Man is a mechanical sculpture that captures the beauty of labor in perpetual motion. Designed by American artist Jonathan Borofsky, this 42-foot (13-meter) kinetic artwork swings its hammer tirelessly, a poetic ode to workers and artisans worldwide. Installed in 1989, this sleek and minimalist figure is part of Borofsky’s global Hammering Man series, which includes similar sculptures in Seoul, Frankfurt, and Seattle. Each iteration has unique dimensions and context, but all share a common purpose: to celebrate the dignity of work and the human spirit’s ceaseless drive to create. In a fun twist, Hammering Man doesn’t work 24/7. The sculpture “rests” at night and on Swiss Labor Day (May 1), when its hammer stops swinging—a respectful nod to the workers it honors.",
