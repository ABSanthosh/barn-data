  "description": "Continually occupied from prehistory until today, the site of Flag Fen in the United Kingdom is home to a wide range of evidence and artifacts from different eras.  Most important is perhaps the preserved remains of the Fen Causeway, an ancient road through the Fens where many people would have convened. Raised above the then-undrained bog, the causeway was a massive timber construction from different species of trees. These peaty conditions are what lead to the quality of the road's preservation and its increased importance as a Neolithic site.  The museum is also home to a handful of reconstructions of Bronze Age roundhouses that housed the Britons who used the Causeway, allowing visitors to fully immerse themselves in what life was like thousands of years ago.",
