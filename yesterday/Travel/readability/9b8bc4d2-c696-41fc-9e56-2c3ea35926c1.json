After over 17 years of traveling the world, I still never leave home without it. Why? Because I’ve seen firsthand how useful it can be — and how much money it can save. I’ve lost baggage, had my camera broken, and even needed emergency medical help over the years. Travel insurance has been there for me each time. Not only has it saved me money but it’s provided me with peace of mind as I explore. I’ve written extensively over the years about why you need insurance, how to pick the right company, and listed my preferred providers. Today, I want to talk about my favorite travel insurance company: SafetyWing. Table of ContentsWho is SafetyWing?What Does SafetyWing Cover?What’s Not Covered?Nomad Complete: Coverage for Digital Nomads and Long-Term TravelersMaking a ClaimA Note About COVIDPros and Cons of SafetyWingWho is SafetyWing Good — and Not Good For?   Who is SafetyWing? SafetyWing is an insurance company that focuses on affordable coverage for budget travelers and digital nomads (though you don’t have to be either to get coverage). It is run by nomads and expats who know exactly what such travelers need. SafetyWing offers basic insurance plans (called “Nomad Essential”) for a fraction of what other companies charge, although they are also less comprehensive. To me, they are the best overall travel insurance company out there. Their standard Nomad Insurance coverage costs just $56.28 USD for 4 weeks (for travelers aged 10-39). That’s one of the lowest prices out there for reliable travel insurance. They are super competitive when it comes to price. Their coverage extends all the way to age 69, however, travelers aged 60-69 should expect to pay upwards of $196 USD per month for coverage. Still very reasonable, to be honest. But is the coverage actually good? What about the customer service? Today I want to review Safety Wing and talk about when it is — and isn’t — worth using so you can better prepare for your next trip and ensure you have the coverage you need.   What Does SafetyWing Cover? SafetyWing’s standard Nomad Insurance plan is the Essential plan. It’s just $56.28 USD for four weeks of travel (outside the US). That works out to just $1.87 USD per day! For travelers under age 64, that plan includes the following: $250,000 USD in emergency medical coverage $1,000 USD for emergency dental care $100,000 USD for medical evacuation ($25,000 USD if the cause of medical evacuation is acute onset of pre-existing condition) $10,000 USD for an evacuation due to political upheaval $5,000 USD for a trip interruption Up to $100 a day after a 12-hour delay period requiring an unplanned overnight stay. Subject to a maximum of 2 days. $12,500–25,000 USD for death or dismemberment $20,000 USD for repatriation of remains Be sure to check the description of coverage for any conditions that apply. Its $100,000 USD for medical evacuation is on the low end, but unless you’re heading out into the remote wilderness, that should be fine. (If you want higher coverage, get MedJet.) Its travel-delay payout is pretty low, but airlines and most travel credit cards provide travel delay assistance too so you might not even need the coverage offered by SafetyWing. Additionally, it doesn’t really cover expensive electronics, which sucks if you have a pricey camera or video gear. As with most standard travel insurance plans, this one doesn’t include pre-existing conditions or certain adventure sports, so it’s not a good policy if you’re going to do a lot of adventure activities on the road. They do offer a couple helpful add-ons that I think a lot of travelers will appreciate, including coverage for adventure activities and electronics theft. That means that if you need the coverage, you can pay extra for it. However, if you don’t need it then you don’t have to pay for it, keeping your costs low. I appreciate that, as someone who always needs electronic coverage but who never needs adventure activity coverage (I’m not a big adrenaline junkie).   What’s Not Covered? The Essential plan is primarily geared towards covering medical emergencies and basic travel mishaps (like delays and lost luggage). Here are some things that aren’t covered: Alcohol- or drug-related incidents. Extreme sports \u0026 adventure activities (unless you purchase the adventure sports add-on, which is available for non-US residents) Pre-existing conditions or general check-ups Trip cancellation Lost or stolen cash Nomad Complete: Coverage for Digital Nomads and Long-Term Travelers In 2023, SafetyWing launched Nomad Health (now called their “Complete” plan). It’s insurance for digital nomads, remote workers, and long-term travelers. This new plan offers a mix of the standard emergency coverage that we’ve been discussing above along with “regular” health care coverage, such as routine visits and preventive care. The Complete plan also offers coverage in 175 countries, includes wellness benefits, mental health care, and the ability for individuals to choose their own doctor while traveling. They will be expanding coverage too, including an add-on for “electronics theft” (which, as someone who has been robbed while traveling, I think is a great idea). It’s like the kind of health insurance you’d find in your home country, ensuring that you’re looked after no matter what happens while you’re abroad. You can learn more and compare the plans here. If you’re just heading out for a couple weeks or a couple months, SafetyWing’s Essential plan is the option for you. It’s perfect for emergencies, is super affordable, and is designed for budget travelers. It’s the plan I use when I travel these days. However, if you’re going to be working abroad or traveling for months (or years), then their new Complete plan is the better option. It offers much more coverage while still being affordable. In fact, it’s the plan I wish I had when I started traveling long-term! You can learn more about the Complete plan in my dedicated review. Making a Claim SafetyWing makes it easy to file a claim through their online portal. You just upload all the required documents, screenshots, and photos, and wait to hear back. While claims can take up to 45 business days, most are handled in less than a week (as of writing, the average wait time is four days). If you read the reviews online, most people who had a negative experience either didn’t know about the deductible (SafetyWing removed their deductible for non-US residents as of 2024) or hated the length of time it took to get paid. But that’s pretty normal for people to complain about. On the plus side, SafetyWing’s average time to handle a claim is down to just four days. That’s way faster than most companies!   A Note About COVID SafetyWing does include coverage for COVID-19. As long as the virus was not contracted before your plan starts, then it will be covered (as long as it is medically necessary). SafetyWing also covers quarantine costs (outside your home country) for up to $50 USD/day for 10 days (provided that you’ve had your plan for at least 28 days).   Pros and Cons of SafetyWing Here’s a look that the pros and cons of SafetyWing at a glance to help you decide if it’s the best insurance provider for you and your trip: Most affordable travel insurance out there Only covers up to age 69 Offers coverage for COVID-19 Limited coverage for gear/electronics You can buy plans online even if you’re already on your trip Limited coverage for adventure activities Easy to submit claims online No trip cancellation coverage After being abroad for 90 days, you keep your medical coverage for 30 days in your home country (15 days if you’re from the U.S.) Up to 2 children under 10 per family (1 per adult) can be included for free No need to set an end date (subscription renews every 4 weeks) Two different plans mean you can easily find one that works for you/your budget Who is SafetyWing Good — and Not Good For? SafetyWing is designed as mainly medical coverage. Since SafetyWing is designed for the budget-conscious digital nomad, it doesn’t cover some areas that might be more of a priority for a shorter-term traveler. Here’s a quick chart to help you decide if SafetyWing is right for you: Budget travelers People traveling with a TON of electronics Someone looking for simple emergency coverage Anyone needing comprehensive trip delay or cancellation People without lots of expensive electronics People doing excessive extreme sports/activities Digital nomads who need medical coverage for long-term travel *** Travel insurance is something I never leave home without. I know it’s a boring topic to read about and research, but it can literally save you hundreds or thousands of dollars in bills! I never, ever leave home without it. You shouldn’t either. So, the next time you’re on the road, consider SafetyWing. To me, they are the best travel insurance company out there for budget travelers. You can use the booking widget below to get a quote (it’s free): Book Your Trip: Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner. It’s my favorite search engine because it searches websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is being left unturned.

If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use Booking.com as it consistently returns the cheapest rates for guesthouses and hotels. Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are: SafetyWing (best for budget travelers) World Nomads (best for mid-range travelers) InsureMyTrip (for those 70 and over) Medjet (for additional evacuation coverage) Want to Travel for Free?
