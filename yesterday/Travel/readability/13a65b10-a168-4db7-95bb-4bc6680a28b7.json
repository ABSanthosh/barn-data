  "description": "One of Serbia’s most stunning palaces is Staro Zdanje. Although it sits abandoned today, it was once regarded as one of the most beautiful structures in the Principality of Serbia and a fine example of Serbian architecture in the 1880s, which sought to combine traditional Serbian architecture with the Romantic style. Construction began in 1868 under the direction of the European-minded Prince Mihailo Obrenović, who elected Kosta Šrepović for the project. Blending the Serbian identity with European modernity resulted in a stunning ochre building with unique national features and decorative elements. Staro Zdanje, having been initially designed as the Assembly for the Principality of Serbia, transformed into a  summer residence for the Obrenović dynasty after the capital moved from Kragujevac to Belgrade. The side wings display distinctive windows in the national Serbian style, reminiscent of the sacral architecture of the Morava region. One of the building’s highlights is the Prince’s (or Duke’s) Hall, a magnificent ballroom that once featured a central chandelier adorned with numerous crystals, accompanied by four smaller chandeliers. The palace housed valuable art collections and elegant furniture. During the reigns of King Milan and his son King Aleksandar Obrenović, the hall was the site of extravagant balls. Notably, it was here that the young officer Živojin Mišić met his future wife, Lujza Nemica, at one such event. Following the May coup of 1903, Staro Zdanje lost its significance. In 1906, with the introduction of a railway connecting Belgrade to Aranđelovac, Staro Zdanje was for some time repurposed into a hotel. The courtyard of Staro Zdanje is now closed to the public, having fallen into disrepair due to neglect and vandalism. Former Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić had voiced plans to restore the palace. During a visit to Arandjelovac in late 2002, he expressed his desire to the then-Minister of Construction, Dragoslav Šumarac, to have the hotel ready to host delegations in 2004 for the 200th anniversary of Serbian statehood. Following his assassination in 2003, however, this has never been fulfilled, and the building now stands eerily in the Bukovička Banja Park next to the beautiful Hotel Šumadija, another abandoned building of significant cultural importance.",
