  "description": "Every empire needs a core. For a nearly ubiquitous national franchise like Half Price Books, that core can be found in the form of an enormous book warehouse in Dallas, Texas. Situated across the street from the former laundromat where Half Price Books got its start, the vast flagship location—five-times larger than their average store—holds over half a million books, multiple reading rooms, and even a built-in café.  Though its business model is centered around providing bargain prices on used books, some exceptional books have landed at this literary warehouse as well. Signed and rare books worth hundreds of dollars are showcased in glass cases around the store. Befitting their slogan, \"We buy and sell anything printed or recorded except yesterday's newspaper,\" the Half Price Books flagship store also has movies, board games, records, and other forms of media.  As the flagship Half Price Books, this location holds onto some truly top-flight books. Visitors will find a vault of books open for them to walk inside, featuring the rarest and oldest items in the store's vast collection.",
