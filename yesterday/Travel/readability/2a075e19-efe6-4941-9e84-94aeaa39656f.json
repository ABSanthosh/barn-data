  "text": "Big news! I am releasing a new book! It’s a massively updated version of my NYT bestselling travel guide, How to Travel the World on $50 a Day. Except this new edition is called How to Travel the World on $75 a Day. Why the new edition? Well, because of inflation…and the changed way we travel post-COVID. The last edition of my book came out in 2017 and, since then, a lot has changed. COVID forever changed the travel industry. A lot of companies/hotels/hostels closed during the pandemic while old methods of saving money became obsolete and new methods came into being. Destinations around the world have changed too. For example, when I wrote the book’s last edition, there was barely any train travel in Southeast Asia. Now Laos has a train line connecting all its major cities, Cambodia is reviving its train system, and Thailand is expanding theirs. And, since 2017, prices have gone up a lot. Not only because of natural inflation but because of the post-COVID inflation boom. It’s not as cheap to travel as it was back in 2017! Since travel has changed so much, I wanted my book to reflect the current conditions we travelers face when it comes to planning a trip, saving money, and navigating regions around the world. How to be a smart budget traveler is different than it was in 2017 and I want to arm you with all the tools needed to be one. In fact, so much is different, that I ended up writing over 80% of this book! In my mind, it’s not a simple “update” — it’s essentially a new book! (So, if you bought this before, you can buy this new edition without worrying that it’s a lot of the same material!) In this new version, you’ll find: A new section on collecting and redeeming points and miles. A completely updated resource section filled with companies and accommodations I love. More information on overtourism and how to be a responsible traveler. Completely revised and updated and expanded destination sections that include new prices, ways to save, and tips on where to eat, accommodation, transportation, and activities. New trips and tricks on how to save money before you go. New ways to save money on accommodation, including ways to get free accommodation. New ways to save money on transportation (with new information on transportation passes). And that’s just on top of the normal price and information updates that you would expect from new update! This book really puts everything you need to know about saving money and getting off the tourist travel in one place. This book isn’t just for long-term travelers either. It’s for anyone who wants to save money, get off the beaten path, and travel smarter — no matter how long your trip is. Because how you save money on flights or what gear to get or how to save money in London doesn’t change based on how long your trip is! The book comes out on March 25th, 2025 and is currently available for pre-sale at the following places: Amazon Bookshop.org Barnes \u0026 Noble And, as part of this announcement, I am offering limited-time pre-sale offers where, if you buy a copy of the book, you get a few added bonuses. If you purchase the book before the end of the month, you’ll get the following: If you buy one copy of the book, you’ll get my forever gratitude and an ebook of your choice from my collection of online guides. If you buy three copies of the book, you’ll get all 6 of my digital guides. If you buy ten copies of the book, you get all the above PLUS a 30 minute trip planning call with me and a signed copy of my memoir, Ten Years a Nomad. If you want to buy more than ten copies of the book, reach out to me and we’ll work out a bespoke package — anywhere from coming me to your city for lunch to speaking to your event to giving you a free flight! To claim your bonus, all you need to do is email me a copy of your receipt to matt@nomadicmatt.com and I will send it to you. So if you’re interested in the book, please, please please pre-order the book and don’t wait until publication day! Pre-orders determine the print run of the book and how many copies bookstores will pick up. The stronger the pre-sale orders, the more likely they are to stock the book so please order the book in advance! It would mean a lot! The book is available in the U.S. and Canada or as a digital copy globally. (Or you could order from Amazon US and get it shipped to wherever you are in the world.) Here are the links to order the book again: Amazon Bookshop.org Barnes \u0026 Noble If you have any questions, email me! – Matt Book Your Trip: Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner. It’s my favorite search engine because it searches websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is being left unturned. Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use Booking.com as it consistently returns the cheapest rates for guesthouses and hotels. Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are: SafetyWing (best for everyone) InsureMyTrip (for those 70 and over) Medjet (for additional evacuation coverage) Want to Travel for Free? Travel credit cards allow you to earn points that can be redeemed for free flights and accommodation — all without any extra spending. Check out my guide to picking the right card and my current favorites to get started and see the latest best deals. Need Help Finding Activities for Your Trip?
