With general bank cards, consumers amass points that can be used through the issuers’ travel services to book flights, hotels and trips with an array of travel companies.In choosing between them, “one of the biggest considerations is loyalty,” said Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst at the consumer financial site Bankrate.com. “If you only fly one airline or stay in certain hotels, you might lean toward a co-branded card.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
