  "description": "Many people flock to the private beaches and bougie restaurants of this Athens suburb, but beyond the glitz and glamor of the big brand names and the five-star hotels lies a crumbling folly of a chapel.  The construction materials were brought by boat each day and the entire construction was thanks to local fisherman and sculptor Nikolaos Xenos in 1947. A passion project for a local man, that took many years to complete, the chapel is tiny but packed with details including an interior filled with icons. Its architectural style is unlike any other traditional Christian chapel you will find in the city and the folk art, and sea-faring motifs make this holy place stand out against the marina's neighboring restaurants and fashion shops. The chapel sits, tucked away down a short path on the Laimos hill towards the end of the peninsula. Its location is rarely frequented as most people pass it in favor of the scenic views over the Saronic Gulf to the islands on the other side.",
