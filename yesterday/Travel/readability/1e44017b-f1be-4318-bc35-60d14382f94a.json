Credit...Clara Tuma for The New York TimesDec. 19, 2024Updated 4:45 p.m. ETThis winter, if the bookings at Ski.com, North America’s largest ski-focused travel agency, are any indication, one of skiing’s biggest secrets is out: It can be cheaper to ski in Europe than at a U.S. mountain resort.“We are seeing a 43 percent increase in European bookings since last year,” said Dan Sherman, the company’s chief marketing officer. “Skiing in Europe is a bucket list adventure, and people are realizing that there is excellent value for money.”Consider the math: While it will likely cost more to fly to Europe than it would to a U.S. ski resort, you’ll make up the difference in cheaper on-mountain costs, said Melanie Fish, Expedia’s vice president for global public relations. “Apply the money you will save on lift tickets and food to airfare, which will be higher than a domestic flight,” she said.Haley Berg, the lead economist for Hopper, a booking app, said that prices for ski destinations in Europe have not risen significantly over last year.To cut the cost of trans-Atlantic flights, Katy Nastro of Going, an app that finds airfare deals, recommends lower-cost carriers. Scandinavian Airlines’ recent partnership with the SkyTeam alliance, which includes KLM and SAS, offers more connectivity to Oslo, Copenhagen or Stockholm from Delta hubs at a lower cost. Frill-free Norse Atlantic Airways flies nonstop from Los Angeles, New York, Orlando, Fla., and Las Vegas to various European cities, with fares often under $500. Once in Europe, budget airlines like Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz can get you to your final destination.Then the savings begin. A single-day ticket at Aspen, Vail or other destination resorts in the United States can cost upward of $250, though booking ahead brings the cost down, as does purchasing an Ikon or Epic pass. While the passes are deals for dedicated skiers, they are expensive if you ski just a few days each year or decide on a last-minute trip. In contrast, the 4,000 or so ski resorts in Europe, many of them owned by local municipalities or families, generally charge about $75 for a walk-up, one-day lift ticket. Ski lessons and guides are also significantly less expensive.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
