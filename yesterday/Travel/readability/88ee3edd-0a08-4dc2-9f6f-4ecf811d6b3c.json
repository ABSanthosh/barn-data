  "description": "Denver International Airport is notorious for its weird, enigmatic exhibits, from a conspiracy-ridden mural to a massive statue of a demonic horse that killed its own creator. There’s also a pair of Notre-Dame-style gargoyle sculptures above the baggage claim carousels. Just because. Officially titled Notre Denver, the unusual airport gargoyles were created in 1994 by Terry Allen, a country singer-songwriter also known for his career as a playwright and artist. The cast bronze installation depicts the two gargoyles perched inside Samsonite suitcases—note that this famed luggage company originates in Denver—and watching over the passengers as they pick up their personal belongings. The gargoyles here serve as a sort of protective talisman, so that the baggage may return safely to its owner. Unsurprisingly, however, the artwork has fueled the ever-growing conspiracy theories surrounding Denver International. The airport has since seemingly embraced its weirdness, giving a nod to the creepy tales from time to time. In 2019, a new interactive gargoyle was installed, wise-cracking and making references to the airport's conspiracy theories.",
