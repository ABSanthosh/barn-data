But under some circumstances, it may be worth it — and there may even be some savings if you factor in other elements.Credit...Michelle PerezApril 23, 2025, 5:02 a.m. ETLiterally and metaphorically, luggage is the freight of air travel.It’s not just fees that deter fliers from checking bags; it’s the time and hassle involved in reclaiming them as well as the risk they’ll be lost, damaged or delayed. Nearly seven in 1,000 airline passengers globally experience mishandled bags, according to SITA, an airline technology provider.Promising to reduce travel friction, luggage-shipping services have flourished in recent years, offering unburdened transit and the delight of finding your bags waiting for you in your destination.The convenience often comes at a cost above a checked-bag fee. So, we wondered, is it worth it?How Shipping WorksShippable luggage ranges from carry-on bags to large items like golf clubs, skis, bikes, trunks and cardboard boxes.Travelers begin the process by scheduling a shipment online with details about the size and weight of the bag, and pickup and delivery dates, which will influence the price. The bigger the bag and the faster the shipment, the higher the cost. (Most companies advise scheduling a shipment to arrive one business day before you do.)Shipping distance and how you initiate the transit may also affect the price. Services such as Lugless and Ship\u0026Play allow you to drop off your items at a shipment center like FedEx or UPS to save a little money, though pickup is also available.More premium offerings like Luggage Forward and Luggage Free specialize in door-to-door service, collecting bags from private addresses. Delivery destinations can include homes, hotels and offices. Most shipping services recommend that travelers let their hotels know about the shipment and its expected arrival date.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
