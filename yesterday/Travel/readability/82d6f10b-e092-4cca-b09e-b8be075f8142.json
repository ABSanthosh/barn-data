That meant you had to rely on paper maps, physical guidebooks, and (often outdated) information from random web forums. While it made traveling adventurous, it also made planning a trip very difficult. Fortunately, times have changed. It’s never been easier to access information while you’re abroad. From booking hotels to looking up directions to finding places to eat, access to Wi-Fi and mobile data has changed the game. SIM cards were the first step in making this evolution possible. You’d buy an overpriced physical SIM card on arrival and hope that you didn’t blow through the data before your trip ended (or you moved on to a new country). But even those days are past thanks to eSIMs, digital SIM cards you can set up before you even leave home. They are easy to use, affordable, and sometimes even come with awesome perks (more on that below). One of the most popular eSIMs on the market? Saily. In this Saily eSIM review, I’ll break down what Saily offers and how much it costs so that you can decide if it’s the best choice for your next trip. What is Saily? Saily is an eSIM app created by NordVPN. Just like a regular physical SIM card, an eSIM lets you activate and access mobile data while abroad. That means you don’t need to buy a physical SIM card on arrival, you can avoid expensive roaming fees, and you don’t need to use public Wi-Fi (which is often unsafe). For me, the best part of eSIMs is that you can set them up before you leave. That way, you’ll know exactly how much data you have and can pick out the perfect data plan from the comfort of your home. Saily also has 24/7 chat support, so if you have a question or run into problems you can get the help you need. And Saily offers plans in over 200 destinations, which means that no matter where you’re heading, they can ensure you stay connected while you’re there. How to Use a Saily eSIM While using an eSIM might seem more difficult than just popping in a physical SIM card, it’s actually super easy to get started. Here’s what you need to do: Download the app (it’s available on both iOS and Android) Create an account and add your payment info Select the country you’re going to (or the region) Choose your plan Follow the prompts provided That’s it! Now you have an eSIM that activates automatically the moment you land in your destination, saving you the time and energy of having to find one on arrival. What I especially like, though, is that you just need to install the eSIM once. Going to more countries later in the year? No problem. You just add a new plan for that trip and pay for the new data. No reinstalling for every trip. As I said, it’s super easy! How Much Does Saily Cost? Prices for Saily eSIM plans vary by country, but you can find them for as low as $1.99 USD. For example, if you’re heading to Paris for a week, a 7-day plan with 1GB of data costs $3.99 USD. Staying longer? You can get 30 days of coverage and 20GB of data for just $31.99 USD. Super affordable. If you’re visiting more than one country, you can also buy a regional plan. These are available for Europe, Africa, Latin America, and more, with prices starting as low as $4.99 USD. They even have a global plan in case you’re going everywhere! In short, eSIM plans with Saily are very affordable! Added Security Features of Saily What makes Saily stand above the competition though is that they are more than just an eSIM company. Their plans include several awesome perks that make using them a no-brainer. Here’s what’s included: Virtual Location – Saily plans include a virtual location so that you can rest assured your data is secured and private. In the past, I’ve had to buy a separate VPN plan in addition to my eSIMs. Not anymore! Now I can travel knowing my connection is private, secure, and safe from outside access. Ad blocker – Ads not only make surfing the web a pain, but they chew through your data. With an ad blocker activated, you’ll not only have a better online experience but you’ll save more of your data (which saves you money). Web protection – When we travel, we often connect to free public Wi-Fi. While convenient, it also opens you up to all kinds of malware (airports are especially bad for this). Having web protection enabled reduces trackers and malicious websites before they reach your device. This ensures your data is safe as you travel. Pros of Saily Competitive rates vs other eSIM companies Regional plans available for multi-country trips Good data speeds 24/7 customer support Virtual location Ad blocker Web protection Cons of Saily Slightly more expensive than buying a local SIM card No texting or calls *** Saily not only offers a solid product in its eSIM but the added perks make this one of the best eSIM options on the market. It’s affordable, easy to use, and its safety and privacy perks offer incredible extra value. No matter where you’re heading, Saily can ensure you stay connected — without breaking the bank!

It’s my favorite search engine because it searches websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is being left unturned. Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use Booking.com as it consistently returns the cheapest rates for guesthouses and hotels. Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are: SafetyWing (best for budget travelers) World Nomads (best for mid-range travelers) InsureMyTrip (for those 70 and over) Medjet (for additional evacuation coverage) Want to Travel for Free? Travel credit cards allow you to earn points that can be redeemed for free flights and accommodation — all without any extra spending. Check out my guide to picking the right card and my current favorites to get started and see the latest best deals. Need a Rental Car? Discover Cars is a budget-friendly international car rental website. No matter where you’re headed, they’ll be able to find the best — and cheapest — rental for your trip!
