Added bonus: cheaper fares.Viking Cruises is largely credited with creating what it calls the “quiet season” in the Mediterranean. Above, two Viking liners off the coast of the island of Santorini, in Greece.Credit...VikingNov. 11, 2024, 5:00 a.m. ETAfter a summer of overtourism in cruise ports like Barcelona and Amsterdam, and talk of caps on ship arrivals in Greece and other places, the cruise industry has come up with a surprising suggestion for where to sail in winter: Europe.Traditionally, ships stationed in the Mediterranean and Northern Europe in the summer move to the Caribbean and other warm regions in winter.

Low-season sailings in Europe also offer itineraries at bargain prices, often half that of summer fares.The Mediterranean is second only in popularity to the islands of the Caribbean, Bahamas and Bermuda for cruising, according to the Cruise Lines Industry Association.

A veteran of 76 cruises, she has sailed in the Mediterranean as late as December.“You’ve got to accept you’re going to get rain and wind if you’re unlucky,” said Ms. Rushton, 76.When it comes to sightseeing, she added, “The slight downside is that some places may not be open, but the upside is if they are open, they’re not so busy.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
