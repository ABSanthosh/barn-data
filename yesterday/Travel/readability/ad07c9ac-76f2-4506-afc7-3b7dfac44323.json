  "description": "Enscherange is a small village located two kilometers north of the village of Lellingen, which is famous for its Via Botanica. As hikers leave Enscherange in an eastern direction, they will notice a curious structure along a country road: a metal post in the middle of a paved circle accompanied by a sundial and an explanatory plaque. This post marks Kiischpelt Sun Circle, the intersection of the 50th parallel of northern latitude with the 6th meridian of eastern longitude. It is the only place in Luxembourg where a parallel of a full degree of latitude intersects a meridian of a full degree of longitude. Apart from the intersections of the Greenwich meridian and those at the equator, it seems that there are only about 10 such intersections marked by monuments in the world.  The pole is surrounded by other wooden posts which mark the four cardinal points and the angles of sunrise and sunset at the solstices. Next to the pole, an explanatory panel in Lëtzebuergesch and French provides all the necessary information. There is a bench where visitors can enjoy the view over the valley of the Clerve.",
