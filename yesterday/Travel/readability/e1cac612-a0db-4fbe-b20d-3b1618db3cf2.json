  "description": "Italian Paolo Soleri came to America to study under renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1947. From him, Soleri learned a lot regarding the integration of architecture into the landscape, but disagreed immensely with his vision of a spread out, proto-suburban \"Broadacre City.\" After their relationship fell apart and they parted ways, Soleri decided to build his own studio just 10 miles away from Wright's Taliesin West, where he could advance his own architectural and urban planning vision. Its name, Cosanti, is a portmanteau of the Italian words \"cosa\" (thing) and \"anti\" (against), highlighting his opposition to materialism. When Soleri founded Cosanti in 1955, this now wealthy suburban area was a rural hinterland of Phoenix. He constructed much of the home using the unique earth-casting technique, in which a concrete shell was built over a dirt mound that was later removed. In an area where air conditioning is considered mandatory for the summer, he experimented with more natural ways to cool his house. One of his favorite methods was building a partially underground and apses (quarter-spheres) that manipulate the angle of the sun. Unlike Wright, Soleri saw his vision of energy-efficient living that minimized its environmental impact as compatible with urban compactness. As such, he devised \"arcology\" as a way to reconcile these principles and make way for future population growth. This new field was further developed at Arcosanti, his \"urban laboratory\" built 50 miles to the north. Today, a group of artisans still work at Cosanti where they make metal bells, ceramics, and jewelry in Soleri's style. Much of the workshop's unique and surreal architecture is open for regular visits and tours. In its gallery, one can view and buy some of the work made on site and at Arcosanti.",
