  "description": "Fort Zion offers a solid, quirky detour before heading into the grandeur of Zion National Park. Built to resemble one of Utah's old Western frontier towns, the \"fort\" boasts a petting zoo, a gift shop filled with cowboy trinkets and Native American crafts, an ice cream parlor, and a restaurant serving up buffalo, elk, and even rattlesnake burgers. The real star of the show? The \"Virgin Jail,\" a wooden jail that makes for the perfect photo op in the town of Virgin, Utah. Surrounding the jail are other hilariously small Old West-style buildings, including a bank, a saloon, and a \"House of Negotiable Affection.\"",
