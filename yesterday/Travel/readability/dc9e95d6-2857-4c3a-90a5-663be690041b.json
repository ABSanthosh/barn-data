  "description": "Ulus Victory Monument is a landmark located in the Ulus district of Ankara. Designed by Henrich Krippel, the monument was erected to commemorate the victory of Turkish War of Independence under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Inaugurated on November 24, 1927, the Victory Monument is one of the earliest monuments in Turkey's republican era. It features Mustafa Kemal Atatürk on his horse, Sakarya, at the center. Two soldiers are depicted on the front side of the monument, one of whom appears to be gesturing to his friends, inviting them into battle. On the back side, a Turkish woman carries a cannonball, which references the efforts of Turkish women in the War of Independence. Ulus Victory Monument was strategically placed in the Ulus Square to face the old parliament building, ensuring that visiting diplomats would see the monument.",
