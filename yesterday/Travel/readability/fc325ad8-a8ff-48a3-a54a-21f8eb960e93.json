  "description": "Ramla Beach on the north coast of Malta’s island of Gozo is one of the most popular sandy beaches in the archipelago. While most visitors come here to sunbathe and splash around, there's more to this spot than meets the eye. Looming on the hill to the west of the beach are the dilapidated ruins of Ulysses Lodge, Gozo’s most notable abandoned building. The Ulysses Lodge was a popular wedding and events venue in the 1980s. The name of the hotel was chosen to reference the nearby Calypso Cave, which was supposedly the home of the mythological nymph who held the Greek hero Odysseus (Ulysses) captive in The Odyssey.  However, the construction of the hotel at this site was highly controversial, as the local populace felt like it stood out too prominently in one of Gozo’s most scenic locations. Over time, the hotel fell into disrepair. In the late 2000s, the property owners attempted to redevelop the site, only to be met with fierce opposition by local residents. The plans were ultimately scrapped and since that time, the site has remained abandoned.  The crumbling structure has become a popular place to visit for graffiti artists and urban explorers. In spite of being in a state of deterioration, the Ulysses Lodge also still offers some of the best views of the north shore of the island of Gozo.",
