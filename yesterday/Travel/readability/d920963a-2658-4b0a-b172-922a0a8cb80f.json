They help me travel longer, better, and cheaper. Today I want to talk about a card that’s been growing in popularity over the past few years: the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card. It’s designed for travelers who want to easily rack up miles without having to keep track of bonus categories. And, in the past couple of years, they have really improved the card. It’s one of the main cards I use now because I love their travel portal, their transfer partners, and all the perks that come with the card. With a hefty sign-up bonus, premium travel benefits, and an impressive rewards structure, the Venture X is worth considering if you’re looking for a new card. Here’s everything you need to know about the card and why I think you should consider getting it: Table of ContentsWhat is the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card?Other Perks and Benefits of the Capital One Venture XUsing Your Capital One MilesPros of the Capital One Venture XCons of the Capital One Venture XWho is this card for?Who is this card not for?   What is the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card? The Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is a travel rewards card issued by Capital One. What I love about this card is its miles system. For every dollar you spend, you earn two miles, which (along with the lower-fee Capital One Venture Rewards Card) is unique among travel credit cards. There’s also no additional cost for up to four authorized users, making this a good option for families who need several cards. In addition to earning at least 2x miles on every purchase, you can earn miles the following ways: 75,000 bonus miles when you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account 10x miles on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel 5x miles on flights and vacation rentals booked through Capital One Travel Other Perks and Benefits of the Capital One Venture X Aside from earning miles, the Venture X packs a punch with its range of perks: $300 travel credit when booking through the Capital One portal Up to $120 credit for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck Unlimited complimentary access to Capital One, Priority Pass, and Plaza Premium lounges 10,000 bonus miles every year, starting on your first anniversary $100 experience credit and other premium benefits with every hotel and vacation rental booked from the Premier Collection Travel insurance coverage, including primary car rental insurance, trip interruption and cancellation, and luggage reimbursement No foreign transaction fees With an annual fee of $395, it’s also the cheapest premium travel card out there (plus, if you can use the $300 travel credit, that brings the fee down to a manageable $95). Using Your Capital One Miles Capital One miles can be redeemed in a few ways. One is by booking travel directly through Capital One’s portal. While I usually don’t recommend booking through credit card portals, to fully benefit from the Venture X’s travel credit, you’ll need to book at least $300 worth of travel this way. Another option is to use your miles to get reimbursed for any travel purchase. For 90 days after making such a purchase, you can reimburse yourself at a redemption rate of one cent per mile. After 90 days, and for all other purchases, you can use miles as cash back, at a redemption rate of 0.5 cents per mile (but avoid doing this, as it’s not a good value). However, you’ll get the most out of your miles by transferring them to Capital One’s 15+ airline and hotel partners. While the actual value varies based on what you book, you can usually find airline and hotel redemptions worth much more than the aforementioned one cent per mile. (The process is pretty straightforward and can be done through your Capital One account.) Here are Capital One’s current travel partners: Accor Live Limitless Aeromexico Club Premier Air Canada Aeroplan Air France/KLM Flying Blue Avianca LifeMiles British Airways Executive Club Cathay Pacific Asia Miles Choice Privileges Emirates Skywards Etihad Airways Guest EVA Air Infinity MileageLands Finnair Plus Qantas Frequent Flyer Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer TAP Portugal Miles\u0026Go Turkish Airlines Miles\u0026Smiles Virgin Red Wyndham Rewards Using transfer partners is a game-changer if you’re looking to maximize the value of your miles. That’s why, unless I find a super cheap flight or hotel room (less than $150 USD), I always transfer miles to Capital One’s travel partners. That’s especially true when booking business class flights or fancy hotel rooms. You just get more value for your money. Plus, with tools like point.me and Awayz (search engines that help you find the best flights and hotels to book with miles), it’s easier than ever to find the best redemption options. Pros of the Capital One Venture X Substantial welcome offer 2x miles on every purchase $300 annual travel credit 15+ transfer partners Travel accident and car rental insurance Up to a $120 credit for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck Access to Capital One and Priority Pass airport lounges No foreign transaction fees Cons of the Capital One Venture X Steep $395 annual fee Must use Capital One’s Travel Portal to take advantage of some benefits (e.g., 10x miles per dollar on hotels, vacation rentals, and rental cars) Transfer partners are a bit lacking (no US airlines and not the best hotels) Who is this card for? The Capital One Venture X is best for frequent travelers who want a straightforward card with a higher earning rate on all purchases. If you frequently fly and stay in hotels, and are willing to pay an annual fee for premium benefits, this card is tailored for you. Who is this card not for? On the flip side, if you’re not a frequent traveler or don’t spend enough to offset the $395 annual fee, the Venture X might not be the best fit. It’s also not ideal if you’re looking for a card with a high rewards rate in specific categories like dining or groceries. If you travel occasionally or prefer a lower annual fee, you might want to pick another card that better aligns with your spending habits and travel frequency. Because there is no right card — only the card that’s right for you! *** The Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is a powerhouse for those who travel often and want to enjoy top-tier perks. Weigh the pros and cons to see if it’s the right fit for your travel lifestyle but I bet it is! Like I said in the intro, it’s one of my favorite cards and I definitely recommend getting it. Book Your Trip: Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner. It’s my favorite search engine because it searches websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is being left unturned. Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use Booking.com as it consistently returns the cheapest rates for guesthouses and hotels. Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are: SafetyWing (best for everyone) InsureMyTrip (for those 70 and over) Medjet (for additional evacuation coverage) Want to Travel for Free? Travel credit cards allow you to earn points that can be redeemed for free flights and accommodation — all without any extra spending.
