    "description": "Masters of Scale brings you a special episode of Pivot with Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway featuring conversation with our show’s founding host Reid Hoffman. Together, they discuss the hype and fears around DeepSeek, why spending money on AI is a good thing and insights from Reid’s newest book: \"Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future.\" Then, Kara and Scott discuss Meta settling with Trump for $25 million, and the White House attempt to take a page out of Elon's playbook in offering buyouts to federal employees. Plus, the contentious RFK Jr. hearings. And will Kara get a podcaster seat at the White House briefings? We hope you enjoy! About Pivot:Every Tuesday and Friday, tech journalist Kara Swisher and NYU Professor Scott Galloway offer sharp, unfiltered insights into the biggest stories in tech, business, and politics. They make bold predictions, pick winners and losers, and bicker and banter like no one else. After all, with great power comes great scrutiny.

    "description": "Summary En el reciente episodio de nuestro podcast, tuvimos el honor de conversar con Andy Choque, gerente general de Banacorp S.R.L. y miembro de la mesa directiva de la Unión de Bananeros (UNIBAN) en Bolivia.  Andy nos compartió detalles sobre la vida cotidiana de los productores de banano en la región del Chapare, Cochabamba. Desde las primeras horas del día, los agricultores se dedican al cuidado meticuloso de las plantaciones, asegurando que cada planta reciba la atención necesaria para producir frutos de alta calidad. Este arduo trabajo refleja la dedicación y compromiso de los bananeros bolivianos con su tierra y producto. La banana boliviana ha ganado reconocimiento en mercados internacionales por su sabor distintivo y calidad superior. Andy destacó que factores como el clima favorable del Chapare y las prácticas agrícolas sostenibles contribuyen a estas características. Además, la proximidad geográfica a mercados clave en Sudamérica permite una distribución más eficiente y rápida, garantizando que el producto llegue fresco a los consumidores. La industria bananera boliviana ha enfrentado desafíos significativos en los últimos tiempos. Andy mencionó que, debido a bloqueos y conflictos sociales, se han perdido cajas de banano destinadas a la exportación, lo que representa pérdidas económicas considerables para los productores.    Show Notes (00:05) Welcome \u0026 introduction.

    "description": "Summary In this episode of Startup Junkies, hosts Daniel Koonce, Jeff Amerine, and Harrison Kitson sit down with Anna Buckley, the dynamic founder of PICNiC. Balancing a full-time job and a burgeoning side hustle, Anna embodies the spirit of modern entrepreneurship. Based in Washington, D.C., by way of Arkansas, Anna brings innovative solutions to classic designs, filling gaps in the market and elevating everyday dining experiences. PICNiC, launched in March, was born from Anna’s desire to create durable and aesthetically pleasing cabbageware—plates inspired by the timeless cabbage design but made from hard plastic melamine. The idea sprouted during a planned picnic on the D.C. National Mall. Frustrated by the lack of durable, non-ceramic cabbageware plates available, Anna saw an opportunity and seized it. After graduating from the University of Arkansas in 2023 with a degree in finance, Anna moved to D.C. to start her career at Ernst \u0026 Young (EY) as a business consultant. Her entrepreneurial spirit, however, couldn’t be contained. Leveraging her time management skills and type-A personality, she worked tirelessly after hours to bring PICNiC to life. By September, her products were ready, marking a significant milestone in her journey. Anna’s entrepreneurial drive was evident even in college, where she interned at Startup Junkie and participated in the Student Activity and Curriculum Enhancement (S.A.K.E.) program. These experiences laid the foundation for her current success, providing her with invaluable insights and mentorship. As PICNiC grows, Anna envisions expanding her product line and engaging in more collaborations. Through her journey, she aims to inspire and mentor budding entrepreneurs, sharing her story to show that with passion and perseverance, one can indeed balance business and personal interests. Tune in today!   Show Notes (00:00) Introduction (01:16) PICNiC’s Elevator Pitch (02:14) Anna’s Origin Story (03:53) About Anna’s Entrepreneurial Journey (04:40) Balancing Government Consulting and Entrepreneurship (05:28) Describing Cabbageware (06:25) Identifying and Filling a Gap in the Market (08:31) Overcoming Entrepreneurial Problems (09:41) Preparing for the Future with Marketing (12:48) Being a Solo Entrepreneur (13:42) Future Collaborations and a Vision of Success (15:28) Anna’s Desire to Educate and Past Mentors (19:09) What Anna Has Learned Working in Corporate America (21:47) Advice to Younger Self (23:21) Closing Question   Links Daniel Koonce Jeff Amerine Harrison Kitson Startup Junkie Startup Junkie YouTube Anna Buckley PICNiC",

    "description": "This episode is part of a new experiment called Meditation Monday. The teacher, Henry Shukman, has been on my podcast twice before. He is one of only a few dozen masters in the world authorized to teach Sanbo Zen, and now, he’ll be your teacher.In addition to my long-form interviews each week, every Monday I’ll bring you a short 10-minute or so meditation, which will help you for the rest of the week.Over this four-episode series, you’ll develop a Zen toolkit to help you find greater calm, peace, and effectiveness in your daily life.Henry’s app, The Way, has changed my life since I first started using it. Unlike other meditation apps, where you’re overwhelmed with a thousand choices, The Way is a clear step-by-step training program guided entirely by Henry. Through a logical progression, you’ll develop real skills that stick with you.I’ve been using it daily, often twice a day, and it’s lowered my anxiety more than I thought possible.As a listener of my podcast, you can get 30 free sessions by visiting https://thewayapp.com/tim and downloading the app.See Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
