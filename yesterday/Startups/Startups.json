As a pilot, Tyler had the opportunity to explore these facilities extensively, learning what worked and what could be improved upon.The Watkins talk about the rapid growth of their venture, describing the first few months since their December 2024 launch as a whirlwind.

    "description": "SummaryIn this engaging episode of Startup Junkies, hosts Daniel Koonce, Harrison Kitson, and Jeff Amerine welcome back Bo Counts, the founder of Pinpoint Fayetteville. Bo returns to discuss the fascinating niche he’s carved out with Pinpoint, Arkansas’s only barcade that uniquely blends retro pinball games with craft cocktails. Delving into his journey, Bo shares how his collection hobby morphed into a full-fledged business that prioritizes unique experiences over typical bar antics.Bo is renowned for his knack for trend prediction, playfully dubbed “Boastrodonics.” He reflects on market shifts, noting how Pinpoint has offered non-alcoholic cocktails since 2017—an initially overlooked concept that’s gaining traction. Listeners are offered a behind-the-scenes peek into the complexities of the spirits industry, from navigating inventory challenges to innovating with popular drinks like the espresso martini. Bo also sheds light on the cultural factors influencing drinking habits, emphasizing how economic pressures steer consumers towards familiar favorites.Beyond pinball and cocktails, Bo’s impact extends into local entrepreneurship, where he serves on boards and consults aspiring businesses. His insights on collaboration and pushing the envelope are not only inspiring but also a testament to his commitment to community growth. As he ventures into new frontiers with projects like a restaurant and champagne bar, Bo leaves listeners with valuable advice: embrace the unknown, follow happiness, and always strive for innovation.
