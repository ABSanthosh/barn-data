Cesar Carvalho, co-founder and CEO of Wellhub (formerly Gympass), joins host Jeff Berman to make that case and share his vision for the B2B platform providing wellness services and gym access to people worldwide via their employers.

Skadden Arps’ attorney, Rachel Cohen, encouraged the firm to fight the government’s pressure, only to have her attempts rebuffed and to be effectively forced out from the firm. Cohen joins Rapid Response to share her dramatic story, and fears about how the rule of law is changing in America.

Bo returns to discuss the fascinating niche he’s carved out with Pinpoint, Arkansas’s only barcade that uniquely blends retro pinball games with craft cocktails. Delving into his journey, Bo shares how his collection hobby morphed into a full-fledged business that prioritizes unique experiences over typical bar antics.Bo is renowned for his knack for trend prediction, playfully dubbed “Boastrodonics.” He reflects on market shifts, noting how Pinpoint has offered non-alcoholic cocktails since 2017—an initially overlooked concept that’s gaining traction. Listeners are offered a behind-the-scenes peek into the complexities of the spirits industry, from navigating inventory challenges to innovating with popular drinks like the espresso martini. Bo also sheds light on the cultural factors influencing drinking habits, emphasizing how economic pressures steer consumers towards familiar favorites.Beyond pinball and cocktails, Bo’s impact extends into local entrepreneurship, where he serves on boards and consults aspiring businesses. His insights on collaboration and pushing the envelope are not only inspiring but also a testament to his commitment to community growth. As he ventures into new frontiers with projects like a restaurant and champagne bar, Bo leaves listeners with valuable advice: embrace the unknown, follow happiness, and always strive for innovation.
