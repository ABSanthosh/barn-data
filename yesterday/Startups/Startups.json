    "description": "Summary In this episode of Startup Junkies, we dive into the electrifying world of lithium, renewable energy innovations, and its impact on the economy. Hosts Caleb Talley and Jeff Amerine are joined by guests Florence Meaders, program manager of the Lithium Regional Innovation Cluster (LRIC) and Matt Newman and Aviram Hadash from Brightmerge, who explore the profound potential of the Smackover Formation in South Arkansas and the revolutionary technologies shaping the future. One key highlight of the episode was the transformative potential of the Smackover Formation, which has the capacity to supply ten times more lithium than the entire U.S. currently produces. Florence emphasized its unique extraction process—direct lithium extraction (DLE)—which minimizes environmental impact compared to traditional methods. Additionally, Brightmerge’s cutting-edge innovations were also in the spotlight, with CEO, Aviram, detailing how their technology solves key challenges in optimizing electric vehicle (EV) fleet charging and microgrid design. Focusing on tailored, data-driven solutions, their platform helps fleet owners determine optimal charging schedules, equipment, and total cost of ownership (TCO), while factoring in local energy resources and environmental variables. Partnering companies like Volo X amplify their mission to make EV transitions both practical and economical. Matt provided a broader perspective, stressing the importance of diversifying energy sources to accommodate future demands. From smarter lithium usage to energy storage evolution, the conversation stressed the need for strategic partnerships, resource recycling, and advancing battery technology. This episode encapsulates the profound transformation underway in energy and logistics—underscoring innovation, collaboration, and sustainability as key drivers of progress.

What you will hear in this episode will help you identify both your and your partner’s losing strategies in relationships, and help you move from disharmony to repair. Terry is the creator of Relational Life Therapy, or RLT, which underpins all his books, courses, and teachings and equips people with the powerful relational skills they need to make love work. He is also the author of five books, including the New York Times bestseller Us: Getting Past You and Me to Build a More Loving Relationship. And if you’d like an extra dose of calm, I recommend checking out Henry Shukman, a past podcast guest and one of only a few dozen masters in the world authorized to teach Sanbo Zen. Henry’s app, The Way, has changed my life. I’ve been using it daily, often twice a day, and it’s lowered my anxiety more than I thought possible. For 30 free sessions, just visit thewayapp.com/tim.
