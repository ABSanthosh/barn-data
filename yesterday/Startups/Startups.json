From the get-go, Catelyn‚Äôs entrepreneurial spirit shines through as she shares the story of how she transformed a mobile soda trailer into a bustling brick-and-mortar storefront.¬†With a background as a hairstylist and a drive to do something different, Catelyn jumped into small business ownership inspired by her father‚Äôs example and a desire to carve a unique path. Chug NWA‚Äôs menu, full of inventive soda recipes developed by Catelyn and her team, sets it apart from chain competitors like Sonic and Swig. The Cowboy (Dr. Pepper, vanilla, and homemade coconut cream) is a local favorite, alongside ‚Äúguy-favorite‚Äù combos like the Float Trip (root beer, butterscotch, and vanilla).Listeners will love hearing about the challenges and rewards of running both a storefront and a mobile drink truck‚Äîfrom serving teacher appreciation events to handling equipment stress and expanding the menu with soft pretzels to boost revenue.Additionally, Catelyn opens up about balancing entrepreneurship and motherhood, the importance of instilling confidence and skills in her young team, and her long-term vision of expanding‚Äîperhaps with her daughter‚Äôs help someday. Her advice to herself and other entrepreneurs? ‚ÄúYou only grow when you‚Äôre uncomfortable‚Äîkeep grinding and never give up.‚Äù For anyone inspired by grassroots business and community, this episode is a must-listen!Show Notes(00:00) Introduction(01:08) About Chug NWA(05:35) Challenges vs Opportunities with a Mobile Truck(08:42) Promoting Efficiency and Speed in Production(11:50) Chug NWA Expansion Plans(15:20) Combating Uncertainty with Optimism(17:03) Embracing Discomfort to Grow(17:31) Closing ThoughtsLinksDaniel KoonceJeff AmerineStartup JunkieStartup Junkie YouTubeCatelyn HooserChug NWA",
