From the get-go, Catelyn‚Äôs entrepreneurial spirit shines through as she shares the story of how she transformed a mobile soda trailer into a bustling brick-and-mortar storefront.¬†With a background as a hairstylist and a drive to do something different, Catelyn jumped into small business ownership inspired by her father‚Äôs example and a desire to carve a unique path. Chug NWA‚Äôs menu, full of inventive soda recipes developed by Catelyn and her team, sets it apart from chain competitors like Sonic and Swig. The Cowboy (Dr. Pepper, vanilla, and homemade coconut cream) is a local favorite, alongside ‚Äúguy-favorite‚Äù combos like the Float Trip (root beer, butterscotch, and vanilla).Listeners will love hearing about the challenges and rewards of running both a storefront and a mobile drink truck‚Äîfrom serving teacher appreciation events to handling equipment stress and expanding the menu with soft pretzels to boost revenue.Additionally, Catelyn opens up about balancing entrepreneurship and motherhood, the importance of instilling confidence and skills in her young team, and her long-term vision of expanding‚Äîperhaps with her daughter‚Äôs help someday.
