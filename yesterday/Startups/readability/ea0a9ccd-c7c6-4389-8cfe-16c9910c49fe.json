  "text": "Verizon is stepping up its game in support of the military community with a new set of benefits tailored for service members and their families. The telecommunications giant has introduced a short-term military suspension option, making it easier for those deployed for less than 90 days to maintain their services at a reduced cost. For small business owners who may hire veterans or have military families among their employees, these updates could provide valuable insights into supporting their staff effectively while saving money. Verizon’s Military Short Term Suspend option allows customers who are deployed for less than three months to suspend their line for just $10 a month, or at the price of their monthly service—whichever is lower. This flexibility not only reduces costs but also ensures that service members maintain the option to stay connected during their deployment without incurring significant charges. Longer deployment situations still offer suspension options that range from 90 days to three years, allowing military members to bypass payments for services entirely during their absence. “Our military personnel in training or those on short-term domestic assignments deserve an option tailored to their needs,” said Sowmyanarayan Sampath, Verizon Consumer CEO. This commitment serves as a reminder for small business owners to recognize and accommodate the unique needs of their military employee base. In addition to the new suspension options, Verizon provides a range of exclusive offers for active military personnel including significant discounts on phone plans and home internet services. Military customers can access four lines starting at $25 per line through Verizon’s Unlimited Welcome plan, which comes with additional savings for customers who bundle mobile and home services. By signing up for Fios Home Internet with Auto Pay, customers can access plans for as low as $30 a month. This can be a point of interest for small businesses looking to provide telecom benefits to military-affiliated staff. By implementing these generous offerings, Verizon positions itself as a leader in the telecom market while simultaneously enhancing customer experience. Along with lower service costs, the company is also committed to providing dedicated resources for military families, such as discounts on accessories, extensive career tools, and specialized in-store resources. This holistic approach to support could inspire small business owners to create similar initiatives for their own workforce, perhaps through partnerships that offer discounts or training for military veterans. However, with all offerings, business owners should also consider potential challenges. While the simplification of service suspension could simplify billing and allow military employees to focus on their duties, managing benefits for a diverse workforce—especially if it includes veterans and active-duty service members—can complicate human resource policies. Ensuring all employees are correctly informed about these benefits and eligible for participation requires attention and potentially additional resources. Additionally, the need for employees to verify their military status through platforms like ID.me could create friction, especially if the verification process is not user-friendly. Small businesses may need to provide guidance or support to ensure staff can navigate these systems effectively—an area that requires attention. Verizon’s efforts to enhance military benefits illustrate a growing trend in corporate responsibility and employee engagement strategies that can resonate well within the small business sector. As more companies recognize the importance of serving those who serve, small business owners have the chance to innovate their own operational practices and employee benefits. For more detailed information on the new military benefits offered by Verizon, you can visit the original press release at Verizon’s Newsroom. These initiatives are more than just a marketing strategy; they present an opportunity for businesses to reflect and respond to the needs of a significant portion of their workforce.
