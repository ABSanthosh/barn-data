Sugarcane is consistently one of the most widely produced crops in the world, and its cultivation is linked to mass deforestation in vulnerable ecosystems as well as highly unsustainable freshwater consumption. Wanting to develop sweet treats that don’t cost the environment, The Supplant Company turned away from sugarcane in favour of agricultural waste. The company sources its raw ingredients, which include agricultural by-products like oat hulls, wheat stalks, and corn cobs, from farms, forests, and food manufacturers. The multi-patented process then begins with fungi enzymes, which break down the fibrous waste so that it can then be cleaned, dried, and turned into new, value-added ingredients. Supplant’s first ingredient was a greener alternative to cane sugar, called Sugars from Fiber. As well as being made from waste instead of raw materials, Supplant’s Sugars from Fiber also have half the calories of normal sugar and a lower glycemic response than glucose. Plus, they contain gut-boosting prebiotics while also maintaining the desired level of sweetness. Supplant then also uses its sugar ingredient to create the Multi-Purpose Baking Base – a baking mix for healthier muffins, scones, cakes, and more. In addition to sugar, the company also produces the Supplant Grain \u0026 Stalk Flour made from both wheat grain and wheat stalk, which can be used to make pasta, baked goods, bread, and pastries. Like Sugars from Fiber, the Grain \u0026 Stalk Flour has fewer calories and carbohydrates than regular flour, as well as seven times more fibre. According to the company, by making use of the ordinarily discarded wheat stalks, global wheat production output could be boosted by a third. Supplant has incorporated its innovative ingredients in a range of products, including shortbread biscuits and a range of chocolate bars that were developed in collaboration with Michelin-starred chef Thomas Keller. Companies that are interested in developing more products with Supplant’s ingredients are encouraged to get in touch.
