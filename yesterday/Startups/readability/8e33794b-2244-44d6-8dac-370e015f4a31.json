The music event featured Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Ice Spice and the late Juice WRLD. The event is taking the global entertainment chops of Fortnite to a new level, with a big takeover in Times Square in New York. (We made it to the Nasdaq Tower in Times Square this week too) As tough a time as gaming has had in the past year, there’s no denying its growth in worldwide entertainment culture. Fortnite, Ice Spice, and Snoop Dogg delivered a performance in Times Square last night, blending sound and visuals into a stunning takeover. Simultaneously, the event streamed live in Fortnite, pulling players into an immersive cityscape to experience the concert firsthand, complete with a surprise preview of Snoop’s new track, “Gorgeous,” from his upcoming album. Snoop Dogg is appearing in real life in Times Square and inside Fortnite Battle Royale. The event, dubbed Remix: The Prelude, kicks off a music and gaming month bridging the real world and Fortnite in the next season of Fortnite Battle Royale, Chapter 2 Remix, launching today. Chapter 2 Remix arrives with musicians Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Ice Spice, and Juice WRLD, bringing their fashion, music and artistry to Fortnite alongside the popular original Fortnite gameplay from 2020. In a first for Fortnite, players can engage with each artist through themed gameplay locations launching week by week. Players can also express themselves and rep each music legend through individual artist Outfits found in the Fortnite Shop. Chapter 2 Remix is ending on a special note with Remix: The Finale – a live event on November 30 at 11 a.m. Pacific time. To honor Juice’s legacy and love for Fortnite, all players who log in between 10 p.m. on November 29 and 10 p.m. on November 30 will receive the cel-shaded Slayer Juice WRLD Outfit. “Jarad always loved to play Fortnite – it was more than just entertainment for him, it was a way to connect with others. From a young age, video games were a part of how he bonded with friends and family, and being in Fortnite is an incredible tribute to that connection. I know he would be overjoyed to see how his love for games continues to bring people together across different spaces, just like his music does,” said Carmela Wallace, mother of Jarad “Juice WRLD” Higgins, in a statement. Gaming goes to Times Square in a big way with Snoop Dogg and Fortnite Battle Royale. Juice WRLD died earlier this year in an accident. During this week, Snoop Dogg will enter Fortnite Battle Royale and be featured as the Icon for Season 6 of the music-driven, rhythm-based game Fortnite Festival. “Being part of Fortnite is all about creating, playing, and sharing my music and culture with the next generation. My son Cordell’s a big Fortnite player with me, so when we had the opportunity we jumped on it as a new way to connect with my sound and style. Anyone can be Snoop in Fortnite,” said Snoop Dogg in a statement. During the week of November 7, Eminem will reappear following his original Fortnite debut in December 2023. “Guess who’s back, ready for combat, man! I’m serving all new gear along with a side of spaghetti…come and get it! Feels good to return to Fortnite for more mayhem,” said Eminem, in a statement. And during the week of November 14, Ice Spice will arrive to take you into her experience as the Princess of New York. “Getting the chance to come to the game and remix the Chapter 2 map is unreal. It’s exciting to be a part of something so iconic, and I can’t wait for players to experience this new vibe. Fortnite is all about creativity and connection, and I’m hyped to bring my own spin to it,” said Ice Spice, in a statement. And during the week of November 21, the legacy, music and style of Juice WRLD is celebrated. This season also introduces Kicks, a brand new cosmetic coming to Fortnite. The initial lineup of Kicks will feature Nike and Jordan brands alongside Fortnite original designs with more brands to be announced in the future. The first pair of Jordans will be available beginning on November 12 as part of the season’s Remix Pass. Chapter 2 Remix is a nostalgic new take on Fortnite Battle Royale Seasons players will remember from the original Chapter 2. Chapter 2 Remix comes nearly one year after the launch of Fortnite OG, where Fortnite saw over 100 million players in that month. VB Daily Stay in the know!
