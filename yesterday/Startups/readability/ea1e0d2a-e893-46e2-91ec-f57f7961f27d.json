  "text": "Rivian has added a high-profile new executive to its board: Aidan Gomez, cofounder and CEO of generative AI company Cohere. The appointment signals Rivian is prioritizing AI on the back of a $5.8 billion deal the EV-maker struck with Volkswagen to develop EV software. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gomez will serve in the position until 2026.  Gomez brings substantial expertise in AI to Rivian’s board. He kicked off his career working as a researcher at Google, where at just 20 years old, he co-authored a seminal paper on a new deep learning architecture that Time notes fundamentally changed the AI industry. He went on to cofound Cohere to help enterprises use generative AI in applications such as chatbots and search engines. Cohere boasts backing from AMD, Nvidia, Oracle, and Salesforce and a valuation of $5.5 billion as of its latest funding round last July. Exactly how Gomez’s expertise might help Rivian isn’t clear, but the announcement does come on the heels of a $5.8 billion joint venture Rivian formed with Volkswagen to accelerate the development of EV software and reduce the cost of the vehicles. The joint venture builds on the software and electrical architecture of Rivian, with the company expected to license out its intellectual property to the joint venture. Although both companies expressed the intention of developing vehicles based on the technology that comes out of the venture, TechCrunch reported they may also sell its technology to other companies.  Meanwhile, Rivian is also pushing ahead with advanced driver assistance features, and in March launched a hands-free driver assistance feature that is meant to work on 135,000 miles of highway across the U.S. and Canada. The company is targeting 2026 for a “hands off/eyes off” feature. TechCrunch also reported that Rivian has been working to develop an AI-powered assistant for its vehicles for several years, although that work is not covered by the joint venture. The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply Today.",
