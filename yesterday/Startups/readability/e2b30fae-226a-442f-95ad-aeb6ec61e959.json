I said, “Fine,” which wasn’t a particularly compelling or enthusiastic answer.We ended up discussing ‘Acts of Ego’, which I acknowledged was a big part of the book. By definition, the book is an act of ego, and while it’s not a memoir, there are a lot of “Brad stories” that I use as examples to support the points I’m trying to make. I’ve received both positive and negative feedback on this, and while the positive feedback feels good, I haven’t yet figured out what to do with the negative feedback.At some point, I blurted out ‘Axe the Ego’ as an effort to neutralize how I was feeling. We both chuckled and continued to talk about ego. And then Amy mentioned Dust in the Wind.… Now don’t hang onNothin’ lasts forever but the earth and skyIt slips awayAnd all your money won’t another minute buyI must have listened to this song a thousand times when I was a young teenager. The words are imprinted on my brain.(All we are is dust in the wind)Dust in the wind(Everything is dust in the wind)Everything is dust in the windI have two friends who went to Israel last week to visit friends and family. Both are safe right now, but having an unexpected adventure as two countries on the other side of the world fire missiles at each other while the rest of the world talks about … all kinds of things.The river behind our house doesn’t care. The trees don’t care. The rocks, which have been here long before us and will remain here long after us, don’t care.We are all just dust in the wind.",
