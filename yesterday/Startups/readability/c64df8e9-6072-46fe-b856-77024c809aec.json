It's extraordinary.\"Porat mentioned that it was \"beautiful\" to see Google Search go from \"10 blue links,\" or the 10 links per page that characterized Google's old search result interface, to now AI overviews, or AI-written summaries of search results that populate at the top of Search. \"It keeps evolving,\" she said.Google CIO Ruth Porat.
