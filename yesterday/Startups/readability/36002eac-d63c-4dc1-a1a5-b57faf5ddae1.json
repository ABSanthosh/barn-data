  "text": "Over 1,400 Google employees signed a petition this week calling for more job security and asked the company to implement buyouts, or financial incentive packages to leave the company voluntarily, instead of resorting to mass layoffs.Now, Google appears to be taking them up on their advice, beginning with a buyout.Google senior vice president Rick Osterloh sent a memo to all staff on the platforms and devices (P\u0026D) team on Thursday morning informing them about a \"voluntary exit program.\" All employees in that division were given the option to leave Google on their own in exchange for a severance package of undisclosed value. Related: Google Is Losing Ground to Unexpected Rivals in Search Ad Revenue and Name Popularity, According to New Estimates\"The Platforms \u0026 Devices team is offering a voluntary exit program that provides US-based Googlers working on this team the ability to voluntarily leave the company with a severance package,\" Osterloh wrote in the memo. He said that the exit program could benefit those who might not be passionate about the team's mission of \"building great products, with speed and efficiency\" or those facing difficulty with their roles. Google confirmed that the voluntary exit program was happening to 9to5Google. The buyout only applies to U.S. employees in the P\u0026D division, not to other groups like Search or AI.Google created the P\u0026D unit in April 2024 by merging the team responsible for devices and services, including Pixel smartphones and Chromebooks, with the platforms and ecosystems team, which handled Android and Chrome software.Related: Google CEO Sundar Pichai Says 'You'll Be Surprised' By How Google Search ChangesGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai stated at the time that the move was meant to \"speed up decision-making,\" \"bring the best innovations to partners faster,\" and \"help us deliver higher quality products and experiences.\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai.

According to its latest earnings report, it had a headcount of 181,269 employees.Google posted better-than-expected third-quarter earnings in late October, which saw Google Services bring in $76.5 billion in revenue.Related: Google Says It Won't Follow Amazon's Lead With a Return-to-Office Mandate — Yet",
