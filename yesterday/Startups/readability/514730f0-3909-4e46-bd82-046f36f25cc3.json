  "text": "If you take the time to read through Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism, there are plenty of shocking moments, though most are not all that surprising. The reason the book has become a best-seller is that Meta tried to block the publication of a bunch of stories that mostly line up with what people already think about the company and its leaders.I don’t know how much of it is true or if author Sarah Wynn-Williams embellished or, worse, outright made anything up. I’m also not entirely sure it matters. Sure, you shouldn’t make up stories to get back at your old boss, but the force with which Meta has attempted to shut down Wynn-Williams’ account makes it seem as though a lot of it is probably true. With that in mind, there are five lessons every leader should take away from this book.Principles vs profitThere is nothing about running a business that says you can’t have principles and still make a profit. Lots of successful businesses do that. Of course, it depends on how strongly you believe in those principles, and how willing you are to stick to them even when an opportunity comes along that could be very profitable if you’re willing to ditch them.In the case of Facebook, that dilemma is never more clear than when it comes to founder Mark Zuckerberg’s desire to expand his company into China. The reason isn’t surprising. In China, more than 650 million people use the internet, according to Wynn-Williams. That’s a pretty big target if you’re running a social platform measured in billions of users.“China is, in Mark’s eyes, just the end of a to-do list, the last major project to tackle,” writes Wynn-Williams. It’s an opportunity too good to pass up, even if it might conflict with what the company says it stands for.“The mission of the company—making the world more open and connected—is the exact opposite of what the Chinese Communist Party wants, particularly under President Xi Jinping,” she writes. “I can’t imagine they’d allow us in. And I don’t want to help Facebook try. The way I see it, the only way in will be to collaborate with the CCP and make compromises we shouldn’t.”That last sentence says a lot about what motivates and drives a lot of people. If your goal is to expose your product to more than 1 billion people, and the only way to do that is to give in on what you say are care about, often it is the principles that give way to the opportunity for profit.Incentives matterAs a general rule, people will always lean towards the incentives you give them. If you want someone to do something, reward them for doing it. Make it a part of their job description and then compensate them for accomplishing whatever it is you want them to do.If you prioritize growth, the people who work for you will prioritize growth. That’s true, by the way, even if you spend a lot of time talking about other things that are not growth. You can say whatever you want about what is most important but if you reward people for things like growth or engagement, they will spend all of their time trying to accomplish those things, and they will spend very little time on things like making the world better.Or, put another way: you can say you want people to do the right thing or claim to have a noble mission, but if you incentivize people to maximize engagement, they’ll just turn that dial no matter what the unintended consequences.Unintended consequences are still realThis leads to one of the most blistering criticisms of the book. During a chapter where she talks about an organ donation initiative pushed by Sandberg, Wynn-Williams describes her attempts to dissuade her boss from rolling out an issue with such fraught consequences. At one point, Marne Levine, who at the time was Facebook’s new vice president of global public policy, interjects.“Usually when Facebook releases new features, once the code is pushed, there’s not a lot of thought to the real world consequences,” Levine says. Her point was that this subject was far more nuanced with many different local laws and regulations around the subject, making it a poor fit for the company. Still, that sentiment is rough.Facebook’s top executives frequently made product and policy decisions without consideration for what they might mean in the real world. As another example, the book also explains how Facebook worked to have its service unblocked in Myanmar, something that is widely seen as ultimately leading to genocide. It makes sense that the company would want to have its service online in as many countries as possible, but it overlooked the reality that militants were using the platform to spread anti-Muslim propaganda and incite violence.Trust is your most valuable assetThe result of all of this is that most people don’t trust Facebook, Meta, or Mark Zuckerberg. They don’t trust that the company’s incentives align with their own, or that it will be careful with their information. People use Facebook, but when they really think about it, they don’t trust Facebook. That might be the most important lesson of all: trust is your most valuable asset.When people stop trusting your company, they stop giving you the benefit of the doubt when bad things happen. One telling example of this is Zuckerberg’s explanation of a conversation he had with President Obama warning him about fake news and how it may have influenced the 2016 election. From Wynn-Williams’ account:“Fake news, he kept going on about fake news and misinformation,” Mark steams. “He doesn’t get it. He’s got it totally wrong, totally out of proportion. He said that Facebook’s playing a destructive role globally. And I think he actually believes that.”Of course, Obama believes that because he has seen it play out across the globe. And, the fact that Zuckerberg doesn’t see it is one of the biggest reasons people don’t trust him or the company he leads.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
