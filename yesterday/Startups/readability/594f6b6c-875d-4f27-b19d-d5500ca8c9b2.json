OpenAI has introduced a new way to connect with its popular AI chatbot for U.S. users: Call 1-800-CHATGPT or 1-800-242-8478.OpenAI announced the feature on Wednesday and demonstrated how it works through a YouTube livestream. OpenAI researchers called the number with everything from an iPhone to a flip phone to a landline. No matter the medium, the end output was the same: A female voice saying, \"Hello again, it's ChatGPT, an AI assistant. Our conversation may be reviewed for safety. How can I help you?\"In the live demo, ChatGPT helped identify landmarks that a researcher said he saw on a road trip. In another instance, it provided a different researcher with an English-to-Spanish translation so that she could greet a friend's grandmother in Spanish. The move to have ChatGPT available via phone call is part of the company's goal to make AI \"as accessible as possible to as many people,\" OpenAI product lead Kevin Weil said in the demo video.

Other new features released by the company under the same event include opening up ChatGPT Search for all users, free or paid, and releasing its text-to-video generator Sora to the general public.Related: Is ChatGPT Search Better Than Google?
