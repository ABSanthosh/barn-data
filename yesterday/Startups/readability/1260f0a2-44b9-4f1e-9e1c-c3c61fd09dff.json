If the balance is insufficient, the app will automatically pull funds from a linked bank account, debit card, or credit card. Users will receive email and push notifications a day before a scheduled payment is processed, and they can view upcoming payments or cancel a scheduled payment via the app’s settings page.In addition to sending payments, users can also schedule payment requests by following a similar process. Recipients of a scheduled request will also receive email and push notification reminders the day before the payment is due.AvailabilityThe new scheduling feature is rolling out now and will be widely available to all Venmo users in the coming weeks.Image: VenmoEditor's Picks Joshua Sophy is the Editor for Small Business Trends and has been a member of the team for 16 years.
