Those seemingly glamorous days of hustling and grinding to build and run a business will only get you so far. Case in point: in a recent interview with Inc., Andy Dunn, founder of Bonobos discussed his challenges with leading a company and caring for himself. After a series of eye-opening personal experiences with his health, Dunn realized that a more sustainable approach is necessary for long term success.As a productivity consultant, I regularly advise clients to prioritize their self-care for the wellbeing of themselves and their business. The first 90 days of the year can be helpful for setting strong structures and regular habits that will support your long-term goals.Here’s what you can do to lay down a solid foundation and set yourself up for success throughout the year.Cultivate a self-care mindset. Self-care begins in the mind. What you believe about self-care will ultimately determine the actions you take in both your personal and professional life. Approach self-care from a place of acceptance. There’s no need to struggle or make excuses; self-care is simply a part of your everyday life.It’s just a natural as inhaling and exhaling when you breathe. When you learn to relax into this mindset, you’ll find it easier to take actions that support your wellbeing. Here’s a statement you can use to help you reinforce a more positive mindset, “Prioritizing my self-care supports the wellbeing of myself and my business.” Feel free to create or use your own affirmations to help you strengthen your self-care mindset.Schedule self-care first.Scheduling self-care ensures you’ll have the time and space to sufficiently care for yourself. This strong foundation allows for more sustainable care of your business and your needs for the long term. Plus, it’s easier to schedule self-care than to squeeze it into a jam packed calendar after the fact.Here’s what you should schedule into your calendar at a bare minimum: operating hours of your business, your work start and end hours, lunch and coffee breaks, time spent with family and friends, exercise, hobbies and other personal activities, vacation, personal, and leave time. Remember, you are not taking away from your business by scheduling these items, you are prioritizing your overall wellbeing. Once you’ve scheduled these foundational items, you can then add in the rest of your business and work responsibilities.Your self-care schedule will be inevitably challenged by executive assistants, employees, staff, clients, and vendors. You can offset this by preparing a toolkit of possible solutions well in advance. This way, you’ll at least have some sort of basic plan in hand for challenging scenarios.Here are some ideas you can experiment with both now and in future: Add buffers of time in your schedule to be used for last-minute requests. Anticipate delays by incorporating additional preparation time for projects. Designate a specific point person for off hours or emergency requests. Create modified locations, durations, and formats for recurring meetings. Develop sample schedule scenarios and action steps for your assistant. Protect your self-care schedule.You’ve successfully set up your self-care schedule, the next step is to enforce it. Self-care must be regularly practiced, both consistently and consciously, in order to achieve the best outcome. And every moment of your day affords you an opportunity to hone your skills.It’s important to turn a critical eye to incoming emails, phone calls, messages, texts, postal mail, and interactions with others. This is where you can utilize productivity techniques and tools such as negotiation, delegation, and communication. Does a request overlap or impinge upon your self-care schedule?If yes, negotiate a different set of arrangements or delegate the task to someone else. If no, proceed with your best judgement and decision-making skills. While there will be moments in your business that require late nights or urgent requests, these should be the exception not the norm. Address the issue as needed and get back on track with your regular schedule as soon as possible.Adjust your schedule as needed.Setting a self-care schedule is just part of the process. You must also learn how to adjust your routine as needed. Consciously observe how you are feeling over the next several weeks and months.Are there particular moments in the day when you feel tired or drained? Do certain weeks of the month generate more stress or overwhelm than others? Adjust your schedule as needed to give yourself necessary time to rest and recuperate. You may need to edit, tweak, or remove items in your schedule to come up with the most sustainable scheduling solution for yourself.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",
