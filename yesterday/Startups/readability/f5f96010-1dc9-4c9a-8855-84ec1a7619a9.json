Two-thirds of global energy production is wasted, equating to a staggering $4.5 trillion in economic losses each year, or about five per cent of the world’s GDP, contributing to unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions. Tackling this issue is Tewke, a London-based climate tech startup, which is starting at the use point developing Tap, an intelligent touchscreen light switch that requires no rewiring or smart bulbs. At the heart of Tap is its user-centric design and innovative technology. Unlike traditional smart switches, Tap operates without a neutral wire, making it easy to install in any home. Positioned in the “goldilocks zone” for convenient access, it integrates neuro-symbolic AI systems to optimise energy consumption in real time, ensuring that users benefit from lower bills and a reduced carbon footprint. The switch doubles as a home automation hub, seamlessly managing lighting, heating, and security. What sets Tewke apart is its holistic approach to energy management. “Energy is wasted in homes worldwide due to inefficiencies in how we consume energy,” explains founder Piers Daniell. “This isn’t just an environmental issue – it’s a massive economic opportunity. At Tewke, we’re designing technology that seamlessly integrates into the home, enabling households to adapt to renewable energy cycles while significantly reducing waste.” By turning energy savings into financial gains, Tewke’s solution empowers homeowners to make greener choices without compromising comfort. Having raised £2.6 million in a seed round – more than double its initial target –Tewke is gearing up for its next phase. The funding, which included support from the UK Net Zero Pre-Commercialisation Support Fund, will fuel software development and further refine the AI driving Tap. Tewke’s technology has already earned accolades like the Red Dot Award for Design Concept and the Housing Digital Innovation Award. The company plans to showcase Tap and other innovations at CES 2025 in Las Vegas.
