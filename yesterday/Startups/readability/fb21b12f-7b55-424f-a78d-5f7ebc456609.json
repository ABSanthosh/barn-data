  "text": "You satisfy your customers, but can you satisfy our curiosity? With Mitchell Rodio, Customer Experience Manager at Whop. Please tell us a little bit about your company and what you do there. I‚Äôm a Customer Experience Manager at Whop ‚Äì a digital marketplace for everyone, helping people create a sustainable income online. What word or phrase in customer service jargon should be retired? ‚ÄúI regret to inform you.‚Äù What‚Äôs the most valuable thing that working in customer service has taught you? Having clear communication and empathy can turn even the most frustrated customers into loyal advocates. Describe the essence of great customer service using only three words. Empathy. Efficiency. Communication. What can you do that a bot will never be able to replicate? Being able to talk on an extremely personal level and match users‚Äô tones. Do you identify more with the title ‚Äúcustomer support,‚Äù ‚Äúcustomer service,‚Äù ‚Äúcustomer success,‚Äù or ‚Äúcustomer experience,‚Äù and why? ‚ÄúCustomer success.‚Äù We want all users to come out of a support chat knowing how to make more money on Whop than when they started the chat. What‚Äôs the one piece of advice you would give to your peers in the customer service industry? Customer support jargon is OUT. Users want to talk to a support agent like they‚Äôre talking to a friend. What‚Äôs your greatest productivity hack? Coffee and Notion. What book are you reading at the moment? The Origin of Opportunity by Andrew Cartwright. If customer service was an Olympic sport, what would be the main event? CSAT. What‚Äôs the best thing a customer has ever said to you? Someone recently shared this feedback: ‚ÄúLove this company! Recently, I made $500 in the first seven days of creating my Whop, and the company flew me out to their headquarters in NYC. I met everyone behind the scenes at Whop and they were absolutely phenomenal. I also just had a great customer service experience with Mitch!‚Äù What‚Äôs your most used emoji in customer chats? ü§ù Conversation closed‚Ä¶ for now üòè",
