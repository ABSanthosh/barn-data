  "text": "Employers might want to keep an eye open for any visible facial creases, suspiciously mussed hairdos, or groggy comments during video meetings with remote staff. It turns out nearly half of people working from home admit to taking naps on company time. The sleepy sensation that often hits people after lunch has been around forever, but the spread of pandemic-inspired remote working arrangements has allowed workers to give into those moments of somnolence in ways in-office staff can’t. According to a poll of 1,002 remote and hybrid employees by U.S. mattress maker Amerisleep, 48 percent of respondents said they take naps during their workday. But before employers assemble crack executive teams to battle snoozing on the job, they should know another survey finding. About 53 percent of respondents who copped to workday napping were managers, compared to nearly 48 percent of lower-level employees who similarly fessed up. Why should bosses care if people working remotely fit a little rest time into their day? One reason is that time spent on those cat naps can really add up. Amerisleep’s survey found an average 1.3 hours was spent on siestas during the typical remote work week, which over a year totals nine full 9-to-5 days. That count may increase in the future, given different generational penchants for nodding off during the workday. Nearly 60 percent of Gen-Z employees said they slept on the clock while working remotely, compared to 51 percent of Millennials and 39 percent of Gen-Xers. In addition to age shaping the willingness of people to doze off a bit during the day, the type of jobs held by respondents was also a factor in people’s daytime visits to slumberland. “Marketing and finance professionals topped the list, with 59 percent in each field reporting they nap during the day,” the Amerisleep report on the survey’s findings said. “Hospitality/food (54 percent), education (53 percent), and retail/e-commerce (51 percent) workers weren’t far behind.” Employers might reasonably be outraged at all the snoring taking place on their dime, but many are far from alarmed. In fact, when Amerisleep questioned company executives about it, 36 percent said their companies either encouraged employees to nap during the workday if they feel the need, or else tolerated it without actively promoting the habit. Even businesses without sleeping-on-the-job policies were largely comfortable with the practice—within certain limits. “The majority of managers (73 percent) said they support the idea of employees napping during work hours, as long as they meet their deadlines,” the report said. “While this flexibility might have once seemed radical, it’s becoming a more widely accepted part of remote work life.” So if most employers don’t seem to mind limited napping by remote workers, why should they bother formally addressing it? For starters, 58 percent of snooze-prone employees said they hide that activity from bosses, often scheduling fake meetings on their calendars or using other ruses to appear occupied with do-not-disturb work tasks. When those dodges are discovered—as happened with 10 percent of respondents who said they’d been caught in full snore mode—employers are likely to be angrier about the sneakiness and deception than the actual sleeping. Either way, trust suffers, and resentments can arise. Meanwhile, companies need to gauge the potential and actual consequences of worktime napping on productivity. Contrary to what may seem like intuitive benefits of short rests, respondents who said they grabbed a little shut eye during the day reported feeling lower levels of effectiveness, focus, motivation, and even energy than those who never slept on the job. One reflection of that was the 25 percent of nap fans who said they often struggled to get back into work mode after waking up. Still, there appear to be some advantages to company policies allowing remote employees to catch a few winks as long as they can handle their expected workloads. The survey found 55 percent of workers said they’d feel more loyal to employers who permitted daytime napping. In exchange, sizeable minorities of respondents said they’d be willing to give up certain perks for that permission—including surrendering some of their paid time off, company-supplied food and drinks during in-office days, and team happy hours or social events. What’s the downside for employers who decide they don’t risk productivity dips or missed deadlines by setting company policies allowing remote work napping? They’ll likely have to force themselves to ignore their staff’s occasional groggy eye rubs and flattening of pillow-matted hair during online meetings. The final deadline for the 2025 Inc.
