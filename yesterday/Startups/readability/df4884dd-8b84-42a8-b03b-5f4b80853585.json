And it doesn't cost hundreds of dollars a year or require a personal career coach on speed dial.Right now, you can get a lifetime subscription to a job-search automation platform for just $39 (regularly $599). It's called LoopCV, and it's designed to make job hunting far more efficient for individuals and even entire teams.The traditional job search is exhausting.

It scours more than 30 major job platforms, including LinkedIn, Indeed, Monster, and Glassdoor.
