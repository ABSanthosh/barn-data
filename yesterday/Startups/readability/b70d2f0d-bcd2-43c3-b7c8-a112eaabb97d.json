  "text": "Democrats in Congress are starting to push back against Elon Musk’s incursion into major government systems as the head of Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). A bill introduced Wednesday aims to ban special government employees (SGEs), including Musk, from having federal contracts.House Representative Mark Pocan, a Democrat from Wisconsin, is introducing the pointedly-named Eliminate Looting of Our Nation by Mitigating Unethical State Kleptocracy (ELON MUSK) Act, which proposes requiring federal agencies to terminate any contracts held by SGEs—the same bans that currently apply to members of Congress and other federal employees.There are already existing rules for special government employees, which the White House verified as Musk’s status recently. For instance, SGEs are restricted by federal ethics laws, which make it illegal for any government employees to participate in official matters in which they, their families, or their organizations have a financial interest. There are also conflict-of-interest restrictions, and most have to file financial disclosure forms, though Musk has seemingly sidestepped this by choosing to take no salary.“No one should have the ability to direct funds towards their personal interest if they are working for the federal government,” Pocan said in a statement. “No government employee, ‘Special’ or not, should have any financial interest in who the government does business with. Elon Musk is the poster child for this type of potential abuse. After more than $20 billion in federal contracts, there’s no way Musk can be objective in what he’s doing.”Pocan’s bill has a slim chance of getting anywhere in Congress, where Republicans hold a majority in both the House and Senate, but it’s just one of several recent attempts to slow Musk down.In his role as head of DOGE, though, Musk has sewn chaos throughout at least half-a-dozen government branches, with many questioning the legality of his moves.“[DOGE] has no authority to make spending decisions, to shut down programs or ignore federal law. This is not debatable. This is an indisputable fact. No authority for spending decisions to shut down programs or ignore federal law,” Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said Tuesday.Since Donald Trump took office, DOGE has reportedly taken control of government systems that house sensitive personal information about millions of Americans, and begun the process of displacing hundreds of thousands of civil servants. Many have criticized how DOGE is going about this, using private email addresses and breaking laws that guide government agencies.Musk has responded with allegations that the government itself is violating the law in many instances, calling foreign assistance division USAID, for instance, a “criminal organization” that should be shut down. Without presenting evidence, he posted Tuesday on X claiming that nearly 10 percent of federal government disbursements, totaling roughly $700 billion per year, were “fraud.”It’s possible that Trump could give Musk a written waiver from some of the regulations around SGEs, according to a report in The New York Times. It’s not clear whether he has or not, but Musk has not slowed his rapid pace of infiltrating federal agencies, working late hours and weekends, and even reportedly moving beds into the federal personnel office, letting him and his team sleep there. (That could work against him. The Congressional Research Service says SGEs are limited to working not “more than 130 days during any period of 365 days.”)Pocan’s bill is the latest in a volley of attempts to slow Musk down. There have already been numerous lawsuits filed, including one from federal employee unions attempting to block Musk’s access to the Treasury payments system. On Tuesday, meanwhile, House and Senate Democrats introduced a bill meant to block Musk’s “unlawful access” to that same system. (Like Pocan’s legislation, that bill is unlikely to pass.)While Republicans have been standing back from criticizing the extent of Musk’s (and DOGE’s) reach, that solidarity might be beginning to crack somewhat. Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) told reporters Wednesday, “There’s no doubt that the president appears to have empowered Elon Musk far beyond what I think is appropriate. I think a lot of it is going to end up in court.”",
