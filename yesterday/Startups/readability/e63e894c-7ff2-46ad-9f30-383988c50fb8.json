  "text": "Wind gusts of 30 miles per hour would challenge any golfer, but Rory McIlroy credits his mental preparation for calming his nerves and making it possible for him to win the 2025 Players Championship. In a 29-minute press conference after his victory in a Monday playoff, McIlroy gave a master class on the mental game. Although he was talking about golf, you can apply McIlroy’s “learning journey” to manage anxiety and build confidence in high-pressure situations like public speaking. 1. Practice and prepare for real-world conditions. McIlroy talked reporters through his mental and practice routine for the three-hole playoff. “Standing over that tee shot on 16 this morning was the most nervous I’ve been in a long time,” McIlroy admitted. Anyone who’s felt anxious before giving a presentation can relate to what he said next: “Your stomach’s not feeling great. Your legs are a little shaky. Your heart rate is racing.” Yes, even champions at McIlroy’s level get nervous, so they put in the mental work to keep their composure. McIlroy calmed his nerves by practicing the shots he’d take on the course. For example, he hit extra drives to simulate the first swing off the tee. He also practiced hitting balls into the wind to prepare for the famed—and notorious—island green on the 17th hole. The local Ponte Vedra newspaper called conditions “hateful, horrible, hideous, and really hard.” McIlroy hit the green on 17 while his competitor hit his ball into the water.  “We play an outdoor sport, and you’re going to have to contend with the wind,” said McIlroy, referring to a loss at the Master’s last year, when he “didn’t have enough shots to contend with the gusts.” He built his confidence over time by practicing in the wind to small targets.  In a similar way, it’s natural to feel anxious before a big pitch or presentation. The key to calming your nerves is to put in the work ahead of time, practicing your presentation over and over in real-world conditions.   For example, deliver your presentation from start to finish in front of a friend or peer. If your presentation will be on stage, find a stage to practice on. Get used to how you’ll feel when it comes time to perform. You can’t perform your best under pressure unless you’ve practiced under pressure. 2. Reframe and replace. “I was as nervous as I could remember,” McIlroy repeated several times during the press conference. “There are a lot of thoughts racing through your head. I was a little anxious.” Sound familiar? Champions like McIlroy face the same mental challenges as you do. To calm his jitters, McIlroy uses a technique called reframe and replace. First, reframe the way you feel. Pressure, for example, isn’t a bad thing. “Pressure is a privilege. It’s a good thing,” McIlroy said. Second, replace negative thoughts with positive ones. McIlroy says everyone has negative thoughts. “As I was walking from the 16th green to 17th tee today, I could see myself hitting into the water. It’s something that crosses your mind.” McIlroy doesn’t try to stop the negative thoughts from entering his mind. That’s futile. But when those thoughts pop up, he drowns them out by replacing them with more positive ones. “You have to try really hard to make those positive thoughts just a little stronger and a little more powerful than the negative ones,” he said. For public speakers it’s also crucial to reframe pressure. You have the privilege of sharing your ideas, and pressure is an inevitable result of success. And those negative thoughts? They’ll come, often at the worst time, like just before you begin to speak. The secret is to drown out negative thoughts with positive images of yourself speaking confidently and engaging the audience. 3. Learn from mistakes. McIlroy’s win at the 2025 Players Championship comes after he’d had several big disappointments in the previous season. McIlroy said, “We’ve all had periods in our life when we’ve had our hearts broken. We all have to go through it. It’s a part of the learning journey. And ultimately, those are the days that make us better.” Instead of allowing those disappointments to get him down, McIlroy doubled down on the work, the practice, and trusted that continuous improvement would lead to victory. For public speakers, mistakes and disappointments are also learning opportunities. If you didn’t get the desired outcome from your last presentation, figure out why and put in the work to improve next time. Learn, sharpen, and improve. You might have the skills required to succeed in your business, but if you don’t master the mental game, you’ll fail to reach your full potential.
