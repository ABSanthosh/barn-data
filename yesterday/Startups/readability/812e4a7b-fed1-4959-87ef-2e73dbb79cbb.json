  "text": "Ryan Reynolds has always loved commercials. They’re a quick, impactful form of storytelling. And if a spot doesn’t hit, that’s OK. It’s just a commercial, Reynolds told attendees Friday at the Inc. 5000 Conference in Palm Desert, California. Reynolds was joined onstage by Mark Douglas, founder, president, and CEO of the Austin-based advertising software company MNTN, which acquired Reynolds’s marketing company Maximum Effort in 2021. The two businesses were a natural fit, as MNTN was on a “mission to democratize TV advertising, make it accessible to essentially any size brand and bring it on a par with search and social,” Douglas said. The two companies agreed to a merger after just three days of negotiations, with Reynolds becoming chief creative officer of MNTN.“I asked to be admiral,” Reynolds joked. “That’s not a title at a business—yet.” There’s obvious synergy: MNTN (pronounced “mountain”) helps companies—particularly small and midsize businesses—target television ads to potential customers effectively. Maximum Effort, the marketing company Reynolds founded with George Dewey in 2018, was known for quirky, of-the-moment ads.  Take an ad Maximum Effort created at the end of 2020 for the dating website Match.com. In the commercial, Satan matches with someone on the dating app, a woman who introduces herself as “2020” (as in the year). Their romance plays out set to Taylor Swift’s song “Love Story.” Reynolds calls spots like this “fastvertising” ads “moving at or close to the speed of culture—they are sticky and they grab attention very, very quickly,” he said. “I personally find it hard to emotionally invest in a commercial that is trying to trick me into emotionally investing.” In other words, a great ad can be nothing more than entertaining and of the moment.  “A lot of companies are thinking, how do we create an ad that will one day flicker across the screens in the Smithsonian?” he added. “It doesn’t work like that.” In fact, some of the best ads can come together quickly and winkingly lean into the fact that they’re selling something. “Too much time and too much money will murder creativity,” Reynolds said.Douglas noted that as more TV viewers turn to ad-supported streaming, MNTN is positioned to help businesses reach more consumers. The company has partnered with OpenAI among others on a targeting technology that uses generative AI to help brands match with the best possible customers to advertise to. While rumors have swirled about a potential IPO in MNTN’s future, both Douglas and Reynolds declined to comment on the matter, with Douglas saying only, “That sounds exciting,” and Reynolds adding, “I was going to say nothing, Mark. Nothing at all.” Brands Reynolds works with do tend to pop, particularly those he’s invested in. Aviation Gin, founded by Christian Krogstad and Ryan Magarian, got a boost when Reynolds came on as part owner and a regular face in its ads in 2018: It sold to Tanqueray owner Diageo two years later for $610 million. In 2019, Reynolds became part owner and the face of discount mobile carrier Mint, which T-Mobile acquired for up to $1.35 billion in May.  And of course, as a “part-time actor,” Reynolds recently starred in and produced the latest installment of the wildly successful Deadpool series. “I really wanted to have some authorship in how the story’s told,” Reynolds said. If it didn’t do well, he reasoned, “at least I had some authorship in what happened.” Of course, in the end it did “very, very well,” with Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine grossing $1.3 billion worldwide.  Earlier: With 13 Words, Ryan Reynolds Just Exploded a Huge Myth About Creativity and Success",
