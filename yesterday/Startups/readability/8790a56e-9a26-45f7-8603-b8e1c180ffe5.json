  "text": "The holiday season is fast approaching, and while some have already begun their purchasing, many wait until the most notorious shopping day of the year: Black Friday. Preparing your business for Black Friday can seem like a monumental undertaking, but we’ve collected eight suggestions to help you. Discover how to navigate the busy day with these expert-tested strategies.1. Implement daily flash sales.Instead of focusing all your energy on the big day, you can shift to daily deals leading up to Black Friday, which will spread demand for production teams. Take it from Michael Nemeroff, the CEO and co-founder of RushOrderTees, a Pennsylvania-based custom T-shirt company, who says, “One year, we decided to separate deals into daily flash sales rather than spread smaller discounts across every product line.” Nemeroff continues, “We released new daily sales in the week leading up to Black Friday to make our sales more accessible. With shifting daily deals, we spread demand for our production team and encouraged customers to try a new line at a heavily discounted rate.”A great way to reduce the stress that can accompany Black Friday shopping is to start promotions early. “We know that many shoppers are looking for deals before Black Friday even starts, so we start rolling out our Black Friday sale prices early—even though there are still weeks until the event starts,” says Breanna Hendry, social-media marketing director for Minky Couture, a designer blanket company from Utah.“This tactic helps us capture early shoppers who are eager to get a head start on their holiday shopping, helping us to drive sales before the rush of Black Friday starts,” Hendry explains. “It also creates excitement and urgency, as customers feel they’re getting exclusive deals ahead of time.”3. Create bundle deals.“I’ve found that creating bundle deals is a highly effective strategy for Black Friday,” says Matthew Kinneman, the founder of Pennsylvania performance dog food company Bully Max. “By offering curated bundles of our best-selling products, we not only simplify the buying process for customers but also enhance their perceived value.” This tactic increased sales while allowing customers to try multiple products at a discount. Kinneman adds: “Promoting these bundles through targeted marketing campaigns created excitement and urgency, driving traffic to our website. Bundling not only maximized our sales on Black Friday but also fostered customer loyalty by demonstrating our commitment to providing value.”4. Offer exclusive early access.While it’s important to drive new traffic, your current customers are often the best place to focus your efforts. According to Maya Smith, founder and CEO of The Doux, an online hair product company, “One of the strategies that’s worked well for us is focusing on connecting with our customers early and offering them something special.” Smith elaborates, “We like to create excitement by giving our loyal customers first access to exclusive deals through email and social media. By taking a customer-first approach to Black Friday, we not only exceed our customers’ expectations but also show them how much we truly value their loyalty.”5. Logistically prepare in advance.Black Friday traffic may require advanced logistical preparation to ensure you can meet demand. Lenny Chase, CEO of Rasa, a Colorado company that sells adaptogenic coffee alternatives, says his company begins its Black Friday planning months ahead.“We painstakingly examine past sales data, industry trends, and customer comments,” Chase says. “This enables us to deliberately raise our stock levels so that we have enough of our best-selling blends. We modernized our inventory-control system to provide real-time stock level visibility from every one of our sites. This has been absolutely vital in helping us to prevent stockouts and enable rapid inventory redistribution, if necessary.”6. Optimize for mobile traffic.Many Black Friday shoppers will access deals from their phones while they hit stores in person, so your website must be mobile-friendly. Reilly James, marketing manager for William Morris Wallpaper, knows the importance of this: “We enhanced our on-site experience by optimizing for mobile, since more than half of our traffic on Black Friday comes through smartphones.” James explains: “We ran a series of heatmap tests, and through those insights, redesigned important navigation elements to ensure users can find exactly what they’re looking for with fewer clicks.”7. Deploy live-support bots.Stressed out Black Friday shoppers are generally going to need more support than your usual customers. Therefore, it’s important for your customer service team to be all-hands-on-deck—potentially with some extra support from technology. “One of the strategies we’ve used during Black Friday is a live customer-support bot coupled with AI product recommendations,” says Jason Stelle, head of SEO at Filterbuy, an air-filter manufacturer in Alabama. “We were actually able to take the pressure off our customer-service team to attend to more technical queries and issues. Most importantly, customers are happy with the quick replies and individual recommendations, which increase the conversion rates.” 8. Use a tease-and-hype strategy.“We start by teasing the sale with subtle, curiosity-driven content on social media and email, dropping hints without giving too much away,” says Claire Bradbourne, global CMO for Auckland, New Zealand-based non-alcoholic cocktail company Free AF. “This helps create early awareness and gets people talking before the big event, especially as there are many promos out there.”As the big day gets closer, the company shifts into the hype phase to drive anticipation and boost intent, with tactics like sneak peeks, influencer shout-outs, and paid ads across different platforms. Bradbourne concludes, “Finally, we go all-in with the announcement. Bold, clear messaging is pushed across all channels, from paid media to organic posts, making sure our audience knows it’s time to take action.”The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",
