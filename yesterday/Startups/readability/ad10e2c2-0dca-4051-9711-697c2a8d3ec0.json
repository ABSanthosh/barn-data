  "text": "At 19, Teddy Warner has already tried a lot of things. He worked in a fabrication lab in his home state of North Carolina, studied at the University of Southern California for a year before dropping out, and spent several months at research lab and generative AI program Midjourney, working as a hardware engineer.Now, he’s tackling what he views as a key problem with human-robot interactions: expression, or a robot’s lack thereof. “Robots currently go from A to C—that is observation to action,” says Warner. But humans, he notes, also have an “intermediary B step.” That B step, as Warner sees it, involves a physiological response that can encompass everything from shifting emotions and sweating to changes in blood circulation.“This B step is quite important,” he says.Warner started Intempus in 2024 as a research project to simulate that physiological state for existing robots, and smooth interactions between humans and their mechanical sidekicks. Perhaps that’s a Roomba-style vacuum cleaner that “gets nippy” like a small dog when its way is blocked, or even a mechanical arm at use in a factory. He incorporated Intempus in January of this year.Warner says part of his goal includes helping a robot determine how much computing power to use and when. If, for example, a robot fails its task, which Warner says is “the robot’s equivalent of stress,” it should use as much compute as possible to address the issue and “to concoct a little dynamic expression, a little movement to convey to humans, ‘Hey, help me out.’ ”Intempus founder Teddy Warner. Photo: Courtesy subjectFor Warner, simulating a physiological state for robots that comes between an observation and reaction is the key both to helping humans understand robots better through innate communication and to helping robots “understand” the world and their own internal operations.Although facial expressions are crucial for human-to-human communication, Warner says positioning of the torso, shoulders, and arms is more important. As humanoid robots are not mainstream yet, Warner aims to use Intempus’s technology to retrofit existing robots in whatever form they come with physiological movement to convey expression.“You can make non-anthropomorphic robots convey expression or their intent as easily as you can an anthropomorphic robot on the merit that it’s all chest- and torso-based,” he says.After founding Intempus, Warner spent the first four months doing research, which included capturing physiological data from humans via sweat, body temperature, heart rate, and volumetric changes in circulating blood and assessing how the data relates to emotions. He says the research is ongoing.And as of last week, Warner received a $200,000 Thiel Fellowship to move the company forward. For now, Warner is the founder, CEO, and sole staffer at Intempus, but he’s focused on hiring to build out the team to help him realize his goal of making Intempus the standard bearer when it comes to interaction between robots and humans within a decade.Already, Warner is fielding interest in Intempus. He says he has received letters of intent from seven initial partners in the robotics industry.The super early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, May 30, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
