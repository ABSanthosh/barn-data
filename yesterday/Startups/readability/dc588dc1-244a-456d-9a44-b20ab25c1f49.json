Spotted: Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the dangers and wastefulness of fast fashion, but that isn’t slowing the volume of clothes that get sent to landfill. The world currently generates 92 million tonnes of textile waste a year, and that’s likely to reach 134 million by 2030. What if we could turn that waste into something useful? UK-based startup Fab Materials uses its proprietary technology to take end-of-life textile waste and transform it into new, value-added construction boards and composites. The boards can then be used in construction and furniture, as well as for other design and display purposes. As well as making use of waste, the technology also reduces demand for fresh wood materials, which could help to limit harmful deforestation. According to the company, its textile-based material can be used as a direct drop-in replacement for the existing virgin wood used in traditional medium-density fibreboard (MDF). The technology is also compatible with existing recycling processes, meaning it could quickly and easily be implemented to slow the wave of old clothes currently being sent to landfills around the world. Recently, Fab Materials won the top pitch, led by Founder and CEO John Somerville, at Undaunted’s flagship Greenhouse Demo Day. The event follows a year-long Greenhouse accelerator programme, where Fab Materials received £20k equity-free grant funding along with resources, training, and valuable networking opportunities.
