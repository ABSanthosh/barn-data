I’ve got a handful of events left in Boulder before Amy and I head to Aspen for the summer.6/5: Denver: Techstars Workforce Development Demo Day + Give First with Brad Feld6/10: Boulder: CoinGeek Startup Spotlight: From Entrepreneur to Enterprise6/12: Boulder: New Tech ft. Give First Fireside Chat w/ Brad FeldFor the past two days, I was in Indianapolis at the Global Entrepreneurship Congress 2025. The last time I was at GEC was in Rio de Janeiro in 2013. Even then, I was talking about Give Before You Get, a concept I had introduced in Startup Communities: Building an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem in Your City, which I wrote in 2012. And, I had longer hair. In addition to a panel and a keynote, I reconnected with many people around the world who work on startup communities, some of whom have been long-time friends (Andy, Victor, and Lesa – I’m looking at you). I had several great conversations with Jonathan Ortmans, the CEO of GEN, and I’m incredibly proud to be associated with the fantastic work he has done over the past 20+ years. I recorded several podcasts in the recording studio that Silver Foxx Media set up, which will soon be dropping on the Give First Podcast.And, I spent a wonderful evening at High Alpha with Scott Dorsey and 150 of their closest friends. Mollie Kuramoto on their team wrote a lovely long-form post about our fireside chat: Give First: Insights from Our Fireside Chat with Brad Feld. I loved Molly’s final words on our discussion, which included:Brad closed the evening with reflections on life’s finite nature and the importance of living with intention. “This is the moment,” he shared. “Life is full of challenges, heartbreak, and failure, but it’s also filled with opportunity. Focus on what matters to you. Define your own meaning. And don’t miss the chance to contribute to something greater.”I’ve decided to mix metaphors and turn into a pumpkin at midnight on Halloween and go back into hibernation for an indeterminate amount of time on November 1st. I turn 60 on December 1st, and I want to spend at least a few months experiencing that and fully embracing my entrance into what Amy and I call “the third third of life.” Until then, I’m having a great time being out and about in the world again.",
