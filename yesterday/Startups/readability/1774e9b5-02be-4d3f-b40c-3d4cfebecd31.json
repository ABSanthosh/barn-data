  "link": "",
  "description": "Feeling the impact of eggflation? Vital Farms’ CEO Russell Diez-Canseco joins Rapid Response to offer valuable context beyond the eye-popping price tags. As avian flu continues to wipe out millions of birds, many egg producers are struggling — but Vital Farms has managed to keep growing. Canseco shares how the brand’s relationship with farmers, transparency with customers, and unique business model has allowed the company to turn crisis into opportunity. He also explores why Vital Farms became a B Corp before its IPO, the company’s high-profile lawsuit with PETA, and what makes Vital Farms’ yolks so orange. Visit the Rapid Response website here: https://www.rapidresponseshow.com/See Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
