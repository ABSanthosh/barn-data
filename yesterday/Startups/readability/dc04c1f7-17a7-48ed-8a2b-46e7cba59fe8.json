  "text": "A Wyoming-based startup just broke ground on a next-generation wind farm—and its modular turbines could be cheaper, faster to build, and more efficient than today’s pinwheel-shaped turbines. Airloom’s turbines don’t look much like the giant pinwheels that have become standard in the wind industry today—they much more closely resemble a roller coaster. “With growing electricity needs, we need more flexible systems that can be built quickly, and deployed anywhere at large scale,” Airloom CEO Neal Rickner said in a statement. “That’s the only way we’re going to achieve and maintain energy security and independence. Airloom’s proprietary, U.S.-manufactured turbines do just that—replacing bulky, costly models with low-cost compact designs that generate more energy in less space.” Airloom Energy broke ground on a site near Rock River, Wyoming, where it will build its first utility-scale turbine. The company says it is on track to complete the build and begin commercial demonstrations in 2027. There it will test its next-generation, modular turbine design in order to validate power, ensure efficiency of production and refine the cost of deployment, according to a company announcement. Airloom’s turbine structure is only about 60 feet high, according to TechCrunch, which Airloom says is beneficial for deploying in sites with less wind or height restrictions. (Wind turbines have grown about 83 percent since the late ‘90s, and some on land today sit on towers close to 340 feet high with rotor diameters of more than 400 feet.) It consists of a series of poles arranged in a large oval that hold up a track. Fixed blades or wings move around the track when blown by the wind, generating mechanical force.  Because of its modular formation, Airloom’s turbines are expected to capture more wind and generate more power, using less space, and can be built using small, mass-produced parts that can be manufactured domestically. Airloom Energy says its turbines can be installed in under one year and last about 30 years. The company also says its design can remedy the difficulties of manufacturing traditional horizontal-axis wind turbines, which are very expensive to manufacture. “This pilot is more than a test site; it’s the beginning of a fundamentally new approach to resilient renewable energy generation: wind energy that’s faster to deploy, land-efficient, and built for the energy challenges ahead,” Paul Judge, former head of product management at GE Onshore Wind and advisory board member for Airloom, said in a statement. Airloom Energy has raised about $13.75 million in funding from a combination of sources including from Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, WYVC, Crosscut Ventures, WovenEarth Ventures, and more. Of that, $5 million came from Energy Matching Funds via the State of Wyoming and $1.25 million came from a Department of Defense contract. The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is this Friday, June 27, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
