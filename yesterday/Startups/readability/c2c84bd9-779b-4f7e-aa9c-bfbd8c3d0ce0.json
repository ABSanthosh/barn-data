  "text": "The Minority Business Development Agency is the latest federal organization to be gutted by the Trump administration. The White House terminated funding for multiple MBDA business centers late last week.Numerous MBDA business centers received e-mails last Thursday notifying them that the agency was axing their federal grants immediately, explaining that the funding doled out was “no longer consistent with the agency’s priorities and no longer serves the interest of the United States and the MBDA program.” The MBDA did not respond to Inc.’s request for comment. The MBDA was created in 1969 by Republican President Richard Nixon to bolster growth of minority-owned businesses and help level the playing field to address economic inequality.  Since its creation, the agency has become a force in helping minority-owned companies find new sources of capital and federal contracts. During President Joe Biden’s term, the agency helped create more than 23,000 jobs and assisted minority enterprises in securing more than $3.2 billion worth of contracts.The business center serving Louisiana was told that its funding was being yanked because the MBDA is “repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction,” one that aligns with the executive order President Trump issued in March. That order directed a handful of agencies—including the MBDA—to be pared back to their statutory function, or the most basic powers laid out for agency under the law. That said, business centers are considered statutory under the Minority Business Development Act of 2021.The termination notice was sent via e-mail from Nate Cavanaugh–who has been linked to DOGE–under the authority of Keith Sanderling, the acting undersecretary of the MBDA, according to a letter verified by Inc. Since it was opened in July 2021, the Louisiana center worked with several hundred companies throughout the state, advising entrepreneurs on everything from securing new lines of capital to forming partnerships with largest private sector companies.“We had a conference planned for this year that was going to be an opportunity to provide more training and offer a matchmaking event where businesses could meet with others located in the New Orleans area to identify any potential contract opportunities,” said Charletta Fortson, the program director at the Louisiana MBDA Business Center.  “We were able to connect socially and economically disadvantaged businesses to different resources, and that resource is essentially terminated as of April 17.” The center has now shuttered, though Fortson said that there may be an opportunity for some centers to reposition themselves and the services they offer, depending on how their grants were structured. There were at least 38 MBDA business centers, per the agency’s webpage, though it’s unclear how many have since shut down.  Some are even choosing to fight back. Diane Sumpter, the president and CEO of DESA Inc., which is the operator of the South Carolina MBDA center, plans to keep serving minority-owned companies throughout South Carolina until June 30 of this year. That’s the end date of the contract DESA has in serving the center.“To do any less would violate South Carolina citizens who depend on us,” Sumpter says.As an entrepreneur who has worked in the sector for decades, Sumpter said that she is not taking the e-mail seriously because she has not received an official termination notice signed by officials similar to the MBDA contract that she received. She adds that she views the administration’s actions as an “assault on everything minority.”  And not every center has received a termination notice. The business center serving Indiana confirmed that it had not been contacted by the MBDA about a funding cutoff. There are reportedly other centers that have not received the notices, though Inc. was unable to independently verify individual statuses by time of publication. The loss of the business centers follows recent layoffs that have whittled away the agency’s employees. Staffers at the MBDA’s headquarters in Washington D.C. reportedly received termination notices en masse, prompting attention from three Democratic lawmakers late last week. Earlier in April, it was reported that at least 32 staffers had been laid off, but the scope might have been larger than realized.A spokesperson for Small Business Majority, a business advocacy organization based in Washington D.C., tells Inc. that they “heard from multiple sources that MBDA in DC has only one staffer remaining.” At its full capacity, the agency operated with about 100 employees. Sens. Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-PA) demanded answers from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in a joint letter criticizing the Commerce Department for circumventing Congress in the gutting of the MBDA. ”Information provided to our offices makes clear the [reduction in force] your Department initiated at the MBDA was even more sweeping than we had feared, leaving the agency with effectively no staff,” the lawmakers wrote to Lutnick. “Your Department appears to have dismantled the MBDA without any act of Congress—disregarding the programs and initiatives the Administration is directed by statute to implement.”The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
