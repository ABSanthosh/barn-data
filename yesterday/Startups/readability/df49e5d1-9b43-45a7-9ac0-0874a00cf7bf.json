  "text": "With Election Day less than two weeks away and polls showing Kamala Harris losing a bit of ground in polls (though the race remains virtually tied), the vice president and Democratic presidential candidate sat down recently with billionaire entrepreneur and investor Mark Cuban to discuss policies around the economy and entrepreneurship in a YouTube video published Wednesday evening. But this was no trip to the Shark Tank for Harris.Cuban is an ardent supporter of Harris in 2024—and the video is more a conversation than a debate of the issues. It is, in many ways, a Democratic version of the Trump-Musk interview that took place in August. Cuban has been very vocal about his view that Harris’s economic policies are better for business owners. He has been equally outspoken about his problems with Trump’s economic plans, calling the proposal to raise tariffs “a tax on everybody” and writing on X that “[Trump’s] lack of understanding of business is insane.” Influencers have become a critical part of this election cycle. Harris, earlier, appeared on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast, which has a large female audience. Trump, meanwhile, has appeared on Barstool Sports and Impaulsive with Logan Paul—and will tape an interview Friday with podcaster and UFC color commentator Joe Rogan. (Rogan’s podcast has a reach of 17.5 million subscribers on YouTube and 14 million on Spotify.)Cuban and Harris’ conversation, filmed on Oct. 17 in Wisconsin, where Cuban appeared at a Harris rally, saw the duo talk about everything from the economy to entrepreneurship. Here are some of the top takeaways from the discussion. 1. Kamala Harris is actively courting the entrepreneur voteMuch of the conversation was spent focusing on entrepreneurs and the benefits they would have under the Harris economic plan. The $6,000 tax credit she has proposed, for instance, would help founders have a better work/life balance, the two suggested. Harris spoke about innovation and looked to position herself as having qualities similar to an entrepreneur as well, saying “You can’t be a successful entrepreneur without thinking about where things are going.” She also said of business owners who were willing to put it all on the line: “It’s that energy and that grit that is going to spur us into the future.”“The idea of knowing it is possible for us, if we work and study something, [to] create something that improves and uplifts the human condition? That excites me to no end,” Harris told Cuban. “That’s where I see we can combine our areas of interest.”2. Mark Cuban attacked the idea that Donald Trump is better for businessWhile Harris may have been the host and the focus of the discussion, Cuban spent a lot more time talking—and he had a lot of thoughts about Trump.Saying he had known Trump for 25 years, Cuban wasted no time attacking Trump’s policies on tariffs, likening Trump to “the Grinch who stole Christmas.” Cuban said that if Trump follows through on his high tariff threats (Trump has proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China — and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the United States imports), families hoping to buy presents for friends and loved ones next December will not be able to afford all of the things they want.Cuban also said tariffs would hurt entrepreneurs, “Those small companies that support communities, not only does their cost go up, but their businesses will just shut [down]. He is going to put who knows how many small businesses out of business.”He also implied Trump has never had a real entrepreneurial experience, after Harris stated that Trump was “handed so much of what he had – and has lost it.” Cuban added: “I don’t think he’s ever run a company where you have to go deal with the fundamental basis of your business. He has no clue. And the worst part is, he doesn’t care.”3. Mark Cuban’s interview of Harris felt very different from Musk and TrumpWhile Trump and Musk talked for more than two hours on X (after glitches resulted in a 35-minute delay to the stream starting), Cuban and Harris kept their conversation brief and focused. It felt more slickly produced and edited. The conversation lasted just over six minutes – and while Cuban and Harris covered a number of topics, they didn’t dwell.The two conversations also showcased the drawing power of X (formerly Twitter) despite its much-cataloged problems over the past few years. Over 1 million people listened to Trump and Musk simultaneously during their talk. The audience for Cuban and Harris on YouTube was under 2,000 for the live premiere.",
