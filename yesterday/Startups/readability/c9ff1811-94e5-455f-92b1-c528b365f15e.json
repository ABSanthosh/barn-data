A New Report Calls These 10 Careers 'AI-Proof'Galloway says he now uses AI more as a \"thought partner\" than a writer. He consults AI for information, asks it to create a pitch deck, and prompts it to ask him questions like an investor based on the pitch deck. AI doesn't replace the tasks Galloway has to do; it augments them.\"What I would say is just start using [AI], and your own mind will start figuring out ways you can incorporate it,\" Galloway said. \"You're the warrior. This is a weapon, but you're the warrior.\" Scott Galloway.
