Chocolate may be delicious, but manufacturing it can also be extremely wasteful, with around 75 per cent of the cacao pod discarded during cocoa production. Blue Stripes, an innovative food brand founded by renowned chocolate connoisseur Oded Brenner, hopes to change that. Blue Stripes’ primary mission is to reduce the cacao waste generated by the chocolate manufacturing industry. To do this, it has developed a range of innovative products that are made from the other parts of cacao to harness the nutritional value and flavour of the whole fruit. These products include antioxidant-rich water, as well as whole-pod chocolate bars, granola, and beans. Climate change has compromised cacao yields in recent yields, putting pressure on local farmers who rely on the crop for income. Because Blue Stripe’s innovative approach allows farmers to get more value out of the entire cacao plant, including the beans, shells, and fruit, it enables them to maintain a steady income even during lower-yield harvests. Last month, Blue Stripes successfully closed a $20 million series B funding round, led by Zintinus, The Hershey Company, and Whole Foods Market, this investment will fuel the brand’s growth. Blue Stripes plans to expand its product line and raise awareness about sustainable chocolate practices and the numerous benefits of the cacao fruit.
