  "text": "June 5, 2025 10:49 AM Image Credit: Google/Roblox Google announced today that it is launching a new experience in Roblox — specifically, an experience based around its Play Points rewards system. The playable experience offers an immersive obstacle course and several rewards, both digital and physical, as well as several mini-games and a VIP vault exclusively for Diamond, Gold and Platinum members. The Diamond District experience is available starting today through July 2. Players can access the Diamond District’s features by linking Google Play Point account with Roblox. The experience follows on an update that allows users to redeem Play Points for exclusive items within Roblox, and now Google Play holds an exclusive space within the platform. Play Points members can acquire digital rewards within the Diamond District’s rewards, such as headphones and gliders themed after the glittering Play diamond logo. Jackie Titus, director of Google Play’s activations and engagement, told GamesBeat in an interview, “Building off of the success from last year, we want to continue to level-up our rewards program this year with exclusive perks and experiences that truly delight and reward our most valuable members… To build on that momentum in 2025, we set out to create something our members can enjoy all over the world that would place us directly within a vibrant gaming environment that would delight them. And as we dug deeper into the content our audience loves, Roblox quickly rose to the top.” In addition to the core experience, the Diamond District also offers physical rewards for Play Points members, including a custom Google Play x Backbone One controller and a limited edition gift box. Over the next week, users have access to merch from other companies, such as Duolingo’s Duo owl plushie. Titus said of the rewards, “Rewarding our members in many ways is at the core of our program. With Roblox being a completely digital experience we knew it was special and noteworthy to create tangible collectibles that represent the world of our Diamond District.” Titus added, “From the beginning this experience has been meticulously crafted with our members at its very core. Our creative process began with how we can convey our commitment to be the most rewarding program, delighting our members at every turn…. Our creative process started back in January with early ideation on how our Roblox world could tie into our larger brand campaign. The process was pretty hands on from the beginning. It involved many workshops, custom backend builds, new functionality and testing sessions all the way through launch.”",
