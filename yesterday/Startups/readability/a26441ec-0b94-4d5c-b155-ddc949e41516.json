  "text": "It’s rare to land a conversation with Sir Richard Branson, especially when he’s invited to join a Zoom call from Necker, his personal island. But Branson gladly joined me and Jason Felts, former head of Virgin’s entertainment and production arm, and author of the new book, Hollywood Virgin (Wiley, 2025).Felts shared key lessons he learned from Branson, his mentor. Watching and listening to Felts and Branson share insights about their 20-year friendship and professional partnership was like attending an advanced class in entrepreneurship—but a lot more fun.1. Insatiable curiosityFelts had co-founded a movie production company before he met Branson for the first time at a Necker event. He knew little about Branson at the time, but over a few days, Branson—a keen observer—learned plenty about Felts.Felts vividly remembers when Branson shoved glassware aside and coaxed Felts to stand on a dinner table, and tell the other guests about his production company. “What intrigued me was that he [Felts] didn’t just talk about his accomplishments,” Branson recalls. “Instead, he envisioned the future of entertainment. He was much more interested in talking about what’s possible than what happened in the past. We had that in common.”Within a year, the billionaire asked Felts to start a Virgin production company. Felts agreed and became the youngest CEO to ever run a Virgin brand—with the exception of Branson himself.Felts developed short and long-form content, including blockbuster movies like “Limitless” and groundbreaking projects like the now-famous Virgin America safety video, which went viral for its fun, innovation, and creativity.Felts credits much of his success to one key trait he learned from Branson: insatiable curiosity.Branson met Felts at one of the many events and gatherings he holds on Necker to learn new things from innovators and interesting people. “I love talking to all the guests on the one-to-one because I’m learning all the time from them,” Branson said.“The more you learn, the more useful you can be.”While Felts had always loved to “ask a billion questions,” Branson took learning to a new level. Felts had captured Branson’s attention because he taught the Virgin founder to think differently about how content could align and elevate all the Virgin companies. And Branson is always eager to learn from his guests.2. Attentive listeningIn one remarkable exchange during my conversation with Felts and his mentor, Felts picked up his notebook where he jots down ideas. Branson stepped away from the camera to pick up his notebook, which is always nearby.This practice of notetaking had once made an impression on me. I picked up my notebook sitting on my desk—a habit I credit to Branson, too.Branson always carries a notebook because a genuinely curious person constantly asks questions and really listens to the answers. Attentive listeners write down what they hear before they forget. You never know when a short note contains the seed of a big idea.3. Being present Felts told me about a memorable White House visit with Branson to meet then-President Barack Obama. Branson handed Felts a “briefing sheet” with nine topics that might come up in the meeting.Genuine learning, says Branson, comes from being curious, asking questions and being prepared to engage in a meaningful discussion. And engaged speakers are present.Felts acknowledged that, before meeting Branson, he was like many young entrepreneurs—constantly on his phone, distracted during meetings, and not fully present in conversations. Watching Branson’s approach changed his perspective entirely. “Richard really taught me the art of being present and giving your undivided attention to the individual or the group that you’re with,” Felts said. Felts learned by osmosis to pay attention and has made the habit fundamental to his leadership style.Listening to Felts and Branson talk about the lessons in Hollywood Virgin reminded me that success isn’t just about what you know. It’s about what you learn from your wins and yes, your mistakes.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",
