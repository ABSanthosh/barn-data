Revealed for the first time during the Future Games Show, Fading Echo is built on a simple idea:movement, combat, and enigmas can all flow from the same source. The first trailer is now available to watch below. I saw the game in a demo and the movement is quite fluid. A Journey Through Fluid Gameplay In Fading Echo, you play as One, a young Legend who shifts between human and aquatic forms to explore, fight, and adapt across ever-changing realities. From gliding through pipes as a droplet to crashing down as a water bomb, movement becomes your greatest tool — and your sharpest weapon. Time’s unraveling, and One’s running out of track. To save what’s left of her world, she’ll need to reboot the Ætheric flow, kick the heart of a broken bastion back to life, and crack open the secrets festering in her own bloodline. Reality is fracturing fast, and the truth might be tucked into a legacy she barely understands. Oh, and there’s a flying whale, sort of… the devs call it the Last Wonder. Just roll with it. The game is built around systemic interactions, where water, vapor (steam), and elemental forces collide in unexpected ways. Each ability opens up new tactical options — casting crushing waves, unleashing powerful close-range attacks, and evolving your playstyle as you unlock new skills. Master the shift between offense, tactics, and exploration to shape how you approach each encounter. A Living, Systemic World The Echoverse is a fractured multiverse made up of many shifting worlds — and Corel is one of them. It’s the starting point of your journey: a mysterious planet where ancient ruins, unstable portals, and strange forces collide. Across the Echoverse, each zone rewrites the rules. Portals distort logic, surroundings evolve, and no two areas behave the same way. The world shifts in a challenging way, forcing you to adapt, experiment, and occasionally just go with the flow. The game’s comic-inspired art direction reinforces this sense of instability and wonder, turning each zone into a striking, unpredictable space where style meets surprise. “We didn’t want to make a backdrop — we wanted to make a world you can mess with,” said Sylvain Sechi, Head of Studio at Emeteria. “Fading Echo is a game where creativity, curiosity, and a little recklessness are always rewarded.” “Fading Echo is our first fully internal project, and I couldn’t be prouder of what the Emeteria team has built. It’s a fresh and exciting start for us, and a great testimony to the kind of games we want to make.” added Cédric Maréchal, co-founder and CEO at New Tales. To bring even more life into the vibrant world of Correl, Fading Echo will feature full English voiceover, brought to life by a cast of ridiculously talented (and, frankly, adorable) people — including Samantha Béart, Jasmine Bhullar, Laura Bailey, and Matt Mercer, among others. “We’ve been incredibly fortunate. What started as a bold indie adventure somehow brought together world-class voice talents, a brilliant composer, and an extraordinary writer. I think they saw the spark in our vision and just said, ‘Let’s do this… but seriously, stop chasing me every day,'” said Emmanuel Obert, chief creative officer at New Tales, in a statement.",
