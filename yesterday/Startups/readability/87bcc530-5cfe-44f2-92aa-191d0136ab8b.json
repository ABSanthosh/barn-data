  "text": "Imagine a patient logging into Cedars-Sinai’s virtual urgent care platform, complaining of a persistent cough. The first clinician to respond isn’t a human. It’s an AI trained on billions of data points of real-world medical records—asking the right questions, evaluating the patient’s history, and calculating likely diagnoses before a physician ever joins the call.  It’s a hypothetical scenario, but one that closely mirrors how K Health’s technology already works. In a study announced today, by researchers from Cedars-Sinai, Tel Aviv University, and biotechnology company K Health, a panel of expert physicians reviewed 461 patient visits in which both K Health’s new diagnostic AI model and a doctor made clinical recommendations. The AI’s diagnoses and suggestions for treatment matched the doctors’ in roughly 68 percent of cases. In the remaining third, expert reviewers rated the AI’s treatment plan as superior.  “We put AI to the test in real-world situations, not static textbook scenarios,” said Ran Shaul, co-founder and chief product officer at K Health. “You’re dealing with complex human beings, and AI has to deal with incomplete data and a very diverse set of patients.” The study focused on common acute issues, like a cough, urinary symptoms, and eye pain. Patient data used in the study came from Cedars-Sinai Connect, a virtual urgent care app. The system utilized structured questioning combined with clinical record data to generate diagnoses and treatment plans, which were then handed off to real, human physicians before the visit.  K Health’s CEO, Allon Bloch, insists the findings don’t create competition for physicians, but rather can augment them, and validate an AI-assisted health care model. “This study validates what we’ve long believed at K Health—that AI trained on high-quality clinical data can transform health care delivery,” said Bloch. “We’re establishing a new paradigm for patient care that combines access, accuracy, and clinical excellence.” The company built its technology on the foundation that, if AI could be trained on a large enough data set, it could soon approximate and even enhance how physicians make clinical decisions.  “We built an information layer that’s not WebMD, not guessing, not scary,” said Bloch. “It’s a 24/7 system that has a medical record … and can always put us [doctors] in front of accurate information.” The technology is currently used in partnership with several large U.S. health care systems, including Cedars-Sinai, Hackensack Meridian Health, and Hartford HealthCare. In these systems, the Physician Mode AI helps clinicians offer informed care plans.  “The AI is giving you some pretty good information and recommendations,” said Caroline Goldzweig, chief medical officer of Cedars-Sinai Medical Network. “Then your job as a doctor is to corroborate that.” The model is also built to admit when it should not make a judgment call—a trait that many other AI models lack, which creates issues around trust and safety.  “In about 20 percent of cases, the AI did what good doctors do—it said ‘I don’t know’ when it was not confident enough to make a recommendation,” the study noted. That may explain why the AI also made fewer potentially harmful recommendations, just 2.8 percent compared with the physicians’ 4.6 percent. Goldzweig believes the system’s true value lies in its ability to support physicians. Now, she’s exploring ways to bring the technology into in-person urgent care settings. “If technology can support the data gathering in a way that is accurate, that could be a huge timesaver for physicians,” she said. “And leave them more time to talk to patients about the care plan.” The U.S. faces an enlarging primary care shortage, with an estimated lack of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. The K Health team sees its AI as a way to scale care delivery. “America is facing … a huge crisis in health care,” said Bloch. “There are not enough primary care doctors, a lot of them are quitting.” Shaul added, “The physician needs to balance efficiency, speed, with quality. All of a sudden, we kind of invented time … We found a way to please both sides in a way that is actually scalable.” By handling the repeatable, structured tasks like symptom gathering and record review, the AI frees up physicians to focus on the human stuff: interpreting nuances, and building trust with patients. That’s the future K Health is betting on.The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply Today.",
