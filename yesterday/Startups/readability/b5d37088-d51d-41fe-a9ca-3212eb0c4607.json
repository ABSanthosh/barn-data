  "text": "As AI becomes more embedded in our everyday lives, it’s more important than ever that the tools we use are trustworthy, secure, and compliant with legal and ethical standards.  At Intercom, trust is the foundation of every product we build and every relationship we grow. We’re committed to delivering the highest standards of security for our customers, and we’re proud to announce that we’re one of the first AI customer service platforms to have achieved ISO/IEC 42001:2023 certification – the world’s first international standard focused on the governance of artificial intelligence management systems (AIMS). ISO 42001 is an international standard that ensures organizations are managing AI systems responsibly, and that AI is being developed and used ethically and safely. “Achieving certification demonstrates that Intercom’s practices meet the highest standards of AI governance” This new framework sets a global benchmark for secure and transparent AI, and achieving certification demonstrates that Intercom’s practices meet the highest standards of AI governance.  For our customers, this certification offers greater assurance that Intercom’s AI-driven experiences are built in a way that’s responsible, compliant, and trustworthy. It reinforces that our AI capabilities operate within a framework that prioritizes safety, and aligns Intercom with global and regional regulatory frameworks, including the EU AI Act, ensuring we remain at the forefront of responsible AI governance. Our commitment to transparency and security We’ve always pursued the highest standards of industry recognized accreditation to demonstrate our commitment to the protection and security of our customers’ data. As AI continues to evolve, so will our practices. But as the first globally recognized management system standard for AI, ISO 42001 is an important step in our journey to deliver AI technology that’s not just powerful, but trustworthy. This milestone was made possible by our dedicated Security GRC team, whose mission is to enable business growth through proactive security and compliance. The certification was awarded following an independent audit conducted by Schellman, an accredited certification body under ANAB (ANSI National Accreditation Board), the largest multi-disciplinary accreditation body in North America. Alongside ISO 42001, Intercom is certified across other globally respected standards and frameworks, including ISO 27001, ISO 27701, ISO 27018, HIPAA, SOC 2, and HDS, reflecting our holistic, long-term commitment to security and data privacy. You can access our certifications, audit reports, and other security and compliance documentation at any time in our dedicated Trust Center.",
