One simple way to reduce the environmental impact of fashion is to buy fewer clothes and to wear them for longer. But with children’s clothing, this is not possible, as kids outgrow their clothes and shoes very quickly. Enter Zig+Star. The footwear startup has developed shoes designed to expand and adjust as the child grows. To achieve this, the shoes and boots feature a “Good-to-Grow” midsole. This hidden layer can be easily removed to add an extra half-size of growing room to the shoe. Sandals feature adjustable straps so they can be altered as the child grows.  To make sure its shoes go the distance, Zig+Star uses high-quality, certified chrome-free leather and outsoles made from natural rubber. The packaging is also sustainable, made from recycled materials and can be recycled or composted. The shoeboxes double as mini-suitcases, which children can use for play. Uniquely, in this age of fast fashion, Zig+Star’s shoes are designed to be timeless, as well as gender-neutral. This makes them easier to pass on when they finally do get too small. Outgrown shoes can also be sent back to Zig+Star for donation to a partner charity, resale, or recycling free of charge. Earlier this year, the company was chosen to join the Amazon Sustainability Accelerator. As part of the 10-week bespoke programme, Zig+Star attended expert-led workshops, and received mentorship, a €12,000 equity-free grant, and $10,000 in AWS Activate Credits. The shoes are available to purchase on the company website, as well as through a number of well-known stockists – the most recently announced being John Lewis \u0026 Partners.
