Spotted: Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are airborne signals that allow plants to communicate with other organisms. For instance, when a plant is damaged by herbivorous pests, it releases VOCs. These are detected by neighbouring plants, which can enhance their defences against potential threats accordingly. Now, researchers at the Tokyo University of Science are investigating this premise to help boost agriculture. In a recent study, Professor Gen-ichiro Arimura and Takuya Uemura set out to better understand this intricate communication method and the specific molecular pathways behind it. One key finding from the study was that these plant interactions don’t just occur between those that are related, and also happen between non-kin crops. The researchers believe that in better understanding VOCs, it could help farmers reduce pesticide use by offering a natural way to boost crop protection and productivity. Currently, chemical pesticides are widely used to protect crops, but these are often toxic to animals and insects, contaminate soil and water, lead to loss of biodiversity, and are linked to chronic human illnesses such as cancer and neurological disease. Plants emit a variety of VOCs when under attack, and these can attract beneficial insects as well as repel herbivores. Already, monoterpenoids, which are abundant in mint plants, have been used for their pest-repelling and antimicrobial properties. Incorporating companion plants like potted mint, which emit these beneficial VOCs, could help to naturally improve plant defences without pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
