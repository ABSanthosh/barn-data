  "text": "No one said starting and growing a business is easy. As the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics points out, only 35 percent—about a third—of businesses born in 2013 were still in operation 10 years later. That leaves a lot of businesses that didn’t make it to their tenth anniversary.Fortunately, hope springs eternal in the hearts of founders and entrepreneurs and businesspeople in every position—from the front line to the C suite. And who better to inspire than the eternally optimistic characters in Disney films? Here are 15 Disney quotes to give you a boost whenever you need it the most.1. “Giving up is for rookies.” — Philoctetes (Hercules)You miss 100 percent of the shots you don’t take.

Listen with your heart, you will understand.” — Grandmother Willow (Pocahontas).Don’t lose sight of what truly matters. Align your goals with your passions.7. “If you don’t know where you want to go, then it doesn’t matter which path you take.” — The Cheshire Cat (Alice in Wonderland)If you don’t have a clear vision, you can’t effectively guide your organization—or yourself—toward success.8. “Even miracles take a little time.” — Fairy Godmother (Cinderella)Patience is essential. It takes time and persistence to achieve the success you so richly deserve.9. “Just keep swimming!” — Dory (Finding Nemo)When faced with challenges, persistence is often the best approach.
