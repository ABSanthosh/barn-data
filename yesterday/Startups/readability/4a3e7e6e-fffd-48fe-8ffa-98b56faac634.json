  "text": "AppLovin, a public mobile adtech company, has recently experienced some epic highs and lows. In its fiscal year 2024, AppLovin’s net income skyrocketed to a mind-boggling $1.58 billion. That’s up 343 percent from 2023, when the company’s net income was $358 million. The gains were attributed almost entirely to AppLovin’s advertising business, which grew 75 percent year-over-year, going from $1.84 billion to $3.22 billion. AppLovin’s advertising wins have supercharged the company’s stock. In November, after AppLovin’s Q3 earnings report, the company’s stock shot up from $168 per share to $290, making it the fastest growing public tech company of the year. After the Q4 report in February, the stock reached an all-time high of $510 per share. But then drama ensued: Just a few days later, reports from two short-seller organizations with allegations of deception and fraud popped a hole in AppLovin’s balloon, and the stock sank back down to around $250 per share. Here’s everything you need to know about AppLovin, the tech behind its rise, and the allegations against the company. What is AppLovin? AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi cofounded the company in 2011 with the mission of helping developers get their mobile apps discovered by new audiences. Since then, the company claims to have spurred tens of billions of app installs through advertisements. The company has several arms, but most of its business comes from a product called AppDiscovery, which helps mobile app creators target audiences most likely to download and engage with their app. If you’ve ever played a mobile game and had to watch an advertisement for another app in order to continue playing, you’ve likely encountered AppLovin’s tech in action.How does AppLovin’s business (and AI) model work? AppDiscovery is powered by an AI model, called Axon 2.0, that has been trained on data related to consumer behavior, ad engagement, and win and loss notification data from ad auctions. When an advertiser uses AppLovin to distribute their ads, they enter a digital auction space where they set the amount they’re willing to pay per app download. AppLovin gets a cut of each transaction, which is where the majority of its revenue comes from. It’s a similar business model to Google’s money-making AdSense platform. According to AppLovin’s recent annual report, this business model is designed to be self-improving. “As more advertisers use our Advertising solutions to market and monetize their content,” the company wrote, “we gain access to more data regarding users and user engagement, further strengthening our scaled distribution.” As AppLovin’s distribution grows, it can “gain better insights for our AXON recommendation engine,” further enhancing the “efficiency and effectiveness” of the company’s AI-driven ad placements.AppLovin also owns a portfolio of app development studios, which create casual mobile games such as Matchington Mansion. The company has recently announced plans to sell the studios to a London-based game developer for $900 million.What’s up with these short seller reports? In mid-February, AppLovin’s epic stock run came to an abrupt end when two short-seller organizations, FuzzyPanda and Culper, published reports alleging that AppLovin hasn’t been entirely truthful about the nature of its recent success. Culper wrote that “AppLovin has employed AXON 2.0 largely as a promotional tool – a smokescreen to hide the true drivers of its mobile gaming and e-commerce initiatives, neither of which have much to do with AI.”The short-sellers alleged that AppLovin has used technology and intentionally-bad UX design to trick unwitting consumers into downloading apps, specifically on Android mobile devices. If you play mobile games, you’ve likely encountered ads that initially seem like they can be closed by tapping a small X icon located in the corner of the screen, but instead of closing the ad, you’re taken to the app store page of the advertised game. In its report, Culper claims to have proof that apps with AppLovin-provided ads have permissions to automatically install new apps on Android devices without even opening the Google Play store, which potentially goes against a Google policy prohibiting “apps that install other apps on a device without the user’s prior consent.” To accomplish this, Culper says AppLovin has made deals with mobile carriers and mobile device manufacturers to pre-install AppLovin’s tech before the device has even been unboxed. The firm pointed to a 2023 press release in which the company announced a deal to equip new Samsung mobile devices in Brazil with “personalized on-device app recommendations and optimized experiences.” In essence, Culper alleges, this means that some mobile devices come with AppLovin software that can recommend and install apps during the device setup, which is why the company is granted unique permissions to install apps without using the Google Play store. The short sellers say that these direct app downloads are the true source of AppLovin’s success, and the company is attempting to obscure that fact by attributing its growth to artificial intelligence, while being intentionally vague about how its AI technology actually works. The short seller firms also claimed that AppLovin is using consumer data from Meta to train its AI model and is illegally tracking user data of children. Is this really a big deal, and what does the company say?The two short-seller organizations aren’t complete unknowns. Bloomberg reported that Fuzzy Panda was the best performing activist short seller in 2023, and in 2024 caused a 53 percent dip in shares of financial services company Globe Life after releasing a report that alleged management had been ignoring “obvious” insurance fraud. Over the past year, however, Globe Life has managed to recover that lost value. And the short-sellers’ points aren’t entirely without merit; AppLovin certainly does seem to engage in annoying advertising practices, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the company is doing anything illegal or lying about the source of its success. AppLovin declined to comment for this story, but CEO Adam Foroughi addressed the situation in a company blog post on February 26, writing that the reports were “littered with inaccuracies and false assertions.” The CEO took umbrage at the allegation that AppLovin had been sneakily installing apps without consent, writing that “every download results from an explicit user choice—whether via the App Store or our Direct Download experience.” He also said that the company does not use data from external companies (like Meta) and does not track any data related to children. For their part, financial analysts are decidedly unconvinced by the reports. In a letter to investors, Wells Fargo analyst Alec Brondolo reportedly said that the allegations of AppLovin’s success coming from secret app downloads are “silly,” and pointed out that other companies like Unity and Digital Turbine employ near-identical business models. In fact, some analysts say the stock slump is a buying opportunity for investors, and are recommending they add AppLovin to their portfolio before the stock price rises again. Bank of America analyst Omar Dessouky reportedly said in a late February investor note that he was confident AppLovin’s stock would quickly regain its value, writing that BofA expects “any complexity-driven valuation discount to dissipate over time as AppLovin‘s financial performance sustains, and new investors familiarize themselves with the mechanics of mobile adtech and its auction processes.”The extended application deadline for Inc.'s Best Workplaces Awards is this Friday, March 14, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
