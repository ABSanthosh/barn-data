  "text": "Landing a job at major tech companies like Meta, Google, or Salesforce can feel like an uphill battle. According to Brenna Lasky, a former recruiter who spent years hiring for these industry giants, many job seekers unknowingly sabotage their chances with missteps that are easily avoidable. From a recent interview with Ana Altchek from BusinessInsider.com, Lasky shares her top tips to boost your chances of success. The LinkedIn Trap: It’s Not Enough to Post Lasky points out that while a polished LinkedIn profile is important, simply sharing posts or commenting isn’t likely to lead to job offers. “Activity on LinkedIn helps build your network, but the real magic happens when you take the initiative to reach out to decision-makers directly,” she explains. Instead of passively waiting, job seekers should use LinkedIn to identify key contacts at target companies and seek referrals. Personal outreach demonstrates genuine interest and often gives candidates an edge in competitive hiring processes. Salary Talks: Timing is Everything One of the most common mistakes observed is candidates bringing up compensation too early in the process. She recommends waiting until an offer is on the table before diving into salary discussions. “Companies often have room to negotiate, but candidates lose leverage when they discuss numbers prematurely,” Lasky notes. Exceptions might include situations where multiple interviews are scheduled, and prioritization is necessary, or when task assignments are time-consuming. By waiting, candidates allow the employer to see their value first, which can lead to more favorable terms during negotiations. It’s also important to prepare for these discussions by researching salary benchmarks for the role and location. Smart Research: Quality Over Quantity Many job seekers invest hours researching every detail about a company, often crafting elaborate presentations that go unnoticed. Lasky advises against this approach. “An hour of focused research is usually enough to understand a company’s values, products, and recent developments,” she says. Instead, she encourages candidates to prioritize connecting with employees or recruiters who can provide insider insights. Over-preparation can waste valuable time and energy better spent networking or preparing for interviews. Resumes: Strong, Not Over-Tailored Tailoring resumes for every application might seem like a good idea, but Lasky warns against it unless candidates have highly diverse backgrounds. “A well-crafted resume that highlights impact and uses industry-relevant terminology will perform better than one that’s over-customized for every role,” she explains. Instead, candidates should ensure their resumes align with the job’s core requirements and emphasize measurable achievements. Even more crucial is securing a referral—a step that significantly improves the likelihood of getting noticed by hiring managers. Lasky stresses that a standout resume paired with a personal recommendation can often bypass applicant tracking systems altogether. Moving Beyond the Basics While Lasky’s insights provide a strong foundation, it’s essential to consider how the job market has evolved. For example, remote work has expanded opportunities, but it also means more competition for coveted roles. Staying informed about trends such as AI in hiring or shifting company priorities can help candidates stay ahead. Final Thoughts Breaking into Big Tech requires more than technical expertise. Success often hinges on strategic planning, effective networking, and smart prioritization. By avoiding common pitfalls like over-researching, premature salary discussions, or relying solely on LinkedIn activity, job seekers can better position themselves to land their dream roles.",
