  "text": "For most of the past 30 years, websites have had legal protection for content that was created by their users. In the coming years, those protections could look a lot different—or vanish entirely. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which has offered that shield for social media companies like YouTube, Facebook, and X (formerly Twitter), and any other site that allows user-generated content, is expected to be the focus of a bipartisan bill aiming to repeal those protections, reports The Information. The bill could be introduced to the Senate as soon as next week, according to the outlet. Section 230 has often been called “the 26 words that made the internet.” It was an essential part of the growth of the online world in the early 2000s, giving safe harbor to internet service providers and websites. The proposed legislation comes as big tech and the government have increasingly faced off in recent years over matters of free speech and antitrust. Here’s what you need to know. What is Section 230? Introduced in 1996, Section 230 is a part of the Communications Decency Act that provides immunity for online services for any third-party (or user-generated) content they host. It was born from a pair of lawsuits in the 1990s that gave differing answers on whether internet service providers should be treated as publishers. Representatives Christopher Cox (R-Calif.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) argued websites and ISPs should instead be viewed as distributors who were not liable for the content they displayed, with exceptions for copyrighted material and other content that violates laws. What would the repeal of Section 230 mean for businesses? As you might imagine, the answer to that question varies wildly, based on the type of business. The National Association of Attorneys General suggests that social media companies could be held liable “for the consequences of their recommendation algorithms.” Retailers, meanwhile, could be responsible for user comments about products in review sections of their site. Essentially, any tech company (or even a small or midsize business with a website) could be subject to civil lawsuits for virtually any material posted by any user. That could open the floodgates for frivolous lawsuits, which could be a huge financial drain on a large number of companies. In many cases, it could result in smaller companies doing away with any user-posted content, which could give big tech an opportunity to potentially grow even bigger. “If you repeal Section 230, one of two things will happen. Either platforms will decide they don’t want to moderate anything, or platforms will moderate everything,” Sinan Aral, an MIT professor and the author of The Hype Machine, told Inc. in 2021. And, as the Electronic Frontier Foundation puts it: “For more than 25 years, Section 230 has protected us all: small blogs and websites, big platforms, and individual users. The free and open internet as we know it couldn’t exist without Section 230.” Who is introducing legislation to potentially repeal Section 230? The Information reports senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) have teamed up to introduce this bill, with co-sponsorship coming from Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). Where does Donald Trump stand on the repeal of Section 230? Trump pushed for the repeal of Section 230 during his first administration, going so far as to threaten to veto a critical defense spending bill if the shields weren’t lifted. And in May 2020, he issued an executive order that attempted to limit Section 230’s legal protections after Twitter added fact checks to several of his tweets regarding voting by mail. How likely is it that Section 230 will be fully repealed? A complete erasure of Section 230 could have wide-ranging free speech implications and could negatively impact a wide swath of the tech sector. The senators are reportedly hoping the threat of a repeal, however, will get tech companies to negotiate with Congress over alterations to the protections, modernizing them to account for the changes in the way the internet operates now compared with the mid-’90s. Exactly what each side wants is still kind of fuzzy. Republicans have said tech companies, under Section 230, take down too much content, especially from conservatives, while Democrats have argued that with the proliferation of hate speech online, not enough content is being removed. It’s too soon to tell, but it’s possible that small businesses could get a pass. A proposal made four years ago included rule exemptions for platforms that generate less than $25 million in annual revenue and attract fewer than one million monthly active users. That bill died in committee.The preferred-rate application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is this Friday, March 21, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply Today.",
