  "text": "The popularity of GLP-1 receptor agonists like Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound has sparked an unprecedented demand in both the medical and aesthetic spaces. As these medications become more mainstream—used for everything from Type 2 diabetes to weight loss and wellness—med spa owners across the country are increasingly incorporating GLP-1s into their services. But behind the scenes, a legal showdown is playing out. At the center of the controversy? The legality of compounded versions of these drugs, which are often more affordable and accessible for patients. What was once a quiet regulatory issue has erupted into full-blown litigation, with the FDA, pharmaceutical giants, and compounding pharmacies all clashing in court. The legal battle unfolds To understand what’s happening now, we have to look back at late 2024. Amid high demand and supply shortages, many compounding pharmacies began producing versions of GLP-1 drugs like semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound). Under Section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, this was permitted as long as the ingredients were on the FDA’s drug shortage list. That changed in October 2024, when the FDA declared the shortage of tirzepatide to be resolved, effectively revoking compounding protections for that drug. In response, the Outsourcing Facilities Association (OFA) filed a lawsuit against the FDA, arguing that the shortage still existed and that the FDA had improperly relied on data from Eli Lilly (maker of Mounjaro and Zepbound) to make its decision. When the OFA asked a federal judge in Texas for a preliminary injunction to allow compounding pharmacies to continue making tirzepatide during the legal proceedings, the request was denied on March 6, 2025. The ruling was sealed, leaving the reasoning unclear. The OFA quickly filed an interlocutory appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in hopes of overturning the decision and re-opening access for compounders and patients alike. Pharmaceutical companies push back with lawsuits At the same time, major drug manufacturers have launched direct legal attacks on compounders. In April 2025, Eli Lilly filed lawsuits against two compounding pharmacies—Strive Pharmacy and Empower Clinic Services—alleging that they were selling unapproved versions of tirzepatide. These lawsuits, filed in New Jersey and Delaware federal courts, argue that the compounders are infringing on Lilly’s intellectual property and deceiving customers about the safety and legitimacy of their products. Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, has also jumped into the legal fight—this time by intervening in the OFA’s lawsuit against the FDA. The company supports the agency’s move to restrict compounded semaglutide and has made it clear that it views compounders as a threat to both patient safety and its market share. These cases show that pharmaceutical companies aren’t waiting for regulators to act—they’re now aggressively defending their turf in court. What this means for med spa owners If you run a medical spa and offer weight loss or wellness services, this legal chaos isn’t just industry noise—it could reshape your operations. Here’s how:  Your sourcing matters: Med spas must ensure that all GLP-1 medications are sourced from FDA-compliant, licensed facilities. If you’re buying from a pharmacy that’s under legal scrutiny or using questionable compounding practices, your business could be at risk.  Increased legal exposure: If you offer compounded GLP-1s and those products become the subject of litigation or FDA enforcement, you could be named in lawsuits or state medical board complaints, especially if there are adverse patient outcomes.  Rising costs and limited access: With the legal pushback tightening supply, expect the cost of brand-name medications to rise—and for compounded versions to become more restricted. This will force many med spas to reprice services or reevaluate whether they can offer weight loss programs at all.  Stay informed and proactive: Regulations are evolving rapidly. Business owners should consult with healthcare counsel regularly and ensure their consent forms, standard operating procedures, and marketing materials are updated and legally vetted.  The bottom line This isn’t just a battle over who gets to sell weight loss shots. It’s a high-stakes clash over access, pricing, and regulatory power. As the courts weigh the future of compounded GLP-1s, med spas should prepare for rapid changes—both legally and economically. The smart play? Keep your legal house in order, vet your vendors, and stay informed. The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply Today.",
