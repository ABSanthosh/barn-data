  "text": "Raccoon Logic announced that it’s launching the Cosmic Hoarder Edition of its upcoming title, Revenge of the Savage Planet today — three days ahead of the standard edition launch on May 8. The Cosmic Hoarder Edition is currently available to play on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S and is playable both in single-player form and couch/online co-op. Revenge is a sequel to 2020’s Journey to the Savage Planet, which was developed by Typhoon Studios. The company began work on the sequel as far back as 2021. Several former staffers of Typhoon formed Raccoon Logic after the studio was acquired by the ill-fated Stadia Games and Entertainment. It also regained the IP of Savage Planet as Raccoon Logic. Dean got to preview Revenge of the Savage Planet during last year’s Game Awards, and he said of the game: “One of the interesting things is that there is more than one planet to visit in this game, making the name of the game seem a little inaccurate. In fact, you have to survive on four savage planets and scan everything you find on them. The flora is very different on all of the planets.” The Cosmic Hoarder Edition offers users several additional cosmetics and missions, as well as an official artbook and soundtrack. Alex Hutchinson, Raccoon Logic’s creative director, said, “It almost doesn’t feel real – we’re so honoured to share that Revenge of the Savage Planet has now launched on PC and console! What was once a glimmer of an idea from a team who’d been kicked to the curb, is now a real, tangible thing that we can’t wait for you to explore. We hope you have half as much fun playing this game as we had making it, if it weren’t for you, the players, we wouldn’t be able to keep creating these weird (and hopefully wonderful) stories, so from the bottom of our raccoon hearts, thank you. Now go play, there are savage planets to explore!” GB Daily Stay in the know! Get the latest news in your inbox daily Read our Privacy Policy Thanks for subscribing.
