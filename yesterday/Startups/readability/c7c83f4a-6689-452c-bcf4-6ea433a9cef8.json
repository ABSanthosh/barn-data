  "text": "A lot of tech talk these days contains a deserved degree of doom and gloom. However, as is usually the case, the real advancements are taking place between the lines and beneath the fold.Three developments of late have particularly caught my eye. These are traces of doing it better, rather than simply doing it bigger—building the unsexy plumbing of a new technology, being more creative under resource constraints, and generally tackling problems worth solving.1. Cheaper AI from DeepSeekDeepSeek, a Chinese alternative to ChatGPT, made headlines in late January. DeepSeek’s R1 model performed comparably to OpenAI’s o1 model—but at a fraction of the cost, compute, and chip usage.Here’s how: Fewer chips: A technical report from DeepSeek claims the model was trained on just over 2,000 Nvidia GPUs compared to the 16,000 GPUs it takes to run ChatGPT. More basic chips: DeepSeek used Nvidia’s H800 chips which are (allegedly) lower performing and less energy-intensive than the H100 chips used by ChatGPT. Lower-bit numbers: DeepSeek uses 8-bit floating point numbers for most calculations, while most U.S. firms use “full precision” 32-bit numbers. Technical, I know, but suffice it to say that this means DeepSeek’s model loses a little precision (an inconsequential degree for most tasks) but saves a ton of compute. Cheaper AI is better for everyone. This will make AI more accessible to more innovators, especially since DeepSeek’s R1 model is open source. It may also mitigate the foreboding environmental impacts of AI use at scale.As venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya pointed out, the DeepSeek development shows how the Western world has been throwing billions of dollars at the AI problem, and now it’s time to think through the problem more cleverly. I hope the tech industry learns to exercise some restraint and work within resource limits that create good outcomes for us as a whole. That’s what innovation is truly about.2. Google’s NotebookLMFormerly known as Project Tailwind, NotebookLM is an AI service that learns from you—from your documents, data, notes, recordings, videos, and other things that you upload. It can even create customized audio summaries. For example, I speak on occasion at Mobile App Summit events and MAU Vegas. NotebookLM could digest these videos and distill them into a podcast, social media post, or a blog for my website.Last year, I launched a direct to consumer product, Scribbly, an AI children’s book app[1]  that puts your kid right into the story. I want to try uploading data from our Google Analytics and Meta Ads accounts to NotebookLM to see if I can directly ask for details like customer acquisition costs and ad performance. My prediction is that AI will kill the dashboard and disrupt business intelligence platforms as we know them, but that’s a conversation for another time.A cool thing about NotebookLM is that you can dedicate different “notebooks” for different purposes. While I may feed Scribbly data into one notebook, I can feed my personal data, journaling, and so forth into another.The personal use cases for such a tool are endless. Imagine plugging your insurance information into it to better understand your policy, or feeding it dense whitepapers and research in a particular field to better understand them.3. HologramsBack in 2012, Snoop Dogg closed out his headline set at Coachella by performing with a hologram of Tupac Shakur. Of course at the time, the hologram was produced through projections, mirrors, and screens. The hologram’s performance itself was pre-precorded, but still thrilling for many.The display technology has come a long way, and pairing AI with holograms opens the field for innumerable use cases. Museums are using holograms to make history more engaging by producing historical holograms that students and visitors can interact with. Can you imagine having a conversation with Anne Frank or George Washington? It adds a whole new layer of preservation to the voices of our past. In the most optimistic view, this type of technology can help fight historical erasure, like Holocaust denial, and cultivate a humanistic interest in history.Additionally, holograms offer huge potential in technical education—performing surgery or repairing a jet engine, for example. In a business context, holograms could make product demos and facility tours much more engaging.The common denominatorAI advancements have followed the trajectory of most technological advancements. At first, they are expensive and cumbersome to procure and deploy, meaning mostly enterprise-sized entities can put them to use. Once in the market, innovators take these technologies and make them smaller, cheaper, and more diverse in their use and application. Then, like the computer or video camera, everyone has one in their pocket and doesn’t think twice about it. At this point, we’re at stage 2 with AI. It’s so exciting to see this technology paired with previously parallel advancements in hardware. More broadly, we’re seeing the technological plumbing being laid, providing infrastructure on which entrepreneurs and regular users can fuel their imaginations. Change is happening fast. I’m eager to see what comes next.The preferred-rate application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is this Friday, March 21, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply Today.",
