From managing resources to keeping staff happy and delivering a consistently high-quality product or service, it's a constant effort that breeds many highs and lows.No matter how well you finish one year and start the next, it's vitally important to examine your business performance over the past 12 months. By celebrating the wins and critically assessing the shortcomings, you can develop a robust plan not just to survive but thrive.Make a list of what is and isn't workingTaking a good, hard look at your business strategy and deciphering what is and isn't working is the best way to eliminate the unnecessary and make way for the bigger and better. There will always be ups and downs, but how you manage them is what makes the difference.

A big, audacious goal is the kind of goal that is brave, bold, and compelling enough to empower your team to strive toward achieving it.This could be to hit one million followers on your social media platform, increase revenue by 50%, become the number one product in your industry market or reach capacity on client intake.A big, audacious goal looks different for every business, so there is no one set of rules for how it should exist or manifest throughout the year.
