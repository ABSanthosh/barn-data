  "text": "If you ask an entrepreneur why they started their business, generally accepted accounting principles are not likely to top their list of motivations. But as a company scales, understanding the books becomes a big part of the job. Managing cash flow is a key responsibility for founders—even the quantitatively challenged ones. In this current environment of higher costs, elevated interest rates, and profitability-focused investors, that task has become even more vital. For startups experiencing rapid growth, it can be even trickier.  To help entrepreneurs wrap up the fourth quarter and kick off the new year on solid financial footing, Inc. compiled advice from three top CEOs who spoke together on a panel about cash flow at the Inc. 5000 Conference in Palm Desert, California in October. Here are their tips for handling the inflow and outflow of capital.Know your monthly fixed costsFor Cate Luzio, all cash flow conversations start with the same exact question. The founder and CEO of Luminary, a New York-based professional education and networking platform for women and allies, always asks her entrepreneur clients: What are your average monthly expenses?  “Ninety-five percent of the founders have no idea, because they’re not looking at their numbers every month, or they’re looking at what’s just sitting in their bank account,” says Luzio, who landed on the 2021 Inc. Female Founders list. “Whether good times or bad, I always start with expenses.”Once founders know their monthly fixed costs, like rent and payroll, they will have a better idea of where they can cut or set up a payment plan with a vendor, if needed.Know your rate of cash burn—and cut itTricia Taitt, founder and CEO of the New York-based fractional CFO and accounting business FinCore, emphasizes the same metric for all of her clients regardless of industry. It all comes down to cash burn. “Cash burn is not just the cash that you spend on direct costs and overhead expenses, but also if you’re paying out debt, if you plan to purchase assets, if you have to purchase inventory,” explains Taitt.“No matter what kind of business you have, that is the most important key performance metric,” says Taitt, who has each one of her clients build a cash-flow tracker that forecasts the company’s rate of cash burn. “How many months of cash do we have sitting in the bank? Anything under three months of cash is uncomfortable for me.”Invest in forecastingTo more effectively manage your startup’s cash flow, Meenakshi Lala, CEO of remote floral delivery business UrbanStems, advises founders to invest in a solid demand forecasting team. “Today, in the post-pandemic era, planning and forecasting, in my opinion, is one hundred-fold more critical, especially in perishable businesses,” says Lala, who helped the decade-old company secure $5 million in a Series C extension round earlier this year. As part of those quarterly projections, Luzio says to break down the forecasts into three tiers of scenarios: growth, flat, and a decline—or as Taitt calls it, a “stress test case.” Think: the worst-case scenario.  Rein in customer acquisition costsFounders also need to keep their customer acquisitions costs in check. Companies can no longer “throw some money at paid search” in hopes of driving sales, says Lala. “Marketing costs have gone up significantly,” she explains. “That strategy doesn’t work anymore.”Communicate the numbers to all stakeholders One of the most important aspects of cash-flow management is communication. All three CEOs agree that founders need to make sure all stakeholders—board members, investors, bankers, and employees—know the numbers, at least top-line revenue and margins, and understand them. “Whenever you have the disparity between projections and what’s happening in real life, communicate, communicate,” says Taitt. “That is really important to maintain those relationships and be honest.” She adds, “Don’t lie to them.”That advice also extends to members of your own team. “Not everybody on the team needs to know all the exact numbers, but I think it’s important that the team knows where you’re at each quarter,” says Luzio. “You have to really educate.”UrbanStems shares that financial information each month during a town hall. Lala talks with her team about what worked and what did not. “We’re not a public company, so we don’t owe anybody a monthly forecast, but my intent of doing that is twofold,” says Lala, who explains that it comes down to transparency and teaching. The CEO wants to ensure, “everyone understands and knows the reality of what the business is doing” and “how their decisions and what they do in the business impacts the bottom line.”Also, for a young company with plenty of entry-level employees, Lala says it is a CEO’s responsibility as a leader to help younger professionals get comfortable with numbers and a cash-flow statement. “A lot of folks in our business, this is their first job. They got hired during the pandemic. They don’t know what a recession means. They don’t know what an economic downturn means. They’ve never seen anything like it.”",
