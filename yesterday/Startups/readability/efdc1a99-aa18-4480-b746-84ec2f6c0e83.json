  "link": "https://share.transistor.fm/s/7fce7861",
  "description": "SummaryIn this engaging episode of Startup Junkies, hosts Caleb Talley and Kendall Jasper are joined by Humphrey Chin, founder of CLIPr, who shared how his startup is revolutionizing documentation for police officers. Originally conceived as a tool to pinpoint important moments in any video—serving students, event attendees, and enterprise teams—CLIPr found its true calling during a pivotal accelerator program. After a Bentonville police officer heard Humphrey’s pitch, it became clear that law enforcement needed a faster, smarter solution for creating police reports from hours of body cam footage.CLIPr’s technology now automatically generates the first draft of a police report from body cam videos, slashing the time officers must spend on paperwork. As Humphrey explains, this means police can focus more on patrol and less on administrative burdens. By integrating seamlessly with body camera providers, CLIPr simplifies uploading, ensures searchability, and maintains accuracy—capturing what’s said, not just what’s seen.The reception from law enforcement has been overwhelmingly positive. Departments now go straight to discussing pricing, not just possibilities—a clear sign CLIPr solves a real problem. Humphrey hopes this is just the beginning, envisioning future applications for social workers, insurance adjusters, and anyone facing mountains of documentation.
