As the largest messaging application, WhatsApp has more than 1.2 billion users globally and businesses have been using it as part of their communications solutions.When setting up WhatsApp for Business, it is important to have separate phone numbers for personal and business use. This allows users to maintain distinct identities and functionalities for personal and professional interactions within the app.However, with the official invitation of businesses by the company last year, it is being used for more than just internal communications. And with the addition of Snapchat-like functionalities with the new Status feature just last week, WhatsApp can now be used by businesses to interact with their customers even more.Getting Started with WhatsApp BusinessTo harness the full potential of WhatsApp for your business, the first step is to set up a WhatsApp Business account. This process is straightforward and can be done through the WhatsApp Business App or the WhatsApp Business Platform. While you can use your existing personal WhatsApp account, it’s advisable to use a separate phone number for your business account to keep personal and business communications distinct.Setting Up Your WhatsApp Business AccountSetting up your WhatsApp Business Account is a breeze with the WhatsApp Business App, a free-to-download app available on both Android and iOS. Here’s how you can get started:Download the App: Head to the Google Play Store or Apple App Store and download the WhatsApp Business App.Create a Business Account: Open the app and tap on “Create a Business Account”.Verify Your Number: Enter your business phone number and verify it through an SMS or phone call.Fill Out Your Profile: Complete your business profile by entering your business name, address, and hours of operation.Add Visuals: Upload a profile picture and cover photo that represents your business.By following these steps, you’ll have a fully functional WhatsApp Business Account ready to connect with your customers.Creating a Professional Business ProfileYour WhatsApp Business Profile is the digital face of your business. It’s crucial to create a professional and trustworthy profile to make a positive first impression on your customers. Here are some tips to help you craft a compelling business profile:Clear Business Name: Use a business name that clearly represents what you do.High-Quality Profile Picture: Choose a high-quality profile picture that reflects your brand.Compelling Description: Write a concise and engaging business description, including your business hours, address, and contact information.Showcase with a Cover Photo: Add a cover photo that highlights your products or services.Keep It Updated: Regularly update your profile to ensure all information is current and accurate.A well-crafted business profile not only builds trust but also makes it easier for customers to connect with your business.Verifying Your Business AccountVerifying your WhatsApp Business Account is a crucial step in establishing credibility and trust with your customers. A verified account signals to customers that your business is legitimate. Here’s how you can verify your account:Access Verification: Go to your WhatsApp Business Profile and tap on “Verify Business”.Fill Out the Form: Complete the verification form with your business information, including your business license or tax ID number.Upload Documents: Submit the required documents to verify your business.Wait for Approval: Wait for WhatsApp to review and verify your business account.Once verified, your business account will display a verification badge, enhancing your credibility with customers.How to Use Whatsapp Business App for BusinessHere are some ways your small business can use WhatsApp and the new Status feature to market your products and services and better engage with your customers. It is important to use separate phone numbers for your personal and business accounts to maintain distinct identities and functionalities within the app.Real-time Customer ServiceLet’s face it, providing real-time customer service is a luxury small businesses cannot afford, but with WhatsApp you and your small staff can answer any questions your customers might have quickly. And because the app supports rich media, you can use text, audio or video to provide a personal customer service experience.Customer SupportSmall businesses provide a multitude of services, and whether you are an electrician, carpenter, or repairing computers, you can create video presentations for your customers. These can be easy how-tos of tasks they can perform on their own that don’t require a professional or something else.The customer support can also extend to live-video help or tutorials to fix something or provide guidance. This will make your company a reliable resource customers can count on, and when they need extended services, you will be well-positioned to be the one they call first.FeedbackThe open rate for WhatsApp messages is 70 percent. So instead of calling customers for feedback, you can create questions for your group that will deliver answers that are relevant to your business. This is marketing research at its best, and it is free.With the feedback you receive from your customers, you can respond to their requests and improve the products and services you provide. By developing creative and entertaining questionnaires, you can interact with your customers in a way that is not intrusive. And their input can be of great value, which can be rewarded with special offers and coupons to encourage future engagement, brand loyalty and long term customer retention.Personal TouchAs your WhatsApp group continues to grow, you can personalize the interaction with your customers using one-on-one communication. This is especially important for small businesses, because you can have a direct relationship, where customers can message you if they need a particular product, have a question or need support.WhatsApp can be accessed on your smartphone, tablet or PC, so you will be able to talk to your customers anytime if you choose to make yourself available.Creating and Targeting GroupsYour small business probably specializes in a particular product or service, and by creating or targeting groups in WhatsApp that are interested in related topics, you can increase your customer base.If you have created video content and provide live-support, members will share it with contacts that are outside of the group. This can lead to more users consuming the content, joining the group and eventually even becoming customers.Share Promotional Codes, Flash SalesWith the new Status feature, you can create special promotional codes your customers can share to redeem at your business. Using the instant photo and location feature, Status can let everyone in your group know about the promotions you are running. This could include a two hour flash sale or a one day special to drive in traffic and create buzz.Based on interaction levels, you can expand the promotion with exclusive coupons or promotions from WhatsApp-Status.Special AccessStatus’s instant interaction capability means you can provide special access to events you are holding and send a live feed. If you have a special guest chef in your restaurant, a musician in your music store or a renowned architect in your firm, you can share this news with your audience.Demo Your ProductWhether you make your own products or just sell them as a retailer, you can demo them on Status and let your group know when you have a new item in your inventory.Even if the customer doesn’t need this particular product now, knowing it is available, what it does, and how to use it will keep the product — and your business — top of mind when the time comes to buy.GiveawaysYou can have weekly, monthly or even daily giveaways to bring foot traffic to your store, or visitors to your website. Since WhatsApp and Status are free, the only cost of such  promotions are the promotional products or services you give away. This considerably lowers the overhead of any marketing venture.Collaborate With Businesses and Partner with InfluencersBy collaborating with nearby businesses and partnering with influencers, you are increasing the number of groups to which you belong. They don’t have to be in the same industry. But with Status, you can become part of all these conversations.Even if members of the other groups aren’t interested in your product or services, they might mention you in conversations on WhatsApp or other social media platforms.Advanced WhatsApp Business StrategiesTo take your WhatsApp Business usage to the next level, consider integrating the WhatsApp Business Platform with your existing business systems. This integration can automate and personalize customer interactions, improve engagement, and drive sales.WhatsApp Business Platform IntegrationThe WhatsApp Business Platform offers powerful tools to integrate WhatsApp with your business systems. Here are some ways to leverage these integrations:CRM Integration: Connect WhatsApp with your CRM system to manage customer interactions and data seamlessly.Marketing Automation: Use marketing automation tools to personalize and automate customer interactions on WhatsApp.Customer Service: Integrate WhatsApp with your customer service software to provide round-the-clock support.E-commerce Integration: Enable customers to make purchases and track orders directly on WhatsApp by integrating it with your e-commerce platform.By integrating WhatsApp with your business systems, you can unlock its full potential, enhancing customer engagement and boosting sales.Final ThoughtsWhatsApp, as a communication tool, continues to evolve and add more features — like Status — with more likely in the future. It is a versatile platform that lets you send files, images, and short video clips about your products and services.However, the key to using WhatsApp effectively is to avoid abusing the relationships you build with your audience. Measure your interactions so each message you send has value. Don’t make every conversation about making a sale. Remember other users have the power to delete your message with a single click.With the new Status feature, WhatsApp is now more valuable than ever for businesses. Use the existing features to provide valuable engagement with your audience as a way of spreading the word about your brand  and learning more about your customers’ needs.WhatsApp Photo via Shutterstock",
