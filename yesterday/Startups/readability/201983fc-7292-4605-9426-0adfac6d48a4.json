Food \u0026 Poison Discrimination Emergence of eyes from single light-sensitive photoreceptors Our digital creatures evolve different eyes based on survival needs - compound-like eyes for navigation, camera-like eyes for food and poison discrimination. Why do eyes have lenses? Our creatures independently discover solutions that nature found - like lenses that focus light - emerging naturally to balance survival pressures and physical constraints of their environment.
