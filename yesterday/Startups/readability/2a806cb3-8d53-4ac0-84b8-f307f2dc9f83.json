  "text": "For John Williamson, co-founder and CEO of the custom song platform Songfinch, the appeal of Buy Now, Pay Later apps has been starting to wear thin.Songfinch customers looking to commission an original ballad for a friend or romantic partner are currently able to use two of the biggest BNPL services on the market—Klarna and Affirm—to split their final bill into multiple payments spread out over time. That is to say: they can buy their Songfinch song now but pay for it later, over the next few weeks.Williamson once hoped that offering this payment plan, as many online retailers have started doing, would open up a new tranche of customers who wouldn’t otherwise shop with him; he envisioned a 25 percent pop in conversion rates.Instead, he tells Inc., on the 15 percent of his sales that he estimates are financed this way, he’s paying around a 6 percent fee on each transaction—double his normal processing fee—without knowing whether it’s actually growing his customer base.“Are people just using Klarna and Affirm because it’s easy and they have accounts set up?” he wonders. “Are we getting sales that we wouldn’t get without that service, or are people that were already going to purchase … just utilizing that, essentially changing a 3 percent transaction to a 6 percent transaction and eating into [our] already thin margin?”It’s the sort of question that startups and small businesses might increasingly confront as these payment plans become more and more mainstream. Installment plans are no modern invention, but the rise of e-commerce has made it easier than ever to integrate them directly into online shopping, and a host of fintech companies have stepped in to do just that: not only Klarna and Affirm (which works with Shopify) but also Afterpay, Zip and Sezzle as well big-name mainstays such as PayPal and, until recently, Apple.The sector has gotten big enough that Klarna is now planning to go public—although the tariffs-related market downturn has now led the company to put those plans on hold. The BNPL powerhouse also recently made news for an integration with DoorDash that, as some skeptics cheekily noted, will let customers finance their burritos in four easy payments.In a report published this January, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimated that in 2022, the year with the most recent available data, there were 277 million American BNPL loans across six different BNPL lenders, worth a total of about $34 billion.The same report found that borrowers with subprime or deep subprime credit scores made up the majority of BNPL loan originations—and indeed, there has been substantial concern about whether these payment models put consumers at unnecessary risk. Less prevalent, however, has been the discussion of what the rise of BNPL means for businesses.“For sure it’s impacting margins,” says Songfinch’s Williamson. “During holiday windows, it probably works as intended for us. It’s during evergreen periods where it’s hit and miss.”What would be great, he adds, is the ability to micro-target BNPL toward customers who wouldn’t otherwise make a purchase. He says that Affirm and Klarna currently offer some limited tools to that effect, such as requiring a minimum cart size at check-out, but he wants more fine-tuning and dynamic targeting.“I’m clearly not anti-buy now, pay later,” he says. (He still lets customers use it, after all.) “I just think that they need to offer more tools in the future to be able to achieve some of these goals that they’re pitching.”Research does suggest that BNPL may increase sales: one recent study in the Journal of Marketing found that these installment plans led to an increase in both the number and value of purchases, especially by alleviating “perceived financial constraints” and “facilitating budget control.”However, the same researchers caution that their findings also suggest that the increased spending is mostly “from consumers who are financially constrained and rely on credit cards,” such that it’s important “to be cautious about who to offer BNPL schemes to.”A Klarna spokesperson tells Inc. that merchant fees are “broadly in line with the cost of processing a credit card,” pointing to a recent study by the payment processor Stripe which found that offering BNPL increased revenue by up to 14 percent and that “more than two-thirds of BNPL volume came from net-new sales.” The spokesperson adds that Klarna offers merchants “a range of tools” to connect them with customers.Meanwhile, Affirm’s chief revenue officer said in a blog post last month that the company’s partners reported a 70 percent increase in average cart sizes last year, with “nearly 30 percent fewer abandoned carts compared to other BNPL providers.” The company’s president has also previously said that their underwriting engine tailors payment plans to each customer, giving consumers more purchasing power and retailers more growth opportunities.James Langer, the co-founder and CEO of the air filter manufacturer Serionix, pointed to another issue he’s run into with BNPL services: customers not knowing what they’re signing up for.“Overall it has been a fine experience, but we have had issues come up on multiple occasions particularly related to customer confusion regarding the charges,” he says of his Shopify BNPL integration. “Several customers have reached out to us about bank charges they don’t recognize or weren’t expecting, and initially it was difficult for us to track down why these customers were seeing charges months after their product order.”There also lies some risk in reminding customers of their purchases over and over again, Langer says. He thinks brands should ask themselves: “How will my customer feel being reminded of their purchase with charges every 1/2/3 months, and are we prepared to respond if their initial enthusiasm fades?”Sangwook Park—co-founder and CEO of the tooth-whitening brand Laughland Sciences—says that customer disputes do seem to be more common among customers who use BNPL at check-out.“We haven’t had much difficulty with the service, but we have noticed higher sales disputes when they checkout,” adds Park, whose company offers Afterpay.A spokesperson for Afterpay said that there is minimal risk to its retail clients, as the fintech company pays companies upfront for purchases made through its service and takes on the risk of chargebacks and fraud. The platform generally increases merchant sales, the spokesperson added.The team at kid-safe phone company Gabb Wireless, meanwhile, explored a BNPL service three years ago, but found it to be costly and tough to implement. “Our first solution ended up being more of a distraction than something that improved conversion,” recalls vice president of infrastructure Jarid Love. After about six months, Gabb stopped using it–although they’ve since implemented their own solution.Other small businesses have more positive things to say about BNPL.Michael Duff, CEO of the beauty brand In Your Face Skincare, said he’s had zero issues with both AfterPay and Shopify’s BNPL program, while Jim Higdon, co-founder of the hemp cannabinoid brand Cornbread Hemp, described a generally positive experience using Sezzle.“These apps aren’t perfect,” Higdon says, “but some customers expect them.”The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
