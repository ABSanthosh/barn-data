  "text": "Watch out, Elon. Although X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, is still the leader of short-form, text-based social media, Meta’s Threads is coming for its crown. New data from digital market intelligence company Similarweb shows Threads a close second to X when compared by number of worldwide daily active users on iOS and Android. For June 2025, X had about 132 million daily active users, which represents a decline of about 15 percent year-over-year, while Threads had some 115 million users—a jump of close to 128 percent year-over-year. Although Bluesky occupied a distant third, its daily active users via iPhone and Android apps grew close to 373 percent year-over-year, to just over 4 million in June 2025.On a monthly basis, Similarweb estimates that Threads already has more iOS and Android users than X. Threads had about 408 million users in June 2025 compared with X’s 311 million, according to the digital market intelligence company. When combining both the web and app audience on a monthly basis, however, X still pulls well ahead.“As a spin-off of Instagram, I suspect Threads puts most of its emphasis on winning loyal users of the mobile app. They didn’t even have a real web version of the app for the first few months after Threads launched,” Similarweb editor of insights, news, and research David Carr says via email. “They’re gaining by one of the metrics that is most important to them.”X led across four categories of Similarweb data that, as TechCrunch reported, compared the three platforms in terms of daily active app users in the U.S. and worldwide, and average daily web visits in the U.S. and worldwide. Although Threads generally came in second, Bluesky overtook it in one category: average daily web visits in the U.S. Bluesky had some 2.4 million daily web visits in June 2025, which represents a jump of close to 1,100 percent year-over-year. Threads had about 985,000 average daily web visits that month, whereas X tallied some 33 million in that same period. It’s also worth noting that Threads and Bluesky demonstrated substantially greater growth rates than X in each category.The service formerly known as Twitter has been embroiled in controversy since Elon Musk purchased it in October 2022 for $44 billion. Musk laid off some 80 percent of staff, including its content moderation and communications teams, and loosened content moderation policies. Dozens of major advertisers paused or withdrew advertising out of fear their ads would appear next to extremist content. Amid the turmoil at X, Threads and Bluesky emerged as competitors. Bluesky, which was originally started by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey as a side project within Twitter, benefitted from another exodus of X users that occurred after Musk allied himself with President Trump in the run-up to the 2024 election. The company’s valuation reportedly fell by roughly 56 percent in the 12 months after the acquisition. Since then, however, X has reportedly bounced back. Musk’s AI company xAI acquired it in March in an all-stock deal for $45 billion and $12 billion in debt.The final deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, July 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
