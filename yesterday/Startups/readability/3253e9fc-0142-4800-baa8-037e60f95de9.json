The park was first announced in 2019 and cost around $7 billion to create, per CNBC.Casandra Matej, CEO of Visit Orlando, told CNBC the new park is \"the first major, entirely new theme park in the U.S. in 25 years.\" Research seen by the outlet from Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Forecasting, found that within one year of opening, the new park could generate around $2 billion for Florida and create more than 17,500 new jobs across the country.At 750 acres, it's the largest of all of Universal's properties and features five themed worlds: Celestial Park, Dark Universe, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter – Ministry of Magic, Super Nintendo World, and How to Train Your Dragon – Isle of Berk. But don't worry, Harry Potter fans: This is the third Harry Potter-related theme park Universal has in the area. Nearby, Explore Hogsmeade is still open at Universal Islands of Adventure, and Diagon Alley is also open at Universal Studios Florida.

There are also several boat rides.Guests ride Stardust Racers, a new dueling roller coaster ride in Celestial Park, during a preview day for Universal Epic Universe on April 5, 2025, in Orlando, Florida.
