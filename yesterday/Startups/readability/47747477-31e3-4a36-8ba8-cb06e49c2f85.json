They transform nutrients and make them accessible for plant uptake, support above-ground biodiversity, and store carbon. However, changing weather patterns are also causing changes in the diversity of the microbiome, threatening global systems. To maintain healthy soils, it is important to monitor them and identify any invasive species. This is where Soilytix comes in. Soilytix monitors and analyses soil biodiversity, including levels of bacteria, fungi, and microfauna, and helps companies use this data to maximise crop yields and measure carbon removal potentials. For example, the company is working with supermarkets to enable them to accurately monitor the impact of regenerative practices used by farms within their supply chain. An AI-assisted soil sampling app allows clients to collect soil samples and send them to Soilytix’s lab for analysis. The company extracts the DNA of microorganisms in the sample and conducts DNA sequencing to identify and quantify any bacteria, fungi, and microfauna. After a thorough bioinformatic and statistical analysis, Soilytix creates a qualitative and quantitative “fingerprint” of the soil. This information is available to clients on the company’s MySoil Dashboard where they can use it to inform decision-making and assess the effect of land management changes on soil health. Soilytix has conducted projects with major companies and agencies around the globe and is also engaged in the academic sector, licensing the MySoil Dashboard to universities and agronomists.
