  "text": "One Silicon Valley solar disruptor just landed $50 million to make ultra-thin and efficient solar panels.San Jose, California-based Tandem PV announced on Tuesday a $50 million series A round of funding, led by VC fund Eclipse, with participation from Constellation Energy, Planetary Technologies, Uncorrelated Ventures, former SunPower CEO Tom Werner, and others. The funding, a mixture of equity and debt, brings the company’s total funding raised to date to $83 million. CEO Scott Wharton says Tandem plans to use the $50 million to commercialize its unique solar panels through ongoing research and development, establishing a customer base, and building out a factory capable of producing full-scale panels. The bright idea behind the technology is that in addition to using silicon, they also contain perovskite.“The main goal of this funding is to show that we can prove both the full product working and also the customer demand, and then we can scale up to this billion-dollar-a-year scale, which is pretty exciting,” Wharton says.Perovskite solar panels are different from the silicon-based models currently dominating the market. They are thinner and feature a crystalline structure that absorbs certain colors of light very efficiently, according to the Department of Energy. And an added bonus is that they have the potential to reduce a reliance on minerals like silver.Kristina Zagame, senior home electrification analyst at EnergySage, a U.S. clean energy marketplace that connects homeowners with vetted installers, called perovskite solar technology a “game changer” for both cost and sustainability. “By not relying on silicon, perovskite has the potential to lower costs and make clean energy more accessible to residences and businesses — especially with new advances in converting agricultural byproducts to fuel this technology,” she said in an emailed statement. “While some durability and efficiency challenges remain, continued research could bring this promising technology to market.”As Zagame pointed out, perovskite panels are largely still in development, but Tandem’s panels are something of a hybrid, containing both silicon and perovskite. Wharton says the material can increase efficiency by about 30 percent. He compares the technology to electric vehicles. “There was a gas car, then there was a hybrid, then you go all-electric. This is an interim period where we’re having perovskite plus silicon, and that essentially allows us to capture more light collectively than you could with one or the other,” Wharton says. “In the future, we’ll be all perovskite.”Wharton says there’s a real imperative to continuing to innovate in solar energy, particularly when the technology has the potential to reduce costs and reliance on materials sourced elsewhere. China, for example, is currently the world leader in solar panel manufacturing, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Given that utility-scale photovoltaic solar is already the “least costly option for new electricity generation in a significant majority of countries worldwide,” the IEA reports, Wharton expects further cost reductions will lead to more uptake industry-wide.It’s “old-fashioned American ingenuity and innovation,” Wharton says. “If you make it cheaper, people are going to buy more solar energy.”Wharton says Tandem PV is currently in the process of building the factory, and expects to produce commercially available panels as soon as early 2026.The application deadline for Inc.'s Best Workplaces Awards is this Friday, March 7, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
