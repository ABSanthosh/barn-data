Venturelli added, “Hell Clock is also a very personal project for all of us at Rogue Snail. In my 17-year career, this is my first project primarily voiced in Brazilian Portuguese, and also based entirely on Brazilian history and culture. We feel like we’re ready to tell our version of the Canudos story — not only to the whole world, but also to many fellow Brazilians who might not be fully aware of its grim events and repercussions which can still be felt to this day.” Hell Clock features Hell Clock is set in Brazil’s 19th century War of Canudos.
