You’re the CEO. You control the acoustic treatment, too.Please read on to find out about the equipment for the place.What Studio Equipment Do I Need to Set up a Home Recording Studio or Podcast Studio?Home studios need different pieces of equipment. All the gear should be industry standard for music or podcasts. Below is a list of the recording equipment and other things you need.ComputerDon’t cut any corners. The software uses a lot of resources. It doesn’t matter in the end whether you choose a computer that uses MacOS or Windows. Most of the software, like DAWS, is compatible with either.When it comes to technology for storage devices, choose SSDs over classic hard drives. They perform better.The size of the storage device is important. For consistent good sound quality, a minimum of one terabyte is recommended. However, starting with 512 GB of space is also acceptable.Studio MonitorsThere are several good features for studio monitors for a home studio.Bigger rooms need 8-inch monitors minimum.A small room can get by with 3 to 5-inch units. Get a fan, too.A medium-sized space should have 5 to eight-inch monitors.Power is another consideration. This is what drives the woofer and tweeter and generates sound quality. The monitor drivers need enough power for sharp and/or punchy sound.For smaller rooms, look for power requirements of 20 Watts. Medium rooms take a 40-watt monitor. A bigger space can go up to 80 Watts or higher.Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)A digital audio workstation (DAW) is digital software that allows you to compose, edit, and record audio tracks.Here are a few features that are standard for these pieces of equipment. A good DAW has audio arrangement and recording features. One worth the money is a plug-and-play experience.Look forAudio Plugins. These control the virtual instruments, reverberation, equalization, and delay.MIDI Controllers. These look after messages for audio signals like velocity and volume. You adjust the treatment.Other features should look after producing, mixing, tracking, and composing.An industry leader in Logic Pro X. This tool provides digital instruments and audio effects mimicking real musicians. Look for sample libraries, too.Here are some of the other pieces you’ll need.PreampsThese work with microphone levels. A good audio interface comes with a preamp built in. They boost a microphone level to a line level. You can get standalone versions or ones built into the audio interface.Studio HeadphonesA home studio should have two different headphones. Closed-back headphones are used for recording. Open-back headphones are used for mixing.For closed-back headphones, seek out products with maximum sound insulation properties. On the other hand, open-back headphones deliver good sound quality with isolation.Each serves different studio purposes.Studio MicrophonesYou’ll also need good microphones. These are important for podcasts. The following list supplies some of the best choices.Dynamic MicrophonesThese are also known as moving coil microphones. They are rugged, affordable, and don’t require a power source like a battery. A disadvantage is they are less accurate than a condenser microphone.Here’s a list to sort through.Condenser MicCondenser microphones are another option. Many experts favor audio recording in a home studio because they deliver excellent sound quality for both music and vocals.These also have outstanding low-frequency responses.USBThese microphones are a user-friendly option for home studio use. The best models blend simplicity with high-quality recording capabilities. Some even come with additional software, but many of these microphones are simply plug-and-play.Here’s a list of products that supply great sound for podcasting.XLRThis type of microphone comes with a preamp. The audio quality is better than other types of microphone. It’s great for recording musical instruments. The XLR is the standard that is used in many professional recording studios. It’s adaptable and customizable.Microphone AccessoriesFollowing are the microphone accessories you’ll need.Mic CablesFirst off, you’ll need to know the difference between digital and analog cables.Analog cables transmit data through electricity.Digital cables use binary code.The electrical signal from analog cables gets passed through instruments or other gear to speakers and monitors. Cones vibrate and push air to your ears.Digital signals are created by computers which is a machine language. A digital signal can be changed in many different ways.Learn more about those choices here.Mic StandsThese are excellent investments for your home studio. Generally, you can spend as little as $10 or more than $500. Here are a few of the mic stand options you have.Tripod stands are good for general use.Overhead stands are the most expensive.Tripod boom stands offer a bigger reach.Desktop stands work for podcasting.Low-profile and round base stands are two of the other mic stand options.Midi KeyboardThese are important for production and just playing in your home. Here are a few boxes to check to get a good one.Software integration needs to be at the top of the list. You’ll need to be able to have control over your DAW or virtual instruments.Having a reliable driver is essential. If it causes your computer or software to crash, you won’t be able to record effectively. Take some time to research the manufacturer.One of the most important features is the keys. Look for high-quality synth-action products.Don’t forget to look for pitch and modulation controls, too.Pop ShieldThese enhancements improve the quality of the tracks you record by eliminating plosives, speech sounds, and mechanical popping noises. While metal screens tend to be more expensive, they offer significant benefits.SamplesAudio samples are necessary for your home studio. They can include everything from sharp piano loops to a snare hit.Audio InterfaceThe audio interface can do a number of things, like recording music and streaming podcasts. It connects your gear to the DAW through your computer.Select your audio interface based on connections, budget, and physical design.Here’s a list of some of the best.Editing SoftwarePodcast editing software should include features for music too. Look for :A number of different audio effects and music that’s royalty-free for your podcast.A free trial is a nice software option for a live-streaming production.The ability to remove any background noise is good.Industry leaders like TwistedWave offer editing software for a Mac, iPhone/iPad or online. You can launch it from a browser.Monitor SpeakersThese are critical for your home setup. Here are a few ideas on choosing good monitor speakers. There are two different types.Near-Field Monitor SpeakersThese use a dome-shaped tweeter and a cone woofer. They are small with a wide range and work best 3 to 4 feet apart. Some can lack a deep base. But you can make up with a good sub woofer.Active MonitorsThese have a power amplifier built in. That makes them the best choice for a home studio setup. Most of these are bi-amplified. One amp is for the tweeter, and one is for the woofer. That means you’ll get more sound power.Acoustic TreatmentsDon’t underestimate your room’s acoustics. It’s important to make a distinction with the pro tools you’ll need. Soundproofing is designed to minimize the noise that travels in a room. It uses dense building materials.Acoustic treatments do something completely different. They are designed to control the sound in a room and make it better.For good acoustic treatments, look at three items.Diffusers work to scatter frequencies.Bass Traps absorb sound with low frequencies.Acoustic Panels absorb high and middle frequencies.Primacoustic is an industry leader.Ear Training SoftwareFor good recordings, your ears need to develop basic skills. Sound engineers recognize bands of frequencies. Musicians can pick out chords, intervals, and notes. This software will allow you to make mixing decisions that make your final product better.Pop FiltersA pop filter is a straightforward tool. Simply put, it’s the gear that goes between the microphone and the singer/speaker. A pop filter contains a mesh screen that slows air to reduce plosives. These are speech sounds that get recorded otherwise.There are generally two options. Cheap screens and more expensive metal ones.InstrumentsConsider looking into virtual instruments. A single software tool provides hundreds of instrument sounds. Just starting out? Look for a single keyboard program and a good drum option.Desk Work StationWhen you’re looking for a desk workstation to bring everything together, there are a few features to check off. Like the following:Find one with a smaller upper shelf to house monitors.Rollers, so you can move it around.A tray that slides out for storing a keyboard and mouse.Remember, as your home studio expands, you’ll need more rack space.Basic Office EquipmentHere’s a quick refresher checklist of the basic equipment you’ll need.The Computer. Go with at least 8 GB RAM to start.Studio Monitors. Remember that active speakers produce a flat frequency response. And that’s what you want.DAW Software. You can get free versions. But you’ll get limited functionality. Look for a company offering subscriptions.Audio Interface. Basically, this is an analog-to-digital sound converter, so your DAW can do its job.Headphones: There are two types available: closed-back headphones, which are ideal for recording, and open-back headphones, which are better suited for mixing.Microphones: The condenser mic can be used for both instruments and vocals.XLR Cables: If you’re starting out, you won’t have a lot of money. Get three. One for your microphone and two for the monitors.Pop Filters: These ‘mesh’ screens filter out unwanted vocal noises.Here’s a final thought. Try to avoid setting up in a small room. The acoustics are never very good.Setting Up a Home Recording StudioAre you a small business owner ready to set up a recording space? YouTube is a great platform to use. Using this platform means making the most of location, lighting, and sound.Get your setup right, and the possibilities are endless. Here are a few things about the style and elements of the set to create a mood.Can You Have a Recording Studio at Home?The answer is yes if you follow all the advice and suggestions in this article. You’ll need the right software, space, and gear.How Much Does a Home Studio Cost?A budget is important. And for that you’ll need to know the cost involved. The quick answer is somewhere between $500 and $20,000 dollars.Still, experts say it depends on what you’re looking to accomplish. A good set of speakers and a computer can get a lot done with little money.If you want something more professional with several mics and preamps, you could be looking at the $5000 to $50,000 range.How To Set Up a Home Recording StudioSetting up a recording space is a process. You can start with an idea, some money, and a dedicated place. Then, you should follow the following steps.Choose the Perfect Room for Your Recording SpaceAn area in your recording space is the first decision. Here are a few ideas to point you in the right direction.Avoid small rooms. Bigger rooms allow for an expanding collection of instruments and gear. They also sound and show better.Stay away from spaces with outside noise like plumbing, neighbors, and cars.Choose concrete and tile over carpet. Carpets are bad for low frequencies.Stay away from bedrooms because the acoustics are poor.Make Sure the Room is SoundproofedYou need to soundproof your space. It’s a DIY project you can finish in three steps.Sound escapes in gaps in window frames and doors. Add door sweeps and seal leaks with acoustical sealant. Hang thick curtains around windows. Don’t forget to line the heating and cooling ducts.You can increase the mass of the walls and ceiling with special soundproof wall panels. Adding a second layer of drywall is another option.Suppose you can mount electrical switches on the wall. This takes away a sound entry point.Have the Perfect Recording Studio DesignHaving the right design makes a big difference. Take everything out of the room you’ve picked. That includes anything that can vibrate. Next, you should add acoustic treatment. It’s not just for show.The standard setup has all the gear surrounding you in a circle. It’s good for access.The other option is a dual setup. There’s a station for the engineer and another section for the musician.The hybrid setup looks most like the dual option.Top Tips for the Perfect Home Recording StudioHaving trouble getting started? Here are five tips that will point you in the right direction for starting out.Starting with the basics is a good idea. Look for gear that’s both affordable and compact. Get reviews sent to your inbox via mail.If you plan on making music or podcasts on the go, you’ll need a laptop. If your home recording space is going to be stationary, a desktop PC will do.Choosing the right DAW software is important. If you own a Mac computer, you can start with the basics and upgrade to Logic Pro X.When you’re looking at an audio interface, think about inputs. The minimum 2 out/2 in the units works best.If you plan on doing a lot of live streams, a USB microphone is the right choice.Home Podcast Studio SetupSetting up a podcast studio is a little different. Here are a few things that make this different from recording music.Planning is the first step. You need to write a script that goes along with your original idea. You might even need to invite some people in as guests.Some people might want to pick a cohost. It’s easier to get started with one of these.You need to choose a name. Choose one that will let you expand your topics. For example, “Outdoor Adventures” could be about hiking. But you can expand it.You need to have a format, too. A simple one includes a teaser and some intro music and then an ad spot and an interview.Don’t forget to leave yourself enough time to edit the episode. That way, it will sound its best.How Does a Podcast Studio Work?Generally, podcasting is a free service. Users get to take the audio files that are usually MP3s. They listen to them on their smartphones or other devices.Podcasting is free from any government regulation presently. You don’t need to buy any kind of license like a radio station would. You don’t need to conform to any FCC regulations, either.How Much Does a Home Podcast Studio Cost?Much of this will depend on whether you’re looking to start a podcast as a hobby or a business. Either way, you’re going to need equipment, software, cover art as well as music and FX.For the business podcast you can spend on average $950 to get started and then $330 a month for things like podcast hosting.For the hobby podcast, the startup fee is around $330, with $15 per month.How to Set Up a Home Podcast StudioSetting up a DIY podcast area is quite straightforward. However, there are several steps you can take to ensure a successful launch. The tips below will guide you in getting started.Choose the Right Room for Your Home Podcast StudioChoosing the right space for your podcast is the first step. Here’s the thing.

Think about access.Lots of podcasters start recording in their closets.Stay away from rooms that have hard flooring, like your kitchen and other hard surfaces.Soundproof or Soundtreat Your RoomSoundproofing differs from sound treatment. Soundproofing focuses on reducing external noise in your home studio. To achieve this, you can utilize specially designed drywall panels and gap fillers.Sound treating is about making the acoustics in the room better. Use tools like bass traps here which are tools that dampen low frequencies. These are a big part of success.Choose Your Room LayoutHere are some more ideas for choosing your room layout. Along with the tips we’ve already mentioned, watch out for low ceilings and parallel walls using drywall.Start Recording!If you’ve gone through all these tips, you’re ready to start recording.
