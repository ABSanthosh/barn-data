  "text": "There’s no doubt about it—your morning routine determines how your entire day will unfold. If you get off to a bad start, then you’ll be challenged the rest of the day to turn it around. But get off to a good start, and you’re well on the way to a great day. Once you have a morning routine in place, it pays to stick with it. As research shows, when your morning routine is disrupted, you’ll feel less focused. You’ll be less productive. Even missing your morning cup of coffee can leave you feeling less calm and more mentally exhausted. Implementing a deliberate morning routine can significantly boost your energy levels at work, along with your concentration and efficiency. Here are five habits to adopt to begin your day with meaningful direction and energy. 1. Break up with the snooze button. The snooze button you keep hitting actually works against your best interests. Hitting the snooze button causes you to enter a new sleep cycle. This prevents completion of the previous one, causing greater disorientation and fatigue than waking up right away.  Ultimately, hitting the snooze reduces your effectiveness during morning tasks. If you’re having a hard time breaking up with your snooze button, then set your alarm for your true wakeup time. Put your alarm clock on the other side of your room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off. 2. Hydrate before you caffeinate. Your body is in desperate need of hydration after going seven to eight hours without water. Drinking 16 ounces of water first thing in the morning rehydrates your system while activating your metabolism and assisting in detoxification.  If you’re one of those people who snores or breathes through their mouth during sleep, you especially need morning hydration. Consider adding a squeeze of lemon to your water to provide a shot of vitamin C that will aid digestion. Remember that drinking room-temperature water is a gentler introduction to your system first thing in the morning than cold water. 3. Practice mindfulness. Just five minutes of meditation or deep breathing can transform your mental state for the better ahead of a busy workday. Engaging in a mindfulness practice lowers the stress hormone cortisol while enhancing mental clarity and focus. This leads to improved decision-making capabilities throughout the day.  The habit of mindfulness meditation can be built through apps like Headspace or Calm and simple breathing exercises that you can be found online. 4. Fuel your body strategically. What you consume for breakfast has a substantial effect on your energy throughout the day. Choose a balanced breakfast with protein and healthy fats alongside complex carbohydrates to maintain steady energy throughout the morning.  Avoid the temptation to eat sugary food. (I’m looking at you Honey Smacks and Cap’n Crunch.) These foods only lead to sudden energy spikes followed by crashes. Choose breakfast combinations such as Greek yogurt topped with nuts and berries, or avocado toast served with eggs and overnight oats mixed with nut butter. If you’re not all that hungry first thing in the morning, then prepare a snack you can consume within the first hour of your day. 5. Set an intentional focus. Before checking your email or social media, pause for a moment to determine your top priority for the day. When you establish a clear intention, you create direction for yourself. This enables you to actively shape your daily activities instead of simply reacting to them. Place your daily intention somewhere visible at your workspace to maintain focus on what is important despite inevitable interruptions and obligations. When you consistently stick to morning routines, you will have more energy during your workday, as well as improved happiness and well-being. You’ll experience lower levels of anxiety and stress. In short, you’ll be in command of your day, which is something we can all use a lot more of.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",
