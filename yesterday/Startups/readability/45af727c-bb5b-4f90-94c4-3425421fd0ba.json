  "text": "If your business is fast-growing, it’s time to get the recognition you’ve earned—apply now to the 2025 Inc. Regionals program. Companies that made at least $1 million in 2023 can apply to be recognized as a growth leader specifically in their home region. The deadline to apply is December 6, 2024, and honorees will appear on Inc.com in late March 2025. Here is what you need to know about Inc.’s annual Regionals program. 1. What is Inc. Regionals? This list of emerging companies is an extension of the Inc. 5000, which lists the 5,000 fastest-growing companies in the US. Inc. Regionals dives deeper and ranks the fastest growing companies in seven distinct regions. For 2025, there are seven Inc. Regionals lists: Mid-Atlantic (DE, MD, DC, VA, WV, and NC), Midwest (IL, IN, IA, KS, MI, MN, MO, NE, ND, OH, SD, and WI), Northeast (PA, NY, VT, NH, ME, MA, CT, RI, and NJ), Pacific (CA, OR, WA, HI, and AK), Rocky Mountains (MT, ID, WY, NV, UT, and CO), Southeast (SC, KY, TN, GA, AR, AL, MS, LA, FL, and Puerto Rico), Southwest (AZ. NM, OK, and TX). 2. Who qualifies for Inc. Regionals? All of the following must be true of your company in order to qualify for the 2025 Inc. Regionals. Your company must: Be privately held, for-profit; based in the U.S., and independent (not a subsidiary or division of another company). Have generated revenue by March 31, 2021. Have generated at least $100,000 in revenue in 2021. Have generated $1 million in revenue in 2023. Revenue in 2023 exceeds revenue in 2021. 3. How does Inc. Regionals rank companies? Companies are ranked according to the percentage growth of their annual revenue over a two-year period. To assess this, we ask for your 2021 and 2023 revenues. This gives us a two-year growth period, using 2021 as a base year for growth. The equation for growth percentage is: [(recent yearly revenue – base year revenue) / base year revenue] x 100 = total growth percentage For example, if 2021 revenue was $3 million and 2023 revenue was $15 million:  $15 million – $3 million = $12 million 12,000,000 / 3,000,000 = 4      4 x 100 = 400 The growth rate is 400 percent. 4. Is there a fee to apply? Yes. There is a non-refundable processing fee of $395. Identifying the fastest-growing private companies in the U.S. by region is an enormous editorial project that, among other things, raises awareness of entrepreneurship as a valuable force in our economy. The processing fee covers only a portion of the operational costs of this undertaking. Refund Policy: If you need to cancel your application, just get in touch with us by replying to your confirmation email or emailing us at incregionals@inc.com. All sales are final. Refunds are not available but you can receive a credit for your 2026 Inc. Regionals Application. The deadline to cancel applications is December 6 at 11:59 PM PST. 5. Why should my company apply? You can find five great reasons to apply right here. Apply for the Inc. Regionals list today!",
