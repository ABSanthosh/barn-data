  "text": "Verizon has announced significant new benefits for military personnel, introducing a short-term military suspension option that could be a game changer for small businesses operated by military families. The timing couldn’t be better, as many small business owners look for ways to better support their military employee base or even manage their own operations when encountering deployment-related disruptions. The new Military Short Term Suspend option allows deployed customers to temporarily suspend their mobile service for deployments under 90 days. During this period, they will pay only $10 per month or their regular service charge—whichever is lower. This short-term flexibility could provide crucial cost savings, allowing small business owners who are deployed to keep their lines active without incurring hefty fees. “Members of our military in training or on short-term national missions deserve a solution tailored to their needs,” said Sowmyanarayan Sampath, CEO of Verizon Consumer. This initiative reflects Verizon’s commitment to providing personalized support to military members and their families, thus setting a new standard for customer care in the telecommunications industry. For longer deployments, Verizon also offers options for suspending service between 90 days and three years, enabling users to avoid charges for services and device payments during the suspension. The ability for small business owners to retain essential services while managing costs can enhance their operations significantly during uncertain times. Moreover, Verizon is also rolling out exclusive offers for military personnel, including four lines at $25 each per month through their Unlimited Welcome plan and Fios Home Internet from just $45 per month with Auto Pay. For those who combine mobile and internet services, an additional $15 discount on Fios Home Internet brings their monthly cost down to $30. These savings can significantly aid small business owners in managing operational costs, especially in tumultuous times of deployment. Verizon is also committed to supporting the professional development of military members, providing extensive tools and resources to enhance skill sets for post-service careers. “We have established standards in network reliability, options, and innovation on behalf of our customers,” added Sampath. This approach not only helps military families navigate their unique challenges but also enhances the overall community standing of businesses that prioritize inclusion and support. While these benefits provide exciting opportunities, small business owners should consider the potential challenges as well. The verification process for discounts could present some administrative hurdles. Owners might need to invest time in understanding the eligibility requirements and how to facilitate them for their employees. Additionally, there may be hidden costs or limitations tied to device handling, as customers have to either pay off or return any remaining device balance when suspending services. Verizon’s latest initiative highlights a growing trend among telecommunications companies to embrace niche markets such as military families. This evolution promises more tailored customer experiences, especially for those who serve in the military. For small business owners, leveraging these resources can lead to improved support for military personnel among their staff, thereby enhancing retention and creating a loyal customer base. In a world where connectivity can dictate business success, particularly for small businesses offering remote services, these new options from Verizon empower owners to navigate deployment challenges more effectively. As they work to foster an inclusive environment for their military-affiliated employees, small businesses can tap into Verizon’s offerings as a means of enhancing not just employee satisfaction but overall operational resilience.
