  "text": "The feud between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk could have real-world implications for the U.S. space program.Following Elon Musk’s departure from his role in the Trump administration, he came out swinging against Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” by calling it, among other things, the “Big Ugly Spending Bill.” After that, a very public face off between Trump and Musk on their respective social-media platforms, Truth Social and X, got more pointed.“The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump wrote in a Thursday post on Truth Social. “I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!”Sharing a screenshot of that post, Musk then posted on X: “In light of the President’s statement about cancellation of my government contracts, SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.” (That post has since been deleted.)But later, Musk walked back those threats on X, writing that SpaceX “won’t decommission Dragon.”Even so, these threats demonstrate the high stakes of this very public blowout. And it raises the questions: What is the Dragon spacecraft, and why is it so crucial to the functioning of the U.S. space program?What is the Dragon spacecraft?SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft is a crewed capsule capable of carrying several passengers from Earth to orbit and beyond. The first private spacecraft to carry humans to the International Space Station (ISS), Dragon began ferrying astronauts back in 2020. Since then, it has completed 51 total missions, including 46 visits to the ISS.It launches on top of a Falcon 9 rocket. Dragon is crucial to U.S. space accessThe Crew Dragon spacecraft was produced through NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, a public-private partnership to develop safe and affordable U.S. transportation to and from space. Both SpaceX and rival Boeing received billions in federal funding to create manned spacecraft after NASA’s final space shuttle mission in 2011. SpaceX successfully flew the Dragon capsule in 2020, marking a return to manned spaceflight from U.S. soil, whereas Boeing’s Starliner conducted its first crewed mission in mid-2024 after years of delays. The mission infamously failed (at least in part), leaving astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore in space for months until a SpaceX Dragon ferried them back to Earth in mid-March.Boeing’s shortcomings are SpaceX’s strengthsBecause of Boeing’s issues, Dragon is currently the only U.S. vehicle capable of carrying U.S. astronauts and supplies to the space station. During the period between 2011 and 2020, before Dragon entered the scene, the U.S. would buy flights on a Russian spacecraft. In spite of strained relations between the U.S. and Russia, Space.com reported that the two nations’ space programs have ongoing arrangements through 2025 “for continued safe operations of the space station.” It isn’t clear whether these agreements extend beyond 2025, but the ISS is expected to be decommissioned in 2030.All of this means that it’s beneficial for the integrity of the U.S. space program that Musk has backed down, for now, on his threat to decommission Dragon.The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, June 27, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
