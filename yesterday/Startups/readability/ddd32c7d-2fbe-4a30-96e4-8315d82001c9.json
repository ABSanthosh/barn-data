The data revealed that productivity has gone up by about 2%, and employees tend to work in productive 24-minute bursts. The months with the most hours worked (around nine a day on average) were August and December. Mauch noted to Bloomberg that August was due to a post-vacation work rush and December because of the end-of-year push. February and October, meanwhile, had the shortest workday lengths (8 hours and 35 minutes), according to the report.And despite the major return-to-office push, the report found a big win for fully remote employees: They are the most productive workers.\"Remote-only workers have the highest daily productivity (+29 mins) vs. other worker types,\" the report notes.Related: What Is 'Task Masking'?
