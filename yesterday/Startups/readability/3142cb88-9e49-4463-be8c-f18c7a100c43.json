Belkin is launching the accessories on the launch day for Nintendo’s newest hybrid game console, and all of the products are officially licensed to work with the Switch 2. If I were Nintendo, I would be happy about Belkin’s entry into this market as it validates the opportunity. The products include a Nintendo Switch 2 Charging Case, which combines protection and power with a built-in 10K battery, keeping your device charged and ready for seamless gaming on the go.  Belkin also has a new Nintendo Travel Case. It blends portability, premium protection, and sleek style for gamers on the go.  The company has also created its TemperedGlass Anti-Reflective Screen Protector for Switch 2. It offers durable, smudge-resistant protection with reduced glare for clearer visibility indoors and out.  A gaming power bank from Belkin. And Belkin has a TemperedGlass Blue Light Screen Protector for Switch 2. This delivers durable, smudge-resistant protection while reducing blue light for greater clarity and eye comfort during long gaming sessions. Logan Olson, director of Future Ventures at Belkin, said in an interview with GamesBeat that his group within Belkin is just a couple of years old. (Belkin itself has been around since 1983). And the company created the group to take it into new markets for accessories such as gaming. Belkin has an anti-reflective protector for the Switch 2. “This segment of Belkin is extremely strategic,” Olson said. “Its purpose is to really expand Belkin into new categories. So new product categories, new completely different business models, as well as new partnerships. Now we’re delivering on the organization’s promise.” Olson said gaming is a natural fit for Belkin as it is known for its charging devices, protection, quality, sustainability and more — and it wants to bring into gaming, he said. (Belkin was in gaming back in the early 2000s with the release of a gaming mouse). “Of course, there’s PC gaming, console gaming, mobile gaming. But what really makes sense with mobile console gaming is Nintendo, which with the Switch One created this category. Nintendo has sold more than 150 million Switch devices since 2017, and now it’s finally launching the Switch 2. “Mobile console gaming is just that natural progression from where we are in the mobile phone space and the demographics of the category,” he said. “Unlike PC gaming and regular console gaming, it’s 50-50 male/female, which is fantastic. It’s unique to this category in gaming. As the Switch grew as a market, it really started to make sense for us.” Belkin Switch 2 accessories. Nintendo also spans the generations, hitting everyone from GenAlpha to Boomers. Belkin targeted pain points — like the risk of having a bigger screen scratched, or running out of batteries on the road. The aim was to provide quality, elevated accessories that people would be proud to show off. “Our intent is to elevate the entire Switch accessory market. We want to set a new standard, a new bar of quality,” Olson said. The Switch 2 power challenge is a big one because it draws more power than a smartphone and is more like an iPad in that respect. The battery life is about the same, but people want to play their games longer these days, Olson said. That’s where the charger adds value. Belkin has also built charging into its case for the Switch 2, so people can charge it inside the bag. It comes in three colors, and it has a net for storage and a place to put game cards. The 10,000 milliamp power bank is integrated into the bag, with 20 watts of fast charging. The Switch 2 has a USB-C charging port, so a number of Belkin charging products will work with it. Belkin’s new charging case lets you charge the Switch 2 while you play. The charger supports tabletop mode, where you can charge while gaming. Belkin noted that 55% of Switch players play in handheld mode. The price is expected to be $70, which is still subject to changes if tariffs take effect. Special firmware in the charger regulates the charging temperature, which can’t get too hot inside a storage case. You can put an Air Tag in the case to make sure you can find it. In terms of the size, it’s like a clutch to carry around. Meanwhile, the travel bag will be about $30.As for screen protection, Belkin has long had products in Apple Stores to protect phone and tablet screens. Now you can get a Switch 2 screen protector ($30 which come in packs of two or four. It makes the screen more scratch resistant and better for the environment as it is made from recycled glass. It’s also anti-reflective, which allows you to play games on the Switch 2 in the outdoors. That makes the device more mobile in direct sunlight. Belkin is also releasing a screen protector that can filter out Blue Light ($25), so people can play at night and not have to worry the light will cause them to stay up longer. Olson said that Belkin reached carbon neutrality this year with its products and is incorporating responsibly sourced materials in its products. “Screen protection so interesting because the amount of engineering and just science that has to go into it is insane. So all the way from the glass material itself and what you choose there, and then down to the glue and what you choose there, and down to what is on screen here the UX — all of that is meticulously engineered, tested, re engineered, retested,” Olson said.",
