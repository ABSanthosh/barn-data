The game is officially out now on PlayStation5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam. Following a successful period in Steam Early Access and Xbox Game Preview, today marks the game’s full 1.0 launch, bringing with it a wave of new content, polish, and performance upgrades. Since its initial early access release, Maximum Football has grown with direct input from its passionate community. Version 1.0 delivers fresh new features and a variety of quality-of-life improvements. The game continues to evolve as a free-to-play experience that puts creative control and customization directly into players’ hands. “Today’s launch is a major milestone for the team and our community,” said Philippe Cohen, CEO of Maximum Entertainment, in a statement. “We’ve built this game together with our players, and now we’re thrilled to welcome the full console and PC experience to our audience.” Brand-new to Maximum Football’s 1.0 launch is the introduction of Season 3: Golden Era, the game’s most creative and ambitious season yet! Inspired by the grit and glory of 1930s–1940s football, this new season delivers a bold visual identity with vintage uniforms, leather helmets, and classic-era gear. Players can unlock two new stadiums—Old Glory Grounds and Victory Park—each offering a distinct throwback atmosphere. As the first Season available on PlayStation 5, Golden Era brings a nostalgic flair to modern gameplay, blending historic aesthetics with today’s cutting-edge mechanics. The Season Pass offers both free and premium content, giving players more ways than ever to stand out on the field. Additionally, Maximum Football will now offer rain and snow, bringing new atmosphere and an additional layer of challenge to the gameplay experience. Stadium customization and the ability to upload up to nine logos per team are more of the features new to 1.0.  All of this is just the beginning. With Franchise Mode scheduled for release later this year and new seasons dropping regularly, Maximum Football features an exciting roadmap full of new challenges, cosmetics, and gameplay enhancements. Maximum Football is now available as a free-to-play download. With more than 300 titles in its catalog, Maximum Entertainment has joined forces with talented creators and renowned franchises around the globe to deliver magic to the gamer in everyone.
