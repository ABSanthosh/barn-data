Paradromics Connexus® Brain-Computer Interface is assembled by a multi-disciplinary team in their Austin facility.

It was safely implanted, collected electrical brain signals, and was removed intact in less than 20 minutes.  “We’ve known for some time, based on our preclinical studies, that we have developed a world-class BCI platform,” Matt Angle, CEO and founder of Paradromics, said in a statement. “Now with the jump to human surgeries and recordings, we are closer to translating this neurotechnology to patients.” The procedure is just the first of many that Paradromics has planned in the coming months. Paradromics Connexus® Brain-Computer Interface records signals from individual neurons just below the surface of the cortical brain using the Connexus Cortical Module. The system supports the use of up to four cortical modules and over 1600+ intracortical electrodes.

The Connexus BCI, implanted during the surgery, is meant to restore communication for patients who are suffering from conditions like ALS, stroke, and spinal cord injury, according to the company. “This work brings us one major step closer to providing treatment to patients with severe unmet medical needs,” biomedical engineer Matthew Willsey said in a statement. The procedure also marks Paradromics’ next phase as a clinical-stage company, although there is likely still a ways to go before the device is available for commercial use, as it has not yet been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration. Although brain-computer interface devices have long been studied, Austin-based Paradromics is hardly the only company pursuing commercial applications of the technology. Elon Musk’s Neuralink is developing chips meant to restore autonomy to those with mobility limitations related to brain or spinal injuries; their broader goal, as Musk has previously stated, is achieving “human/AI symbiosis.” In January 2024, Neuralink successfully implanted its device into the brain of a quadriplegic patient. Although functionality of the device degraded over time as its tendrils slipped out of the brain tissue, the patient has become an enthusiastic proponent of Neuralink, The New York Times reported. The company also secured FDA approval to test the device in more human subjects. Neuralink reported that a second patient with the implant had remarkable success using the device without the electrode slipping that occurred in the first. Another competitor in the space is Synchron, which developed a stent-like brain implant with electrodes that interpret electrical signals. Because Synchron’s device is implanted in a vein, rather than directly into brain tissue, it is considered less invasive than devices like Neuralink’s. Synchron began implanting its device in humans in 2019, and in mid-May partnered up with Apple to work towards enabling people to control their phones with the implant, The Wall Street Journal reported.Top TechWeekly roundup of the latest in tech news",
