  "text": "The number of businesses requiring employees to spend more time in the office continues to grow this year, with companies like Amazon and Dell ordering staff to work in-person all five weekdays. This month Starbucks became the latest corporation to tighten its mandate — and the most recent to get emphatic pushback from workers unhappy about it. What remains to be seen, however, is whether that protest fizzles out quickly, or causes Starbucks the longer-term problems other companies that reinforced stricter in-office rules have encountered.News of staff blowback came just days after Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol extended the company’s previous requirement that corporate staff work in their offices three days per week to four. According to a memo Niccol sent out July 14, the mandate applies to “leaders and people managers” in the chain’s Seattle headquarters, Toronto corporate center, and North American regional offices. It stipulated Monday through Thursday as “common days” of mandatory presence, and said that to comply with the rule, all executives covered by it “will be expected to be based in Seattle or Toronto within 12 months.” Given that obligation for some managers to pull up their residential roots and relocate, buyout packages—reportedly payouts between involving $20,000 to $100,000 — are on offer to executives who’d prefer to leave instead.The decision effectively strips company managers of their existing remote work privileges. It also comes as part of Niccol’s wider “Back to Starbucks” drive to reverse the coffee giant’s declining foot traffic and sales by restoring the coffee chain’s former allure, feel, and service to customers. That effort now includes its corporate offices in addition to its global cafés.“We are reestablishing our in-office culture because we do our best work when we’re together,” Niccol said. “We share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster. Being in person also helps us build and strengthen our culture. As we work to turn the business around, all these things matter more than ever.”Some Starbucks corporate employees clearly don’t agree—especially those who pasted a flyer denouncing Niccol’s decision in an office elevator in Seattle used by the firm’s executives . Over the weekend, a post featuring a photo of the protest poster appeared on social media platform Reddit, decrying Niccol’s tightened return to workplace order, and other austerity-minded decisions he’s imposed since taking over last September.“Getting ‘Back to Starbucks’ isn’t just about comfy chairs,” the flyer said, claiming Niccol’s policies had taken the company farther away from its hallowed past, rather than back to it. “It’s about our Culture, Values, Mission, and how we treat people and the environment. This is the wrong direction. Please stop.”Coming as it did less than six months after Starbucks laid off 1,100 people in February, Niccol’s tightened mandate and buyout offer sparked speculation about its true objective. As happened when Dell, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and other corporations similarly tightened in-person requirements, some observers suspected one goal was to lower headcount through voluntary departures.“I heard this is more of a way to reduce costs,” said redditor EntranceHorror7856 on a subreddit dedicated to Starbucks and its employees. To back its theory up, the post referred to a recently revealed Starbucks incentive to pay company executives up to $6 million in stock bonuses if they help achieve cost cutting targets.“They are trying to get people to quit without another layoff,” the post continued. “What pisses me off is that they are going after the little guys instead of cutting their executives bonuses.”“This seems to be the corporate trend in the U.S. these days,” agreed contributor Raider_Jokey_Smurf.Starbucks has denied those suspicions, replying in media reports that its tighter mandate is entirely about enhancing company culture and performance. Still, one of those results apparently doesn’t preclude the other.As an example of that, Starbucks program management leader Kristina Lawson said in a LinkedIn post she is “considering alternative options because I was hired into my current role as a fully remote partner and am being asked to uproot my life to move to Seattle.” She listed her professional qualifications for prospective employers to consider as part of that.“Some of us having extenuating circumstances that don’t make a move like this a complete given,” Lawson added.Why is her reaction significant? Because if the provocative elevator poster—which Business Insider says turned up in other spots around Starbucks’ Seattle offices in recent days — is embarrassing, it’s not a threat to business.Lawson’s reaction, by contrast, could be — especially if other managers do the same. That’s a real risk for companies tightening in-person work rules, many of which have experienced increased turnover after these mandates were issued.Additionally, several studies have shown that many large companies that cracked the in-office whip on returning to the cubicle eventually experienced voluntary departures of their most experienced, talented, and diverse employees as a result. The reason? Those savvy, skilled, hard-to-find staffers know they can find similar work under more flexible conditions elsewhere far easier than less senior colleagues, who may feel compelled to ride out return to office strictures.But even the resignation rate of that latter group may be set to change soon. A recent Pew Research survey found nearly half of people questioned said they would quit their job if their remote or hybrid work arrangements were eliminated — a threat voiced most frequently by younger people. Those evolved views have led some observers declare that workplace flexibility is no longer an option, but an employee expectation.All of that may be offer companies cause to carefully contemplate both the potential losses in addition to gains that may result from tightening in-person office requirements. Because even though it’s recently become vogue for business leaders like Mark Cuban, Reed Hoffman, and Skimms co-founder Emma Grede to scoff at very notion of work-life balance in business, millions of employees now consider it a valid and important priority — and one worth preserving.As a result, when faced with reinforced in-office rules, many more workers than ever before may be ready to defend their work-life balance by voting with their feet, and leaving in search of employers ready to provide the desired flexibility to make it possible.The final deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is this Friday, July 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
