  "text": "A Virginia-based startup is tackling the overwhelming textile waste problem—and investing about $500 million in a first-of-its-kind recycling plant in France.The company’s trick is separating cotton and polyester fibers, which is a mechanically difficult process. Previous methodologies for clothing recycling would usually result in destruction of either the polyester or the cotton. But Danville, Virginia-based Circ has devised a method for recovering both polyester and cotton fibers from clothing waste into separate recycling streams, using what Circ COO Conor Hartman describes as a “fancy pressure cooker for textiles.” The device is calibrated to break down the polyester, while also preserving the cotton. The fibers are then purified for reuse. “These are drop-in replacements for how the industry works today,” he says.Circ’s recycling facility will be located in Saint-Avold, France, with construction slated to begin in 2026. It is expected to process more than 77,000 tons of polycotton-blend fabric per year when it gets up and running, likely by 2028, and create as many as 200 direct and indirect jobs. Funding is expected to be a blend of equity and debt, and Hartman says Circ is in active talks with investors to secure that funding.Photo: Courtesy companyBefore ultimately landing on Saint-Avold, Circ assessed 80 industrial sites, including some in North America. Their decision-making process came down to a number of factors, including the energy mix of the local grid, policies for climate technology companies, logistic capabilities of the site, as well as access to an appropriately skilled workforce.“France has been investing in green industry and carbon responsible industrial businesses and has created a very hospitable environment for that,” Hartman says. “The French government also, in attracting businesses like ours to the country, put together a competitive package that was compelling on top of all those very important fundamentals.”The Trump administration’s pullback from climate-friendly legislation and incentives for cleantech companies has introduced considerable uncertainty in the industry. But Hartman says Circ is planning for the long term and that U.S. policy wasn’t a huge factor in their decision making.“We face textile challenges in the United States. They’re faced in Europe. They’re faced in every country where people wear clothes,” Hartman says. “Our scope and our plans extend globally in terms of where we will put facilities, so certainly we look forward to having one in the United States as well.”Textile waste is a major problem. As Inc. previously reported, only about 15 percent of waste clothing in the U.S. is collected to be reused or recycled, and the average person in the U.S. tosses around 100 pounds of textile annually. A report published in 2021 the journal Materials Circular Economy found that 92 million tons of textile waste is produced globally each year, with that quantity expected to rise to 134 million tons by 2030. The problem isn’t just about clothing waste: The textile value chain accounts for roughly 2 to 8 percent of annual greenhouse gas emissions, according to a 2023 report from the United Nations Environment Programme.Photo: Courtesy companyA number of companies and organizations are looking to solve this problem, from nonprofits like Goodwill to more innovative companies like New York City-based SuperCircle, which aims to unlock recycling or downcycling at scale. And, of course, Circ. Hartman says he’s encouraged by the innovation he’s seeing in the industry, as there is “so much room,” or in other words, waste enough for numerous players to tackle.“We’re on the front end of change. And I’d say if we look at the market today as compared to five years ago, the momentum is continuing to build positively,” he says.Much of the industry’s success, however, relies on buy-in and commitments from major clothing brands.The super early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
