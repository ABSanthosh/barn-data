  "text": "After a decade running the Los Angeles-based venture capital fund Backstage Capital, founder Arlan Hamilton is taking on a chairperson and advisory role – a decision that she tells Inc. has been “in the works for a while.” The fund, meanwhile, will be undergoing its own evolution.   Hamilton founded Backstage Capital in 2015 — and built the fund up while experiencing homelessness — with a commitment to supporting startups led by women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ founders across industries. Since then, the fund has raised approximately $30 million “between deployable capital and operations,” Hamilton confirmed to Inc. Its mission remains alive today, Hamilton says, adding that she’s “poured everything into” it since its founding. But she’s been thinking about her role at the fund since 2022, and started planning the transition “in earnest” earlier this year, saying she believes she’s taken the fund “as far as I think I can take it.” The results of the presidential election solidified her need for help, Hamilton notes, as well as “fresh leadership” to carry the fund forward.  A new partnership for a new era On Friday, Hamilton announced via social media that the fund would be entering a strategic partnership with 360 Venture Collective, a Miami, Florida-based venture firm focused on companies “led by historically underestimated founders building in the fin-tech, health-tech, prop-tech, and future of work sectors,” per its website. Through this partnership, Hamilton announced, 360 Venture Collective “will be acquiring a significant stake in Backstage’s management entity” and will “co-manage operations, provide capital, and help us scale.” Additionally, the two will be “launching a $200M fund in 2025,” Hamilton said in her announcement.   Hamilton says the fund is in good hands with 360 Venture Collective’s managing partner Kelly O’Connell, though she declined to comment on what O’Connell’s exact role at Backstage will be. “She knows exactly where we want to go. She’s extremely strategic,” Hamilton says. “She and her team came in with ideas and came in with connections and came in with a fire in their belly that I think is going to be really special.”   It’s no secret that Backstage has endured challenges in recent years – and Hamilton herself has spoken about them publicly. In 2022, she shared on her podcast that the team had downsized from a headcount of 12 to three. The team remains at three today, she says, including herself.   “We have limited funds, and a lot of the funding that went to pay for the last two years came from my pocket,” Hamilton says. She adds that the fund has “been near shut down multiple times,” but believes that this new chapter will give the fund the “wings” it needs.   In addition to the strategic partnership with 360 Venture Collective, Hamilton stated in her announcement that Backstage would be “stepping away from the traditional micro fund approach and leaning into conviction-based investments.” That means the fund will “make fewer investments than the 200 that we’ve made in 10 years, and the goal is that they’ll be higher amounts per deal,” she says.   In this new era, will Backstage Capital stay focused on those women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ founders? Hamilton says, “Of course.” Though, in the current landscape of anti-DEI attacks, Hamilton says that she knows their approach could lead to a lawsuit or shutdown attempt.   “I understand that, and I want what’s best for Backstage, but we’re not going to change our colors because someone else doesn’t want to see them,” she says. “In 2013, I set out to raise funds and other resources for underrepresented and now underestimated founders, and that’s what we do.”  Next steps for Arlan Hamilton In her advisory role at Backstage, Hamilton plans to continue to bring opportunities to the table for the fund, she says, be they new companies or investors – and says she will continue to “work on this mission till the day I die.”   “I encourage others to look at what they’re really great at…what drives them, what they should be doing for themselves, rather than what other people say they should be doing,” Hamilton says. “Because it’s really freeing, and it also will probably help the other people in your life and in your orbit.”",
