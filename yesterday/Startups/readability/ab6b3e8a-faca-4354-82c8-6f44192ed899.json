  "text": "When customers buy software, they aren’t just buying a product—they’re buy an experience. It sounds simple, yet so many leaders double down on what their technology can do and fail to consider how their solution makes customers feel. That’s why the most successful companies understand that delivering a seamless, intuitive, and valuable user journey is just as important as the functionality of their product. Your competitors can copy your features, but they can’t replicate the emotional connection of a thoughtfully crafted experience. Industries across the board, from finance to healthcare and e-commerce, should redefine how they engage customers by focusing on holistic experiences rather than standalone solutions.  The experience-first mindset Companies that dominate their industries understand that customers expect technology to anticipate their needs, whether it’s Hulu knowing exactly what content to recommend, Shopify making online selling frictionless for businesses, or Apple Pay making one-click purchases effortless. These expectations extend to sectors like healthcare, finance, and B2B software, where users demand platforms that integrate seamlessly into their workflows, improve efficiency, and enhance overall outcomes. For example, financial services companies like Square and Stripe have transformed digital transactions by prioritizing user experience. Their success stems from making complex financial operations simple, intuitive, and accessible. Similarly in e-commerce, Shopify has built a thriving ecosystem by ensuring that its software offers small businesses an experience that supports growth, from easy integrations to automated marketing tools. The same philosophy applies to healthcare. Companies that provide telehealth platforms are not just offering virtual consultations; they are building end-to-end digital healthcare experiences that integrate with patient records, insurance verification, and appointment scheduling. In industries where customer trust and satisfaction are critical, businesses that optimize these experiences gain a significant competitive advantage. The intersection of experience and impact Ensuring that new products and features support the customer experience starts with one core principle: Customer needs must drive innovation. Companies that prioritize customer experience in their product roadmap ask four critical questions before development even begins:  How will this feature make users’ jobs easier?  Does it remove friction in their daily workflow?  Will it integrate smoothly with the tools they already use?  Does it contribute to a more intuitive, seamless experience?  Too often, companies fall into the trap of adding features simply because they seem trendy and exciting, rather than because they solve a real problem. This is where applying the jobs-to-be-done framework, a concept I often reference, becomes invaluable.  Instead of focusing on what a product or technology is, companies should focus on what the customer is hiring it to do. In the case of cloud-based practice management software, businesses aren’t just looking for software; they are looking for a system that allows them to standardize workflows, streamline communication, and drive operational efficiency. Building a strong experience isn’t just about usability, but also about creating meaningful impact. Across industries, successful SaaS companies offer solutions that centralize data, automate repetitive tasks, and provide actionable insights that improve decision-making and efficiency. For example, Slack is more than a messaging platform; it’s an integrated workspace designed to improve team collaboration and productivity. Similarly, Zoom digitized video calls but, more importantly, transformed how businesses communicate by offering frictionless, high-quality virtual meetings. In each case, these companies didn’t just sell software. They built experiences that fundamentally changed how people work. By focusing on why customers use a product, not just what it does, companies can create solutions that deliver lasting impressions and experiences. Lessons from industry leaders We’ve seen firsthand that companies that embrace an experience-first mentality have strong industry leadership and build stronger customer loyalty. The most successful SaaS companies in any industry are those that: 1. Prioritize simplicity and usability. Customers shouldn’t need extensive training to navigate software. The best platforms are intuitive from the start.  2. Offer deep integration capabilities. Today’s businesses use multiple tools, and they expect them to work together. The most successful SaaS companies create connected experiences through integrations and open APIs. 3. Use AI and automation thoughtfully. AI is more than a trend or buzzword. It’s a way to create smarter, more efficient workflows that empower users. The best SaaS companies leverage AI to reduce complexity, automate repetitive tasks, and surface real-time insights. 4. Think beyond the transaction. Customers want more than a good product; they want a trusted partner. Companies that invest in education, onboarding, and continuous innovation build lasting relationships. Shaping the future of customer experience The companies that will lead the next decade of innovation aren’t just those with the best technology. They are the ones that understand how their technology fits into their customers’ daily lives. Whether in healthcare, finance, retail, or workplace collaboration, the shift from selling software to delivering holistic experiences is already underway. Those who fail to recognize it risk being left behind. As technology continues to evolve, will your company be remembered for what it built, or for how it transformed the lives of those who used it? The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, May 2, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
