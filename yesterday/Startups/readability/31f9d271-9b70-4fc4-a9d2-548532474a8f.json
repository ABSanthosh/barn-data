The title launches into early access on December 11 with ranked and unranked play. Ballistic is intended to be an adrenaline-filled, round-based 5v5 competitive game mode where strategy, tactical teamwork, and individual prowess are essential for victory. Ballistic is launching with the Skyline 10 map, a starting set of weapons, and a limited number of items. Adjustments will be made beyond launch based on player feedback, in addition to major updates such as new maps, weapons, and features. The part of the Ballistic early access map. All saved presets from your Locker will carry over into Ballistic, which supports existing Fortnite Outfits, Back Blings, Kicks, Wraps, Sprays, and Emotes. Pickaxes, Contrails, Instruments, Vehicles, and Jam Tracks are not used/supported. At launch, Ballistic will be available on all platforms and regions where Fortnite is supported, with the exceptions of South Korea and Russia. Epic Games is working to make Ballistic available in both regions and will provide an update when we have news to share. Round by round Ballistic will debut in early access with the Skyline 10 map. In Ballistic, players are sorted into two teams at the start of the match: attackers and defenders. Attackers aim to plant a reality-tearing Rift Point Device at one of two sites on the map, while defenders do their best to thwart the device from being planted and detonated. There are no respawns in Ballistic — a round is over if the Rift Point Device explodes, or either team is fully eliminated. After six rounds, players will swap sides, giving defenders a chance to be attackers and vice versa. The game is over when either team has won seven rounds total. Ballistic is launching in early access with the Skyline 10 map, with more maps to come in the future. Going Ballistic A flash bang grenade in Ballistic. On the buy screen, you’ll select your weapons loadout for each round. You’ll start the game with a Ranger Pistol and 800 Credits. In Ballistic, Credits can be earned from scoring eliminations and planting the Rift Point Device, and spent within a match at the beginning of every round on additional items and weapons to bolster your chances of success. Survive a round and you’ll keep all of your gear and shields for the next one, minus any consumable items you’ve used. You can drop weapons, smoke grenades, and flashbangs at any time for your teammates, and pick them up from eliminated players. The Rift Point Device takes 45 seconds to detonate after it’s planted. If it’s successfully defended, you’ll want to move a fair distance away or run the risk of being eliminated in the device’s blast radius. Getting eliminated by the blast means losing any gear you may have. You can check the scoreboard at any time during a Ballistic match to see how you and your teammates are doing, and to know what weapons and items your teammates are working with.
