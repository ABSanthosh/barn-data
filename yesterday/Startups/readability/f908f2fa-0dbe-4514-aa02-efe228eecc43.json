For example, the shape of termite mounds generates convection, which cools the mound by pulling in fresh air from the surface. Now, two Malaysian engineering students from the Asia Pacific University of Technology and Innovation have developed a passive cooling system based on controlled airflow and evaporative cooling, similar to that used by termite mounds and traditional Middle Eastern architecture. Brikoole features a brick structure with strategically placed ventilation holes that allow air to enter. The air passes through an intricate internal structure, currently a 3D-printed honeycomb pattern made from natural wood filament. This mesh is kept moist using an integrated water distribution system. As air is drawn through the humid environment, evaporation provides a cooling effect. The cooled air is then channelled into the building’s interior. By harnessing the natural cooling effect of evaporation, Brikoole can lower indoor temperatures by up to six degrees Celsius on average, significantly reducing the need for energy-intensive cooling technologies. And, unlike traditional passive cooling systems, the Brikoole is modular, scalable, and does not require significant architectural modifications. This allows Brikoole to be easily incorporated into different building designs and styles. Brikoole Co-founder Wayne Chong Chee Kin described the systems’ potential effects on countering global warming to Springwise: “By creating a comfortable temperature and humidity level, Brikoole reduces the need for air conditioners. Lower air conditioner usage translates to decreased household carbon footprints, a crucial step in fighting global warming. Reducing carbon footprints directly impacts the rate of global warming, helping to mitigate its effects over time.” The Brikoole system is a James Dyson National winner for 2024 and its designers are interested in eventually partnering with construction companies to implement the technology. Meanwhile, the team plans to develop a 3D-printed terracotta internal structure and is committed to conducting comprehensive real-world testing. They are also exploring design variations catered to specific building types and regional climate challenges.
