  "text": "Netmarble revealed its upcoming RPG, The Seven Deadly Sins: Origins, over the weekend. The new game is a new open-world action-adventure game, set in the same world as the anime and manga universe, The Seven Deadly Sins. According to the studio, the game doesn’t currently have a release date, but it’s launching worldwide on PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and mobile. The game is currently available for wishlisting on Steam and PlayStation, with pre-registration on Google Play and the App Store at a later date. The Seven Deadly Sins: Origins features major characters and familiar locations from the manga and anime, though the multiverse story will be original to the game. Players travel the continent of Britannia as a new protagonist, collecting characters to add to their battle teams. The game is built in Unreal Engine 5, with intricate detailing to the environments and characters amidst dynamic combat scenes. Netmarble dropped trailers for the game at Summer Game Fest showcase and the Future Games Show. The company has launched several games set in the Seven Deadly Sins universe, including The Seven Deadly Sins: Grand Cross in 2019 and The Seven Deadly Sins: IDLE Adventure in 2024, both on mobile. The company has also launched Game of Thrones: Kingsroad and Solo Leveling: Arise in 2024, both adaptations of popular IP.",
