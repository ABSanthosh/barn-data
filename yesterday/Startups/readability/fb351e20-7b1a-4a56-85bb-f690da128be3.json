  "text": "Just one month after Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced he was taking a break from politics to focus on his businesses, he retook center stage in Washington, going on the attack once again this week over Trump’s budget bill that was signed into law Friday. Trump countered with a threat to pull the government contracts held by Musk’s companies and even hinted at deporting the world’s richest man from the U.S. This time, though, the stakes could be a lot higher than the pride of the billionaires. The fight this week between Musk and Donald Trump underlined the still-simmering tension between Trump and his former “First Buddy“—and could set the stage for a much larger showdown in 2026 and, perhaps, 2028.After calling the legislation a “disgusting abomination” on social media in early June (and making several accusations against Trump personally), Musk waded back into political waters Monday, calling the bill “utterly insane and destructive” and vowing to unseat Congressional leaders who voted in favor of the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” which will raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion. “Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head in shame!” Musk wrote. “And they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.”Things, of course, escalated quickly. Musk took things to the next level later, saying if the bill passes, he would launch a third political party immediately. “If this insane spending bill passes, the America Party will be formed the next day,” he wrote on social media.Trump threatened to end government contracts to Musk’s businesses and when asked if he would deport Musk, he said “I don’t know. We’ll have to take a look.”Following Trump’s threats, Musk bit his tongue, writing on X, “So tempting to escalate this. So, so tempting. But I will refrain for now.”The two continued to growl at each other over social media throughout the day and into early Wednesday morning, but without the teeth they bared earlier in the day.Friday, as the nation celebrated the Fourth of July, Musk refrained from any further direct attack on Trump, but continued to signal boost the possibility of the American Party, as well as retweeting posts that were opposed to the budget bill. He also launched a new poll asking whether “we should create the American Party,” which got over 750,000 votes, with roughly two-thirds of his followers voting yes.The latest dust up between Musk and Trump came less than two weeks after Musk told YCombinator’s AI Startup School that he had been frustrated by the political process.“Fixing the government is kind of like the beach is dirty and there’s some needles and feces and like trash and you want to clean up the beach,” he said. “But then there’s also this thousand-foot wall of water which is a tsunami of AI. And how much does cleaning the beach really matter if you’ve got a thousand-foot tsunami about to hit? Not that much. … It’s just so much noise. The signal to noise ratio in politics is terrible.”Musk isn’t above making noise himself. His threats of launching a third political party have to be taken somewhat seriously, given his wealth and his willingness to spend it on political affairs. Last year, Musk poured $288 million into the election, helping Trump and his allies get elected.Musk’s personal sway isn’t what it used to be, though. His popularity has plunged after his work with DOGE and his mercurial temper has been on display in his arguments with Trump and members of the Cabinet. His efforts to elect a Wisconsin Supreme Court judge in April fell short, raising questions about his political impact. Investors in Tesla aren’t happy with Musk’s political spats, either. Shares have fallen nearly 8.5 percent since June 3.A 2024 Gallup poll saw support for a third political party in the U.S. fall five percentage points from the year prior to 58 percent. But despite that slim majority saying they were in favor of another option, no third party has ever managed to gain traction with voters in a major election—and Musk’s divisive personality could make him ill-suited to be the face of such a party.The real test of Musk’s remaining political capital could come next year. He has already indicated he will support Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Kentucky), who opposed the budget bill and who Trump has threatened to unseat. That’s likely when the war of words between Trump and Musk will truly spill over into the real world—unless they find something bigger to battle over before then. The final deadline for the 2025 Inc.
