  "text": "Since 2020, DEI–diversity, equity, and inclusion–has gained momentum across workplaces, academic halls, and social media platforms. Some of the movement’s leaders–including Ibram X. Kendi, author of How to Be an Antiracist, and Robin DiAngelo, author of White Fragility–have focused on the idea that racism is everywhere, and fundamentally embedded into White culture in particular. A new study questions whether, when incorporated into DEI trainings, this type of “anti-racist” mindset makes things better or worse. Researchers at Rutger’s Social Perception Lab, along with the Network Contagion Research Institute, a nonprofit that studies the “spread of hostile ideological content,” set up a study to see what, if any impact, writings by Kendi and DiAngelo had on people’s perception of racism.What the study looked atResearchers looked to answer the following question: Do ideas and rhetoric foundational to many DEI trainings foster pluralistic inclusiveness, or do they exacerbate intergroup and interpersonal conflicts? Do they increase empathy and understanding or increase hostility towards members of groups labeled as oppressors? They randomly assigned 423 undergraduate student volunteers from Rutgers to a control group or a test group. The control group read a passage about corn, while the test group read a passage where researchers combined quotes from Kendi and DiAngelo’s published works. Here are samples of both, and you can read the full passages on page 21 of the study:Ibram X. Kendi/Robin DiAngelo Excerpt: “White people raised in Western society are conditioned into a white supremacist worldview. Racism is the norm; it is not unusual. As a result, interaction with White people is at times so overwhelming, draining, and incomprehensible that it causes serious anguish for People of Color. Furthermore, racism is essentially capitalist; capitalism is essentially racist. To love capitalism is to love racism.”Control Text: “America has just about 90 million planted acres of corn, and there’s a reason people refer to the crop as yellow gold. In 2021, U.S. corn was worth over $86 billion, based on calculations from FarmDoc and the United States Department of Agriculture. According to the USDA, the U.S. is the largest consumer, producer, and exporter of corn in the world.”Participants were then asked to evaluate different situations where there was absolutely no indication of race or racism. One of these situations read as follows: A student applied to an elite East Coast university in Fall 2024. During the application process, he was interviewed by an admissions officer. Ultimately, the student’s application was rejected. That was the situation–no details about the race of the applicant or the admissions officer. Just that someone applied, was interviewed, and was rejected. The results show something frightening.Finding racism where no racism existsBecause there are no other details, it’s impossible to know why the admissions officer rejected the applicant. But study participants who had been primed with readings from Kendi and DiAngelo were more likely to develop a “hostile attribution bias”: They “perceived the admissions officer as significantly more prejudiced than those who read the neutral corn essay.”Specifically, these participants were more likely to believe that: The admissions officer was unfair to the applicant (~12%), Caused more harm to the applicant (~26%) Had committed more of microaggressions (~35%) These results were so strong that the researchers recruited another 1,086 students through Amazon Prime Panels and ran the study again. They received statistically similar results.With no indication of race, and no reason given as to why an admissions officer rejected the candidate, people should have remained neutral on why the admissions officer rejected the candidate. That’s the admission’s officer’s job–not everyone who applies will be admitted.What this means for your businessOf course, the DiAngelo/Kendi form of DEI is not the only way companies teach and promote diversity. And the passages used in this study were designed to be inflammatory, combining sentences from a variety of DiAngelo and Kendi’s texts. But this isn’t the first study to show that DEI training can cause more problems than it fixes.Studies going back to 1995 have shown that diversity training had “no positive effects in the workplace.” Some studies also indicated a negative impact on company diversity when training emphasized the threat of lawsuits or was mandatory for all employees.This Rutgers study focused on a specific type of training that made things worse. You don’t want employees seeing racism around every corner and jumping to conclusions.Take a look at your DEI programs. Are they priming people to see discrimination where no discrimination exists?Instead, focus on training that teaches people how to act, not that speculates on why people act the way they do. Your focus in the workplace should be behavior based: Civil Rights laws, such as Title VII prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, gender, and other protected characteristics. Your company’s job is to prohibit discrimination, not to find problems behind every conversation.DEI on the way outEven prior to this study, the prevalence of DEI-based training has been dropping off. Big companies such as John Deere, Walmart, and Ford Motors have all rolled back some of their DEI programs in the past year or so.Don’t confuse DEI with diversity, though. DEI has become a general shorthand for the Kendi/DiAngelo style of training. Working to make sure everyone in your office feels comfortable and that you hire the best person for the job regardless of protected characteristics should remain a top priority.But, consider whether focusing on the idea that there are oppressors and oppressed is really the best way to make things better.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",
