  "text": "A futuristic solar-powered vehicle made by a startup called Aptera just took a long road trip, powered by the sun. And one of Aptera’s executives was at the wheel. Steve Fambro, Aptera’s co-founder and co-CEO, took a more than 300-mile trip in the company’s signature solar-powered three-wheeled EV. He drove the sleek vehicle from Flagstaff, Arizona all the way to Imperial Valley, California on a single charge, thanks to solar panels installed in its roof, hood, and hatch.“I’ve been dreaming of this moment for over 20 years, driving in the most efficient vehicle on the road, watching the sights go by. I got emotional just taking it all in,” Fambro said in a video, posted to YouTube, of the drive. “This company, this idea—it’s real, it’s visceral.”Although the road trip was not a formal range test, Carlsbad, California-based Aptera says its vehicle achieved an impressive level of efficiency, despite the fact that the test vehicle was heavier than the production vehicle is meant to be, meaning it could eventually be even more efficient. Although the vehicle is designed to charge from the grid, like most other EVs, it also collects energy from the sun. During the trip, the vehicle added 2.4 kWh of solar energy, which is equivalent to about 20 miles worth of driving, despite the fact that it was a partly cloudy day in the spring. The company claims the vehicle can gather up to 40 miles worth of range from solar energy in optimal conditions.Fambro said he was inspired to start the company after watching the 2004 SpaceShipOne launch. The spaceship was the first privately developed, crewed craft to ever reach the edge of space. He originally co-founded the company in 2006. “I realized [if] a small team could get a rocket into space, a small dedicated team could build a vehicle here on Earth, too,” he said during the video.Aptera was ahead of its time. The company emerged with an efficient vision of mobility two years before Tesla began selling its Roadster. But Aptera shuttered five years later, after struggling to gain government and investor support, The Verge reported. (Fambro says he and current co-CEO Chris Anthony had already left to pursue other projects around 2009.) But in 2019, the company re-emerged with its original leadership, but significantly improved technology, and since then has raised some $140 million through a variety of means. A company spokesperson confirmed that crowdfunding accounts for about $130 million of that overall funding.“We’re just really lucky to have the support of all of our fans and investors. They made us who we are,” Fambro tells Inc. “To be able to take the vehicle out that they paid for, that they supported and demonstrate it on a long road trip with no problems, I think it’s a real confidence booster for everyone.”Fambro says Aptera still needs about $60 million more in funding to kickstart low-volume production of the vehicle, which he says could begin roughly nine months after that funding is secured. Of course, the company is working to secure other revenue streams. In February, Aptera announced a partnership to offer customers the option to outfit Telo’s tiny electric pickup trucks with Aptera solar panels. And in September, Aptera partnered with Polydrops on a solar-powered trailer. Fambro teased other “deals that are still confidential, pilot projects or feasibility studies with other OEMs and other companies where we’re demonstrating our technology on a real life experience with their product.”Fambro’s ultimate goal for Aptera is to amp up EV adoption by removing the friction inherent to charging altogether.“To make solar mobility really real–it’s not a curiosity, it’s not a gimmick—it basically has the potential of meaning that most people won’t have to charge,” he tells Inc. “Most people drive 30 miles a day, so if you’re getting that charge just from being parked, most people probably aren’t going to have to plug it in.”During the road trip, Fambro reflected on Aptera’s history.“The road hasn’t been easy. It’s been painful, difficult and it’s brought me to my breaking point sometimes,” he said. “But being in this moment right now, I can say it’s all been worth it.”The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
