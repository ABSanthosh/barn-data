  "text": "On Wednesday, Amazon held an event in New York City, introducing a long-expected new version of Alexa called Alexa Plus. The new version is powered by generative AI because, well, everything is generative AI now. In Alexa’s case, that means the new voice assistant will be capable of much more natural conversations instead of requiring specific commands for various “skills.”During the demo, the company showed off familiar features. For example, using the Alexa app on your smartphone you’ll be able to take photos and have it analyze images. You’ll also be able to do things like book an Uber or make reservations. At one point, Panos Panay, Amazon’s VP of devices, asked whether the dog had been walked recently, and Alexa used data from smart home cameras to confirm that it had.“While the vision of Alexa has been ambitious and remains incredibly compelling, until right this moment — right this moment — we have been limited by the technology,” Panay said. “An AI chatbot on its own doesn’t get us to our vision of Alexa.”A lot of what Amazon rolled out is similar to the promises made by other tech companies trying to ship the AI assistant that can actually do stuff for us. Though it is obviously late to the game, Amazon is arguably in a much different position, if for no other reason than the fact that people have been asking Alexa questions for a long time. People are used to shouting questions at various devices like smart speakers. None of the other competitors have nearly the advantage in terms of devices you can use to access their chatbot, aside from Apple and Google.As for Apple, when it introduced Apple Intelligence last summer, the killer feature wasn’t the ability to create AI-generated emojis or writing tools. No, the killer feature was the ability to just talk to Siri and have it understand what you want based on context and your personal information.It’s a thing only Apple could really do because it makes the device you’re already using. That means it could theoretically work with any of the apps on your device, as well as all of your personal information.It hasn’t really worked out that way, at least not yet. Apple still hasn’t rolled out App intents, which would make it possible, and even when it does, it’s not entirely clear how many developers will be excited to expose their apps to Apple Intelligence.Amazon, on the other hand, announced partnerships with Uber Eats, Sonos, Zoom, Xbox, Plex, Grubhub, and Ticketmaster, among others. Also, it’s Amazon, which means you get access to the world’s largest e-commerce website, along with Whole Foods, Amazon Prime Video, and Amazon Prime Music. All of those make the service a lot more compelling since there’s a good chance you’re already using a bunch of them.Amazon says Alexa Plus will be available later this spring as a subscription and will work on most of its devices. The price thing is kinda weird, by the way. If you don’t have a Prime Membership, Alexa Plus is $19.99, or $5.00 more than what it costs to get all of the benefits of Prime. I’m not sure who would do that. I also don’t understand who has an Alexa-capable device but isn’t also a Prime member. That Venn diagram feels like just one circle tucked inside another.I still think Apple has the biggest opportunity in terms of creating an assistant that can do useful tasks on your behalf because all of your personal information is already on your iPhone. It’s just not clear when the company will finally ship all of what it promised nine months ago. In the meantime, Amazon just put the iPhone maker on notice.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The application deadline for Inc.'s Best Workplaces Awards is Friday, March 7, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
