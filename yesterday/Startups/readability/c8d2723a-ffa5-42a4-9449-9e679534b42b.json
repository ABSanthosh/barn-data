In addition to affecting employment opportunities, this ‘digital divide’ can isolate people, negatively affect mental health, and lead to educational barriers as post-secondary education increasingly moves online. ReCognition Circular is working to bridge the digital divide by collaborating with local governments in England to provide skills and training around IT equipment repair and refurbishment to those who are digitally disadvantaged. Suitable for complete beginners, the organisation’s educational programme includes a toolkit, 60 hours of instruction, and a broken laptop or device, which participants will learn to repair over the course of the training and can keep afterwards. After completing the training programme, participants will have the basic digital skills they need for everyday tasks like applying for jobs and opening bank accounts, as well as expertise in diagnosing and repairing common tech faults. In addition to helping individuals gain valuable skills, ReCognition Circular’s programme reduces e-waste by recycling IT technology. This supports a circular economy where computers are recycled to help individuals overcome digital and employment barriers, at the same time reducing the energy and resources used to produce new equipment. The organisation is supported through donations and partnerships. Individual and business supporters can donate unwanted computing equipment, lease computers refurbished by ReCognition Circular’s students, volunteer to help students, or contribute money. It costs around £950 to fully fund a learner through the organisation’s training workshop.
