Since launching, a few months ago, we're live with large enterprises across the US, Europe, and APAC and growing at double digits per month. We are backed by world-class investors including Y Combinator, Tribe Capital, PayPal, Picus Capital \u0026 Hashed. Pranay (CEO) and Ram (CTO) are the founders. We have combined experience of 20+ years of building fintech, and tech products for businesses \u0026 customers across the world at companies such as Deutsche Bank, Cloud Kitchens, PayPal, TransferWise, and Amazon, among others. We are looking for an AI/ML engineer who will help shape the tech, product, and culture of the company. We are currently working with a bunch of enterprise customers and banks and are experiencing rapid growth. We are looking to hire very senior engineers who can take our V1 into a more scaleable, robust platform as we prepare for more growth. What to expect You can expect to do all of the following: Build pipelines to clean and transform data for RAG Evaluate multiple models for text classification, sentiment analysis, STT, etc. Run evals Clean, prune, and collect datasets to analyze model performance, hallucination rates, recall, etc. Research and implement SOTA approaches for knowledge graphs and Graph RAGs Implement inference time reasoning approaches to improve the accuracy of models Our values Continuous 360 feedback: Everyone is expected to share constructive critical feedback with everyone else, including the founders. Product-minded: Everyone shares product ownership, so we expect everyone to do customer outreach, support, and talk to customers for feedback and new features. Doers over talkers: We spend time figuring out the right direction to take and then execute very fast. No one is too “senior” to do a job - the CTO will code every day, the CEO will sell every day and everyone takes care of customer support on a schedule. We understand the difference between real work and pretense. Humanity over everything else: We sell the product to businesses, but in reality, we sell it to real humans on the other side. Our end customers are consumers using the product through our UI or integrated with our APIs, so we are building the world’s most human-centric company (no pun intended). Kindness is expected and empathy is the core value we’re looking for. About you We expect you to have built things from 0 to 1 or 1 to 10. Experience with AI/ML and LLMs is mandatory. We don’t read much into your CV, but rather see what you have done in your life so far (side projects, open-source contributions, blogs, etc.). We don’t care about degrees, the institutions you went to, or the companies you worked for before. We are open to talking as long as you have put in the reps, good judgment and clarity, align with our values, and have a strong track record of thoughtful work. We expect you to have worked with early-stage companies before (0 to 1 or 1 to 10), have an extremely strong bias for action, and have built and/or scaled systems from scratch. Pay and benefits We offer a solid, competitive package (including early-stage equity). We give you the flexibility to choose the split between cash and equity. Why you should not join If you want to coast along and do the minimal possible work. The work hours will be intense, we regularly work one of the weekend days as well. It takes a lot of sweat to get a startup off the ground and you will let the team down if you don’t pull up the socks. If you cannot do intense work every day (with exceptions of course). The above point talks about the sheer quantity of the work, but this one is more on the quality. We have intentionally kept meetings to a bare minimum, so people can get into their zones and be productive. But if this gets you distracted and you commit half-assed things, then we might not be the right fit for you. If you are not easy-going with the team. We have hired a team of people who are friendly and help each other out. There is zero attitude in the team. We sometimes have conflicting opinions on how things should be done, but at the end of the day we disagree and still commit to doing the things that move the company forward. If you cannot be with us in our office in Gurgaon at least 3 days a week.",
