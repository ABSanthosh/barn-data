  "text": "U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) broke the record for the longest filibuster on the Senate Floor. His goal, according to political analyst Ed Kilgore, was to “dramatize the scope and intensity of the threat that Trump, Elon Musk, and other presidential stooges pose to government as we know it and to democracy itself.”  If that was the goal, the media conversation would have been about the content of the speech, not on the filibuster record. But the focus of the headlines and reporting wasn’t about the policies that Booker advocated for or the solutions he proposed. It was about the record-breaking speech, which overshadowed its purpose. For leaders of all kinds, it’s a cautionary tale: Are your actions driving meaningful change, or are they just grabbing attention? A reminder for leaders If you want to get a message out, you need to focus on the message. When speaking with employees, this is especially important. Are you there to tell them how things should move forward and the great plans you have?  Sen. Booker undoubtedly wanted to rally people around his message, but because of the way he did it, the headlines and discussion are around the record, not the policies. Here are some things to think about when you are trying to get a message across: 1. Focus on substance over spectacle. Booker’s speech broke a record previously held by Sen. Strom Thurmond, who filibustered against the 1957 Civil Rights Act. While the delivery was historic, Booker’s speech inadvertently revived discussions about Thurmond’s opposition to civil rights—an unintended consequence that distracted from Booker’s intended message. Don’t let flashy execution overshadow your core message. If your team walks away talking about how you said something rather than what you said, you’ve missed the mark. Always ask: Will this method amplify my message or distract from it? 2. Tie actions to clear goals. The headlines made it clear that the speech was anti-Trump, but that’s something everyone already knew about Booker. With the focus on the broken record, the substance of Booker’s argument was lost in the coverage. As a leader, your actions should reinforce your goals and values. If you’re rolling out a new initiative or making a big announcement, ensure your team understands why it matters and how it impacts them directly. Avoid empty gestures. Make sure every action serves a purpose tied to your company’s vision. 3. Engage in two-way communication. While Booker occasionally took questions during his speech, the Associated Press noted that the move appeared to be more about giving himself breaks than fostering dialogue or finding solutions. For leaders in a business setting, this one-sided approach is ineffective. Communication is a two-way street. Make space for your team and employees to share their ideas and concerns. If the ideas are good, act on them, regardless of whether they came from the warehouse or the C-suite. Listening isn’t just polite; it’s strategic. Employees who feel heard are more engaged and motivated to contribute meaningfully to your organization’s success. 4. Don’t preach to the choir. Booker’s office reportedly received 28,000 calls during his speech, according to NBC News. It wasn’t clear who called, but the calls were likely from supporters who already agreed with him. While Booker’s speech was undeniably passionate, skeptics viewed it as a stunt and more about personal recognition than advancing meaningful dialogue around policy. While energizing your base is important, your efforts should move the needle with doubters or undecided audiences. The takeaway for leaders? Don’t focus solely on employees or customers who already believe in your vision or product. Reach out to those who are disengaged or skeptical.Take such opportunities as town halls to reach those employees who don’t have a grasp of your vision.  Tailor your communication to address doubts and challenges rather than just reinforcing what loyal supporters already know. Sen. Booker’s speech may have set a record, but its impact on policy discussions remains unclear because the focus shifted to him and his record, rather than his message. As a leader, your priority should be to the organization and its greater goals.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
