  "text": "The corporate market, made up of businesses with more than 100 employees, is shrinking. Over the past decade, with fewer and fewer of these businesses available to buy, private equity (PE) firms have been fighting over these middle market and enterprise-sized private businesses. In this space, the vast majority of deals getting done are add-on acquisitions, where larger private equity platform portfolio companies are typically adding on smaller businesses that bring additional customers and adjacent products to sell to their existing customers.  High net worth investors (family offices) have also aggressively joined the private equity space, exacerbating the reality of too much money chasing too few deals—the new normal. The result is a growing pool of capital in a shrinking corporate market. This is why you are getting cold calls to encourage and solicit the sale of your business. Founder-friendly capital is growing quickly For private equity to be successful investing down market in businesses with less than 100 employees, they have to offer founder-friendly options to get deals done. For most founders, it is not just about the money. They are seeking to protect their legacy, company culture, key team members, and sometimes even their company name. Many times, founders want to continue to operate the business or maintain a majority ownership. More and more deals are getting done now with these founder-friendly elements. One of the biggest attributes for a founder-friendly deal is the length of time a private equity firm wants to maintain its ownership stake in a business. Traditionally, the hold period is 5 years or less, given that most of these private equity funds were raised with capital with 10-year life. High net worth and institutional investors, which are the most common source of capital for PE funds, focus on return on investment but also when they will get their money back (liquidity).  These same investors now know that to deploy their investable capital, they must loosen up their liquidity parameters. This is resulting in the creation of PE funds with 20, 30, or even permanent lives (evergreen funds). The game has changed.  Private equity can support the entrepreneurial journey Private equity can unlock business’s ability to scale farther and faster. Investors are seeking founders who want to continue to invest in their legacy and team. They are willing do minority interest deals that are not on a 5-year clock anymore. These new truths are fueling more and more founder-friendly deals. The immediate and long-term benefits to entrepreneurs are enormous. Founders get to diversify their portfolio by taking the first bite of the apple and moving some of their assets to cash and other investments. Then, they can enjoy long-term growth alongside a private equity investor that is more open to prolonged investment holding periods. With aligned interests, there might just be a sizable second bite of the apple for the founder.",
