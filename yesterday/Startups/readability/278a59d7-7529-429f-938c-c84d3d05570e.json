Here's Why Small Details Made It Unsuccessful.1. Ignore caller IDs and even Google searches for customer service numbersYou can no longer rely on the once-cool technology (ask your grandparents) of caller ID. Scammers can easily spoof the tech nowadays (both name and number) with minimal effort. There have also been numerous reports of scams involving Google searches, where criminals put fake numbers on listings for banks, airlines, and other businesses. When in doubt, go to the business's website to find their number.2. Never share private account informationA bank employee will never ask for your PIN, password, or one-time access codes, Wells Fargo notes on its website.Related: Don't Open an Email If You See These Warning Signs — Because It Could Drain Your Bank Account, New Research Reveals3. Never send a payment to \"resolve\" a problemWells Fargo makes it clear that employees \"will never ask you to send money to anyone – including yourself\" for anything, especially the scammer's favorites: \"reverse a transfer\" or \"receive a refund.\" 4. Ignore and delete access codes you didn't initiateIf you receive a one-time access code to authorize a transaction you didn't initiate, don't use the code, Wells Fargo warns. The bank also recommends not sharing it with anyone and deleting the text without a reply.5. Hang up and contact the bank directlyThe odds of being contacted by a bank are rare, and if it is the actual bank calling, they won't be offended if you ask to call back. If the person on the phone is trying to get you to stay on the line or pressuring you for information, hang up and call the number on the back of your card or go into a branch.",
