The pair are joining up for a Valorant-focused Night Market designed to emulate the look and feel of Riot’s hotshot shooting game. Headlining the Night Market will be the NRG VALORANT Clout Clash, where VALORANT legends s0m and FNS will lead hand-picked teams of pros and influencers in a showdown that promises to captivate fans both in-person and online. They’ll battle it out on PCs powered by the new  Intel® Core™ Ultra 285K desktop processors from CyberPowerPC. The event will also host a special edition of the Intel Live! community show, bringing the show’s tech commentary and antics, in person, to the gaming community. “This partnership with Intel marks a significant milestone in NRG’s journey,” said Hauk Nelson, Director of Business Development at NRG. “By combining Intel’s technological prowess with our expertise in creating engaging content and experiences, we’re not just launching a product – we’re celebrating the passion and creativity of the global gaming community.” Asma Aziz, Director of Americas Marketing at Intel, added, “Collaborating with NRG allows us to connect with gamers in ways that go beyond traditional product launches. Our goal is to deliver great gaming performance with our new  Intel® Core™ Ultra desktop processors and make the PC the best place to play. The Intel x NRG Night Market embodies our commitment to creating memorable experiences with the community while fostering the vibrant culture that makes gaming so special.” GB Daily Stay in the know!
