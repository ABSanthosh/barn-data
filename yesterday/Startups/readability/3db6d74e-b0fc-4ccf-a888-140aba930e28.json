  "text": "When I was invited to join the LinkedIn Top Voices program, I was a little surprised. Just look at my profile: I’m a university professor, not a media personality or full-time content creator. I don’t post daily, and I don’t study the algorithm. I share what I know and what I’ve lived.So when people started asking how it happened, I realized something: a lot of professionals assume this kind of recognition is reserved for people with massive audiences or polished personal brands. It’s not. You don’t need to go viral. You need to share what you know. In 2025, visibility on LinkedIn comes from showing up with consistency, credibility, and something real to say. Here’s what that looks like in practice.Post less—but make it count.There’s no need to post every day. I don’t. Once a week is enough—if what you say counts. I focus on value: an insight from my research, a lesson from leadership, or something I’ve seen in the real world that others might relate to or learn from.A consistent schedule helps and so does format variety. For me, some weeks it’s a short, written reflection, other times a photo or a quick video. Visuals can make your message more relatable, especially when they connect to a real story or question. If you’re wondering whether you need a big audience to be noticed, you don’t. When LinkedIn approached me, I had just over 6,000 followers. There’s no application form. LinkedIn pays attention to who’s shaping conversations—not to who’s just making noise.You don’t need a brand. You need a point of view.Forget building a personal brand or obsessing about being a “thought leader.” Start with having a perspective. I write about leadership, workplace culture, and inclusion—topics shaped by both research and lived experience. But more important than the subject matter is the angle. What are you seeing that others are missing? What experience do you bring that changes the conversation?You don’t need to be a founder, investor, or senior executive to be credible. You just need to speak with clarity and purpose, and make sure your profile reflects that. A sharp headline and bio that signals your expertise and focus makes it easier for others to follow and engage.Don’t broadcast. Engage.Some of the most influential voices on LinkedIn don’t have huge audiences. What they do have is a habit of showing up in the comments, asking great questions, and building momentum around other people’s work.You don’t have to post right away. Start by engaging. Leave thoughtful comments. Share someone else’s insight with your take on it. Join conversations that matter to you.I try to engage a few times a week even when I’m not posting. It keeps things reciprocal and connected. The best content on LinkedIn often lives in the comments.Real stories land. Rehearsed ones don’t.Some of my most resonant posts weren’t carefully constructed arguments. They were honest reflections—on leadership missteps, on balancing work and parenthood, on what it feels like to be the only person of a certain background in the room. I’ve shared stories from my own life—about my Black wife of Caribbean descent, our two mixed-race children, and how their experiences shape the way I think about belonging and leadership. One post included images from a recent family trip to Disney World, where we talked as a family about identity and representation in the spaces we move through. That post wasn’t planned to perform. It was just honest—and it connected.Professionalism today doesn’t mean removing the personal. In fact, that’s where trust starts. Your edge isn’t polished. It’s honest. If you pair a meaningful story with a strong image, it often gets more reach—but the story has to serve more than just you. If it touches on something others are feeling or struggling with, that’s when it travels.Forget the badge. Focus on the impact.Becoming a Top Voice is a privilege—but it’s not the goal. The real win is when someone tells you that your post helped them ask for a raise, handle a difficult conversation, or feel less alone at work. If you aim for recognition, your content might feel forced. If you aim to help people, you’ll build a platform that matters, recognition or not.That also means watching for resonance, not just reach. Which posts start real conversations? Which ones spark direct messages, calls, or collaborations? Those are the metrics that count.And if you’re stuck on what to post, ask yourself: What’s something I wish more people were honest about in my industry? What do I wish I’d known five years ago? What’s a small story that says something bigger? Start there.Final thoughtYou don’t need a title, a strategy team, or a following to become influential on LinkedIn. You need a voice. One that’s grounded in what you believe and generous in what it shares. Show up consistently. Say something real. Join conversations that matter. That’s what gets noticed—and what creates real value long after the likes fade.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The super early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
