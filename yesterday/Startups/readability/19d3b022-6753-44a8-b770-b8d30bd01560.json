  "text": "The cryptocurrency-focused media outlet Unchained reports that Donald Trump has, according to three anonymous sources, tapped crypto-friendly Paul Atkins to be the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins is currently the chief executive of the strategy and risk management consulting agency Patomak Global Partners.One of Unchained’s sources told the digital outlet that Trump—who once said he’d make America the “crypto capital of the planet”—has asked Atkins to take on the SEC mantle but was still waiting on a response. A spokesperson for Trump’s transition team told Unchained that “remaining decisions will continue to be announced by him when they are made.”Another crypto outlet, CoinDesk, reports that Atkins is hesitant to accept the offer, with “a person familiar with Atkins’ thinking” telling the website that it’s “an unattractive role for him because of the amount of work needed to turn around the bloated agency.”Atkins previously served as an SEC commissioner between 2002 and 2008. His bio on the consultancy’s website adds that he has worked “to develop best practices for digital asset issuances and trading platforms as Co-Chair of the Token Alliance,” a crypto industry advocacy group, since 2017.He would in theory need Senate approval to take on the chairship, although speculation has swirled that Trump could force him through sooner with a recess appointment.“Senate Republicans really respect the tradition of Commissioner Paul Atkins,” George Mason University professor J.W. Verret told Unchained earlier this month. “He was the first time anyone had been a true libertarian and SEC commissioner, and that was a unique thing.”If Trump has indeed tapped the pro-crypto Atkins to be one of the top financial regulators in the country, it would represent a meaningful shift from the SEC’s approach to crypto under the outgoing Biden administration, whose own SEC chair Gary Gensler cast a skeptical eye on the alternative currency ecosystem and pursued enforcement actions against some of its biggest fish—earning him the industry’s ire.Trump had promised to fire Gensler “on day one” of his administration, but Gensler announced late last month that he would leave the position willingly in January.Bitcoin boomed in the wake of Trump’s election, signaling the crypto market’s enthusiasm that a new MAGA status quo will be good for the ecosystem. Among other things, Trump has said he wants to establish a national Bitcoin stockpile.NPR reports that almost half of corporate spending in the 2024 federal elections came from crypto backers, spurred in part by frustrations with Biden’s regulatory regime.Trump has already chosen another crypto supporter, Howard Lutnick of the firm Cantor Fitzgerald, to head up the Commerce Department. The twice-elected commander-in-chief has also said he’ll create a crypto advisory council, which major crypto firms are now angling to get seats on.",
