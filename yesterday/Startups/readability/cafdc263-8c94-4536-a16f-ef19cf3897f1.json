  "text": "A group of 45 former and current Scale AI contractors have written to senators on the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, detailing a multitude of complaints from their time working at the unicorn data-labeling startup. The email, addressed to the committee’s ranking member, Senator Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), warns officials about the growing prominence of a startup situated at the heart of the commercial AI revolution. The former contractors call for a Department of Labor investigation into Scale for what they describe as a history of “wage theft” and “widespread labor abuses,” as the company continues to compete for lucrative contracts with the Department of Defense. The letter, seen by Inc., was sent on Friday, February 21, and cites the company’s deepening ties to the Trump White House. On his second day in office, President Trump announced his ambition to lead in the race to dominate global AI development through Stargate, a joint venture with OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle, to build data centers throughout the country—worth a potential $500 billion over four years. A spokesperson for Commerce Committee Democrats wouldn’t comment, though Inc. has seen a response from Cantwell’s office seeking a meeting with at least two members of the group. Republicans on the Committee have so far not responded, according to a member of the group. Scale AI’s appeal to the Trump administrationThe group’s message to the committee is timed ahead of Tuesday’s Senate confirmation hearing of Michael Kratsios, who served as Scale’s managing director from 2021 until earlier this month, when he was nominated by Trump to lead the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Kratsios previously served as the White House’s chief technology officer during Trump’s first administration. In their letter, contractors say of Kratsios: “While we do not have specific information about his role in Scale AI’s labor practices, his leadership position at Scale suggests that he was aware of the company’s employment strategies.” San Francisco-based Scale AI was valued at $14 billion last May when it netted $1 billion in venture capital funding. Its 28-year-old CEO and co-founder, Alexandr Wang, has been making the rounds in Washington and on the global political scene. Wang met with house speaker Mike Johnson earlier this month in addition to the U.K. prime minister Keir Starmer, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, and French president Emmanuel Macron.Both Wang and the company have been vocal about America’s need to lead the AI race. Scale placed an ad in The Washington Post last month urging President Trump to “win the AI war with China.” Wang also penned an open letter to the president with the same message. Tens of thousands of dollars in unpaid workBy providing contract labor that helps train AI tools for accuracy, Scale is a middleman among the more prominent developers of large language models. It has clients ranging from OpenAI, Google, and Meta to the DOD, which awarded the company a $250 million contract in 2022. Scale usually farms out the work of annotating data to contractors who work for its subsidiaries, Outlier AI and Remotasks, for hourly wages. As Scale’s profile has grown, allegations of failed payments have been made by many former contractors on numerous occasions. The company has also been named in a class action lawsuit from former contractors alleging emotional distress while training a suicide prevention tool, and another complaint regarding worker misclassification under California law. In response to questions from Inc., Scale AI spokesperson Joe Osborne said, “Michael Kratsios is a stellar technologist and nominee, and his former work at Scale had nothing to do with contractor workforce operations … while we were not provided a copy of the letter in advance of this story running, we strongly disagree with the gross mischaracterizations of Outlier that we’ve learned of thus far.” The former Scale workers who wrote Friday’s letter mostly held positions under what they describe as queue management. Under these roles, the workers, or “QMs,” evaluate the work of other independent contractors who perform tasks to train AI models. In their letter to Senator Cantwell, the contractors write that they are “aware of very serious issues including wage theft among contractors not paid because of technical glitches, denial of bonuses promised and earned, below-minimum-wage rates to take assessments that never lead to actual work, project-based pay that is lower than rates promised when hired, and more.” The contractors note that both those in the QM middle-management positions and contributors working beneath them were often paid less than advertised. “We were stonewalled when trying to help these 1099 workers seek payment and compensation for work performed. Every one of us is aware of tens of thousands of dollars still unpaid to these workers,” the letter says. Potential conflict of interest for Trump’s nomineeThe letter notes that the potential appointment of Kratsios to the White House’s chief science role creates “concerns about conflicts of interest and the objectivity of AI policy decisions,” given Kratsios’s ties with his former employer. The Stargate project plans to allot an initial $100 billion to build out infrastructure to help the U.S. build AI tools. In their letter, contractors note the project will invariably create an influx of new data that needs to be trained, and therefore potential contracts for Scale.   This is concerning given Scale’s growing prominence and its history of alleged labor violations, the letter states. “We believe that [neither] companies—nor leaders—that ignore labor laws should pave the way for how the booming AI industry conducts itself when it comes to the treatment of its workers.”The contractors are hoping their allegations will be aired during Tuesday’s hearing. Kratsios is expected to be confirmed. The application deadline for Inc.'s Best Workplaces Awards is Friday, March 7, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply Today.",
