  "description": "Wellness is no longer just an employee perk — it’s an imperative business strategy. Cesar Carvalho, co-founder and CEO of Wellhub (formerly Gympass), joins host Jeff Berman to make that case and share his vision for the B2B platform providing wellness services and gym access to people worldwide via their employers. Hear why he quit his consulting job and Harvard Business School to start the company, now valued at $2.4 billion. Cesar reveals how personal pain points became the blueprint for global scale, why he dared to rebrand at the height of success, and how movement keeps him grounded in stressful times.Subscribe to the Masters of Scale weekly newsletter: https://mastersofscale.com/subscribeSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
