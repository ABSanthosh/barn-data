  "text": "At our recent GamesBeat Next event, we held our ninth Women in Gaming Breakfast, where I had the opportunity of speaking with Dametra Johnson-Marletti, Microsoft’s CVP of digital gaming sales. Following a theme at our event of looking to the future of gaming — in this case, more growth and an abatement of the layoffs that have plagued 2024 — we spoke about the future of gaming employment and how the industry itself can foster talent. Johnson-Marletti gave some advice for young job-seekers who wish to enter the games industry, including that which she wished someone had given her: Don’t be afraid to fix what isn’t broken. Take your time to build a great network. Build a personal board of directors, comprised of mentors and trusted advisors. Find your voice early in your career. “The people who have been there for 20-plus years, like me — we don’t have all the answers. Nobody does,” said Johnson Marletti. “You’re there for a reason. Throw your ideas out there. Find your voice. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes or say something dumb. The collective of all these varied experiences makes for the best result in the end.” How game companies can retain new talent One of the points Johnson-Marletti spoke with me about was what responsibilities fall to the companies who wish to hire the next generation of gaming talent — after all, the onus is not just on the new employees. “The race for talent is real. There’s no shortage of companies that want great people within their organization.” This falls in line with Amir Satvat’s predictions, in another panel at the event, that hiring will grow in 2025. Johnson-Marletti said that one of the key areas of focus for companies interested in retaining talent is creating a welcoming culture. “The onus is on the company to make sure that they have the right culture where people feel valued and respected and they’re challenged with great new opportunities.” She also pointed to a clear and recognizable mission being a great factor in helping young talent identify with and understand a company for which they wish to work. She also expanded on the role that representation and diversity can play in the hiring process, citing the experience of young talent: “Make sure people can look around the organization and see themselves being able to succeed in that place. That speaks to representation across the board. Nothing is better than when somebody walks in and they’re interviewing for a role and they see senior executives who look like them. It inspires a belief that, ‘I can be that someday.'” GB Daily Stay in the know! Get the latest news in your inbox daily By subscribing, you agree to VentureBeat's Terms of Service.
