Perhaps it‚Äôs time to switch everything to WordPress‚Ä¶It started with this tweet (yes, they are still tweets to me).Amazingly, X has changed the link from something on the open web to a dead link on LinkedIn. Here's the original link (that clearly some people saw.https://t.co/7uBIjd0Rpg‚Äî Brad Feld (@bfeld) May 24, 2025I did the link correctly, but then X broke something several hours later, and I found out when someone pointed out to me (by email) that it was going to a dead link on LinkedIn. More than an hour had passed, so I could no longer fix what X broke randomly. So, I just replied with the link again, which is The Copilot Delusion by Jj. X seems to have now fixed the link (it redirects to the proper place), but didn‚Äôt fix the image that was in the original tweet.Roj Niyogi then asked Grok, ‚ÄúDo you think this is an oversimplification? Doesn‚Äôt vibe coding simply move the goal posts?Grok responded with a summary almost as long as the original post. Someone then asked Grok for a tldr and got this:TL;DR: ‚ÄúThe Copilot Delusion‚Äù (May 2025) critiques AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot, arguing they produce sloppy, contextless code and foster lazy programming habits. While acknowledging their utility for boilerplate or syntax help, the author warns that overreliance degrades coding skills, understanding, and the ‚Äúhacker soul.‚Äù AI lacks nuance, ignores performance (e.g., cache misses, memory locality), and risks normalizing mediocrity, turning passionate programmers into apathetic button-clickers. True programming requires grappling with the machine, not outsourcing thought to bots.We are now in the reductionist world of not getting the joy and beauty of what Jj wrote. While Grok‚Äôs much too long analysis and TL;DR cover the highlights, much of the flavor is eliminated. I read Jj‚Äôs post as deliciously snarky, sarcastic, frustrated, amused, and cranky. The signal in it was strong, but there was a lot to consider. When Grok played back this in its extended response, using short phrases and summarized quips, it was like turning a color movie to black and white, or making emotional dialogues into robotic monologues.Finally, as I was writing this post, I noticed this tweet.This is mostly the opposite of what nearly every S tier engineer at Foundations will tell you. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äî aviel (@aviel) May 24, 2025I‚Äôm not sure if Aviel read Jj‚Äôs post (I hope so), but I guess my tweet could be interpreted as ‚ÄúI endorse the conclusion.‚Äù I have no idea if Jj‚Äôs conclusion (Chapter 5: Conclusion) is correct, but I thought the way he built his argument and made the conclusion was beautiful writing, which I deeply enjoy.
