  "text": "The good news for company founders and executives who travel for work is that U.S. airlines are pulling out the stops to create even bigger, cushier seating options for business class passengers. The bad news is that the economic disruption—and even anger—generated by President Donald Trump’s tariff and immigration policies could be a reason that many businesses are cutting back on employee trips.Those diverging travel trends are clearly visible in a pair of recently released reports. This week, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecast that despite the growing risk of a trade war and fears of slowing global economic growth, business in the sky is still expected to keep booming. The IATA said worldwide airline revenues are on course to rise 1.3 percent, to a record high of $979 billion in 2025, with profits set to increase to $36 billion, up from the $32.4 billion earned in 2024. Top-dollar business travel is an increasingly big driver of that activity.“The first half of 2025 has brought significant uncertainties to global markets,” said IATA director general Willie Walsh in the report. “Nonetheless, by many measures including net profits, it will still be a better year for airlines than 2024, although slightly below our previous projections.”By contrast, a Global Business Travel Association survey found the positive sentiment expressed by 67 percent of its members last November had plunged to 31 percent by April. That decline was fueled by nearly a third of respondents saying companies they work for had cut plans to send employees on business trips in response to U.S. trade and immigration policies. An additional 20 percent said they still weren’t sure how their bosses would respond.The biggest concerns affecting travel for work “related to the long-term impact of recent U.S. government actions” included higher costs, increased processing and administration requirements to enter the country, decreased employee willingness to go to the U.S., and further down, the risk of border detentions.The 38 percent of respondents who said their employers had already or were considering scaling back or canceling business trips to the U.S. may not seem surprising. Less expected, however, were the nearly 30 percent of American participants who reported their companies were doing the same because of growing uncertainty amid Trump administration policies.But if a growing number of employers are telling their people to unpack their bags before they even leave for the airport, airlines are doing all they can to attract increasing numbers of business travelers on their flights—especially on longer international routes. American and United have stepped up their efforts to follow Delta’s early lead in shifting the revenue growth focus from the larger pool of passengers who buy economy seats to the far higher profit tickets sold to business travelers.That involves airlines enlarging sections for those working voyagers—often reducing space set aside for first-class passengers as they do. They’re also creating a range of increasingly plush options that include sliding doors that shut off enclosed seats from the aisle, and even offering self-contained suites providing hotel-like accommodations at 36,000 feet.Extras lavished on passengers up front include pajamas, complementary high-tech gadgets like noise-canceling earphones, and helpings of caviar and champagne. They also don’t have to compete in the foot races and wrestling matches for overhead bin space, as most other fliers do.The reason carriers are dedicating this much effort and cabin space to business travelers? For starters, those tickets can be sold from triple to nearly 10 times the price of economy seats. Meanwhile, squeezing their first-class sections doesn’t really deprive airlines much, so long as companies keep sending their employees on trips.“Business is starting to become so similar [to first class] it was hard to really differentiate, and we want to make sure we offer as many business-class seats as we can,” American Airlines chief customer officer Heather Garboden told CNBC—adding that despite the fears voiced in the Global Business Travel Association survey, people are traveling for work in increasingly bigger numbers. “We’re at a really uncertain economic time right now, and premium demand has remained solid.”Robert Mann, president of R.W. Mann \u0026 Co. aviation consultancy, said there’s another reason why airlines are shrinking first-class sections to create more space for business passengers.“A lot of corporations will not permit the purchase of first class, but they will permit business class,” Mann told CNBC, before noting that at the end of the day, airlines that fulfill their primary objectives will likely prevail over those that come up short, even as they offer flying hotel suites. “I could be sitting up front or I can be sitting in the back, but if the plane’s late, the plane’s late.”The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
