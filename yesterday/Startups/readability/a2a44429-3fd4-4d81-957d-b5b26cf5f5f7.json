He is worth over $16 billion at the time of writing, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with most of his fortune coming from his $6.65 billion stake in Bridgewater.\"The best advice that I could give anybody, I think, it would be to meditate, and that's because it gives you a calmness and equanimity,\" Dalio told CNBC earlier this week. \"Whatever success I've had in life has been more due to my meditating than anything else.\" Related: Worried About the Market? Here's How Warren Buffett, Ray Dalio, and Harvard University Protect Their PortfoliosDalio disclosed in 2021 to the outlet that he practices transcendental meditation, which involves repeating a mantra or a short sound or word for a set amount of time, for twenty minutes, twice a day. The aim is to focus the mind and help the practitioner achieve a state of deep relaxation. Dalio says that each 20-minute meditation session feels like a \"20-minute vacation\" that calms him down and helps him make better decisions. He comes up with creative ideas during his sessions, emerging with a clearer mind.Ray Dalio.

A March 2020 study published in the journal \"Brain and Cognition\" showed that participants who practiced transcendental meditation felt less depression, anxiety, and stress.Dalio first started meditating in 1968, seven years before founding Bridgewater Associates. He was inspired by The Beatles, who popularized the practice in 1967. Dalio sustained the practice for the following five decades of the hedge fund's growth before stepping down as co-CEO in 2017. Under his leadership, Bridgewater established a management style called \"radical transparency,\" which means that all meetings are recorded and available to the entire organization and constructive criticism of colleagues is encouraged.
