And when I look at Bad Bunny, I see one of the best marketing masterminds in the world right now. His recent album Debí Tirar Más Fotos and the corresponding residency he’s performing in Puerto Rico are a perfect case study on how to emotionally connect with your audience and quantify success through significant economic impact. Let’s start with his residency. Bad Bunny made history by becoming the first artist to hold a residency in Puerto Rico, performing 21 concerts over seven weekends at the iconic Coliseo stadium. This is not a tour—each of these concerts will be in Puerto Rico, creating a unique and deeply human connection with his home audience. This is a game-changer because artists like Adele and Bruno Mars have done residencies in Las Vegas, but no one has ever done this on such a grand scale in Puerto Rico. And the impact? It’s projected to generate over $100 million for the island’s economy, boosting local tourism and creating jobs. The power of culture and identity is undeniable. Sell an experience Now let’s dive into the marketing brilliance behind this move. The first key lesson I learned from Bad Bunny is how he takes his audience on a cultural journey with him. His album Debí Tirar Más Fotos isn’t just an album—it’s a cultural manifesto. By mixing modern reggaeton with traditional Puerto Rican genres like salsa and plena, Bad Bunny taps into universal feelings of nostalgia and regret. These emotions are something we all understand, and that’s exactly how he connects with his audience. He doesn’t just sing; he connects with the hearts of Boricuas, his people, my people, and that’s what makes his music and marketing so powerful. When I look at this from a business perspective, the lesson is clear: You don’t just sell a product, you sell an experience, a connection. Bad Bunny’s residency and album title both play on universal truths that everyone can relate to—regret and nostalgia. These aren’t just buzzwords; they’re emotions that resonate with his audience, making the product (his music, his concerts, his brand) something deeply personal. He’s not selling music; he’s creating a cultural movement. And isn’t that what we, as entrepreneurs, do? This is a marketing masterclass, and it goes beyond traditional methods. Bad Bunny has broken the mold by creating experiences that go viral. His residency announcement included subtle marketing cues, like two white chairs that appeared in the Puerto Rican Coliseum, directly referencing the album cover. These small details create a buzz that engages his fans and leaves them eager to be part of the experience. It’s a reminder that viral moments happen when there’s a deep, real connection between you and your audience. As a business owner, I ask myself: Am I creating content or products that people can connect with on an emotional level? Am I offering something that resonates with my customers’ identity, values, and feelings? This is what Bad Bunny is doing with his residency—which sold out in 24 hours—and his album. He’s tapping into the heart of Puerto Rican culture and creating an experience that people want to be a part of.  787 Coffee was born in Puerto Rico and we started as a coffee farm, so supporting the local community has always been a priority. Just as 787 Coffee is committed to giving back to Puerto Rico and its people through sustainable practices and community-building efforts, Bad Bunny uses his success to support causes that benefit Puerto Rico, from social justice to philanthropic initiatives. Lessons from Bad Bunny’s marketing What can we learn from Bad Bunny’s marketing genius?  Emotional connections drive sales: People buy products they feel connected to, and they become loyal when they feel seen and understood.  Cultural relevance is key: Bad Bunny connects with Puerto Rican, Caribbean, and the Latino identity and culture, something that is important not just in music but in any industry.  Create an experience, not just a product: Bad Bunny’s residency isn’t just about concerts; it’s about offering his fans a chance to connect with something bigger than themselves, something cultural, something nostalgic.  Bad Bunny’s success isn’t just about being the biggest artist in the world; it’s about creating a legacy. He’s not just performing—he’s shaping the cultural and economic landscape of Puerto Rico.  As a business, as an entrepreneur, we don’t have to be singers or artists to apply these principles. We need to connect authentically with customers, tap into universal emotions, understand our brand DNA and what we stand for, and create experiences that humans can’t resist being a part of. In the end, it’s not about flashy ads or viral trends; it’s about building a genuine relationship with your audience. And Bad Bunny has mastered that.",
