  "text": "It’s been a tough few years for plant-based food company Beyond Meat, but CEO and founder Ethan Brown has a plan for a comeback. And as the company’s name suggests, its newest product won’t look much like the mock chicken, beef, or pork that consumers have come to expect. In fact, Beyond Meat’s next act is producing food that doesn’t imitate anything.“It’s not trying to be beef, pork, or poultry. It’s simply a very high protein, center-of-the-plate product that can be used in any dishes you’d use any ground meat in,” Brown says. ”It’s just called Beyond Ground.”Beyond Ground, which a company spokesperson emphasized is a working name for the product, will have only four ingredients: water, fava bean protein, potato protein, and psyllium husk, a type of fiber. It will contain about 27 grams of protein, and no added oil. Brown says Beyond Meat plans to introduce the product in a controlled, “iterative” way, first to chefs as well as influencers and creators in the food and recipe space to gain feedback. It will ultimately launch to consumers, although the dates and locations have yet to be determined. Brown says it could debut by this fall.The Beyond Ground launch is only one part of Beyond Meat’s strategy to climb its way back from near collapse. Beyond Meat has had a meteoric rise and fall. Founded in 2009, the plant-based meat darling went public in May 2019, kicking off trading on the Nasdaq under ticker symbol BYND. Just a few months later, the company’s stock ballooned to about $235 per share in what would turn out to be an all-time high. Since then, Beyond Meat shares have lost close to 99 percent of their value. Beyond Meat stock closed down the trading day at $3.41 per share on Thursday.The surging stock price coincided with broad optimism around meat replacement products. The introduction of products from companies like Beyond Meat and rival Impossible Foods promised improved taste and texture that could capture not only vegans and vegetarians, but meat eaters. Consumers are also drawn to plant-based meat alternatives for their substantially reduced environmental footprint compared to animal meats.Close to three quarters of consumers aged 18 to 59 are open to eating plant-based meat, according to data from the Good Food Institute (GFI), a nonprofit think tank that promotes plant-based alternatives. Sales of plant-based meats in the U.S. hit $1.4 billion in 2020, a 45 percent increase from the previous year, and held relatively steady through 2022, after which sales began to tumble, according to GFI data.Beyond Meat’s net revenue peaked at about $465 million during fiscal 2021, and declined about 30 percent to $327 million in fiscal 2024.A targeted campaignDropping sales in the industry coincided with a 2019 advertising campaign by the Center for Consumer Freedom, as reported by Fortune. The lobbying organization does not disclose where it gets its funding on its website, but does say it is supported by “restaurants, food companies and thousands of individual consumers.” The CCF took out full-page ads in publications like The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, placed op-eds in similar publications, and even ran a Super Bowl commercial questioning the health benefits of plant-based meats. Ads referred to plant-based meats as “ultra-processed imitations,” and even compared them to dog food, Fast Company reported. (It’s worth noting that processed meats like hot dogs, canned meats and sausages have been classified as carcinogens, and red meat as a probable carcinogen, according to the World Health Organization.)Marion Nestle, a professor emerita of nutrition, food studies, and public health at New York University, says that the campaign from the Center for Consumer Freedom was “devastating,” particularly the comparison of ingredients in certain plant-based meats with dog food. She notes that plant-based meats do fall into the ultra-processed category, and there are indeed some concerns with that. “[Ultra-processed foods] encourage people to eat more calories than they might otherwise, and not realize it,” Nestle writes via email. “Is isolated pea protein healthier than eating peas? I don’t think so.”  In response to the messaging, Beyond Meat doubled down on its own, touting its contribution to a 2020 Stanford Medicine study that demonstrated cardiovascular benefits from swapping red meat with plant-based alternatives. In February 2024, Beyond Meat announced it had reformulated its recipe for plant-based meats, starting with its burger and beef and soon expanding to include its sausage. This new category of products, called Beyond IV, features a pared back recipe list and includes changes like pivoting to avocado oil from coconut oil, reducing the sodium in its products, and diversifying protein sources to include protein from peas, red lentils, fava beans, and rice.“We knew [our products] were really healthy, but we wanted to make them unassailable,” Brown says.Furthermore, the company released a short film in April, called “Planting Change,” which, among other things, details the CCF campaign and how it led to  mistrust among consumers. Jody Kirchner, associate director of market insights at Good Food Institute, agrees there’s little doubt the advertising campaign took a toll on certain consumers. But she says only a specific subset of consumers are concerned with the nutritional profile of plant-based meats, and that for other consumers, “that is not necessarily a particularly salient issue.” Two other pressing issues that may have played into the decline, according to both Kirchner and Nestle, are taste and cost. Kirchner emphasizes that both are “extremely important,” adding, “I don’t think solving for one and not addressing the other will get us where we need to be.”The cost issueWhen it comes to cost, the decline in popularity of plant-based meat alternatives has come amid economic uncertainty. Beyond Meat went public shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic, and more recent years have seen consumers squeezed by surging cost of living, inflation, and now tariffs. “Plant-based meat products are often priced two- to three-times higher than conventional counterparts, which is a challenge for consumers,” Kirchner says. “That’s become even more salient in the last couple years with inflation. Consumer budgets are tighter, and they’re less willing to purchase premium price products in many cases.”Brown says Beyond Meat doesn’t disclose the cost-per-pound for its products, as compared with meat, but achieving cost parity with meat is a major focus.“Over time, we will under-price animal protein, and at that point, the floodgates will open,” Brown says. “There will be massive disruption, when we can provide very clean, healthy protein that people understand to be better for them at a price that is lower than animal protein, that will be a transitional moment.”Rival Impossible Foods seems to be adopting a different approach. Impossible Foods CEO Peter McGuinness, who joined the company from Chobani in 2022, has previously condemned his own industry’s strategy of painting itself as more virtuous than meat, and teased in early June the company could be contemplating a new hybrid meat product to capture the flexitarian audience.It may be too soon to say whether Beyond’s recovery strategy is working, but a recent influx of capital has bought Beyond Meat some time to find out. Beyond Meat received $100 million in debt financing from Unprocessed Foods, an affiliate of plant-based advocacy nonprofit the Ahimsa Foundation, in exchange for warrants to purchase up to 12.5 percent of Beyond’s outstanding shares. Brown says the lifeline has helped to strengthen Beyond’s balance sheet as it pushes toward a future where plant-based protein stands on its own. For Brown, Beyond Ground is the jumping off point for products that no longer live in the shadow of conventional meat.“I want people to think more about it being Beyond, versus, ‘This tastes just like beef or pork or poultry,’ I want them to associate it very closely with the farms where the crops are grown,” Brown says. “You’re getting your protein right from the field. That’s the difference.”As for the future of the industry, GFI’s Kirchner notes that although sales have declined in recent years, the overall market is still about twice the size as it was just under a decade ago.“We see a huge segment of the population open to these products. There is certainly work to do around taste and price and value proposition to capture that demand, but it exists,” Kirchner says. “There is a lot of opportunity for growth in this category.”The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
