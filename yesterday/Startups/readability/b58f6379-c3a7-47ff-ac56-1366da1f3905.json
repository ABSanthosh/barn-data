Credit card issuers know that small business owners value simplicity and straightforward rewards.By making eligible purchases with these cards, businesses can earn cash back, which can then be used as a statement credit, helping to minimize operational expenses.What are Credit Cards with Cash Back?Cash back credit cards are a popular financial product that essentially rewards consumers for using the card. Instead of accumulating points or miles, users receive a percentage of their purchases back in the form of cash.For instance, consider a business owner who has a credit card boasting a 2% cash back rate. If they were to utilize this card for transactions totaling $2,000 in a specific billing period and settle the amount, they would earn a cash back reward of $40.This cash back can manifest in various ways depending on the card’s terms and conditions. While some cards might apply this amount as a credit against future bills, others might offer options to redeem it for other rewards or even automatically deduct it from the upcoming statement.Why You Should Consider Business Credit Cards with Cash BackSimplicity – It’s a percentage you can easily calculate. There are no complicated cash rewards programs to track. You can set up an automatic statement credit.With many of these cards, there is no annual fee.Many cash back cards also have a 0% introductory APR. Combine that with no annual fee, and that will help you save money.You can earn cash back on qualifying purchases. These eligible purchases may be restricted to business transactions at office supply stores or could encompass a wider range of expenses, such as advertising costs or internet, cable, and phone services.Since the cards are geared to businesses, you’ll find no foreign transaction fees.
