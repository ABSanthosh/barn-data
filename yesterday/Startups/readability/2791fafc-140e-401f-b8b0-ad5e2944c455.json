  "text": "May 13, 2025 4:13 PM Marvel 1943: Rise of HydraImage Credit: Skydance/GamesBeat Skydance Interactive announced today that its upcoming action-adventure game Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will not longer target a 2025 release, but instead has been moved to an early 2026 window. The company revealed the delay in a social media post, saying the game requires “more polish” in order to deliver the best possible user experience. This makes Marvel 1943 the second triple-A game this month pushed to 2026 following an initial planned 2025 launch window. Skydance first announced Marvel 1943 at the Game Developers Conference in 2024. It’s described the game as a narrative-driven action-adventure game set in the titular year, and it follows the adventures of Captain America and the WW2-era Black Panther, Azzuri. Skydance is creating the game in cooperating with Plaion, and the graphics shown at GDC appear to be incredibly realistic. The studio has thus far not revealed too much about the story, except that the two will be joined by two other heroes — Howling Commando Gabe Jones and Wakandan spy Nanali — and presumably oppose the villainous organization Hydra. The fact the game is penned by games industry veteran Amy Hennig, known for the Uncharted series, among others. This is not the first major title to be delayed from a planned 2025 launch date. Earlier this month, Rockstar Games revealed that it had set a May 2026 launch date for Grand Theft Auto VI; the game was originally scheduled for a fall 2025 window. One of the side effects of such a large game announcing a release window is that other publishers seemed to be reluctant to announce their own, lest they inadvertently land on the same day or even week. Marvel 1943’s delay is likely not related, but an “early” 2026 launch window might mean Skydance intends to release it before Rockstar’s juggernaut. GB Daily Stay in the know!
