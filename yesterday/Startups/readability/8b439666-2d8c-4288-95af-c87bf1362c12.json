Minecraft also announced movie updates, including an exclusive clip from A Minecraft Movie and details about an in-game live event during the Minecraft Live broadcast. Players will be able to experience new variants of the chicken, pig, and cow, along with new ambient features and sounds on March 25, 2025. Additionally, players will also be able to anticipate flying across the Overworld on the back of a happy ghast later this year on all platforms. Here’s a full look at the announcements from Minecraft Live 2025, as well as the new features coming to Minecraft later this year: Spring to Life First game drop of the year: Mojang’s Agnes Larsson introduced the next game drop, Spring to Life, which launches on March 25, 2025 and features the following: New mob variants for the pig, cow, and chicken: Besides the original pig, cow, and chicken, warm and cold pigs/cows/chickens can be found in sandy biomes and chilly biomes respectively. Sheep spawning: Sheep have adapted to the climate and most brown sheep now spawn in sandy biomes, black sheep in chilly biomes, and white sheep in green biomes. The famously rare pink sheep are unchanged and can still be found in all climates. New wolf variant sounds: When a wolf spawns, it will now get one of seven personalities, unrelated to their variant or biome. From cute to grumpy, each wolf will now bark, growl, pant, whine, and express themselves in their own unique way. Ambient desert sounds — Howling wind, chirping crickets, or whispers of sand can be heard coming from terracotta blocks, sand blocks, and the dead bush. Falling leaves — Matching the color of the trees they fall from, these particles will make strolls (or chases) under the trees even more ambient. Leaf litter (including ambient sounds) — Leaf litter can be used to decorate blocks and makes a rustling sound when players walk through it. Explore forests, dark forests, and wooded badlands to find different colored leaf litter, or craft it by placing leaves in a furnace. Wildflowers — These white and yellow flowers can be crafted into dye and placed at different angles up to four times on the same block. Wildflowers can be found in meadows, birch forests, and old growth birch forests or grow more using bone meal. Dry grass — Two types of dry grass now grow in deserts and badlands. Use bone meal on short dry grass and it’ll grow tall, or on tall dry grass to grow another short dry grass plant. Sheep will also regrow their wool once they eat either variant of dry grass. Happy Ghast Cactus flower — The new cactus flower is pink, grows on our prickliest plant block, and can be crafted into dye. Place this desert flower in builds for a pop of color and to attract bees. Firefly bush (plant block) — Growing in swamps and near water, this new plant block spawns moving firefly particles that glow in the dark. Bury the firefly bush below blocks to make builds sparkle and use bone meal to grow more firefly bushes. Bush — Find this tuft of greenery sprouting in forests, birch forests, plains, windswept hills, and other green biomes, or grow more bushes by using bone meal. Lodestone (updated recipe) — Only an iron ingot is needed with chiseled bricks to craft a lodestone. By using a compass on a lodestone placed in players’ bases, the compass will always point home, which means players can dare venture even farther. New maps for cartographers — Instead of hoping to stumble upon a certain biome or village, maps leading to them are now purchaseable from cartographers. Each cartographer has their own selection of maps, so the more village types are explored, the more maps can be found! Updates to the wandering traders — Our llama-leading traders have changed their business strategy: not only are they selling and buying more things, but at lower prices too! A great way for new players especially to stock up before a journey. Spawn egg textures (Creative mode) — Spawn eggs in Creative mode now look like the mob type it spawns. With their different colors, sizes, and distinct characteristics like horns, snouts, or wings, it’ll be easier to find the right spawn egg in players’ inventories. Second game drop of 2025 Minecraft Movie live event Mojang’s Agnes Larsson introduced some of the features coming to the next game drop, including the exciting ability to fly across the Overworld on the back of a happy ghast! Find a dried ghast (can be found in the Nether or crafted from ghast tears and a bone block). Then, players will need to revive the dried ghast with water to spawn a ghastling. Only once a ghastling has grown into a full-sized happy ghast will they be able to equip a dyeable ghast harness and fly. Multiple players can also fly together atop the same ghast! These features will be coming into testing soon after Minecraft LIVE, so that players can test these new blocks, meet the ghastling and happy ghast, test flight in Minecraft, and provide feedback. New features for this drop announced at Minecraft LIVE include: Vibrant Visuals: Mojang’s Jens Bergensten introduced a visual graphics upgrade that will transform the way players experience Minecraft. Initially releasing for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, it is our developers’ vision for what Minecraft looks like with improved visual elements such as directional lighting, volumetric fog, and more. This is a visual enhancement — there are no changes to Minecraft’s gameplay. For example, visual shadows will not impact light levels in a game-mechanics sense, or affect where hostile mobs spawn. Vibrant Visuals will be easy to access and approachable for many more Minecraft players, as it will be available on many platforms as a simple menu toggle. While Vibrant Visuals will initially release on compatible Minecraft: Bedrock Edition devices, this is just the first step, and we plan to bring Vibrant Visuals to Minecraft: Java Edition in the future. A Minecraft Movie updates: A Minecraft Movie cast member, Emma Myers, revealed an exclusive clip from the upcoming movie, as well as announced the A Minecraft Movie Live Event, an evolving multiplayer event where players will defend Midport Village in three mini games. Completing the five challenges for the event will give players the Yearn cape. GB Daily Stay in the know! Get the latest news in your inbox daily Read our Privacy Policy Thanks for subscribing.
