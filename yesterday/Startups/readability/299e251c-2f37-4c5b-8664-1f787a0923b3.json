  "text": "Neowiz announced today that it has partnered with developer WolfEye Studios on the latter’s second title, an unnamed first-person action-RPG set in a retrofuturistic setting. Neowiz will distribute the game globally on its as-yet-unknown release date. WolfEye also revealed more details about the game, including concept art of the game’s look and feel. WolfEye’s team includes Raf Colantonio and Julien Roby, both of whom formerly worked on Dishonored and Prey (2017), and the studio’s previous title was 2022’s Weird West. According to the studio, its new game will blend “a rugged environment with layers of futuristic style to deliver something unique to audiences.” Seungchul Kim, Neowiz co-CEO, said in a statement, “Partnering with a studio brimming with incredible talent at Wolfeye is a timely and strategic fit for us. This collaboration reaffirms our commitment to delivering remarkable story-driven games that resonate with gamers worldwide on PC and console platforms.” The publisher has recently partnered with other developers on upcoming titles, including Zakazane on a Wild West-themed game and Lizard Smoothie on its upcoming MOBA roguelike Shape of Dreams. Colantonio said in a separate statement, “We have a burning passion for making a very specific type of game that blends RPG, action and simulation. These games can only be successful when the publisher shares that same passion.” Roby added, “With NEOWIZ, we found a partner that truly understands our vision and is as committed as we are to delivering a unique, creative and memorable game experience that will appeal both to our long-term fans and new players alike,” GB Daily Stay in the know!
