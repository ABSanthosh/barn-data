  "text": "There’s a universal and extraordinary sensation that emerges when you join a team that functions seamlessly as a unit. People support one another while ideas naturally flow, leading to impressive achievements without destructive conflict. It’s truly a situation where teamwork makes the dream work. While many people and organizations have tried to figure out what it takes to build a great team, Google took this effort one big step further, embarking on a multiyear research project—Project Aristotle—to find the answer. Through Project Aristotle, Google studied hundreds of its teams—analyzing a mountain of data in the process—to determine what was different between the company’s high-performing teams and the teams that didn’t function as well. The key discovery of their research turned out to be neither an intricate algorithm nor any specific personality combination. It was something surprisingly human. The researchers discovered after years of investigation that the most significant factor determining team performance was the way team members treated each other instead of their individual identities. Moreover, Google also found that psychological safety is the single most important factor for creating a stellar team.The value of psychological safety in the workplaceThe core feeling of psychological safety comes from knowing you can express your true self while working. You can pose a question that you’re afraid will make you sound foolish. You can own up to your errors without worrying about punishment or humiliation. You can share an incomplete concept without concern because your workmates will remain open-minded and supportive. You’ll experience a sense of belonging along with the security needed to take joint risks.Without psychological safety, team members shut themselves off, and they opt for caution—concealing our errors as innovation comes to a stop.In addition to psychological safety, Project Aristotle zeroed in on four other key dynamics that lead to team success: DependabilityKnowing your teammates will pull their weight, reliably completing high-quality work on time. Structure and clarityTeams are given clear roles, plans, and goals. MeaningTeam members feel the work they do is personally important to them. ImpactPeople believe their work matters and that it helps create change. The power of trust in top-performing teamsProject Aristotle confirmed what people often experience firsthand: A group of brilliant individuals will fail to reach its potential if they lack mutual trust and do not feel comfortable expressing their opinions to each other.The impact was pretty immediate, shifting the conversation. Managers transitioned their focus from task delegation to developing trust and promoting open communication among team members. Businesses understood that listening abilities along with empathy and support functions were not simply soft skills but fundamental components for top-performing teams. It validated the human element of work.Today, Project Aristotle feels more relevant than ever. Building connection and safety within a team becomes challenging when remote work involves half of its members. Leaders and team members need to consciously put forth effort to ensure that all members feel heard and included even during remote interactions.Project Aristotle’s enduring legacy is its simple but profound reminder: Businesses are powered by people. Team success depends on talent together with trust and respect alongside the freedom for members to show vulnerability. The research revealed that the foundation of a strong team is creating an environment where everyone feels secure and treated as a human.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The super early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
