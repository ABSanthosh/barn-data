With the wrong web host, you’ll end up paying for more than bad service. A reputable web host keeps your site online and helps you avoid unnecessary downtime, poor performance, or other problems that can hurt your website’s health in many ways. The main thing I care most about though is that the web host doesn’t cause me problems. The UI should be simple enough that I can get my website installed quickly. After that, I don’t want to hear from the hosting company until the next billing notification. A great web host runs my website and stays out of the way unless I need them. The other thing that matters is price. I’m personally less sensitive to others but after talking to hundreds of people about their websites and seeing what plans that people actually buy, pricing REALLY matters. Makes sense, who wants to spend more money than they have to on a brand new project? So yes, get the price down and don’t overpay for hosting on a brand new website. Whether you’re setting up your first website or adding to an existing portfolio, all of my top picks below will give you all the tools you need to run your website successfully. The Top 7 Best Web Hosts for 2025 Hostinger – Best overall DreamHost – Best value for shared hosting SiteGround – Best for extra speed and security Bluehost – Best for new WordPress websites Scala Hosting – Best upgrade from shared hosting HostGator – Best for simple websites WP Engine – Best managed WordPress hosting All of the hosts above are well-rounded providers that make launching your next website a breeze.

The most popular option is the Premium Shared Hosting plan which costs $2.99 per month. This lets you create up to 100 websites and host 25,000 visitors.

The Premium Shared Hosting plan provides 100 GB SSD storage, which is enough for various website content. Should you need more space, upgrade to one of their VPS or cloud hosting plans. Hostinger uses its own control panel called hPanel. Thanks to the eye-catching and well-organized navigation icons, it’s user-friendly and easy to navigate.

SiteGround – Best for Extra Speed and Security SiteGround is built to deliver top-class speed and rock-solid security for WordPress hosting. Currently, it’s running a huge promotion. You can get 80% off all annual hosting plans and a free website transfer. It makes a good deal even better. Hosting on SiteGround means you won’t have to worry about speed or security at all. It starts with the technology the hosting is built upon. SiteGround utilizes Google Cloud to maintain swift and stable connections and SSD persistent data storage to ensure low latency. Of course, you’re not on the hook for any of this–you just have to sign up for SiteGround and launch your WordPress site–they’ll take care of the heavy lifting on the backend. SiteGround security is on constant alert. It runs server health checks every 0.5 seconds, and its AI-driven anti-bot system blocks between 500,000 and 2 million brute force attack attempts every hour. This combination of speed and security can work for most sites. But as one of WordPress’ recommended web hosts, SiteGround is particularly skilled at delivering this performance for WordPress sites and includes an extra layer of security just for those sites. Plus, all SiteGround plans—not just the WordPress hosting options—include one-click WordPress installation, the WP Starter site builder, easy-to-use interfaces, and auto-updates for both the WordPress platform and its plugins. For a limited time, you can receive up to 80% off all annual Site Ground hosting plans: StartUp: $2.99/month for one year, paid annually GrowBig: $4.99/month for one year, paid annually GoGeek: $7.99/month for one year, paid annually Keep in mind that each plan will renew at a higher rate after one year. SiteGround also gives you options at checkout to pay for a 24-month or 36-month term instead– and gives nice discounts on renewals longer than one year. Two-year renewals get a 20% discount on the base renewal rate, and three-year renewals get 30% off. So, in terms of long-term value, you’re still getting the best deal by capitalizing on their great intro rate for one year upfront. Altogether, SiteGround offers the best technology and services to host your site and keep it fast and safe for all visitors. Refer to our full SiteGround review for more information. Bluehost – Best for New WordPress Websites Bluehost is one of the most popular web hosting companies in the world, especially among people launching their WordPress websites. Bluehost is one of three hosts that is officially recommended by WordPress, and we agree. They offer great rates and a beginner-friendly platform that makes every aspect of running a WordPress website easy. You can certainly build other types of websites on Bluehost, but it is definitely set up to work best with WordPress. Most of the time Bluehost will walk you through a task the first time, like setting up a blog or email account on your site. If you get stuck or have a problem, Bluehost has 24/7 support by phone or live chat. The support number and live chat options are listed right on the site, so you can reach out for help within two clicks. Installing WordPress takes one click, as do hundreds of other apps available in Bluehost’s deep app marketplace. Bluehost also offers fantastic marketing tools, analytics, and SEO tools to track how well your website is ranking for specific keywords. This gives you a good idea of how you should optimize your site for the best search rankings. The Basic shared hosting plan is usually $9.99 per month, but there are major discounts if you are a new customer. If you sign up for three years and lock in the price, you can get it at $4.75 per month. Like other hosts, renewal pricing is higher than promotional pricing, so I recommend signing up for a longer contract to lock in the low price. If your site keeps growing and you want to upgrade, Bluehost gives you lots of options: managed WordPress hosting, VPS hosting, and dedicated hosting. When you are ready for more server power and control, you can grow and stick with the same provider. Bluehost is a very safe play for people who want to build their site with WordPress. If you want to use another content management system besides WordPress, there will probably be a little extra legwork and backend maintenance. Try Bluehost today and test-drive their web hosting with a risk-free, 30-day, money-back guarantee. You can also check out our full Bluehost review for a closer look at this web hosting provider. Scala Hosting – Best Upgrade from Shared Hosting Maybe you’ve been running your website on shared hosting for a while and you’ve outgrown it. Or maybe you have an ambitious new website idea and you know the lower speed and security of shared hosting isn’t going to cut it. No matter your reason, Scala Hosting offers the best way to take the first step up from shared hosting into something more powerful and secure. While they offer an array of competitively priced shared hosting packages (starting at $2.95 per month), Scala’s Entry Cloud plan is a potent combination of server resources and premium features for boosting and fortifying the sites you host on it. First, you’re getting the dedicated resources that come with cloud hosting. No more worrying about how other sites that share server resources with yours are dragging down your site’s performance. You’re guaranteed two CPU cores for processing power and 2 GB of RAM that no one else is going to tap into on Scala’s cloud hosting. Entry Cloud also comes with the helpful features you’d expect from a step up from shared hosting. Scala provides 50 GB of NVMe storage space, which you can upgrade as needed. Simply pay a one-time fee to add anywhere from an extra 10 GB to a whopping 2 TB to your disk space. You also get one year of a custom domain for free, free SSL certificates, daily secure backups of your site data, and additional premium features such as: 24/7 SShield malware monitoring OpenLiteSpeed caching for faster site loading times Dedicated IP address Priority support from Scala Hosting Dedicated firewall Custom access role for site and hosting management It’s a really potent package that will set your site up for success. Scala’s Entry Cloud plan is faster, more reliable, and more secure than any form of shared hosting.  Best of all? It’s one of the most affordable cloud hosting plans you’ll find. Scala Hosting offers Entry Cloud for as little as $14.95 per month when you commit to a three-year term. That means you’ll lock in 36 months of upgraded hosting for just over $538 at checkout.  While that might be a lot to spend up front, consider that some of the other providers on our list charge between $30 per month to $100 per month for comparable plans. Don’t want to commit to three years? Entry Cloud’s rate rises for shorter terms, but not by too much. A one-year contract will lock in a rate of $19.95 per month while month-to-month billing will cost you $29.95. Another benefit of going for a longer term with Scala Hosting is that you save on the renewal rate as well. One-year and three-year terms renew at $24.95 per month, five dollars less than the base monthly rate. Stop playing in the shallows and get the upgrade your website needs to achieve success. Take the next step in web hosting by signing up for Scala Hosting’s Entry Cloud plan. HostGator – Best for Simple Websites HostGator offers all the hosting essentials you need at a great price, plus comes with a 45-day money-back guarantee. If you just need a standard business info website with products, services, “our story”, and so on, HostGator makes it as easy as possible. HostGator offers an extensive list of how-to guides for technical support. If you don’t find the answers you need, you can turn to phone, live chat, and email support. You can also purchase optional services like their SEO package, which is especially helpful for those who aren’t sure where to start to optimize their website. Unlike some hosts, HostGator does include support in all its plans. If you want a hosting plan that’s cheap and includes support, this is the host for you. If you want to get your hands dirty, there is a bit of a learning curve to taking advantage of their advanced options. HostGator does offer Windows hosting in addition to Linux, as well as a variety of options to upgrade, including cloud hosting, VPS hosting, managed WordPress, and a dedicated server. Shared hosting plans normally start at $2.75/month with a three-year contract. If you’re interested in trying HostGator, I recommend taking full advantage of the 45-day money-back guarantee and testing out their support thoroughly before committing. WP Engine – Best Managed WordPress Hosting WP Engine is one of the best (if not the best) WordPress hosts out there. Full stop. They provide a truly excellent product, that’s highly optimized for WordPress websites. If you want all the storage and speed you can get for your WP blog or online store, this is the host for you. It does come at a price though. A fully managed WordPress host is noticeably more expensive than shared hosting providers. WP Engine’s lowest-priced plan is $20/month, and that’s only for one 10GB site with max 25,000 visitors/month. You get two months free when you sign up for a year, however, and can get an even better deal signing up through Quicksprout. Yes, the price tag is higher than other hosts, but when you factor in what WP Engine does, it’s an incredibly appealing option for WordPress site owners. As a managed WordPress host, WP Engine only provides service to WordPress users, which means its entire infrastructure can be optimized for WordPress. Your site will be wicked fast, there’s virtually no downtime, and lots of maintenance tasks get taken care of automatically. It also offers special plans for people who are running an online store with WordPress. These are much more expensive than managed WordPress hosting, but you’ll get access to premium WordPress ecommerce themes and other tools that would cost hundreds of dollars sold separately. Customer support is also laser-focused on WordPress, which makes for highly competent knowledgeable support staff available through tracked tickets and on live chat 24/7. To see how WP Engine stacks up against the crowd, I recommend reading our complete WP Engine review. Bottom line: If you want a blazing-fast WordPress site where everything is taken care of automatically, you’ll want WP Engine. You’ll be paying more in order to get a lot more. Types of Web Hosting Not clear on the different kinds of web hosting available? Wondering who is the best in a given category? No matter which criteria is most important to you, be sure to read up to learn more about it all in the following posts. Understanding Different Types of Web Hosting Cheap Web Hosting Cloud Web Hosting Cpanel Hosting Dedicated Hosting Reseller Hosting Shared Hosting VPS Hosting WordPress Hosting How To Find the Best Host for You You do not have to know anything about web development to get hosting. But knowing how to assess a few key factors helps a lot. I’ll hit on each one in this section. You’ll be able to assess your options, get something that works for you, and not have to worry about hosting again for a while. So how do you evaluate web hosts? What actually matters? Let’s go through all the key items. Site Uptime Uptime is the most crucial component of a good web host. If your site isn’t up, you won’t make money or gain an audience. First and foremost, you want a web host with great uptime. This means your site is always available and never goes down. To try to avoid the “just trust us” promise of near-perfect uptime, most hosts provide some sort of guarantee of at least 99.9 percent uptime. However, that guarantee isn’t much of a guarantee. It just means your bill can be discounted in the event of any unplanned downtime. HostGator, for example, will credit you one free month of hosting if your uptime ever dips below 99.9%. There’s a lot of fine print on these guarantees, too, including not accepting self-reported or third-party uptime data, and not providing refunds for downtime that was out of the host’s control (for example, a hurricane). Site Speed Site speed impacts everything related to your site. Want search rankings? Get a fast site. Want conversions on your site? Make it fast. Want happy users? Speed it up. Every part of your business is impacted by the speed of your site. When looking at different web hosts, make sure you’re choosing a host that can serve every page lickety-split. There is some nuance with site speed. In the early days, you need a host that’s fast “enough.” It doesn’t have to be blisteringly fast, but it needs to be fast. Think of Amazon. Back in the day when Amazon just sold books, its site needed to be fast but it didn’t need to be instantaneous. But now that many people use it for all their shopping, Amazon’s site can’t be fast enough. In other words, the bigger you get, the faster you’ll want to be. If you’re planning on building a high-traffic site, you’ll want a host that can maintain crazy-fast speeds on large sites. Customer Support When running your own site, web host customer support is the single most important thing a web host can offer. Digging through use reviews doesn’t always give you a conclusive answer on the quality of support at a particular web host. Watch out for glowing reviews on top publications, they don’t always reflect reality. There is one true test for assessing the customer support quality at any host. The free trial customer support test. Pretty much every web host has some sort of money-back guarantee on their shared hosting plans, which means you can set up your website and see what you think of the service with relatively low stakes — just your time and any add-on fees you opt into, like paying for domain registration. I recommend going to town with customer support during that trial period. Get on live chat, open tickets, and hop on the phone as much as possible to see if you like what you’re being served up. Most web hosts offer some sort of free trial period. I recommend using this time to really dig into your host’s customer support — its knowledge center and especially support staff across all channels. That’ll tell you the real story. Traffic Volume The amount of traffic that you get has a huge impact on the hosting that you need. For a site that gets 300 visitors every month, pretty much any standard hosting package will be good enough. As long as your web host has strong customer support, you’re good to go. As you get bigger, all sorts of small details start to matter a lot more. Is the PHP on your server being updated regularly? Do you have a CDN for your content? Is your site being backed up daily and can you restore it within 15 minutes if something goes wrong? Do you have an SSL certificate? Can your server handle a giant traffic spike during a marketing promotion? Whenever I have a larger site, I look for premium hosting that takes care of all this for me. And if I’m planning on building a large site, I look for a host that can easily scale to millions of visitors per month. I’m happy to pay a premium price in order to guarantee easy upgrades in the future. Don’t skimp if you’re going big. Of course, not everyone has aspirations to go big. If that’s you and you plan to stay under 50,000 visitors/month, get a standard shared hosting package. It will simplify your life, trust me. There’s no reason to worry about the advanced stuff. Price While you don’t want to overpay on hosting, you definitely don’t want to underpay either. That being said, avoid choosing a host exclusively on price. Most basic web hosting plans are in the $10-$20/month range. Yes, there are cheaper options. Some of them are promotional offers that go away at renewals. Others are hosting plans with terrible support and uptime. My rule is if the price sounds too good to be true, it probably is. For example, you may find a very attractive introductory rate for just a few dollars per month and lock that price in for one or more years. However, when the time comes to renew your hosting, you will likely find the price will jump, sometimes by a lot. If you don’t like the renewal price you either have to live with it or change hosts. Changing hosting services can be a huge hassle, especially if you’re not tech savvy. You definitely do not want to be moving your sites every year or two, and that is what can happen if you start choosing a host based exclusively on price. I don’t worry about chasing promotional offers to save a few dollars. For every site I’ve ever managed, I used the same host without ever switching. Once you have a host you’re happy with, changing to save a few bucks isn’t going to be worth it. Promotional offers come and go pretty quickly. Migration Features The ability to easily and quickly migrate an existing site will save you weeks of time. Even a basic WordPress site can be a real hassle to migrate. First you have to set up a new WordPress install on your new host. Then you need to export the database of content from your old site and import it into your new one. Finally, you have to re-configure everything in WordPress like the theme, plugins, and settings. And if something doesn’t go quite as planned? You might be stuck with a website that doesn’t function. Fixing errors can sometimes take days, meaning your site is out of commission. Not something any website owner wants to see happen. Fortunately, it is possible to skip all these steps and mitigate your risks, too. Some hosts will offer a one-click migration for popular site builders like WordPress. If you’re switching hosts and handling the migration yourself, look for an easy migration feature. This is a great way to make the final decision on which hosting service is best for you, once you’ve narrowed it down to a few final options. Managed Hosting Here’s how a normal host works: After you sign up, you get a login. The login takes you to cPanel. The cPanel is an app on your server that lets you manage it through a UI without needing to know how to code anything. You configure your server however you want. There’s an FTP option to upload files manually to your server. There are also quick options for installing WordPress and other site software if you want. You get full access and can do anything you want. It’s a “choose your own adventure.” Install WordPress, Drupal, Magento, or code your entire site by hand. Alternatively, there are managed web hosts. These hosts customize the hosting environment and manage a lot more of it for you. WP Engine is the best example, they’re a managed host for WordPress. Instead of getting a cPanel login that lets me do anything I want, WP Engine gives me a login to their custom interface that’s built to manage WordPress sites specifically. When a web host is optimized exclusively for WordPress, three key things happen: Faster-performing sites than shared hosting. Everything can be tailored to make WordPress work its best, whether that’s optimizing website caching or tinkering with the command line tools. The host only needs to know how to support WordPress, as opposed to, say, Joomla and a Node server and some sort of custom-made site and on and on. More security and stability. A managed WordPress host can build a system that predicts, accommodates, and patches all of WordPress’s vulnerabilities. That means fewer malicious attacks and less downtime. Admin and site maintenance get a lot easier. And that service is vital because managed WordPress hosting is significantly more expensive than shared web hosting services. While I give up some flexibility from not having a basic web server like other hosts, a managed host takes care of a lot of ongoing tasks that I’d normally have to handle myself. If you have a small business site, a normal host is fine. If you’re building a larger site, a managed host will save you a ton of time in the long run and is worth the extra cost. Why I Recommend Hostinger for New and Small Websites For me, Hostinger ticks all the key boxes: Plans are super cheap. The lowest one starts at about $2.50/month for an initial 4 year promo period (then $8/month after that) The UI is super easy to use. I’ve never had a web host that was so intuitive and easy to use. It’s modern, fast, and everything is exactly where you’d expect it to be. Such a breath of fresh air compared to some other web hosts. In over a year, I haven’t had a single problem with my website. No downtime that I saw, no weird technical problems, no extra tasks that they forced me to do. Easy peasy all around. Their site migration tool is the single best site migration tool I’ve ever used. No joke. Within an hour, I created a brand new Hostinger account and got my old site completely transferred over. I thought to myself “damn that was easy, why didn’t I do this ages ago?” I haven’t contacted their support so I can’t speak to that. But I’m impressed that I haven’t had to contact their support in the first place. Great companies don’t force you to get on the phone, stuff should just work out of the box. That’s exactly what I’ve gotten from Hostinger. I like Hostinger a lot but there here are a few downsides you should be aware of: Monthly billing is more expensive. A monthly option brings the price up to $12/month with a $5 setup fee. If cash is tight enough that you can only afford a maximum payment of $5-10/month and can’t pay for multiple years at once, get a different web host. To get the lowest pricing at Hostinger, you have to drop about $120 in a single payment. This is what I did. Your payments will go up substantially after the initial promo period. If you pay for 4 years at $2.50/month, you’ll then start paying $8/month after that initial 4 year period. Most of the web hosts do stuff like this, I consider it a wash. Just be aware of it. Honestly, that’s it. I can’t think of anything else that’s bothered me since I’ve been a customer. And I can’t think of anything else that would bother you either. If you’re good with Hostinger’s payment terms, it really is the best web host out there for new and small websites. If I started a new website today, I’d gladly use Hostinger for it. I wouldn’t even shop around. The only exception would be if I was going big on the website from day one. In which case, I’d use WP Engine. Why I Recommend WP Engine for Growing Businesses My favorite web host for larger and established websites is WP Engine. But their plans start at $20/month. After spending years reviewing web hosting and helping small businesses get started with their websites, I’ve realized that it’s just too expensive for what most folks want and need. I know this is a dealbreaker for most folks. That said, here’s why I love it: The whole company is run by professionals. Everyone that I’ve ever interacted with at WP Engine has been on top of their game. They know what they’re doing. These are the types of companies that I prefer to do business with. In all the years I’ve used them, I’ve never had a site go down. To be clear, I did have sites go down, but it was never their fault. It always turned out to be some rogue plugin. Even though it’s never their fault, their team has helped me identify the problem more times than I can remember. They have all the advanced features I could ever want. Staging servers, advanced admin for multiple sites and user levels, automated security monitoring, they got it all. I’m sure I don’t even use 5% of what they’re capable of. Working with their support team has been flawless. A few times, we had to migrate between different server environments. They handled everything for us. And I don’t think I’ve ever seen such a well coordinated and well communicated transition from a support team before. I was blown away. For my 7-figure websites, I only trust WP Engine. Downsides? Like I said, there’s only one: the price. It takes $20/month to even get through the door. And your bills will go up substantially as your site grows. I don’t personally bat an eye, I know that I’m paying for security, peace of mind, and a team of professionals that can take care of problems when they do arise. But if you need to watch every penny for your website, WP Engine is a stretch.

No more worrying about how other sites that share server resources with yours are dragging down your site’s performance. You’re guaranteed two CPU cores for processing power and 2 GB of RAM that no one else is going to tap into on Scala’s cloud hosting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEntry Cloud also comes with the helpful features you’d expect from a step up from shared hosting.

You’ll be able to assess your options, get something that works for you, and not have to worry about hosting again for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo how do you evaluate web hosts? What actually matters?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s go through all the key items.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"site-uptime\"\u003eSite Uptime\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUptime is the most crucial component of a good web host.

This means your site is always available and never goes down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo try to avoid the “just trust us” promise of near-perfect uptime, most hosts provide some sort of guarantee of at least 99.9 percent uptime. However, that guarantee isn’t much of a guarantee. It just means your bill can be discounted in the event of any unplanned downtime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHostGator, for example, will credit you one free month of hosting if your uptime ever dips below 99.9%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a lot of fine print on these guarantees, too, including not accepting self-reported or third-party uptime data, and not providing refunds for downtime that was out of the host’s control (for example, a hurricane).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"site-speed\"\u003eSite Speed\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSite speed impacts everything related to your site.

Back in the day when Amazon just sold books, its site needed to be fast but it didn’t need to be instantaneous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut now that many people use it for all their shopping, Amazon’s site can’t be fast enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, the bigger you get, the faster you’ll want to be.

Get on live chat, open tickets, and hop on the phone as much as possible to see if you like what you’re being served up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost web hosts offer some sort of free trial period. I recommend using this time to really dig into your host’s customer support — its knowledge center and especially support staff across all channels.

As long as your web host has strong customer support, you’re good to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs you get bigger, all sorts of small details start to matter a lot more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIs the PHP on your server being updated regularly?

Can your server handle a giant traffic spike during a marketing promotion?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhenever I have a larger site, I look for premium hosting that takes care of all this for me. And if I’m planning on building a large site, I look for a host that can easily scale to millions of visitors per month. I’m happy to pay a premium price in order to guarantee easy upgrades in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t skimp if you’re going big. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, not everyone has aspirations to go big. If that’s you and you plan to stay under 50,000 visitors/month, get a standard shared hosting package. It will simplify your life, trust me. There’s no reason to worry about the advanced stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"price\"\u003ePrice\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile you don’t want to overpay on hosting, you definitely don’t want to underpay either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, avoid choosing a host exclusively on price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost basic web hosting plans are in the $10-$20/month range. Yes, there are cheaper options. Some of them are promotional offers that go away at renewals. Others are hosting plans with terrible support and uptime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy rule is if the price sounds too good to be true, it probably is. For example, you may find a very attractive introductory rate for just a few dollars per month and lock that price in for one or more years. However, when the time comes to renew your hosting, you will likely find the price will jump, sometimes by a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you don’t like the renewal price you either have to live with it or change hosts. Changing hosting services can be a huge hassle, especially if you’re not tech savvy. You definitely do not want to be moving your sites every year or two, and that is what can happen if you start choosing a host based exclusively on price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t worry about chasing promotional offers to save a few dollars. For every site I’ve ever managed, I used the same host without ever switching. Once you have a host you’re happy with, changing to save a few bucks isn’t going to be worth it. Promotional offers come and go pretty quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"migration-features\"\u003eMigration Features\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ability to easily and quickly migrate an existing site will save you weeks of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven a basic WordPress site can be a real hassle to migrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirst you have to set up a new WordPress install on your new host. Then you need to export the database of content from your old site and import it into your new one. Finally, you have to re-configure everything in WordPress like the theme, plugins, and settings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if something doesn’t go quite as planned? You might be stuck with a website that doesn’t function. Fixing errors can sometimes take days, meaning your site is out of commission. Not something any website owner wants to see happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, it is possible to skip all these steps and mitigate your risks, too. Some hosts will offer a one-click migration for popular site builders like WordPress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re switching hosts and handling the migration yourself, look for an easy migration feature. This is a great way to make the final decision on which hosting service is best for you, once you’ve narrowed it down to a few final options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"managed-hosting\"\u003eManaged Hosting\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere’s how a normal host works:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAfter you sign up, you get a login.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eThe login takes you to cPanel.
