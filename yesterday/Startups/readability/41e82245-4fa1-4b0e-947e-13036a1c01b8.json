  "text": "Google has accidentally revealed the existence of an AI-powered program capable of taking over a user’s computer in order to complete everyday, web-based tasks. The program, referred to as a “computer-using agent,” is named Jarvis.  In October, The Information reported that Google was deep in development on an AI program named Project Jarvis that could take over a computer in order to accomplish tasks like purchasing a product, making reservations, and gathering research. At the time, the publication reported that Google had planned to preview the Jarvis AI in December, along with the next generation of Gemini, its family of large language models. But according to Engadget, on November 6 Google accidentally uploaded an early version of Jarvis to the Google Chrome Web Store, where it could be downloaded as an extension. Those who downloaded the extension found that it wouldn’t actually work because of permissions issues, and within a few hours the store page had been scrubbed from the internet.  Google’s move into AI systems that can take over a computer for simple tasks represents a shot in the direction of Anthropic, which in late October announced that it had upgraded its all-purpose model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, with a new feature called “computer use.” Like Jarvis, computer use enables Claude to “use computers the way people do—by looking at a screen, moving a cursor, clicking buttons, and typing text.” Such a feature could enable users to simply ask an AI agent to buy concert tickets, make restaurant reservations as soon as new slots open, or search through folders to find specific files.",
