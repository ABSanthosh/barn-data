  "text": "OpenAI has announced new updates to ChatGPT that will enable the AI platform to give better, more substantial shopping recommendations. The company also announced the addition of autocomplete and trending questions to ChatGPT. In a post on X, OpenAI wrote that ChatGPT will now provide more information when recommending certain products. An OpenAI spokesperson told Inc. that the recommendations will appear for products in categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics. In an example shared with The Verge, OpenAI asked ChatGPT to search for the “best espresso machines under $200 that are great for making lattes and nice for small counter space.” ChatGPT responded by creating three product cards, each of which was labeled with a photo of the product, the product’s name, its price, links to websites where you can buy the product, and helpful labels like “best budget choice” or “versatile design.” According to media reports, OpenAI’s recommendations aren’t sponsored, and there’s no way to pay OpenAI to recommend your specific product. OpenAI search product lead Adam Fry told Wired that reviews will play a heavy factor in ChatGPT’s recommendations, and reviews will be pulled from both media organizations and social media platforms. TechCrunch also confirmed that OpenAI won’t make any money through affiliate product referrals. OpenAI also announced that ChatGPT will now show a list of the day’s top trending searches, and like Google, will attempt to auto-complete queries as you’re writing them. The new update also brings improvements to citations, meaning ChatGPT can include multiple citations to back up its answers. OpenAI first introduced web-search abilities to ChatGPT in October. These abilities enable ChatGPT to accomplish a large variety of tasks, from making product recommendations to  analyzing up-to-date information. More recently, OpenAI released Operator, a new feature that enables ChatGPT to actually use an internet browser. The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, May 2, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
