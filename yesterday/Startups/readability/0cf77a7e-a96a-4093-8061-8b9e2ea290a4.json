  "text": "On Saturday, Elon Musk sent an email to federal employees asking them to respond with a summary of what they accomplished in the past week. “Please reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished this week and cc your manager,” the message said. Later, on X, the social platform he owns, Musk said that failure to respond would be treated as a resignation.There is so much going on in that paragraph that I’m not qualified to address. For example, is it even legal to force federal employees to send a weekly email or lose their jobs? Is it legal just because Musk, who is a “Special Government Employee,” posts it on X? Oh, and who is even going to read them all?The answers to the first two questions will presumably be decided by courts if anyone is actually fired and decides to sue. As for the last question, I’m not sure it even matters.The move is similar to what Musk did after taking over Twitter in 2022, when he instituted “code reviews,” where he required engineers to send in the code they wrote in a given week and he would decide who was up to the challenge of changing X.It does not seem reasonable that Musk—who currently leads at least five companies, as well as new government pseudo-agency—is reviewing emails from more than a million federal workers. Also, it’s an incredibly inefficient way to measure productivity.Look, this is a perfect example of how more than one thing can be true at the same time. It’s almost certainly true that there are people working for the federal government who aren’t very good at their job, or who aren’t very productive. The law of large numbers means there is no question about that. It’s probably worth having a conversation about whether we should keep them all on the payroll at the expense of the taxpayers.Not only that, but it is undoubtedly true that, if you believe the federal government needs massive change, this is probably the only way that is ever going to happen. There is simply too much inertia in an organization the size of the federal government.Effecting the kind of change that Musk and President Trump want to make would be impossible by enacting laws, or even through executive orders. Too many people would simply keep doing what they are doing. Their strategy is to start blowing things up and deal with the fallout. Musk is approaching the problem with the tech-founder “move fast and break things” method of leadership.However, even if all of that is true, this is a poor way to accomplish that goal. You simply cannot micromanage the Federal government into whatever form Musk is hoping it will become.Then again, I’m not sure it’s about productivity or reshaping the government at all. I don’t think this about federal employees justifying how they spend their time. Instead it’s about creating a fear of losing their jobs.Fear, by the way, is an incredibly effective way to lead. People will often go to extraordinary efforts to avoid whatever it is they fear. It make them afraid that their job is at stake, they will definitely try to make you not want to fire them.That isn’t the same as making them more productive, by the way. Musk isn’t making Federal employees work harder or better, he’s just making them wish they worked somewhere where they were valued for their service. Maybe that’s part of the point.Musk, after all, is trying to eliminate the jobs of as many federal employees as possible. Perhaps he’s decided to just make working for the government as miserable as possible. Maybe he’ll succeed, but that doesn’t make him a good leader. In fact, I think you can argue that micromanaging your employees into fear for their jobs is the one thing no leader should ever do.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The application deadline for Inc.'s Best Workplaces Awards is Friday, March 7, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
