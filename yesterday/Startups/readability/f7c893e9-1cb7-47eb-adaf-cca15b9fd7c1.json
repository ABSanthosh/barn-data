  "text": "Despite workplace changes since the wake of Covid, meetings continue to function as essential places for collaboration and decision-making in businesses. This is true whether your meetings are in person or virtual via Zoom, Teams, or some other videoconferencing platform.  My second book, Better Business Meetings, is about how the basics of meetings haven’t changed much in the years since. One thing I discovered is if you’re not careful, engaging in bad meeting behaviors can at best make you look unprofessional. At worst, it can do permanent damage to your reputation and trustworthiness in the workplace. The following seven behaviors can make you look unprofessional during meetings, so be particularly careful to avoid them. 1. Chronic tardiness When you consistently show up late to meetings, you demonstrate a lack of respect for other participants’ time. I personally hate it when the meeting leader—a manager or executive—is the one who chronically shows up late. Whether you’re a meeting leader or a participant, be sure to show up on time. When unavoidable delays prevent you from arriving on time, send participants an immediate notification. This way they don’t sit around twiddling their thumbs as they await your arrival. 2. Multitasking during discussions When you check emails, send text messages, or scroll through your social media during meetings, you demonstrate through your actions that you are not fully committed to the discussion. When you divide your attention between multiple tasks, you reduce your meaningful contributions and show disrespect to both presenters and other attendees. Minimize distractions by turning off notifications and putting your smartphone face down on the table so you can focus fully on your current task. 3. Poor preparation Being unable to answer fundamental questions about the meeting’s topics demonstrates a serious lack of professionalism and quickly shows everyone that you haven’t prepared properly. Not reviewing pre-meeting materials and not looking through the agenda in advance—while failing to prepare your own inputs—leads to wasted time. Make sure to review essential documents. Keep your main questions and solutions in mind before you show up for the meeting. 4. Dominating the conversation Repeatedly taking control of discussions, interrupting others, or redirecting conversations to personal agendas shows inadequate emotional intelligence. It also shows a lack of teamwork abilities. Effective meetings require balanced participation from everyone, not just a select few. Focus on active listening during discussions while asking questions that help move the agenda forward. Be sure to monitor your speaking time to avoid dominating the discussion. 5. Avoiding accountability Your professional reputation suffers when you avoid accountability, make excuses, or do not deliver on your commitments. Make sure you fully grasp both the expectations and the deadlines before accepting action items. When situations change, make sure to communicate any obstacles immediately. Don’t wait for the next meeting to explain unfinished work. 6. Inappropriate phone behavior No one likes it when meeting participants are constantly playing with their smartphones during meetings. You undermine meetings by failing to silence your phone and by taking calls during discussions. You also distract other participants with visible phone notifications. The solution is simple: Set your phone to silent mode. Keep it hidden unless you have a crucial call to receive. If that’s the case, then be sure to inform meeting participants in advance. 7. Negative body language Research shows that nonverbal communication conveys more information to others than actual spoken words. When you slouch, avoid eye contact, fidget excessively, or roll your eyes, you undermine your input. This gives off signals of disengagement or disrespect. Demonstrate positive body language by maintaining an upright posture. Show engagement through direct eye contact and use responsive facial expressions. Nod to show you understand what other participants are saying. The way you conduct yourself during meetings shapes colleagues’ opinions of you. The opinions about your professional ability and trustworthiness stay with you long after the meetings are over. When you avoid negative meeting behaviors, you establish yourself as someone who respects both time and contributions from others. Ultimately, you’ll look professional instead of unprofessional.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The preferred-rate application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is this Friday, March 21, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
