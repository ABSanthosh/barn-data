Zillow forecasts that the area will be the hottest housing market this year because of its lower-than-average home prices and strong home value growth. Related: The 15 Best Places to Live in the U.S., Where Homes Are Cheaper, and There Are Lots of Jobs to Choose FromBuffalo also has the greatest number of new jobs per new homes permitted, which means it has the greatest expected demand for housing. New jobs translate to new residents who move into an area, increasing competition and home prices until builders can construct enough houses to meet demand. \"Construction that keeps pace with an area's growth remains a crucial piece of keeping homes available and accessible,\" Zillow's chief economist Skylar Olsen stated in a press release. \"In chilly Buffalo, competition among buyers will remain hot, with employment growing far faster than builders are adding homes.\"Zillow forecasted last year that Buffalo would be a hot market in 2024 and was correct. The area was a strong seller's market last year, according to Zillow's own market heat index.Related: A New Hampshire City Was Named the Hottest Housing Market in the U.S. This Year. Here's the Top 10 for 2024.Second on the list is Indianapolis, Indiana. With a typical home value of $275,639 in 2024, Indianapolis stands out in terms of affordability, which Zillow predicts will attract prospective home buyers this year. Third, fourth, and fifth on the list are Providence, Rhode Island; Hartford, Connecticut; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Zillow says these areas stand out as prime housing markets because of their relative affordability compared to the more expensive Northeastern areas they border, like New York and Boston.Here's a list of Zillow's predictions for the top 10 hottest housing markets in the U.S. in 2025, along with Zillow's estimates of the typical home value in 2024 and home value growth forecast for 2025 in those areas.1.
