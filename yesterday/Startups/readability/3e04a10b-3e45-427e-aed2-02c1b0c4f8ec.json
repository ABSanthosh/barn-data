  "text": "November 19, 2024 2:47 PM Xsolla today announced that it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the city of Busan in South Korea and the Busan Digital Asset Nexus Co. (BDAN) with plans to help build the city’s game development talent and workforce. Xsolla will establish its APAC headquarters in Busan, and work with BDAN to open a talent development center for game developers in the city. The three parties signed the Memorandum at Busan Metropolitan City Hall, with Busan Mayor Park Hyung-Joon and BDAN CEO Kim Sang-min pledging at the ceremony alongside Xsolla. The new HQ aims to expand employment for the area alongside collaboration with partners both local and international — Xsolla plans to make it “a hub for game commerce activities.” According to Xsolla, the proposed talent development center will be “an incubator and accelerator program to empower local game developers and entrepreneurs,” offering mentorship, resources and access to funding opportunities for fledgling game development talent. Rytis Joseph Jan, Xsolla’s SVP of Global Strategic Partnerships, said in a statement, “This partnership is a testament to Busan’s incredible potential as a center for gaming and technology. By collaborating with BDAN and Busan City, we aim to create opportunities for local talent and businesses while contributing to the economic and technological growth of the region.” As part of its collaboration, BDAN and Xsolla will also explore new web3 technology. BDAN CEO Kim added in a separate statement, “The vision we discussed with Xsolla earlier this year is becoming a reality. Together, we will help Busan become a digital finance hub and a global blockchain city, fostering new opportunities in gaming and beyond. BDAN is committed to fulfilling its social responsibilities by leading the digital industry and urban innovation in Busan.” GB Daily Stay in the know!
