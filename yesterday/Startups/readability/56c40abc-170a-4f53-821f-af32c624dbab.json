The most crucial lesson entrepreneurs can learn from their stories is the power of crafting a clear vision—a mental picture of what you want to do and who you want to be.Steve Jobs’s vision was to create beautifully designed, user-friendly computers. Jeff Bezos’s vision was to create an everything store where customers could find and buy anything they wanted online. Swift’s vision also filled a gap and proved to be revolutionary: She would write her own songs for girls like her, an audience of her peers. Swift also faced the same problem many innovators do: Her vision defied conventional wisdom.“Most artists don’t write their own songs. They rely on professional, often older, songwriters,” Evers told me. “And the gatekeepers for country music radio at the time didn’t believe there was an audience for teenage girls.”You might not be trying to break into the music scene. However, if you have ideas that upend conventional wisdom, crafting a vivid vision of what you want to accomplish has three powerful benefits that’ll give you energy, clarity, and confidence.1. Vision pulls you forward.By writing songs for a teenage audience, Swift was following a classic blue ocean strategy. The strategy, well-known in the startup world, means aiming to tap an uncontested market.“It’s straight out of an entrepreneur’s playbook. She seized an opportunity that other people were ignoring,” Evers writes. “The hyper specificity of that vision is what really enabled her to push through.”Starting a business requires an enormous amount of energy because you’re doing it all, from marketing and sales to fundraising and operations. Launching a company takes massive effort, but once in orbit, the gravitational pull of your vision will make it easier to put in the work.In his 2023 book Be Useful: Seven Tools for Life, Arnold Schwarzenegger says, “Everything starts with vision,” because it makes the hard work easier. For example, with every rep in the gym, Schwarzenegger saw himself on a stage winning a bodybuilding trophy. It fueled his drive. Like a North Star, a clear vision doesn’t just guide you. It pulls you forward and gives you the energy to turn dreams into reality.2. Vision sharpens your decisions.  A clear vision makes decision making easier. Taylor Swift made the decision to walk away from a development deal with a major Nashville music label because they weren’t committed to her vision. Swift’s relentless pursuit of her vision eventually caught the ear of a music producer who also had a reputation of being a maverick. Together, they made history.Innovators with a clear mental picture can make more deliberate decisions because their vision allows them to “shut out the noise and opinions of fans and media and listen to their own well-calibrated, internal compass,” writes Evers.Swift would need that compass because, like many innovators, she was trying to accomplish something that hadn’t been done before. And the resistance she’d encounter would be brutal.3. Vision shields you from critics.If you have a novel idea, a clear vision will act as a shield against the arrows of critics, skeptics, and naysayers. Armed with Excel spreadsheets, music industry executives dismissed Taylor Swift’s vision because she was trying to write songs for an audience that, according to data, didn’t exist. Swift, however, was relentless. According to Evers, “Swift’s vision really propelled her through hardships, challenges, and the negativity and skepticism that was coming her way.” When you try something new, you’ll meet plenty of people who will gladly tell you why it can’t be done. But, like Swift, a strong enough vision will help you to ignore the naysayers and build the confidence you’ll need to silence the critics. Doing anything new requires bucking the status quo. Since most people are content with the way things are, being an entrepreneur means you’ll meet with resistance from every direction. The one thing that will pull you through is the strength of your vision and your commitment to making it real.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",
