  "link": "",
  "description": "After 16 years as Editor-in-Chief of Harvard Business Review, Adi Ignatius is handing the role over to a new leader, and he joins Rapid Response for a more-than-an-exit interview. A longtime friend and colleague of host Bob Safian, Ignatius shares some of the most critical lessons he’s learned in decades of covering business and leadership, as well as dissecting the most hot button issues today — from Elon Musk’s conflicting priorities, to AI’s impact on media, and what Americans most misunderstand about China. Plus, Ignatius takes us inside Harvard’s response to Trump’s attacks, and why such stories are leaving business leaders in fear of speaking out against the government. Visit the Rapid Response website here: https://www.rapidresponseshow.com/See Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
