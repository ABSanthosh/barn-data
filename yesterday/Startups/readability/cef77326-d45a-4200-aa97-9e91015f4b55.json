  "text": "When Sinclair Toffa was growing up, getting birthday money from his French grandmother meant trips to Western Union. “That was always a pain because the fees back then were incredibly high,” he says. That’s why today, Toffa runs Mural Pay, a cross-border payment facilitation platform that can help businesses make payments more quickly than many traditional methods he says. This is especially important for businesses that, say, have vendors across the globe. Aside from high fees, it can get very complicated for a business to make international payments, as Toffa dealt with when he worked at Palantir with an auto manufacturer that shipped parts around the world. One of many issues was an elaborate supply chain, from dealerships to manufacturers to suppliers, as well as coordinating shipping thousands of car parts and payment. “As you can imagine, there is just tremendous payment complexity that arises,” he says.  “Thousands of payments go out every month, payments might bounce back or get delayed without clear reason, reconciliation becomes complex, [and then there are] high fees along the way,” he adds.On a podcast published in January, Toffa said a Rumi quote inspired him to try and build a company of his own. “Set your life on fire. Seek those who fan your flames,” was his burning bush. He left Palantir in April 2021 and spent 8 months trying to decide what kind of business to create before launching Mural in Mural, of course, isn’t the first or only company to facilitate cross-border payments. The company Wise is a well-known world payment service for businesses. And, from the average person’s perspective, to way oversimplify, there’s also PayPal, wire transfers, or solutions like Remitly for online remittance payments (i.e., people sending money back home). And The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) is a core system that member banks use for sending and communicating about international payments. But Mural claims it has the advantage of speed and lower fees than its competitors. Its secret? Blockchain. Blockchain technology functions as the recordkeeper of cryptocurrency. It details transactions for transparency and consistency, but it can be used for any industry. It’s decentralized, so it isn’t owned by a government or corporation.And in fact, Mural started out as a crypto company. They raised $5.6 million in 2022 to iterate and build infrastructure for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and other types of crypto companies. DAOs are non-hierarchical organizations that often utilize crypto-related infrastructure and products, but it’s a pretty large category. An illustrative example is Uniswap, a crypto exchange where anyone can vote on how the marketplace is run if they buy the token.But Mural, which has raised $8 million to date, ended up scrapping that narrower crypto focus. “The crypto native market is too small,” Toffa says, and they realized, “that there’s actually greater pain points [for] existing businesses.” Starting in January 2023, Mural began to leverage the technology for businesses and make complex payments around the world faster. Now, the word “cryptocurrency” is banned internally, he says, even though Mural still uses crypto—stablecoins—to power its quick-transfer network and minimize costs. Toffa says Mural uses stablecoins—cryptocurrencies with the least volatility—pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by the U.S. Treasury, including PYUSD and USDC.  To describe Mural in its current form, Toffa offered the metaphor of mycelium—the mushroom networks that trees use to communicate. It’s an apt descriptor in the sense that Mural is a facilitator, connecting networks to other networks to give companies tools to pay people and businesses with less friction. Right now, it takes them seven minutes for Mural to send money from the U.S. to Argentina, and two minutes to send money from the U.S. to Europe. He says both will eventually come down to seconds.A huge part of the company’s client base is importers and exporters, he says—those who are the most likely to be caught up in global financial rigamarole. Some examples: Lentil, bean, and grain exporters who need to pay distributors, vendors, and suppliers—and need to change money from Mexican Pesos to Colombian pesos from dollars. There’s also Norway-based Opera.com, a web browser that pays over 2,500 of its Opera News contractors a month with Mural Pay, Toffa says. As for what’s next? In the future, Toffa thinks AI will help automate financial transactions to a greater degree, (as do others) which will increase the speed of customer support, compliance, reconciliation, etc, across the space, on top of what it’s already doing in the company.“I think we’re going to see a pretty exciting convergence of [AI] and payments… “We’re going to move to real-time payments across the board,” he says. The application deadline for Inc.'s Best Workplaces Awards is Friday, March 7, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
