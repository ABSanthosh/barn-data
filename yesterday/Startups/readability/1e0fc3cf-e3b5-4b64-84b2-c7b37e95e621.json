While my new book, Give First: The Power of Mentorship, is part of the content (and a giveaway that I’ll be signing at some of the events), I’m planning on staying around, talking to whomever is there, and just enjoying a month of the Boulder and Denver startup communities.The following is what is currently scheduled. I expect there will be a few more things.5/12 @ 8am: 2025 Boulder Startup Week: Welcome Breakfast and Kickoff to Boulder Startup Week: There will be lots of socializing as Boulder Startup Week gets started. Join me for breakfast and a short talk on the roof of Rosetta Hall. The rumor is that the weather is going to be awesome.5/13 @ 3pm: 2025 Boulder Startup Week: Startup Communities – The Next Generation: My partner Jaclyn Hester and I will have a fireside chat about the evolution of a startup community. We’ll talk about the importance of existing leaders (e.g. me) to hand off the torch to the next generation (e.g. Jaclyn), why the development of the startup community is not a straight line up and to the right, and how to incorporate concepts from my upcoming book Give First: The Power of Mentorship into your daily activities in the startup community.5/16 @ 10am: 2025 Boulder Startup Week: Building and Managing Your Board: I’ve been on a zillion boards. This panel includes several people with whom I’ve been on great boards (Tim Miller, Todd Vernon), along with Walter Knapp (my partner Seth is on his board). I’m also been on a lot of mediocre boards and several crappy ones, so I’ll bring those experiences to the discussion also.5/28 @ 11am – 6pm: Random Day at Composition Shop: I’ll spend the day at Greeley Sachs’ new bookstore in Longmont doing a Random Day (where I have 15-minute meetings with anyone who wants to meet). Look for a separate post with an online calendar to reserve spots soon.5/29 @ 2pm: 2025 Conscious Entrepreneur Summit: I’ll share my perspective on mentorship, community, and how Give First applies not just to business but also to the way we live and lead.6/5 @ 5pm: Techstars Workforce Development Demo Day featuring a Book Launch with Brad Feld: I used to go to every Techstars Demo Day. I think this might be the first one I’m going to post-COVID, and I’m excited to experience its energy.",
