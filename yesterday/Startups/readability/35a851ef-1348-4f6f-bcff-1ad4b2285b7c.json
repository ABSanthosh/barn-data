They are responsible for ensuring staff have what they need to do their jobs and providing feedback on how well they’re doing their jobs. Here’s another one to add to the list: promoting effective communication skills. When technical staff members communicate effectively, they not just performing their technical roles; they’re also contributing to long-term business growth and company success. Here are three reasons why technical leaders should care about their team’s communication skills. Improve collaboration.When I worked as a product development engineer developing medical devices, most of my work involved working in project teams. Many of my team members did not have technical backgrounds. Early on, there were instances when my inability to convey what I was doing for a project negatively affected what other team members needed to do for the project. This caused project delays, which occasionally led to missed opportunities such as launching a product at a key tradeshow. Growing in communication with the team led to fewer misunderstandings and missed deadlines. Technical leaders who care about their staff’s communication skills will ensure that staff are adept at communicating technical details to non-technical team members. This lessens disruption in project execution and drives better alignment between technical and business objectives. Better communication equals fewer screwups. Boost innovation pipelines.Once, I worked in a group that was new to the company. The group was responsible for coming up with strategies and ideas to better compete with other companies. As a member of this group, I routinely presented new product ideas to C-level executives. After a few of these presentations, leaders eventually cancelled the first major product I worked on. Quickly after that, my boss realized it was in his interest to ensure that I was able to convey ideas well enough for them to be approved. He suggested that I attend Toastmasters, a program that helps people improve their public speaking skills and their communication skills. Technical leaders who care about their staff’s communication skills understand this truth. Clear communication with decision makers improves the likelihood of buy-in for innovative solutions. It’s simple: better communication skills, more green-lit projects. Increase industry influence.Once products get approved, developed, and ultimately launched as products, it’s time to market and sell them. After I developed my communication skills, leaders sent me to give oral presentations at conferences and staff exhibitor booths. Improving my communication skills increased the likelihood that potential partners would ask for more information at the booth and after presentations, instead of the alternative – just moving along after speaking with me. Technical leaders don’t want technical staff who are incapable of talking about the company’s products to potential customers. This is especially true if they want to know more about the technical nature of the products. Technical leaders who care about their team’s communication skills want staff members who can represent the organization well, enhancing the company’s reputation and credibility in the industry. Better speakers are better salespeople.  This is just the tip of the iceberg of why technical leaders should want their teams to be skilled communicators. Just being technically skilled isn’t enough. If the technical staff can’t effectively communicate with others, the business suffers and the technical leaders look bad. Investing in communication skills ensures that technical teams don’t just build great solutions. Instead, those solutions get recognized, implemented, and valued, driving both individual and organizational success.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
