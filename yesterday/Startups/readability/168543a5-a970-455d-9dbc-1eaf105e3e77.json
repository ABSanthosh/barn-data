Hosted by investor Alexa von Tobel, each weekly conversation digs into a founder’s professional playbook to reveal what makes them tick. Listen to episodes here.  How to Grow From Idea to IPO, With Eliot Horowitz of MongoDB and Viam When Eliot Horowitz, founder and CEO of Viam, was locked down with his family during Covid, he did what any engineer might do—he built a robot to play chess. Once that project was complete, he turned his attention to his ever-problematic sprinkler system. After that, he added smart software to his HVAC system. Through this series of home improvements, Horowitz uncovered a problem he was eager to solve—automating the physical world—and his third startup, Viam, was born. Viam connects hardware to software and unlocks AI, automation, and data for the physical world. A career software developer and technology leader, Horowitz previously co-founded developer database company MongoDB, which went public in 2017 and has a market cap of over $20 billion. Horowitz shares why he enforces a no-jerk policy when it comes to hiring, how he evolved as a founder from the seed stage to post-IPO, and why he believes that being the product’s biggest user is essential to success.
