  "text": "I’ve seen many entrepreneurs work tirelessly to get their company off the ground only to sabotage progress through a few avoidable behaviors. Most of the time, they don’t even realize the damage they’re causing. I once coached a business owner who seemed unstoppable. She’d rapidly expanded her company, boosted revenues, and brought on promising new hires. However, behind the scenes, her unpredictable management style was turning that success into a ticking time bomb.My client was a hard worker and made brilliant strategic moves. Yet she couldn’t see how her late-night demands and emotional outbursts were eroding trust. Employees who were once excited to help the company grow felt constantly on edge. Some of her best performers started making quiet plans to leave. As you might guess, when key people walk out the door, momentum suffers—projects stall, morale sinks, and clients sense something is off.That’s the central pattern I’ve noticed: When owners create a stressful or chaotic environment, even unintentionally, they sabotage their own vision. Here are three common destructive behaviors I’ve encountered and the steps to reverse them.Unpredictable leadershipIf you’re chronically late to meetings or frequently change priorities, then your team never knows what to expect. This causes confusion, missed deadlines, and blame-shifting. The fix is consistency. Show up on time, set realistic deadlines, and clarify expectations. If you do need to pivot, explain the reasoning instead of just announcing a sudden shift. Consistent communication fosters a stable, proactive culture.Drama and emotional outburstsWe’re all human, but venting your anger or frustration at employees in the moment can have long-lasting effects. Clients have told me about times when they lost their cool, only to realize their staff began withholding problems rather than risk another blow-up. The solution is to manage your own emotional triggers. Take a breath, walk around the block, or schedule difficult conversations after you’ve calmed down. Leaders who model self-control cultivate loyal teams that feel safe innovating and bringing issues to light.Micromanagement and control issuesIt’s natural to feel protective of the company you worked so hard to build, but hovering over every decision can crush initiative. Employees resent constant scrutiny, and you’ll burn out trying to do everyone else’s job. Instead, define clear guidelines and boundaries. Let your team members know the goals, the quality standards, and any firm no-go areas. Then, trust them to execute without needing your input on every small detail. You can set regular check-ins or milestones, but step back enough for them to develop confidence and competence.By addressing these three pitfalls—unpredictable leadership, emotional outbursts, and micromanagement—you break the pattern of self-sabotage and preserve the success you’ve worked for. If you sense any of these issues might be creeping into your organization, start making small changes in how you communicate and delegate. Ask employees for candid feedback on your leadership style, and really listen to what they say. You’ll discover hidden stumbling blocks before they turn into a full-blown crisis.Your company culture should uplift rather than sabotage your business goals. Steady leadership, respectful interactions, and well-defined roles allow your team to do their best work—and let you focus on the strategic opportunities that fuel growth. By bringing your own behaviors into alignment with the success you want, you’ll keep your business—and yourself—on track for the long haul.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The super early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
