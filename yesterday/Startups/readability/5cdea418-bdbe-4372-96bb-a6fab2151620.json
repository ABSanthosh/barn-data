  "text": "At an event on Tuesday, Airbnb rolled out what is likely its biggest shift since its founder, Brian Chesky, blew up an air mattress and invited guests of a design conference to crash at his apartment in San Francisco almost two decades ago. Now, 17 years later, the company that redefined travel by letting people book homes from local hosts is transforming again—this time, by turning every trip (and even your own city) into a curated experience. During its announcement, Airbnb revealed an ambitious relaunch of its platform with three massive upgrades: Airbnb Services, a fully reimagined Airbnb Experiences, and an all-new app that brings it all together. “We used to just help you find a place to stay,” CEO Brian Chesky said during the event. “Now, you can Airbnb more than an Airbnb.” Here’s what’s new: Airbnb Services: room service, reimagined One of Airbnb’s biggest challenges is that while it can provide a better place to stay than the average hotel in any given city, those hotels often offer perks and services like room service or a gym. Now, Airbnb is now competing with hotels on their own turf—by offering in-home services like private chefs, massages, personal training sessions, and even makeup and hairstyling. Starting in 260 cities worldwide, travelers (and locals) can now book a variety of services through Airbnb without even needing to stay in an Airbnb home. For example, you can order a professionally prepared dinner by a Michelin-trained chef in your own kitchen—or have a celebrity makeup artist get you ready for an event. These offerings include 10 categories at launch, from spa treatments to family photography sessions. Each service provider is thoroughly vetted based on experience, certifications, and reputation, ensuring quality and consistency. Booking is as easy as choosing a date and time in the new app, and services are priced to be accessible—think $50 for a taco sampler or $75 for a personal training session with a former White House coach. All-new Experiences: see cities like a local Airbnb also relaunched its Experiences platform, rebuilt from the ground up to make it easier to see your favorite city in a whole new way. The goal is to ditch the cookie-cutter tourist traps and let travelers connect with locals who know their cities best. Instead of bus tours or crowded tourist traps, Airbnb Experiences offers five categories: history and culture, food and drink, nature and outdoors, art and design, and fitness and wellness. To be clear, these aren’t just basic walking tours. These experiences include visiting Notre Dame with one of the architects who helped restore it, or learning to make ramen from a Michelin-starred chef in Tokyo. Airbnb Originals Airbnb is also rolling out “Airbnb Originals”—premium, exclusive experiences hosted by notable figures like Megan Thee Stallion, Patrick Mahomes, and Doechii. These once-in-a-lifetime experiences are bookable in the app and come with countdown-style availability drops so fans can jump on bookings the moment they go live. Crucially, just like services, these experiences are available to locals too, not just travelers. A completely new Airbnb app To bring it all together, Airbnb has redesigned its app from scratch—both for guests and hosts. The new app features a refreshed home screen with vibrant visuals and personalized content. For example, before you travel, the app will give you a countdown to your trip. But, as your trip approaches, you’ll be given personalized suggestions for services or experiences near where you’re staying. If you book a home in Mexico City, the app will surface recommended chefs, photographers, or experiences nearby on your exact dates. Book a breakfast with a local chef or a Lucha Libre experience, and those items will populate your trip itinerary in real-time. The app also includes a new itinerary view that includes everything you’ve booked: home check-in times, scheduled services, and daily experiences. If you add an experience, it shows up right in line with the rest of your itinerary. One of the things Chesky pointed out on a number of occasions was the amount of attention the company paid to the smallest details. For example, the navigation tab icons (for Homes, Experiences, and Services) are interactive. When you click on the Homes icon, the door opens and the light comes on. Those might not seem like a big deal, but Airbnb is a design company as much as anything, and that’s super obvious the moment you open the app. It’s also not hard to see the impact Jony Ive, who serves as an advisor to the company, has had on the overall experience of using the app. After the trip, the app helps you maintain connections with the people you traveled with, and the people who were a part of your experiences. You can message other guests you met during an experience, share photos, and even keep in touch using the newly introduced Connections feature, which tracks everyone you’ve traveled or booked with. Chesky called this the “social network for the real world,” grounded not in scrolling, but in shared experiences and face-to-face connection. It’s worth noting that Airbnb just became as much a group messaging app as it is a place to book homes, experiences, or services. Of all the changes it announced today, this might be the most ambitious, as well as the thing that most radically changes the way you travel.
