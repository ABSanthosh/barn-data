Learn More Anthropic has introduced a web search capability for its Claude AI assistant, intensifying competition in the rapidly evolving AI search market where tech giants are racing to redefine how users find information online. The company announced today that developers can now enable Claude to access current web information through its API, allowing the AI assistant to conduct multiple progressive searches to compile comprehensive answers complete with source citations. The move comes as web search undergoes its most significant transformation since Google revolutionized the field more than two decades ago. “Developers can now augment Claude’s comprehensive knowledge with current, real-world data by enabling the web search tool when making requests to the Messages API,” Anthropic said in its announcement. The new capability arrives amid signs that traditional search is losing ground to AI-powered alternatives. Apple’s senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue, testified today in Google’s antitrust trial that searches in Safari fell last month for the first time in the browser’s 22-year history. “I’ve lost a lot of sleep thinking about it,” Cue said regarding potential revenue loss from Google’s estimated $20 billion payment to be Safari’s default search engine. Web search is now available on our API.Developers can augment Claude's comprehensive knowledge with up-to-date data. pic.twitter.com/pRQf0ZKXUZ— Anthropic (@AnthropicAI) May 7, 2025 AI assistants are eating Google’s lunch: The decline of traditional search engine dominance The data points to a seismic shift in information discovery patterns. SOCi’s Consumer Behavior Index shows that 19% of consumers already use AI for search, creating the first meaningful challenge to Google’s stranglehold on web information access in decades. This transformation stems from fundamental differences in how AI assistants process and present information. Unlike traditional search engines that display a list of links requiring users to sift through results, AI assistants synthesize information from multiple sources, delivering concise, contextual answers. This eliminates the cognitive load of evaluating numerous websites and extracts the precise information users seek. The timing of Anthropic’s announcement is particularly significant. With Safari searches declining for the first time ever — a metric Cue called unprecedented in his testimony — we’re witnessing early indicators of a mass consumer behavior shift. Traditional search engines optimized for advertising revenue are increasingly being bypassed in favor of conversation-based interactions that prioritize information quality over commercial interests. Under the hood: How Anthropic’s API transforms information retrieval for developers Anthropic’s technical approach represents a significant advance in how AI systems can be deployed as information gathering tools. The system employs a sophisticated decision-making layer that determines when external information would improve response quality, generating targeted search queries rather than simply passing user questions verbatim to a search backend. This “agentic” capability — allowing Claude to conduct multiple progressive searches using earlier results to inform subsequent queries — enables a more thorough research process than traditional search. The implementation essentially mimics how a human researcher might explore a topic, starting with general queries and progressively refining them based on initial findings. For developers, the API offers granular control through the max_uses parameter that limits how many sequential searches Claude can perform. This addresses both cost considerations and prevents the AI from falling into research rabbit holes. The domain control features provide crucial guardrails for enterprise deployments, allowing organizations to ensure information comes only from trusted sources. At $10 per 1,000 searches plus standard token costs, Anthropic has positioned the feature as a premium offering, suggesting confidence that the value proposition justifies the price point compared to direct integration with free search engines. AI search wars heat up: Big tech scrambles to redefine digital information access The competitive landscape around AI search has become increasingly crowded and contentious. OpenAI integrated web search into ChatGPT last fall and recently expanded with shopping features, leveraging its massive user base — 800 million weekly active users, according to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman — to challenge Google’s commercial search dominance. Apple’s potential pivot represents perhaps the most significant threat to the status quo. With Safari accounting for 17.25% of global browser usage and 22.32% on mobile devices according to the most current data from StatCounter, any move to replace Google with AI search alternatives would dramatically alter market dynamics. Apple’s discussions with Perplexity AI, OpenAI, and Anthropic suggest the company is actively exploring multiple partnerships rather than developing its own search technology. Meanwhile, specialized players like Perplexity AI are making strategic moves to embed themselves directly in the hardware ecosystem. Its partnership with Motorola represents an early attempt to position AI search as a device-level feature rather than merely an app or website. Google’s reported resistance to this partnership, revealed during antitrust proceedings, indicates the search giant recognizes the existential threat these new models pose. The court-mandated unwinding of Google’s Safari search deal — potentially eliminating up to $20 billion in annual payments to Apple — may accelerate this transition by removing the financial incentive for Apple to maintain the status quo. Content economy disruption: Publishers face existential threat as AI bypasses traditional websites The shift to AI search presents profound challenges for the content economy that has evolved around traditional search engines. When AI assistants provide direct answers synthesized from multiple sources, they dramatically reduce click-through to original content sites. This threatens the advertising-based business model that sustains much of the internet’s information ecosystem. Google Search vice president Pandu Nayak’s inability to offer “any guarantees” about traffic recovery highlights the gravity of this situation. Content creators face a future where being cited by AI may become more important than appearing in search results — yet citations alone don’t generate the advertising revenue that sustains content creation. This creates a potentially unsustainable dynamic: AI systems rely on high-quality web content to generate responses, but by redirecting user attention away from source websites, they undermine the economic model that produces that content. Without a new compensation mechanism for content creators, the long-term health of the information ecosystem could be compromised. For businesses, this shift demands a fundamental rethinking of digital strategy. Content optimized for traditional SEO may perform poorly in AI-mediated discovery, while content focused on providing clear, authoritative information may gain prominence even without traditional SEO markers. Anthropic’s web search API represents more than just another feature in the AI toolkit — it signals the evolution of internet information access toward a more integrated, conversation-based model. As search capabilities become embedded in AI assistants across applications, the distinction between searching, browsing, and asking questions continues to blur. This convergence is evident in how Quora is incorporating web search into its Poe platform and how Adaptive.ai plans to use it in customer-facing applications. Rather than search existing as a separate activity, it’s becoming an ambient capability woven throughout the digital experience. For everyday users, this could eventually eliminate the need to think about where to look for information — whether on Google, in a specialized app, or through an AI assistant. The cognitive load of navigating the internet’s information architecture would shift from humans to AI systems. The race to redefine search has evolved into something much larger: a competition to create the primary interface through which people access digital information. With Google’s traditional search model faltering, Apple potentially pivoting away from its long-standing Google partnership, and companies like Anthropic opening their capabilities to the developer ecosystem, we’re witnessing the most significant restructuring of information access since the advent of modern search engines. In this new paradigm, the winner won’t be determined by who has the best search algorithm, but by who creates the most intuitive, trusted, and capable AI interface to the world’s information. The era of typing keywords into a search box may soon be remembered as merely a transitional phase in our relationship with digital knowledge.
