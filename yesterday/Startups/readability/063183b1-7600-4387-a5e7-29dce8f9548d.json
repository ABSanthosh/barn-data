  "text": "What have we learned from the era of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies? They emerged quickly during the pandemic, seemingly out of nowhere, when zero percent interest rates prevailed. Today the market is a SPAC graveyard—with genetics testing startup 23andMe the latest casualty after declaring Chapter 11 bankruptcy late Sunday night.  According to new data from the financial analytics firm Debtwire, 23andMe is among 40 former SPACs that have filed for bankruptcy since 2022. That’s a failure rate that suggests the idea of taking a shortcut to a public listing was more of a quick buck idea that benefitted the sponsors over retail investors.  Debtwire’s chart, featured below, includes a few household names such as WeWork and Bird, the scooter-sharing startup. The corporate melodrama of WeWork is well known, and Bird only momentarily had its wings clipped—it’s since reemerged with new leadership and a less expansionary business model.  Among the list are tech companies Virgin Orbit Holdings Inc., part of mogul Richard Branson’s empire that sought to launch satellites into space, and AppHarvest, an indoor farming startup whose board once featured Vice President JD Vance.  The SPAC model was seen as a way to skirt the due diligence required in a typical IPO, and a path to make more money in a quicker time frame. By merging a startup with an already publicly listed shell company, all parties can ostensibly fastrack their way to a payout minus the regulatory hurdles. Typically, going public involves filing a form S-1—a detailed synopsis of a company’s business model, growth trajectory and history—with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A SPAC cuts through that red tape.  Markets surged during the pandemic, prompting a SPAC swell: 621 SPACs went public in 2021 alone, according to Nasdaq. The boom quickly dissipated, and in 2022, the SEC enacted new rules that made it more difficult to flood the public markets. The agency proposed “additional disclosures about SPAC sponsors, conflicts of interest, and sources of dilution,” an announcement said at the time. The rules were eventually adopted last January.  23andMe, headquartered in South San Francisco, went public during the short lived SPAC heyday in 2021 and quickly reached a valuation of $6 billion. 23andMe was among the more notable startups, and provided a great deal of intrigue to the public by promising testing that could reveal anyone’s genetic lineage—if they agreed to provide a saliva sample.  The company will continue to operate during the restructuring process and CEO Anne Wojcicki has resigned. She proposed taking the 23andMe private in February, which the company denied. Since the company maintains a sprawling repository of biological data, former customers are contending with how to protect their information as 23andMe enters a new and uncertain era.  The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
