Financial site SmartAsset used the most recent data available (February 2025) from the MIT Living Wage Calculator to gather the basic cost of living, including necessities like housing, food, transportation, and income taxes, to find how much salary it takes to live \"comfortably\" in each state.Researchers applied the cost of living in every U.S. state to a 50/30/20 budget (50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings) to sort the list. Unsurprisingly, Hawaii was found to be the most expensive state for a single adult to live comfortably.Related: Here's How Much a Family of 4 Needs to Live 'Comfortably' in Every U.S. State, According to a New Report Living \"comfortably\" is defined as earning enough money for needs like housing and wants like trying that pricey restaurant, while still being able to put away money for long-term savings. According to the report, it takes a minimum salary of $124,467 for a single adult to live comfortably there.According to a 2023 report from Hawaii Governor Josh Green, the Aloha State's housing market is the most expensive in the nation, and an annual income of $252K would be needed to afford a median-priced new home. West Virginia, meanwhile, was found to be the cheapest state for single adults, where a salary of \"only\" $80,829 is needed to live comfortably. Housing in West Virginia is 27% lower than the national average, and utilities are 6% lower, according to RentCafe. Still, this means that in the entire U.S., having a salary under $80,829 means you won't be \"comfortable.\"Here are the 10 most (and least) expensive states for a single adult with no children.Most Expensive States for a Single Adult With No Kids to Live Comfortably1.
