  "description": "Devastating wildfires tore through Los Angeles at the start of 2025. Nonprofit Baby2Baby was on the ground leveraging its deep knowledge of how to respond to natural disasters to help families in need. Co-CEOs Norah Weinstein and Kelly Sawyer Patricof joined host Jeff Berman on stage to reflect on what it was like to use everything they’d learned scaling their nonprofit to help their hometown in a moment of crisis. This Masters of Scale Live event, presented by Capital One Business, was recorded at Neuehouse in Los Angeles. To learn more about how you can support Baby2Baby, go to https://baby2baby.org/See Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
