  "text": "The global race toward creating an energy source that is carbon-free, consistent, and low risk is more than a decade in the making—and Helion Energy believes the end is in sight. The Washington-based nuclear fusion startup just landed a whopping $425 million in a series F round of funding that CFO Pragav Jain says is expected to fund the company through the targeted 2028 deployment of its first fusion power plant.“This funding will help us build a manufacturing supply chain infrastructure to meet the strong commercial demand of safe, limitless future power,” says Jain, who left a position at Waymo to join Helion about six months ago.Helion’s series F brings its total funding to more than $1 billion raised since its founding in 2013 and pushes the company’s valuation to $5.4 billion. The round includes participation from new investors Lightspeed Venture Partners, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, and a university endowment. Existing investors such as OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Mithril Capital, Capricorn Investment Group, Good Ventures Foundation, and Nucor also participated, according to an announcement.“These investors conducted fairly extensive due diligence on our technology development, commercialization plans and the market demand before choosing to participate in this round,” Jain says.Helion also announced in 2023 that Microsoft had agreed to purchase power from its first fusion power plant, which Jain says will put the “first electrons on the grid by 2028.” Helion also has an agreement with steel producer Nucor to develop a 500 MWe fusion power plant at one of its manufacturing facilities.Carolyn Kuranz, an associate professor of nuclear engineering and radiological sciences at the University of Michigan, declined to comment on Helion specifically, but says a 2028 goal “seems very fast” for the fusion industry at large.“There are a lot of both scientific and technical hurdles that still need to be overcome,” Kuranz says.Helion is designing a system that uses nuclear fusion to generate consistent, abundant, and carbon-free energy. Unlike today’s operational nuclear power plants, which rely on nuclear fission, or the process of breaking atoms apart, nuclear fusion generates electricity by combining atoms—much like the way the sun produces energy. But conditions on Earth are very different from those on the sun, of course, meaning the reaction is very difficult to sustain. A variety of companies and countries are working on nuclear fusion, using different techniques. Helion heats two different isotopes of helium into plasma, confines it with magnets, and then compresses it using a strong magnetic field until it gets to a temperature of about 100 million degrees Celsius, at which point the isotopes are so hot that they fuse together and release even more energy. The plasma expands during the process, pushing on the electromagnetic field and generating a current that is captured as electricity.Nuclear energy has earned increased attention in recent years from big tech companies, including Amazon and Google, which are in search of reliable, carbon-free sources of energy to power energy-hungry data centers. The energy needs of data centers are expected to surge dramatically in coming years due to the computing demands of artificial intelligence—not to mention the rising energy needs of a growing global population.Although Helion was founded well before the generative AI gold rush, Jain says buzzy technology has offered a helpful boost to the nuclear industry.“AI just provides additional tail winds, because it’s going to accelerate demand for energy more than ever,” he says. “And I think fusion is the solution without the issue that comes with fission or fossil fuels to meet those increased energy needs.” Although fission is readily available in the form of existing nuclear reactors, one future benefit of fusion over fission, Kuranz says, is that nuclear fusion involves a smaller amount of radioactive material. It also has an extremely short half life and can be stored on-site and recycled to fuel the powerplant.“Nuclear fission and nuclear fusion plants are nearly carbon-free methods of producing energy, so that makes them both very attractive,” says Kuranz. “However, you do have to deal with radioactive material for nuclear fission.” Helion isn’t the only company working to make nuclear fusion a commercial reality—although its timeline is perhaps the most ambitious. Other innovators in the space include Commonwealth Fusion Systems, General Fusion, and TAE, TechCrunch reported last year. Chinese state media reported in late January that the country’s Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) fusion generator more than doubled a previous record, which would represent a major breakthrough in fusion technology.“It’s definitely something that should be on our radar overall, both for economic reasons and for national security reasons as well,” Kuranz says.",
