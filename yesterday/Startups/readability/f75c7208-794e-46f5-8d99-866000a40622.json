  "text": "February 27, 2025 3:08 PM Owlchemy announced today that its handtracking VR game, Dimensional Double Shift, has passed the milestone of 500,000 downloads, making it the fastest-growing game in the studio’s catalog. The game is still in beta via the Open Beta Trainee Program, with Owlchemy saying it plans to release more content for the title later this year. The studio also revealed other details about the game so far, including that players have put 1.3 million hours into the various in-game diners, and that they’ve completed 7.4 million orders. The game is a co-op title, meaning players have to collaborate to complete their increasingly zany tasks. One of the game’s standout features is the hand-tracking, which makes for complex in-game interactions. Andrew Eiche, Owlchemy CEO (or CEOwl, as we’ve been informed), said in a statement, “The resounding success of Dimensional Double Shift shows that our instincts were right: People want to play VR with their friends in a fun and seamless environment. What we didn’t expect was it to take off so quickly while we were still in Beta. This 500,000-download milestone is a testament to the unparalleled appetite for ingenuity and a dash of absurdity that players are hungry for.” Owlchemy’s previous games include the likes of Job Simulator and Vacation Simulator, bringing VR fun to mundane activities. Dimensional Double Shift originally launched on the Meta Quest 3 and 3S, with its early access period beginning last September. GB Daily Stay in the know!
