  "text": "For too long, the best financial tools were built for big companies with deep pockets and full IT teams. Today, that’s no longer the case. In my conversations about the future of fintech, I often reference the flywheel effect: the idea that transformation builds slowly until it hits a breakthrough inflection point. That’s where we are today. From faster payment rails and stable coins, to embedded finance and AI-powered financial agents, a few major fintech trends are reshaping how money moves, how decisions are made, and how businesses of all sizes serve their customers.  But what do these three trends actually mean for your business? And how can you benefit from them? 1. Accessibility to digital tools is killing the spreadsheet In the last few years, money movement has gone from a back-office burden to a front-line growth lever. Faster payments, smart routing, and bank-to-bank options are making it possible for small businesses to get paid instantly, reduce delays, and avoid cash flow bottlenecks. Still, many are stuck with legacy systems: cash, paper checks, manual data entry, and monthly reconciliations done with a trusted highlighter and a spreadsheet. Why? Because spreadsheets feel safe, and change feels risky. But it’s that mindset that could be costing small businesses. The truth is, these tools weren’t built for modern business operations. They don’t send reminders when payments are due. They don’t alert you or predict when cash flow is tight. They don’t auto-populate data or learn from your behavior.  AI technologies offer new possibilities for small businesses to automate tasks and optimize business processes. According to recent data from Intuit QuickBooks, 45 percent of small businesses experienced a significant increase in revenue, compared to just 30 percent of businesses using digital tools less frequently. Fintech’s growing priority is to make these tools work for you, and the way you do business will only close that gap further. The more accessible these tools become, the more they’ll help small businesses stay competitive, improve efficiency, reduce costs, and access new markets.  2. Embedded finance will end late payments When cash flow is unpredictable, inefficiency becomes a liability. As a small business grows, so does the volume of transactions, vendors, and financial decisions—and the number of tools they use. What once worked with five clients can quickly break down with 50. Managing disconnected tools and toggling between systems is like building a modern house with just a hammer—possible to do, but costly in time and lost revenue. A recent Intuit QuickBooks Solutions Survey found that businesses manage 10 different software programs on average, leading to wasted time managing such disconnected systems. The best financial tools are the ones we don’t even realize we’re using. That’s what embedded finance is. Embedded finance is redefining how small businesses move money by eliminating the need for extra steps in their day-to-day operations. It integrates services like payments, lending, or insurance directly into the tools small businesses already use. With financial functionality integrated into the workflow, it removes friction and makes everyday tasks easier to complete. Lending is one of the most promising examples of embedded finance. Instead of requiring lengthy applications, embedded lending solutions can surface pre-qualified offers based on real-time financial data, directly within the platforms small businesses rely on. Like a shock absorber to smooth out a small business’s cashflow, repayment can be automated and aligned with cashflow, giving businesses streamlined access to capital without the usual friction.  Customer-facing lending takes this a step further. By embedding financing options directly into estimates or invoices, small businesses can help their customers secure funding options in minutes. In turn, small businesses can get cash in hand faster, leading to fewer stalled projects and more deals closed, especially for high-ticket purchases like home repairs or construction. Given that over half of small business owners have invoices overdue by more than 30 days, with an average of $27,000 outstanding according to our research, these tools will help improve their cash flow and predictability. 3. AI agents are doing more than ever for businesses  Small business owners have always had to do more with less. I saw this personally when watching my mother run her law office, as she sought to improve her business operations with her team and technology. When teams are lean, you don’t get the luxury of delegating; you’re sending invoices one minute, responding to leads the next, and closing the books at the end of the day. But we’re reaching a turning point. AI agents are starting to take on those tasks, quietly working in the background to lighten the load. This technology has come at a time when it’s needed most. In April 2025, small business employment in the U.S. declined by 0.55 percent, and average real monthly revenue dropped by 1.70 percent. With margins tightening, every minute and every decision matters more. When you can’t hire, the work doesn’t disappear—it just piles up. AI agents give small business owners some extra leverage. Not by replacing roles outright, but by filling in the gaps where time, headcount, or budget fall short.  They’re becoming a new channel for getting work done, whether that by surfacing smarter insights, routing actions, or helping owners respond faster in the moments that matter. It’s a level of time savings that businesses with leaner teams didn’t think was possible. For example, one business owner told me how AI-powered tools helped her turn meeting notes into a client-ready estimate that she could send off in just a few clicks.  In the future of small business finance, tools will operate seamlessly in the background, enabling faster money movement, automatic reconciliation, and real-time forecasts. Entrepreneurs that adopt these efficient, automated tools will thrive as fintech evolves to support businesses of all sizes. The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is this Friday, June 27, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
