  "text": "April 15, 2025 10:00 AM Credit: VentureBeat made with Midjourney Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More Anthropic launched major upgrades to its Claude AI assistant today, introducing an autonomous research capability and Google Workspace integration that transform the AI into what the company calls a “true virtual collaborator” for enterprise users. The expansion directly challenges OpenAI and Microsoft in the increasingly competitive market for AI productivity tools. The new Research capability enables Claude to independently conduct multiple searches that build upon each other while determining what to investigate next. Simultaneously, the Google Workspace integration connects Claude to users’ emails, calendars, and documents, eliminating the need for manual uploads. Credit: Anthropic ‘Minutes not hours’: How Claude’s research speed aims to win over busy executives Anthropic positions Claude’s Research functionality as dramatically faster than competing solutions, promising comprehensive answers in minutes rather than the “up to 30 minutes” they claim rival products require. “At Anthropic, we’re laser-focused on enterprise workers and use cases, and our Research tool is reflective of that,” an Anthropic spokesperson told VentureBeat. “Research is a tool to help enterprise workers get well-researched answers to queries in less than a minute. Other solutions on the market take up to 30 minutes to generate responses — that’s not what your average Sales exec or financial services employee needs.” This speed-focused approach represents a calculated bet that enterprise users prioritize quick responses for time-sensitive decisions over more exhaustive but slower research capabilities. Claude’s Drive integration suggests ways to analyze documents, revealing patterns in how users work with their files. (Credit: Anthropic) Enterprise-grade security promises to keep company data protected while Claude works For technical decision makers considering AI tools, data security remains paramount. Anthropic emphasizes its security-first approach, particularly for the Google Drive Catalog feature that uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) techniques. “Privacy is foundational to our approach. We don’t train our models on user data by default,” the Anthropic spokesperson said. “We’ve implemented strict authentication and access control mechanisms. Each user or organization’s connections to external services are properly authenticated and authorized for only that specific user or organization.” The company restricts its Google Drive Catalog feature to Enterprise plan customers, which includes “enhanced security infrastructure, dedicated support, and advanced administrative controls designed for organizations with stringent data protection requirements.” Claude prepares for a sales meeting by scanning a user’s emails and calendar – a task that once took hours. (Credit: Anthropic) Fighting AI hallucinations: How Claude uses citations to build trust Anthropic tackles one of AI’s most persistent challenges — the tendency to generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information — through explicit source citation. “Anthropic is dedicated to building the most trustworthy enterprise AI tools. When conducting research — whether on the Web or in internal docs — Claude cites its sources so users can easily reference where information is coming from,” according to the spokesperson. This verification mechanism addresses growing enterprise demand for accountable AI, especially in business-critical applications where accuracy determines success. Real-world ROI: Early users report hours saved across multiple departments Though still in early beta, Anthropic reports promising results from internal testing, with employees “saved hours every week that they typically spent drudging through a sea of docs and emails.” The company highlighted several implementations, including communications teams compiling launch information and briefing books, engineers preparing for client meetings by researching industry news and reviewing existing documents, and sales leaders analyzing sector growth without manual data work. “New employees are skipping the classic ‘new hire questions’ and asking Claude to summarize upcoming company moments, OKRs and share relevant style guides,” the spokesperson noted, suggesting potential applications beyond day-to-day productivity. The AI assistant wars heat up: How Claude compares to ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini Anthropic’s updates arrive amid fierce competition. OpenAI’s ChatGPT offers web browsing, Microsoft’s Copilot integrates with Office 365, and Google’s Gemini connects with Workspace applications. Anthropic differentiates Claude through a combination of speed, enterprise focus, and what it describes as a more autonomous approach to research and information retrieval. The Research feature is available in early beta for Max, Team, and Enterprise plans in the United States, Japan, and Brazil. Web search has expanded to Brazil and Japan after its U.S. launch in March. The Google Workspace integration is available in beta to all paid users, though administrators must enable it company-wide before individual use. From assistants to collaborators: The new era of AI knowledge work As AI systems evolve from simple query responders to proactive research partners, they’re reshaping how knowledge work happens. Claude’s new capabilities represent more than incremental feature additions—they signal a fundamental shift in the relationship between professionals and their digital tools. For enterprises navigating digital transformation, the question isn’t whether AI will transform knowledge work, but how quickly. Anthropic’s vision of AI that can independently research, reason through problems, and connect directly with workplace systems suggests a future where the most valuable human skills may not be information gathering but rather asking the right questions. n the high-stakes race to make AI truly useful for everyday work, Claude’s latest upgrades reveal that the finish line isn’t just smarter AI — it’s AI that works the way humans already do.
