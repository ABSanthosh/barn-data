  "text": "As CEO of the Seattle-based payments processing company Gravity Payments, Dan Price built a reputation as a corporate crusader with an aggressive social justice agenda. His Linkedin posts excoriated other CEOs for treating workers unfairly and regularly went viral. Now he’s the focus of criticism. Price was charged in September by a California grand jury of rape of an unconscious victim, according to reports in the New York Times and Seattle Times, which cited legal filings that were unsealed last week. Price was on the cover of Inc Magazine in 2015, and took to X last week to acknowledge his appearance in Riverside Superior Court. He wrote last Thursday that he looks “forward to the opportunity to prove my innocence.” An additional charge of rape of an intoxicated person was dismissed, according to last week’s unsealed documents. Price didn’t respond to an email request for comment. The 40-year-old founder was first accused of sexual assault in 2021, when his then-girlfriend Kacie Margis told police Price raped her while she was unconscious. A New York Times investigation in 2022 first revealed Margis’s accusations to the public, and also painted a picture of Price that was far gloomier than the empathetic and conscientious persona he had cultivated on social media in years prior. For the investigation, over a dozen women recounted physical and emotional abuse dealt by Price. Last Thursday, Price addressed the accusations first reported in the 2022 Times investigation, writing on X: “This false accusation was first promoted in a blog of someone trying to bring me down in 2021 and then promoted worldwide in the press in 2022. I am going to prove that the allegation is false in court.” Price has long maintained his innocence. His attorney, Vicki Podberesky, told the New York Times last week: “Nothing has changed in the two years since these allegations were first reported: There is no credible evidence to support this accusation, and Mr. Price categorically denies that he sexually assaulted anyone.”Price gained notoriety for promoting wage equality at his company when it was still taboo to talk about corporate compensation in the open, and before salary transparency laws were passed in California and New York City. He was something of a media darling who appeared on cable news to opine on the state of corporate greed, and regularly talked up Gravity Payments’s policy of paying everyone at the company–including himself–$70,000 a year. Following the Times’s investigation, Price resigned from Gravity Payments, which he founded in 2004. He returned to the company in May, the Seattle Times reported. Price is expected to be arraigned in January of 2025.",
