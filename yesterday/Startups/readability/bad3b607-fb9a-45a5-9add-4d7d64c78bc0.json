This, in turn, leads to more congestion, more potholes, and more accidents. To correct this cycle, startup ScanwAi uses an AI-powered digital monitoring system to bring infrastructure maintenance into the 21st century, making it smarter, safer, and more sustainable for everyone. Instead of relying on manual assessments, which are time-consuming and expensive, ScanwAi uses real-time data and predictive analytics to determine where road repairs are most needed. ScanwAi’s Infra Monitoring System, which is used on a pre-installed phone on a car’s windshield, can capture high-resolution images and automatically tag them with GPS coordinates, making it easier to locate issues. The technology can also detect different types of damage to road surfaces, such as different types of cracks and potholes. In addition to location and condition, ScanwAi offers neutral, independent survey and video data embedded with timestamps and GPS coordinates, ensuring precise and verifiable documentation of road conditions. The system also includes an automatic infrabalance feature that continuously monitors and adjusts the balance of infrastructure elements, reducing maintenance costs and improving safety.  Co-founder and CEO Juha Rytkönen told Springwise that the aim is to “maximise the impact of our service and contribute to the development of sustainable cities on a larger scale”. In order to do this, ScanwAi is working to forge relationships with key stakeholders and continuously improve its technology. The company aims to work closely with local governments, universities, and organisations to tailor its solutions to the specific needs of each city, as well as collaborate with educational institutions to provide training and development opportunities.
