  "text": "On Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld the ban-or-sale law of TikTok which puts the social media site on a countdown for a fast-looming deadline. On Jan. 19, app stores and internet services in the U.S. could face hefty fines for hosting TikTok if it is not sold. (President Joe Biden is empowered to issue a one-time extension of the deadline, should he choose.) Some entrepreneurs who have built a following on TikTok say the court’s decision to uphold a TikTok ban could have severe negative consequences on their business.“The ruling is concerning to me,” says Craig Mount co-founder, NerdyNuts, a Rapid City, SD-based flavored peanut butter business that has leveraged TikTok (and its 728,000 followers on the app) to grow from selling at local farmers markets into a multi-million-dollar business. “I have 70 employees and we sponsor local schools and your sports. People count on us. It’s really scary to hear a large portion of the amount of money you could be making could be gone overnight.”The strength of TikTok, Mount says, is how it has made the process of impulse purchases especially easy for users.Alyssa McKay, co-founder of NYC-based streetwear brand Beyond Lost, said she has long focused on diversification across social media and the appeals court decision won’t alter her brand strategy—and, for now, she’ll just hope for the best when it comes to TikTok and her 11,000 followers sticking around.“I feel confident in the channels and communities I have fostered across social,” she says. “The news today will not change my content creation/posting strategy. It seems like TikTok still plans to fight, so I will continue as usual – until I can no longer do so—if that ever happens.”Many entrepreneurs are optimistic about TikTok’s long-term chances of continuing operations in the U.S. The company is almost certain to appeal Friday’s decision to the Supreme Court and that could extend the deadline. Donald Trump has also indicated he could be open to not enforcing the ban when he takes office, the day after the current deadline.Not every business owner who has interacted with TikTok would be especially sorry if the app should go away, however. Lerin Lockwood is founder and CEO of Lion Latch, a Burnet, Texas-based maker of protective cases for jewelry that made the 2024 Inc. 500 list. She says she saw incredible success with TikTok in 2023, when her product became the platform’s top seller for months. After TikTok removed the sales cap, she was seeing 1,200 orders per day—and her company’s follower count grew from 100,000 to 400,000.This year, though, she says, sales plunged on TikTok as she claims it allowed other sellers to infringe on her patents. “Their platform only offers protection for trademarks and copyrights, meaning sellers can list infringing items as long as they don’t use my trademark or images,” Lockwood says. “The process of registering trademarks or copyrights on TikTok’s IP Protection Center is frustratingly slow. … Getting TikTok to review complaints about infringing sellers takes an equally long time.” (Inc. reached out to TikTok for a comment and will update if it responds.)Lockwood has been steering customers to her company’s website instead.Meanwhile, Friday’s appeals court ruling to uphold the TikTok ban served as a warning to small businesses and entrepreneurs that rely on the app as a major marketing vehicle: If you haven’t diversified your efforts yet, it’s time.Marketing experts say that while there’s no need to abandon the app at this point, if you haven’t been cultivating other platforms and revenue streams, that needs to become a priority.“While there’s still time before a ban would be enforced, the clock is ticking and it’s better to prepare now, rather than scramble later,” says Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at eMarketer. “While no other platform has been able to replicate the kind of viral success that many entrepreneurs have found on TikTok, there is plenty of shopping happening on other social platforms.”That said, transitioning from TikTok to another platform may not be as easy as it sounds.“Over the past five years, we’ve developed a system for making money on this platform,” says Mount. “It’s not a system that’s easily replaced. I’m not saying we’re going to go under. We have over 700,000 customers. We’ve done over one million in orders on Shopify. But getting new customers? That’s going to be a tough one for us.”",
