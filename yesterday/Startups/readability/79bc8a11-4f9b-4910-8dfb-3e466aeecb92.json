These firms have been extending offers to junior bankers at the start of their job training at Goldman Sachs, or before they even begin training, in a process known as on-cycle recruitment.Related: Here Are the Odds of Landing a Summer Internship at Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan Goldman Sachs isn't the only bank on Wall Street to crack down on poaching from private equity firms.

According to federal filings pulled by Business Insider, Apollo pays analysts a base salary of $115,000 to $150,000. Associates make anywhere from $125,000 to $200,000.
