A Friday report from The Verge shows that Adobe doesn't plan to offer alternative versions of products without AI for artists who oppose the technology.Related: I Tried the 'Anti-AI App' That Suddenly Drew Half a Million Artists Away From Instagram \"Our goal is to make our customers successful, and we think that in order for them to be successful, they need to embrace the tech,\" Adobe's vice president of generative AI Alexandru Costin told the publication.Adobe's pro-AI stance is at odds with some of its user base, who were outraged earlier this year when Adobe changed its terms of use.The language of the terms left the door open for Adobe to train its AI on user images.Adobe has since updated its terms of service to clarify that it will not use local or cloud content to train generative AI, but anti-AI sentiment remains strong among creatives.In June, an anti-AI app named Cara gained over half a million users in a week for its focus on human-created art. The app, which looks similar to Instagram, bans users from posting AI-generated images. It also automatically protects art against AI training by adding a \"NoAI\" label to all images that users upload.Related: Using AI to Promote Your Business?
