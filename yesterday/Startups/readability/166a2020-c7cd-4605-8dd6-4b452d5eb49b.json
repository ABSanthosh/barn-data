  "text": "Too many businesses pour time and money into developing products or services that ultimately fail. The reason? They never validated their assumptions before launching.Concept testing reduces that risk. Use this four-step structured approach to ensure your teams capture valuable insights to refine and optimize ideas before launch.1. Define Items to TestStart by listing the key assumptions, features, or attributes of the concept that need validation. These could include: Product functionality Does it solve the intended problem? Customer demand Do people actually want this? Pricing model Will they pay for it, and if so, how much? Usability Is it intuitive and easy to use? Example: A subscription-based fitness app may want to test whether users prefer AI-driven personalized workouts or live-streamed coaching sessions.2. Identify Research SubjectsWho is your target audience? The feedback you gather is only useful if it comes from the right people: potential customers who represent your real market. These could include: Existing customers Potential buyers Industry experts Early adopters of similar products Example: A meal kit delivery company might survey busy professionals and working parents to see if they value pre-prepped ingredients over fully cooked meals.3. Identify Test MethodThe way you test your concept depends on the product, budget, and how quickly you need results. Common testing methods include: These could include: Online surveys Quick and cost-effective for gathering broad feedback. Focus groups Deeper insights from small, targeted groups. A/B testing Testing different versions of an idea to see which performs better. Landing page tests Gauge interest by tracking signups or engagement with a prototype. Example: A SaaS startup might create two versions of a landing page—one highlighting AI-driven automation and the other emphasizing cost savings—to see which messaging drives more sign-ups.4. Write Questions to Gather Actionable InsightsAsking the right questions is key to collecting meaningful feedback. Avoid vague or leading questions. Instead, focus on understanding how users feel about the concept and what improvements they would suggest. Good concept testing questions include: What problem does this product/service solve for you? What do you like or dislike about this concept? Would you pay for this? If so, how much? What would make this more valuable to you? Example: A company developing a smart home security system might ask: “Would you prefer a lower upfront cost with a monthly subscription, or a higher one-time cost with no ongoing fees?”Why Concept Testing Is Critical for InnovationSuccessful products are built around deep customer insights gathered through early-stage testing. Businesses that skip this step risk launching products that don’t align with market needs, miss key features, or have major usability flaws.For example, Amazon initially tested the idea of a voice-controlled assistant by launching the Echo with limited functionality. Early feedback helped refine Alexa’s features, making it one of the most successful smart home devices today.Tutorial The Bottom LineInnovation isn’t just about creativity—it’s about creating solutions that people want. Concept testing helps businesses validate ideas, refine features, and make data-driven decisions before committing resources.I’ve included the Concept Testing template in my Innovation Master Class. It’s a practical tool any innovation team can use to increase chances of launching a successful product or service by testing early, testing often, and letting your customers guide your innovation process.Want more practical strategies for driving innovation?
