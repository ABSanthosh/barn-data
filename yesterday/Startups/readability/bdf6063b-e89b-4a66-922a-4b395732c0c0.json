That’s among about $47,000 in medical expenses that Hoesch has racked up so far and another $50,000 of medical costs he expects in the future, the suit states.Columbia River Fire \u0026 Rescue declined to comment. Allstate Fire and Casualty Insurance Co. didn’t respond to a request for comment. The suit claims that Hoesch’s uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage is obligated to cover any damages that Columbia River Fire \u0026 Rescue is unable to.According to the lawsuit, Hoesch was pedaling through the small town of Rainier in Columbia County in October 2022 when he and the ambulance were traveling the same direction on a street that’s a mix of homes and businesses. The ambulance attempted to make a right turn onto another street, crashing into Hoesch and destroying his bicycle, according to the suit, which was filed Oct. 24.William Hoesch is pictured here after he and an ambulance collided while he was riding his bicycle in October 2022.Submitted photoThe crash happened in front of Columbia River Fire \u0026 Rescue’s Rainier station, as the ambulance was returning from a trip.According to police reports, the driver who struck Hoesch and a passenger in the ambulance estimated the ambulance was going between 2 mph and 10 mph when they heard a thump, stopped and saw Hoesch injured. Hoesch estimated to police that he was going 5 mph to 10 mph and said he didn’t think the ambulance was going to turn in front of him. His bicycle was crushed under the ambulance wheel.Hoesch’s lawsuit also seeks $900,000 for pain and suffering, stating he suffered decreased range of motion, reduced grip strength and other symptoms.A Rainier Police Department report included this photo of the crash scene involving William Hoesch and a Columbia River Fire \u0026 Rescue ambulance.Rainier Police DepartmentAmbulance crashes involving cars, cyclists or pedestrians are rare but not unheard of in Oregon. Last month, the estate of 25-year-old Kelsey Seibel filed a $6 million lawsuit against South Lincoln Ambulance and Yachats Rural Fire Protection District, stating that one of their ambulances made a left turn in front of Seibel’s car on U.S. 101, killing Seibel in January 2024.And on July 18 at 1 a.m., Oregon State Police say an AMR ambulance hit a car with a flat tire parked on the side of Interstate 84 in Hood River County, killing 55-year-old Geraldean Martin, who was standing outside her car. No lawsuit has been filed in that case.— Aimee Green covers breaking news and the justice system.
