  "text": "Pop quiz: You own a business that has an office on the other side of town. You buy a new vehicle, which you drive 300 miles a week for these three instances: 100 miles a week going to and from your home and your office. 100 miles a week doing various business activities such as client and site visits, quotes, and supply runs. 100 miles a week with the family. Kid’s activities, shopping, and weekend recreation trips. The question is, how much of the above is business use?If you answered 1/3 (or 33 percent) you’d be correct. In general, only the second scenario is considered business use by the IRS. Obviously, the third scenario is clearly personal use, but many people would incorrectly assume the first scenario—to and from the office—is business use. It’s not. In the eyes of the Internal Revenue Service, the first scenario is simply the normal “commute” that millions of people do in a non-tax-deductible manner daily. Owning the business doesn’t change this.Business and personal use is not always straightforwardThe above “to and from work” example is one small example where people can get confused regarding business and personal use and their taxes. And this is something you should get right, not only at tax time, but also when you are preparing to acquire and insure the item in question. Because the way you pay for a vehicle, and how you insure it, could change depending on the use and tax advantages (or lack thereof). I see and address this question often in my equipment financing activities, so it’s something to think about from day one.  Before I go any further, I do need to state I am not an accountant or a tax professional, nor am I an insurance agent, so I’m going to use words like “generally” or “often.” I am also going to tell you some of the best money you can spend is on an accountant or tax pro. These business-use rules change often and, in different tax scenarios, can even overlap, so you should always consult a tax professional for definitive answers before making any tax-related purchase or decision.Count only business useThe IRS typically allows deductions (or depreciation) only for the portion of a vehicle that’s used in a trade or business. Given this, it is important that you demonstrate the different percentages of use. A mileage log is ideal for this. Now, what type of deduction and how much will typically depend on the vehicle, your business, the use percentage, and other factors.For heavy SUVs and similar vehicles, you can typically claim a partial Section 179 Deduction if the vehicle’s GVW (gross vehicle weight) is 6,000 lbs. or more. The business use percentage must be greater than 50 percent, and the deduction will be equal to the business use percentage, up to a pre-determined limit. For 2025, it’s $31,300. In some cases, bonus depreciation can be used. Your accountant will know.Smaller SUV’s, light trucks, and passenger cars can qualify for a partial Section 179 deduction if the business use is over 50 percent. Like the SUVs, there is a limit. For 2025, it’s $20,400.Instead of Section 179, certain mixed-use situations may claim specific mileage which could be more advantageous depending on the vehicle, the business, and the usage.For tax (and perhaps other) purposes, sole proprietors and single-member LLCs can typically put the title of a mixed-use vehicle in either your or the business’s name. However, for regular LLCs and corporations, the title must typically be in the business’s name.Tip: Do not overstate the business use part. You cannot claim 100 percent business use if you use the vehicle for even the occasional errand.Purchasing and insuring mixed use vehiclesRegarding insurance, you should absolutely make your insurance company aware of the mixed-use nature of the vehicle. I knew someone who started a landscaping business and didn’t tell his insurer. He got into an accident while pulling a trailer with his mowing equipment, and the accident photos also clearly showed his magnetic sign on the truck. Oops. Claim denied.On the same note, if you’re looking to work for Uber or Doordash or do similar work, you should tell your insurer.In buying mixed-use vehicles, from an equipment-financing perspective, most commercial lenders will not finance anything less than a 100 percent business-use vehicle (and will often have this language written into the contract). So for purchasing a mixed-use vehicle, it’s often advisable to go the consumer route: Your local bank or dealer financing is probably your best bet. But just like insurance, let them know the mixed-use intent beforehand.One last note on buying mixed-use vehicles: If the business use percentage isn’t going to be high enough to make a difference on your taxes, it may make better sense to lease the vehicle. You may have a lower payment and a shorter term.The above is meant to be general information, not tax or insurance advice specific to your situation. As always, consult your accountant and insurance agent before making any related purchase or decision. They will steer you in the right direction.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",
