Fielding said in a statement, “It’s been an honor to work closely with such a talented leader as Kristian Segerstrale, and I look forward to collaborating with him in his new role. I’m excited for the future of Super Evil as we begin to realize the long term plans we have in motion to grow SEMC into a top tier independent studio with world class talent that creates unforgettable shared gaming experiences.” Ian Fielding is the new CEO of Super Evil Megacorp. Fielding formerly worked at Riot Games, where he worked on League of Legends and Valorant, as well as Insomniac.
