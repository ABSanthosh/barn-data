This includes cutting 30% of its menu, adding new directives like making coffee in under four minutes, and writing customers' names down with Sharpies on their cups. What Is the New Starbucks Barista Dress Code?Starbucks is calling the new dress code a \"more defined color palette,\" which means a solid black (only) crewneck, collared, or button-up shirt in either short and long-sleeves.For bottoms, crewmembers can wear \"any shade\" of khaki, black, or blue denim. The company said it is also making a new line of company-branded T-shirts that will be \"available to partners, who will receive two at no cost.\"The AP notes that in 2019, Starbucks began allowing one facial piercing for its front-facing employees, and that still stands with the new dress code.Starbucks has more than 40,000 stores worldwide, with 16,941 in the U.S. The company has used the green apron as its symbol since 1987.Related: Starbucks Is Limiting Mobile Orders to Reclaim the Coffeehouse's 'Connection' With Customers",
