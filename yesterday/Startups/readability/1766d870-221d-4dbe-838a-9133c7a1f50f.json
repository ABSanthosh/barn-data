  "text": "Red Bull Gaming has signed a deal with Fortnite star Ali “SypherPK” Hassan. With more than 26.4 million followers across platforms, SypherPK’s decade-long streaming career took off alongside the rise of Fortnite in 2018. His educational content and tips and tricks earned him his very own Fortnite skin in 2022 as well as a spot among the top 25 most subscribed-to streamers on Twitch.  Beyond streaming, he’s made a name for himself as an entrepreneur and fitness advocate, bringing that same discipline and drive to the studio and gym. Whether helping players level up in-game or motivating fans to push themselves IRL, SypherPK continues to inspire a global community with his ambition and relentless work ethic, aligning closely with Red Bull’s values. Beginning with this weekend’s $500,000 FNCS Pro-Am tournament in Los Angeles, the pair will find opportunities to create unique and engaging experiences around SypherPK and his Fortnite community. The Fortnite Championship Series Pro-Am tournament at the Galen Center in Los Angeles, California. His rise to prominence in 2018 was tied to the explosive growth of Fortnite and earned him his first 1 million subscribers on both Twitch and YouTube that year. His growth has continued since, crossing the 10 million subscriber threshold in late 2024 and cementing himself as one of the top 25 most subscribed-to streamers on Twitch.  SypherPK’s signing stems from a long-standing admiration for Red Bull. Not only was he already a consumer, but also a fan of the brand’s contributions to the gaming creator space, including early support for Fortnite talent like Ninja. As with all Red Bull Gaming player signings, authenticity and connection are key, and SypherPK exemplifies both. Beyond gaming, SypherPK is known for his inspirational approach to content. He is a strong advocate for wellness and fitness, having lost 75 pounds over the course of a year—a journey he openly shares with his community to encourage healthy lifestyle habits. SypherPK joins a growing roster of Red Bull Fortnite creators and competitors, including “Lachlan” Ross Power, Kyle “Mongraal” Jackson, Amar “Amar” Al-Naimi, and Martin “MrSavage” Foss Andersen. Most recently, Red Bull Gaming and MrSavage collaborated to set a Guinness World Record for the longest-range elimination in Fortnite with over 1,161.31 meters between the creator and his monitor.
