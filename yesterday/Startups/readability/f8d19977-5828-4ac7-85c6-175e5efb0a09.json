One of her tasks was delivering an envelope to an apartment on the top floor of a building on Fifth Avenue and 97th Street.When Corcoran entered the apartment, she was impressed by its terrace with views of Central Park. She gave the home's owner her envelope and told her to call if she ever thought about selling the unit. \"I walked in and saw this green, lush terrace through the French doors, and said to the lady who let me in, 'If you're ever going to sell this, would you sell it to me?'\" Corcoran told The New York Times in a previous interview.Related: 'How Lucky Am I?': Tour Barbara Corcoran's $13 Million New York Apartment More than two decades later, she got a phone call: The home's owner was ready to sell.
