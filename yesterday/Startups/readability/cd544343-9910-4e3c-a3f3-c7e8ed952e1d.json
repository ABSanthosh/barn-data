  "text": "In 2024 alone, the global average cost of a data breach was nearly $5 million. And many of those attacks began on a single device.That shouldn’t be surprising when you think about it. Laptops, workstations, remote monitoring management tools, VPNs, and even point-of-sale terminals have become more than just productivity tools for businesses. They’ve become entryways for malicious hackers.Better known as “endpoints” in tech circles, these IT systems are hot targets. But attackers aren’t necessarily after the hardware. They’re after the access it grants to a whole other place: the cloud.Endpoints are the launchpad to the cloudWhen you log into cloud-based applications like Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace, your device saves a browser session cookie. It’s like a digital ID that lets the app know you’re an authenticated user.Hackers who breach an endpoint and steal a cookie stored on your hard drive can gain unrestricted access to your apps. That means no passwords, login prompts, or multi-factor authentication. They just take over your session to move around your IT environment like they own the place. What’s their end game? Access to all your data, including customer and payment information, banking info, and more. This data is used to extort money from you. Worse yet, stolen cookies often end up for sale on the dark web. For just a few dollars, shady hackers can buy their way into your systems, steal your IP, and hack cloud platforms with frightening ease.Why antivirus falls shortThere was a time when you’d buy a new computer and find Norton or McAfee antivirus (AV) software already installed. That was all you needed back then to protect yourself. Install the AV and update it occasionally, and you’re good to go.But times have changed. Today’s cyber threats can easily bypass everything AVs were built to stop. Hackers are much sneakier, hiding inside legitimate tools, mimicking normal behaviors, and slipping past your defenses without setting off any alarms.Traditional AVs struggle because they can: Only catch what they know: It can’t recognize new, emerging threats, and hackers are getting pretty crafty in breaking and entering. Miss suspicious behavior: Like when a hacker creates a rogue admin account or quietly installs remote access tools. Overlook session theft: Cookie hijacking won’t even register. None of this is to say AV software is useless. But it should really serve as a sidekick to more advanced cybersecurity tools.What’s an EDR and what does it do?To stay ahead, businesses must pair their AV with a more intelligent layer of protection called endpoint detection and response (EDR). Unlike AV, which relies on scanning files against known malware, EDR continuously monitors behavior on endpoints. It learns what your “normal” activity looks like and identifies any deviations, ensuring anything suspicious is flagged before it can do damage.Here’s what a typical EDR offers: Behavior-based detection: EDRs identify shady activity, such as deleting backup files, adding new users, or encrypting everything out of the blue. Session protection: EDRs are a starting point to thwart identity-based attacks by detecting attempts to steal cookies. Tool misuse detection: As hackers grow more sophisticated, EDRs recognize when legit admin tools are being exploited for malicious purposes. Unlike AV software, an EDR doesn’t just warn you about potential threats. It takes quick, decisive action. When it detects something’s wrong, it can isolate the affected endpoint, shut down harmful processes, and stop the threat from spreading, all in real time.How to remove the burden of endpoint securityEDRs have a downside: They aren’t “set-it-and-forget-it” tools. And many are designed for those with Fortune 500-sized budgets and security infrastructures. To be effective, EDRs need ongoing monitoring, regular fine-tuning, and experts to respond to threats. This might seem unattainable for a smaller business, especially if one doesn’t have the time, resources, or in-house team to handle it all.That’s where managed service providers (MSPs) or managed security service providers (MSSPs) come in. These specialized—often regionally located—companies can manage IT infrastructures while delivering enterprise-level protection without the complexity or cost. A reliable MSP/MSSP will: Deploy and manage EDR across all devices Monitor activity across all endpoints, 24/7 Respond to and mitigate threats in real-time Cybersecurity shouldn’t be a luxury reserved for large corporations. It’s now a necessity for businesses of all sizes. But many solutions need specialized security teams, making them impractical for smaller, independent companies. As cyberthreats become more and more sophisticated, partnering with an MSP/MSSP is critical in protecting your organization.Remember, your endpoints are the foundation of your businessThe companies that succeed today treat cybersecurity as seriously as sales or operations. Hackers are getting smarter, easily cracking login credentials, dodging AV software, and manipulating the devices your team depends on to get work done. That’s why endpoint protection isn’t just an IT issue. It’s a business priority.Keep in mind, your endpoints are powerful tools. They connect your team to your business, but if left unsecured, they become gateways for malicious hackers who’ll risk everything you’ve built.The super early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
