This will require increasing numbers of batteries, meaning more rare earth materials and more toxic waste once the batteries are spent. Now, WePower Technologies has an alternative. The company is avoiding the need for small batteries altogether, with energy harvesting solutions for wireless data transmitter applications. Called Gemns Energy Harvesting Generators (EHGs), the tech captures ambient energy from small actions like a button press, switch flip, or any other action and movement, rather than needing power from a battery. WePower relies on a combination of permanent and oscillating magnets to harness kinetic energy from these small movements through electromagnetic induction. This energy is then used by sensors and transmitters to send long-range, high-reliability transmissions without the need for batteries or wired power. According to the company, unlike traditional batteries, WePower’s EHGs never require maintenance, never need to be replaced, and can operate indefinitely. The company claims that its EHG can produce an energy output up to 30 times more powerful than similarly sized devices on the market, and VP of Marketing Danielle Hicks told Springwise the generators “can send up to 24 data packets in milliseconds, ensuring unmatched reliability for applications requiring real-time data transmission.” The tech could have a very wide number of uses, including in smart homes and buildings, autonomous industrial processes, consumer electronics, and aerospace markets. WePower is gearing up to bring a suite of reference products to market through strategic licensing partnerships. It’s also focused on collaborating with companies to develop custom energy harvesting solutions tailored to specific needs.
