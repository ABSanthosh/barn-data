  "text": "Immigrants are a growing force in the U.S. entrepreneurial ecosystem — one that, come January, will be operating under a second Donald Trump presidency. And the immigrant founders who spoke with Inc. have mixed feelings about that reality.  Today, multiple news outlets projected that Donald Trump won enough electoral votes to become the next president of the United States. The former president won crucial swing states like North Carolina and Georgia and broke through the Democrats’ “Blue Wall,” defeating his opponent Vice President Kamala Harris and becoming only the second president to win non-consecutive terms.  For Diego Errea, 37, a Venezuelan immigrant and the founder and president of the Tampa, Florida-based staffing and management company PPL Events, this outcome wasn’t surprising. “A lot of Hispanic populations saw it coming, and a lot of entrepreneurs, I think, saw it coming,” he says.  For Errea, that speaks to the two groups’ fears about both the economy and immigration.  Immigration, particularly at the southern border, indeed featured prominently in this election and drew voters toward Trump. Harris’s handling of the border is one of the reasons Errea himself says he felt uncertain about a Harris presidency, as well as what he deems her lack of experience.  But he says he feels a similar hesitancy about Trump’s win, citing concerns about a “consolidation of power” and the president’s rhetoric, which Errea believes can “cause friction on a worldwide stage.”   In terms of his business, Errea’s feelings are similarly mixed: he believes that under Trump, taxes could be cut — “and that’s a plus for me” — but he’s worried about the negative impacts of Trump’s proposed tariffs, which could be in the ballpark of 10 to 20 percent on all imported goods.  Magnus Larsson, the 47-year-old CEO and co-founder of the Miami-based fintech company Majority, immigrated to the U.S. three years ago from Sweden and similarly expects taxes and also regulation for entrepreneurs to become more “simplistic” under a Trump presidency.  And though his fintech business is focused on helping migrants with mobile banking, Larsson doesn’t believe a Trump presidency will impact his business, considering the strong numbers of legal immigrants living in the U.S. “I think the problems that we’re trying to solve will still be here,” Larsson says.  He’s similarly hopeful that both candidates’ warnings about the grave outcomes of the other side’s victory are overblown, and that “this will become a time for unification, instead.”  But Saadia Khan, 49, a Pakistani immigrant and the CEO and founder of Immigrantly Media — a New York City-based media company focused on telling the stories of first- and second-generation immigrants — isn’t feeling as optimistic about the outcome. While she still believes in her country, she says, Trump’s victory has left her feeling “sad,” “depressed,” and “hopeless” about the party’s “threat to democracy.”  Khan is not yet clear on what kind of impact a Trump presidency will have on her business, but she knows how it makes her feel personally as an immigrant founder: “disenfranchised,” by both parties.  “Especially for minorities and immigrants, for the longest time, Democrats took us for granted,” she says. “More than what impact it will have on my business, it’s this sense of, ‘Where do we fit in the system?… Who is going to represent us as immigrants, as minorities?’” Still, other founders — like Naveen Jain, 65, founder and CEO of the Seattle-based longevity company, Viome, and an Indian immigrant — believe entrepreneurs like himself can continue to thrive under this administration just like any other, even if he wishes the outcome of the election had been different. “I came here because America is a land of opportunity, and I believe, irrespective of who our president is, we as entrepreneurs stay focused on innovation,” Jain says. “If you go back and look at the last 100 years, presidents have come and gone. But look at the pace of innovation — it has never slowed down.”",
