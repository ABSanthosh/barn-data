  "text": "November 6, 2024 1:20 PM Image Credit: Rockstar Games Take-Two Interactive today released its quarterly earnings report for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. The company revealed details about its most popular game franchises, including that Grand Theft Auto has again performed at the top of Take-Two’s expectations. According to its report, Grand Theft Auto V has sold over 205 million units worldwide, setting the stage for its successor, Grand Theft Auto VI, which is still planned for a fall 2025 release. Two other Take-Two franchises have hit sales milestones in this quarter: Namely, Red Dead and NBA 2K. According to the report, Red Dead Redemption 2 has sold over 67 million units so far, and the company plans to see sales for the franchise increase with the launch of Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare for PC in October. On the 2K side of things, NBA 2K has also shown good numbers with the release of NBA 2K25, which has sold almost 4.5 million units since its launch at the beginning of September. The company also reports that Gearbox titles led the performance of its catalog, but didn’t offer any specific numbers. CEO Strauss Zelnick did name Borderlands 4 as one of the company’s “exciting new titles” in the pipeline. Other notes from the report indicate that Rockstar has grown its GTA+ premium subscription service, with membership growing 35% year-over-year. That said, the report also noted that Grand Theft Auto Online remained relatively flat in terms of Recurrent Consumer Spending (RCS), and is expected to decline in FY25. GB Daily Stay in the know!
