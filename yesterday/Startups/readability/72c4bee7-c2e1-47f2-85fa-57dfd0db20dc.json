And if the market wasn't tough enough, a study from Indeed earlier this year found that one in five postings on the platform required at least a four-year degree.Fortunately, there are high-earning jobs that don't require college degrees, and a Resume Genius report released this month using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics found that the median salaries for these positions can range from $67,000 to $102,420 per year.The researchers compiled the report based on two factors: The professions had to have at least $48,060 in annual salary, and have high or stable growth rates.Related: Looking for a Remote Job? Here Are the Most In-Demand Skills to Have on Your Resume, According to Employers.While the roles on the list may not require a four-year degree, some may still require apprenticeships, credentials, and years of training to achieve. \"No degree\" doesn't mean no experience, or education, at all.
