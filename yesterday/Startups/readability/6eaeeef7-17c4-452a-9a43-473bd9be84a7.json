  "text": "The PowerPoints embedded in this post are best viewed on steveblank.com We just finished the 15th\u003c\u003eannual Lean LaunchPad class at Stanford. The class had gotten so popular that in 2021 we started teaching it in both the winter and spring sessions. During the 2025 spring quarter the eight teams spoke to 935 potential customers, beneficiaries and regulators. Most students spent 15-20 hours a week on the class, about double that of a normal class. This Class Launched a Revolution in Teaching Entreprenurship This class was designed to break out of the “how to write a business plan” as the capstone of entrepreneurial education. A business plan assumed that all startups needed to was to write a plan, raise money and then execute the plan. We overturned that orthodoxy when we pointed out that while existing organizations execute business models, startups are searching for them. And that a startup was a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scaleable business model. This class was designed to teach startups how to search for a business model. Several government-funded programs have adopted this class at scale. The first was in 2011 when we turned this syllabus into the curriculum for the National Science Foundation I-Corps. Errol Arkilic, the then head of commercialization at the National Science Foundation, adopted the class saying, “You’ve developed the scientific method for startups, using the Business Model Canvas as the laboratory notebook.” Below are the Lessons Learned presentations from the spring 2025 Lean LaunchPad. Team Cowmeter – early detection of cow infections through biological monitoring of milk. If you can see the Team Cowmeter presentation click here I-Corps at the National Institute of Health In 2013 I partnered with UCSF and the National Institute of Health to offer the Lean LaunchPad class for Life Science and Healthcare (therapeutics, diagnostics, devices and digital health.) In 2014, in conjunction with the National Institute of Health, I took the UCSF curriculum and developed and launched the I-Corps @ NIH program. Team NowPilot – AI copilot for enhancing focus and executive function. If you can’t see the Team NowPilot presentation click here I-Corps at Scale I-Corps is now offered in 100 universities and has trained over 9,500 scientists and engineers; 7,800 participants in 2,546 teams at I-Corps at NSF (National Science Foundation), 950 participants in 317 teams at I-Corps at NIH, and 580 participants in 188 teams at Energy I-Corps (at the DOE).  15 universities in Japan now teach the class. Team Godela – AI physics engine – with a first disruptive market in packaging. If you can’t see the Team Godela presentation click here $4 billion in Venture Capital For I-Corps Teams 1,380 of the NSF I-Corps teams launched startups raising $3.166 billion. Over 300 I-Corps at NIH teams have collectively raised $634 million. Energy I-Corps teams raised $151 million in additional funding. Team ProspectAI – An AI sales development agent for lean sales teams. If you can’t see the Team ProspectAI presentation click here Mission Driven Entreprenurship In 2016, I co-created both the Hacking for Defense course with Pete Newell and Joe Felter as well as the Hacking for Diplomacy course with Jeremy Weinstein at Stanford. In 2022, Steve Weinstein created Hacking for Climate and Sustainability. In 2024  Jennifer Carolan launched Hacking for Education at Stanford. Team VLAB – accelerating clinical trials with AI orchestration of data. If you can’t see the team VLAB presentation click here Design of This Class While the Lean LaunchPad students are experiencing what appears to them to be a fully hands-on, experiential class, it’s a carefully designed illusion. In fact, it’s highly structured. The syllabus has been designed so that we are offering continual implicit guidance, structure, and repetition. This is a critical distinction between our class and an open-ended experiential class. Guidance, Direction and Structure – For example, students start the class with their own initial guidance – they believe they have an idea for a product or service (Lean LaunchPad/I-Corps) or have been given a clear real-world problem (Hacking for Defense). Coming into the class, students believe their goal is to validate their commercialization or deployment hypotheses. (The teaching team knows that over the course of the class, students will discover that most of their initial hypotheses are incorrect.) Team Blix – IRB clinical trial compliance / A control layer for AI governance for financial services. If you can’t see the team Blix presentation click here The Business Model Canvas The business model / mission model canvas offers students guidance, explicit direction, and structure. First, the canvas offers a complete, visual roadmap of all the hypotheses they will need to test over the entire class. Second, the canvas helps the students goal-seek by visualizing what an optimal endpoint would look like – finding product/market fit. Finally, the canvas provides students with a map of what they learn week-to-week through their customer discovery work. I can’t overemphasize the important role of the canvas. Unlike an incubator or accelerator with no frame, the canvas acts as the connective tissue – the frame – that students can fall back on if they get lost or confused. It allows us to teach the theory of how to turn an idea, need, or problem into commercial practice, week by week a piece at a time. Team Plotline – A smart marketing calendar for author’s book launch. If you can’t see the team Plotline presentation click here Lean LaunchPad Tools The tools for customer discovery (videos, sample experiments, etc.) offer guidance and structure for students to work outside the classroom. The explicit goal of 10-15 customer interviews a week along with the requirement for building a continual series of minimal viable products provides metrics that track the team’s progress. The mandatory office hours with the instructors and support from mentors provide additional guidance and structure. Team Eluna/Driftnet  – Data Center data aggregation and energy optimization software. If you can’t see the team Eluna/Driftnet presentation click here AI Embedded in the Class This was the first year where all teams used AI to help create their business model canvas, build working MVPs in hours, generate customer questions, analyze and summarizing interviews. It Takes A Village While I authored this blog post, this class is a team project. The secret sauce of the success of the Lean LaunchPad at Stanford is the extraordinary group of dedicated volunteers supporting our students in so many critical ways. The teaching team consisted of myself and: Steve Weinstein, partner at America’s Frontier Fund, 30-year veteran of Silicon Valley technology companies and Hollywood media companies. Steve was CEO of MovieLabs, the joint R\u0026D lab of all the major motion picture studios. Lee Redden – CTO and co-founder of Blue River Technology (acquired by John Deere) who was a student in the first Lean LaunchPad class 14 years ago! Jennifer Carolan, Co-Founder, Partner at Reach Capital the leading education VC and author of the Hacking for Education class. Our teaching assistants this year were Arthur C. Campello, Anil Yildiz, Abu B. Rogers and Tireni Ajilore. Mentors helped the teams understand if their solutions could be a commercially successful business. Thanks to Jillian Manus, Dave Epstein, Robert Feldman, Bobby Mukherjee, Kevin Ray, Deirdre Clute, Robert Locke, Doug Biehn, and John Danner. Martin Saywell from the Distinguished Careers Institute joined the Blix team. The mentor team was led by Todd Basche. Summary While the Lean LaunchPad/I-Corps curriculum was a revolutionary break with the past, it’s not the end. In the last decade enumerable variants have emerged. The class we teach at Stanford has continued to evolve. Better versions from others will appear. AI is already having a major impact on customer discovery and validation and we had each team list the AI tools they used. And one day another revolutionary break will take us to the next level.

It allows us to teach the theory of how to turn an idea, need, or problem into commercial practice, week by week a piece at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTeam Plotline\u003c/strong\u003e – A smart marketing calendar for author’s book launch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you can’t see the team Plotline presentation click \u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vT1DEjzzFEoAevL2AJIkhus0a0_XNLWs6igQsZpTbkd9But0MNPxl82Zqvr-R9BRQ/pub?start=false\u0026amp;loop=false\u0026amp;delayms=3000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLean LaunchPad Tools\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\nThe tools for customer discovery (videos, sample experiments, etc.) offer guidance and structure for students to work outside the classroom. The explicit goal of 10-15 customer interviews a week along with the requirement for building a continual series of minimal viable products provides metrics that track the team’s progress. The mandatory office hours with the instructors and support from mentors provide additional guidance and structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTeam Eluna/Driftnet \u003c/strong\u003e – Data Center data aggregation and energy optimization software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you can’t see the team Eluna/Driftnet presentation click \u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vR_yAMYtNdchAvTMFhLwjkhUaByjYJXGaiQ_fUCIpBjbjeczZBrKMt3hv0AVGF3gw/pub?start=false\u0026amp;loop=false\u0026amp;delayms=3000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAI Embedded in the Class\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eThis was the first year where all teams used AI to help create their business model canvas, build working MVPs in hours, generate customer questions, analyze and summarizing interviews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt Takes A Village\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eWhile I authored this blog post, this class is a team project.
