  "text": "OpenAI has launched Operator, an AI-powered agent capable of using its own browser to perform a variety of tasks for users. Operator, available as a research preview to Pro users in the United States, represents a step forward in AI’s ability to handle repetitive and time-consuming browser tasks independently.Operator leverages a new model, Computer-Using Agent (CUA), which combines GPT-4o’s vision capabilities with advanced reasoning through reinforcement learning. This allows the agent to interact with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as buttons, menus, and text fields—essentially mimicking how a human interacts with a browser.Tasks Operator can perform include filling out forms, ordering groceries, and even creating memes. By navigating websites and performing actions like typing, clicking, and scrolling, Operator broadens the utility of AI in everyday activities and business workflows.“Operator is one of our first agents, which are AIs capable of doing work for you independently—you give it a task and it will execute it,” OpenAI stated in its release. The tool’s introduction is intended to save time for users while opening up new opportunities for businesses to enhance engagement and efficiency.Operator is designed to “see” through screenshots and “interact” using the actions of a mouse and keyboard. If it encounters challenges or makes errors, it can self-correct using its reasoning capabilities or hand control back to the user. This collaborative approach ensures users remain in control throughout the process.The system excels at repetitive tasks but is still in development. Early feedback will be used to address limitations, such as challenges with complex interfaces like slideshow creation or calendar management.Operator includes multiple safeguards to prioritize user safety and privacy:Takeover Mode: The agent asks users to take control when entering sensitive information, such as login credentials or payment details, ensuring Operator does not collect this data.User Confirmations: Operator requires user approval before finalizing significant actions like submitting orders or sending emails.Task Limitations: The system is trained to decline sensitive tasks, such as high-stakes decisions or banking transactions.OpenAI has also integrated robust privacy measures, including options to delete browsing data, opt out of data training, and monitor Operator’s actions through a dedicated “monitor model” that flags suspicious behavior.Operator is already collaborating with companies like DoorDash, Instacart, and Priceline to streamline tasks and improve customer experiences. OpenAI is also exploring public sector applications, partnering with organizations like the City of Stockton to enhance accessibility for enrolling in city services.What’s Next for OperatorOpenAI plans to expand Operator to Plus, Team, and Enterprise users in the future, integrating its capabilities directly into ChatGPT. Additionally, the company intends to expose the CUA model powering Operator in its API, allowing developers to create their own computer-using agents.Image: OpenAIEditor's Picks Joshua Sophy is the Editor for Small Business Trends and has been a member of the team for 16 years.
