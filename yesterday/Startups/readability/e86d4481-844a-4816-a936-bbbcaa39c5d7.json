  "text": "February 16, 2025 3:00 PM ThecePlay and Logitech G have teamed up to launch Aim \u0026 Run, a high-intensity speedrun challenge where anyone can be the best player in a Counter-Strike 2 map. ThecePlay has created a speedrun test in a Counter-Strike 2 mod where a player moves through a maze quickly and has to precisely shoot a bunch of dummy enemies. Whoever can shoot most accurately and quickly moves to the top of the leaderboard. Logitech G is launching Aim \u0026 Run, a high-intensity speedrun challenge designed to push precision and speed to their limits. Aim \u0026 Run is the latest asynchronous individual competition powered by ThecePlay.  The ThecePlay platform provides brands, publishers, organizations, and individual players with the opportunity to participate in large-scale, verified competitive gaming—all backed by the Twin Galaxies adjudication system, a globally trusted standard for performance verification. In Aim \u0026 Run, you have to shoot bad guys and get through the course as fast as possible. ThecePlay is the brainchild of Zachary Rozga, CEO of Thece, and Jace Hall, CEO of Twin Galaxies. Thece brings its expertise in creating authentic and engaging gaming experiences to the challenge. To guarantee the competition’s integrity, ThecePlay is powered by Twin Galaxies, the most respected video game player achievement organization. Twin Galaxies has over 40 years of experience adjudicating and verifying gaming accomplishments. This combination of Thece’s platform and Twin Galaxies’ credibility elevates winners’ achievements and provides a fair and exciting experience for all participants. The aim of ThecePlay isn’t just to celebrate esports stars. It’s about celebrating the achievements of ordinary gamers and surfacing the people who should be the next stars. “This is going to be huge,” Hall said. “It’s a killer app. This is not just a sales and marketing thing. They want to do a speedrun in Counter-Strike 2 with a custom map that Logitech G created.” Amateurs and esports pros can compete in Aim \u0026 Run from Logitech G. Any competitor from around the world can submit their fastest completion times and secure a spot on the official leaderboard. While participation is open globally, only players in eligible European territories will qualify for prizes. The top 50 verified submissions will win high-performance Logitech G gear, including: 24K gold Pro X Superlight 2 Dex mouse (ultra-rare, collector’s edition). Pro X TKL keyboard (designed for competitive play) Pro X 2 Lightspeed headset (engineered for precision audio A competition that bridges everyday players and esports pros ThecePlay and Logitech G have created a speedrun game dubbed Aim \u0026 Run. Aim \u0026 Run introduces a format where the gaming public and professional esports athletes can compete on the same leaderboard. This structure allows players to measure their performance against elite competitors while engaging in a fully verified and transparent public challenge. In addition to leaderboard rankings, Logitech G is introducing special challenge-based incentives: Webcam Challenge: Participants who submit a video of their face or hands using a Logitech G mouse or keyboard will receive a Pro X Lightspeed headset if their submission ranks among the Top 50. 8.88 Challenge: The first five verified runs with a final time ending in 8.88 seconds will win a Pro X Superlight 2 mouse, featuring an 8K polling rate and 888 IPS for exceptional precision. Competition details and entry process ThecePlay dreamed up a way to let everyone compete in the same competitions. Visit: www.aimandrun.gg Objective: Achieve the fastest completion time on the official Aim \u0026 Run Prefire Map. Platform: PC (Windows or Linux) Eligibility: Open globally; prizes available only in select European countries. Deadline: March 9, 2025, at 11:59 p.m. CET (2:59 p.m. Pacific time). Submission: Participants must upload a video of their speedrun and submit their final time via the official entry form. Multiple submissions are allowed, but only the highest verified score will be recorded. All submissions undergo thorough review, leveraging established methodologies to uphold integrity and competitive standards. Participants can also contribute to the verification process, earning submission points by reviewing other entries, reinforcing a peer-driven approach to competition fairness. Aim \u0026 Run represents the next evolution of precision-based gaming challenges, bringing together enterprise gaming technology, professional esports athletes, influencers, and a global player base. More details, including the official map download and submission process, can be found at www.aimandrun.gg. ThecePlay wants to surface the best players through gaming competitions. Founded in 1981, Twin Galaxies was made famous by the film King of Kong, about the rivalry between two men to be the best in the world at playing the Donkey Kong. Twin Galaxies adjudicated the high scores in the grudge match between Billy Mitchell and Steve Wiebe. Hall bought the company nearly 11 years ago. The company now has referee technology like anti-cheat, and its proprietary TGSAP system ensure accuracy in verifying competitive gaming records. Hall said it took about 10 years to be able to process the competitions and build the right platform. “Look, as a gamer, this mechanism is very appealing to me because as you apply to all the different games, you’re going to get one of your favorite games and you’re going to want to compete against everybody. It’s like going into the arcade where everybody’s standing around then you pop your quarter in you’re getting the high score. Now, instead of 20 people, it can be 200,000 people watching you.” Hall said the system can handle it if tons of people participate in the contests. Each contest can be set up fairly quickly by ThecePlay. Then it’s a function of servers and money to scale up the contest. GamesBeat may test the waters with our own contest of some kind. More to come on that. How the deal came about Jace Hall is CEO of Twin Galaxies. Hall said that Logitech G in Europe evaluated what Thece and Twin Galaxies were doing with ThecePlay. It’s simple in that it only tests for aiming and running at the same time. It can be measured exactly the same for everyone who plays it, Hall said. What’s cool about the competition is that it can be asynchronous, it’s verified, and competitors can see the rankings change in real time on the leaderboard. Thanks to Twin Galaxies, the participants know that no one is cheating. And esports team pros are going to participate in the event. “This unlocks the ability to do competitions and deliver our message,” Hall said. “They want to promote the crap out of it.” One of the cool things is the speedrun community has become huge and there are people who play first-person shooter games just to do speedruns, Hall said. Based on the competition, Logitech will be able to officially name its first “aim god,” he said. “They’re masters at aim, masters at running,” he said. “Effectively this creates a way for the public to play directly head-to-head on an individual basis in a public forum against esports pros. That’s never even been possible. This is a cataclysmic collision of worlds in a hugely popular game.” Next steps Zachary Rozga is CEO of Thece. Logitech G will promote the contest with paid media and a number of Counter-Strike esports teams will participate, Rozga said. Logitech G will promote the event on its web site. And after a few weeks, it will determine the winners and give out prizes. Hall hopes it will be a huge competition, as it’s a competition for individuals, rather than teams as with most Counter-Strike matches. “Everyone is going to discover ThecePlay for the first time,” Hall said. In the map, the game won’t let you progress until you’ve eliminated all the enemies in a room, and then it leads you to the next room. You can play the game repeatedly until you get a high score and then you can upload it. When you submit, you can say what country you’re from. “This competition is not designed to replace other ones or esports events. There is an enormous section of our industry has been unserved because there just hasn’t been a way to do it. Ultimately, underneath all of this is Twin Galaxy’s system authenticating the truthfulness of an entry.” There are other types of competitions that can be created, where players compete asynchronously from home, and it can happen across a number of games or game companies, Rozga said. “”The more you use it, the bigger it becomes,” Hall said. It’s the idea of being able to democratize the gameplay for these competitions. Now we can let a larger group of people participate.” Daily insights on business use cases with VB Daily If you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

It’s like going into the arcade where everybody’s standing around then you pop your quarter in you’re getting the high score. Now, instead of 20 people, it can be 200,000 people watching you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHall said the system can handle it if tons of people participate in the contests. Each contest can be set up fairly quickly by ThecePlay. Then it’s a function of servers and money to scale up the contest. GamesBeat may test the waters with our own contest of some kind.

It can be measured exactly the same for everyone who plays it, Hall said. What’s cool about the competition is that it can be asynchronous, it’s verified, and competitors can see the rankings change in real time on the leaderboard. Thanks to Twin Galaxies, the participants know that no one is cheating. And esports team pros are going to participate in the event. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“This unlocks the ability to do competitions and deliver our message,” Hall said. “They want to promote the crap out of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the cool things is the speedrun community has become huge and there are people who play first-person shooter games just to do speedruns, Hall said.
