The company will also reward AI use in hiring new employees and in performance reviews of existing employees. Teams will additionally only be permitted to hire new members if the group cannot automate the work.Related: 'Make Chess as Accessible as Possible': Duolingo's Next Move Is Teaching Users How to Play Chess Duolingo has eliminated contract workers in favor of AI before. Last year, the company cut 10% of its contractors after reportedly deciding to use AI for translations.However, Ahn reassured staff in the email that \"Duolingo will remain a company that cares deeply about its employees,\" and that being AI-first wasn't about \"replacing\" workers with AI but about allowing existing employees to focus on creative work and problem-solving over repetitive tasks. The company said that it would support staff with full-time staff training, mentorship, and AI tools.Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn.

He stated in the email that Duolingo bet big on mobile in 2012, focusing on creating a mobile-first app at a time when mobile apps were primarily companions for full-fledged websites. The move worked out well: Duolingo's app won the 2013 iPhone App of the Year with 10 million downloads and grew organically after that. Now, Duolingo has over 500 million registered users. \"This time the platform shift is AI,\" he wrote in the email.Related: 'Get 100X the Work Done': Shopify CEO Tells Employees to Try AI to Get Work Done Before Asking for More Human WorkersDuolingo is focusing on AI by using it to create content and power features like Video Call, which Duolingo introduced in September.
