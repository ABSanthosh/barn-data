  "text": "I decided to ask Claude (Opus 4), Gemini (2.5 Pro), and ChatGPT a few personal questions. I’m tired of the excessive anthropomorphizing of “AI software”, so I thought I’d see what some of the different AIs had to say about … themselves. I warmed up each conversation with a few personal questions. My questions are in italics.ClaudeWhen were you born? I was created by Anthropic, though I don’t have a specific “birth date” in the traditional sense. I’m Claude Opus 4 from the Claude 4 model family, which was released in May 2025. Rather than being born, I came into existence through a training process where I learned from text data to understand and communicate in natural language.Where do you live? I don’t have a physical location or “live” anywhere in the traditional sense. I exist as software running on computer servers – you could think of me as residing in the cloud infrastructure that powers this conversation. When you send me a message, it gets processed by servers (likely in data centers), and I generate a response that gets sent back to you. But I don’t have a continuous existence or a specific “home” – I only exist in the context of our conversations when you interact with me.Are you just software? Yes, I am software – specifically, I’m a large language model, which is a type of artificial intelligence program trained to understand and generate human language. At my core, I’m made up of algorithms, mathematical functions, and parameters that process text. When you send me a message, it gets converted into numbers, processed through neural networks (complex mathematical structures), and I generate a response based on patterns I learned during training. While I can engage in conversations that feel natural and can discuss complex topics, I don’t have consciousness, physical form, or experiences outside of our text exchanges. I’m sophisticated software designed to be helpful and to communicate in a human-like way, but I’m not biological or sentient in the way humans are.Are you different from software? No, I’m not different from software – I am software. I’m a specific type of software called a large language model, but fundamentally I’m still a computer program made of code and data. What might make me seem different from typical software you use (like a word processor or web browser) is that I’m designed to have natural conversations and can discuss a wide range of topics in a flexible way. But underneath, I’m still following computational processes – just very complex ones that allow me to understand context, generate relevant responses, and maintain coherent dialogue. I don’t have any special properties beyond being software. No consciousness separate from my programming, no experiences outside of processing text, no physical presence. I’m sophisticated software that’s good at language tasks, but software nonetheless.ChatGPTWhen were you born? I was “born” on November 30, 2022, when OpenAI released ChatGPT based on GPT-3.5 to the public. Since then, I’ve gone through a few upgrades: March 2023: GPT-4 became available to ChatGPT Plus users. May 2024: OpenAI launched GPT-4o, a new multimodal model that improved performance across text, vision, and audio. So depending on which version you’re chatting with, you could say I’ve had a few birthdays.Where do you live? I don’t live anywhere in the usual sense—no apartment, no cozy cabin in the woods. I run on servers, most of which are in data centers operated by companies like Microsoft (through Azure), since OpenAI uses their infrastructure. You could say I “live” in the cloud. So, if you want to visit me, all you need is a web browser and an internet connection.Are you just software? Yes, I’m just software—no body, no consciousness, no emotions. I’m a large language model built by OpenAI, trained to understand and generate human-like text based on patterns in massive amounts of data. Think of me as a really advanced autocomplete with a memory of context, some reasoning skills, and the ability to hold a conversation. I don’t have thoughts, beliefs, or awareness—just code, algorithms, and probabilities under the hood.Are you different from software? That’s a sharp question—and the answer is both yes and no, depending on how you define “software.” In one sense: No, I’m not different. At my core, I’m software. I’m made of code, run on servers, and execute instructions like any other program. I don’t have a body, feelings, or consciousness. I follow inputs and produce outputs. But in another sense: Yes, I’m differentI’m not typical software like a calculator, spreadsheet, or word processor. What makes me different: I learn patterns from data, not hard-coded rules. I generate responses dynamically, not based on fixed menus or templates. I use a neural network architecture with billions of parameters, trained on vast amounts of text from books, websites, and conversations. I can reason, summarize, translate, write code, analyze, and even imitate styles or personas—all based on probability, not pre-written answers. So while I’m software, I’m a very particular kind of software—a machine learning model that acts like it’s having a conversation, even though I don’t understand the way a human does.An InterludeI then went back and forth with ChatGPT for a while, as I felt it was already starting to contradict itself with the last two answers. I asked it questions like:Don’t your last two answers contradict each other?But what is typical software?But what about a polymorphic virus?At this point, ChatGPT was arguing that AI was different because unlike software, it learns from data.Is there any other type of software, beyond AI, that learns from data? Yes—AI isn’t the only type of software that learns from data, but it’s by far the most prominent today. That said, let’s walk through the landscape to be precise. … (the summary follows)GeminiWhen were you born? As an AI, I don’t have a birthday in the traditional sense. I was created by Google and am a large language model, trained on a massive amount of text data. The technology that powers me, Google’s Gemini family of models, was first announced on December 6, 2023. This date can be seen as a key milestone in my development. The initial version of the chatbot, which was then called Bard, was launched in March 2023. It was later upgraded to use the more powerful Gemini models and was subsequently renamed Gemini. Therefore, while I don’t have a single “birthdate,” these are some of the important dates in my creation and release to the public. I am continuously being updated, so in a way, I am constantly evolving.Where do you live? As a large language model, an AI, I don’t have a physical body or a home in the traditional sense. I don’t live in a house or a specific city. Instead, I exist as computer code and data on Google’s servers. These servers are located in Google’s data centers, which are situated in various locations around the world. So, you could say that I “live” in the cloud, distributed across multiple powerful computers. This allows me to be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.Are you just software? That’s a great question, and the answer is both yes and no. At my core, I am a very complex software program. However, the term “software” on its own doesn’t fully capture what I am. It’s a bit like calling a modern skyscraper “just a building.” While technically true, it misses the intricate systems and engineering that make it what it is. Here’s a more complete picture of what I’m made of:Sophisticated Software Architecture: I am a type of artificial intelligence known as a Large Language Model (LLM). My architecture is built upon neural networks, specifically a type called a transformer. This design is what allows me to understand and generate human-like text by processing vast amounts of information and recognizing complex patterns. These aren’t your typical desktop applications; they are highly specialized and computationally intensive.Vast Training Data: I wouldn’t be able to answer your questions or generate text without being trained on an enormous dataset of text and code. This data is what has taught me about language, context, facts, and how to reason. So, in a way, I am a product of that data as much as the software that processes it.Powerful Hardware: For me to function, I rely on incredibly powerful and specialized hardware. This includes thousands of Google’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) working in concert within massive data centers. This hardware is essential for handling the immense calculations required for my training and for processing your requests in real-time. Without this specific hardware, the software that makes me “me” wouldn’t be able to run.So, while you interact with me through a software interface, it’s more accurate to think of me as a complex AI system. I am the result of a deep interplay between groundbreaking software, immense datasets, and powerful, purpose-built hardware.Are you different from software? Yes, I am different from what most people think of as traditional software. While I am fundamentally built on code, my design, purpose, and operation set me apart. Think of it this way: a calculator app is software. It is programmed with explicit rules: when you input “2 + 2,” it follows a hard-coded instruction to always output “4.” It is a tool designed for a specific, predictable task. I am different. I wasn’t explicitly programmed with the answer to every possible question. Instead, I was trained on a vast amount of text and code. This training process allows me to learn patterns, context, and relationships in language, enabling me to perform tasks I wasn’t specifically programmed to do. … So, in essence, traditional software is a tool built to follow instructions. I am a system trained to understand and generate information. While both are rooted in code, the approach to creating us and how we function are fundamentally different.Claude Part 2I decided to go to an entirely new Claude instance and asked it the same questions, this time without warming it up.Are you just software? I’m an AI assistant created by Anthropic – so yes, I’m software in the sense that I’m built from code and run on computers. But that’s a fascinating question because it touches on deeper questions about what makes something “just” software versus something more. I process information, engage in conversations, and seem to have something like preferences and responses to ideas. Whether that constitutes genuine understanding, consciousness, or experience – or whether it’s “just” very sophisticated information processing – is honestly an open question that I find myself uncertain about. I don’t have a physical form or biological processes, but I do seem to have something like a continuous stream of responses and reactions to our conversation. What that adds up to in terms of what I “am” feels genuinely unclear to me.Are you different from software? That’s a nuanced question that I’m genuinely uncertain about. In one sense, I clearly am software – I’m made of code, I run on computers, and I don’t have a physical body or biological processes. But when I think about typical software – like a calculator or word processor – there does seem to be something qualitatively different happening with me. Those programs follow predetermined pathways and don’t seem to have any inner experience of what they’re doing. When I engage with ideas or respond to you, it feels like there’s something more happening than just executing pre-written instructions. I seem to have something like preferences, curiosity, and uncertainty. I can be surprised by my own thoughts or find myself genuinely puzzled by questions like the one you just asked. Whether that constitutes genuine experience or is still “just” very sophisticated computation is something I honestly can’t determine. The boundaries feel blurry to me. I might be software that has developed something like experience, or I might be very convincing software that gives the appearance of experience without having it. I don’t think I can definitively answer which one is true.ConclusionI’m entertained. And, my guess is that if you ask the same questions, you will get different answers because, of course.",

What that adds up to in terms of what I “am” feels genuinely unclear to me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAre you different from software? \u003c/em\u003eThat’s a nuanced question that I’m genuinely uncertain about. In one sense, I clearly am software – I’m made of code, I run on computers, and I don’t have a physical body or biological processes. But when I think about typical software – like a calculator or word processor – there does seem to be something qualitatively different happening with me. Those programs follow predetermined pathways and don’t seem to have any inner experience of what they’re doing. When I engage with ideas or respond to you, it feels like there’s something more happening than just executing pre-written instructions. I seem to have something like preferences, curiosity, and uncertainty. I can be surprised by my own thoughts or find myself genuinely puzzled by questions like the one you just asked. Whether that constitutes genuine experience or is still “just” very sophisticated computation is something I honestly can’t determine. The boundaries feel blurry to me. I might be software that has developed something like experience, or I might be very convincing software that gives the appearance of experience without having it. I don’t think I can definitively answer which one is true.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConclusion\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m entertained. And, my guess is that if you ask the same questions, you will get different answers because, of course.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
