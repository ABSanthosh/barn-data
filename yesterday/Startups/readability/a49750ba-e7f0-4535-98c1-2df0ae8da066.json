  "text": "January 16, 2025 4:02 PM God of War: RagnarokImage Credit: GamesBeat/Rachel Kaser Sony appears to be reversing course hard on its live service ambitions, at least according to a new report from Bloomberg. The report says that PlayStation has now canceled two more live-service titles, one from Bend Studio and the other from Bluepoint Games. While there’s no official word on what these games were — neither company had announced a game in development — Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier claims that one of the titles was set in the God of War universe. The games company announced shortly after its acquisition of Bungie that it intended to launch a dozen-or-so live-service titles before the end of the 2025 fiscal year. However, this has been fraught with difficulties, with turmoil behind the scenes at Bungie itself, and several major live-service games either failing to launch or making mediocre showings post-launch. The most infamous of these is 2024’s Concord, which launched and subsequently died within two weeks. While Helldivers 2 has proven to be a success, it has proven an anomaly in PlayStation’s ambitions. Sony acquired Bluepoint in 2021, having previously worked with the studio to develop remakes and remasters, including Demon’s Souls and Shadow of the Colossus. An IGN report from around that time claimed that Bluepoint’s next title would be an original one. As for Bend, former Days Gone director Jeff Ross (Bend Studio published Days Gone) alleged that Sony had invested $250 million on its next project. According to the report, Sony has not closed either studio and doesn’t plan to lay off any staff. A memo to staff says the company is “working closely with Bend and Bluepoint to determine what are the next projects and plan to do everything we can to ensure there is minimal business impact.” GB Daily Stay in the know!
