Video lets you broadcast your message, boost your brand and have a larger impact on your audience.Another obvious reason why video content marketing remains one of the most effective marketing tools is simplicity.Below are some of the different types of marketing videos you can use for your outreach.Customer Testimonial VideoCustomers can be great ambassadors for your brand, product or service. If you can find an existing customer willing to go on video, then, by all means, get them in your video.They can make a great impression on other customers who are on the fence to help explain the intricacies of your product or services through the lens of a user or customer.For greater success let customers use their own words but ask them to be specific. Potential customers might not be as convinced from your pitch but when a fellow customer who they can relate to recommends your products their skepticism might go down.How-To VideoAlso known as instructional videos, tutorials or Do it Yourself (DIY), they let viewers find solutions to a particular problem they might be experiencing. They are a great way to help viewers take a step by step walkthrough a process.Essentially these videos assist viewers to answer questions and instruct them on how to do something they didn’t know how to go about doing.According to Google, a how-to- video earns the most attention of any content category on YouTube; more than music clips or gaming.In fact, more than 7 in 10 viewers of the 2 billion monthly active YouTube users use YouTube to solve problems. It is also a great way to use your video content to help others.Demo VideoA demonstration video is a great way to showcase the attributes of your product or services because they work well for marketing campaigns.To further enhance your message, you can also incorporate animation, images, and infographics to help the audience get a better feel of your offering.A demo video is literally a walk-through of your offering much like you would do when a customer drops by to your shop or office. Eight out of ten people have purchased a piece of software or application after watching a brand’s video.Product Review VideoA product review video is meant to give a particular product or service an edge against the competition’s offering. By first showing the benefits of your product or service, you can assist customers to get a better understanding of what they are signing up for if they choose you.Product reviews are great in providing information on the highlights of the product or service. This helps customers go one step closer to make a purchase.  A review video is also a great tool for building trust with viewers as well.Webinar VideoA webinar is an online event where speakers deliver presentations, educational series or conferences to an audience.Often participants interact with the speakers by submitting questions, responding to polls and other exchanges.

Often an interview video is accompanied by a transcript of the interview so that people can also read as well as watch.YouTube automatically generates a transcript, albeit sometimes rough. This type of video is good for sharing your company’s values and its solidarity with the community or causes.Training VideoAlso used interchangeably as tutorial videos, they help improve the user’s skills with a particular product. These videos can use footage of real people to connect the trainer with the user. The video can be step-by-step instructions on how to use or optimize the item they purchased.If you want to create your own training video, you can record a short screencast showing you doing the activity and explaining the process.Tools like Techsmith, Loom and TinyTake by Mango Apps are great for this purpose.

The Food Network is a treasure trove of easy to make recipes that anyone can follow. Google, Facebook and other online tools are also great resources for finding every imaginable recipe.Videos from PhotographsThese are straightforward videos that are more like slideshows.

Your personalized business message video needs to incorporate some or all of the following: create awareness; spark interests; and initiate desire and action.A simple personalization can just include a video message addressing the customer interest or pain point. A well-made personal message video can help improve sales conversions, build trust and encourages leads.Video Marketing: A Step-by-Step GuideEmbarking on a video marketing journey can seem daunting, but with this systematic guide, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge and strategies to navigate this dynamic medium with confidence. Understanding the video creation process is crucial for developing an effective video marketing strategy, as it involves defining goals and planning to ensure alignment with marketing objectives.Step 1. Determine the Video PurposeThe most important thing that goes into making a successful video first hinges on your passion and creativity to tell a story. Before starting to shoot, you should ask yourself what you want the audience to get out of your content.In fact best practices advise us to answer three core questions: What problems does the video content will solve?; How will your video content support your wider company’s goals: and what will be the outcomes and results that measure success?Best practices also advise us to think about your Unique Selling Proposition (USP), which helps identify how you as a business stand out from the competition.Simply put, describe the distinct benefit your users gain only by buying from your company, which is essentially your video marketing strategy.It is why your business is capable of drawing attention, distinguishing itself from the competition, winning prospects and garner customer loyalty.This is the canvas on which you draw all your messages. Incorporating the good things you’ve heard customers say about your business can further help enhance your messaging.Video Purpose:What problems does the video content solve?How will your video content support your wider company’s goals?What will be the outcomes and results that measure success?Step 2. Write a ScriptA great script will help deliver the outcome you desire from your marketing video. Good video production is essential, but just as important, a good script is a cornerstone of the content when you create your video.Writing a good script requires solid research and an understanding of your viewers’ interest. Make it a best-practice to write a well researched, simple and clear script before you shoot any video.The script should help your video get attention; be memorable; be compelling and persuasive enough to get people to consider your proposition.Ask yourself what is it that I want to convey? In response don’t confuse your audience as to the purpose of the video is and what you want them to do after watching the video. Do you want them to come and visit your store or do you want them to try out and start using your product?At the end of the day, is the goal to visit your website for more information, your Facebook page, or sign up for your newsletter?The foundation of any video is the script and storyboard. You can take inspiration by first benchmarking videos that have impressed you and seek ways how to emulate them to serve your purpose.Look at your competitors’ messaging and see if you can out-tell a better story. Find new ways to create and deliver the information your users want.Start thinking about how you can turn the most unusual attributes of your business into unique benefits for users. With any video production, you might be tempted to go overboard. The key here is to know your objective and stay on point.You can incorporate photos, music, and animations to spruce up your production as well.Video Goals:To get attentionTo be memorableTo be compelling and persuasiveTo guide viewers to a specific action (e.g., visit your store, try your product, visit your website)Step 3. Identify Tools and Gear You NeedIf you have a camera, a webcam, or a decent cell phone that can take video then you are on to a good start. Your phone can get you started to create a live video on Instagram or Facebook or even record entire videos and edit them.If you want to go all-in, you will need a good DSLR camera, tripods, lenses, audio recorders and other accessories to create the professional-looking crisp production.You can first start by using your camera slowly and gradually, through reading up and research, you can use advanced features to get more of a professional look.Beyond the hardware, you will need good video editing software that can help enhance your production. Professional-grade equipment and software can be expensive and might not be feasible for small businesses and individuals.If you have space to spare you can also set up your own studio where you can shoot videos and record audio. Your studio doesn’t have to be expensive full of fancy equipment.All you need is a dedicated room that is soundproof and has a good background so you can start. You can easily set up a filming space in your office without incurring a lot of costs.Equipment:For those diving into video marketing, understanding the foundational gear is crucial; below is a table detailing key equipment to elevate your production quality.Camera, webcam, or cell phoneDSLR camera, tripods, lensesAudio recordersVideo editing softwareCategoryBeginnerIntermediateProfessionalCameraCell phoneWebcamDSLR CameraStabilityHandheldSimple tripodProfessional tripodAudioPhone's microphoneExternal micAudio recordersEditingiMovie/Windows Movie MakerBasic paid softwareAdobe Premiere Pro/Final Cut ProStep 4. Set Up the Camera, Webcam, or Video ToolMake sure the subject is placed centered on the preview screen. Also, try not to go too close or too far away from the subject to not disorient viewers. If you plan on recording sound make sure to test the audio and it is audible and there is no background noise that might cause disruptions.Another important thing to remember is to ensure your camera is firmly stationed on a tripod or another device so your video does not come out shaky.Step 5. Adjust the LightingLighting is an important aspect of the shoot. Your lighting should not be too bright or dark. If possible, record in a location with as much natural light as possible.Strong light behind the subject can distort your video and might turn the subject into a silhouette.Seek shade when filming outdoors in harsh sunlight for the best video lighting. Try to shoot with the light source positioned at the back of the camera. You can also use a desk light or another light source if the lighting is too weak.While indoors, make sure the window is generally in front of you when filming. This will give you balanced lighting.Lighting Do’s and Don’ts:Avoid too-bright or too-dark lightingUse natural light when possibleDon’t place a strong light behind the subjectUse desk lights if necessaryStep 6. Record the VideoIf you don’t have the budget to invest in a camera you can use a smartphone. Today’s new smartphones come with amazing cameras and can work well for on-the-go shooting.Just find an elevated place to position the camera or a tripod (more on this coming up) and start filming. A webcam can also be good to create personal messages and video blogs.For webcams, make sure to look at the camera lens while you’re recording. Keep this in mind when you see yourself on-screen, as your eyes won’t be directed at viewers.It is best that you hold your camera in landscape orientation, not portrait, for a good shoot. Make sure you have a nice background and it doesn’t distract you.Many videos are plagued by stuff that shows up in the background and if it is not the right thing, again it will distract from the message and your overall content.Nice backgrounds can set the scene and tone for your videos. If it is a personal message may be a bookshelf and awards can give it that professional ambiance.However, if all fails, a simple backdrop can help eliminate clutter for more professional-looking videos.If you don’t have a microphone, instead of purchasing a new one, you can use subtitles to tell your story while playing music in the background.Points to remember:Use a landscape orientationEnsure a good backgroundMinimize distractions in the backgroundConsider using subtitles if no microphone is availableStep 7. Edit the VideoEditing is where you add some panache to your productions. It might be daunting at first, but you can use freeware editing software such as iMovie or Windows Movie Maker to get you started. Video marketers play a crucial role in the editing phase, optimizing footage to enhance ROI, SEO, and customer engagement.If you want professional features, you can go with Adobe Premiere Pro or Apple Final Cut Pro.You can also look for programs that allow you to do basic editing. Videos can take a lot of storage space so make sure you invest in external hard disk or have the option to save them in the cloud. You can look to Google drive, Dropbox or Microsoft OneDrive.Step 8. Upload Your VideoAfter shooting and editing, you will need to decide on how to reach out to your audience. How you share and which platforms you choose will largely depend on your target audience and your video marketing goals.For example, if you are doing a how-to-video your best bet would be to upload it on YouTube. If you are targeting younger audiences you might opt for Snapchat or Instagram.It is always best to first start with one channel in mind and then re-purpose the video to suit other channels in the future.Step 9. Optimize the Video PageThe key to your video strategy is to get views. For this, you will need your videos to be indexed and ranked for search engine results pages.  First off, you will need to choose the right video hosting platform.If you are focused on general brand awareness, you might opt to use platforms like YouTube and Vimeo. This will increase your chances of reaching a large viewership for your videos.However, this could affect traffic coming to your website as by posting on these platforms you lose out in directing traffic to your website. If you are looking to get traffic you can direct it to your website by including a call to action calling for viewers to visit your site.Search Engine Optimization (SEO) comes into play here as well. SEO involves making certain tweaks to your website design and content that will make content more attractive to search engines.Using SEO will help make sure your content ranks high in the search engines. Thus enabling users both new and old to easily get access to your content.Key aspects of video optimization:Selecting the right hosting platformInserting a video transcript for SEOCrafting a compelling title and descriptionUsing an attractive thumbnailPromoting through social media and influencersOptimization ToolsBy first inserting a video transcript, this can help with SEO. This will allow search bots to scrape more of your content as you have an indexable text accompanying your video, raising the chances of you going up the search index.Similarly, your title and description of the video can further your SEO effort by increasing your chances of being viewed.Make sure you have an attractive thumbnail. Video thumbnails are what searchers will see when your video is indexed. Using visually interesting thumbnails for your video content helps to attract more viewers and increase watch time for your videos.This will determine whether they click on your video or not. You should think about your thumbnail as the cover of your video. It should be enticing enough to warrant a click.Creating great video content is important, equally important is to make sure your video resonates with the target audience. In this regard, SEO is an effective way of boosting your discoverability and get you on the first page of Google.In addition to SEO tweaking, you should also do your bit in terms of directing people to find and see your videos. Call on your social media followers and e-mail subscribers to let them know and see your video. You can also work with influencers to get people to know more about your video.Step 10. Measure ResultsIf you can’t measure it you can’t manage it. The key to your marketing videos is seeing some form of positive action(s) coming from your audience.Your investments in the production can only be measured based on the positive responses you garner from viewers.If you spent a lot of money on a high-end production only to garner just a handful of views you might not be making the connections or have failed to really reach out to people.Your website’s analytics and metrics are important tools for assessing what impact your videos are having in terms of visitors and conversions to your website. Google Analytics can provide data on search inquiries and traffic and behavior.There are other online tools to measure and quantify the level of visitors for blogs, posts, social media conversations, and Tweets.Most social media platforms including Facebook, Vimeo, YouTube come with their own analytics to track the performance of your videos and video marketing campaign.If you want to independently track the impact of your videos there are essentially five ways of measuring your video marketing endeavor. They are view count, play rate, watch rate, click-through rate and conversion rate.View count is the number of times your video has been viewedPlay rate is the comparison of the number of people who watched your video compared to the number of people who had the opportunity to watch itWatch rate measures how much of your video people actually watch. Are people hitting play only to hit pause before they reach the meat of your content?Click-through rate is the percentage of viewers who click on your video’s call to action and visit another pageConversion rate measures what percentage of video viewers become your customersVideo Marketing FAQsThe following frequently asked questions may provide additional answers:What is a video marketing strategy?Simply put it is the blueprint that outlines what you want to achieve with marketing with videos; who you are targeting and how you will measure your success.This requires you to set goals for your video; identify target audiences; what you want to tell them; be both entertaining and engaging enough, and of course have a realistic budget.How Can Small Businesses Maximize ROI with Video Marketing?Small businesses can maximize their return on investment (ROI) in video marketing by focusing on content that resonates with their target audience. Start with understanding your customers’ needs and preferences, and create videos that provide solutions, education, or entertainment. Utilizing social media platforms for distribution can amplify reach without significant costs. Also, tracking engagement metrics and feedback can help refine future content for better results. Collaborative efforts with influencers or community members can also enhance content impact without a large budget. Remember, consistency and relevance are key to building a loyal viewer base and boosting ROI.Is High-Quality Equipment Essential for Effective Video Marketing?While high-quality equipment can enhance video production, it’s not essential for effective video marketing. Today, smartphones are capable of capturing high-quality footage suitable for online platforms. The focus should be on content quality rather than just technical quality. Engaging storytelling, clear messaging, and relevance to the target audience are more crucial. Businesses can invest in basic editing software to polish videos. Remember, authenticity often trumps high production values in digital marketing. User-generated content, live streams, and simple yet insightful videos can be highly effective, especially for small businesses with limited budgets.How Much Does Video Marketing Cost?Video marketing does not necessarily have to cost a lot. It depends on what you want to produce, the level of expertise and equipment you have in-house, and the quality of production you want.Costs can go as low as a few hundred dollars to upwards of thousands of dollars.  For example, to create a live stream Facebook video or a personal message may cost you nothing. All you need is a decent smartphone or webcam to make one.If you are a business with a shoestring budget perhaps outsourcing some of the production work might be to your advantage. New high-end cameras, lighting equipment and other tools are often expensive to buy.You can opt to either rent or better yet hire a professional cameraperson to do the shooting and provide you with the raw footage. You can then edit your video using freeware found online or use the services of a friend or family that has editing skills.However, you will first need to be prudent and set a budget before jumping into production. Doing so forces you to be realistic with your production and stick to your storyboard.By doing this, you also save an enormous amount of time because you don’t have to continue to grapple with second thoughts and expand the production into a huge production that is outside your budget range.Ask if you can afford a professional videographer or editor. Do you have the money set aside for new equipment? Or are you planning to shoot the video with your smartphone? Is it the right time to do video production? Do I have to designate staff for the project?Why is Video so Important in Marketing?Video is a great medium for marketing because it has three great advantages. With videos, you can broadcast your message, boost your brand, increase sales, and have a larger impact on your audience as a medium.The secret to videos is that it is easy to get the attention of your audience. Online marketing videos are the new word of mouth as they amplify your reach and the ability to share, like and re-post them.Today businesses use viral marketing, marketing that is infectious to the extent that viewers will want to pass it along to their friends.Because customers pass the message or promotion along to others, viral marketing can be very inexpensive and highly impactful. The secret here is the endorsement power since the information comes from someone they know.ConversionsAccording to surveys 70% of marketers, video produces more conversions than any other type of content. This pays off nicely for e-commerce sellers who have found using product videos can increase sales on an online store by 144%.Even if you don’t have an online store, including a video on a landing page can increase conversion by 80%, and after watching a video, 64% of users are likely to buy an item online.In regards to your online presence, video content can help provide high rankings for your website by most search engines. By some estimates, videos are 53% times more likely to appear on the front page of a Google search than a text document.They also increase engagement as many viewers stay two more minutes longer on websites with video than those without videos.The appeal is clear, videos enable businesses to communicate their story in a way that is engaging and personal.Videos give companies a platform to talk about their business, product, or service in a way that makes the customer feel at ease.Application wise videos can help better promote the business; showcase testimonials, and add flair to your press releases and other messaging.Can I Still do Video Marketing if I am not a Good Photographer?Yes, one can do video marketing as a novice and get better at it through time. However, you must be willing to learn the craft.To start with lookup tutorials for f-stop (and depth of field), ISO, shutter speed, and white balance. You can start on a project that might not require perfect photography skills to create your video.With relative ease, you can start on your path to video marketing by trying out easier projects such as live-stream videos, webinars, or making videos from photographs.You will, however, need the bare minimum of a camera recorder, a video editor, and internet service to upload your videos.Image: Depositphotos.comMore in: Popular Articles, Video Marketing",

Understanding the video creation process is crucial for developing an effective video marketing strategy, as it involves defining goals and planning to ensure alignment with marketing objectives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eStep 1. Determine the Video Purpose\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe most important thing that goes into making a successful video first hinges on your passion and creativity to tell a story. Before starting to shoot, you should ask yourself what you want the audience to get out of your content.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn fact best practices advise us to answer three core questions: What problems does the video content will solve?; How will your video content support your wider company’s goals: and what will be the outcomes and results that measure success?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBest practices also advise us to think about your Unique Selling Proposition (USP), which helps identify how you as a business stand out from the competition.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSimply put, describe the distinct benefit your users gain only by buying from your company, which is essentially your video marketing strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is why your business is capable of drawing attention, distinguishing itself from the competition, winning prospects and garner customer loyalty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is the canvas on which you draw all your messages.
