  "text": "For most of the past decade, Starbucks has held the coveted spot as the most valuable restaurant brand in the U.S. A large part of that is because while Starbucks is best known for its coffee, the thing it was really selling was the idea of a “third place,” a space in addition to work and home where you go and spend time with your friends, or just hanging out. Sure, the coffee was a big part of it, but it was really about the experience.But now, Starbucks has lost its top spot for the first time in eight years. Taking its place is a competitor that you might not expect: McDonald’s.You probably don’t think of Starbucks and McDonald’s as competitors. One is the place you go to get coffee and hang out. The other is the place you go when you’re fine with having a cheeseburger and french fries and your kids want to play on a slide. The thing is, McDonald’s has been working for a long time to become both of those places, and it’s working.According to new rankings, McDonald’s brand value rose 7% this year to $40.5 billion. Starbucks, meanwhile, saw its brand value drop 36% to $38.8 billion. That’s not just a shift in the numbers. It’s a shift in how customers think about where they go—and why.The reality is that McDonald’s has quietly been playing the long game, investing heavily in its McCafé brand, improving the quality of its coffee, and adding free Wi-Fi. In doing so, McDonald’s made a bold move: it started positioning itself as a viable third place.Coffee is high-margin, habit-forming, and deeply tied to customer loyalty. People visit coffee shops more often than they go out for burgers. The idea is that if you can win breakfast, you become people’s first choice.Over the years, McDonald’s has improved its coffee offerings, invested in better beans, and rolled out consistent quality across thousands of locations. Not only that but McDonald’s charges less for a cup of brewed coffee. You can now get a cup of reasonably good coffee—maybe even better than what you get at Starbucks—for less money.At the same time, Starbucks has had a rough go of it the past few years. Customer complaints mounted about long wait times, confusing menus, and a store experience that didn’t always live up to the brand’s promise.In late 2024, Starbucks brought in Brian Niccol (formerly CEO of Chipotle) to steer turn things around and “get back to Starbucks.” In some ways, his changes have started to make a difference. The company brought back free refills for all customers in-store, and eliminated charges for milk alternatives. The reality, however, is that it’s going to take Starbucks time to get back to what it has always stood for.In the meantime, McDonald’s isn’t trying to be Starbucks. It’s trying to be something even more powerful: the go-to spot for everyone. It offers what people want—good coffee and fast service—without the overhead of trying to create a “vibe.”In other words, McDonald’s isn’t chasing cool. It’s just trying to be the place its customers go whenever they need fast food—whether that’s Chicken McNuggets, an Egg McMuffin, or a cup of coffee. Right now, that’s winning.The important lesson here is that brand value isn’t just about logos and slogans. It’s a reflection of how a company connects with customers and delivers on its promise. Starbucks still has a loyal following and will probably be just fine. But for now, McDonald’s is a reminder that even legacy brands can reinvent themselves—and even dominate—in categories they didn’t originally own.McDonald’s outmaneuvered Starbucks where it really counts: in the minds (and wallets) of their customers. In the process, it proved that sometimes, the best way to win the third place is to be customers’ first choice.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
