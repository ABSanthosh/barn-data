  "text": "Squanch Games revealed the first official trailer for High On Life 2 at the Xbox Games Showcase.  The first title was a first-person shooter High On Life, which debuted in 2022. The game has been played by 20 million peole to date. Now the indie studio is set to infiltrate consoles on a global scale with its latest hilarious action-packed adventure this winter. High On Life 2 puts its players on a cosmic quest against an intergalactic conspiracy that threatens the fate of humanity. Longtime followers will be enthused to recognize multiple characters from their arsenals making an epic return including Gus, Sweezy, Creature and Knifey, the latter of which was at the forefront of 2023’s High On Knife DLC.  The trailer further marks the first appearance of several additional alien weapons and traversal capabilities emboldening users to embrace next-level combat and visionary scenes. With a wider armory and an all-new skateboard to bat, fans can expect to shoot, stab, and skate their way through a variety of exotic locales during gameplay. Squanch Games promises a showstopping escapade that is available now for wishlisting on Xbox, PlayStation, Steam, and the Epic Games Store. High On Life 2 will also appear day one on Xbox Game Pass, a sure-fire success following the accolades collected by the original title on the service. During High On Life’s debut, it quickly became the biggest Xbox Game Pass release of 2022, the largest 3rd Party Launch in Game Pass history, and the biggest single-player launch ever on Game Pass for the era. With a resumé already packed with achievements, Squanch Games is prepped to once again redefine gaming with its vivid medley of artistic, high-impact, and comedic verve. High on Life 2 You’ve done it. You’ve taken down an intergalactic cartel, brought humanity back from the brink of extinction, and hunted dangerous bounties to the far corners of the galaxy. Bounty hunting has brought you fortune, fame and love! But when a mysterious figure from your past reappears and puts a price on your sister’s head, your cushy life gets thrown into chaos.  Do you have what it takes to risk it all and bring down an intergalactic conspiracy that once again threatens your favorite species (humans)? High On Life returns as you and your beloved rag-tag team of alien misfits shoot, stab, and skate your way through weird alien worlds all across the galaxy to blow up an evil pharmaceutical conglomerate hell-bent on putting a price tag on human life.",
