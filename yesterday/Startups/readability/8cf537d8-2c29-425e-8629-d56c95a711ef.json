  "text": "HTC recently revealed that it is launching its Viverse Creator Program worldwide. This program funds 3D content creators in a variety of different projects, including interactive narratives, ecommerse, education and game design. The program aims to solve problems commonly faced by 3D artists, and currently works with over 100 creators. Applications for the program are currently open, with HTC reviewing them on a rolling basis. According to HTC, the Creator Program offers discoverability, easy publishing opportunities and monetization in an environment that’s rife with fragmented publishing platforms and closed ecosystems. The company pays guaranteed installment funding throughout development and post-launch, and engagement bonuses after launch on a case-by-case basis. Michael Morran, Viverse’s developer community manager, told GamesBeat in an interview, “For the Viverse Creator program, we’re looking for developers with backgrounds in gaming, 3D storytelling, 3D modeling/art, immersive education, and branded marketing. Applicants are not required to have webXR or Viverse experience. We encourage anyone who wants to be in the 3D webXR or general 3D web gaming world to apply.” According to Morran, HTC is searching for a wide variety of content for Viverse Worlds, including single-player gaming experiences, multiplayer titles, XR festival experiences, asset development and educational experiences — for the latter, it’s commissioned multiple educators to build within Viverse. The company aims to bring creators’ experiences onto any platform with a web browser. Morran added, “We aim to make publishing to Viverse’s audience easy using any tools developers already use (i.e., Three.js, PlayCanvas, Unity, and more). This lowers the barrier for 3D creators of all sizes, from studios to indie devs, since they can work with the tools they want and are already familiar with. It’s important to note that we directly fund the work of all creators in the program. We do not require them to work exclusively with us and do not require a specific IP purchase. This allows creators of all kinds to use VIVERSE to monetize existing projects or projects in development.” GB Daily Stay in the know!
