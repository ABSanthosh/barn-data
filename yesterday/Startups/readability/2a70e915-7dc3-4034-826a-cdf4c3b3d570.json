  "text": "Chatbot fatigue is real. When website visitors see a floating icon inviting them to chat with AI—even on the website of a brand they really like—it may bring back flashes of bad experiences chatting with their bank or mobile provider. They may be hesitant to click on it.But in an industry like travel, where the stakes are lower and the focus is on fun and enjoyment, conversational AI really is the fastest, most expansive way for visitors to find the information they’re seeking. My team at GuideGeek has now launched custom AI tools for more than 30 travel brands, and we’ve learned a lot along the way about how to drive engagement.Suggested prompts and calls to actionGenerative AI is so open-ended that it can be overwhelming for visitors. We’re used to search bars and website menus. We’re used to pulling information from a website, not asking it to do things for us like build an itinerary or complete a specific research task like compiling sensory-friendly hours at museums in a specific destination.While some visitors will jump right in and start conversing with a chatbot, others need that first spark of the conversation to get them going. Including a few common calls to action or suggested prompts that visitors can simply click on to start the conversation provides a starting point that’s really different from the customer service chatbots we’ve all been annoyed by.One destination we worked with quadrupled engagement with the chatbot on their homepage by providing suggested prompts. But why stop at the homepage? They’ve since rolled out suggested prompts on many other pages of their site relating to content seen there. If the page is about food, for instance, visitors see common prompts for finding restaurants in the area.Ultimately, calls to action can be automated with AI generating suggestions for every page on the site. The key is to also implement a ranking system so that unpopular prompts are automatically swapped out and popular ones are shown more frequently.Integrations with key campaignsWhile a major chatbot benefit is that it’s interacting with website visitors 24/7, that doesn’t mean it’s simply a “set it and forget it” solution. Brands that integrate their AI tool into their major marketing campaigns see better results from both AI and the campaign.For example, earlier this year, Tourism New Zealand launched a highly sophisticated campaign with Minecraft to coincide with the release of A Minecraft Movie, which was filmed in New Zealand. They were able to increase engagement with their AI tool while also rapidly engaging visitors in a high-priority campaign.With an influx of interest in the destination from Minecraft fans, we configured Tourism New Zealand’s chatbot with suggested prompts relating to the movie. The responses ranged from highlighting Minecraft-inspired itineraries, to showcasing bookable tourism product from across the country. Supporting content in the AI responses showed pages with Minecraft characters from a fully playable game, made as part of the campaign.With a large section of the homepage dedicated to Minecraft-themed calls to action, Tourism New Zealand was able to help visitors quickly get a foothold in a complex campaign with a lot of moving parts. The AI helped direct traffic and engage visitors from the angle most likely to resonate with them.Website placement and promotionA floating icon in the bottom-right corner is the typical placement for a website chatbot, but it doesn’t have to be the full extent of how visitors can discover and begin to engage with the AI. Even after the Minecraft campaign, Tourism New Zealand continued to make AI a centerpiece of their homepage with calls to action and suggested prompts front and center.Another tactic that works well is a prompt or link at the end of pages of content suggesting that visitors can ask the AI for more information about the topic covered on the page. This helps visitors see the breadth of how they can engage with the AI.We’ve even seen some destinations use QR codes at the bottom of content pages to direct visitors to engage with their AI on WhatsApp. This is a great way to help visitors make the jump from their computer screen to having a brand in their contact list on a messaging app.The results of launching a well-designed AI chatbot on a website can be powerful immediately. But by continuing to innovate, optimize, and integrate key initiatives, brands can access a great deal more of the marketing potential of conversational AI.The final deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, July 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
