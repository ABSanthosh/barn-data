  "text": "Courteney Cox didn’t mince words when she offered fellow founders advice at the 2024 Inc. 5000 conference in Palm Desert, California.Cox may be renowned for her work as an actress on hits like Friends, but she’s also the mind behind Homecourt, a Santa Monica, California-based homecare product and fragrance brand she started during the pandemic that sells everything from room deodorant ($45 a tube) to dish soap ($28 a bottle).During a wide-ranging interview on Thursday with Inc. executive editor Diana Ransom, Cox offered business owners advice on navigating the ups and downs of entrepreneurship. Here are her top pieces of advice.1. No Assholes The company you keep can have a big impact, as Cox knows full well. “The no asshole policy is the most important thing to me,” she told a room packed with entrepreneurs.Over the course of her career, Cox says, she’s worked with people who were disinterested in their work and more fixated on counting down the hours left in the day until they could leave.If someone isn’t passionate about their work, it’s better to find someone whose interests are more aligned with your ambitions, Cox advises: “Enjoy what you’re doing.”2. Forget perfectionAccording to Cox, the biggest challenge she’s faced while running her business has been balancing deadlines as a self-identified perfectionist. In other words, accepting when to move on, even if the minutia of a product isn’t exactly as expected (read: the font is placed a little lower than preferred.)Despite these challenges, Homecourt has experienced impressive growth since its inception: The brand has doubled in size each year, according to Cox. Its latest milestone? Breaking onto the shelves of Nordstrom and the luxury beauty store, Bluemercury.3. Take chancesCox isn’t averse to taking risks–rather the opposite. “I would say the most important thing is take chances,” she said.Right now, that means an international expansion for Homecourt–a challenging move, considering that some markets have tighter regulations than the U.S. Various countries in the European Union, for example, have stricter guidelines on what ingredients can make the final cut within a given product.And if one ingredient has to be removed from a fragrance product, that can throw off the whole formulation–leading Cox and her team back to the drawing board to make sure the product still meets their expectations.For now, she’s not letting that stop her.“I want [the company] to be a household name, but I think it’s limitless what we could do,” Cox said.",
