  "text": "Whether your business is taking outsize losses or in the midst of a winning season, two things are true. Entrepreneurs are always looking for ways to improve, and hiring is one of the most important decisions you’ll make. An excellent model for this cycle of strategic assessment and action is the NFL Draft.Each spring, owners, general managers, coaches, and scouts spend weeks in their war rooms poring over film, analyzing data, and tapping into their collective experience. They’re looking for the right fit. One player, picked with care, can change the trajectory of a team for years to come.The same is true in business. Whether you are hiring for your first operator role, adding a high-leverage executive, or filling a tactical need, the difference between a wasted hire and a transformational one lies in clarity, systems, and empathy. Here’s how empathy can help you bring NFL-level discipline to making your next critical personnel moves.1. Start with an honest and empathetic assessment.The best NFL teams build for the future and the present. They ask: What positions are underperforming? Where are we vulnerable? What could make our systems more efficient?These are hard questions that require emotional intelligence and flexible egos. Founders must ask: What’s keeping me up at night? What’s draining our team? Where do the outcomes seem underwhelming compared with an energy investment?Entering 2022, my firm, Curiosity Lab, had experienced consecutive years of 35 percent revenue growth. As we approached the end of the year, we noticed we weren’t creating the cash flow surplus we were used to. We were getting accolades and social media growth, but it wasn’t reflected in our bottom line, because our costs rose without notice. I had to slow down and look into details I had been ignoring. That emotional check-in led me to realize I was overdue for operational support. Hiring a fractional COO became my top priority.Empathy tip: Be brutally honest—but with yourself first. Model brave leadership when highlighting what’s not working. Then invite feedback from the team. The most urgent needs aren’t always loud. They’re often hiding in burnout, miscommunication, and missed opportunities.2. Ground into your purpose and identity.Before you start layering in people, you need to be clear about what you’re building and why. Every great NFL team shows up to the draft with a gameplan that matches their culture and vision for success. Look at the Kansas City Chiefs. They’ve been to four Super Bowls in five seasons, not just because of Patrick Mahomes but because of clarity. Their identity comes from collaboration. Ownership, Coach Reid, and coordinators come together to build systems that maximize their people.As a founder, you’re the GM and head coach. You set the tone. If you’re building a team, you need to implement the values and systems that produce the outcomes you’re aiming for.Empathy tip: Don’t let purpose sit in a deck. Say it out loud. Bake it into hiring questions, product decisions, and team rituals. The people you attract and train will grow in confidence, accuracy, and resilience because they are empowered and clear about their shared values.3. Don’t fixate on stars without a winning system.The draft is one place to fill talent gaps. Some teams need a breakout offensive weapon. Others are looking for foundational pieces in the trenches. The same goes for business. Just because a candidate has an impressive resume doesn’t mean they’re right for your system. Also, just because you need help fast doesn’t mean a shiny hire will fix the root issue.In the early days of Curiosity Lab, I hired a senior sales leader with a great track record who exhibited excitement for what we were building. In my haste to take advantage of momentum and interest in our business, I failed to lay out clear targets, marketing alignment, and deal flow systems. I hadn’t built the infrastructure to support them, and that hire ultimately underperformed and burned out. That was on me.Empathy tip: Don’t drop someone into a broken system. Know your playbook. Clarify decision-making. Identify your cultural green flags and red flags. Then, hire accordingly.4. Get your war room together.At the NFL Draft, the GM makes the final call. However, they rely on a diverse team of coordinators, scouts, and analysts to challenge blind spots and surface insights. Too many founders hire in isolation. That’s how you end up with mismatched values, unclear expectations, and avoidable turnover.Start by building your internal scouting team. That might include your leadership team, key collaborators, or even trusted outside advisers. With AI on the rise, I keep regular check-ins with consultants like Will Hatcher and Daniel Zaltzman, who specialize in this space, to ensure I’m scouting tech solutions adjacent to my talent needs.Empathy tip: People resist change and take hiring personally. The more you include your team in exploration and activation, the more likely they are to champion what you build.5. Draft for a dynasty, not for the next quarter.The best NFL teams have dynasty-level ambitions. They invest in culture and positional depth so they don’t crumble if one star gets hurt. They’re not just chasing wins. They’re building something that lasts. Visionary leaders are using tools like AI not just for automation, but to help simulate strategic scenarios, assess risk, and model future team needs. The extra effort of visualizing the future and charting your own specific strategic roadmap pays off in periods of uncertainty. While many companies focus on changing conditions, you can look for leveraged opportunities.This layoff cycle has released incredible talent into the job market, where a little empathy might go a long way. Challenger brands should move now to bring in all-star players, people with deep networks, hard-earned skills, and something to prove. Someone to help supercharge your company culture and help build the next great innovation.Empathy tip: Every founder hits turbulence. The resilient ones? They have a vision. They stick to their identity. And they build cultures that scale alongside the growth of their people.I remember watching the NFL Draft in the 2000s and barely noticing the New England Patriots. Year after year, they found diamonds in the rough, starting with Tom Brady, whom they drafted in the sixth round. Any founder would kill for that kind of ROI.Yes, this moment is uncertain, but that’s also when the best teams are built. Your dynasty awaits. Draft accordingly.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
