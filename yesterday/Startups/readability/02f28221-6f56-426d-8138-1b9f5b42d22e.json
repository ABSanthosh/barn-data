  "text": "February 18, 2025 3:30 PM Nintendo announced today that it is ending its popular My Nintendo Gold Points rewards program, which offered users virtual currency for the purchase of items on its eShop. Starting on March 24, no purchases made via the eShop will earn Gold Points, whether they be digital, physical or via eShop cards. Remaining Gold Points will still be valid for twelve months after they’ve been earned, meaning potentially well into next year. According to Nintendo’s news announcement on the subject, users will be able to receive Gold Points right up through March 24 based on the existing rules in place for the program. They also added that physical games released before March 24 will still be eligible for points even if they’re registered after that date. Regarding eShop cards that still carry the promise of Gold Points, Nintendo says, “You may still purchase and redeem these cards for their full value, but you will not earn Gold Points when using the cards for purchases.” The company hasn’t given a reason for discontinuing the program, instead thanking users for participating in it. It’s possible the decision could be due to the upcoming launch of the company’s new console, the Switch 2, which is due out sometime later this year. The company has also announced that its Switch Game Vouchers won’t be valid for Switch 2 titles. Whether Gold Points are going to be replaced by a new rewards program unique to the Switch 2 remains to be seen. GB Daily Stay in the know!
