  "text": "From a friend I’ve known and worked with for 35 years.Brad – like you, in the 7th decade of our lives, there seems to be three truths:1. Every generation has thought the end is near (ice age, nuclear threat, etc.) – always in the next 8 – 10 years, blah, blah, blah – has never happened2. Every generation thinks the younger generation is being ruined by the latest technology – radio, television, internet, blah, blah, blah – has never happened3. Every technology has been predicted to end employment for masses of people – electricity, machinery, computers, blah, blah, blah – has never happenedI responded with the following…I hope you aren’t wrong either. But, consider that you are also looking at it from a humanist, contemporary perspective. “Every generation” seems to be linked to the last 150 years (if you start with electricity). And, I know you are a traveler of the world, but this feels like a very Western perspective.Go back 1,500 years.Go back 3,000 years.Go back 65 million years.Go forward 5 billion years.We (humans) don’t understand “time” very well. One’s view of time (generations) is generally +/- a few generations from their existence. For us, that’s probably the 1800s to the 2200s. However, if you ask me to predict what will happen in 2201, I’m clueless, especially since I don’t think I can predict what will happen next week.When someone says, “This is the worst it has ever been” or “This conflict is the …” or “This \u003cleader\u003e is the most \u003cadjective\u003e” this is never a true statement, as there is always something +/- epsilon from this…",
