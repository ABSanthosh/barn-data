  "text": "Welcome to a very special, limited-time only episode of Off Script. Two of the world’s most compelling cultural voices – musical pioneer, visual artist, and activist Brian Eno and award-winning actor, author, and comedian Stephen Fry – come together to unpack the profound transformation AI is bringing to our world. Fry and Eno joined us at Pioneer, Intercom’s first-ever AI customer service summit, where they explored AI’s vast potential while interrogating its implications. These two legends have seen multiple technological upheavals up close, as participants and first-hand observers, and they share a unique perspective on how this latest wave of tech disruption might reshape our creative and social landscapes. “They remind us of important lessons learned from the era of the internet, smartphones, and social media” What emerges is a nuanced examination of AI that’s both optimistic and cautiously critical. While celebrating AI’s ability to transform everything from customer service to creative expression, they remind us of important lessons learned from the era of the internet, smartphones, and social media. Through a blend of hilarious anecdotes and profound insights, Fry and Eno suggest how this latest technological wave might reshape our creative and social landscapes. This unmissable episode of Off Script is only available to watch for 30 days, so be sure to watch it (and share it) while you can. You can find the entire Off Script series right here or on YouTube.  What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the episode. Off Script: Brian Eno and Stephen Fry on the rise of AI The dawn of an era we can’t yet imagine Stephen Fry: There’s a place in Gloucestershire called Kemble. There’s a field there, where when you go into it, you get a slight squish in your feet. There’s a little dribble of water coming out and there’s a plaque that says “This is the source of the River Thames.” Well, the AI you’re using now, Fin 1 and Fin 2, and all the chatbots you know, they are that dribble. They’re not even beginning to be what AI will be. And we have to remember that because technology is not a noun, it’s a verb. Everything we say about AI, technically, at any moment here or at a similar time now, will be laughable in a year’s time because things move so fast. Brian Eno: I went to a very radical art school, and then – like so many people who went to art school – I joined a band. I knew that I could use the new technologies that were around to make music in ways that really hadn’t been done before. The commercial synthesizers that people like me could play were really brand new instruments. For me – somebody who wanted to make music but had no skills – that was ideal. And suddenly this new art form took music out of the ephemeral – out of something that disappeared into space and time and turned it into a physical medium. So for me, music was always a way of painting with sound, really. I welcomed with very open arms all the new technology that was coming up. Not just what it can do in the abstract, but what it does for us, how it changes us. As fundamental as money Stephen: I was in a conversation with Daniel Dennett, the American philosopher. The question came up about AI: “Is it the biggest technology since the agricultural revolution? Is it the biggest technology since the industrial revolution? Since Gutenberg’s press? Is it that big, or is it bigger?” He said, “Yes, it’s much bigger. It’s as big as the most important and foundational technology that humans have ever had. Money.” Money. The whole world runs on money. Somehow there’s got to be a meeting of minds across countries and cultures to agree that generative AI – AI that creates anything, that makes anything – must declare itself. It must be declarative, transparent, and disclose where it comes from. The creative challenges Brian: Whenever I work with a new piece of AI, at first I think, “Bloody hell, this is amazing! It’s fantastic!” And in half an hour, I’m slightly fed up with it. I’ve sort of understood its style, if you like. And the most interesting thing becomes, how do you prepare your prompts for the system in such a way that they are forced to do something interesting. “Its nature is to suck up and take the most probable next word” You have to prepare the prompt so that you somehow close off all the avenues towards mediocrity that are gapingly wide open, sucking you towards them, you know. The thing becomes an exercise in trying to force this system to do something that is actually against its nature, because its nature is to suck up and take the most probable next word. That’s essentially what it’s doing. And you’re trying to say, “No, I don’t want the most probable next word. In fact, I want the least probable next word.” I remember I had a conversation with Jeff Bezos many, many years ago when Amazon had just started. They had just come up with the Amazon algorithm, which says, you know, when people who bought this book have… Stephen: Yes! Brian: I said, “Why don’t you offer the opposite?” Stephen: The opposite, exactly. Brian: Why don’t you have a thing – a box you can tick that says, “I want to know what people who’ve never bought this book, what they would read.” I kind of do that myself with my own book buying, and it’s very useful. I’ve found myself in completely new areas of knowledge. But anyway, Jeff didn’t take it up, which is probably why he’s the richest man in the world. Stephen: I was also very interested in AI. In the 70s and 80s, I read the work of Marvin Minsky, who was considered the father of AI, and he laid the foundations for much of what was to come. However clever AI is now, it’s meaningless. You could take machines and put them in the 1970s – in that time – and they wouldn’t work because they would have no fuel, because there was no data there. There was no digital data in the world. So, when Marvin Minsky wanted to teach a machine knowledge of something, they had to feed it into the machine, piece by piece. But now, data has filled our planet on servers – very greedy for power servers. Now we have this stuff for them to feed on. Examining attribution and authenticity Brian: The reuse of other people’s work is a completely natural phenomenon. Everybody does it without even thinking about it. So, it’s not in principle that one is worried about this. You know, the whole history of folk music and pop music and so on is the history of people hearing things from other people, nicking them, trying to imitate them and getting them wrong and making new things by accident, and so on. But that’s different from a system that indiscriminately sucks in everything and refashions it into something else without giving any sense of where it came from. One of the interesting questions is whether it is possible to devise a system that tracks the origin of the stuff that it’s using. Danny Hillis, who invented parallel computing, is now working on an idea that would embed in every piece of information its provenance. So, if you want to interrogate that information – say you read something that says people in Springfield, Illinois are eating other people’s cats – you can then look at that piece of information and say, “Okay, where did that come from? That came from that person. Where did that person get that from?” Sometimes, you find that person got it from nowhere except their own mind. Other times… Stephen: So, that would be a stop. Brian: That would be a stop. And other ones will follow it back. Clearly in an era saturated with fakery, we need that. But would anyone care? AI’s discretion in perspective Stephen: I remember giving a lecture at Hay-on-Wye on AI about eight or nine years ago. I said, “I don’t know what your children or grandchildren are studying at university. There are certain subjects I suggest they don’t study. Radiology, for example,” I said, “and a few others.” And this woman came up to me and said, “My daughter’s just in her first year doing radiology. What are you talking about?” Suppose a machine had every mammogram ever taken in its memory and the results of that mammogram. Just imagine how it would be able to examine each new one that came along – thousands every second without ever getting tired, without ever losing focus, without ever making a mistake. And what’s your daughter going to do to compete with that? “We all know how miserable it is engaging with call centers and trying to have problems escalated and dealt with properly” On a positive note, to prepare for this afternoon, I looked into Fin. There is no question that in the short term – and when I say short term, I mean five years maybe – we all know how miserable it is engaging with call centers and trying to have problems escalated and dealt with properly, and understood even. I can see that something like Fin and Fin 2 will make the experience better, and that actually sometimes you don’t want a human being. Sometimes, the human being is difficult because you can’t be rude to them. It’s unfair. It’s nasty to be rude. And they’ll say, “I don’t want to take abuse.” And they’ll go through what they’ve been taught to say when someone is rude to them. And you know that they’re going through something they’ve been taught to say. And it’s all just awful. And you hate yourself. And you hate the company. And sometimes you don’t want a human, when things are personal, when you’re feeling emotional. Imagine, for example, that you suddenly developed a genital wart. You wouldn’t sit with your best friend and say, “Hey, have a look at my cock. Look at this.” You would not do that. But you wouldn’t mind showing a machine or indeed a doctor who’s a stranger. And that’s a very important psychological fact that actually this idea that friendship is all about sharing everything is actually not true. It’s good to go into a cave and shout it to the cave, to a machine. You say to the machine, “I’m so mad! I’m really angry with this company because you don’t seem to understand that.” And they go, “All right. What is it? Is it this? Is it that you don’t like?” You won’t offend it. And it won’t get tired or bored. This is good, actually. I can see this working in the case of Fin very well. I can see it being a huge success. And if you sell it right and give the narrative correctly for customers, they won’t feel that they’re being sidelined with an automated system. It can actually be more humanized than the rigmarole of someone who’s been trained to say things. That’s my view. Brian: Speaking of genital warts… Stephen: Now that’s a good sentence! Brian: I remember going to the doctor once at St. Mary’s Hospital in Paddington to the STD department because I suspected I might have something. The lady was looking at it and she said, “Are you the Brian Eno from Roxy Music?” Which is exactly the question you don’t want. Stephen: Absolutely! The early promise of digital connection Stephen: My friend Douglas Adams and I bought the first two Macs ever sold in Europe and we became obsessed, absolutely obsessed. And at one point he said, “The future is networking.” You Telnet, you jump to a university computer and it can jump to another one and another one and they’re all connected up and it’s called an internet, and this is the future. And so we both bought modems. I was at home and he was at home. We wrote modem scripts and we eventually got it so that I could speak into my Mac to Douglas’ computer, and he could speak into his and I could hear him speaking. At one point it went down. So I called him up and said, “What happened there? Was it my script or your script, do you think?” He said, “You do realize we’re using a technology that we’ve grown up with that does what we’ve been trying to do as badly as that. It’s called the telephone.” But it enabled us to believe in the idea, this connection. Social media: A cautionary tale I used to come to events like this really and I would preach the gospel of Twitter and I would say this technology, this social media, is going to melt down boundaries. We will suddenly understand each other, the enmities will disappear, the old rivalries, and you know, it was borne out. There was the Arab Spring, you may remember in 2010, 2011, 2012. First Tunisia, then Libya, then Egypt, then Yemen, then Syria. Tyrannies fell. Dictatorships fell. People gathered in squares and demanded democracy. And it looked as if Twitter was behind this. There was a real belief that this was all going to work. And at some point, Pandora’s box opened and out flew the abusers, the trolls, the misinformation, the conspiracy theories, the hatred, the resentment. And so everything I say comes from someone who believed that social media was going to be a total good. I was completely wrong. So, knowledge of technology is not a guarantee of understanding how they affect human beings and what they do to our society. Brian: I joined the thing in, I think it was 1988, called The Well. Stephen: I remember The Well in San Francisco. Brian: Yes, so The Well was really the first public internet. When I joined, there were 4,000 people on it. I knew most of the other people, at least by name. And it wasn’t anonymous. There was a kind of ethical code of conduct, a sort of etiquette, which is that you weren’t rude to people. If somebody was rude to somebody, somebody else would take them down and say, “That was really rude. You should apologize for that.” And that person would normally apologize. Within a small group of people like that, you don’t want to be the bastard. And you don’t want other people to think badly of you. “For me, the turning point was around about that time, 2004, 2005, when suddenly it became an advertising medium” I remember at that time, I was interested in the history of money. I just put a message out one day that said, “Does anyone know anything about the history of money?” And I got so many replies with people writing very serious things about “You must read this book and you must see this.” I thought this was incredible. Suddenly, all of these brainy people are willing to help me for nothing at all. They didn’t demand a response. They certainly didn’t want to be paid. For me, the turning point was around about that time, 2004, 2005, when suddenly it became an advertising medium. Stephen: When Facebook gathered more and more people from one million, two million, 10 million, 100 million, a billion – and this was a lot of servers, so they needed to make money and we can’t necessarily blame them – they decided to advertise. And so they built an algorithm. And the algorithm said two words. The two words were: “maximize engagement”. Nobody predicted, nobody said – no psychologist or philosopher or computational linguist or any specialist ever said – maximizing engagement means maximizing hatred, resentment, fury, outrage. The more outrageous, the more appalling, the more dreadful it was that they dragged people to, the more they would be engaged. Brian: Of course, the intention, the aim changed from being something that would help people to something that made a profit. Making the profit always trumps every other intention. In the end, it becomes the main thing that companies are driving towards. Stephen: The fact is, technology is one thing, but we are another. If AI technology is to be of any use to us at all, it is to be in part for its uses purifying and helping and solving these problems that we’ve created. The importance of friction Brian: I make a strong argument – an increasingly strong argument – for friction. If you’re making analogue things because you’re constrained by materials and their availability and the speed with which things can be made, those things take much longer to come into existence and you can start to see how they work and how we accommodate them, how they disturb us, you start to understand the impact of them while they’re still being made. That’s an important period, I think – the development of something. A time when you can still change things. You can still say, that looks like it might be a bit of a problem. Let’s redesign it in this way or that way. The problem with digital systems is that there’s no friction in them. They’re almost instant. And so suddenly, all over the world, everybody has the same thing with all the same problems. You know that famous quote, I think it was Zuckerberg who said… Stephen: Ahh, “Move fast and break things.” Brian: Yeah, so I have a new one now, which is: “Move a bit less fast and make things.” Stephen: Yes, absolutely. And mend things as well. Mend them. “Move slowly and mend things.” Brian: For me the problem is not AI, the problem is who owns it and what do they own it for. And that’s what we should be looking at. So, there are two sets of questions with AI. How it works and all the wonderful magic of the internal system. But then there’s what it does to the rest of the world. And currently it’s a kind of massive Ponzi scheme, I think, sucking in money, sucking in people, and throwing out a lot of other people. So, we have to be a little bit Luddite. We have to think about this as a whole system. We have to think what does it leave us with? Stephen: As AI takes over various clerical and bureaucratic jobs, logistical jobs, and so on, the more your work every day will be about people. It’ll be about imagination, it’ll be about creativity, it’ll be about fresh thinking, it will be about taking time to reimagine everything that is around you. And it will be a huge advantage for us given everything that needs to be done, as you say, protecting ourselves from countries, corporations of the wrong kind, and criminals. But there are positive sides to it, and humanity can start to look at itself in new ways. Anyway, thank you all very much indeed. Thank you.",

Danny Hillis, who invented parallel computing, is now working on an idea that would embed in every piece of information its provenance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, if you want to interrogate that information – say you read something that says people in Springfield, Illinois are eating other people’s cats – you can then look at that piece of information and say, “Okay, where did that come from? That came from that person. Where did that person get that from?” Sometimes, you find that person got it from nowhere except their own mind. Other times…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStephen:\u003c/strong\u003e So, that would be a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrian:\u003c/strong\u003e That would be a stop. And other ones will follow it back. Clearly in an era saturated with fakery, we need that. But would anyone care?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eAI’s discretion in perspective\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStephen:\u003c/strong\u003e I remember giving a lecture at Hay-on-Wye on AI about eight or nine years ago. I said, “I don’t know what your children or grandchildren are studying at university. There are certain subjects I suggest they don’t study. Radiology, for example,” I said, “and a few others.” And this woman came up to me and said, “My daughter’s just in her first year doing radiology. What are you talking about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuppose a machine had every mammogram ever taken in its memory and the results of that mammogram. Just imagine how it would be able to examine each new one that came along – thousands every second without ever getting tired, without ever losing focus, without ever making a mistake. And what’s your daughter going to do to compete with that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We all know how miserable it is engaging with call centers and trying to have problems escalated and dealt with properly”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a positive note, to prepare for this afternoon, I looked into Fin. There is no question that in the short term – and when I say short term, I mean five years maybe – we all know how miserable it is engaging with call centers and trying to have problems escalated and dealt with properly, and understood even. I can see that something like Fin and Fin 2 will make the experience better, and that actually sometimes you don’t want a human being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, the human being is difficult because you can’t be rude to them. It’s unfair. It’s nasty to be rude. And they’ll say, “I don’t want to take abuse.” And they’ll go through what they’ve been taught to say when someone is rude to them. And you know that they’re going through something they’ve been taught to say. And it’s all just awful. And you hate yourself. And you hate the company. And sometimes you don’t want a human, when things are personal, when you’re feeling emotional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://blog.intercomassets.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Off-Script-Ep7-Stephen-Fry-Brian-Eno-Inline2.jpg.optimal.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImagine, for example, that you suddenly developed a genital wart. You wouldn’t sit with your best friend and say, “Hey, have a look at my cock. Look at this.” You would not do that. But you wouldn’t mind showing a machine or indeed a doctor who’s a stranger. And that’s a very important psychological fact that actually this idea that friendship is all about sharing everything is actually not true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s good to go into a cave and shout it to the cave, to a machine. You say to the machine, “I’m so mad! I’m really angry with this company because you don’t seem to understand that.” And they go, “All right. What is it? Is it this? Is it that you don’t like?” You won’t offend it. And it won’t get tired or bored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is good, actually. I can see this working in the case of Fin very well. I can see it being a huge success. And if you sell it right and give the narrative correctly for customers, they won’t feel that they’re being sidelined with an automated system. It can actually be more humanized than the rigmarole of someone who’s been trained to say things. That’s my view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrian:\u003c/strong\u003e Speaking of genital warts…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStephen:\u003c/strong\u003e Now that’s a good sentence!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrian:\u003c/strong\u003e I remember going to the doctor once at St. Mary’s Hospital in Paddington to the STD department because I suspected I might have something. The lady was looking at it and she said, “Are you the Brian Eno from Roxy Music?” Which is exactly the question you don’t want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStephen:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe early promise of digital connection\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStephen:\u003c/strong\u003e My friend Douglas Adams and I bought the first two Macs ever sold in Europe and we became obsessed, absolutely obsessed. And at one point he said, “The future is networking.” You Telnet, you jump to a university computer and it can jump to another one and another one and they’re all connected up and it’s called an internet, and this is the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so we both bought modems. I was at home and he was at home. We wrote modem scripts and we eventually got it so that I could speak into my Mac to Douglas’ computer, and he could speak into his and I could hear him speaking. At one point it went down. So I called him up and said, “What happened there? Was it my script or your script, do you think?” He said, “You do realize we’re using a technology that we’ve grown up with that does what we’ve been trying to do as badly as that. It’s called the telephone.” But it enabled us to believe in the idea, this connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://blog.intercomassets.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Off-Script-Ep7-Stephen-Fry-Inline3.jpg.optimal.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSocial media: A cautionary tale\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to come to events like this really and I would preach the gospel of Twitter and I would say this technology, this social media, is going to melt down boundaries. We will suddenly understand each other, the enmities will disappear, the old rivalries, and you know, it was borne out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was the Arab Spring, you may remember in 2010, 2011, 2012. First Tunisia, then Libya, then Egypt, then Yemen, then Syria. Tyrannies fell. Dictatorships fell. People gathered in squares and demanded democracy. And it looked as if Twitter was behind this. There was a real belief that this was all going to work. And at some point, Pandora’s box opened and out flew the abusers, the trolls, the misinformation, the conspiracy theories, the hatred, the resentment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so everything I say comes from someone who believed that social media was going to be a total good. I was completely wrong. So, knowledge of technology is not a guarantee of understanding how they affect human beings and what they do to our society.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrian:\u003c/strong\u003e I joined the thing in, I think it was 1988, called \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WELL\"\u003eThe Well\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStephen:\u003c/strong\u003e I remember The Well in San Francisco.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrian:\u003c/strong\u003e Yes, so The Well was really the first public internet. When I joined, there were 4,000 people on it. I knew most of the other people, at least by name. And it wasn’t anonymous. There was a kind of ethical code of conduct, a sort of etiquette, which is that you weren’t rude to people. If somebody was rude to somebody, somebody else would take them down and say, “That was really rude. You should apologize for that.” And that person would normally apologize. Within a small group of people like that, you don’t want to be the bastard. And you don’t want other people to think badly of you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e“For me, the turning point was around about that time, 2004, 2005, when suddenly it became an advertising medium”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember at that time, I was interested in the history of money. I just put a message out one day that said, “Does anyone know anything about the history of money?” And I got so many replies with people writing very serious things about “You must read this book and you must see this.” I thought this was incredible. Suddenly, all of these brainy people are willing to help me for nothing at all. They didn’t demand a response. They certainly didn’t want to be paid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor me, the turning point was around about that time, 2004, 2005, when suddenly it became an advertising medium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStephen:\u003c/strong\u003e When Facebook gathered more and more people from one million, two million, 10 million, 100 million, a billion – and this was a lot of servers, so they needed to make money and we can’t necessarily blame them – they decided to advertise. And so they built an algorithm. And the algorithm said two words. The two words were: “maximize engagement”. Nobody predicted, nobody said – no psychologist or philosopher or computational linguist or any specialist ever said – maximizing engagement means maximizing hatred, resentment, fury, outrage. The more outrageous, the more appalling, the more dreadful it was that they dragged people to, the more they would be engaged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrian:\u003c/strong\u003e Of course, the intention, the aim changed from being something that would help people to something that made a profit. Making the profit always trumps every other intention. In the end, it becomes the main thing that companies are driving towards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStephen:\u003c/strong\u003e The fact is, technology is one thing, but we are another. If AI technology is to be of any use to us at all, it is to be in part for its uses purifying and helping and solving these problems that we’ve created.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe importance of friction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrian:\u003c/strong\u003e I make a strong argument – an increasingly strong argument – for friction. If you’re making analogue things because you’re constrained by materials and their availability and the speed with which things can be made, those things take much longer to come into existence and you can start to see how they work and how we accommodate them, how they disturb us, you start to understand the impact of them while they’re still being made. That’s an important period, I think – the development of something. A time when you can still change things. You can still say, that looks like it might be a bit of a problem. Let’s redesign it in this way or that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem with digital systems is that there’s no friction in them. They’re almost instant. And so suddenly, all over the world, everybody has the same thing with all the same problems.

And that’s what we should be looking at. So, there are two sets of questions with AI. How it works and all the wonderful magic of the internal system. But then there’s what it does to the rest of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd currently it’s a kind of massive Ponzi scheme, I think, sucking in money, sucking in people, and throwing out a lot of other people. So, we have to be a little bit Luddite. We have to think about this as a whole system. We have to think what does it leave us with?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStephen:\u003c/strong\u003e As AI takes over various clerical and bureaucratic jobs, logistical jobs, and so on, the more your work every day will be about people. It’ll be about imagination, it’ll be about creativity, it’ll be about fresh thinking, it will be about taking time to reimagine everything that is around you. And it will be a huge advantage for us given everything that needs to be done, as you say, protecting ourselves from countries, corporations of the wrong kind, and criminals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there are positive sides to it, and humanity can start to look at itself in new ways.
