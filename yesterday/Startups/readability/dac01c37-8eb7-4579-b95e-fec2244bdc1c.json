Photos: Getty ImagesListen to this ArticleMore info0:00 / 0:00In a world of credit cards, direct deposits and Venmo transactions, it can feel a bit antiquated to still do business using paper checks. Still, they’re sometimes a necessity—but, as a harrowing New York Times column recently revealed, one that can come with significant risks.A New Yorker named Dylan Handy wrote in to the Times claiming to have lost all $114,000 of his 401(k) savings after the payroll and benefits platform Paychex mailed him physical checks during a rollover process related to a job change. However, the checks were later “intercepted and fraudulently cashed,” he says, leading him to take Paychex to court.“For some reason,” Handy continues, “this outdated and insecure method remains standard practice in the retirement industry.”The saga may raise some 401(k)-specific concerns for employers, who should give thought to the third parties they partner with in offering employee retirement plans. Yet paper checks can also come up in other business contexts that might give entrepreneurs pause, such as with customers who want to pay with them or contractors who want to get paid in the same way.Bharathi Ramavarjula, senior vice president of payments and ecosystem at the accounting platform Xero, says that small businesses generally stand to benefit from diversifying the forms of payment they accept, including checks.Doing so “increases the opportunity for more sales (that are also more convenient for the customer), but you also have back-up,” Ramavarjula explains. “For instance, if a check bounces, you accept other kinds of payment that your business can pivot to.”Still, small business owners that accept checks might want to consider taking the following precautions, the Xero SVP continues: Be cautious about first-time customers who try to pay with a check, as they could pose a higher risk of fraud. Carefully verify the details of any checks you get, such as by making sure that the payer’s name and the check number, date and amount all seem correct. Similarly, keep an eye out for inconsistent details on the check such as faded ink, missing logos or weird formatting. Don’t accept post-dated or third-party checks, which can be higher risk. Photocopy or scan all checks before you deposit them, so that you have a record to turn to in the event that the check gets returned or disputed. Use remote deposit capture to immediately deposit any checks you receive. And as for Handy, the woebegone theft victim, and his confusion about why this old-school mode of deposit has stuck around despite the security risks? He’s not alone, at least: in his response, the Times columnist Ron Lieber pointed to recent survey data suggesting that 43 percent of people have had to use paper checks during a rollover process, which may be because IRS regulations require that certain information be attached to rolled-over savings which physical checks make easy to include.Paychex, a publicly-traded company with a nearly $57 billion market cap, did not speak to the Times and did not respond to a request for comment from Inc. In a move that appears to be unrelated to Handy’s criticisms, Paychex founder Tom Golisano just announced that he will be stepping down from the firm’s board of directors.The super early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
