  "text": "February 23, 2025 8:45 AM Hey shower singers, Realize Music has launched its singing-wellness app, Realize Music: Sing is now available exclusively on Meta Quest in North America. Realize Music is an odd thing to call a game, but then again it is coming from Mike Wilson, founder of Deepwell and Devolver, and Mark Roemer. Now you can belt out some of your favorite songs from Chappell Roan, Boyz II Men, Kendrick Lamar, Linkin Park and many more artists in this all-new, one of a kind, immersive experience. Realize Music: Sing serves as a therapeutic medium to disconnect from the stresses of life through singing. Users can immerse themselves in stunning visuals, jam out to tunes from their favorite artists and explore an ever-expanding catalog of songs spanning multiple genres. Reap the benefits of both health and good music in an app that guarantees a good time for the sake of having a good time. The song catalog will be updated weekly for users to try out different genres and discover new artists. It has immersive 360 stunning visuals that evolve and interact with users singing voices. It may remind some of the older folks among us of the old music visualizers in the early days of games. Wilson believes that there are wellness benefits stemming from singing where you can engage in the activity without needing to be productive. Wilson said in an earlier interview with GamesBeat that it took a while to negotiate a broad license with the music labels for the rights to use artists’ songs. With the experience, there are gorgeous immersive 360 environments that react to your voice and evolve as you sing, aiming to provide therapeutic benefits such as reducing stress, increasing lung capacity, promoting relaxation and releasing endorphins. Melissa Wilson and Mike Wilson. Realize Music: Sing launches first on the Meta Quest platform with a massive and ever-growing musical library that features songs stemming from licensing deals with Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group, with more major announcements to come. “Music, for so many, can be seen as a safe space, a space to disconnect from the outside world and reconnect with your inner-self, letting go of any tension and allowing the dopamine to flow,” said said Mark Roemer, Realize Music CEO, in a statement. “We wanted to create an app that perfectly blends music into a form of wellness and that’s what you get with Realize Music: Sing. Users can sing their hearts out along with their favorite tunes and instantly feel the benefits in their body and their emotional state of mind. You’re virtually transported into a world where you can be carefree, jamming out and actually learning the lyrics to your favorite songs as you go, and with an ever-expanding catalog of music, there will always be something new to explore.” Upon subscription, users will have access to all genres of music from your favorite artists. Realize Music: Sing’s library is continuously growing, with new music set to release weekly. The next several months will see weekly song and artist additions to the ever-growing library as well as new features added to the app, setting Realize Music: Sing apart from any other app in the market today. In December, Realize Music announced strategic partnerships with two of the world’s leading music companies, Warner Music Group and Universal Music Group. Link To Original announcement. For a limited time, users can subscribe to an introductory subscription price of $9.99 per month or $99.99 for an annual subscription. Realize Music: Sing has access to more than 1 million songs, updated weekly, ensuring a vast and ever-expanding selection to suit every musical taste and mood.
