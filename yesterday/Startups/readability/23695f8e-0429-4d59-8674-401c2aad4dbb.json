Market shifts, team transitions, technology disruptions, or unexpected global events can send even the most seasoned leaders into a tailspin. Yet, the ability to make strong, clear decisions in the face of the unknown is what separates stagnant organizations from thriving ones.I often say, “Indecision keeps you stuck. Being in decision keeps you moving.”As a Catalyst Integrator working with fast-growing entrepreneurial companies, I’ve seen it time and time again: waiting for the “perfect” information or exhausting yourself with too many options leads to lost momentum, stalled growth, and missed opportunities. On the other hand, confidently moving forward—while still acknowledging risks—builds trust, clarity, and traction.Here are eight ways to feel confidently certain in uncertain times, without resorting to hasty or reckless choices.1. Shift from “right” to “right for now” thinkingMany leaders freeze because they’re trying to make the right decision, when what’s really needed is a right-now decision. Uncertainty demands agility—not perfection. That shift in mindset can be liberating. Instead of asking, “What’s the right move?” try asking, “What’s the best move with what we currently know?” This opens the door to action based on the current reality, rather than paralysis in pursuit of an ideal future scenario. The reality is most decisions aren’t permanent. You can build in check points to assess and pivot if needed—but don’t wait until all the lights are green to hit the gas. Remember you have permission to change your mind.2. Anchor decisions in core values and visionWhen the external world is chaotic, your internal compass becomes more important than ever. In times of uncertainty, grounding your decision making in your company’s vision, mission, and values provides a strong foundation.Ask yourself: Does this move us closer to our ultimate destination? Is this aligned with who we are and how we want to show up? 3. Create decision filters in advanceSmart leaders create frameworks when times are calm so that when waters get rough, they have guideposts to follow.A simple but powerful decision filter might include: Will this decision support our quarterly or annual goals? Does it serve our team, clients, and bottom line? Can we afford the cost (time, money, reputation) if it doesn’t work out? These filters help cut through emotion and complexity. They also build confidence—you’re not deciding based on fear or impulse. Instead, you’re using a consistent logic system you’ve trusted before.4. Use the military’s 70 percent ruleLeaders often aim for 100 percent certainty before making a move, but seasoned decision makers know you rarely get that luxury. Colin Powell, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, popularized the idea of the 70 percent rule: Make the call when you have 70 percent of the information. Waiting for 100 percent usually means you’re too late. Moving forward with 70 percent and being prepared to iterate is often the fastest, most efficient path. Remember you’re not locking in one final answer—you’re gathering just enough information to make the best next step.5. Don’t isolate, involveOne of the biggest mistakes leaders make in uncertain times is trying to carry the decision burden alone. Smart leaders ask for input, not because they lack confidence, but because they understand the power of perspective. Your leadership team, advisors, or even frontline employees can provide insight that can shift your viewpoint or help you spot unseen risks and opportunities. Involving others creates buy-in, which makes execution smoother once the decision is made. This is where leaning on your Integrator or COO is crucial. It gives you time and space to process, unpack, and brainstorm together. Uncertainty feels heavier in isolation. It becomes lighter—and often clearer—when it’s shared.6. Decide how you’ll decideThe big question is how will you make the decision? Will you seek consensus? Defer to expertise? Set a deadline and decide solo?Define the process upfront. Communicate it clearly. Then commit. This removes ambiguity and builds confidence across your organization that progress is happening—even if the outcome is still developing. At Catalyst Integrators we have some great tools for decision making that we use from Strategic Coach by Dan Sullivan.7. Practice decision making like a skillThe best decision makers aren’t born—they’re developed. Practice builds confidence. Give yourself small decisions to make quickly and regularly. Document your rationale. Track outcomes. Learn from your wins and missteps. Over time, you’ll build your own internal library of experience and instinct. Think of decision making as training a muscle—the more you use it, the stronger and more intuitive it becomes. I personally trust my gut and intuition and lean in to understand the root of my feelings to help me get to the best decision.8. Stay calm. Stay curious. Stay in motion.Finally, remember this: Decision making in uncertainty isn’t about having all the answers—it’s about staying in motion. Stay calm enough to think clearly. Stay curious enough to consider new ideas. Stay in motion enough to avoid stagnation. In a world that won’t stop changing, your ability to move forward with confidence—even imperfectly—is one of the greatest competitive advantages you can cultivate.The bottom lineYou don’t need 100 options and the perfect timing to make powerful decisions. You need courage, alignment, and momentum. Leading through uncertainty isn’t about eliminating risk—it’s about learning to navigate it with conviction.Because the only thing more dangerous than a wrong decision is no decision.The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
