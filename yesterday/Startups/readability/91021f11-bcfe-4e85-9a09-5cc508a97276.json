  "text": "OpenAI, the firm largely seen as being at the front of the pack of AI companies, is gearing up for a new race. The company has announced that it will be the primary partner for Álex Palou’s car at the Honda Indy 200 race, which will be held on July 5 in Ohio. As the primary partner, OpenAI’s logo will be prominently displayed on the car. The announcement marks OpenAI’s first sports sponsorship, but its relationship with Chip Ganassi Racing (CGR), the championship-winning organization that Palou drives for, actually began late last year. (Palou won the Indianapolis 500 this year.) An OpenAI employee attended a tour of CGR’s Indianapolis shop and put John Olguin, CGR’s executive vice president of business operations, in touch with her boss, Sam Altman. To Olguin’s surprise, Altman, who according to Business Insider is a noted car collector and amateur racer, already knew about CGR. Quickly, the two began talking about how they could collaborate. “We’re a technology company that races on the weekends,” Olguin explains, “and this [relationship with OpenAI] is a way for us to enhance the technology behind our racing.” On February 28, CGR announced that it had entered into a “strategic research collaboration” with OpenAI to equip all of its teams with AI tech in order to “maximize performance both on the racetrack and in the front office,” by automating knowledge-based tasks. CGR also said that OpenAI would have a presence across the organization’s race cars for the upcoming season. Soon after, OpenAI professionals held an optional “ChatGPT 101” class for CGR’s employees. Around 60 people from CGR, including the company’s owner, Chip Ganassi, attended.Engineering the perfect race car requires a lot of data, much of which needs to be recorded and collected manually. When engineers make a change to a car, for example, they need to collect data regarding how the car’s performance changes, and how the driver reacts to the change. AI tools like ChatGPT Enterprise, which Olguin says everyone at CGR has access to, could streamline these time-consuming tasks. “It doesn’t make decisions for you,” says Olguin, “it just gives you information to make decisions quicker.” Professional racing has always been a sport that combines athleticism and technology, and AI is just the latest innovation that engineers are using to improve their chances of winning. In the Formula 1 league, teams are using AI to simulate how a car will perform in varying weather and road conditions. And in late May, AI search startup Perplexity announced a “global partnership” with F1 start Lewis Hamilton. As part of the partnership, Perplexity’s logo has been added to Hamilton’s helmet.Unlike Perplexity, which made a deal directly with Hamilton, OpenAI is partnered with CGR, and is now expanding that partnership. Why? In a statement, OpenAI head of integrated marketing Sarah Russell said that “at its core, this collaboration is about curiosity, and how human skill and AI can push each other further. We’re proud to be represented at Mid-Ohio with Chip Ganassi Racing as part of our ongoing effort to explore how AI can complement human expertise and help advance performance.”Olguin said that the companies share more than just a need for speed. “We’re a data driven company that relies on precision and performance, and that’s what they do, too. It’s just such a logical relationship.”The final deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, July 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
