  "text": "David Warren’s name may not be familiar, but his contribution to the world of aviation safety comes to mind after the tragedy of an airline crash. Warren invented the cockpit voice and flight data recorder—the black box—in the 1950s. It is the final witness. After the event, it reveals the hard, unvarnished truth: what was said, what was missed, and how decisions spiraled. It transformed air safety by turning fatal mistakes into opportunities for preventing the next one. Now, without much notice, every corporate meeting is quietly installing its own version of the black box: the AI notetaker.  Your everywhere companion  Otter. Fireflies. Fathom. Microsoft Copilot. The names that pop up unceremoniously at the start of our virtual meetings are known by all. In fact, Fireflies recently achieved unicorn status and is reportedly relied upon by 75 percent of the Fortune 500.  These admittedly Orwellian platforms capture every word, generating real-time summaries. Tagging action items. They can even determine who dominates the conversation, an unflattering metric if ever there ever was one.  The AI notetaker is being marketed and used as a productivity enhancer, and they are even going solo. The Washington Post recently published an article describing how companies are increasingly allowing AI bots to attend meetings as stand-ins for actual humans, generating summaries for busy execs who no longer need to show up.  I fully expect these tools to migrate from the virtual to the physical world as well, leaving no space without some measure of surveillance. Shosana Zuboff’s book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism was published in 2019, but it fully anticipated 2025.  The next step beyond data capture will be something far more consequential: the cockpit voice recorders of modern business will turn meetings into memory. There will be profound implications. Just as the aviation black box gave rise to crash investigation as a science—the AI notetaker capture will launch its corporate cousin: decision forensics. A new era of retroactive insights.  Imagine having complete records not from boardrooms—those are rarely, if ever, recorded for legal reasons—but from the spaces where dysfunction begins: go/no-go decision sessions; strategy huddles; OKR reviews; cross-functional Zooms.   These are the seemingly innocuous meetings where blind spots widen, group think tramples dissent, team members brutalize naysayers and ignore market realities and core competencies. They are living and breathing examples of the Dunning-Kruger effect in action, where someone with persuasive salesmanship but a dearth of business rationale can overwhelm the room.  Which is why the post-mortem potential of the corporate black box is enormous and essential. AI becomes the official documentarian, able to answer the simple but profound question: How did we get here?  Solving corporate amnesia  I’m continually gobsmacked by the gap between the amount of time that teams spend proudly arguing for why and how something is going to work—a new strategy, a new market, a new acquisition—and how, proportionately, almost no time is spent understanding why it blew up.  The reasons for this back-patting-to-agonizing-analysis chasm are understandable. No one likes to dwell on failures, especially when many of the dwellers are those who participated in the initial bad call. Far safer to let it lie unassessed. Institutional coverups stand to benefit from our short attention spans and the rapid churn of organizations.  The presence of the black box will make it easier and more intuitive, as well as more routine and expected, to unpack the reasons for failure. AI will be an enormous asset here. It can do more than look at truncated summaries—or even verbatim transcripts—in the search for accountability. AI is also capable of analyzing the meeting as a mini-play—a psychological drama—looking at the individual motivations of the protagonists.  Who is flattering whom to get ahead? Who seems to be putting their self-interest ahead of the company’s? When do hardwired processes like the confirmation bias and the recency effect lead the human brain astray? There has never been the ability to rewind the clock with this level of objective precision.  Analyze success, too  This new management era of decision forensics won’t be just about focusing on what went off the rails. Leaders and managers will also be able to use the outputs from an AI notetaker to deconstruct the inputs and characteristics of successful decisions.   This is deeply valuable and extendable learning. After all, to get to the right outcome is a process that involves looking at the rejection of bad ideas. It also means defending good ideas against the subtle toxicity of those who say, “Let me make one small change”—when that change turns bold into beige.  From black box to Pandora’s box  The future of the corporate cockpit recorder will not be without a slew of challenges. As I made clear, there are governance and future discoverability issues. Companies need transcript protocols: What gets saved? Who can access it? What’s off-limits? If humans are going to have a permanent memory, they’d better learn how to manage it.  There’s also the risk of using the data for non-constructive finger-pointing. This is a moment of reckoning—between memory and misrepresentation, transparency and paranoia. The black box can become the corporate world’s most powerful diagnostic tool. However, this will be the case only if the right systems are built around it. Otherwise, people are flying blind—recording everything and learning nothing. That’s not what David Warren would want us to do.  The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The final deadline for the 2025 Inc.
