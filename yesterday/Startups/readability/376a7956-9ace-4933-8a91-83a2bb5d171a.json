The study drew from U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy data for 2023 to find the number of business openings and closings in each state during the year, calculate the ratio between them, and rank each state in a list. It defined a small business as a company with less than 500 employees.Related: 1 in 5 Small and Medium-Sized Businesses Could Be Out of Cash By Christmas, According to a New Report Louisiana, meanwhile, was at the bottom of the list as the worst state to start a small business.
