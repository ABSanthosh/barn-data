  "text": "The reconciliation package that President Donald Trump dubbed the “big, beautiful bill” could penalize entrepreneurs holding out hope for unprocessed employee retention tax credit claims.The bill, which passed the House last week on a razor-thin 215-214 vote, proposes to axe the credit retroactively after January 31, 2024. The final deadline to file a claim for the employee retention tax credit–which compensates business owners for keeping workers on staff when unemployment spiked during the early days of the pandemic–was April 15, 2025. In other words, Congress is trying to walk back the deadline it originally set itself, albeit these are different Congresses.As structured, the program allowed employers to claim up to $5,000 for each worker they kept on staff during 2020, and up to $7,000 for employees per quarter they kept on during 2021, though the first three quarters. Businesses could receive up to $26,000 per worker if they applied for both the 2021 and 2021 credits. And many did. In October, the IRS said it was processing about $10 billion worth of valid claims. That means that thousands of small business claimants could see thousands of dollars–if not more–that they’re counting on fall to the wayside. Not exactly on message for the GOP brand. “This is an administration that is focused on–according to the administration itself–helping small businesses and helping better the economy,”  says Brian Bernhardt, a partner at Fox Rothschild who focuses on federal tax litigation. “But these ERC provisions in the reconciliation bill don’t tend to support those goals. They tend to do the exact opposite.”While the program was structured in good faith, it’s also been a magnet for fraud. The Internal Revenue Service has denied billions of dollars worth of improperly filed ERC claims and the Department of Justice has pursued fraud cases against some claimants. At one point, the IRS stopped processing claims to deal with the fraud issue. Because of the amount of fraud inundating the program, lawmakers want to extinguish the credit once and for all. Mind you, Trump’s choice to lead the IRS–former Congressman Billy Long--has peddled the credit in working with Lifetime Advisors, a company that helped businesses apply for the ERC credit and received a cut in return.Still, the IRS signaled at the start of this year that it plans to process at least some 500,000 valid claims. It’s unclear how many claims the agency has received through this year’s deadline. The IRS was unable to supply any updated data by deadline. Retroactively terminating the ERC could deal a blow to business owners who filed their claims closer to the April 15 deadline which, again, was still in compliance with the original deadline set by Congress under the 2020 Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.It becomes all the more thorny for those that hired third-party providers, like professional employer organizations (PEOs) who filed claims on employers’ behalf. “You can imagine a circumstance where somebody gave their PEO all the information on January 1, 2024 and the PEO didn’t file until September or October for whatever reason,” Bernhardt says, explaining that PEOs could have been tied up with other clients, contributing to a backlog.He adds: “I wouldn’t be surprised if there are lawsuits.” There is a chance that the ERC provision could get cut from the final package. The bill, which now heads to the Senate, faces an uphill battle, especially with deficit hawks. Projections from the Congressional Budget Office estimate that the measure itself could tack on $2.3 trillion to the deficit in the next decade. The super early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, May 30, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
