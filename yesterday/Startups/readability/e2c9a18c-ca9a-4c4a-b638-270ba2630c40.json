  "text": "In my early days as a startup founder, I received an eye-opening request from one of my employees. “I love working for our company, but I don’t enjoy working with Paul. It’s at a point where I feel I have to start looking at other opportunities. Before I do that, would it be possible to be moved to a different team?”   Her question floored me. It wasn’t that the request was unreasonable—quite the contrary—I was struck by how reasonable it was.  “Yes!” I told her. “Of course, you can move to a different team because you’re amazing and I don’t want to lose you.”  I found my employee’s request eye-opening because it was something I would never have thought to ask. I reflected on my own career: How many hundreds of hours had I spent suffering alongside a toxic colleague because I thought I didn’t have a choice? How much time had I wasted being unhappy in a role that wasn’t challenging or accepting an unsatisfactory salary?  As Americans, we spend around a third of our lives at our jobs. It makes sense that we’d want those hours to be as enjoyable as possible—yet so many of us are often unhappy at work.  An estimated 49 percent of U.S. employees feel stressed at their jobs on a daily basis, according to Gallup’s 2024 “State of the Global Workplace” report. In addition to feeling stressed, 22 percent of workers feel sad, 18 percent feel angry, and 18 percent are downright miserable, the survey finds.  Creating a happier workplace is possible. As demonstrated by my plucky employee, taking the steering wheel of your career happiness starts with self-reflection and advocacy.  Why self-advocacy is difficult  Self-advocacy—the ability to speak up for yourself—is an essential professional and life skill. It’s also really difficult.  As kids, we’re told “You get what you get and you don’t throw a fit” when we protest about the yogurt flavor or crayon color we receive. The mantra is handy for teaching youngsters about manners and gratitude but can backfire when carried into adulthood. As adults with a fully developed prefrontal cortex, we have the cognitive skills to make informed decisions about our lives. We know when we’d be happier with a different “crayon color”—or team or role or work schedule. However, internalized childhood programming to be polite, unselfish, and cooperative can make it challenging to express those needs.  But advocating for your needs is not unreasonable. On the contrary, it can be one of the more pragmatic moves you can make, drastically improving your work life by strengthening your relationships and creating the environment you need to perform your best.  How to start asking for what you need at work  The good news is that asking for what you want is a learned skill. Here are my five strategies for self-advocating for your happiness at work:   Figure out why you’re feeling unhappy, uneasy, or stressed   Looking back on my career, the times when I felt unhappy often served as a signal that something wasn’t right. A decision wasn’t aligned with my values, or a hire wasn’t quite right for the team.  Negative feelings—whether unhappiness, guilt, stress, distrust, anxiety, or unease—can be a signal it’s time to check in with yourself. Reflect on what aspects of your job make you unhappy. Is it the workload? Management? The company culture? A lack of recognition?  Once you’ve identified the root cause(s) of your unhappiness, you’ll be better positioned to make informed, actionable steps to change.   Determine what you can change   I get it: Self-advocacy is a privilege. Not all of us can quit our jobs or fire a difficult coworker. For women and people of color especially, systemic barriers to job advancement are real problems that need to be addressed at an organizational level.  But no matter who you are or where you are in your career, there are likely things within your power to change. Start by gaining clarity on what you need. Ask yourself: What am I trying to achieve by speaking up for myself? What are my priorities, what am I willing to do and where am I willing to compromise?   Prepare your case   Once you’ve decided on an objective, brainstorm what you’ll need to make your case.  Are you seeking a promotion? Be ready to explain why you’d be a good fit. A remote work arrangement? Prepare to show that you can manage your workload. A raise? Determine a figure and make sure you can explain your reasoning. In addition the rationale for your requests, be ready to explain the “why now.” Making a case for immediacy ensures it happens on your timeline rather than your company’s.  When self-advocating, don’t be shy about promoting yourself and your successes. The key is to be confident, fact-based, and prepared with specific examples and documentation. Consider using the “we” versus “I” approach, which emphasizes team contributions while highlighting your own achievements.   Propose several solutions    Instead of fixating on a single outcome, come up with multiple solutions you’ll be happy with. You encourage the other person to participate in the negotiation by presenting several possibilities.  When brainstorming options, it helps to think about the reasons the other party might hesitate or deny your request. Be prepared to acknowledge and address one or more of their concerns to demonstrate that you’ve thought about their side of things. Often their reply will be “Exactly, that’s what I’m concerned about,” which opens the door for further dialogue.   Communicate with gratitude and an open mind  When communicating your request, frame the conversation in a positive light. Instead of making demands or complaints, start by expressing gratitude for the person’s time and talking about what you love about your job.  Throughout the conversation, keep an open mind. Your suggested solutions are jumping-off points for the negotiation. Try asking “what if” questions—what if I moved to a different team? What if I worked from home one day a week—as well as “if-then” questions—if I was promoted to this role, what would you need from me?”  Stay patient  You might not get everything you need from the conversation right away, and that’s okay. Small edits and improvements can compound into larger ones that enable real change. Customizing your happiest workplace takes time and effort, but the eventual payoff is a sense of empowerment and a job you love.",
