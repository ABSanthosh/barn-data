  "text": "December 24, 2024 4:04 PM Spirit of the North is one of the titles to be divested by Maximum Entertainment.Image Credit: Merge Games Maximum Entertainment announced this week that it is divesting some of its assets from its subsidiary, Merge Games. Specifically, it would divest IP rights for certain games and stock of retail products to Silver Lining Interactive, a UK-based publisher owned by Merge’s founders. This divestment is set to happen as Merge Games is in the process of merging with Maximum. According to the terms of the deal as made public by Maximum, that company will retain all rights to Smalland: Survive the Wilds, Bramble: The Mountain King, Pixelshire, Morbid: The Lords of Ire and Sunnyside. The divested assets include 90 of Merge Games’ titles, including Spirit of the North (a sequel was reportedly in development at one point). Maximum receives a consideration of €1,000,000 payable at completion, which took place on Monday. Philippe Cohen, Maximum Entertainment CEO, said in a statement, “This agreement is a significant step in balancing Maximum Entertainment’s financial position and clearing our liabilities. Recently established by Merge’s founders, Silver Lining Interactive is the ideal partner for this sale. The deal puts these divested IPs into good hands and sets them up for success, while allowing Maximum Entertainment to focus resources on flagship titles that we are confident will drive value into 2025 and beyond.” Merge Games was one of the many, many studios that suffered layoffs in 2024 and announced it was integrated with Maximum following the closure of its Chelford office (a former community manager said that, during this process, Merge laid off all but two of its employees).
