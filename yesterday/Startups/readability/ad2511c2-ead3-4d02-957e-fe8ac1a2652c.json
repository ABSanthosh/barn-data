  "text": "Carlsbad, California-based Aptera builds aerodynamic three-wheeled, solar-powered vehicles that elicit quizzical looks and stares. Now well into its second act after shutting down in 2011 following a first attempt, Aptera—the company says its name comes from a Greek word for “wingless flight”—is seeing a new surge in interest and is accepting pre-orders. Eight hours up the coast in San Carlos, compact electric pickup manufacturer Telo has a reported 50,000 pre-orders on file. Together, these two startups are forging a new partnership based on their core competencies in a fast-moving market. Telo’s practical and small all-electric trucks fill a demand for city-focused utility vehicles, and Aptera’s solar technology appeals to those who are looking for an alternative to an underdeveloped charging infrastructure. Created as a mutually beneficial pairing, the partnership doesn’t require either company to come up with additional materials or capital. It’s as simple as Telo customers gaining the option to replace their roof glass with an Aptera solar panel. Telo’s trucks are already in the pre-order phase, and if a customer opts for the Aptera accessory, it will be installed at the Telo factory.“It felt like a very low-risk opportunity,” says Aptera co-founder Steve Fambro. “We started conversations with Telo and I thought, ‘That’s a cool-looking product. If we made a pickup truck, it might be something like that.’”How Telo and Aptera joined forces The two companies’ meet-cute story is a thoroughly modern one.“In 2023, we got a knock on the door in our garage office,” remembers Telo CEO and co-founder Jason Marks. The knock was from Andrew Erickson, who owns an EV enthusiast YouTube channel. Erickson asked the Telo team if he could interview them, and they agreed. That conversation led to more, and the content creator introduced Telo to Aptera, another company he had featured on his channel. Today, Erickson runs Telo’s social channels, too. Marks says Telo’s leadership team recognized the potential to enrich its product as they started reviewing the conversations about Telo’s upcoming product on its Discord channel. Enthusiasts were talking about how they’d like to take a Telo truck camping and run the vehicle’s heater overnight or charge their phone out on the trail. The idea that it can use a solar panel to power up the vehicle’s batteries made a lot of sense, as it adds a bit more range and convenience for customers. The two companies proceeded with a design study with an open-book approach, sharing data and CAD files. After just a few days, Aptera engineers offered Telo an analysis on the amount of energy the panel would create, the multiple orientations that could be offered on the truck, and what they’d recommend. Both Aptera and Telo see only collaboration, not competition, in each other. “It’s an interesting phenomenon in that we have three completely divergent groups that make up most of our buyers,” Fambro says. “About 50 percent are early adopters, and another 30 percent are true environmentalists that want to do what they think is their part. The remaining fans are those who find the technology and intentionality interesting.” The vehicles feature vastly different looks and target different markets. “We were very much going after different markets,” Marks says. “Our vehicle is the pickup truck for downtown cities. Their vehicle is for the people who never, ever want to plug in their vehicles. That’s a very different category of people, and we felt there was no real competition and overlap.”A Telo vehicle in downtown San Francisco. Photo: Courtesy companyJoining up to target the early adopter marketTelo co-founder Forrest North is a longtime EV proponent and still drives a 2011 Nissan Leaf. The bane of EVs, he says, is the 12-volt battery, which powers the vehicle’s electrical systems when the car is not in use. “You have this 100-kilowatt battery that can’t do anything unless the 12-volt battery works,” North explains.That’s where Aptera’s solar panel comes into play; all the vehicle needs to recharge is to sit out in the sun. Aptera’s photovoltaic technology is designed to directly charge the high-voltage pack of Telo trucks with its solar panel (and that high-voltage pack juices up the 12-volt battery), so it offsets parasitic electrical loss with solar power. One particular commercial customer of Telo, Marks says, has a fleet of 500-plus vehicles they park outside all the time and are driven about 10 miles per day, which makes it an interesting use case for this partnership. “On the commercial side, ports, military, and utility companies require employees to be in their trucks for extended times,” North says. “The vehicle doesn’t move that much but it sits a lot, and that’s a great application for turning that heat load into energy to keep the vehicle cool.” Fambro points to an airline customer doing a pilot project for an Aptera-powered tug vehicle (the kind that pushes a plane away from the gate) that was delivered last summer. The solar-powered tug is another use case for different types of vehicles in a fleet that can harness the sun’s rays with little fuss. “Our hope is that we can move forward with a greater plan to convert all of their electric fleet to solar, because the airport has a very specific use case where charging is problematic,” Fambro explains. “It requires staff to go out of their way to different areas of the airport to charge, and they don’t like that. So if we can charge them in place, that is a big help for them.” ‘It was so aerodynamic and it was so forward’North, Telo’s co-founder, remembers the first time he saw Aptera’s first EV prototype more than a decade ago.Aptera’s EV. Photo: Courtesy company “When I saw it, I said, ‘Wow, I love this but are there really that many solar car nerds that would be into it?’” he says. “It was so aerodynamic and it was so forward, and I think that the public zeitgeist around clean energy and efficiency wasn’t at the same level that it is now.”As the two startups move forward toward full production of their respective vehicles, they’re doing so with realistic expectations. “There can be challenges with two startups working together, and I have experienced that in the past,” North says. “[The Aptera panel] isn’t a mission-critical element of our vehicle, so it makes it a much easier prospect. If they weren’t able to deliver that accessory that would delay our release of the accessory, but it wouldn’t pause the production of our vehicle.” Ultimately, measuring success and determining if it works and merits expansion is somewhere on the road ahead. Right now, Fambro says he’s looking forward to catching one in action. “Seeing one of these in the wild is really the very visceral sense of understanding that it’s working,” he says. “It’s proof that the whole system is working as you intended.”",
