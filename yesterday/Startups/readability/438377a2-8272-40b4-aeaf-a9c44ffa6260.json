  "text": "Like many female founders, Babba Rivera founded her hair care brand in 2020. But she tells Inc.’s From The Ground Up podcast that Ceremonia’s roots go much deeper. “I grew up in the era of your hair needing to be super straight, ideally not black,” she says. “So I bleached my hair; I was straightening it on a daily basis, and putting all these really toxic products that were promising me to tame my hair and to make it shiny and smooth.”“These were all BandAid solutions,” she adds. “And over time, my hair just got so damaged—frizzier than ever—and I just started to hate it even more.”This vicious cycle eventually led Rivera to start waking up one hour earlier every morning just to style her hair. However, after embarking on a journey to replace her makeup with better-for-you clean skin care products a few years ago, she started to question this behavior. “I remember thinking to myself, ‘Imagine if I could do that same journey with my hair,’” she says. She wanted to do so using Latina-made products like those of skin care brand Tata Harper. But they didn’t exist. Though Hispanics make up more than 19 percent of the U.S. population according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Ceremonia became the first Latina-founded clean hair care brand to sell at Sephora in 2022.Another reason Rivera wanted to create her own brand? Hispanic representation, she says, is too often negative: “In Hollywood, it equals being a drug dealer or a maid.” With Ceremonia, she wants to both “put Latin culture on the world map,” and “load latinidad with positive attributes.”Her strategy is inspired by French beauty brands. “I’ve been buying French beauty my entire life, and I’m not French,” Rivera says. “And somehow that felt like a luxury thing. I want to create the same thing with Latin culture, where I want not only Latin people, but non-Latin people, to start aspiring to be part of this world.”So far, she says, Ceremonia is succeeding at this: “About half of our customer [demographic] identifies as Latinx, and the other half don’t.”To hear more, listen to From the Ground Up on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and all other audio platforms.The preferred-rate application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is this Friday, March 21, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
