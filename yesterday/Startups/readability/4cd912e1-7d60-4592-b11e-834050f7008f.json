  "text": "Before he was pressuring the federal government to slash its spending, Elon Musk was reportedly turning up the heat on companies to increase their outlays on X.A report in The Wall Street Journal tells of a series of legal threats Musk and X CEO Linda Yaccarino made to businesses that had stopped running ads on the social media site. And, in several cases, the threats appear to have worked.Verizon, which had avoided advertising on X for two years, committed to spend $10 million on the platform. Ralph Lauren and at least four other companies also arranged advertising deals after the threats. (Musk, via X, encouraged other companies who felt they had been the subject of boycotts to consider lawsuits as well, threatened “name and shame” campaigns against companies he felt had wronged the site and, in a talk with the New York Times’ Andrew Ross Sorkin, told advertisers who were trying to “blackmail” him to change his opinions “Go f**k yourself”.) In separate negotiations, an advertising conglomerate X was hoping to convince to sign a deal, reportedly asked the social media platform to promise not to sue its clients as part of the deal. X said no.X did not reply to Inc.’s request for comment about the report. The alleged pressure campaign came following accusations by X that the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA) has organized a large-scale boycott of the platform, amid fears it would stray from its brand safety initiative called the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM).X did file suit against some companies in August of 2024, including CVS, Orsted, Unilever and Mars. (Unilever was dropped from the suit in October after reaching an agreement to increase its ad spending.) In February, X amended the complaint to include Lego, Nestlé, Tyson Foods, Abbott Laboratories, Colgate-Palmolive, Pinterest, and Shell International. (Last month, the companies asked a U.S. judge to dismiss the suit. To date, there has been no ruling on that motion.)The WFA disbanded GARM soon after the suit was filed.The reported legal threats are concerning to businesses for a number of reasons. Musk, as the world’s richest man, can outspend most companies in a legal fight. He also has over 221 million people following him on the platform, which gives him an enormous bully pulpit. The media covers him relentlessly, which further amplifies his reach. And, until recently, he had Donald Trump’s ear, thanks to $288 million in campaign donations.  Musk also joined the administration in a powerful role at DOGE, which gave him additional access to members of Congress and the Federal Trade Commission. Earlier this month, the FTC launched an investigation into roughly a dozen advertising and advocacy groups, with the goal of determining if they coordinated boycotts, which it claims might have violated antitrust laws.X has reportedly improved its advertising tools, letting companies avoid displaying ads around content they find inappropriate for their brands. It has also added premium content from the NFL and NBA, which is more appealing to advertisers.While ad spending did show some positive momentum at the end of last year and is expected to show an overall increase in 2025 (the first time it would achieve that since Musk took over in 2022), ad revenues at the site are still far below where they were before the acquisition, according to Emarketer.While some advertisers have returned, whether through the threat of legal action or less hostile negotiations, few big companies are spending what they used to on the site. Verizon, the Journal reports, plans to spend a minimum of $10 million this year and could spend as much as $25 million. Before Musk’s acquisition of the platform, it spent roughly $80 million in 2020. Amazon, also, is spending less. The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, June 27, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
