    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/134116/Brilliant-Leaning-Wheelchair-Design-is-Easier-to-Steer-Takes-Less-Energy-to-Use",
    "description": "Research assistants at ETH Zurich's Laboratory for Movement Biomechanics have identified a problem common to users of manual wheelchairs. Reto Togni and Stefan Villiger learned that wheelchair users have to constantly correct course, putting undue strain on their shoulders and occasionally causing injury. When rolling across a surface that's tilted to one side—as sidewalks are, in order to shed rain—the user must push harder on the down side. Also, when turning, the user must essentially apply the brakes on one side while pushing with the other side, effectively working against themselves.Togni and Villiger came up with a clever solution. Their modified wheelchair design can be put in \"steering mode,\" whereby the front wheels are locked into a straight position. The backrest is connected to the rear wheels, and when the user leans, the wheelchair turns:To test their design out, the duo had 29 participants each navigate an obstacle course six times, using both a conventional wheelchair and the prototype. The comparison showed a clear difference:\"It was already clear in the first round that the test participants needed much less energy to steer with the backrest,\" says Togni. Co-developer Villiger took part himself and confirms: \"When travelling with the prototype along the straight incline, I didn't have to correct the steering with my hand once. And it was also much easier to move forward round the bend. With the conventional wheelchair I was constantly braking and propelling at the same time.\" This is also shown in the evaluations (see diagram).Although the test participants required less energy to move forward with backrest-steered wheelchairs, they travelled faster than when in conventional wheelchairs. This astonished even the researchers: \"You normally need more energy the faster you travel,\" says Togni.…there are also further health benefits: the gentle body movements needed for steering are also likely to stimulate the blood flow and can provide relief against backache and indigestion. Moreover, the weight shift relieves the bottom and could help to prevent pressure marks.Another advantage is that you can navigate with one hand and have the second hand free to transport things from one place to another – be it an umbrella, mobile phone or a coffee. The only downside to the design is, it makes it more difficult to do 180s in place and to navigate within tight environments. For that reason, Togni and Villiger have designed their prototype to be able to switch back to the normal steering configuration.Togni points out the importance of doing user research, which is what enabled he and Villiger to come up with the design improvement. \"The wheelchair has [been viewed as something for caregivers to use] as a device for transporting sick and disabled people and has until now been viewed too little from the user's perspective.\" The duo have secured a patent, but have run into an obstacle preventing them from going into mass production: The onerous rules of the Swiss healthcare system, which demands high adjustability for different body sizes. The duo are confronting the challenges and hope to have their design on the market by 2027.Here's Togni explaining and demonstrating the design:",

    "description": "In order to design a quieter fan blade, German auto supplier Mahle analyzed parts of the animal kingdom with AI. \"We learn from nature: It inspires us in many areas!\" says Dr. Uli Christian Blessing, Head of Development Thermal Management at MAHLE. \"With the help of AI, we analyzed the characteristic features of bats, swordfish, and many other inspirations from nature. We finally ended up with the owl, the silent hunter, as the main template for our new fan.\" \"The design of the fan blades was modeled on owl wings and feathers. This minimizes noise turbulence and makes the fan much more quiet and efficient. 'One can imagine the sound reduction power of our fan to be like that of turning off one of the speakers on a stereo system,' Blessing said.\"The fan has been designed specifically for \"particularly demanding\" EVs and fuel cell vehicles, and is said to have 10% better performance and a 10% lighter design, as evinced by the generatively-designed support structure. Interestingly, the design is scalable; Mahle will offer units as small as 300W, for use in small passenger cars, up to 35kW, for large trucks.",

    "description": "Tips for purging and storing photos, artwork and paper mementos. Purging family keepsakes, photos and children's artwork can be SO overwhelming. As with any major decluttering project I take on, the process of sorting through and organizing these mementos took a lot of time!From start to finish, it took me NINE months to complete the process of going through all of our most treasured photos and paper memorabilia. I learned a lot through the process and wanted to share some tips with you. :) I decided I wanted to store everything all together when I was done. The bookcases I built in our basement have provided a ton of storage for us. I knew this was the perfect spot!: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. I still had plenty of room, so one of those cabinets is now a storage spot all of our family photos and stuff from our kids' childhoods. I had five main \"paper\" items to sort through and store: Small photos -- we had eight photos boxes FULL. Medium to large photos -- things like school and family photos. Some of my old family photos (some nearly 100 years old!!) are HUGE, and I wanted to find a way to enjoy them but keep them protected. Kids' schoolwork -- PILES of school projects ranging from tiny to huge. Mementos from our childhoods, travel and school like report cards, music programs and ticket stubs.Greeting cards -- more on that in a minute! My first step was to go through everything to decide what to keep. The key word there is KEEP -- one of my favorite parts about the Konmari decluttering method I've used for years is that it teaches you to hold on to items you cherish, instead of trying to decide what you want to give up. There is a difference, and I find keeping items I LOVE so much easier than deciding what needs to go. If I don't love something, I no longer feel guilty donating it. And if I LOVE it, I no longer feel guilty for keeping it, no matter how silly it may seem. It really is freeing to purge the clutter this way!Step one: The photosMy first part of this project was sorting through thousands of photos. It took me a loooong time to do this.Family photos and a small box of items are the only things from my childhood that my Mom was able save from move to move...so I cherish those photographs.Because of that, a few years ago I would have felt bad about tossing ANY photos. I've learned if I don't know the person in a picture and the people in my life who do (say, my Dad), don't want the photos...I can toss them. I can toss blurry photos I took from the bus windows on Girl Scout and school field trips. :) I can also throw away doubles from all of the rolls of film I took in middle and high school. (I did text some to friends to see if they wanted them.) It was SUCH a great feeling to toss a ton of the photos that were cluttering up the ones I wanted to enjoy. I whittled the photos down from eight boxes to five. I use these simple cardboard photo boxes and my last set held up for ten years!: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
