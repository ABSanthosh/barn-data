    "description": "Twelve moody holiday art prints that make inexpensive holiday decor. One of my favorite inexpensive ways to add some festive holiday touches around the house is with printable art. I replace random framed art here and there with pretty Christmas prints.  It's SO easy to either print these at home, or send off to a quick printing service like CVS or Walgreens. I usually use smaller sizes like 8x10 and below, but you can have larger sized printed and shipped to you in a few days.  I've shared a ton of FREE Christmas printables that you can download and print at home for next to nothing.  Today I've rounded up twelve moodier prints for the season that give such a cozy vibe, I love them all! All of these are under $5 (at the time of this post).  If you saw my Santa-themed foyer last week, you saw the beautiful Santa art I used there:  src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqgR6aOhYkqJOPvCvmzcJR1MoK05_T76bTBz_MrYPxN0i9l8mgExy6igBDumcIANvr4w3fS4LhU0XXxeW1c_HipeWpWT7MPZmw6tSsv4JA9v8pXxt1Wcqmgze_xab3reXyNs33P-R6afoVr-xjOZvplkRH3BpW0WmDD5ygCmsp5HoS9pEnjV1c_4nAnZQ/s16000/Santa%20themed%20display.jpg\"\u003e This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

Cat scratches on wood or marks from dog claws on the floors will vanish with this trick. :) Sometimes I hesitate to share these more basic \"DIYs\" or fixes, but then I do them in our home and am reminded that they are super helpful. So I'm sharing! :) This is a quick repair for anything wood in your home that has minor damage -- anywhere where the top finish or stain has nicked off. I miss the gorgeous floors in our old house so much!: They are white oak, finished on site hardwoods and are gorgeous. (The stain color is Jacobean by Minwax.)And they have held up beautifully. You pay for that quality -- they are labor intensive to install, but so worth it! Compared to our current engineered flooring, those were pristine (and we lived with those for way longer).We find a new scratch or nick in our engineered hardwoods often. It's not too bad...usually we don't even notice them until we're cleaning. It's when I'm vacuuming and trying to pick up what I think is dirt that I see them: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it).

We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it. I won’t recap our entire decision to downsize (you can see the full explanation here) but the highlights are: We used to live in a 3,150 sq. ft. home in suburban Richmond, Virginia Now we live in a 1,400 sq.
