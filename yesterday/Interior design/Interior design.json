    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/135644/Announcing-the-2025-Autodesk-Fusion-Prize",
    "description": "The Autodesk Fusion team is excited to announce the second annual Autodesk Fusion Prize as part of the 2025 Core77 Design Awards. This award recognizes the most outstanding project that utilized Autodesk Fusion product development software from all entries in this year's awards program – student and professional, across all 20 categories. This recognition not only highlights the winner's exceptional work but also underscores their ability to leverage advanced, modern design tools to create impactful solutions.What is Autodesk Fusion? If you're not familiar with Autodesk Fusion, let's start there. Autodesk Fusion is a cloud-based 3D CAD, CAM, CAE and PCB design tool for product design and manufacturing. It combines industrial and mechanical design, simulation, collaboration/data management, and machining in a single product. Fusion is widely used by designers, engineers, and manufacturers to streamline their product development process from concept to production. The Vivid Nine lighting collection for R\u0026S Robertson.Industrial design firm Vivid Nine, for example, used Autodesk Fusion when designing a lighting collection for their client R\u0026S Robertson. Thanks to Fusion being a cloud-based tool, the Vivid Nine team could design from anywhere and easily collaborate with teammates. To support its strong commitment to sustainability, the Vivid Nine team also leveraged Fusion's Manufacturing Sustainability Insights (MSI) Add-on to calculate the carbon footprint of their designs, optimize products for reduced carbon emissions, and enhance sustainability reports that they generate for their clients.Leveraging the Fusion MSI Vivivd Nine calculated the carbon footprint of their design.What's in it for me?Alright, back to the prize. The winner of the Autodesk Fusion Prize will receive a special prize from Autodesk (including a feature on the Fusion Blog) and a coveted Core77 Design Award trophy (seriously, if you haven't seen how cool the infamous trophies are yet, go take a look then circle back).Zexi Ye won the Core77 Design Awards 2024 Fusion prize.Read all about Adæpt by Zexi Ye, the Core77 Design Awards 2024 Fusion winner here.Adæpt, designed by Zexi Ye, took home last year's Autodesk Fusion prize for its exceptional concept. The product is a computer-accessible tool that enables people with cerebral palsy to freely and independently access the digital world thanks to its easy-to-use touchpad, tactile navigation, remote assistance and more. We also enjoyed hearing how Fusion enabled Zexi to transition seamlessly from physical to digital prototyping and vice versa. This helped ensure that the final design met the ergonomic needs of users with cerebral palsy and could accommodate various hand postures and motor skill abilities.The Mesh environment in Fusion was particularly helpful for Zexi during the 3D modeling stage. \"The 'do not capture design history' and 'file history' features allow me to create without fear,\" he explains. \"When it's time for a quick visualization, I switch to the rendering panel to see what the product looks like with real materials.\" Learn more about Adæpt here.How to enter the Core77 Design Awards 2025The first step on the path to winning the Autodesk Fusion Prize is to enter the Core77 Design Awards. We encourage all designers and engineers who have utilized Fusion software in their submissions – both student and professional - to enter this year's awards.

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/135643/Why-Van-Racking-Company-Sortimo-Made-an-Automatic-Door",
    "description": "Here's an example of a company going above and beyond to solve their clients' problems. Sortimo is a German manufacturer of mobile tool storage solutions; van racks and corresponding carry cases are their stock-in-trade. Tradespeople in Europe fit their vans out with Sortimo kit for greater efficiency.So you might wonder why Sortimo's new product is…a door. Well, it isn't just any door; their ProPartition Automatic, which is designed to separate the van's cab and storage areas, automatically opens once the driver leaves their seat. It closes again when the driver sits.It might seem silly or frivolous, but the company points out a potentially massive time-savings. \"One thing is particularly important in the courier and parcel service industry: Saving time. Time is money and therefors a major competitive advantage.\"This automation will save around 10 seconds at each delivery stop, which will result in a daily volume of 200 stops. Gain 30 minutes of time.\"",

    "description": "How to fix furniture damage and painting mistakes.  Recently I painted our dining room buffet and had SO many issues during the process. I'm sharing how I fixed all of them along the way and ended up with a gorgeous result!  I know better by now...I've learned to never say to myself \"Wow! This project is going so well!\" -- because something inevitably happens right after I say it.  Definitely can't think it, and never say it out loud. 😂 I also know I should never, ever EVER tell myself that a DIY project won't take long. I've done it a million times...this will be so easy! This won't take long at all! I've done this 800 million times, what could go wrong?  I know these things, and yet this is what I did.  Here's the culprit...the wood sideboard I purchased for our dining room a few months after we moved in:  A friend of mine owned a beautiful home decor shop, and I found it there about seven years ago. I was SO in love with it, especially the cane doors.  It fit in beautifully with the \"nod\" to farmhouse style that I had going throughout our house. It's also just a really useful piece -- I store a ton of serving dishes inside.  Later I built a wall of bookcases and a window seat at the end of this room and painted the main wall a dark blue with pretty picture frame molding.  Last year I switched gears completely and painted the whole room in a warm and lovely color called Pachyderm:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

We can't live without this stuff now! This isn't a sponsored post, I just like to share things that work. If you have animals I think you'll find it worthwhile.Just a warning...these are the worst pictures you'll ever see on the blog. 😂 I can't get around not showing you so you can see how it works, so bear with me.   Our little chihuahua dog absolutely HATES going out when it's really cold out. He's fine most days, but when it's bone-chilling cold he will go in and out as fast as possible. I can't blame him!  This time of year we will occasionally find a little pee spot:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. About eight years ago I found a non-toxic pet stain spray called Furry Freshness on a Facebook ad of all places. I decided to try it out based on the raving reviews. It really is a miracle solution. I've never used anything like it! You just spray the spot enough so that it's saturated: And by the next day the stain will be gone (well, usually). Sometimes we have to spray again, but it's just the same process of saturating the stain. We've used this so many times in our house and I can't even find the spots where we sprayed.  Let it sit for the best results -- don't scrub it into the carpet, don't do anything! This was just a few hours later:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it).
