    "description": "There was a period in human history where we developed glass, but hadn't yet figured out glassblowing. In order to shape the glass into vessels, Mesopotamians got creative and developed a technique called slumping.They started with the glass ingots they were able to produce, and fused several of them together to create a larger mass. This was then placed over a form made of clay or stone, then placed into a kiln. Firing the kiln heated the glass, which then began to slump down over the form. In this manner, they were able to produce glass bowls and plates.Industrial designer and design researcher Marco Compardo demonstrates the technique here, which he worked on at the UK's Grymsdyke Farm, an experimental design lab.\"These are photos of the slumping process, showing how heat and gravity are used to shape glass (and ideas) over a mold. As the glass softens in the kiln, it gently conforms to the form beneath it—capturing smooth, organic curves without the need for cutting.\" \"'Unroll' is a butter tray conceived through digital calculations, designed to create a seamless, wrinkle-free dome using the slump glass technique. The outcome recalls the material handling found in ceramics.\" \"Although rooted in contemporary, digital methods, the design resonates with processes that are more closely associated with the tactile, hands-on approach of ceramics, where craftsmanship and material manipulation are key elements.\" You can see more of Campardo's work here.",

Aimed at those seeking aquatic recreation, the RunOff Waterproof Waist Pack is submersible and, in case you drop it in the drink, buoyant. The real draw for the forever-connected will be its clear window and smartphone pouch, which allows you to work the touchscreen while your phone's safely locked inside. The TPU bag features a toothless zipper that manufacturer Nite-Ize says is completely waterproof and dust-proof. It'll hold 3 liters' worth of stuff. The adjustable straps allow it to be worn like a cross-body sling, or like a fanny pack for those who don't give a damn.These run $80.",

We might worry too much about what other people will think (especially for those of us who post our homes on social media, since we have Instagram telling us what people like or don't like). We sometimes worry too much about the impact our changes will have on a future sale, even if we are making good decisions and have no plans to move any time soon.

You'll need a few tools in order to hang them so that they withstand the elements. You'll also need to consider where you are hanging them from to ensure they will be sturdy over time.

I felt like Goldilocks -- some were too wimpy and the bulbs broke easily. A lot of them weren't nearly long enough for what we needed. The lights we ended up using are still going strong ten years later! They are the industrial grade Feit incandescent string lights and when I found out they are what most businesses (restaurants especially) use, I was sold.Many of my readers suggested these way back then -- thank you! You can usually find these light strands at Costco too. We used them on our outdoor dining area under the wood pergola at that house:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
