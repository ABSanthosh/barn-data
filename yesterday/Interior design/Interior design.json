    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/135332/Specialty-Sinks-for-Washing-Your-Bicycle-or-Dog",
    "description": "Is this something you've seen in America? I've just learned it's a thing in Canadian apartment and condo buildings to feature a bike-washing station. The one you see here is made by Canadian manufacturer Ridalco. The stainless steel sinks are seven feet wide and a little over two feet deep. A pair of protruding bars on either side can be used to hold your bike's wheels in place. A similar product with a different application: Another Canadian company called Furever Clean offers these dog washing tubs. As with the bike washing stations, they're offered as an amenity in some Canadian apartment buildings. There's a bit more actual design in these as opposed to the bike sink. Sizes range from about 32\" wide to five feet. There's a lift-in option for small dogs, and two versions with doors for large dogs, one with a step and the other with a ramp. Typically when you wash a dog in a bathtub, they can't gain good traction on the slippery tub floor. This often adds stress to what is already, at least for the dogs I've owned, an undesirable activity. To compensate, the sinks feature these rubbery drainage mats that allows the dog's paws to gain purchase. After draining through the mats, the water passes through this removable mesh basket. This catches dog hair, preventing it from clogging the drain. Along the back of the sink, you can see a rail to attach a tether to. There are also hang-on shelves to hold product. In addition to apartment buildings, the company also sells branded versions of these to dogcare businesses. The two products are close in material and scale. So I was surprised to see that Ridalco makes bike sinks but not dog sinks, and vice versa for Furever Clean. Perhaps they'd benefit from a merger.",

    "description": "Step-by-step tutorial to recover a seat cushion with new fabric. You can give almost any upholstered dining or accent chair a brand-new look with minimal time and effort!  I've recovered quite a few chairs over the years, and some were easier than others. One of my most difficult DIY projects ever was recovering our upholstered dining room chairs years ago.  All six had fabric on the seat as well as the back, and removing all of it was one of the most tedious and annoying projects I've ever taken on. ;) I would rather not do that ever again.  But the process of cover the chairs with new fabric wasn't that bad at all! The easiest process when you have a chair with an upholstered seat cushion that is removable.  My latest project was in my office. I've had this more modern chair in there for years (this is the best pic of it with the new wallpaper and paint):  But the more I transformed this room, the more it felt of out of place. I wanted something a little cozier, a little warmer that fit in better.  I found the perfect chair on Facebook Marketplace. I loved the warm, dark wood tone and the caning on the back: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Tips to easily purge and declutter items from your home!Have you caught the decluttering bug yet this year? Is there anything better after the busyness and STUFF of the holiday season? The first few weeks of this year I was a decluttering FIEND. It's been a long time since I've focused so much on purging things from our house. It's been almost ten years since I went through our entire (old) house and decluttered EV.ER.Y.THING. Back then I wrote about how much I like the Konmari decluttering method and how I used it. The Konmari decluttering method.I think the part that can turn people off from this method is the main message -- asking yourself if the items in your home bring you joy. If not, let go of them. I mean, it's a little simplistic. I don't LOVE the whisk in our kitchen drawer, so why keep it? 😂 So when I use this process I focus on things that I truly enjoy and we use often. These two qualifiers make it much easier to figure out what to keep!Notice I said keep. This method makes me focus more on the things that I love, not things that don't serve us well. If I like and use it...it's easier to keep it in our home. If it doesn't fit, I don't like the color, isn't my style anymore AND I haven't used it in years...then I let it go without a second thought. For some reason, deciding what to keep is easier for me than determining what to give away. The Komari decluttering process worked so well for me, I've been really good at constantly asking myself those questions as I go about day to day life in our home. It's not unusual for me to donate a small bag of items every week. Home decor decluttering process.But after the holidays, I knew it was time to tackle a spot I never focus on. Our basement storage room is wonderful and has plenty of room to store items away, but it becomes a dumping ground (especially after Christmas).A few years ago I made an effort to organize the home decor items I was holding onto for future projects:This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.When I think back to how much STUFF we moved into this house almost eight years ago, I truly can't believe it. Even after doing the major purge before we moved, I did another HUGE home decor declutter about a year after we moved in. I still had a lot, knowing I would be building a few built ins around the house that would need decor. Now that the family room, office, dining and basement bookcases and builds are done, I can let go of a bunch. Right after Christmas, I stood in front of those plastic shelves and realized there was very little I had a desire to keep. When it hits, it hits. I wanted it GONE. Ha! I say this all the time, but the with each year of my life, I want less stuff in our house. At least stuff that isn't meaningful. In my 20's and 30's I often kept more than needed. I know that was a response to a difficult childhood -- it used to pain me to get rid of something I had spent money on. (Even if it was 20 years earlier.)So I gathered like items and placed them on a table so I could see what I was dealing with: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
