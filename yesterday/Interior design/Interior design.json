    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/137804/Industrial-Design-Case-Study-Customizable-3D-Printed-Lamps",
    "description": "The Dollight lamp is by San-Diego-based industrial design firm Official Use Only. Created under the motto \"When personal design meets custom manufacturing,\" the challenge was to reconcile mass production with individual customization. And the design work was only half of it: OUO founder Michael Kritzer formed Dolop, a separate company, to produce the lamps. The challenge every design brand faces: How do you create meaningful, customizable products without the compromises of mass production or the exclusivity of full custom work?Our solution for dolop: We developed a collection of sculptural table lamps inspired by Japanese Kokeshi dolls. Each Dollight is 3D-printed fresh when ordered, offering 100+ combinations through food-inspired colors and textures, while connecting every purchase to charitable causes through the Sweetest Slice Program. The result: A new model for artisan-scale manufacturing that's both accessible and personal—where technology enables designer oversight at every step, customers get truly custom pieces, and every purchase creates positive community impact.Made fresh when ordered. Designed to bring joy without demanding attention. The Full StoryThe Challenge That Sparked InnovationThe Problem: The lighting industry forces customers into an impossible choice: mass-produced products that lack personality, or custom work that's prohibitively expensive and exclusive. Meanwhile, design brands who want to create meaningful objects face the same dilemma—compromise vision for scale, or limit impact to the few who can afford bespoke work.The Brand Reality: dolop wanted to create something deeply personal—lighting inspired by family members while making family-inspired design accessible to others without losing the intimacy that makes it special. The Manufacturing Challenge: Traditional production requires massive upfront investment, minimum orders, and inventory risk. Custom work requires individual attention that makes pricing unrealistic for most customers.The Market Gap: No one had figured out how to make truly customizable, designer-quality lighting that was both personal and accessible, while maintaining direct designer involvement in every piece. The Strategic BreakthroughInstead of choosing between mass production and custom work, we found the sweet spot: on-demand 3D printing that enables artisan-scale manufacturing with designer oversight. Each Dollight is made fresh when ordered, allowing infinite customization without inventory risk.Why Japanese Kokeshi Dolls as Inspiration: These traditional wooden dolls represent the perfect balance of simplicity and personality—each one unique yet unmistakably part of a family. They became the perfect metaphor for lighting that brings character without overwhelming a space.The Food-Inspired Language Strategy: By naming colors after foods (Ananas, Tomato, Matcha, Cotton Candy), we made technical choices feel warm and accessible. Customers aren't choosing \"RAL 1028 Yellow\"—they're choosing \"Ananas\" because it makes them smile.The Charitable Connection Innovation: The Sweetest Slice Program connects each color family to local San Diego charities, so every purchase creates community impact. Your lighting choice becomes a values choice, adding meaning beyond the object itself. The Transformation ResultsManufacturing Revolution: No inventory, no waste, no compromise. Each Dollight is 3D-printed in dolop's San Diego workshop only after purchase, using premium bio-based materials from corn and sugarcane. The founder personally oversees every piece from digital file to finished lamp.Customization Without Complexity: Over 100 combinations through 16 food-inspired colors and multiple textures, but the selection process feels intuitive rather than overwhelming. Customers create something uniquely theirs without needing design expertise.Family Stories Made Universal: Each design (Sweet, Bright, Smooth, Rich, Savory) captures the personality of a family member, but translates into lighting that works in any home. Community Impact Integration: The Sweetest Slice Program means every color choice supports local causes—education, healthcare, conservation, food security. Beautiful lighting becomes beautiful impact.Personal Connection at Scale: Every customer receives a personal note, 30-day returns with no restocking fees, and ongoing support through the Diffuser Replacement Program. Technology enables personal attention, not elimination of it.New Manufacturing Model: dolop proves that design brands can stay personally involved while making their work accessible. The brand demonstrates the future of American manufacturing where creativity, technology, and community impact converge. You can see more of OUO's work here.",

    "description": "How to easily treat wood butcher block counters so they will resist moisture and last forever!Contrary to popular belief, wood countertops are not hard to take care of! If you treat them correctly up front, they will last for decades (even around a sink). One of the top five questions I get about our house (and our old one!) is about our butcher block countertops. We've had wood counters on our islands for around 15 years now. Thanks to my Dad I know the best way to treat them and keep them beautiful for years! I shared how to protect bare wood counters a few years ago, so check out that post to see more detail. I also share how I stained the butcher block in that post. This time I wanted to show you how well they have held up over the past eight years and share how I retreat them every year or so: It's really best to reapply this every six months or so...but as you'll see, it's not absolutely necessary. Ours have held up beautifully even after a year or more.  Overall, the whole island counter has lightened from use, and it was uniform. The only part that was slightly darker was under the tray that I use for hand and dish soap: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   Nearly EVERYTHING is easily cleaned off of the wood counters. We've had water condensation sit for hours, water spills, wine, cat vomit 😖 -- all of it. If you treat them well like I'll show you, you won't have any issues keeping them clean.  The only thing that I haven't been able to remove is permanent marker:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
