    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/135547/Architect-Industrial-Designer-and-Sculptor-Robert-Obiers-Creations",
    "description": "Robert Obier has taken an unusual vocational path: Architecture degree from LSU, followed by a Masters of Industrial Design from ArtCenter. After all that, he opted to become a fine artist. Hopefully that's more to do with Obier's passions than being a damning indictment of the two fields closest to us.The prolific Obier produces sculptural artworks that bear hints of Art Deco and Frank Lloyd Wright, with a dash of 20th-Century-sci-fi thrown in.My exploration of form is rooted in my passion for design, invention and technology. From the artful drawings of Leonardo Di Vinci to the computer generated creations of Industrial Light and Magic, I am inspired by the human imagination and I strive to understand the hidden unifying principals that shape our understanding of the world and are the genesis of our best creations. Formula XW-1 My work explores the fusion of the disciplines of architecture, industrial design and fine art. Each piece is as much a realization of an abstract design concept as it is a unique work of three-dimensional art.Citadel Iteration #1 A strict and systematic organization of components define this work and manifest a distinct unifying methodology that has both physical and spiritual origins. At first glance, the geometric forms seem strangely familiar as if seen somewhere before - but where - when? Upon closer examination - perhaps the designs are remnants of some distant and secrete civilization or even an, as of yet, unknown and mysterious future. The forms are intentionally abstract giving shape to that initial \"spark\" of design inspiration. Schematic concepts emerge as built objects without the practical or functional restrictions that necessarily accompany the development of an architectural or industrial product. Flying Fortress The final sculpted artwork is usually derived from an initial \"thumbnail\" sketch. The preliminary shapes are often explored and refined through multiple iterations as 3-d computer models. The work combines the \"tried and true\" techniques of old-fashioned craftsmanship with today's most advanced rapid prototyping technologies such as CAD modeling, 3-D printing, and CNC fabrication. From creation through completion this dichotomy of 'handmade' and 'computer generated' informs the development and execution of the work.Citadel Iteration #2 Particular finish applications such as weathering and rust recall an 'earlier time' in the story of certain pieces - the scars of a past life. Nevertheless, the work has a timeless quality - seeming to exist in the past, the present and the future - simultaneously.Industrial Icon Obier has plenty more to see here.",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/135545/Design-Competition-Redesign-Democracy-Calls-for-Better-Voting-Booth-Designs",
    "description": "If you're a politically-minded industrial designer, it can be tough to draw a straight line between the work you do and the political system. However, Germany's University of Fine Arts Hamburg (HFBK Hamburg) along with their Federal University of Applied Administrative Sciences, funded by the Volkswagen Foundation, are trying to bridge the gap. They're sponsoring \"Redesign Democracy—Reimagining Voting,\" a design competition that seeks to create a better ballot box.Democracy thrives on participation—the moment when citizens cast their vote in an election is one of the most central expressions of democratic participation. But how does the act of voting affect us? Currently, there is often a gap between aspiration and reality: in some places, simple containers, sometimes converted garbage cans, serve as ballot boxes. It is time to rethink the meaningful act of voting and its context—in terms of design, space, and performance. As part of the research project ReDeRe, the HFBK Hamburg is organizing a competition for the re-design of the voting process. We are inviting all designers, artists, students, researchers and citizens to take part in the competition Redesign Democracy—Reimagining Voting. The aim of the competition is to develop appropriate and visionary concepts that enhance the democratic act of voting. With your designs, you are actively shaping the future of democracy. They help to redefine the relevance and symbolism of voting. Be part of this forward-looking project and help to make the act of voting a visible expression of democracy!The deadline for entries is April 14, 2025.",

Taking our lead from renowned Australian architect Alistair Knox – whose iconic designs often feature on TDF – we’ve pulled together a style guide on how to get an Australian mid-century look at home, with a modern twist! Think warm timbers, paper lampshades, neutral colour palettes and pops of unexpected primary colour. See how to get the look below, with some of our top picks from our Design Directory.",

    "description": "How to fix furniture damage and painting mistakes.  Recently I painted our dining room buffet and had SO many issues during the process. I'm sharing how I fixed all of them along the way and ended up with a gorgeous result!  I know better by now...I've learned to never say to myself \"Wow! This project is going so well!\" -- because something inevitably happens right after I say it.  Definitely can't think it, and never say it out loud. 😂 I also know I should never, ever EVER tell myself that a DIY project won't take long. I've done it a million times...this will be so easy! This won't take long at all! I've done this 800 million times, what could go wrong?  I know these things, and yet this is what I did.  Here's the culprit...the wood sideboard I purchased for our dining room a few months after we moved in:  A friend of mine owned a beautiful home decor shop, and I found it there about seven years ago. I was SO in love with it, especially the cane doors.  It fit in beautifully with the \"nod\" to farmhouse style that I had going throughout our house. It's also just a really useful piece -- I store a ton of serving dishes inside.  Later I built a wall of bookcases and a window seat at the end of this room and painted the main wall a dark blue with pretty picture frame molding.  Last year I switched gears completely and painted the whole room in a warm and lovely color called Pachyderm:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

We can't live without this stuff now! This isn't a sponsored post, I just like to share things that work. If you have animals I think you'll find it worthwhile.Just a warning...these are the worst pictures you'll ever see on the blog. 😂 I can't get around not showing you so you can see how it works, so bear with me.   Our little chihuahua dog absolutely HATES going out when it's really cold out. He's fine most days, but when it's bone-chilling cold he will go in and out as fast as possible. I can't blame him!  This time of year we will occasionally find a little pee spot:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. About eight years ago I found a non-toxic pet stain spray called Furry Freshness on a Facebook ad of all places. I decided to try it out based on the raving reviews. It really is a miracle solution. I've never used anything like it! You just spray the spot enough so that it's saturated: And by the next day the stain will be gone (well, usually). Sometimes we have to spray again, but it's just the same process of saturating the stain. We've used this so many times in our house and I can't even find the spots where we sprayed.  Let it sit for the best results -- don't scrub it into the carpet, don't do anything! This was just a few hours later:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it).
