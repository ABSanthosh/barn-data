    "description": "This excellent Avants project is by Industrial Design student Juliette Masson. Done as her diploma project at ECAL, the project expores the use of more environmentally-friendly materials for technical clothing. \"Synthetic fibers are now a common feature of sportswear, including in the hiking world. These are popular for their technical properties: lightness, elasticity, low absorbency, and wrinkle resistance, among others. However, the environmental impact of these materials is significant, both during manufacture and throughout their life cycle.\" \"In response to this issue, Avants propose an alternative hiking outfit made from natural materials: Linen, selected for its thermo-regulating and hypoallergenic properties; waxed cotton, known for its durability and water-repellent qualities, chosen to provide protection against rain and abrasion.\" \"The design of these outfits drew inspiration from historical garments and their fastening systems, while being adapted for contemporary and functional use.\"",

    "description": "These UU Tiles are by Unknown Untitled, a Paris-based industrial design firm. They're essentially tile-based lamps. \"UU Tiles…began as a research initiative and evolved into a full tile collection thanks to a collaboration with a historic Normandy tile manufacturer. Challenging the prevailing focus on mobility and flexibility in interior design, UU Tiles explores sustainability via permanence and integrated functions. It comprises plain tiles, ceramic hooks, and lamps. A sense of modernity arises even though the enduring quality of the material supports the search for timeless forms.\" They've yet to release images of the hooks.While I understand the importance of experimentation in design, is it just me, or is this product crazy? Your average wall-mounted lamp can easily be installed and moved, with the biggest pain being the snaking of in-wall wiring. This one adds another level of installation complexity: It has to be part of a larger tile body, and now we're getting mastic or mortar involved, so it's never coming off of the wall.That said, the product is currently sold out, so apparently there's demand.",

    "description": "How to fix furniture damage and painting mistakes.  Recently I painted our dining room buffet and had SO many issues during the process. I'm sharing how I fixed all of them along the way and ended up with a gorgeous result!  I know better by now...I've learned to never say to myself \"Wow! This project is going so well!\" -- because something inevitably happens right after I say it.  Definitely can't think it, and never say it out loud. 😂 I also know I should never, ever EVER tell myself that a DIY project won't take long. I've done it a million times...this will be so easy! This won't take long at all! I've done this 800 million times, what could go wrong?  I know these things, and yet this is what I did.  Here's the culprit...the wood sideboard I purchased for our dining room a few months after we moved in:  A friend of mine owned a beautiful home decor shop, and I found it there about seven years ago. I was SO in love with it, especially the cane doors.  It fit in beautifully with the \"nod\" to farmhouse style that I had going throughout our house. It's also just a really useful piece -- I store a ton of serving dishes inside.  Later I built a wall of bookcases and a window seat at the end of this room and painted the main wall a dark blue with pretty picture frame molding.  Last year I switched gears completely and painted the whole room in a warm and lovely color called Pachyderm:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

    "description": "Our favorite pet stain remover spray that gets everything out with NO scrubbing!  I'm sharing a quick post about a pet stain remover we've used for years and LOVE. We can't live without this stuff now! This isn't a sponsored post, I just like to share things that work. If you have animals I think you'll find it worthwhile.Just a warning...these are the worst pictures you'll ever see on the blog. 😂 I can't get around not showing you so you can see how it works, so bear with me.   Our little chihuahua dog absolutely HATES going out when it's really cold out. He's fine most days, but when it's bone-chilling cold he will go in and out as fast as possible. I can't blame him!  This time of year we will occasionally find a little pee spot:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. About eight years ago I found a non-toxic pet stain spray called Furry Freshness on a Facebook ad of all places. I decided to try it out based on the raving reviews. It really is a miracle solution. I've never used anything like it! You just spray the spot enough so that it's saturated: And by the next day the stain will be gone (well, usually). Sometimes we have to spray again, but it's just the same process of saturating the stain. We've used this so many times in our house and I can't even find the spots where we sprayed.  Let it sit for the best results -- don't scrub it into the carpet, don't do anything! This was just a few hours later:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it).
