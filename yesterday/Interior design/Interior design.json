    "description": "Everyone's talking about the future, AI, blah blah blah. But this year we saw plenty of cool design solutions from earlier decades and centuries.Early mass production: In ancient China they developed Dragon Kilns, which run up hills. The fires at the bottom send heat throughout the entirety of the structure, enabling mass firings. In Japan, these Inuyarai bamboo slats protect businesses from dog pee and rain splatter. An old-school construction trick, used everywhere from the Swiss Alps to Japan, is using rocks to hold roofing in place. Farmers in Scandinavia have a low-tech way to make it easier for a horse and cart to reach the second story of a barn. Residents of rural Eastern Europe built these Vâltoare, a natural washing machine made by tapping into rivers. Here's a 19th-century British design for a multi-tool. Around the same time, the Shakers were building these retractable drying racks for their laundry facilities. Doctors of the era, meanwhile, examined patients on one of these. Hopefully it was padded at some point. Moving into the 20th century, we find this clever design for a no-tools-required-to-install hanging hook. The design persists today. Architect Fabrizio Batoni designed these Art Deco faucets by reaching into manufacturer Mamoli's back catalog, circa 1938. Industrial designer Bruno Munari designed this Cubo, a modernist ashtray, around 1954.Image: Di Albertozanardo - CC BY-SA 4.0 Arne Jacobsen's Cylinda ashtray is another carcinogenic classic, circa late '50s/early '60s. Legendary Italian industrial designer Enzo Mari designed his Formosa and Timor perpetual calendars in the 1960s. They're still in production. Spanish industrial designer Rafael Marquina designed his classic no-drip oil cruet in 1961. It too is still in production.While this might look like an ashtray, it's actually for storing jewelry. It's part of a 1970s line of ceramic objects by Italian industrial designer Robert Grigato. This Wildo Fold-A-Cup, a classic Swedish design, first went into production in 1979. It's still on the market (with a slight materials update). Here's to hoping we encounter more objects in 2025 that have withstood the test of time.",

    "description": "Two pandemic-inspired trends that have lasted through 2024: Somewhat paradoxically, people are spending more time at home, as well as spending a lot of time outdoors. Here are the innovations we saw this year aimed at both of those environments.To meet a German client's needs, Polish architecture firm KWK Promes developed this privacy fencing that appears at the push of a button.In Austria, Germany, Italy and Switzerland, these roller shutters are common. They resemble the rolldown gates urban American stores used to protect their businesses, but here the application is domestic, allowing homeowners to black out a room in seconds. In a village in Canada, residents are used to visiting bears destroying their privacy fences. Some neighborhood kids devised this outside-of-the-box solution.This homeowner hacked a way for his robot dog to help him out with yardwork.Worried about your tissue box blowing away in a strong breeze? Japanese design firm Form Design Studio created this tissue box made out of iron. Canadian firm Bateman Labs has a new take on work-from-home and gaming set-ups. They've devised a new furniture category: Modular armchair-based workstations and gaming stations. Tracing paper patterns onto fabric is time-consuming. This hi-tech Ditto system projects the patterns directly onto your fabric. In an effort to combat clutter, industrial design firm Kritzer came up with this unusual U-shaped power strip. No room for a laundry rack? Singaporean company Good Living offers this hi-tech automatic ceiling-mounted retractable laundry rack. Running out of space in the kitchen? Japanese company Yamazaki offers this add-on kitchen drawer and worksurface. A company called Rinseroo has harnessed the properties of thermoplastic rubber to create this Slip-On Tub Hose. U.S. Gymnastics coped with this year's sweltering Olympic Village by bringing in BedJets, which are in-bed air conditioning systems. Chinese company Xiaomi designed a draft-free air conditioner that exploits cool air's tendency to sink. If you're DIY'ing your house's interior, Trusscore is a user-friendly sheetrock alternative. Moving outside the house, the Bola Grill Master is a low-tech design for a barbecue grill with height-adjustable cooking surfaces. A similar take, with a different execution: The Takibi Stand, a space-saving Japanese alternative to the barbecue grill. Also from Japan comes this Square Kettle, which the manufacturer says boils water faster. Meant to cope with uneven ground, this camping table from Ruck \u0026 River only has one leg. For those who prefer four legs, French company Fixmotion's self-stabilizing outdoor tables get rid of wobble on uneven surfaces.Veteran tent designer Jake Lah created this Cot Tent for Helinox. No more sleeping on that cold, hard ground. Gear Aid's Heroclip is a carabiner with a swing-out hook and a pivot. Australian industrial design firm Tricycle re-thinks the design of the overlanding water tank with their G-Series. And finally, Gnara's GoFly zipper design makes it easy for women to pee outdoors.",

These photo ornament ideas are so easy to DIY and add a personal touch to your Christmas tree! I'm sharing a few I've done over the years, including my most recent (and favorite!) version.  I love celebrating the events and special moments of each year by adding photos to our holiday decor, and the tree is the perfect place to display them.  EASY PHOTO TREE Years ago I did the simplest version of this by printing out photos from my phone and just tucking them into the tree:  src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiCBL9fbCRJYY0gvqMUkpJuRTMiPy5SlQ8g_6Vz4eaX2zLUs488PvDMbGERx2pUT6Z-gsAxv-3bhb_2WZZYOq9moH0J_LwBitaC5YYlHQ_4FJLPxFyf-jxM2I4FGtKAC-3BJA8w0NbDX2Az9ODJXqzyJPmC45vsFo_ndIl-4xIxtfdNGX_UXevASpNNKis/s16000/DIY%20photo%20tree.jpeg\"\u003e I mean...you can't get easier than this!  For a nostalgic touch, I edited them with a sepia tone before printing.  This tree decorated with photos was so sweet and I loved looking through the pictures throughout the season. It was surprisingly pretty on the tree too!:  src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgrVHo4ZXljYxvIHfPXwe3DWq94sue5PfOOMUJrjk_8N1FAMXIz1uB88_MLbUAGfCrYfJ6I3s_dorlkhgqSOtjK-HNtsIdGYWYFvfymFUA76KEkUzgmE0gt9OrxYtBy6bwF59fwLEzvXn_zP4ejFNb6NghgTIE6iK0OyuOmUkGZMSqw1RAk6Qb0uhjOv20/s16000/sepia%20photos%20on%20tree.jpeg\"\u003e This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

Is that just me? :)  Well this is a great way to add a little something sentimental that doesn't overwhelm the tree or your decor.  ACRYLIC DIY ORNAMENTS A couple years ago I added some DIY photo ornaments to our mud room chalkboard. This was a fun one and was super inexpensive and easy to do! I took some round acrylic ornaments from the craft store and used Mod Podge to glue the photos to the back: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Twelve moody holiday art prints that make inexpensive holiday decor. One of my favorite inexpensive ways to add some festive holiday touches around the house is with printable art. I replace random framed art here and there with pretty Christmas prints.  It's SO easy to either print these at home, or send off to a quick printing service like CVS or Walgreens. I usually use smaller sizes like 8x10 and below, but you can have larger sized printed and shipped to you in a few days.  I've shared a ton of FREE Christmas printables that you can download and print at home for next to nothing.  Today I've rounded up twelve moodier prints for the season that give such a cozy vibe, I love them all! All of these are under $5 (at the time of this post).  If you saw my Santa-themed foyer last week, you saw the beautiful Santa art I used there:  src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqgR6aOhYkqJOPvCvmzcJR1MoK05_T76bTBz_MrYPxN0i9l8mgExy6igBDumcIANvr4w3fS4LhU0XXxeW1c_HipeWpWT7MPZmw6tSsv4JA9v8pXxt1Wcqmgze_xab3reXyNs33P-R6afoVr-xjOZvplkRH3BpW0WmDD5ygCmsp5HoS9pEnjV1c_4nAnZQ/s16000/Santa%20themed%20display.jpg\"\u003e This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it). Quick note: The “Under $12.99” list isn’t the only one with items priced that low – for example, there are also two gifts under $12.99 on the kids list.

We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it. I won’t recap our entire decision to downsize (you can see the full explanation here) but the highlights are: We used to live in a 3,150 sq. ft. home in suburban Richmond, Virginia Now we live in a 1,400 sq.
