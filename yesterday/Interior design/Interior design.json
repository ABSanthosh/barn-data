    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/136242/Industrial-Designer-Sebastian-Bergne-Upgrades-the-Studio-Applebox",
    "description": "As a staple of photography studios and production sets, appleboxes are a supremely useful piece of kit. Typically made of ½\" plywood, they serve as both stools and stepstools. They're durable, long-lived and easy to make. Here's one I inherited from an NYC studio on the left—you can see the years of use on it--and a newer one that I made out of plywood scraps. (If you have a pair, you can use them as sawhorses or trestles. They come in handy in a workshop.) About a decade ago, British industrial designer Sebastian Bergne made some modified appleboxes as ancillary items for an exhibition he was participating in. \"Designed to offer visitors a moments rest whilst they watched product films,\" he writes, \"and store the exhibition catalogue beneath, they were manufactured using grey MDF board and coloured laminate.\"While the exhibition has long ended, interest in Bergne's take on the appleboxes has not. After enough people expressed interest, Bergne put his production hat on and started having his re-design manufactured in hardwood. His open-sided design allows the objects to carry or store things, and he added visual interest by beveling the edges of the components; the resultant object is fittingly named Bevel. Bergne produces them in Maple, Oak and stained Beech. The handsome pieces are more objets d'esign than utility pieces; whereas a studio applebox will run you $50 to $70, Bevels run £275 (USD $354).",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/136241/Hyundais-Gaming-Inspired-Insteroid-Concept",
    "description": "This unassuming-looking vehicle, which most Americans haven't seen… …is the Inster, a compact EV that Hyundai rolled out in their home market of South Korea last year. For an EV, it's not particularly quick—0-62 mph in 10.6 seconds—but it offers a decent 229-mile range and tops out at 93 mph. Most importantly, it's affordably priced (it starts at the equivalent of USD $25,000), and demand has been strong in both Korea and Europe; the company projects it will double their EV sales in Europe this year.Following their early market success, Hyundai decided to let their design team have some fun with the car. To further cement the car's connection with the youth market, the design team was asked to cut loose and create the Insteroid (Inster + steroid), a gaming-inspired version. The Insteroid seems designed for the track, but has an obscenely large sound system in the rear. Most notably, the Inster's fairly staid instrument cluster… …has been replaced with this deconstructed design, which mimics the way that data is conveyed to gamers on-screen: \"It's not just about how it looks, but also how it sounds and how it makes you feel,\" says Hyundai SVP Simon Loasby, who heads up the Hyundai Design Center. \"INSTEROID represents a modern take on the idea of a dream car,\" says Eduardo Ramírez, Chief Designer at Hyundai Design Europe. \"It is designed to inspire and create enthusiasm. This project allowed us to fully embrace unrestrained creativity, drawing inspiration from video games to create an emotional and engaging vision of Hyundai's brand.\" While there's no word on production plans, one thing is for sure: The regular Inster won't be coming to U.S. shores--tariffs or no tariffs. In order to share the road with our monster SUVs, U.S.-market cars need to adhere to safety standards that small cars like the Inster have difficulty meeting. Europe and the rest of the world, however, will be awash in Inster-mania.",

    "description": "Fresh and flavorful salad recipe with crunchy ramen noodles. I had the most delicious salad last week and immediately asked for the recipe from my friend. It's crunchy and sweet and has...ramen noodles! Weird, right? Hang in there, I promise it's so good!! As I age I find I like more foods. Do you find the same? I don't know if my tastes have matured over time, or that I'm just trying more foods than I used to. Up till a few years ago I didn't even like avocado -- now I could eat it with a spoon.  I actually avoided this salad at first because I didn't like most of the ingredients. Everyone raved about it though, so I had to give it a try. It was all over then...I hoarded the rest of it for myself and couldn't get enough. :) So I knew I had to share it with you! After some searching I realized this is a very popular recipe, but can vary quite a bit. It's a perfect dish for picnics or get togethers, especially in the warmer months.  This ramen salad is cold and crunchy and full of flavor: It's very quick and easy to put together! As usual, I have some edits and thoughts on the ingredients, so stay tuned.  Here's the list of ingredients: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How I organize our everyday household items throughout the house! I've been on a mission over the past few months to get our house decluttered and organized...for good!  This year I've been determined more than ever to rid our home of unneeded stuff and get all of our random household clutter organized. I don't know what got me so focused on it, but I've been a machine...we've gotten rid of so much and now (almost) everything else is nicely organized.  I feel like I'm finally getting our life in order (at least the stuff part!). We've only lived here seven years. :) I figured I'd share the ways I've organized our everyday household items throughout the house.  Keep a few things in mind as you read this! First up, I'm nearing the big 5-0 and with every year I want less and less things in our home. I thrive and function so much better in a clutter-free home, but even ten years ago that was not the case at all!  Our son recently turned 18 (!!) and will be going off to college in just a few months, so I've had more time over the past few years to tackle these types of projects. (And the days of Nerf bullets and toy clutter are gone, although I still step on the occasional Lego!)  This may sound like I've gotten rid of everything in our house, which is soooo not the case. I love my stuff. :) But what we do have, we use and enjoy AND most everything has a dedicated spot.  1. Take advantage of your closet space  Closets are great of course! But if you don't utilize them well, that storage space won't benefit your home as much as it should!  A few years ago I showed you a main floor closet had been full of random crap. At the time I called it my Monica closet (Friend's sitcom reference) because after we moved in I just chucked stuff in there. I did a quick declutter and it looked so much better!:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.     But it still wasn't functioning as well as it could. So I've been working on it here and there over the past few years.  The real organization started when I found these plastic basketweave storage bins at Big Lots a couple of years ago:  RIP to Big Lots by the way, I'm SO sad about them closing! I loved that place.  They had a taller version (pictured) and a shorter version. I grabbed a bunch of them, mostly in the larger size. I grouped like items in the bins, like tissue boxes, trash and grocery bags, medication and vitamins.  Just random household items we need throughout the day with easy access. Of course I needed a way to label them, so I used my trusty clip on bin labels: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
