    "description": "This case study is from Brooklyn-based Curve ID.JAVAR is a Colombian-based company focused on industrial kitchen equipment. For more than 30 years, JAVAR has been part of the transformation of the butcher industry in Colombia, contributing to build products that meet compliance with stricter sanitary standards. JAVAR approached us to develop an all-new range of meat grinders that will be built in Colombia and designed to meet international sanitary standards. Our process started with an in-depth research phase in which we learned how these machines are built and about the butcher industry of Colombia as well as the U.S.With these findings, we gained valuable knowledge that helped us guide the design of the project. We sketched a wide variety of different forms that give the product a robust and easy to clean look. After down-selecting our design ideas, we began to define how the machine will be manufactured, keeping the number of parts low and capable of adapting to different model sizes. After several rounds of CAD development and working closely with engineers, we had enough data to begin prototyping and testing. Our final design focused on easy-to-clean surfaces with a robust stance that communicates durability. You can see more of Curve ID's work here.",

I LOVE our kitchen, but I've planned all along to add some small details that add some interest and character.  You know character is the name of my game! My goal for the past couple decades of home ownership has been to add custom touches to our homes. :)  I started with adding \"legs\" to the sides of our island. That project made the island feel so much more substantial, and we can still access the cabinets underneath.This one is a quick project that I never had to address in our old kitchen makeover because we didn't have any exposed cabinet ends:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    Basic cabinet side panels don't bother me -- but I do see them as an opportunity to make the kitchen look more custom!  I considered a bunch of different designs, but in the end went with the simplest. My friend Jenny shared a bunch of great options for dressing up the ends of cabinets here.  First I had to remove all of the trim along the side -- the quarter round, baseboard on the wall and the trim along the back of the cabinet.

This time I want to share the transformation of our teenage son's closet. I spared you the true before images.
