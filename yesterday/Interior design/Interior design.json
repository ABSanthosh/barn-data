    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/134079/Fantastic-Industrial-Design-Student-Work-A-3-in-1-Walking-Aid",
    "description": "This incredibly thorough Pedestrian project is by Jonas Krämer and Ayla Warncke, Industrial Design students at Germany's Hochschule Hannover.Pedestrian3 in 1 Assistance System Pedestrian is a walking aid aimed at people with a medium-term walking disability and anyone who needs assistance. It fills the product gap between short-term solutions such as forearm crutches, which are designed for six weeks of use, and long-term assistance systems, such as wheelchairs. The focus of the product is the minimization of consequential damages, which often occur in connection with conventional walking aids and thus result in further disorders of the musculoskeletal system, as well as a pleasant and practical handling, which enables the affected persons to actively participate in social life even with their walking disability. The assistance system can be transformed with only a few hand movements and thus allows an adaptation of the walking aid to the affected persons and their respective assistance needs.The mobility of each and every individual is central to the self-determined shaping of a proactive life!Arthritis SupportMode 1 - strong support Forearm CrutchMode 2 - med. supportWalking StickMode 3 - light support Use and pass on!Due to the transformability of Pedestrian, the number of people who can use the system in-creases. Moreover, due to its modularity, the walker can be adapted even after the first cycle of use. Each element is interchangeable and can be adapted to the needs of the person using it.Easy switching between modes allows you to easily get started with the system and supports you even if you ever take a step backwards. It can be chosen between use as an arthritis support, forearm crutch and walking stick. During the development of the walking aid, special attention was paid to ergonomic design to ensure comfortable use.Pedestrian wants to optimistically accompany the using persons in their process and encourage them to deal with their limitation as confidently as possible. Self-standing and compressiblePedestrian stands all by itself in any mode and can be easily compressed. Stand-up aidPedestrian helps you get up and is always at hand.Allows social interactionPedestrian still lets you say hello to your friends and focuses on you, not your impairment. Hands-free usablePedestrian is hands-free! You can make calls, text your friends and find the way to your next destination.More safety by wrist strapPedestrian offers you additional safety with a hand strap, even in walking stick mode you have your hands free. The tube cap with wrist strap forms the end of the tube part that is otherwise left open and provides additional safety and connection to the wrist with the wrist strap. The blinding of the push buttons is a deliberate design decision to disguise the mechanical nature of the walker and make it easier to push the buttons. The base of the walking aid is the foot, which allows the walking aid to stand independently due to its large diameter. The flexible rubber material of the foot allows it to adapt to any conceivable surface. The textured profile of the foot prevents slipping on wet and slippery surfaces without leaving any marks on the floor. The 4 mm profile depth ensures the preservation of the profile even after several months of use. In case of wear and tear on the foot, a straightforward replacement is possible. The inner valuesInside the tube is a novel mechanism for adjusting the height. A fitted continuous casting profile allows precise and easy adjustment of the height. A simple twist locks and unlocks the tube.The accuracy of adjustment is twice as high as with conventional walking aids. The handle serves as a bridge between the tube and the arm section, and an internal aluminum cylinder connects both elements positively and non-positively.The ergonomically designed handle supports the ball of the hand and prevents overuse of the wrist. Human-centeredUnlike conventional walking aids, Pedestrian puts people in the foreground rather than their limitations. In its design, the technoid and strictly medical character that many walking aids have was consciously avoided. Soft forms emphasize the ergonomic, more human shape of Pedestrian, while a refined color spectrum encourages a self-confident approach to the limitation.This project was designed in collaboration with Ayla Warncke.Pedestrian is an expression of our firm belief in a truly inclusive society that enables all people to live experientially beyond their basic needs.",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/134077/An-Electric-Hydrofoil-Designed-by-Marc-Newson",
    "description": "This MN Series eFoil is a personal electric hydrofoil, produced by Australian company Flite and designed by Marc Newson. The rider controls it using a wireless hand controller, also designed by Newson.Driven by the necessary technical constraints of eFoil technology, Marc's design focuses on streamlining the functionality and manufacturing processes to create a product with increased strength and stiffness, and reduced drag. Weighing less than 20 kg, the MN Series is the world's lightest eFoil. The monobloc construction of the high-modulus, pre-preg carbon fibre board, together with the mast and fuselage system, reduces assembly and joins, in turn making the board lighter. The board is reduced in size from Flite's other offerings, further decreasing weight. The eFoil features titanium accents on its front wing and board, another lightweight, hardwearing, and anti-corrosive material to safeguard the board from salt water. Voronoi patternThis naturally forming pattern is found everywhere from turtle shells and spotted eagle rays. Newson borrowed the pattern from nature to create the functional and distinctive deck grip. Clean linesFlush mount silicone handles are sleek and discreet. There when you need them and integrated when you're flying. Stunning simplificationA singular battery-release mechanism is simple, durable and striking. Like every Fliteboard, battery levels, board health, connection and pairing status are displayed on the minimalist Flitecell lightbar.",

    "description": "How to spray paint cabinet hardware and get a perfect finish! You can give your kitchen or bathroom cabinets a new look by spray painting your knobs and pulls instead of replacing them.I love any project involving one of my very favorite DIY \"tools\" ever -- spray paint!I've blabbed on and on about my love of spray paint for years now. It's one of the easiest and least expensive ways to completely transform an item or room.  This transformation was in the kitchen and I'm really happy with how it turned out. I've added an update on this hardware and how it held up at the end of this post! When I was picking out the finishes for this house, I went much \"softer\" and lighter than I had in the past.  It felt right at the time, as we were starting fresh. But I quickly discovered that I am a contrast lover through and through. Almost immediately I was craving it. I started painting walls super dark, hung dark wallpaper and changed out some lighting for bigger and bolder options.  This project involved our kitchen handles:  I picked a lovely brass handle that looks GREAT. I loved the handles and the color was gorgeous! But they didn't feel substantial enough -- it was something I noticed every time I walked into the kitchen. I bought a set of black handles just to see if I liked them:  We loved them! But it would have been kind of spendy to replace all of the hardware. And ours are really nice, I just wanted to change the color.  So...spray paint to the rescue!I've spray painted bathroom and kitchen handles in the past and it's a really easy DIY project. Spray paint is a GREAT way to ease into do-it-yourself projects. For this one I used the Krylon Fusion All-in-one spray paint to paint our hardware:      I wanted a slightly more modern feel so I went with the satin black. It leans towards a matte finish but is not dull at all.  The easiest way to spray paint cabinet hardware. Spraying hardware can be tricky because you need to get all the angles. Sometimes it's difficult to access it all. My friend Lindsay shared this brilliant tip for spraying pulls and knobs:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
