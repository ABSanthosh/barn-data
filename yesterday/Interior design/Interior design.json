    "description": "First built in the 1500s, Osaka Castle has been destroyed, rebuilt and repaired over the years. In the early 1900s one of the wooden columns supporting the castle's main gate, known as the Otemon Gate, rotted out at the bottom. Craftsmen patched this in 1923 with this peculiar splice:I know the photo quality is poor. Here's a better photo of an identical splice joint executed by craftsman Chris Hall:Image and work: Chris Hall Following World War II, this splicing technique had been lost. Japanese craftsmen in the latter part of the 20th century had no idea how this splice was installed.In 1983, the joint was X-rayed. The joint was reverse-engineered, and Japanese craftsmen (and eventually Western craftsmen like Chris Hall*) learned to make it again.Here's how the mysterious joint goes together. I've cued this up to the right spot:The joint is referred to both by its technical name, basara-tsugi, and colloquially as the \"Otemon splice.\"It's one thing to see how it goes together; it's another to make the joint on-site. Imagine trying to chisel that thing out, upside-down, on the rotted column while it's in place. I imagine installation on-site is similarly fiendish; if you cannot jack the entire structure up, you'd need to remove foundation stones (in Japanese timber framing, the posts often rest on stacked stone pilings dug into the ground) to have the space to wedge the replacement part in.----*Chris Hall was a highly skilled craftsman who shared his knowledge on his website, The Carpentry Way, until his passing in 2020. Hall's widow maintains the website in Chris' memory. If you're interested in woodworking, I highly recommend checking it out.",

    "description": "Some luxury automakers, like Lexus, offer built-in sun shades that you can slide up to cover the side windows. For those with cars lacking this feature, the only option has been to deal with janky aftermarket offerings that rely on suction cups. From Australia, a country well familiar with sun-baked car interiors, comes these SnapShades. These are model-specific and feature metal frames with integrated neodymium magnets; they not only fit your car perfectly, but simply magnetically cling to your car's existing windowframes. They're made of thin \"memory steel\" and can be folded away when not in use. Perfect fit, easy installation, can even roll the windows down They also make opaque windshield models for when you're parked. The company offers units that will fit over 200 different car, SUV and truck models across 69 automakers. You can check for your vehicle on their website. Prices obviously vary by model, but start around USD $36 per window and $52 per pair. The windshield versions start around USD $105.",

    "description": "How to stain a fiberglass entry door in a rich wood color.  One of the most common questions I get is about the stain we used on our wood front door. Turns out our door isn't wood, but it is stained to look like it.  Did you know you can stain a fiberglass door and it will look just like wood? I didn't realize this until we built our current house. I had no idea you could use stain on anything but wood, and I've been at this DIY thing for a long time! We have a Therma Tru door set with sidelites (see specifics of our indoor and outdoor home finishes here) and picked the stain color called English Walnut.  Our front door doesn't get much of the elements because it's protected on our front porch. But even without the wind and rain hitting it directly, the dark stain was still super faded nearly eight years later.  I'm prepping for our son's high school graduation party, and this DIY project was on my list! The process wasn't nearly as difficult as I thought it would be. There are only a few simple steps in this application, they just take some time. The before photos of the door finish didn't look as horrible as in real life, but it was faded, worn out and chipping in some spots: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

Over the years I've come up with quite a few ways to save on both annual and perennial plants this time of year. Sometimes I will still splurge on a plant or tree, but for the most part these methods will save me a TON on flowers, bushes and trees for our gardens and yard. I've planted or replanted a TON of plants this spring (most were small, individual flowers) and have loved watching them thrive. I gathered my top five ways to save on plants this spring and summer! 1. Pick spreading plantsI love our window boxes, but they can be expensive to fill every spring. I learned years ago that using flowers that spread will make my money go a lot further. My favorite has always been the Wave Petunias because they multiply like crazy and cascade out of boxes or containers: These are the only annual flowers I plant each year because they spread and fill in so beautifully. Annuals only last one season, perennials will come back year after year.For your landscaping, look for ground cover or flowers that spread, like this awesome sedum plant I showed you years ago:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
