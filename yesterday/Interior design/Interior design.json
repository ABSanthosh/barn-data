    "description": "Sprout is an industrial design consultancy that not only does design work, but invests in promising startups. They spied a business opportunity in Yardhaus, a startup that focuses on enhancing outdoor living space.At Home, Outside: Introducing YARDHAUS, a Sprout Ventures-Backed CompanyIntroA major home trend in home improvement is the transition of indoor lifestyle elements to the outdoor areas of the home, outfitting decks, patios, and porches with the same comfort, convenience, and technology typically only found inside. As the founders of YARDHAUS sought to transform their outdoor spaces, they discovered there were no existing string light hanging systems. Recognizing a gap in the market, they sought a solution that enhances the aesthetic appeal of outdoor spaces while simplifying the installation process.Sprout Ventures saw this as a prime investment opportunity, perfectly aligning with our entrepreneurial nature and commitment to supporting innovative, early-stage startups. As part of our business model, we invest in startups by taking part-equity and part-cash payments in exchange for our services. The companies we invest in leverage the full breadth of Sprout's multidisciplinary team to propel projects from concept to launch, ensuring a comprehensive approach to development and market success.The ChallengeTackling Inefficiencies in Outdoor IlluminationYARDHAUS partnered with Sprout to design the Pillar Pro Deck System to address the problem of a complete lack of viable string light installation products. Traditional methods often required ad hoc solutions from big-box hardware retailers, resulting in a time-consuming and frustrating experience– one that didn't really solve anything. The Pillar Pro system offers a streamlined solution, revolutionizing how homeowners enhance their outdoor spaces.The ApproachDesigning the Ultimate Outdoor Lighting ExperienceLeveraging the full breadth of Sprout's multidisciplinary team, we developed the YARDHAUS Pillar Pro Deck System, ensuring a premium blend of simplicity, elegance, and functionality. Our comprehensive approach encompassed the full Sprout service profile – product research, insights and strategy, industrial design, branding, packaging, merchandising, marketing collateral development, product rendering, and animation – culminating in a premium solution that revolutionizes outdoor lighting installations. Product DesignOur industrial design team developed the Pillar Pro Deck System to embody simplicity and sophistication. Comprising just two primary components—the Crown Elite anchor and Pillar Pro pole—the design facilitates effortless string light installation and adjustment, ensuring a hassle-free experience for users. Its sleek and minimalist aesthetic seamlessly blends with any outdoor setting, enhancing the ambiance while complementing existing decor and architectural elements. BrandingThe brand team crafted the identity by defining key attributes, shaping the brand's personality, and establishing its voice. The outcome aims to evoke an air of poise and refinement, characterized by a serene color palette, assured simplicity, and a visually straightforward design language. Every touchpoint is designed for a consistent and compelling brand experience in every interaction. Package DesignWe designed a comprehensive structural and graphic packaging system for the YARDHAUS product line. Through rigorous testing and refinement, the packaging solution not only safeguards the product but also enhances its shelf appeal, effectively communicating its quality to consumers with a premium unboxing experience. MerchandisingSprout developed engaging retail displays that highlight the features and benefits of the Pillar Pro system, enticing customers with the promise of transforming their outdoor spaces with ease and style. The retail displays are designed to seize shoppers' attention, swiftly communicate benefits, and maintain interest with a simple and inviting appeal. Product RenderingThroughout the design and development process, Sprout's in-house visualization team played a pivotal role in bringing the Pillar Pro system to life. Photorealistic 3D renderings and videos provided stakeholders with compelling visuals that accelerated the go-to-market timeline and garnered support from retailers and investors alike.Insights and StrategyOur strategic approach began with in-depth product research to define clear objectives and milestones. By analyzing user behavior and market trends, we identified key pain points and opportunities for innovation. The Sprout team developed a naming strategy that supports future expansion, and a comprehensive product roadmap to align the YARDHAUS vision with market needs. The OutcomeRedefining Outdoor AmbianceYARDHAUS has garnered rave reviews on platforms like Amazon, with users praising its quality and ease of use. Beyond its lighting capabilities, the Pillar Pro system is poised for future expansion, with plans to expand into accessories supporting outdoor areas of the home with the same comfort, convenience, and technology typically only found inside.

    "description": "Tips to easily purge and declutter items from your home!Have you caught the decluttering bug yet this year? Is there anything better after the busyness and STUFF of the holiday season? The first few weeks of this year I was a decluttering FIEND. It's been a long time since I've focused so much on purging things from our house. It's been almost ten years since I went through our entire (old) house and decluttered EV.ER.Y.THING. Back then I wrote about how much I like the Konmari decluttering method and how I used it. The Konmari decluttering method.I think the part that can turn people off from this method is the main message -- asking yourself if the items in your home bring you joy. If not, let go of them. I mean, it's a little simplistic. I don't LOVE the whisk in our kitchen drawer, so why keep it? 😂 So when I use this process I focus on things that I truly enjoy and we use often. These two qualifiers make it much easier to figure out what to keep!Notice I said keep. This method makes me focus more on the things that I love, not things that don't serve us well. If I like and use it...it's easier to keep it in our home. If it doesn't fit, I don't like the color, isn't my style anymore AND I haven't used it in years...then I let it go without a second thought. For some reason, deciding what to keep is easier for me than determining what to give away. The Komari decluttering process worked so well for me, I've been really good at constantly asking myself those questions as I go about day to day life in our home. It's not unusual for me to donate a small bag of items every week. Home decor decluttering process.But after the holidays, I knew it was time to tackle a spot I never focus on. Our basement storage room is wonderful and has plenty of room to store items away, but it becomes a dumping ground (especially after Christmas).A few years ago I made an effort to organize the home decor items I was holding onto for future projects:This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.When I think back to how much STUFF we moved into this house almost eight years ago, I truly can't believe it. Even after doing the major purge before we moved, I did another HUGE home decor declutter about a year after we moved in. I still had a lot, knowing I would be building a few built ins around the house that would need decor. Now that the family room, office, dining and basement bookcases and builds are done, I can let go of a bunch. Right after Christmas, I stood in front of those plastic shelves and realized there was very little I had a desire to keep. When it hits, it hits. I wanted it GONE. Ha! I say this all the time, but the with each year of my life, I want less stuff in our house. At least stuff that isn't meaningful. In my 20's and 30's I often kept more than needed. I know that was a response to a difficult childhood -- it used to pain me to get rid of something I had spent money on. (Even if it was 20 years earlier.)So I gathered like items and placed them on a table so I could see what I was dealing with: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How to make DIY sliding shoe cubbies for the mud room!These sliding shoe storage boxes were an easy fix for one of our problem areas!We have a great bench in our mud room/laundry combo with a ton of space, but it was lacking a spot for us to toss shoes on the way in the door. It was a spot that bugged me since we moved in: I started some mud room updates last year and added the shiplap wall, no sew cushion and long pillow. It made a huge difference in here and I LOVE this half of the room! The only part that bugged me were the baskets underneath the bench. I used what we had when we moved in, but they drove me absolutely crazy. They shed everywhere and didn't hold their shape. I knew I'd build something eventually to replace them. It's pretty complex though...get ready for this super elaborate DIY.  I built...a BOX:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   Ha! Well, two boxes. You'll notice I used inexpensive, low quality plywood for most of this build -- because it holds shoes. Dirty shoes. I don't need the inside to be pretty. :) Once you get the measurements figured out, building one is super easy. It's figuring out the exact dimensions that takes the longest.  I had my wood cut down at Lowe's and that made this go super quick. My shoe boxes are 14 inches tall and 20 inches wide, but of course if you try this out you'll want to make them to fit your space.  I didn't use jigs or anything -- just nailed it together with my nail gun and it's super sturdy. I laid the bottom piece on the ground, then surrounded it with the sides. (You can see how I constructed it if you look at that pic above.)I made the front and back pieces wider (20 inches) so they cover up the rough edges on the front.  I used a nicer, paint grade plywood for the front panels so it would paint up nicely. After a few coats I put them in place and realized they definitely needed a little something:  They were functional but super boring. :)  My thin lattice trim molding to the rescue! I painted some scrap that I had in the garage and did a simple frame around the front. Be sure to check out all the ways I've used that lattice trim over the years!  After that I added a long, heavy duty handle to the front of each shoe box...and they were done!:  I wanted them to look as built in as possible, so instead of wheels I put a few large felt pads on the bottom:  They slide in and out super easy because our tile is so smooth. (I tested that out before building them -- if you use wheels remember you'll have to adjust the height of your boxes!) At first I was worried they wouldn't hold as many shoes, because we could stuff so much in the baskets. Turns out these are HUGE and hold plenty!:  No, I didn't paint the inside. We're the only ones that will see in there. Pick your battles my friends! :) They turned out even better than I had envisioned! And they are SO super functional, I'm so happy to have those baskets out of here!:  The handles actually work great, because nine times out of ten I'm using my feet to pull them open and closed. 😂 If you would do the same, make sure to get long hardware for the front.  SO. much. cleaner. Achieving both form and function always makes me happy!: They only took me a few hours total -- I wish I would tackled this way sooner. These would also be a great option for under the bed storage! Just use carpet sliders underneath instead of the felt. :) Here are more details about this room if you're interested: no sew bench cushion long lumbar pillow fabric -- Joann's DIY shiplap wall wood framed mirror  cubby canvas bins -- Hobby Lobby  black and brass sconces long black hardware -- Lowe's   Check out this huge laundry/mud room makeover here!: See more of our home and shop items in each room here.Never miss a post by signing up to get posts via email.   This content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Never heard of Ocean Springs, Mississippi? Neither had we! But it caught our eye on round-ups like Southern Living's 15 Most Adorable Small Towns and USA Today's 10 Best Coastal Small Towns where it ranked #1. So a few months ago our family decided to check it out for ourselves. It did NOT disappoint! We actually considered detouring through Ocean Springs on our weekend trip to New Orleans two years ago. But now we're glad we didn't shortchange it with a quick pitstop and gave it a full trip of its own. Continue reading A Weekend Getaway To Ocean Springs at Young House Love.",

    "description": "Just like we did for our 2023 Gift Guides and our 2022 Gift Guides, we’ve got all three of our gift lists in one singular post right here. So let’s dive right into the 3 categories that we cover each year: Gift Ideas for Grown-Ups Gift Ideas for Kids Gift Ideas Under $12.99 Every year that we make these, we love including actual things that we own and enjoy, as well as things that we’re buying for others (like our own kids, each other, and relatives/friends). Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it). Quick note: The “Under $12.99” list isn’t the only one with items priced that low – for example, there are also two gifts under $12.99 on the kids list.
