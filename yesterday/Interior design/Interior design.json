What people want is toast.\"The times have definitely changed, if the success of this Vaaka device is any indication. It's an analog scale designed to provide \"a meditative exploration of the balance between coffee and life.\" It adds several steps to your coffeemaking process, I suppose to deliver a \"curated\" exercise in tactility. Here's how you're meant to use it: To paraphrase Mitch Hedberg, I don't need another step between me and coffee. But I am not the target market. This project has been successfully Kickstarted, and to me it suggests people enjoy experiencing rituals with objects, and/or they're craving tactility, the manipulation of tools to achieve an aim. Which makes sense to me, given the digital nature of modern life. That being the case, I can't criticize the object directly. I think of objects like this not as a symptom of an ailing society, but as the antibodies that show up to reveal that there is an unseen ailment.",

We'll leave it to design historians to debate.Steelcase's Ocular line of conference tables are designed for modern reality, where videoconferencing has become the norm. Whereas pre-videoconferencing tables were always symmetrical in two axis, the designers have now chopped off the screen-facing end. \"Ocular tables were designed to accommodate the increasing need for video conferences in meeting rooms and hybrid collaboration spaces. ?The organic shapes allow everyone – whether in the room or elsewhere – to see, connect and meet better.\" \"Ocular table shapes were intentionally designed around three key sightlines for people participating in a virtual meeting – people to people, people to screens, people to cameras.\" These were co-designed and co-developed with Microsoft.",

    "description": "A tour of our FUN and playful basement Halloween decor. I decorate our main living areas for fall every year (fall decor tour coming soon!), but the outside of our house and basement family room is where I have FUN with Halloween decor. I started going all in on the Halloween down in the basement a few years when one of my sisters and I started a Hocus Pocus movie night tradition with our kids. Her kids are younger so I go crazy with Halloween decorating. Nothing too spooky, and nothing is perfectly styled just so. We did our movie night last week and I thought it would be fun to share how I decorate this space for the month of October. I finished building our kitchenette (from the ground up!) earlier this year, and it's been fun to add some seasonal items down there. Most items in this space are from HomeGoods over the years. The large ceramic ghost was a Michael's find earlier this year: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. He's paintable but I left him as is for now.

    "description": "How to make these easy and fun floating witch hats for your front porch or inside! I've wanted to make these cute DIY \"floating\" luminary witch hats for our porch for years! They turned out to be a really easy way to add some cute Halloween decorations to our front porch, but you could hang them anywhere for easy decor. I tried a couple methods of creating these hanging hats with two lighting options, and I'll share both here. Both are very simple, but one is so simple it only take a couple minutes to create each witch hat luminary.  I started with these inexpensive black witch hats:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    This witch hat set came with 12 hats and a bunch of cute plastic bat cutouts as well. (This set has six hats if you don't need as many.)  My first tutorial uses LED votives that operate on a timer -- once you turn them on, they'll run for a certain amount of time. So turn them on in the evening and they'll operate every evening after. I used fishing line for this project because you want the hats to look as though they're floating around on your porch. :) If you don't have that on hand, dental floss works as well. (These don't weigh much!)  How to make your witch hats glow I tied the line around the \"flame\" of the votives: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
