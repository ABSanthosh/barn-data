    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/134903/A-More-Modern-Interpretation-of-the-Cuckoo-Clock",
    "description": "The cuckoo clock is a truly bizarre combination of engineering and artistry. Their origin story is murky and difficult to swallow:The accepted lore is that they were invented and produced by farmers in the Black Forest region of Germany in the 1800s. Farmers, the tale goes, turned to producing these in their winter months to make money. I say hard to swallow, because this means: The farmers not only knew how to farm, but had enough engineering skills to build clocks; had the skills to construct the miniature bellows-and-pipes mechanism that imitated a cuckoo call; and had the woodworking skills to pull it all together, hand-carving each wooden gear with mechanical precision, as well as the elaborate fascia, which required more artistry.In any case, a modern-day craftsperson in Turkiye is selling these cuckoo clocks that look like they're from the 1970s. \"The cuckoo bird comes out, chirps, flaps its wings and make the cuckoo sound every hour than goes back inside. Cuckoo count changes regarding time. (For example when it is 11 AM the cuckoo sound counts 11 times.)The clock is silent between 10 PM to 5 AM. (Last cuckoo at 9 PM and First cuckoo at 6 AM.)The clocks are powered by three C batteries (not included). Multiple color options are offered:If you want to hear what the cuckoo sounds like, there's an (unembeddable) video here.These start at $485.",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/134904/A-Hardwood-Floor-Where-You-Can-Actually-Remove-One-Piece-at-a-Time",
    "description": "Standard hardwood flooring features a tongue-and-groove arrangement to lock each piece into place. However, the interlocking set-up means that should you need to remove a damaged piece, or access the subfloor for some maintenance reason, you must take up the entire floor until you reach the relevant piece.A Pennsylvania-based company called Steller Floors has developed an alternative to the tongue and groove. At first blush, the company's logo seems a strange one for a flooring company……until you realize it represents their innovation: An extruded plastic spline. By 3D-printing a plank that would snap neatly into the spline, the company worked out the right profile they'd use to cut into hardwood. Their resultant flooring product can easily be laid by a DIY'er. To firm each piece up, you simply step on it with your foot. And should you ever need to remove a piece, you can pull up just that piece, using a suction cup. You can also install these herringbone-style.And now for the sticker shock: Their least-expensive option is a 5/8\" thick Oak at $10/foot. (I assume that the cost of the splines is in there.) If you want to step up to 3/4\" Oak, it's $11/foot. More exotic species (Walnut, Hickory, etc.) are $20/foot. Innovation doesn't come cheap.",

    "description": "Christmas decor storage ideas and hacks that will make next year's decorating easier!I've figured out some great holiday storage solutions over the years that have helped to keep our Christmas decor better organized. These methods have made pulling out decor for the next Christmas much more efficient. These little tips save my sanity each November when the holiday decor comes out and when I put them away for the year. In general I find packing holiday decor away is faster and easier than setting it up! Am I the only one? I quite like the process, it feels cathartic to clean up the house and simplify everything for the new year. Here are my Christmas decor organization methods and a few tips I've figured out along the way!  1. Label your decor for next year My first tip is to label as much as you can -- especially the stuff you put up in the same spot every year. I've found over the years that labeling light strands I use for specific areas helps a TON!:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.  You can find my awesome label maker here! This smaller version works great too -- it's just a little more basic. Both are super easy to use.  I label any spot that uses more than one strand of lights -- both inside and outside. So when I get them out I know exactly how many bushes or trees are covered by that group of lights. I also label them inside, like the strands on our stair garland. That way I'm not trying to figure out how many I used the year before.  I use a LOT of these remote plugs and switches for our indoor lights. (That one is my favorite because I can use one remote for five items.) I store them away with the items that need a remote, like for the garland on our stairs. I just keep them plugged into the light strand.  I also keep any needed extension cords attached and stored away with the lights. If you have more than one set of these remotes, you know the joy of trying to figure out which one goes with which remote. ;) I label the matching sets so we know what goes with what: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "2024 Thrifty Decor Chick Christmas home decor tour!Is it me or did Christmas arrive a month earlier than usual? 😂 Anyone else feel like this season has FLOWN by? It must be because Thanksgiving was later this year? Whatever the reason, I'm way behind this year. I wanted to have this tour up weeks ago...but here we are! I hope you enjoy this Christmas home tour and it inspires you! I plan to put a video tour together, I'll update this when I get that up. The only space I didn't include this year is our basement family room and bar, but you can check out the basement tour from last year. I don't change up the holiday decor down there too much so it looks almost exactly this same this year. ;) BedroomLet's start in our bedroom! This room got a big makeover early this year when I installed some vertical tongue and groove molding to brighten up the space. I'm so pleased with how it came together. I like to add a few Christmas touches in our room every year, like our flocked, snowy tree: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    This year I did all silver and white ornaments on that tree, but didn't hang them everywhere. I kind of cascaded them around the tree, in a band of ornaments. It's just a different look and I really like how it turned out! I draped some of my favorite Norfolk greenery on our standing mirror: It needed a little something, so I made my own bell garland with some green floral wire and these tiny brass bells:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it). Quick note: The “Under $12.99” list isn’t the only one with items priced that low – for example, there are also two gifts under $12.99 on the kids list.

We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it. I won’t recap our entire decision to downsize (you can see the full explanation here) but the highlights are: We used to live in a 3,150 sq. ft. home in suburban Richmond, Virginia Now we live in a 1,400 sq.
