    "description": "When Bosch wanted to produce their own espresso maker, they leveraged both their in-house design team and Munich-based ID firm Fluid. The result was this Tassimo concept:The ChallengeDevelop an iconic range of espresso maker concepts for the Tassimo system that serves as a strong and inspiring foundation for the Bosch in-house team for further development. The SolutionThe selected concept Tassimo Finesse captures the ritual of coffee culture in the context of entry-level coffee machines. In this product range, design character and the expression of coffee pleasure are key purchase drivers. Creating a vision \u0026 narrative for in-home coffee experiences In close collaboration with the Bosch in-house design team, we created an exciting range of coffee machine concepts targeting the entry-level market with both, contextual desirability and feasibility at their core. The overall archetype, gestures and character of the selected concept Tassimo Finesse were maintained from concept stage all the way to the marketed product. The first step towards a more mature Tassimo brand expressionTassimo Finesse celebrates coffee heritage and the daily ritual we build around this beverage. The architectural design expresses culture, elegance and tradition while modern and soft details promise approachability, wittiness and joy.The proud brewing head is elevated and becomes an iconic design element, showcasing both, coffee quality and ease of use without losing the Tassimo charisma. The strong gesture of the machine displays a serving gesture, ready to accommodate the user's needs. The Story of a great partnershipThe Tassimo Finesse project serves as a perfect example of the closely-knit partnership between FLUID and the in-house teams at Bosch Home Appliances - a partnership in which we share and discuss early ideas, sketches and first product narratives, develop detailed CAD models, support each other during consumer tests and collaborate closely during design refinement.Powerful synergy effectsFor many years now, we have worked closely with the Bosch Home Appliances in-house team - on numerous projects ranging from industrial design to user interface design, user experience design, and strategic design. Over these years we have developed a deep understanding of each other and now benefit from a strong synergy between projects.You can see more of Fluid's work here.",

    "description": "When it comes to updating your home, sometimes the smallest changes can make a world of difference — and this recently refreshed 1920s bungalow proves the power of a cosmetic renovation. Editor and creative consultant Sally Tabart and her husband Jeremy bought the Melbourne home in 2019, and initially moved in with housemates. But now with the house to themselves and a baby on the way, Sally wanted the space to feel ‘a bit more grown up’. See how Sally transformed their kitchen, living room, and garden, without making a single structural change!",

    "description": "A tour of our FUN and playful basement Halloween decor. I decorate our main living areas for fall every year (fall decor tour coming soon!), but the outside of our house and basement family room is where I have FUN with Halloween decor. I started going all in on the Halloween down in the basement a few years when one of my sisters and I started a Hocus Pocus movie night tradition with our kids. Her kids are younger so I go crazy with Halloween decorating. Nothing too spooky, and nothing is perfectly styled just so. We did our movie night last week and I thought it would be fun to share how I decorate this space for the month of October. I finished building our kitchenette (from the ground up!) earlier this year, and it's been fun to add some seasonal items down there. Most items in this space are from HomeGoods over the years. The large ceramic ghost was a Michael's find earlier this year: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. He's paintable but I left him as is for now.

    "description": "How to make these easy and fun floating witch hats for your front porch or inside! I've wanted to make these cute DIY \"floating\" luminary witch hats for our porch for years! They turned out to be a really easy way to add some cute Halloween decorations to our front porch, but you could hang them anywhere for easy decor. I tried a couple methods of creating these hanging hats with two lighting options, and I'll share both here. Both are very simple, but one is so simple it only take a couple minutes to create each witch hat luminary.  I started with these inexpensive black witch hats:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    This witch hat set came with 12 hats and a bunch of cute plastic bat cutouts as well. (This set has six hats if you don't need as many.)  My first tutorial uses LED votives that operate on a timer -- once you turn them on, they'll run for a certain amount of time. So turn them on in the evening and they'll operate every evening after. I used fishing line for this project because you want the hats to look as though they're floating around on your porch. :) If you don't have that on hand, dental floss works as well. (These don't weigh much!)  How to make your witch hats glow I tied the line around the \"flame\" of the votives: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
