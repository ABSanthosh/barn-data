    "description": "In Akashi, Japan, the seaside HiPoPo PaPa restaurant boasts a rather unique bathroom. Longtime restaurant owner Koichi Miyanaga built this aquarium bathroom way back in the 1980s, though design firms all told him it was impossible.According to Japanese newspaper The Asahi Shimbun, Koichi DIY'd it with a carpenter buddy and a glassworker buddy. It took them four tries to get it right (one of the early versions cracked under the water pressure). The bathroom, which is enclosed in a stainless steel frame and double panes of 18mm-thick tempered glass, cost a staggering $284,000 to build. The tank is filled with 300 tropical fish. Cool as it is, the bathroom is staggeringly high-maintenance. Miyanaga, who's now in his 70s, spends an hour each morning cleaning the tank and filter, and his monthly water bill is ¥200,000 (USD $1,303).Miyanaga only allows female patrons to use the bathroom—they're \"cleaner users\"—though they're allowed to show it to male companions with the door open.",

    "description": "French startup Metacar Mobility Systems has developed a compact EV called Kiwee. Intended as a car sharing service in urban centers, their strange micro-vehicle can link to its brethren, front and back, creating a sort of ESG centipede. These would be stored outside of train stations, like bikeshare stations. As they sit in their station, they charge.The idea behind the linking ability, said to be inspired by shopping carts, is two-fold. One is to minimize the footprint of the vehicles when parked. The other is that, when the vehicles need to be redistributed, a single driver can tow as many units as needed.That linking ability, at least for purposes of redistribution, would swiftly become obsolete if autonomous driving becomes the norm. However, it is interesting to think of how it could have power-sharing or perhaps even safety implications.MMS is currently seeking funding.",

    "description": "Upgrade your plain Christmas wreaths with these easy and inexpensive DIYs! Wreaths are one my favorite ways to decorate for the holiday season. There are so many easy ways to add festive touches to inexpensive, plain wreaths.  I put wreaths of every size all over our house when I decorate for Christmas. I realized this year that it takes me forever to put all of our holiday decor out because I can't leave well enough alone...I LOVE to tweak things and add my own touch. I've done that with wreaths a lot over the years, and even more so this year. I've gathered a bunch of DIYs for basic wreaths to give you some inspiration for this season!

I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.     I think evergreen wreaths are quite beautiful on their own, especially with some twinkling lights. I wanted this simpler look for the bookcases in my office that's been undergoing a makeover.  I picked up a couple of these Norway spruce wreaths from At Home:  src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh_IjzAjSLtroC1bI_h0IccAs-9ShtgnUtOlSvwr4joScdWnKaH92CACARASQw4Qemgn8_HrkSSuJqACSNA5zIdwo1Fg17TwmQw_bf95sHTVsFxfwMorH-jEzo_AQgThB_qD4_Y9jaU-83grsKGlV54mHUvOn4CMh8zJntdIPCUPGLhOp1VGRyxacOb1KI/s16000/Norway%20spruce%20wreath%20At%20Home.jpg\"\u003e They come in a two and three foot width, mine are the smaller versions.  I grabbed some of my pinecone stems that I use every year (from Hobby Lobby) and secured them together with some green floral wire: src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjvq6HwgZEOG5D_sslqiBPv0MY4QUXk_rDMyI1u6aMkVGzB11SPSxJVsynDE0QTOB96tVOmYLv9tdkN0yk6pr9XsDNfWKZWFjjTAi-iKfVb99mkYzfSuExdg6SR6AJ-E5S_cHwIJ2HIi3zCU0pGD2skEg48KKB1mtSO99Z5_yO7TVcOhzTbdZ3EW05uPN4/s16000/green%20floral%20wire%20for%20wreaths.jpg\"\u003e Then I used that same wire to attach the pinecones to the bottom of the metal base on the wreath. I added a bow with my camel colored velvet ribbon that I hung from the top:  src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg6ewIYP0rtoQBv5N82_WLVMWHZU-4prdbNVxJ7z0KencgqaPUE-4rmJ9_Cstz0xchS36CAMMRbmJfjOEmi5pEEwyKNSzqhjZ09NnmO_7ZMFcBqRnmPKNd8iFcAoekxFQZC-3vx4tdrhlrkapLBYvYCqhXRXsoMQvZ933kzJyFh52xjqYWPYecdnfhtgAk/s16000/DIY%20evergreen%20wreath%20with%20pinecones.jpg\"\u003e And then used three long pieces of the ribbon to hang from the bottom of the wreath as well: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Twenty beautiful Christmas mantel decorating ideas.I've gathered a bunch of absolutely gorgeous Christmas mantels to give you some inspiration this holiday season! If you have a fireplace, you know it's a focal point all year, but even more so during the holidays. If you decorate just that one spot it will make the room feel so festive!Even if you don't have a fireplace, a TV built in or console can be decorated similarly. If holiday decor intimidates you but you want to add some festive touches, I would suggest tackling the tree and a mantel and/or TV stand. My Christmas mantels have varied big time over the years -- from bright, traditional colors to more neutral moody vibes. I'll share a few of my favorites first, and then I have more beautiful examples from talented DIY and decor bloggers. At our last house, I finished up tiling our stacked stone basement fireplace right before the holidays. I loved how it looked with our flocked tree: The stone and long wood beam stole the show, so I didn't need to do much otherwise. Just some simple greenery along the top was perfect. The thorn in my side at that house was our corner fireplace in our family room. I thought it would be such a cool design feature, but I ended up hating it. 😂At first I added some box molding to the walls above it and tried to take advantage of all of that mantel space for my Christmas decor: We later built out that corner fireplace a bit and brought the wall forward. This changed the game! It was so much easier to work with, and looked like it fit so much better in the room. I was so excited to decorate the new fireplace for Christmas! The longer mantel was fun to decorate, and those hanging lanterns added some whimsy: I loved the traditional pops of red, but the next year was one of my all time favorites. I went super simple with inexpensive glass vessels wrapped with pretty scrapbook and wrapping paper:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it).

We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it. I won’t recap our entire decision to downsize (you can see the full explanation here) but the highlights are: We used to live in a 3,150 sq. ft. home in suburban Richmond, Virginia Now we live in a 1,400 sq.
