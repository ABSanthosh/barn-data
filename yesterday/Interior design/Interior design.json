    "description": "Where to find the best throw pillow covers for under $20!I'm back to share my favorite resources for cute and affordable pillow covers. I love sharing where I find home decor at a great price.  Pillow covers are one of those things I switch out more often than any other decor item. If you get them for a good price, they're an easy way to change up the accent colors in a room. I also like to use different textures and colors for the seasons.  I've found some sources for budget-friendly throw pillow covers (and inserts) over the years -- the prices are so good! ALL of the throw pillow covers I'm sharing have a zipper and are under $20, and most are well under that, or come in a set of two. This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. I prefer covers instead of store-bought pillows these because they cut down on the storage space significantly. I wash and store them away for different seasons and holidays and then reuse the removable inserts in the new cases. I find softer down-like inserts more comfy than the traditional pillow stuffing. I've been using these lightweight down alternative pillow inserts because you can get them in SO many sizes. The prices are hard to beat! When you order your inserts, order one size larger than your pillow cover for a fuller look!  1. Amazon pillow covers Amazon has a ton of throw pillow cover options under $20. I LOVE these neutral windowpane pillow covers on our bed: The quality is great -- I've washed them numerous times. They are SO pretty. There's a similar striped version I usually have on our dining room window seat as well: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Tips for purging and storing photos, artwork and paper mementos. Purging family keepsakes, photos and children's artwork can be SO overwhelming. As with any major decluttering project I take on, the process of sorting through and organizing these mementos took a lot of time!From start to finish, it took me NINE months to complete the process of going through all of our most treasured photos and paper memorabilia. I learned a lot through the process and wanted to share some tips with you. :) I decided I wanted to store everything all together when I was done. The bookcases I built in our basement have provided a ton of storage for us. I knew this was the perfect spot!: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. I still had plenty of room, so one of those cabinets is now a storage spot all of our family photos and stuff from our kids' childhoods. I had five main \"paper\" items to sort through and store: Small photos -- we had eight photos boxes FULL. Medium to large photos -- things like school and family photos. Some of my old family photos (some nearly 100 years old!!) are HUGE, and I wanted to find a way to enjoy them but keep them protected. Kids' schoolwork -- PILES of school projects ranging from tiny to huge. Mementos from our childhoods, travel and school like report cards, music programs and ticket stubs.Greeting cards -- more on that in a minute! My first step was to go through everything to decide what to keep. The key word there is KEEP -- one of my favorite parts about the Konmari decluttering method I've used for years is that it teaches you to hold on to items you cherish, instead of trying to decide what you want to give up. There is a difference, and I find keeping items I LOVE so much easier than deciding what needs to go. If I don't love something, I no longer feel guilty donating it. And if I LOVE it, I no longer feel guilty for keeping it, no matter how silly it may seem. It really is freeing to purge the clutter this way!Step one: The photosMy first part of this project was sorting through thousands of photos. It took me a loooong time to do this.Family photos and a small box of items are the only things from my childhood that my Mom was able save from move to move...so I cherish those photographs.Because of that, a few years ago I would have felt bad about tossing ANY photos. I've learned if I don't know the person in a picture and the people in my life who do (say, my Dad), don't want the photos...I can toss them. I can toss blurry photos I took from the bus windows on Girl Scout and school field trips. :) I can also throw away doubles from all of the rolls of film I took in middle and high school. (I did text some to friends to see if they wanted them.) It was SUCH a great feeling to toss a ton of the photos that were cluttering up the ones I wanted to enjoy. I whittled the photos down from eight boxes to five. I use these simple cardboard photo boxes and my last set held up for ten years!: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "The Krapp Strap, below, is an innovative design that makes it easier to poop outdoors. You just have to dig a hole in the right spot to bury your business afterwards. However, Industrial Design student Kunrui Peng points out that burying human feces is no longer harmless to the environment, now that we're all pumped full of meds. After doing research, Peng found:\"Human faeces contain increasingly complex substances such as chemicals, hormones brought on or triggered by pharmaceuticals, drug-resistant germs, etc. Laura C. Scott, a geneticist with the U.S. Geological Survey, collected soil and water samples from national parks in 2016, and the results were quite surprising. All samples showed the presence of drug-resistant bacteria. This phenomenon is directly linked to the increase in human activity.\"The authorities in more and more natural reserves are realizing this problem and offering tourists toilet bags. But simply squatting and trying to poop inside them is far from ideal.\"To that end, Peng designed this AirPot, a portable, inflatable toilet seat.\"The AirPot weighs only 0.6 kg and, when deflated, can be folded to the size of a water bottle.\" \"Wave it in the air for inflation, roll up the opening to seal it tight, and fold it.\" \"Put in the biodegradable toilet bag, which contains NASA-invented powder that solidifies human waste instantly and breaks down bacteria and odours.\" \"The toilet bag is held in place by four buttons.\" \"After finishing up, toilet bags need to be taken to human waste collecting facilities for disposal.\"Design Details\"The pot is made of PGA, a biodegradable, thermoplastic polymer and the liner, [biodegradable] aliphatic polyester.\" \"There's a 15-degree tilt on the pot as well as the inflatable toilet seat, making it easier to get up from.\" \"The upper part of the inflatable uses PU-coated polyester, a material commonly used for tents and outdoor covers. The bottom comprises PU-coated nylon, a durable textile that works well for hot air balloons.\"\"The materials used on the AirPot ensure it's airtight, watertight and skin-comfortable. Stains and dirt come off easily, too.\" Peng is pursuing his ID degree at Germany's Muthesius University of Fine Arts and Design. You can see more of his work here.",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/134160/Apples-New-Impossibly-Tiny-Mac-Mini-is-Now-Carbon-Neutral",
    "description": "This week Apple unveiled their new Mac mini, which they've somehow shrunk down to just 5\" square. The company says the tiny size was enabled both by the design of a power-efficient chip, and via \"innovative thermal architecture, which guides air to different levels of the system, while all venting is done through the foot.\"The company also says this is their first carbon neutral Mac:\"Mac mini is made with over 50 percent recycled content overall, including 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure, 100 percent recycled gold plating in all Apple-designed printed circuit boards, and 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. The electricity used to manufacture Mac mini is sourced from 100 percent renewable electricity. And, to address 100 percent of the electricity customers use to power Mac mini, Apple has invested in clean energy projects around the world. Apple has also prioritized lower-carbon modes of shipping, like ocean freight, to further reduce emissions from transportation. Together, these actions have reduced the carbon footprint of Mac mini by over 80 percent. For the small amount of remaining emissions, Apple applies high-quality carbon credits from nature-based projects, like those generated by its innovative Restore Fund.\"\"In another first for Mac mini, the packaging is now entirely fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal to remove plastic from its packaging by 2025.\" The $600 machines will hit store shelves next month.",
