    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/136686/From-Switzerland-a-Wheeled-Dog-Like-Robot-for-Carrying-Cargo",
    "description": "Swiss Mile was a spin-off from ETH Zurich's Robotic Systems Lab, and they developed an agile four-legged/wheeled robot we've been watching since 2021. Now Swiss Mile has morphed into RIVR, a properly commercial company that has adapted their robot design for cargo transport. Their LEVA 'bot is designed specifically to carry a standard Euro-type cargo box. While the wheels allow it to travel quickly on flat surfaces, it can also navigate stairs.Because its wheels can rotate in any direction, the LEVA can pick up or deposit the boxes sideways or front-ways.RIVR reckons their legs + wheels arrangement will give them a competitive advantage:\"Although the use of robotics is widespread in logistics, few solutions offer the capability to efficiently transport payloads both in controlled and unstructured environments. Four-legged robots are ideal for navigating any environment a human can, yet few have the features to autonomously move payloads.\"This is where LEVA shines. By combining both wheels (a means of locomotion ideally suited for fast and precise motion on flat surfaces) and legs (which are perfect for traversing any terrain that humans can), LEVA strikes a balance that makes it highly versatile. Furthermore, LEVA has an integrated ability to autonomously move payload containers.\"The thing I most like about the 'bot are its big, fat, easily-accessible, bright red \"off\" buttons.The company plans to formally unveil the LEVA prototype on May 28th.",

    "description": "These StakeLights are by Washington-based camping gear company UCO. They're tent pegs with a built-in LED light, meant to make it easier to set up a tent in the dark. They also make it easier to locate your tent at night, like when you're returning from a midnight call-of-nature answering.The LEDs can be removed from the stakes, if you need a portable light in a pinch. They're perhaps better suited to car campers, as opposed to those hiking in with everything on their backs; the stakes weigh 37 grams apiece (as opposed to the 10-15 grams your average tent peg weighs), and that's without the AAA battery each stake requires, another potential hassle. That said, they'll put out 17 lumens of light for up to 10 hours. They can also be set to strobe for up to 24 hours, if you're in an emergency situation. They're sold in 4-packs that run $25.",

We might worry too much about what other people will think (especially for those of us who post our homes on social media, since we have Instagram telling us what people like or don't like). We sometimes worry too much about the impact our changes will have on a future sale, even if we are making good decisions and have no plans to move any time soon.

But we soon realized how much we LOVE having a covered patio. When we moved in, we placed our outdoor table and chairs out there, but we learned pretty quickly that we prefer to lounge in comfy chairs. :)I sold our outdoor table and replaced it with our chairs that used to sit near our outdoor fireplace. This was how it looked soon after moving in:    It's around 200 square feet, which we've realized is a perfectly lovely size for conversations with a small group of friends.  You know how I love symmetry!

And before that we finally settled on the right seating that fit perfectly into the seating area. But yeah, since then... settled! So it felt like it was finally time to share how it all turned out.
