    "description": "Mercedes-Benz has unveiled their Vision V concept, a top-of-the-line minivan EV that targets the executive transport market. Envisioned as a \"private lounge\" on wheels, the cocoon-like interior is kitted out with Nappa leather seating, transparent storage compartments and no less than 42 Dolby Atmos surround-sound speakers. The glass partition between the passenger cabin and driver's compartment can be rendered opaque—or just partially transparent--at the touch of a button, as can the windows. There's also a gigantic 4K 65-inch screen that unfurls from the floor, allowing passengers to play games, watch movies, or view the vehicle's surroundings AR-style. The seats can recline into a flat position. Somewhat weirdly, there's an onboard chess set-up. The driver's compartment isn't too shabby either. The company says the production version will hew closely to the concept, and will roll out in 2026.",

    "description": "The original Mac's debut in 1984 launched the desktop publishing revolution. A parallel debut of equal importance was the launch of Emigre, a digital type foundry, the same year. Founded by designers Rudy VandeLans and Zuzana Licko, Emigre's influential typefaces--designed specifically for digital--were widely used in 1980s and '90s advertising, branding and publishing. The firm's popularity led to them publishing their own magazine, also called Emigre, which ran until 2005.Now the firm is releasing a book called Emigre Fonts: Type Specimens, 1985 – 2024, an update to a now-sold-out archive first released in 2016. The new version is a comprehensive 1,264-page tome that nearly doubles the length of the original. \"Founded in 1984 by Rudy VanderLans and Zuzana Licko, Emigre was one of the first independent publishers and type foundries to explore the new design possibilities offered by the Macintosh computer. Many people first encountered the foundry's typefaces in the innovative pages of Emigre magazine (1984–2005). But Emigre also issued small booklets to promote the virtues of their fonts and reveal the processes used to design them. More than simple sales tools, these collectible type specimens were enjoyed as much for their inventive contents as for their leading-edge typeface designs.\" \"Emigre Fonts: Type Specimens, 1986–2024, reproduces forty of these booklets in a single massive reference. With a preface from Letterform Archive associate curator Stephen Coles, a foreword from type design collaborator Jeffery Keedy, and a section of never-before-published behind-the-scenes content, this volume provides a near-definitive anthology of the foundry's remarkable story in print.\" Published by Letterform Archive, the book runs $75.",

This is the spot we spend most of our evenings when the weather starts to warm up!We had a large outdoor area at our last house, and added to it over the years to make it a beautiful oasis: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. If you'd like to see everything we did in the old backyard, be sure to check out these posts!  Our backyard was just so pretty and magical, and we definitely missed it after moving. But we soon realized how much we LOVE having a covered patio. When we moved in, we placed our outdoor table and chairs out there, but we learned pretty quickly that we prefer to lounge in comfy chairs. :)I sold our outdoor table and replaced it with our chairs that used to sit near our outdoor fireplace. This was how it looked soon after moving in:    It's around 200 square feet, which we've realized is a perfectly lovely size for conversations with a small group of friends.  You know how I love symmetry! It won out here too, does that surprise you? :)  A couple of years ago I moved seat configuration around a bit to give us a little more walking room along the side. Instead of two chairs on each end, I placed two under the large picture window to open things up a bit: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
