    "description": "Our favorite handy finds for around the house, all $10 or under!It's that time of year! This time the Amazon Prime sale goes for four days -- running from the 8th through the 11th of this week. I know there are a bunch of great deals on more expensive finds, but I prefer to share affordable items we actually use and love. Last year I shared my top favorites under $30, and the year before some of my best finds under $25. This year I went even lower and put a list together of handy home items, all for $10 and under! I wasn't meaning to gather things that I find particularly helpful, but it turned out that way. :) We use every item on this list of useful products, and all are super affordable, even without prime day discounts.This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    I know, I know...Christmas is a long way off! But I use these discounts to shop early and I'm always so thankful I did! It's so nice to have items crossed off your list before you even start. This new Amazon prime membership for ages 18-24 would make a great graduation or start of college gift! It's half the cost of regular memberships. Now the fun stuff! First up, these handy touch up paint pens! These are fantastic and make it so easy to touch up scuff marks and small drywall fixes:They come with four in the set and are easy to fill up. You push the button at the bottom of the pen to push the paint up into the brush. So handy! I keep them in our junk drawer for easy access. I got this one for myself last Christmas -- this puzzle \"scoop\" is also a magnifier and has a handy click on light: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Replacing our farmhouse style decor and furniture without spending a ton of money!It's inevitable that your design preferences will change over time, and it can get really expensive to replace furniture and decor with new items.I've been experiencing that over the past few years...craving more traditional touches over some of the farmhouse design pieces I've added to our home in the past. I actually quite like many of the design aspects of farmhouse decor -- wood ceiling beams, open shelves and yes, even shiplap walls! (Fitting that we just talked about that one.)But overall I've been making an effort to transition some of our farmhouseish items to more traditional decor that will stand the test of time. I've tweaked most of these for very little money -- with equal parts patience/online stalking and DIY projects. I don't think I've ever been happier with our home! Large living room chandelier.When we built our house eight years ago, the huge \"wagon wheel\" chandeliers were all the rage.I actually did like them (and still do) -- if you have a really tall ceiling or need a large fixture, these fill up the visual space nicely without becoming overwhelming: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    Plus they put off great light! Our large round chandelier is three to four feet wide and has 12 light bulbs. (A dimmer switch is a must for this kind of light!)As much as I like the light, I see it everywhere, most often in farmhouse style decor. But I definitely didn't want to spend the money to replace it. SO, I found a simple solution that (we think) gave the light a more transitional style. I found these small black lamp shades that fit onto candelabra bulbs:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "\"Train cars typically have a lifespan of approximately 30-50 years,\" explains Repurposed Materials, a company dedicated to salvaging still-useful castoff materials. \"After this period, they cease to comply with federal regulations and are subsequently taken out of service, undergoing decommissioning, parting out, and ultimately scrapping.\" The company collects the galvanized steel panels—often graffitied—that these decommissioned railcars are clad in. The 12-gauge material is still super-sturdy, and customers have used them to create fencing, planters, protective enclosures and cladding for platforms. The panels are 8' x 3' and weigh 71 pounds each. They're located in Iowa and run $99 a pop. They're willing to ship them if you can't pick up, but you've got to contact them for a quote.",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/137707/Highly-Successful-Public-Transportation-Mexico-Citys-Mexicable-System",
    "description": "From 1960 to the 2010s, the population of Mexico City's Ecatepec de Morelos neighborhood grew from a mere 4,600 residents to a staggering 1.6 million. Formerly farmland, this outlying area was remote, hilly and undesirable; its residents lived there because it was all they could afford. Public transportation was terrible, consisting of spotty bus service that took up to 85 minutes—each way—for residents to reach the city center. It was also dangerous, with bus passengers regularly robbed at gunpoint.The Mexican government decided to do something about it in the mid-2010s. A subway line was out of the question; the hillside terrain would make the cost unfathomable. Instead they struck upon the brilliant and economic solution of installing cable cars. The support poles minimize the footprint of the system and can be erected far faster than excavating for subway lines. Cable car stations are also much more compact than subway stations—there are no long platforms required—and building the cable car system cost 80-90% less than a metro line.Image: Tbhotch - CC BY-SA 2.5 mx The Mexicable system opened in 2016. Nearly 30,000 riders per day began using the system, which cost just 7 pesos (USD $0.36) to ride; in contrast, the buses cost 12-15 pesos. The commuting time was cut to as little as 17 minutes. Unlike buses, the electric-powered Mexicable emits no fumes. And perhaps most importantly, the system and its well-lit stations are CCTV-monitored and thus far safer than riding the bus.Image: Tbhotch - CC BY-SA 2.5 mx Image: Presidencia de la República Mexicana - CC BY 2.0 Both the government and the private sector subsequently began improving public spaces along the cable car's route, paving roads to provide better access to the stations and improving streetlighting. Local artists were commissioned to beautify the spaces with murals.Image: Presidencia de la República Mexicana - CC BY 2.0 Image: Tbhotch - CC BY-SA 2.5 mx Image: Presidencia de la República Mexicana - CC BY 2.0 The system was a rousing success, and a second line was added in 2023, connecting the northwest Tlalnepantla neighborhood. (Ecatepec is northeast.) A third line is currently under construction and will eventually link the further-flung neighborhood of Naucalpan.The video below provides a good look at the system and discusses the impact it's had on the community:",
