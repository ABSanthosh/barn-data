    "description": "Summer's almost here. Bote, a company that makes \"water lifestyle products,\" has a line of floating furniture for when you want to hang out in the drink. Each feature their \"Magnepod\" system, whereby you can magnetically attach the company's drinkware to the furniture. And because they're all inflatable, they break down for storage, making them easy to toss into car trunks and backpacks. Their Sling Chair seats one: Their Hangout Couch can seat three, and can be attached to create a floating conversation dock: And their circular Hammock series can seat a variable number. They come in 7', 10' and 15' diameters: Sure you can use these in a pool, but these look more at home in a proper body of water. Meaning yeah, you'll need that boat. The real move is to simply know someone who owns one. I hear the best two days of owning a boat, are the day you buy it, and the day you sell it.",

    "description": "Take a look at your favorite bag. How many different materials is it made out of? The backpack and musette bag in Freitag's Mono[PA6] series contain 17 different components: Buckles, straps, zippers, sewing thread, fabric, lanyards, etc. Amazingly, all 17 components are made of the exact same material: PA6, a variant of nylon. This is significant because it means the entire bag can be recycled, without having to dismantle the bag piece by piece. Freitag will take the bags back when you're done with them and recycle them in their entirety. And being Freitag products, the bags are both tough and water-repellent.The PA6 material isn't off-the-shelf nylon; engineering was required. \"The search for a single-material fabric that could repel water proved fruitless,\" the company writes. \"Most fabrics like that use coatings or membranes made of other materials. And because we were looking for a mono-material, that was out of the question. So, with a partner, we developed a brand-new fabric that's both water-repellent and a mono-material.\"The backpack runs $380 and the musette $101.",

    "description": "How to stain a fiberglass entry door in a rich wood color.  One of the most common questions I get is about the stain we used on our wood front door. Turns out our door isn't wood, but it is stained to look like it.  Did you know you can stain a fiberglass door and it will look just like wood? I didn't realize this until we built our current house. I had no idea you could use stain on anything but wood, and I've been at this DIY thing for a long time! We have a Therma Tru door set with sidelites (see specifics of our indoor and outdoor home finishes here) and picked the stain color called English Walnut.  Our front door doesn't get much of the elements because it's protected on our front porch. But even without the wind and rain hitting it directly, the dark stain was still super faded nearly eight years later.  I'm prepping for our son's high school graduation party, and this DIY project was on my list! The process wasn't nearly as difficult as I thought it would be. There are only a few simple steps in this application, they just take some time. The before photos of the door finish didn't look as horrible as in real life, but it was faded, worn out and chipping in some spots: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.
