    "description": "Canadian inventor Mitch Krahn suffers from a herniated disc. He finds that leaning far back in his chair helps to alleviate the pain, but finds it difficult to work from that position. He thus conceived of this Ergo Desk, a sitting and standing desk that can also recline, in the manner of a drafting table. It occurs to me that such a desk might appeal to the ID'er who sketches often. Nothing beats the ergonomics of drawing on an inclined surface, which provides full freedom of shoulder motion; I always found that having to rest your elbow on a flat surface really restricts your movements, forcing you to overcompensate with your wrists.I'm curious to see what the actual tilt mechanism is, assuming Krahn's got it worked out; he doesn't show it. And I think he might want to add a second stay-flat portion of the desk on the left side, to accommodate lefties who don't want their mouse/mousepad/coffee cup clattering to the floor. It would also help for those of us who have desktop speakers flanking our monitors. Krahn's plan is to launch the desk on Kickstarter next month.",

    "description": "I am all for floor-cleaning robots ; they can't do you much harm from down there. But Australian manufacturer Roborock decided to give their Saros Z70 robo-cleaner a freaking five-axis arm and a claw.The idea is that when it encounters an obstacle blocking its path, it lifts it out of the way to continue cleaning.It can also pick up things like your snotty tissues and throw them into a wastebasket (provided you program in the location of the wastebasket). It can perform these feats thanks to its dual-camera system—one on the chassis, one on the claw arm—which I'm sure the company doesn't use to spy on you. If you want to prevent the machine from pursuing you, you must erect a barrier larger than a threshold. The company says they've pre-programmed the units to recognize 108 objects, though they haven't disclosed what those objects are. (Sure, I'm paranoid for thinking that if this finds your passport or a credit card on the ground, it picks it up and photographs it.) You can program in a further 50 objects, because that is definitely what you should spend your free time doing.The units will roll out later this year. No price has been announced.",

Linen closet redo Since it's the season of decluttering and organizing, let's start with the closet that was a huge pain in my butt for years: I finally got down to business and removed the shallow wire shelving and replaced them with deeper wood shelves: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    SO much better!

    "description": "Christmas decor storage ideas and hacks that will make next year's decorating easier!I've figured out some great holiday storage solutions over the years that have helped to keep our Christmas decor better organized. These methods have made pulling out decor for the next Christmas much more efficient. These little tips save my sanity each November when the holiday decor comes out and when I put them away for the year. In general I find packing holiday decor away is faster and easier than setting it up! Am I the only one? I quite like the process, it feels cathartic to clean up the house and simplify everything for the new year. Here are my Christmas decor organization methods and a few tips I've figured out along the way!  1. Label your decor for next year My first tip is to label as much as you can -- especially the stuff you put up in the same spot every year. I've found over the years that labeling light strands I use for specific areas helps a TON!:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.  You can find my awesome label maker here! This smaller version works great too -- it's just a little more basic. Both are super easy to use.  I label any spot that uses more than one strand of lights -- both inside and outside. So when I get them out I know exactly how many bushes or trees are covered by that group of lights. I also label them inside, like the strands on our stair garland. That way I'm not trying to figure out how many I used the year before.  I use a LOT of these remote plugs and switches for our indoor lights. (That one is my favorite because I can use one remote for five items.) I store them away with the items that need a remote, like for the garland on our stairs. I just keep them plugged into the light strand.  I also keep any needed extension cords attached and stored away with the lights. If you have more than one set of these remotes, you know the joy of trying to figure out which one goes with which remote. ;) I label the matching sets so we know what goes with what: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

So let’s dive right into the 3 categories that we cover each year: Gift Ideas for Grown-Ups Gift Ideas for Kids Gift Ideas Under $12.99 Every year that we make these, we love including actual things that we own and enjoy, as well as things that we’re buying for others (like our own kids, each other, and relatives/friends). Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it). Quick note: The “Under $12.99” list isn’t the only one with items priced that low – for example, there are also two gifts under $12.99 on the kids list.

    "description": "In November of 2020, we published a post called “What’s It Like To Downsize” after living in our smaller home for 6 months. We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it. I won’t recap our entire decision to downsize (you can see the full explanation here) but the highlights are: We used to live in a 3,150 sq. ft. home in suburban Richmond, Virginia Now we live in a 1,400 sq.
