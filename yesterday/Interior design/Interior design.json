And before that we finally settled on the right seating that fit perfectly into the seating area. But yeah, since then... settled! So it felt like it was finally time to share how it all turned out.

I've kept a list of a few of these \"trendy fads\" that I think can and should be permanent fixtures in our homes. Some are older, some new...but I think all of the below are timeless looks and I'll explain why!And by the way, as I always say -- if you like it, do what you want! It's your house and you should enjoy it. Don't listen to me or anyone else when deciding what you truly love in your home!Dark hardwood floorsI couldn't believe my ears when I first started hearing mumblings of dark hardwood flooring becoming outdated. Flooring has definitely trended to lighter wood tones over the recent years, but I adore a classic darker wood stain. In our last home we were able to do traditional finished onsite hardwood floors throughout. It was only because of a leak in our kitchen and the subsequent insurance payout that we were able to do it, because they are definitely a splurge! We loved them so much, we ended up adding them to more rooms through the years: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

Those cloches are from IKEA and I just took a few fern sprigs off of a bundle I have. I love the look of them under the glass! (Find similar cloches with wood bases here.) Sometimes little faux plants can look a little wimpy on their own, and adding the glass makes them feel a bit more substantial, but not busy.  I had a big fake succulent I loved for my green office bookcases, but it needed a little something.
