    "description": "The Community First! Village in central Texas provides affordable housing to Austin's homeless population. Developed by Mobile Loaves \u0026 Fishes, an Austin-based nonprofit, it currently houses 370 formerly homeless people in tiny-house-style accommodations. Now they're getting an assist from Icon, a construction company that 3D prints houses. With backing from the Lennar Foundation (the charitable arm of Lennar, a production homebuilder), Icon will print 100 houses in an expanded portion of the village. These will be a mix of homes and townhouses ranging from 380 to 1,040 square feet. Icon says construction is currently underway. The news is fairly recent, and Icon doesn't yet have any video on their socials about it. However, if you're curious to hear what it's like to live in one of their 3D-printed houses, here are some testimonials from residents at their Wolf Ranch community in Texas:",

    "description": "The Core77 Design Awards Emerging Technologies category features systems, services, hardware, or software products created with the aid of recently created or developed software and hardware technologies. Examples include projects that incorporate the use of artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), blockchain technologies, robotics, biometrics, advanced materials, or new production processes.Hussain Almossawi has spent his career testing the boundaries of possibility. As the Design Director of Mossawi Studios (which he founded in 2019), Hussain devotes himself to exploring \"the limitless potential of design to create impactful change, driven by our imagination and insights.\" Prior to founding his multi-disciplinary design studio, the industrial designer, visual effects artist, and bestselling author built a portfolio of clients ranging from Nike, Apple, and Adidas to Intel and Ford Motor Company. He enjoys \"blurring the lines between product design and CGI\" and designing futuristic experiences, and this creative, forward-thinking mindset has made Hussain a sought-after keynote speaker and teacher on innovation and design. Hussain describes design as the place \"where the worlds of imagination and science converge, enabling us to transform creative visions into practical solutions.\" He finds discovery and growth in all aspects of the design journey, from exploring ideas to prototyping and refining solutions. Throughout, Hussain balances the desire to \"dream big\" with the practical need to solve \"real-world\" problems. As he describes it: \"Each step, from the initial concept to the final design, reflects the balance of creativity and logic. It's fulfilling to see how thoughtful design can shape meaningful outcomes and push the boundaries of what's possible.\"If Hussain holds any concerns about the state of the design industry, they center on designers' tendency to \"play it safe.\" This tentative approach, in his opinion, leads to \"the oversaturation and repetitiveness of identical ideas, where there's a reluctance to push boundaries or rethink what already exists.\" Hussain believes that a designer who hesitates to move beyond the status quo limits their opportunities for creativity and \"meaningful progress.\" As he explains, \"True innovation requires a willingness to improve, adapt, and take even small steps toward reimagining what's possible, yet too often, opportunities to elevate designs are overlooked in favor of familiarity.\"Hussain's advice to Core77 Design Awards entrants? \"Embrace failure as an essential part of the journey and focus on enjoying the process.\" In his experience, approaching setbacks as valuable learning opportunities can ultimately lead to breakthroughs. He also encourages designers to keep the experience fun and engaging. \"[That] will breathe life into your project, fueling your creativity and keeping you fully invested. When you approach challenges with enthusiasm and a willingness to grow, your passion and dedication will shine through in the final outcome, making your project stand out.\"2024 Core77 Design Awards Emerging Technologies winner Elroy Air for the Elroy Air Chaparral.The 2024 winner in the Core77 Design Awards Emerging Technologies category was Elroy Air for the Elroy Air Chaparral, an autonomous vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft capable of delivering 300 pounds of cargo across a 300-mile range. The Chaparral's ability to retrieve a full cargo container from a loading dock and fly it directly to a destination without transferring between trucks, trams, or airplanes can improve shipping logistics by increasing tempo and reducing cost and human risk.If you have an emerging technologies design that pushes the boundaries of possibility, submit it to this year's Core77 Design Awards.

It never fails that I'll get messages or emails about plant care when I share a room that has one in it. Today I'm sharing the biggest mistake I find so many are making when it comes to their house plants. I love having plants around the house -- they truly add \"life\" to our rooms and are the perfect way to fill awkward spaces.  Over the years of honing my plant growing craft, I've figured out the one big thing that keeps our fiddles leaf trees and other house plants thriving:  And it's probably not what you think!  Sunlight is important of course...that varies quite a bit depending on the type of plant.  Fiddles love sunlight! I've found over the years that they don't love direct light, ours (actually all of our plants) tend to do better with indirect light: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    I find fertilizing isn't necessary in most instances -- I don't do it a lot. Maybe once a year? In general ours do better in the summer months and go dormant in the cloudy, winter months with shorter days. I also don't add anything special to the soil to help it drain -- half the time I leave the plant in the pot it came in for a year or so!:That plant behind the sofa is fake!

Linen closet redo Since it's the season of decluttering and organizing, let's start with the closet that was a huge pain in my butt for years: I finally got down to business and removed the shallow wire shelving and replaced them with deeper wood shelves: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    SO much better!

Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it). Quick note: The “Under $12.99” list isn’t the only one with items priced that low – for example, there are also two gifts under $12.99 on the kids list.

We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it. I won’t recap our entire decision to downsize (you can see the full explanation here) but the highlights are: We used to live in a 3,150 sq. ft. home in suburban Richmond, Virginia Now we live in a 1,400 sq.
