    "description": "Here's a nuts-and-bolts ID case study from The Metcalfe Group. The Ohio-based consultancy was called on by a consumer products company after the first ID firm they hired didn't meet muster.Ironing Out the KinksA market-leading plastic manufacturer was looking to expand their offering of self-branded products. After a false start with another industrial design firm, they approached us to design a new iron organizer for consumer and commercial markets. They asked for a creative product design that would stand out in its field and offer new value, and we delivered. After assessing the current market of iron organizers, we began the industrial design phase by exploring a variety of functional and aesthetic concepts, all represented by 2D sketches and physical models to ensure legitimacy. Exploration with rough, functional prototypes allowed us to devise novel ways of retaining a clothes iron, giving us insights that would have been unlikely to surface from merely sitting at a desk. Even in the conceptual stage, physical mockups were created to validate each idea presented. Once a concept was chosen, a fixture was created to determine the ideal angles, dimensions and other geometry to refine its mechanics and ensure safety. We also created a test fixture which simulated real world scenarios and compared the new design to competitors. Through multiple iterations, we were able to create a design that matched or beat the competition in all tests, leading to a safer product. After aesthetic and feature refinements, we modeled the product in CAD, working with the client's manufacturing and engineering departments. This ensured that the final product design, despite challenging geometry, would be optimized for molding upon delivery to the client. After delivery, we remained available for production support. In addition, we provided illustrations and graphic design for the commercial box, and our high-fidelity prototypes were used for the product photography and pre-selling. In the end, The Metcalfe Group was able to fulfill the client's objectives for a stand-out product, not a \"me too\". This gave them a compelling safety story as well as a patent-pending design. Operationally, we remained within their cost target and produced a fresh new design that was well-received by their market channel and end customers. You can see more of The Metcalfe Group's work here.",

    "description": "Evening tour of our backyard patio and gardens!It's been a few years since I've done a backyard garden and patio tour! You can see how this space has changed by checking out this backyard tour from three years ago. This time I thought it would be cool to share this space in the evening, with the soft glow of our accent and landscape lighting. Over the past few years I've worked on a few DIY projects in the backyard that I'll share. This is our favorite place to be from the months of about April to October. At least when I'm not sweating bullets!I already shared a look at our covered patio a few months ago: That shaded spot is always lovely, especially with a light breeze going through. About a year after moving into our house, we had a long patio added off the covered porch. It's a great spot for our outdoor dining table and a couple of other sitting areas: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    Usually by now our container flowers are starting to get a little crispy, but I've been babying them all summer.

    "description": "How to easily treat wood butcher block counters so they will resist moisture and last forever!Contrary to popular belief, wood countertops are not hard to take care of! If you treat them correctly up front, they will last for decades (even around a sink). One of the top five questions I get about our house (and our old one!) is about our butcher block countertops. We've had wood counters on our islands for around 15 years now. Thanks to my Dad I know the best way to treat them and keep them beautiful for years! I shared how to protect bare wood counters a few years ago, so check out that post to see more detail. I also share how I stained the butcher block in that post. This time I wanted to show you how well they have held up over the past eight years and share how I retreat them every year or so: It's really best to reapply this every six months or so...but as you'll see, it's not absolutely necessary. Ours have held up beautifully even after a year or more.  Overall, the whole island counter has lightened from use, and it was uniform. The only part that was slightly darker was under the tray that I use for hand and dish soap: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   Nearly EVERYTHING is easily cleaned off of the wood counters. We've had water condensation sit for hours, water spills, wine, cat vomit 😖 -- all of it. If you treat them well like I'll show you, you won't have any issues keeping them clean.  The only thing that I haven't been able to remove is permanent marker:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "One of my favorite things to do in every season is just putter around the house. In the winter, it’s an indoor rhythm—quiet and cozy. I’ll make a hot drink, light a candle, tidy up a corner or maybe move a few things around just to make the space feel a bit more inviting. It’s not about tackling a big project—it’s about being present and making the home feel better in small ways. In the summer, I’m still holding a warm mug (anyone else a hot coffee year-round person?), but the experience feels a little different. The doors are always open so a fresh coastal breeze comes through. I might step outside on a whim to clip herbs or snip some flowers, and come back in the kitchen to put them in a vase. While I'm there I might clear the counters or rearrange a shelf, but only if I'm inspired to. Most of the time I'm just puttering around the house, doing any small thing that makes me happy but also doing nothing in particular.",
