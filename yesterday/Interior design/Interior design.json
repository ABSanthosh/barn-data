    "description": "Here's an example of how a savvy, experienced industrial design consultancy can help established companies find success in new market segments. When Bernzomatic sought to expand from the construction sector into the consumer market, they tapped ID firm Thrive.EMPOWERING PROPANE EXPERTS TO MEET NEW CONSUMER MARKETSLeveraging Bernzomatic's professional-grade propane know-how in an untapped consumer market required the brand to rethink how it kindled new fans.We engineered the world's first no-assembly-required patio heating system. Bringing the Heat to Untapped MarketsBefore Thrive stepped in, Bernzomatic was known only for its propane expertise in the construction industry, having no share in the \"outdoor living\" consumer market. We changed this by creating a product that homeowners felt safe assembling on their own and were happy to use on chilly evenings.Designing from the Ground UpPropane cylinders were unfamiliar (and a little scary) to the home market. To solve this, we re-thought the entire category, working from the ground up to engineer new propane and gas flow regulators, a new propane nozzle, burner assembly and jets, and a unique heat distribution system. We then packed it all inside a never-before-seen \"nested\" design that made it easier to ship.Collapsible Heater Requires No Assembly Getting Technical While Addressing the EmotionalDespite the prevalence of gas-powered grills in backyards, our research revealed that the typical homeowner was pretty frightened of gas appliances and lacked confidence when it came to assembling them. So, we started from scratch here too, designing a sleek heater that required zero assembly. Buyers simply unboxed the unit, pulled up on the top, and then locked everything into place with a twist—one step, no tools, no worries.Twist and extendGas rail \u0026 burner assemblyHeat deflector assembliesRaising the Bar for CompetitorsThough Bernzomatic was new to the consumer market, it entered with a serious spark thanks to our expertise in fluid dynamics, structural engineering, material science and manufacturing, as well as our emphasis on consumer-optimized safety, heat output and shipping costs. In short, by rethinking every aspect of what made an ideal patio heater, we made sure that our product stood out, and competitors could not rely on quick fixes to match it.You can see more of Thrive's work here.",

    "description": "Our favorite pet stain remover spray that gets everything out with NO scrubbing!  I'm sharing a quick post about a pet stain remover we've used for years and LOVE. We can't live without this stuff now! This isn't a sponsored post, I just like to share things that work. If you have animals I think you'll find it worthwhile.Just a warning...these are the worst pictures you'll ever see on the blog. 😂 I can't get around not showing you so you can see how it works, so bear with me.   Our little chihuahua dog absolutely HATES going out when it's really cold out. He's fine most days, but when it's bone-chilling cold he will go in and out as fast as possible. I can't blame him!  This time of year we will occasionally find a little pee spot:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. About eight years ago I found a non-toxic pet stain spray called Furry Freshness on a Facebook ad of all places. I decided to try it out based on the raving reviews. It really is a miracle solution. I've never used anything like it! You just spray the spot enough so that it's saturated: And by the next day the stain will be gone (well, usually). Sometimes we have to spray again, but it's just the same process of saturating the stain. We've used this so many times in our house and I can't even find the spots where we sprayed.  Let it sit for the best results -- don't scrub it into the carpet, don't do anything! This was just a few hours later:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Step-by-step tutorial to recover a seat cushion with new fabric. You can give almost any upholstered dining or accent chair a brand-new look with minimal time and effort!  I've recovered quite a few chairs over the years, and some were easier than others. One of my most difficult DIY projects ever was recovering our upholstered dining room chairs years ago.  All six had fabric on the seat as well as the back, and removing all of it was one of the most tedious and annoying projects I've ever taken on. ;) I would rather not do that ever again.  But the process of cover the chairs with new fabric wasn't that bad at all! The easiest process when you have a chair with an upholstered seat cushion that is removable.  My latest project was in my office. I've had this more modern chair in there for years (this is the best pic of it with the new wallpaper and paint):  But the more I transformed this room, the more it felt of out of place. I wanted something a little cozier, a little warmer that fit in better.  I found the perfect chair on Facebook Marketplace. I loved the warm, dark wood tone and the caning on the back: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

Keen to avoid a cliched ‘moving to the country typical look’ they engaged Arent\u0026Pyke to redesign the interior in their signature colourful and glamorous, yet classic and comfortable, style. Within five months of the initial concept meeting, the interior was transformed. It’s now a sophisticated and stylish home suitable for relaxed entertaining, elevated by Italian designer furniture and interesting fabric selections.",
