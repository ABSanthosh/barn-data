    "description": "To correct a skeletal disorder in teenagers, medical device manufacturer R\u0026D Surgical Ltd asked industrial design firm PDR to design this special brace. Two, actually: One for males and one for females.Male BraceA next-generation brace for the treatment of Pectus Carinatum (often known as pigeon chest) where the breastbone protrudes excessively affecting approximately 1 in 400 children. Treatment involves compression over time to allow correct bone development. Existing braces are unchanged from the early 20th century. These are uncomfortable, activity limiting, difficult to wear, and difficult to disguise, thus increasing feelings of isolation and stigmatisation for patients who are typically teenage boys.A NEW BRACEThe new brace is designed to fit neatly and discreetly beneath clothes using contemporary materials and easy-to-use mechanisms to create a more comfortable, clinically effective solution.A SOFT TOUCHThe brace is slimline in nature using a combination of materials including elastomers and technical fabrics to aid comfort and fit. The unit is fully adjustable to produce a tailored and asymmetric fit as necessary to allow for comfortable all-day wear without chafing, excessive discomfort and bulkiness under clothing. OPTIONSAvailable in three sizes with multiple adjustments allow the user to easily adjust the device to their own requirements. Female BraceA pectus carinatum brace designed specifically for the teenage, female form with a neat, discreet and comfortable fit.Up to 4 million children each year are thought to be affected by pectus carinatum, also known as pigeon chest. While the condition mainly affects teenage boys, girls also suffer with the condition. Clamping the breastbones to allow them to grow correctly is an effective treatment but current frames are unchanged from 80-year-old designs, uncomfortable, debilitating and crucially not designed to fit a female form. The new brace is specifically designed for the teenage female form, to fit neatly and discreetly. Worn beneath clothes, it uses contemporary materials and mechanisms to create a more comfortable, clinically effective and discrete solution. This is the first innovation in the treatment of pectus carinatum for many years and there are no other competing products that take a similar approach. The organisation, established by a small group of practicing paediatric clinicians, believes strongly in a holistic approach to treatment that recognises emotional as well as physical wellbeing. The female brace product is their second product which places at its core a very human-centred approach and deep understanding of user needs.Structural design, alongside careful ergonomic study, run parallel with requirements around patient comfort and wellbeing, to ensure effective treatment. Chromed metal bars and clamps are replaced with a slimline metal and Delrin subframe, that provides the underlying structure through which compression forces are applied. This subframe is enclosed with padded and breathable fabric outer that provides a comfortable and approachable form, that can fit underneath clothes and allow for discreet, comfortable use with an aesthetic more acceptable and less stigmatising to teenage users.Clinical study to date has proved the device to be both effective and strongly liked by teenage girls who suffer with the condition. Treatment at this stage, while bones are still developing, cures the problem of protrusion which in turn prevents complications such as breathing difficulties and chest pain emerging. The greatest impact however is outside of the physical and relates to perceptions of body image and self-confidence, so critical in teenage years. Treatment can be up to 24 months and the device is designed to be returned, the fabric and padding, which are easily removed for cleaning, replaced, and reissue to a new patient. The product can be easily set up and adjusted by a clinician to the subject, and compression forces applied with the slimline ratchets on each side of the product. As a subject grows the product can be easily adjusted without tools to accommodate this. Trials indicate the more distributed force and greater comfort of the device ensures longer use and better outcomes in a shorter time. The comfort and ability to wear beneath clothes allows users to carry on with their daily lives with minimal disruption.You can see more of PDR's work here.",

    "description": "How to spray paint cabinet hardware and get a perfect finish! You can give your kitchen or bathroom cabinets a new look by spray painting your knobs and pulls instead of replacing them.I love any project involving one of my very favorite DIY \"tools\" ever -- spray paint!I've blabbed on and on about my love of spray paint for years now. It's one of the easiest and least expensive ways to completely transform an item or room.  This transformation was in the kitchen and I'm really happy with how it turned out. I've added an update on this hardware and how it held up at the end of this post! When I was picking out the finishes for this house, I went much \"softer\" and lighter than I had in the past.  It felt right at the time, as we were starting fresh. But I quickly discovered that I am a contrast lover through and through. Almost immediately I was craving it. I started painting walls super dark, hung dark wallpaper and changed out some lighting for bigger and bolder options.  This project involved our kitchen handles:  I picked a lovely brass handle that looks GREAT. I loved the handles and the color was gorgeous! But they didn't feel substantial enough -- it was something I noticed every time I walked into the kitchen. I bought a set of black handles just to see if I liked them:  We loved them! But it would have been kind of spendy to replace all of the hardware. And ours are really nice, I just wanted to change the color.  So...spray paint to the rescue!I've spray painted bathroom and kitchen handles in the past and it's a really easy DIY project. Spray paint is a GREAT way to ease into do-it-yourself projects. For this one I used the Krylon Fusion All-in-one spray paint to paint our hardware:      I wanted a slightly more modern feel so I went with the satin black. It leans towards a matte finish but is not dull at all.  The easiest way to spray paint cabinet hardware. Spraying hardware can be tricky because you need to get all the angles. Sometimes it's difficult to access it all. My friend Lindsay shared this brilliant tip for spraying pulls and knobs:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

Her kids are younger so I go crazy with Halloween decorating. Nothing too spooky, and nothing is perfectly styled just so. We did our movie night last week and I thought it would be fun to share how I decorate this space for the month of October. I finished building our kitchenette (from the ground up!) earlier this year, and it's been fun to add some seasonal items down there. Most items in this space are from HomeGoods over the years. The large ceramic ghost was a Michael's find earlier this year: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. He's paintable but I left him as is for now.

Even before Georgie Marks, owner and design principal of George Marks Design, bought the 1950s abode with her partner Ben Coombs, she knew it required a sensitive touch. In fact, the designer went as far as drawing up 3D plans of the potential renovation a mere four hours after viewing the property in January 2020. Fast forward four years and her original design has now taken shape. The home remains as it was — perched among the towering gum trees — but lovingly updated for modern living. Ready for their next project, Georgie and Ben have decided to put it on the market. Take a look below.",
