    "description": "If you own a 3D printer, you've got hard plastics covered. But what if you want to make something soft or squishy, like grip pads or a gadget enclosure? You might want to check out the Saltgator, a desktop SoftGel injection molding machine. This allows you to mold soft plastics (which you can buy from the company, also called Saltgator, or a hobby shop or fishing-lure supplier) and mold a piece up to 250mL (8.4 oz) in volume in about 15 minutes. And most of that time is simply waiting for the machine to heat up; the pieces cure in about 3 minutes.You can use existing resin molds or 3D print your own. While there's no fixed build area, the size limitations are both the aforementioned 250mL volume and an overall length no greater than 276mm (10.9\"). That's to do with the size of the built-in syringe that you use to fill the mold. The $230 machine has been successfully Kickstarted, with 42 days left to pledge at press time. They expect to ship in September.Here's how you use it:",

    "description": "During World War I, American soldier James H. Smith was stationed in France. While there, he observed a French farmer tending a fire with an unexpected implement: An old rifle barrel. The farmer blew through the barrel to stoke the fire, then used the barrel itself as a poker.After returning to the 'States, Smith began working on an invention inspired by the farmer's rifle barrel hack. It took a while, but in 1941 Smith patented the Blo-Poke. This was a brass tube with a mouthpiece on one end, and a sort of arrowhead on the other. The arrowhead was cast with a fluted groove, allowing air to travel through the tube.Today, nearly 85 years later, the Blo-Poke is still in production. They're made in Connecticut, are available in a variety of finishes, and run $185.",

    "description": "Evening tour of our backyard patio and gardens!It's been a few years since I've done a backyard garden and patio tour! You can see how this space has changed by checking out this backyard tour from three years ago. This time I thought it would be cool to share this space in the evening, with the soft glow of our accent and landscape lighting. Over the past few years I've worked on a few DIY projects in the backyard that I'll share. This is our favorite place to be from the months of about April to October. At least when I'm not sweating bullets!I already shared a look at our covered patio a few months ago: That shaded spot is always lovely, especially with a light breeze going through. About a year after moving into our house, we had a long patio added off the covered porch. It's a great spot for our outdoor dining table and a couple of other sitting areas: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    Usually by now our container flowers are starting to get a little crispy, but I've been babying them all summer.

    "description": "How to easily treat wood butcher block counters so they will resist moisture and last forever!Contrary to popular belief, wood countertops are not hard to take care of! If you treat them correctly up front, they will last for decades (even around a sink). One of the top five questions I get about our house (and our old one!) is about our butcher block countertops. We've had wood counters on our islands for around 15 years now. Thanks to my Dad I know the best way to treat them and keep them beautiful for years! I shared how to protect bare wood counters a few years ago, so check out that post to see more detail. I also share how I stained the butcher block in that post. This time I wanted to show you how well they have held up over the past eight years and share how I retreat them every year or so: It's really best to reapply this every six months or so...but as you'll see, it's not absolutely necessary. Ours have held up beautifully even after a year or more.  Overall, the whole island counter has lightened from use, and it was uniform. The only part that was slightly darker was under the tray that I use for hand and dish soap: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   Nearly EVERYTHING is easily cleaned off of the wood counters. We've had water condensation sit for hours, water spills, wine, cat vomit 😖 -- all of it. If you treat them well like I'll show you, you won't have any issues keeping them clean.  The only thing that I haven't been able to remove is permanent marker:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "One of my favorite things to do in every season is just putter around the house. In the winter, it’s an indoor rhythm—quiet and cozy. I’ll make a hot drink, light a candle, tidy up a corner or maybe move a few things around just to make the space feel a bit more inviting. It’s not about tackling a big project—it’s about being present and making the home feel better in small ways. In the summer, I’m still holding a warm mug (anyone else a hot coffee year-round person?), but the experience feels a little different. The doors are always open so a fresh coastal breeze comes through. I might step outside on a whim to clip herbs or snip some flowers, and come back in the kitchen to put them in a vase. While I'm there I might clear the counters or rearrange a shelf, but only if I'm inspired to. Most of the time I'm just puttering around the house, doing any small thing that makes me happy but also doing nothing in particular.",
