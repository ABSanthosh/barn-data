    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/134628/Ox-Delivers-Flatpack-EV-Truck-Creates-Prosperity-in-Africa",
    "description": "How do you create wealth? One answer is by enabling trade. British company Ox Delivers observed that the Global South is hamstrung in this regard; entrepreneurial individuals are hampered by unreliable transportation networks, and without an efficient way to ship goods, prosperity through trade is impossible.The company thus designed their eponymous vehicle, the Ox. This is a truck that they ship to Africa flatpacked, and assemble near their deployment areas to save on costs. The Ox is electric, has a range of 150 km (90 miles), and a payload capacity of 2,000 kg (4,400 lbs). The company reckons they are nearly ten times less expensive to operate than existing delivery methods. Rather than selling the trucks outright—which would be prohibitively expensive for their target market—Ox Delivers has rolled them out as trucks-as-a-service. Using an app, merchants book space on trucks to ship their goods at an affordable rate, the way you can split a shipping container. They can pay through the app and also, importantly, see where the trucks are with their goods, gaining an accurate sense of delivery times. The positive impact on those using Ox Delivers cannot be understated. Here are some customer stories, where they discuss the night-and-day difference of their before-Ox and after-Ox experiences:Ox Delivers launched in Rwanda in 2021 (initially with a diesel-powered version of the truck; they switched to an electric powertrain in 2022). Today they have over 5,000 customers in Rwanda, and this year signed a $163 million multi-year franchise agreement to expand into East Africa. Ox Delivers will soon be operating in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, and Burundi.",

Cat scratches on wood or marks from dog claws on the floors will vanish with this trick. :) Sometimes I hesitate to share these more basic \"DIYs\" or fixes, but then I do them in our home and am reminded that they are super helpful. So I'm sharing! :) This is a quick repair for anything wood in your home that has minor damage -- anywhere where the top finish or stain has nicked off. I miss the gorgeous floors in our old house so much!: They are white oak, finished on site hardwoods and are gorgeous. (The stain color is Jacobean by Minwax.)And they have held up beautifully. You pay for that quality -- they are labor intensive to install, but so worth it! Compared to our current engineered flooring, those were pristine (and we lived with those for way longer).We find a new scratch or nick in our engineered hardwoods often. It's not too bad...usually we don't even notice them until we're cleaning. It's when I'm vacuuming and trying to pick up what I think is dirt that I see them: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

I find it much easier to decorated smaller spots, especially for the holidays.  Usually I'm overwhelmed by all of the display space our long Everett entryway table has. Last year I just lined up our cute lighted village: And it was very pretty! But I wanted to do something a little more Christmasy this time.  This year I decided to place the DIY wood \"believe\" sign I made a few years ago on the bottom shelf.  Each letter is individual and I made them to stand up, so I spread them out along the bottom and then added some small decor accents like greenery and pinecones: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it).

We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it. I won’t recap our entire decision to downsize (you can see the full explanation here) but the highlights are: We used to live in a 3,150 sq. ft. home in suburban Richmond, Virginia Now we live in a 1,400 sq.
