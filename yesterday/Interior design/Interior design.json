    "description": "This OLO Table is by industrial designer Joe Doucet. The material, seen up close, is quite unusual: It's made out of 100% Polygood Oyster material, which manufacturer The Good Plastic Company creates from polystyrene harvested from discarded keyboards, computer mice and refrigerators. The material can be thermoformed, as seen with the table, and in turn is also recyclable. OLO's fluid geometry reflects the closed-loop design philosophy behind the collaboration. Designed to highlight Polygood®'s unique thermoformable qualities—a rarity among recycledsheet materials—the piece features sweeping semi-circular legs and a seamless, monolithic top. Executed with precision CNC joinery and a refined silhouette,OLO bridges sustainability and iconic form in a way that feels both timely and timeless. \"This project is about more than material reuse,\" says Joe Doucet. \"It's about proving that sustainability and high design are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they're essential to one another.\" The OLO Table is a one-off, with no production plans announced.",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/136776/The-Rivian-R1Ts-Brilliant-Seamless-Tailgate-Design-Feature",
    "description": "Pickup trucks are supremely useful for hauling stuff. But all pickups with conventional tailgates have the same UX hassle: Lowering the tailgate reveals a crevice between the tailgate and the bed. If you're unloading something heavy that has a flange on the bottom, like an air conditioner, it will catch in this crevice. If you're unloading something fine, like wood chips, mulch, gravel or dirt, scooping it out will fill this crevice, making it impossible to close. Worse, with modern trucks, when you clear this crevice out with a screwdriver, you have to take care not to mess up the wiring harness running through that gap.Rivian's R1T pickup truck is designed for the \"adventure\" market, not landscapers and contractors. But Rivian's designers have added a brilliant feature to the bed that the latter market would greatly appreciate. When you lower the R1T's tailgate, it pulls with it a sliding panel that covers the crevice. If you're wondering why there are so many panels, the large one in the center is actually a lid that reveals the spare tire. All of the panels in the bed are imbricated; that fancy word means they're laid in the manner of roofing tiles, overlapping in the same direction. So as you unload, nothing snags. I desperately wish my own truck had this feature. When loading it with fine stuff like wood chips, I always have to lay down a tarp first and bungie it into place to cover the crevice. It's extra work, extra stuff to carry and generally a pain in the neck.",

We might worry too much about what other people will think (especially for those of us who post our homes on social media, since we have Instagram telling us what people like or don't like). We sometimes worry too much about the impact our changes will have on a future sale, even if we are making good decisions and have no plans to move any time soon.

Over the years I've come up with quite a few ways to save on both annual and perennial plants this time of year. Sometimes I will still splurge on a plant or tree, but for the most part these methods will save me a TON on flowers, bushes and trees for our gardens and yard. I've planted or replanted a TON of plants this spring (most were small, individual flowers) and have loved watching them thrive. I gathered my top five ways to save on plants this spring and summer! 1. Pick spreading plantsI love our window boxes, but they can be expensive to fill every spring. I learned years ago that using flowers that spread will make my money go a lot further. My favorite has always been the Wave Petunias because they multiply like crazy and cascade out of boxes or containers: These are the only annual flowers I plant each year because they spread and fill in so beautifully. Annuals only last one season, perennials will come back year after year.For your landscaping, look for ground cover or flowers that spread, like this awesome sedum plant I showed you years ago:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
