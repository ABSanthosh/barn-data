Kate has lived here ever since, adding a new kitchen to the apartment to reflect her love of olive green and cooking in a clutter-free space.

This is one of my favorite posts all year. My decor preferences overall (from colors to textures) lean \"fall\" anyway, so this is the time of year I feel like our home really shines! I prefer warm, rich colors and incorporating brass and wood decor accents. This time of year, more is MORE in our home. :) We'll start the tour in the entryway, where I decorated our Everett table with faux stems in dusty pink and plum colors: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. On the other side, I filled this glass candle hurricane with little acorns and pine cones:I piled my wicker pumpkins on the lower shelf, along with dried hydrangeas in a faux leather basket: Everything goes so well with the lovely rug I added a few years ago.

    "description": "How to spray paint cabinet hardware and get a perfect finish! You can give your kitchen or bathroom cabinets a new look by spray painting your knobs and pulls instead of replacing them.I love any project involving one of my very favorite DIY \"tools\" ever -- spray paint!I've blabbed on and on about my love of spray paint for years now. It's one of the easiest and least expensive ways to completely transform an item or room.  This transformation was in the kitchen and I'm really happy with how it turned out. I've added an update on this hardware and how it held up at the end of this post! When I was picking out the finishes for this house, I went much \"softer\" and lighter than I had in the past.  It felt right at the time, as we were starting fresh. But I quickly discovered that I am a contrast lover through and through. Almost immediately I was craving it. I started painting walls super dark, hung dark wallpaper and changed out some lighting for bigger and bolder options.  This project involved our kitchen handles:  I picked a lovely brass handle that looks GREAT. I loved the handles and the color was gorgeous! But they didn't feel substantial enough -- it was something I noticed every time I walked into the kitchen. I bought a set of black handles just to see if I liked them:  We loved them! But it would have been kind of spendy to replace all of the hardware. And ours are really nice, I just wanted to change the color.  So...spray paint to the rescue!I've spray painted bathroom and kitchen handles in the past and it's a really easy DIY project. Spray paint is a GREAT way to ease into do-it-yourself projects. For this one I used the Krylon Fusion All-in-one spray paint to paint our hardware:      I wanted a slightly more modern feel so I went with the satin black. It leans towards a matte finish but is not dull at all.  The easiest way to spray paint cabinet hardware. Spraying hardware can be tricky because you need to get all the angles. Sometimes it's difficult to access it all. My friend Lindsay shared this brilliant tip for spraying pulls and knobs:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "We started using a homemade window cleaner last year and immediately regretted not switching sooner. Not only is it cheaper than storebought stuff like Windex, it also cleans better and without streaks! Plus, it only takes 2 ingredients (although more can be added). So grab an empty spray bottle and come see the light with us! That's supposed to be a clean window pun, btw... Continue reading The Easiest Homemade Window Cleaner at Young House Love.",

The rest of us colloquially refer to the fifth pocket in a pair of jeans as the coin pocket, and in an age of declining cash transactions, the pocket no longer has much of a use.Candy company Werther's Originals is running a promo where they're raffling off these pairs of jeans. From the front and back they look normal… …but they're stitched with no less than 30 coin pockets, running up and down the legs. The idea being that, in advance of Halloween, they're the perfect stash size for the company's candies. As silly as the idea is, I can't help but think someone with some specialty job could actually come up with a good use for these.",

    "description": "GE Appliances sells this Access Kit, which contains over 450 transparent stickers featuring Braille and raised symbols. The idea is to make it easier to retrofit existing appliances for households with blind or low-vision members. \"Designed to represent the 80 most common settings across thousands of appliances, the durable stickers are placed directly over existing controls, allowing appliance buttons, knobs and other functions to be identifiable by touch. They are created to be easy to feel and differentiate with a thin and angular tactile design. They are also transparent so the original text can still be viewed.\"GE uncovered the need for the kit while conducting customer research, which shows the importance of studying what end users actually need: \"Our research showed that a lot of blind and low-vision consumers are devising their own complex systems just to navigate the settings on their appliances, making simple household tasks incredibly difficult,\" said GE industrial designer Chris Bissig, who leads a team of both industrial and user interface designers in the Concept \u0026 Brand studio. GE produced the kit in partnership with the American Printing House for the Blind (APH). They retail for $20.",
