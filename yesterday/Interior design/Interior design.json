    "description": "For every schlocky consumerist invention spammed into our inboxes this year, we did see some true innovations. Objects and systems intended to improve society and businesses, created by clever designers, engineers and inventors. Here's what jumped out at us in 2024:Vertical farm pioneer Plenty says \"We can grow an entire soccer field worth of produce in the size of a goal.\" For pop-up event spaces and exhibitions, this Expandable Touchdown Trailer can move its own wheels out of the way, then lower itself to the ground. Pipe Lighting's inflatable, lightweight LED lights provide better UX for production crews. This CruiseUp, a new type of flying vehicle, uses innovative \"CycloRotors\" to move the vehicle in all directions. The Aerocart is a goose-inspired towed cargo glider that aims to slash shipping costs. This PlugVan system offers modular, hot-swappable van interiors for camping and work. Maxim de Jong, a pioneer of \"soft system space architecture,\" designed this revolutionary inflatable space station. It's a more economical way to get a space habitat into orbit.Design researcher Sasha McKinlay, of MIT's Self-Assembly Lab, has developed a revolutionary clothes production method using an industrial knitting machine and a heat-blasting robotic arm. UK company RapidRoot has developed a lightweight, concrete-free building foundation system that allows for building in remote locations. Japanese researchers have developed a flying fire hose that can reach through windows. In Washington State, a frustrated DOT official worked out a way to use drones to erase difficult-to-reach graffiti. Bounce Imaging created a throwable panoramic thermal camera and two-way speaker for the military and police. It provides better tactical awareness and aids with hostage negotiations. The Spacetop, now coming to market, is a no-screen laptop. AR glasses provide the screens. Swiss company Zippsafe has designed a space-saving locker room that utilizes textile lockers. This brilliant hardhat design blows an air curtain in front of your face, serving as a safe and less cumbersome alternative to wearing facemasks.These cleverly-designed anti-flooding barriers by AquaFence keep structures safe during hurricanes. The Spider X1S is a large-format laser cutter with a compact form factor.Airback's backpacks and luggage can shrink their contents with a vacuum, allowing you to carry 50% more stuff. Former architect Hoxxoh, now a mural artist, hacks sprinklers to spray paint.",

    "description": "Twelve moody holiday art prints that make inexpensive holiday decor. One of my favorite inexpensive ways to add some festive holiday touches around the house is with printable art. I replace random framed art here and there with pretty Christmas prints.  It's SO easy to either print these at home, or send off to a quick printing service like CVS or Walgreens. I usually use smaller sizes like 8x10 and below, but you can have larger sized printed and shipped to you in a few days.  I've shared a ton of FREE Christmas printables that you can download and print at home for next to nothing.  Today I've rounded up twelve moodier prints for the season that give such a cozy vibe, I love them all! All of these are under $5 (at the time of this post).  If you saw my Santa-themed foyer last week, you saw the beautiful Santa art I used there:  src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqgR6aOhYkqJOPvCvmzcJR1MoK05_T76bTBz_MrYPxN0i9l8mgExy6igBDumcIANvr4w3fS4LhU0XXxeW1c_HipeWpWT7MPZmw6tSsv4JA9v8pXxt1Wcqmgze_xab3reXyNs33P-R6afoVr-xjOZvplkRH3BpW0WmDD5ygCmsp5HoS9pEnjV1c_4nAnZQ/s16000/Santa%20themed%20display.jpg\"\u003e This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

Cat scratches on wood or marks from dog claws on the floors will vanish with this trick. :) Sometimes I hesitate to share these more basic \"DIYs\" or fixes, but then I do them in our home and am reminded that they are super helpful. So I'm sharing! :) This is a quick repair for anything wood in your home that has minor damage -- anywhere where the top finish or stain has nicked off. I miss the gorgeous floors in our old house so much!: They are white oak, finished on site hardwoods and are gorgeous. (The stain color is Jacobean by Minwax.)And they have held up beautifully. You pay for that quality -- they are labor intensive to install, but so worth it! Compared to our current engineered flooring, those were pristine (and we lived with those for way longer).We find a new scratch or nick in our engineered hardwoods often. It's not too bad...usually we don't even notice them until we're cleaning. It's when I'm vacuuming and trying to pick up what I think is dirt that I see them: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

So let’s dive right into the 3 categories that we cover each year: Gift Ideas for Grown-Ups Gift Ideas for Kids Gift Ideas Under $12.99 Every year that we make these, we love including actual things that we own and enjoy, as well as things that we’re buying for others (like our own kids, each other, and relatives/friends). Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it). Quick note: The “Under $12.99” list isn’t the only one with items priced that low – for example, there are also two gifts under $12.99 on the kids list.

We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it. I won’t recap our entire decision to downsize (you can see the full explanation here) but the highlights are: We used to live in a 3,150 sq. ft. home in suburban Richmond, Virginia Now we live in a 1,400 sq.
