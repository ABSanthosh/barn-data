    "description": "When Colombian furniture company MUMA sought to produce a new office chair, they turned to ID consultancy Curve ID. MUMA's brief was both wide open and challenging: 'Design a task chair to bolster market share in South America, whilst considering international expansion'. Our response needed to be ultra sensitive to the local market and manufacturing opportunities, yet also create interest in a crowded sector overseas. The brief provided scope for all of our team's talents to shine, allowing us to draw on our experience with international clients; to use our anthropological approach to research; to demonstrate our materials and manufacturing expertise; and showcase how we help analyze and create market categories. In order to strengthen MUMA's domestic success, we needed to develop the chair with true, local, South American input. From the initial user research through to investigation of the manufacturing facilities, everything took place on-site in South America. One bonus of having access to local manufacturing facilities early in the process was the ability to incorporate efficient manufacturing techniques. A simplified one-piece seat back was developed knowing it could be properly molded in the local facility. This direct factory correspondence also helped immensely with the development of the chair's support skeleton, which was particularly crucial when using a complex resin such as Hytrel RS by DuPont™. The result? \"Ingo\" – a stylish, multi-functional, ergonomically high-end task chair that clever design and manufacturing will see priced in the mid-range category. Ingo is already gaining huge sales interest in its home market, but is also proving to have universal appeal. You can see more of Curve ID's work here.",

    "description": "Early Christmas decor finds for this holiday season!I don't usually buy a whole lot of new Christmas decor each year, but I found some cute items this year that really caught my eye! Many of you aren't even considering holiday decor just yet, and I totally appreciate that. :) It's crazy how early the stuff comes out in stores now, but it's even crazier how fast it sells out! These finds were different than most of the Christmas items I've seen out and about this year, and nearly everything was on sale when I purchased!I'm sharing a few simple ways to display these holiday decorations as well. The first decor items I found were these really cute accordion (they are also calling them honeycomb) trees in cream and green: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   I thought they were so unique, but after I purchased them I started seeing this style ALL over the place. It's definitely the trend this year. I'm trendy on time for once! 😂The trees assemble in seconds -- they connect together with magnets. They would be great in multiples along a shelf or console table. Thread some fairy lights throughout and you have a beautiful vignette in just a few minutes. The cream trees have more of a traditional look, and the green ones are softer and more rounded. There are also skinnier red versions that I didn't see in my local Walmart. Bonus: they fold up flat to store away for next year. I found a couple really cute entertaining/serving pieces recently as well. This Christmas platter from Michael's had the sweetest little details: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Where to find the best throw pillow covers for under $20!I'm back to share my favorite resources for cute and affordable pillow covers. I love sharing where I find home decor at a great price.  Pillow covers are one of those things I switch out more often than any other decor item. If you get them for a good price, they're an easy way to change up the accent colors in a room. I also like to use different textures and colors for the seasons.  I've found some sources for budget-friendly throw pillow covers (and inserts) over the years -- the prices are so good! ALL of the throw pillow covers I'm sharing have a zipper and are under $20, and most are well under that, or come in a set of two. This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. I prefer covers instead of store-bought pillows these because they cut down on the storage space significantly. I wash and store them away for different seasons and holidays and then reuse the removable inserts in the new cases. I find softer down-like inserts more comfy than the traditional pillow stuffing. I've been using these lightweight down alternative pillow inserts because you can get them in SO many sizes. The prices are hard to beat! When you order your inserts, order one size larger than your pillow cover for a fuller look!  1. Amazon pillow covers Amazon has a ton of throw pillow cover options under $20. I LOVE these neutral windowpane pillow covers on our bed: The quality is great -- I've washed them numerous times. They are SO pretty. There's a similar striped version I usually have on our dining room window seat as well: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

Let me tell you, the joy of packing light (only for yourself! not the whole fam!) and having a few nights of sleepovers in a fun new place and exploring so freely (just us eating dessert for breakfast if we want to!)… it’s euphoric. And our latest trip that we enjoyed was a completely new spot for me! She grew up going to Sedona with her family, but I had never been! She didn’t have to work hard to sell me on it though – the gorgeous views, the warm temperatures, magical mystical vortexes, shops full of crystals, and this pool? Sold!

The building itself, however, had few redeeming features, and the interiors were particularly unpleasant to occupy, according to architects Zuzana\u0026Nicholas. The architects proceeded to completely transform the townhouse by gutting the interiors, flipping the two-storey floor plan, and enhancing the immediate landscaping. It’s now a refined and functional home that embraces its coastal locale.",
