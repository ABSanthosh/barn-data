It aims to consider the ergonomics of those working on a canvas rather than a desk. \"For painters, working on a vertical surface rather than horizontal one creates physical problems, mainly related to not having adequate arm support. Leo is a chair developed for canvas painters.\" \"Its seat, inspired by a horse's saddle allows a stable posture while guaranteeing great mobility in space.\" \"Its adjustable armrest provides support that adapts easily to different positions and heights.\" The Leo was Frizzarin's diploma project, and won a \"Très Bien\" mention.",

    "description": "I saw this and immediately thought \"The heck is this thing?\"I couldn't guess, even after seeing the use case photo: It's called a BraceBlok, and it's basically ballast. It's made by Batisec, a French manufacturer of construction site fencing. These objects, which are made out of concrete and skinned in plastic, weigh 50kg (110 lbs) and are used to brace temporary fencing. As ugly as I find the thing, I suppose form does follow function here. The centralmost cutout in the underside accommodates the separate black base (which weighs another 14kg) for the metal brace. The U-shaped notch admits the brace at an angle, and the Space-Invaders-like shape is so that the blocks can be stacked in transit. Nothing about this object, however, screams \"designed in France\" to me.",

    "description": "Step-by-step tutorial to recover a seat cushion with new fabric. You can give almost any upholstered dining or accent chair a brand-new look with minimal time and effort!  I've recovered quite a few chairs over the years, and some were easier than others. One of my most difficult DIY projects ever was recovering our upholstered dining room chairs years ago.  All six had fabric on the seat as well as the back, and removing all of it was one of the most tedious and annoying projects I've ever taken on. ;) I would rather not do that ever again.  But the process of cover the chairs with new fabric wasn't that bad at all! The easiest process when you have a chair with an upholstered seat cushion that is removable.  My latest project was in my office. I've had this more modern chair in there for years (this is the best pic of it with the new wallpaper and paint):  But the more I transformed this room, the more it felt of out of place. I wanted something a little cozier, a little warmer that fit in better.  I found the perfect chair on Facebook Marketplace. I loved the warm, dark wood tone and the caning on the back: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Tips to easily purge and declutter items from your home!Have you caught the decluttering bug yet this year? Is there anything better after the busyness and STUFF of the holiday season? The first few weeks of this year I was a decluttering FIEND. It's been a long time since I've focused so much on purging things from our house. It's been almost ten years since I went through our entire (old) house and decluttered EV.ER.Y.THING. Back then I wrote about how much I like the Konmari decluttering method and how I used it. The Konmari decluttering method.I think the part that can turn people off from this method is the main message -- asking yourself if the items in your home bring you joy. If not, let go of them. I mean, it's a little simplistic. I don't LOVE the whisk in our kitchen drawer, so why keep it? 😂 So when I use this process I focus on things that I truly enjoy and we use often. These two qualifiers make it much easier to figure out what to keep!Notice I said keep. This method makes me focus more on the things that I love, not things that don't serve us well. If I like and use it...it's easier to keep it in our home. If it doesn't fit, I don't like the color, isn't my style anymore AND I haven't used it in years...then I let it go without a second thought. For some reason, deciding what to keep is easier for me than determining what to give away. The Komari decluttering process worked so well for me, I've been really good at constantly asking myself those questions as I go about day to day life in our home. It's not unusual for me to donate a small bag of items every week. Home decor decluttering process.But after the holidays, I knew it was time to tackle a spot I never focus on. Our basement storage room is wonderful and has plenty of room to store items away, but it becomes a dumping ground (especially after Christmas).A few years ago I made an effort to organize the home decor items I was holding onto for future projects:This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.When I think back to how much STUFF we moved into this house almost eight years ago, I truly can't believe it. Even after doing the major purge before we moved, I did another HUGE home decor declutter about a year after we moved in. I still had a lot, knowing I would be building a few built ins around the house that would need decor. Now that the family room, office, dining and basement bookcases and builds are done, I can let go of a bunch. Right after Christmas, I stood in front of those plastic shelves and realized there was very little I had a desire to keep. When it hits, it hits. I wanted it GONE. Ha! I say this all the time, but the with each year of my life, I want less stuff in our house. At least stuff that isn't meaningful. In my 20's and 30's I often kept more than needed. I know that was a response to a difficult childhood -- it used to pain me to get rid of something I had spent money on. (Even if it was 20 years earlier.)So I gathered like items and placed them on a table so I could see what I was dealing with: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
