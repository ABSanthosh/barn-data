    "title": "HIIVE: From An Industrial Design Thesis to Market",
    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/135723/HIIVE-From-An-Industrial-Design-Thesis-to-Market",
    "description": "Although Phillip Potthast has been reading Core77 since his time as an industrial design student, he never anticipated that he might one day appear in its pages talking about bees. \"I was more into automotive and car design, actually,\" he reminisces. \"And I've just pivoted, one hundred and eighty degrees, into tree hollows.\"Phillip Potthast's novel beehive design, HIIVE, evolved out of an industrial design thesis that originally sought to create a more ergonomic hive. After venturing into the field, however, Potthast witnessed first-hand the beekeepers' treatments against Varroa mites - a common honeybee parasite - and the aftereffects that these treatments had on the bees themselves. Ergonomics, he quickly realized, may not be the most pressing challenge that many beekeepers faced.When you're so happy with your molded parts you show them the beach at sunset.Honey bees help to pollinate as much as three-quarters of all flowers, and a third of the world's crops. These crucial critters, however, now find themselves also facing modern stressors like climate change, pesticides, and industrial food systems. In response, Potthast's designs aim to improve a beehive's overall health by harkening back to the era before humans developed the squat, utilitarian, honey-farming bee boxes that now dominate your average apiary. Left to their own devices in nature, honeybees often set up shop in the hollows of centuries-old tree trunks.\"Bees actually behave a bit like a power plant,\" Potthast explains. \"In summer and winter alike, they manage a relatively complex thermodynamic and hydrodynamic system. They constantly create a microclimate, which we specifically support through our product.\" Even when the outside temperature drops to freezing, this cluster of bees can maintain a core temperature as high as thirty degrees Celsius while safely nestled in HIIVE's 44-liter cavity. The bees enter through an angled \"flight hole\" at the bottom, which enables both easy entry and defense against intruders.\"The first prototypes, actually, had been just for the bees. It was a nightmare to use,\" Potthast recalls, sitting within arm's reach of a HIIVE in the company's offices, on the outskirts of Berlin. \"It only became human-centered and user-friendly in the second phase.\"Some of HIIVE's current design stems not just from human usage, but human regulation (under German law, for example, beehives must provide access to the breeding room to allow testing for American foulbrood, a spore-forming bacterium that can be fatal to colonies). Compared to classic hives, HIIVE also does not aim to maximize extraction of honey for human consumption. This novel model, however, has occasionally resulted in a significant learning curve for novice beekeepers.\"We have a really, really low Varroa mite pressure in our beehives,\" Potthast says, referring to the degree of infestation (for which beekeeping guidelines typically suggest a treatment every few months, to keep the infestation below two mites for every hundred bees). \"For some people, it's even hard to believe if they don't try it themselves. We have the customers thinking they don't have Varroa pressure, and therefore some of them think they don't need treatments. But you have to read the bees in a much different way than in a box.\" Since its launch, HIIVE been working to release a full tutorial for their users: \"You can do so much wrong with bees,\" Potthast cautions.Early on, Phillip Potthast found a willing collaborator in his partner, Fabian Wischmann, whose knowledge of business and startups became a key ingredient of HIIVE's success. Together, Potthast and Wischmann launched a Kickstarter in 2022 that exceeded their goals more than fifteen-fold - raising over 140,000 Euros, from hundreds of backers. Their success, however, did not come about purely organically. \"You really have to invest substantial amounts to gain necessary visibility,\" Potthast notes. \"It's a pay-to-win system. You need an advertising agency. Otherwise, you're just going totally under.\"The HIIVE team did, unfortunately, encounter multiple production delays over the following two years (suppliers that ordered the incorrect steel, for instance). But HIIVE remains quite satisfied with their partners: some of their 2023 updates, for instance, included videos of the injection molding at Irmamolde facilities in Portugal; the HIIVE's fabric cover, meanwhile, comes from a German mountaineering company, VAUDE, that already had experience making waterproof, UV-resistant PFAS-free gear (PFASs, or \"per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances,\" are a group of synthetic chemicals notorious as persistent organic pollutants, also known as \"forever chemicals\"). Backers' orders began to ship early last year.The vast majority of HIIVE's supporters - ninety-six percent, at HIIVE's count - consider themselves hobbyists. One such backer, Thomas Zimmerling of Frankfurt, has a day job as a managing director of a consulting firm, but happily testified to his experiences with the HIIVE after almost a year of use. \"The materials are extremely high quality,\" Zimmerling reported, in an email to Core77. \"HIIVE requires less effort [than traditional hives]: I can check the condition of the bee colony very quickly, don't have to worry about additional insulation in winter, and can treat against the Varroa mite very easily.\"Another one of HIIVE's most compelling features, however, is still waiting to be released. \"This is our sensor,\" Potthast says, dangling a small collection of circuit boards and wires in his fingers. \"It's beautiful,\" he muses, admiringly. \"A masterpiece of electrical engineering. The result of cross-disciplinary collaboration - which is not solely my achievement.\"Although each HIIVE can function without the sensor and accompanying gateway - a palm-sized device with three finger-sized antennas - the electronics would allow keepers to monitor a swarm's activity, arrival, or even level of vibrations within the hive (as a proxy for the brood's health and mood).These electronic components, however, have taken significant time to perfect. \"The sensors have a runtime of one year,\" Potthast says. \"Taking something to such a low power is a lot of work, and also a lot of engineering.\" HIIVE has also been saddled with having to certify three different radio signals - LoRaWAN, WiFi, and BLE - across multiple countries. This array of signals aims to cover multiple use cases - from HIIVEs kept within wifi range in a back garden, to a keeper who keeps them on a distant property and would utilize a GSM module (as used in cell phones) to monitor them from afar. As a result, HIIVE is currently in the process of launching a second Kickstarter - but this time, purely for the electronics.Going forward, Potthast feels especially excited to have their work officially assessed by animal scientists, whose research he'd heavily incorporated into HIIVE's design. \"All the bullet points from the scientists that they'd gathered over the years,\" Potthast explains, \"by observing tree hollows, the most natural home of honeybees: we took these scientific findings, shaped them, and turned this knowledge about bee tree hollows into a product/tool to make it accessible for beekeepers and their animals.\" Just this year, HIIVE has partnered with a consortium of bee scientists who have undertaken observations on a set of ten hives, which would help grant legitimacy to the company's claims of having such low Varroa mite pressure.\"Normally, as an industrial designer, you take care of usability: things have to look nice, and shiny, and the most ergonomic,\" Potthast opines. \"But to mimic a 200 to 300-year-old tree hollow? That was quite a task.\"",

    "description": "It's been a few years since we asked \"Why are wi-fi routers so darned ugly?\" This Vibrant WiFi router, by Seoul-based industrial design firm Intenxiv, aims to change that. \"Wireless internet routers have traditionally been hidden away due to their unconventional shapes, limited design options, and complex connections. To overcome this, we have conceptualized, designed, and manufactured a Switchable Skin System that allows users to freely customize the color, material, and finish (CMF) of their router, seamlessly integrating it into their space.\" \"With this system, routers are no longer just functional devices—they become a harmonious part of interior aesthetics while maintaining optimal performance.\" \"For this project, we took charge of the entire CMF design, visualization (rendering), exhibition planning, booth design, and installation, bringing digital representations to life with hyper-realistic details while ensuring a seamless physical presentation. This approach enables us to propose a new direction where connectivity and aesthetics coexist effortlessly.\" The Vibrant WiFi router is in production by Korea Telecom.",

Soda? Won't they get all mushy and gross and taste like...soda?But I went with it and I'm so glad I did! How can something so simple and easy taste so good? SO. GOOD.

    "description": "My tips for finding beautiful treasures on Facebook Marketplace! If you love vintage and unique decor in your home, then the Facebook Marketplace will become your favorite source for interesting pieces!  Recently, especially over the past year or so, the seasonal decor releases at places like Target and Walmart are just hitting me differently.  It's hard to find something unique -- all of the decor items start to look the same after a while.  Over the past few years I've fallen back in love with thrifting and antiquing. It helps that our teenage son enjoys it too -- he loves looking for vintage sports memorabilia.  Late last year I clicked on the little marketplace button at the bottom of my FB page while winding down in bed one night. I was surprised at all of the beautiful pieces that were both interesting and full of character.  I started logging in everyday to check out the finds. It's easy to get slightly addicted once you find a few treasures!  In the past few months I've learned a lot about successfully shopping on this app, so figured I would share my tips along with some of my finds! 1. Search for keywords and add filters. Looking through all of the listings can become a major time suck, so searching by terms helps to whittle down the items.  You can use any word you'd like -- wood or metal, new or used. Or search a specific design style you love like modern or farmhouse. Not only can you use keywords, but you can set a price range, condition, color and more to filter your search: I love just about anything brass, so I use that every so often to look for treasures. These brass library bookends were one of my first finds: Love the candlestick in front of the books!  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.
