    "description": "Videochats have become indispensable for businesses, but they're no substitute for a face-to-face meeting. The lack of accurate eye contact is jarring, and it's a lot harder to read visual cues when staring at a tiny head in a laptop screen. Additionally, Steelcase learned during user research, people find videoconferencing mentally exhausting.\"People need better hybrid collaboration options -- especially in a time where we are spending so much of our day on video -- so we wanted to create a more realistic experience that would help combat digital fatigue,\" says Steelcase's Christina Vernon, general manager of distributed collaboration and tech partners. \"Project Ghost was an experiment to see if people could connect virtually in the same way they might over a cup of coffee. What we found through all of our conversations and in-person demonstrations was that people were craving this kind of immersive and distraction-free experience to really improve their connections with their colleagues.\"Project Ghost, which was undertaken in collaboration with Logitech, was a trial to see if the companies could jointly create a better videoconferencing experience. The project's experimental prototypes have grown into a finished product, Ocular View. This dedicated videoconferencing booth seats two and, the companies reckon, provides multiple advantages over computer-based Zooms:Ocular View includes a comfortable lounge, small table and soft lighting to help participants look and feel their best. The space was intentionally designed to eliminate distractions, placing the technology secondary to the physical environment. Participants simply tap to join to start the realistic conversation. [The system uses] an effect that removes the remote participant from their background and displays a life-size rendering. The camera also creates eye-to-eye contact by connecting sight lines to create a natural gaze, so people feel as though they are engaging in-person. \"When starting on this project, we asked ourselves how we could create a more human connection where technology fades into the background and people are front-and-center,\" says Alex Mooney, Logitech manager. The goal was to remove \"the obvious presence of technology to focus on the engagement between two people.\" The units come in three different footprints, including a wheelchair-accessible one, and you can spec a variety of panel options.

It's so named because you install it by \"corking up\" the end of the bar, and now you've got a handy rearview mirror (polycarbonate, not glass) you can flip out. It's attached via a ball joint, so you can dial in the angle. Made by French bike accessories company The Beam, these run $38. They also sell a Corky Urban variant for ordinary handles.

    "description": "How to make EASY Christmas bows for your holiday decor! Simple instructions to make fluffy DIY bows, from small to big, for your Christmas decorations.  I searched for \"easy Christmas DIY bows\" a few years ago and tried at least three versions (that seemed incredibly easy).  Each time I ended up with a mess of ribbon that looked NOTHING like what they showed.  I finally found a simple bow that ended up looking pretty cute, so I wanted to share the easy steps! You only need two things for this quick tutorial -- wired ribbon (I think I had 30 yards) and wire of some kind. You can use wire, floral wire, pipe cleaners...anything like that will work.  1. Cut your ribbon to long lengths First up, cut one long piece of ribbon at around five feet (I ended up making them a bit longer, around 65 inches) and a shorter piece at two feet.  You'll see the size of the bows with these measurements in this post -- adjust the lengths to your liking!  Then place the long one on a surface like so: src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEisgxUQ7mMJs_cmJWuWHiPUMsqqTkWyZNkwb53FA5W2kba1P9NMQJ6y7wZE1Zm2luxzVeOQt7euTP45wif3IYS3VnqZ2mfqE7z9LcaT76x4DQUpRCnmLI1tvOQa_tpuUB8p6SyTNLLe5AQ/s16000/IMG_9870.jpg\"\u003e This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.     Using wired ribbon will make this much easier -- it keeps its shape as you go.  I had to study the photo as I did this because I kept doing it backwards. You just lay it flat and then pull one side over, then the other.  You may want to widen that part at the top as you go, that will be the back part of the bow. 2. Make your ribbon loops Then, take the smaller section of ribbon and overlap the ends a bit like so: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How to add a DIY library paneling molding look to your walls. Install your own wall molding (and save a ton!) that gives you that classic library/dark academia look.  Last I left you on my office makeover, I had installed the peel and stick wallpaper, removed and installed the new baseboards, installed the chair rail and given everything a couple coats of paint:  src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4jopEj9wjsj8HIOO-PsOATH1_DeXdnazTqWXszpIRT9mzlEkoAd4U4kpN-quAQy5Wv-4uryzulNakpXykBGMSejOLM9WymhYMXCMyFDfQkWFuaamzm-Kzxje7JnlMXHz2SEzkoAAWNQzymFPTM6hrSyHcWOU-8T05rxlIGgs1JmGXkNA2GlWUswKz67U/s16000/green%20trim%20grasscloth%20wallpaper.jpg\"\u003e That pretty green paint color is called Vintage Vogue -- it's a Benjamin Moore color, but I have it mixed at Sherwin-Williams.  You can read all about that process and the grasscloth wallpaper I used here.  After that, I stalled out on the DIY stuff (because: marching band season) till recently. My goal for the lower third of the wall was to create a library paneling type of look.  There are so many ways to add character to your walls with molding. For this room, I wanted it to be a simple but beefy look that adds some detail to this room.  Step One: Deciding on your design I ended up doing a classic look using two pieces of molding. Simple, primed one by twos and this cove trim:  src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcCKs_avyABffKvSfWkDZvlCWipvBV24wLWD5pfxSt9Go5dL_9kLZ3TEN2qlCn2nPy3U5cbxJ-KhBSBWdaxsZIsDunSiY5NoS0069uK8X9elU1QtcIrBHoJXYNv3huFCt6XUs77fpZD5HbWKSPycPnsKeCLq9HY8TKGfxCAAnFUEW_dEnqPWNkCv8fn5w/s16000/vinyl%20curved%20molding.jpg\"\u003e This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    When those curved pieces are placed on each side, it really makes that thin 1x2 feel much more substantial: src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjivUqajw5lmCvq4r8o6Ch1EWOgKxj0Z0BqVROiElip7e75nxGY5hyphenhyphensgcjTQe07sXXhonU9mv0E8oRuU5y_Yg09bfu-n4D_WFyHsaAbGma5eEiEeznqdbZHZ9UBR0vAnYfb20mERrSlRs3QYmkrZKOeq5QL-Km8hCLw0o7086JuxAZ8TLTVnPBvA8kNuus/s16000/DIY%20library%20paneling.jpg\"\u003e The curved molding is actually a paintable vinyl product that is great for outside and in bathrooms. I like that it's lightweight, easy to cut and cheaper than wood.  I had already added the curved trim to the top of the chair rail. Usually I would go with a simple 1x2, but I really like how this turned out with that coved look on top and bottom of each piece of trim.  Before I got started, I needed to fix some gaping in the baseboards and chair rail. It was only bad along the long wall in the room: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it. I won’t recap our entire decision to downsize (you can see the full explanation here) but the highlights are: We used to live in a 3,150 sq. ft. home in suburban Richmond, Virginia Now we live in a 1,400 sq.
