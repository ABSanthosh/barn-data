    "description": "When Bosch wanted to produce their own espresso maker, they leveraged both their in-house design team and Munich-based ID firm Fluid. The result was this Tassimo concept:The ChallengeDevelop an iconic range of espresso maker concepts for the Tassimo system that serves as a strong and inspiring foundation for the Bosch in-house team for further development. The SolutionThe selected concept Tassimo Finesse captures the ritual of coffee culture in the context of entry-level coffee machines. In this product range, design character and the expression of coffee pleasure are key purchase drivers. Creating a vision \u0026 narrative for in-home coffee experiences In close collaboration with the Bosch in-house design team, we created an exciting range of coffee machine concepts targeting the entry-level market with both, contextual desirability and feasibility at their core. The overall archetype, gestures and character of the selected concept Tassimo Finesse were maintained from concept stage all the way to the marketed product. The first step towards a more mature Tassimo brand expressionTassimo Finesse celebrates coffee heritage and the daily ritual we build around this beverage. The architectural design expresses culture, elegance and tradition while modern and soft details promise approachability, wittiness and joy.The proud brewing head is elevated and becomes an iconic design element, showcasing both, coffee quality and ease of use without losing the Tassimo charisma. The strong gesture of the machine displays a serving gesture, ready to accommodate the user's needs. The Story of a great partnershipThe Tassimo Finesse project serves as a perfect example of the closely-knit partnership between FLUID and the in-house teams at Bosch Home Appliances - a partnership in which we share and discuss early ideas, sketches and first product narratives, develop detailed CAD models, support each other during consumer tests and collaborate closely during design refinement.Powerful synergy effectsFor many years now, we have worked closely with the Bosch Home Appliances in-house team - on numerous projects ranging from industrial design to user interface design, user experience design, and strategic design. Over these years we have developed a deep understanding of each other and now benefit from a strong synergy between projects.You can see more of Fluid's work here.",

    "description": "How to make these easy and fun floating witch hats for your front porch or inside! I've wanted to make these cute DIY \"floating\" luminary witch hats for our porch for years! They turned out to be a really easy way to add some cute Halloween decorations to our front porch, but you could hang them anywhere for easy decor. I tried a couple methods of creating these hanging hats with two lighting options, and I'll share both here. Both are very simple, but one is so simple it only take a couple minutes to create each witch hat luminary.  I started with these inexpensive black witch hats:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    This witch hat set came with 12 hats and a bunch of cute plastic bat cutouts as well. (This set has six hats if you don't need as many.)  My first tutorial uses LED votives that operate on a timer -- once you turn them on, they'll run for a certain amount of time. So turn them on in the evening and they'll operate every evening after. I used fishing line for this project because you want the hats to look as though they're floating around on your porch. :) If you don't have that on hand, dental floss works as well. (These don't weigh much!)  How to make your witch hats glow I tied the line around the \"flame\" of the votives: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How to build long wood DIY picture ledges in minutes. These wood picture ledge shelves can be customized to the length and width you need and are a great way to display art and photographs!If you do a lot of DIYing, you may have enough scrap wood on hand to make these. If not, they can be made affordably with basic pine from the hardware store. When we moved into this house, I knew immediately I wanted to do something fun on our staircase walls. This project in particular was on the wall under the stairs: It needed something -- and I imagined some simple display shelves with photos along this wall. First I stuck some painter's tape to the wall to figure out the sizes of each one and get an idea of how it would look. I built three, four and five foot shelves. I wanted to go down low on the wall as much as possible because it just felt right visually to me. These shelves only come out about four inches from the wall. To build these you'll need three pieces of wood -- one 1x2 for the front, one 1x3 for the base, and one 1x4 for the back, all cut to the length you want. You can also make the shelf with a 1x4 on the bottom so it would be a bit deeper. I found the three inch to be fine but if you plan on leaning a bunch of frames I'd go with the four inch. You can see what I mean here:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
