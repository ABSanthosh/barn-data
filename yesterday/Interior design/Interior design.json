    "description": "EASY and inexpensive ways to clean gunk out of a drain There are two simple and very effective ways to clean to clear gunk and hair out of your drains without using harsh chemicals. And with one method you'll have everything you need in your kitchen.  One of these drain clearing methods works better in the kitchen on built up foods and fats, and the other works well in bathroom sinks and showers where the clog culprit is most likely from hair down the drain. We used to grab the Drano (and an even more caustic product once -- never again) every time the water started to slow in our sinks. No more! These methods work every time and it only takes a few minutes to use each drain cleaning hack.  Why you should clean your sink drains Well I think most of us understand why. At least we know when sinks start to drain slow they need to be cleared out. But I'm guilty (and I think a lot of us are) of not doing it enough.  In a kitchen, there are fats, oils and other foods that gunk up pipes over time. (Did you know even pasta is bad for your pipes?) In the bath, it's the dreaded hair. And unless you're diligent and stay on top of it all the time, clogs happen eventually. If you're not treating your drains right, eventually you'll need to clear out the pipes.  And your sink will probably be stinky. Ever had a foul smell in the kitchen you can't place? This is probably it. Cleaning out the food goo and gunk This one is typically used in kitchens where you have the thick build up of fats and gooey food. I used to use the old school method of hot water, then baking soda and finally vinegar to clear a kitchen drain.  But years ago I heard of a more effective and even easier way to get it done...and I've never gone back! I try to do this every six months or so, but as we've already discussed...drains aren't usually something I think of cleaning regularly. You'll only need a couple \"ingredients\" to flush the built up food and fats in your kitchen drain.  First up, boil a saucepan full of water. If your drain is already backed up or running slow, you may need to do this numerous times or boil a lot more water to start: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Adorable spring and Easter decorating ideas. Easy and cute ways to add some spring touches around the house with beautiful florals and decor. As much as I LOVE the fall season, there's something so special about the start of spring after a very cold and snowy winter. Our weather has felt more like summer around here lately, and it has me in the mood to clean up the garden beds and haul out the spring decor. I picked up a few new pieces and used some old ones to add some sweet touches around the house!This light and pretty decor has put us all in such a good mood! :) I found these cute bunnies in the Target dollar section this year: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    They had smaller versions last year that are just as detailed. This trio of gold bunnies was a new find this season: I seem to like bunnies in a set of three. ;) I love their cute poses! They are bigger than the Target versions: There's also a set with really adorable Easter egg votive holders as well. I've had two fuzzy green bunnies on sticks from Pier One (RIP) years ago. I've never found a good spot for them, but this year I cut down the sticks and placed them in this greenery in our foyer:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

The garden anchors the owners and local birdlife to their environment, and beckons the family outdoors at every opportunity.",
