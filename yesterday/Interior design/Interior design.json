    "description": "When NYC-based pet products company Diggs wanted to create a lightweight travel kennel, they turned to industrial design firm Pensa. Is it possible, they wondered, to create an inflatable kennel that could stand up to the rigors of travel—and dogs? Pensa answered with the following Enventur design, which is now on the market. The reimagined travel kennelSay goodbye to bulky, heavy and cumbersome dog travel kennels. The Diggs Enventur Inflates in minutes. It is designed and constructed with the same drop stitch materials and construction found in inflatable kayaks and paddle boards, bringing premium safety and comfort wherever you go with your dog.The kennel is designed with generous ventilation, is ultra-lightweight, extremely durable, and works as an incredibly comfortable home away from home for your dog. It is waterproof, and made with easy to clean, phthalate-free materials. New construction and materials for the categoryWe used an iterative approach creating dozens of quick concept mock-ups, first with cardboard and foam core, and ultimately with the real materials. We used these mock-ups to understand how the materials and geometries of the various drop-stitch panels would inflate and collapse predictably and repeatedly. A smooth and seamless experienceOnce we had a working architecture, the challenge was connecting these panels together allowing air to flow from the pump through the system, and once inflated, resulting in a smooth shape. The resulting clean, smooth simplicity of the outer form is a key design attribute, making the kennel extremely durable, portable, and easy to clean either by wiping it down or spraying with a hose. You can see more of Pensa's work here.",

    "description": "Five ways to save money on plants and flowers this planting season.Gardening is one of my favorite pastimes, but also one of the most expensive! Over the years I've come up with quite a few ways to save on both annual and perennial plants this time of year. Sometimes I will still splurge on a plant or tree, but for the most part these methods will save me a TON on flowers, bushes and trees for our gardens and yard. I've planted or replanted a TON of plants this spring (most were small, individual flowers) and have loved watching them thrive. I gathered my top five ways to save on plants this spring and summer! 1. Pick spreading plantsI love our window boxes, but they can be expensive to fill every spring. I learned years ago that using flowers that spread will make my money go a lot further. My favorite has always been the Wave Petunias because they multiply like crazy and cascade out of boxes or containers: These are the only annual flowers I plant each year because they spread and fill in so beautifully. Annuals only last one season, perennials will come back year after year.For your landscaping, look for ground cover or flowers that spread, like this awesome sedum plant I showed you years ago:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

You'll need a few tools in order to hang them so that they withstand the elements. You'll also need to consider where you are hanging them from to ensure they will be sturdy over time. I've compiled all of the methods -- whether you have mature trees, a solid wood fence...or nothing at all in your backyard!This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. The best string lights that will last!I tried a few options when we first installed patio cafe lights at our first house years ago. I felt like Goldilocks -- some were too wimpy and the bulbs broke easily. A lot of them weren't nearly long enough for what we needed. The lights we ended up using are still going strong ten years later! They are the industrial grade Feit incandescent string lights and when I found out they are what most businesses (restaurants especially) use, I was sold.Many of my readers suggested these way back then -- thank you! You can usually find these light strands at Costco too. We used them on our outdoor dining area under the wood pergola at that house:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

I know so many people tend to get \"stuck\" when it comes to making their own decorating decisions for their home. We might worry too much about what other people will think (especially for those of us who post our homes on social media, since we have Instagram telling us what people like or don't like). We sometimes worry too much about the impact our changes will have on a future sale, even if we are making good decisions and have no plans to move any time soon. We worry that we are making a design or budget mistake, even if our heart knows it's what would bring us more joy.",
