    "description": "Industrial designer Gustav Rosén and business partner David Lindell recently launched Kord, a Swedish design brand. Their stock-in-trade, at least to start, is power. \"We saw an opportunity to take something as common as power strips,\" says Lindell, \"and give them a distinct presence and design that feels natural in both homes and other environments. There are few products in this segment that deliver both function and aesthetics – and we wanted to fill that gap.\"Their inaugural product is the Cuboid, a diminutive power strip—sorry, cube—with four outlets. A Cuboid+ variant features three outlets and two USB-C ports. \"Cuboid is the result of a holistic understanding of the limits of geometry, technical constraints, functionality, and aesthetics,\" says Rosén. \"The asymmetric placement of the outlets gives the product character and originality. At the same time, it is the outcome of technical limitations and the ambition to create a beautiful yet highly compact object. The interaction between form and function brings clarity and purpose to the design. Cuboid is an excellent example of our ambition to merge technology and design in a way that creates value for the user.\"Both models come with a 2-meter cord, and the company bills them as the smallest multi-socket power strips in the world.They're also offering this optional Cumulus Case, which seeks to \"[transform] the Cuboid into a sculptural object.\" To me this seems a strange choice, one that actively works against purposefulness of the existing design. At press time, the recently-launced venture had yet to announce when they're going into production and where these will be available.",

    "description": "How to fix furniture damage and painting mistakes.  Recently I painted our dining room buffet and had SO many issues during the process. I'm sharing how I fixed all of them along the way and ended up with a gorgeous result!  I know better by now...I've learned to never say to myself \"Wow! This project is going so well!\" -- because something inevitably happens right after I say it.  Definitely can't think it, and never say it out loud. 😂 I also know I should never, ever EVER tell myself that a DIY project won't take long. I've done it a million times...this will be so easy! This won't take long at all! I've done this 800 million times, what could go wrong?  I know these things, and yet this is what I did.  Here's the culprit...the wood sideboard I purchased for our dining room a few months after we moved in:  A friend of mine owned a beautiful home decor shop, and I found it there about seven years ago. I was SO in love with it, especially the cane doors.  It fit in beautifully with the \"nod\" to farmhouse style that I had going throughout our house. It's also just a really useful piece -- I store a ton of serving dishes inside.  Later I built a wall of bookcases and a window seat at the end of this room and painted the main wall a dark blue with pretty picture frame molding.  Last year I switched gears completely and painted the whole room in a warm and lovely color called Pachyderm:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

    "description": "Our favorite pet stain remover spray that gets everything out with NO scrubbing!  I'm sharing a quick post about a pet stain remover we've used for years and LOVE. We can't live without this stuff now! This isn't a sponsored post, I just like to share things that work. If you have animals I think you'll find it worthwhile.Just a warning...these are the worst pictures you'll ever see on the blog. 😂 I can't get around not showing you so you can see how it works, so bear with me.   Our little chihuahua dog absolutely HATES going out when it's really cold out. He's fine most days, but when it's bone-chilling cold he will go in and out as fast as possible. I can't blame him!  This time of year we will occasionally find a little pee spot:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. About eight years ago I found a non-toxic pet stain spray called Furry Freshness on a Facebook ad of all places. I decided to try it out based on the raving reviews. It really is a miracle solution. I've never used anything like it! You just spray the spot enough so that it's saturated: And by the next day the stain will be gone (well, usually). Sometimes we have to spray again, but it's just the same process of saturating the stain. We've used this so many times in our house and I can't even find the spots where we sprayed.  Let it sit for the best results -- don't scrub it into the carpet, don't do anything! This was just a few hours later:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it). Quick note: The “Under $12.99” list isn’t the only one with items priced that low – for example, there are also two gifts under $12.99 on the kids list.
