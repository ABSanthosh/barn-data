    "description": "Dorel Juvenile is the world's leading juvenile products company. When they wanted to develop a new infant car seat, they turned to Pennsylvania-based ID firm DesignThink.DesignThink as the Innovation Incubator for the Ultra Lightweight Maxi Cosi Coral XP A Cold January Day in 2017The team at DesignThink was asked to visit Dorel Juvenile Group USA to review a \"Special Project\". The development team at Dorel JG wasted no time introducing us to their latest infant car seat (ICS) project. They were experimenting with the idea of developing a seat that would reduce the struggles parents faced when trying to transition their baby from the car and carry their baby in the removable seat portion of the ICS. The team at DesignThink has designed several car seats over the years and we instantly recognized the unique opportunity, as well as the challenge that this project offered, and were eager and excited to get started.Our Role as the Innovation IncubatorWe partnered with Dorel to act as the innovation incubator to lead the project team through the fuzzy front-end and define the product's overall features and characteristics of use. Upon successful concept definition, the project would be positioned under the Maxi Cosi brand and ultimately transferred to the Maxi Cosi team in Europe and a European design group to carry the innovation to production. The Problem at HandBy removing the seat from the base that is installed in the car, parents can take the baby with them while running errands or visiting people and places. However, a problem associated with this system is that some removable seats can weigh up to 16 lbs. and the baby can weigh up to 35 lbs. for a combined arm-crushing weight of 50+lbs.!! We established two primary goals: 1) reduce the overall weight of the seat to lighten the load, while maintaining structural integrity as to achieve a top crash test rating, and 2) develop new methods that enable parents to more easily lift the seat when moving in and out of the vehicle and when transporting the child in the seat. Our Approach (Decades of Experience and User Understanding Put to Test)DesignThink is one of the leading firms in car seat development having brought several seats to the market and has a long history of creating break-through innovation, but this project pushed our team in new ways. The structure for the project utilized DesignThink's simplified \"DEEP\" process;Define that for which we will solveExpress possible solutions as quick thumbnail storiesExplain the \"what – why – wow\" related to user needsPrototype to demonstrate the merits of the idea How the Project UnfoldedA series of innovation workshops were hosted at our studio to enable the team to think and problem solve with product at hand. The objective was to think in the \"ideal\" (do not worry about cost and construction initially) and to \"fail fast\" (explore, evaluate, and evolve). The following provided the high-level framework for how the team identified and pursued their ideas.Established Design TargetsLed by our usability team, along with team members from Dorel, we hosted a several day innovation workshop at our studio. We began with a collaborative defining of the design targets based on use, expectations, pain points, and opportunities, which we affinitized and moved directly into physical prototyping to address and evaluate how well the concepts improved the user experience during day-to-day interactions.DEEP: Innovation Workshops to prototype your idea. You are encouraged to be chaotic and messy! Fail fast! Dorel made sure plenty of product was on hand to fuel the innovation.Inutitive Carry Enhanced Confidence Improved Transitions Development of Design Targets Role-Play is the Best WayTo truly understand and empathize with users, we role-played, exploring typical use-case scenarios to inform our ideation. Placing ourselves in the same situations helps us quickly evaluate and improve our concepts.Handle-Carry:Evolution for improved ease when attaching the seat to the base and removing the child from the vehicle Cradle-Carry:Exploration to improve how parents can bond with the baby in a more natural holding position Cross-Body Strap:Exploration to provide alternate ways to carry the baby while reducing the effects of weight and fatigue on the parent Iterative User Evaluation CycleOur early thoughts and ideas were evaluated by the team and with parents in our research lab. These ideas were then refined to strengthen the evolving direction. The learnings obtained through this method enabled the team to focus on the most meaningful directions and build their value. Listening, understanding, and empathizing allowed our team to develop new ideas in this category that were previously unexplored.DesignThink presents the refined design direction. A series of prototypes and user evaluations enabled us to reach a stage of concept definition for an ultra lightweight car seat that provides parents with improved ways to carry, hold, and secure their baby. Our ResultsUser-Centered Insights lead to Market Defining SolutionsHaving developed many juvenile products such as car seats, strollers, and highchairs, DesignThink understands the day-to-day challenges parents face, both physically and emotionally. We embarked on this project with Dorel to define a new car seat with features that take into account those challenges and offer relevant and meaningful solutions. Exploring innovation that is rooted in user insights enabled our team to quickly define those solutions and overcome technical hurdles to deliver new experiences to address real problems faced by parents when using an ICS.Defining the DirectionAs mentioned, DesignThink was hired as the innovation incubator in the fuzzy front-end to develop and define a new architecture for this seat. Our work was documented and handed off to the Maxi-Cosi team in Europe. The output of our innovation incubation became the driving framework used by the teams in Europe to create a truly meaningful and relevant solution for parents in this category. The DesignThink team is very proud to have been selected by Dorel to play such an important \"behind the scenes\" role in setting the direction for, and contributing to the success of, the Maxi Cosi Coral XP.

    "description": "How to add a DIY library paneling molding look to your walls. Install your own wall molding (and save a ton!) that gives you that classic library/dark academia look.  Last I left you on my office makeover, I had installed the peel and stick wallpaper, removed and installed the new baseboards, installed the chair rail and given everything a couple coats of paint:  src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4jopEj9wjsj8HIOO-PsOATH1_DeXdnazTqWXszpIRT9mzlEkoAd4U4kpN-quAQy5Wv-4uryzulNakpXykBGMSejOLM9WymhYMXCMyFDfQkWFuaamzm-Kzxje7JnlMXHz2SEzkoAAWNQzymFPTM6hrSyHcWOU-8T05rxlIGgs1JmGXkNA2GlWUswKz67U/s16000/green%20trim%20grasscloth%20wallpaper.jpg\"\u003e That pretty green paint color is called Vintage Vogue -- it's a Benjamin Moore color, but I have it mixed at Sherwin-Williams.  You can read all about that process and the grasscloth wallpaper I used here.  After that, I stalled out on the DIY stuff (because: marching band season) till recently. My goal for the lower third of the wall was to create a library paneling type of look.  There are so many ways to add character to your walls with molding. For this room, I wanted it to be a simple but beefy look that adds some detail to this room.  Step One: Deciding on your design I ended up doing a classic look using two pieces of molding. Simple, primed one by twos and this cove trim:  src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcCKs_avyABffKvSfWkDZvlCWipvBV24wLWD5pfxSt9Go5dL_9kLZ3TEN2qlCn2nPy3U5cbxJ-KhBSBWdaxsZIsDunSiY5NoS0069uK8X9elU1QtcIrBHoJXYNv3huFCt6XUs77fpZD5HbWKSPycPnsKeCLq9HY8TKGfxCAAnFUEW_dEnqPWNkCv8fn5w/s16000/vinyl%20curved%20molding.jpg\"\u003e This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

I like that it's lightweight, easy to cut and cheaper than wood.  I had already added the curved trim to the top of the chair rail. Usually I would go with a simple 1x2, but I really like how this turned out with that coved look on top and bottom of each piece of trim.  Before I got started, I needed to fix some gaping in the baseboards and chair rail. It was only bad along the long wall in the room: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Early Christmas decor finds for this holiday season!I don't usually buy a whole lot of new Christmas decor each year, but I found some cute items this year that really caught my eye! Many of you aren't even considering holiday decor just yet, and I totally appreciate that. :) It's crazy how early the stuff comes out in stores now, but it's even crazier how fast it sells out! These finds were different than most of the Christmas items I've seen out and about this year, and nearly everything was on sale when I purchased!I'm sharing a few simple ways to display these holiday decorations as well. The first decor items I found were these really cute accordion (they are also calling them honeycomb) trees in cream and green: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   I thought they were so unique, but after I purchased them I started seeing this style ALL over the place. It's definitely the trend this year. I'm trendy on time for once! 😂The trees assemble in seconds -- they connect together with magnets. They would be great in multiples along a shelf or console table. Thread some fairy lights throughout and you have a beautiful vignette in just a few minutes. The cream trees have more of a traditional look, and the green ones are softer and more rounded. There are also skinnier red versions that I didn't see in my local Walmart. Bonus: they fold up flat to store away for next year. **I discovered these at Hobby Lobby as well! They sell them in sets of five in black, brown, cream and green.**I found a couple really cute entertaining/serving pieces recently as well. This Christmas platter from Michael's had the sweetest little details: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Nestled among towering apartment buildings in downtown Hiroshima, Japan, this seemingly modest three-storey family house by Tokyo-based architectural practice Hiroshi Nakamura \u0026 NAP is a remarkable achievement: it offers its occupants a serene, secluded oasis amid the city's hustle and bustle, despite being situated on a busy thoroughfare. To make this happen, the architects designed an “optical glass façade”, behind which they created a lush verdant courtyard, complete with trees, shrubbery, and a reflecting pool.",
