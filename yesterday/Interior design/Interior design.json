    "description": "This Toos concept is by Industrial Design students Jeoung Rae Kim, Shua Bong and Seunghee Lee, of South Korea's Hyupsung University. Collectively they call themselves Comma. \"As more people get older and have pets, pets have become like friends or family to older people. But most walking aids for seniors only have space for carrying bags or for the person to sit and rest, so it's hard for them to comfortably bring their pets along.\" \"To solve this problem, we suggest a new product that combines a pet carrier with a walking aid. It has a special space for pets and a seat where the person can rest.\" As someone who is getting older, and who has recently had to put multiple infirm dogs to rest, this is certainly something I can and would use in the future. It is heartbreaking to see elderly dogs who want to be outside, but whose infirmities make long walks impractical.",

Assuming it isn't AI generated—is it just me, or does the perspective in the room beyond look funky?—any guesses as to why a door would be modified in this way?A Redditor claiming to know states: \"This is for blackboards/whiteboards to be wheeled into and out of the room.\"Perhaps that's true. My next question is: How did they handle the header? Do you reckon it's just been moved above the highest point of the opening?",

    "description": "My tips for finding beautiful treasures on Facebook Marketplace! If you love vintage and unique decor in your home, then the Facebook Marketplace will become your favorite source for interesting pieces!  Recently, especially over the past year or so, the seasonal decor releases at places like Target and Walmart are just hitting me differently.  It's hard to find something unique -- all of the decor items start to look the same after a while.  Over the past few years I've fallen back in love with thrifting and antiquing. It helps that our teenage son enjoys it too -- he loves looking for vintage sports memorabilia.  Late last year I clicked on the little marketplace button at the bottom of my FB page while winding down in bed one night. I was surprised at all of the beautiful pieces that were both interesting and full of character.  I started logging in everyday to check out the finds. It's easy to get slightly addicted once you find a few treasures!  In the past few months I've learned a lot about successfully shopping on this app, so figured I would share my tips along with some of my finds! 1. Search for keywords and add filters. Looking through all of the listings can become a major time suck, so searching by terms helps to whittle down the items.  You can use any word you'd like -- wood or metal, new or used. Or search a specific design style you love like modern or farmhouse. Not only can you use keywords, but you can set a price range, condition, color and more to filter your search: I love just about anything brass, so I use that every so often to look for treasures. These brass library bookends were one of my first finds: Love the candlestick in front of the books!  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.
