    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/137338/Why-Americas-Streetlights-Have-Been-Turning-Purple",
    "description": "Right around the time of the pandemic, people across America began noticing something unusual: Streetlights were turning purple. In at least 30 states, people started taking photos like these, typically posting them to social media with questions.In this photo you can see that the effect isn't consistent across neighboring streetlamps. Scientific American got to the bottom of what was happening. All of the streetlamps that turned purple were LED \"upgrades\" from sodium lamps. LEDs cannot produce truly white light, just red, green or blue. To compensate, manufacturers use blue LEDs coated with phosphor. This phosphor layer distorts the blue wavelengths to produce a light that appears white.The phosphor layers in the affected lamps have been delaminating, yielding purple. In short, it's a manufacturing defect. American Electric Lighting, an Atlanta-based manufacturer that has federal contracts and makes (or at least assembles) their lights in America, is one of the suppliers that has acknowledged the malfunction. Other manufacturers have not been named.AEL, for their part, has been stepping up and replacing the affected lamps.",

    "description": "Home exercise equipment is typically bulky and unattractive. German manufacturer NOHRD breaks the mold by employing craftspeople to build their SlimBeam, a small-footprint cable machine designed to be aesthetically pleasing while taking up little space. Wrapped in wood, it features a set of height-adjustable pulleys in a butterfly arrangement, accommodating a variety of exercises. The weights are hidden in the back. I love this particularly German bit of product copy: \"The rubberized weight plates prevent any unpleasant clanking noises during your workout.\" There's an option to add a 7\" touchscreen monitor. Here we get a look at their actual production process:NOHRD does have U.S. distribution, and the machines start at $2,000 for the Oak finish; stepping up to Cherry and Walnut raise the price by $400 and $500, respectively.",

I rarely have things laying around anymore, because everything has a place.  I made some minor changes to my closet earlier this year that I'll share with you soon! This time I want to share the transformation of our teenage son's closet. I spared you the true before images. Let's just say it was a mess -- this is an area that had hardly been touched since we moved in nearly eight years ago! 1.
