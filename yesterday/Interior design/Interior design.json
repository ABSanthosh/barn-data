    "description": "Our favorite pet stain remover spray that gets everything out with NO scrubbing!  I'm sharing a quick post about a pet stain remover we've used for years and LOVE. We can't live without this stuff now! This isn't a sponsored post, I just like to share things that work. If you have animals I think you'll find it worthwhile.Just a warning...these are the worst pictures you'll ever see on the blog. 😂 I can't get around not showing you so you can see how it works, so bear with me.   Our little chihuahua dog absolutely HATES going out when it's really cold out. He's fine most days, but when it's bone-chilling cold he will go in and out as fast as possible. I can't blame him!  This time of year we will occasionally find a little pee spot:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. About eight years ago I found a non-toxic pet stain spray called Furry Freshness on a Facebook ad of all places. I decided to try it out based on the raving reviews. It really is a miracle solution. I've never used anything like it! You just spray the spot enough so that it's saturated: And by the next day the stain will be gone (well, usually). Sometimes we have to spray again, but it's just the same process of saturating the stain. We've used this so many times in our house and I can't even find the spots where we sprayed.  Let it sit for the best results -- don't scrub it into the carpet, don't do anything! This was just a few hours later:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Step-by-step tutorial to recover a seat cushion with new fabric. You can give almost any upholstered dining or accent chair a brand-new look with minimal time and effort!  I've recovered quite a few chairs over the years, and some were easier than others. One of my most difficult DIY projects ever was recovering our upholstered dining room chairs years ago.  All six had fabric on the seat as well as the back, and removing all of it was one of the most tedious and annoying projects I've ever taken on. ;) I would rather not do that ever again.  But the process of cover the chairs with new fabric wasn't that bad at all! The easiest process when you have a chair with an upholstered seat cushion that is removable.  My latest project was in my office. I've had this more modern chair in there for years (this is the best pic of it with the new wallpaper and paint):  But the more I transformed this room, the more it felt of out of place. I wanted something a little cozier, a little warmer that fit in better.  I found the perfect chair on Facebook Marketplace. I loved the warm, dark wood tone and the caning on the back: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it).

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/135375/Architecture-Student-Invents-Brilliant-Formwork-that-Reduces-Concrete-n-Steel-Usage",
    "description": "For the foreseeable future, we're simply not going to stop building with concrete and the steel necessary to reinforce it, despite the carbon emissions producing those materials requires. So it would be better if we could do more with less.Thanks to research done by Lotte Scheder-Bieschin, a PhD student of Architecture at ETH Zurich, we can. Scheder-Bieschin developed the \"Unfold Form,\" a reusable formwork system for making vaulted concrete structures. Her method yields a vaulted form that is as strong as a conventionally-built variant and uses less concrete and far less steel.Even more impressive is that Scheder-Bieschin also designed the formwork to be less wasteful. Creating forms for large, complicated concrete geometry often involves Styrofoam, and the forms are single-use. Scheder-Bieschin designed an origami-inspired reusable form that is easy to transport, as it folds down. It consists of flexible plywood strips joined by nothing more than textile hinges and staples. Each form weighs just 24kg, but can support a literal ton of concrete. And they're easy to move. \"I was looking for a solution that would allow me to use strength through geometry, not only to optimise the final structure but also the formwork itself,\" says Scheder-Bieschin. \"This approach reduces material usage and makes the entire process more environmentally friendly.\" The formwork's distinctive geometric structure allows for reductions of up to 60 percent in concrete and 90 percent in reinforcement steel. \"The Unfold Form formwork can be produced and assembled without specialised knowledge or high-tech equipment,\" notes Scheder-Bieschin. One of her aims was to create a simple and robust system that could be used worldwide, even with limited resources. Currently, formwork for non-standard concrete shapes typically requires digital fabrication. \"This creates barriers for sustainable concrete construction in developing countries, where the need for new buildings is especially high,\" she says. The formwork can be produced cheaply. \"The only things needed in addition to the materials are a template for the shape and a stapler,\" adds Scheder-Bieschin. The materials for the prototype cost only 650 Swiss francs in total. The individual components are light and compact enough to transport easily. Scheder-Bieschin demonstrated the system's simplicity by assembling it herself during her pregnancy. \"I wanted to ensure my design was simple enough for anyone to build, regardless of their circumstances,\" she says.Thus far two structures have been built using the Unfold Form, one at ETH Zurich, the other in South Africa. Once Scheder-Bieschin has gained her doctorate later this year, she plans to bring the product to market.",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/135374/Apple-Research-Yields-Expressive-and-Functional-Non-Anthropomorphic-Robot",
    "description": "Apple has a Machine Learning Research department, and it's yielded ELEGNT, a robotic desk lamp clearly inspired by Pixar. The lamp can be operated by both voice and gesture, and the researchers gave it two modes of doing things: \"Expressive,\" and \"functional.\"In the expressive mode it acts, well, cute, borrowing body language from dogs in order \"to interact more naturally with humans. In the functional mode, the lamp simply does what you ask it to do (change the direction of the lighting, for instance) without the theatrics. This will make more sense once you see the demo video:I like the gesture control and tracking ability, and the projected homework assistance is an interesting feature. But if I owned one of these as a product, I'd only ever set it to functional.There's a reason for that. Previously, we looked at Disney Research's work in designing cute, expressive robots. Their goal was also to enhance human-robot interactions.Last year I felt this was a promising direction of research, but I've rethought that position, giving the way things are going in the world. If right now you were to log onto any forum—discussing politics, truck accessories, gardening techniques, sci-fi books, dog training, whatever—and write a post disagreeing with or questioning a popular opinion, watch how quickly it devolves. It is very easy to get humans to behave rudely. Creating a future where robots are always nice, lulling people to form attachments to them while human-to-human interactions continue to unravel, may not be wise.",
