    "description": "In this age of disposable furniture, you know you've got a winning design when people are still talking about it a decade after its debut. Veteran industrial designer Todd Bracher created this timeless Trea chair in collaboration with Humanscale in the mid-2010s. The elegant, lobster-exoskelton-inspired form has been popular enough to warrant multiple spin-offs; the original Four Star four-legged office chair on casters has been joined by a taller High Task verison, a caster-less Four Leg version and a Cantilever model. Now the entire Trea series, which won a Red Dot Award upon its debut in 2015, has snagged a 2025 iF Design Award, besting thousands of entrants in the Office category. \"Merging simplicity with sophistication, Trea delivers intuitive ergonomic support to any workspace. Designed in collaboration with renowned designer Todd Bracher, Trea's innovative solid-state recline mechanism provides seamless, natural movement without manual adjustments. Its contoured shell is thoughtfully crafted to support the body's curves, enhancing lower back support and mimicking the hips' natural rotation. With a minimalist aesthetic and versatile design, Trea is ideal for professional, home, and 'third place' environments, offering both comfort and style.\" \"Inspired by nature, Todd Bracher collaborated with Humanscale to create the Trea Task Lite and Stool. Adaptable to both office and home environments, Trea's four-star, cantilever, stool, or four-leg bases are interchangeable, allowing it to be customised for different settings while maintaining visual consistency. True to Humanscale's belief in achieving more with less, Trea is crafted with fewer parts than a standard task chair, reducing its environmental impact while maximising efficiency.\" The Trea series is Living Product Certified, meaning it is climate, water, and energy positive. Congratulations to Bracher and Humanscale!",

    "description": "Chinese manufacturer Torras has designed this ZipGo, a charging block with a retractable USB-C cable. Designed for frequent travelers, the diminutive block is just 2.5\" x 1.5\" x 1\", smaller than Apple's standard kit.It delivers 40W, and the best part is you no longer need to pack and coil a separate cable.It's also got an additional USB-C port that does require a cable. If you use it for dual charging in this manner, the output is reduced to 20W per port. The ZipGo runs $40 (at least until the tariffs kick in).",

    "description": "Beautiful DIY ways to display mementos and keepsakes around your home. Framing photos or filling photo albums isn't the only way to display memorabilia -- these are simple ways  honor your special memories and create some fun conversation starters as well! It's been a sentimental few months for our family! Our son is graduating high school in a soon and we're experiencing a lot of \"lasts\" with him lately. (I know many firsts are to come too, it is very bittersweet!)And as I shared in my last post, we recently had to say goodbye to our sweet dog of 14 years, Peanut. Needless to say, I've been a bit emotional. 💙Early this year I started decluttering like crazy -- it's been years since I've purged our home like that. This process included sorting through a lot of old bins and paperwork that have been stored away. During that decrapification I found so many items with such wonderful memories attached to them, and I was determined to figure out ways to display them in our home.I cannot tell you how much joy it has brought me to see so many of these throughout my day!Most of these ideas are easy to complete and don't cost much at all. A lot of our keepsakes are small -- I've struggled with adding them around the house because they look cluttered instead of cherished items. I've found that grouping them together makes them look more purposeful (and pretty!).When we moved years ago, I packed away a baggie of these matchbooks from our travels. I was so excited to find them again!:This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   This one was easy -- I just placed them in a decorative bowl by a candle. I can't tell you how many times I've gone through them in the past few months, reminiscing about the exact dinner or travel that corresponds to each one. Here are some more ways to display matchbook covers: Attach them to the back of a shadowbox frame to create artwork. Hot glue magnets to the back for a fun way to display them (this would work best with match boxes).Have an artist make custom artwork with your match covers -- this would be perfect if you don't have the physical book but can find examples online. I love the custom artwork idea, probably because we have something similar that a friend made for us: When my husband retired from teaching (he was a band director), a close friend had this beautiful art made with every school musical he had conducted over the years. It's one of our most treasured pieces and I think it would be a brilliant idea for a student who's involved in theater or the arts. You could make something similar with playbills from theater productions, artwork for marching band shows, or program covers from concerts. What a special way to honor a student or teacher! If you are knowledgeable with photo editing programs, you could make one of these yourself. During my purge I found a little container with a bunch of tiny keepsakes. It made me sad that they were hidden away, so I grabbed a display case I had and started adding the items: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Fresh and flavorful salad recipe with crunchy ramen noodles. I had the most delicious salad last week and immediately asked for the recipe from my friend. It's crunchy and sweet and has...ramen noodles! Weird, right? Hang in there, I promise it's so good!! As I age I find I like more foods. Do you find the same? I don't know if my tastes have matured over time, or that I'm just trying more foods than I used to. Up till a few years ago I didn't even like avocado -- now I could eat it with a spoon.  I actually avoided this salad at first because I didn't like most of the ingredients.

After some searching I realized this is a very popular recipe, but can vary quite a bit. It's a perfect dish for picnics or get togethers, especially in the warmer months.  This ramen salad is cold and crunchy and full of flavor: It's very quick and easy to put together! As usual, I have some edits and thoughts on the ingredients, so stay tuned.  Here's the list of ingredients: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Architect and director of Zarq Studio Zac Evangelisti and his wife Megan Garden purchased a 1920s Perth home in fair condition, albeit with several ‘bizarre’ and inconsistent modifications. Its weatherboard addition needed to go, and the original rooms called for a lot of love, but Zac and Megan were attracted to the area and its ‘blank slate’ appeal. They spent over two years restoring the front rooms and adding a glamorous Italian-inspired extension connected to the garden and sky. There’s something in every room designed to draw the eye, from textured limewash walls, to swirling marble, and greenery outside cascading from newly established roof gardens.",
