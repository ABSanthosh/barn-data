    "description": "Here's an example of solving a complex problem by synthesizing existing technologies in a novel way.A Chinese inventor known only as Mr. Feng wanted to create a robot that could persistently return tennis volleys, allowing him to practice his sport without needing to line up a human partner. While humanoid robots have made sharp advances in China, none are up to the complicated task of playing tennis.What Feng realized is that you don't need a humanoid robot; you just need a robot that can simulate the inputs and outputs of a human partner. He subsequently created this Acemate Tennis Robot, a rolling box that can track struck balls using a pair of cameras, and reach them anywhere on the court thanks to mecanum wheels. It catches the balls within its net, then fires a new ball back towards the player. By dialing in the timing of when it catches a ball and when it fires one, the effect is as if you're playing with a human.It's an understatement to say backers went wild for the idea. The Acemate has been successfully Kickstarted with over $2.1 million in pledges at press time, with 4 days left to pledge.",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/137583/When-EDC-Objects-are-Actually-Designed-by-Industrial-Designers",
    "description": "Most EDC stuff looks and feels like it was designed by an engineer or machinist. In contrast these objects by the James Brand, which was notably founded by an industrial designer (Ryan Coulter), were clearly created by folks with ID backgrounds.The anodized aluminum Warrick as a bit-holding screwdriver. Its sleek shape was designed both to slide into a coin pocket and to provide leverage. And the included bits aren't throwaway filler; those are Wiha bits. The Mehlville is a two-compartment carabiner. They're milled out of single blocks of aluminum or titanium and feature stainless steel fittings. The Palmer is a simple, minimalist aluminum utility knife. There's a hole for a lanyard and, like the Warrick, it will also fit into a coin pocket. The Palmer's elegantly-designed blade changing process is particularly brilliant, and features a patented mechanism. Here's how it works:I'm not much of an EDC guy, but all of these caught my eye. You can really tell when an industrial designer or team has spent a lot of time sweating every radii, chamfer and transition. And while it might seem like a small detail, the UX of the blade changes on the Palmer reminds me of the good that can come when industrial designers give a damn.",

    "description": "Replacing our farmhouse style decor and furniture without spending a ton of money!It's inevitable that your design preferences will change over time, and it can get really expensive to replace furniture and decor with new items.I've been experiencing that over the past few years...craving more traditional touches over some of the farmhouse design pieces I've added to our home in the past. I actually quite like many of the design aspects of farmhouse decor -- wood ceiling beams, open shelves and yes, even shiplap walls! (Fitting that we just talked about that one.)But overall I've been making an effort to transition some of our farmhouseish items to more traditional decor that will stand the test of time. I've tweaked most of these for very little money -- with equal parts patience/online stalking and DIY projects. I don't think I've ever been happier with our home! Large living room chandelier.When we built our house eight years ago, the huge \"wagon wheel\" chandeliers were all the rage.I actually did like them (and still do) -- if you have a really tall ceiling or need a large fixture, these fill up the visual space nicely without becoming overwhelming: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    Plus they put off great light! Our large round chandelier is three to four feet wide and has 12 light bulbs. (A dimmer switch is a must for this kind of light!)As much as I like the light, I see it everywhere, most often in farmhouse style decor. But I definitely didn't want to spend the money to replace it. SO, I found a simple solution that (we think) gave the light a more transitional style. I found these small black lamp shades that fit onto candelabra bulbs:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
