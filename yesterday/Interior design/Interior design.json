    "description": "Here are some of the more bizarre objects we spotted in 2024. For better or worse, everything in this category looks like it was green-lit without the input of a marketing department. Objet d'esign: A chunky brutalist keyboard. Porch piracy deterrent: A security camera that fires paintballs and tear gas. Wearable climate control: A battery-powered jacket-inflating personal cooling device. An extreme stainless steel clipboard for sketching, with built-in light. Casio designs a watch you can wear in a sauna. Casio is also releasing functional ring-sized watches. Jewelrymaker Kathryn Reid offers a range of animal snout finger rings. These gigantic, transparent horn-shaped speakers are by Ferguson Hill. A windshield for runners, to cut air resistance. These vintage lens-free road glasses. This guy prototyped a flying umbrella. A washing machine for human beings, from 1970. The Smartphone Face Shield provides in-bed emergency protection from phone-on-face drops.The see-through Securebook is a laptop designed for prisons. These bizarre snowflake-shaped charging port cleaning tools. This company specializes in infinity mirror signage. We explained what those Olympics shooting competitors wear on their faces. And seen in Germany, this Mystery-0-Mat vending machine that allegedly sells unclaimed packages.",

    "description": "Amidst a product landscape dominated by junk, we occasionally encounter humble, useful objects where the designer has clearly thought things through. These will never make it into the MoMA, but they aim to improve the lives of everyday people doing everyday things.A seat belt guide for pregnant women.Smart design improvements to the travel clothesline. The Clipa Purse Hook. A modern, three-application design for a drinking fountain. A specialty drill bit for electricians, designed from customer feedback. An easy-to-carry folding lighter that extends reach. This clever design for a kiln shed features siding that turns into shelving. A compact, easy-to-deploy design for a car sunshade (assuming this thing is real).Toilet paper storage for bathrooms with no free space. This ergonomically superior interface design for camera operators uses inertia wheels that have adjustable mass. Industrial designer Andrew Smith's brilliant fly-repelling invention.A clever design for an easy-to-store spray bottle. Klhip rethinks the ergonomics of the nail clipper. Industrial design firm BKID creates a dog harness with better UX. Microsoft's Xbox Adaptive Joystick for players with limited mobility. GE's Access Kit, which lets you easily retrofit appliances for use by the blind. Peak Design's Tech Pouch is an organizing bag with better UX. Lastly, one example of what not to do. This freezer control dial is just terrible UI design:",

    "description": "Christmas decor storage ideas and hacks that will make next year's decorating easier!I've figured out some great holiday storage solutions over the years that have helped to keep our Christmas decor better organized. These methods have made pulling out decor for the next Christmas much more efficient. These little tips save my sanity each November when the holiday decor comes out and when I put them away for the year. In general I find packing holiday decor away is faster and easier than setting it up! Am I the only one? I quite like the process, it feels cathartic to clean up the house and simplify everything for the new year. Here are my Christmas decor organization methods and a few tips I've figured out along the way!  1. Label your decor for next year My first tip is to label as much as you can -- especially the stuff you put up in the same spot every year. I've found over the years that labeling light strands I use for specific areas helps a TON!:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.  You can find my awesome label maker here! This smaller version works great too -- it's just a little more basic. Both are super easy to use.  I label any spot that uses more than one strand of lights -- both inside and outside. So when I get them out I know exactly how many bushes or trees are covered by that group of lights. I also label them inside, like the strands on our stair garland. That way I'm not trying to figure out how many I used the year before.  I use a LOT of these remote plugs and switches for our indoor lights. (That one is my favorite because I can use one remote for five items.) I store them away with the items that need a remote, like for the garland on our stairs. I just keep them plugged into the light strand.  I also keep any needed extension cords attached and stored away with the lights. If you have more than one set of these remotes, you know the joy of trying to figure out which one goes with which remote. ;) I label the matching sets so we know what goes with what: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "2024 Thrifty Decor Chick Christmas home decor tour!Is it me or did Christmas arrive a month earlier than usual? 😂 Anyone else feel like this season has FLOWN by? It must be because Thanksgiving was later this year? Whatever the reason, I'm way behind this year. I wanted to have this tour up weeks ago...but here we are! I hope you enjoy this Christmas home tour and it inspires you! I plan to put a video tour together, I'll update this when I get that up. The only space I didn't include this year is our basement family room and bar, but you can check out the basement tour from last year. I don't change up the holiday decor down there too much so it looks almost exactly this same this year. ;) BedroomLet's start in our bedroom! This room got a big makeover early this year when I installed some vertical tongue and groove molding to brighten up the space. I'm so pleased with how it came together. I like to add a few Christmas touches in our room every year, like our flocked, snowy tree: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    This year I did all silver and white ornaments on that tree, but didn't hang them everywhere. I kind of cascaded them around the tree, in a band of ornaments. It's just a different look and I really like how it turned out! I draped some of my favorite Norfolk greenery on our standing mirror: It needed a little something, so I made my own bell garland with some green floral wire and these tiny brass bells:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it). Quick note: The “Under $12.99” list isn’t the only one with items priced that low – for example, there are also two gifts under $12.99 on the kids list.

We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it. I won’t recap our entire decision to downsize (you can see the full explanation here) but the highlights are: We used to live in a 3,150 sq. ft. home in suburban Richmond, Virginia Now we live in a 1,400 sq.
