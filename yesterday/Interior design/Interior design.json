    "description": "This portable Erika 85 table saw, by German manufacturer Mafell, has a number of tricks up its sleeve. First off, it's designed to be easy for one person to set up:One of the feet has an instant height-adjustment feature, making uneven floors quickly dealt with:And while you can push material through the saw, the conventional way……it also performs this magic trick:When crosscutting or cutting miters, rather than pushing the workpiece on a sled, you hold the piece stationary and the saw slides towards you. The company reckons this is easier and more precise than doing it the other way around. It's also easier than sliding chunky workpieces towards the saw:Lastly, a simple but desirable feature. The saw has a built-in light that illuminates exactly where you want to see:I think the pull feature would take some getting used to, because I've never seen a table saw that had this feature. But that's because I'm based in the 'States. Mafell has been producing this design for a whopping 40 years.",

    "description": "Touchscreens were really cool 15 years ago, when the iPad first came out. Now that the novelty's worn off, more people seem to realize that navigating submenus sucks. Manufacturers, particularly automotive ones, love touchscreens because it reduces their production costs. But the user experience suffers for it, and leaves many craving physical knobs, buttons, dials and switches.A Bulgarian company called Enhance manufactures an aftermarket knob for the Tesla. In keeping with the puerility of the target market, it's called the S3XY Knob. The retrofittable knob, which comes in a housing flanked with four programmable buttons, communicates with the car via Bluetooth and Tesla's API. It's mounted in the center console and allows drivers to access the climate control, media playback, drive modes and more without needing to fuss with the touchscreen. Visual feedback comes via a small circular screen atop the knob.Here's a demo of what it can do:The company also makes standalone S3XY Buttons for Teslas that are user-programmable. They come with stickers of various functions. The knobs run about $450, and buy-in for the buttons starts at $330 for a four-pack.The question is whether these objects will proliferate, or if manufacturers will listen to customer feedback and give people the kinds of controls they actually like.",

    "description": "When patience pays off! My amazing second hand dining table find.   I shared my new obsession love for Facebook Marketplace (and a few helpful shopping tips) a few months ago. I've discovered so many beautiful and unique finds for our home at a great price! I love this method of shopping because I can browse at my leisure (usually right before bed 😂), or if we're looking for something very specific, it allows me to \"save\" a search for specific keywords and/or set up alerts to notify me of new listings.  There was one big item I'd been looking into for some time. I've looked here and there for years, but more recently the hunt started when I painted this cane buffet table earlier this year:  It turned into a pain of a project, but it was all worth it -- we LOVE the end result. That warm wine color is so lovely!   But as often happens, one little change created an itch to make another one. We've had our dining table for seven years and I loved the wood top:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

I've been dreaming up ways I could change out the metal legs, but never moved forward with it because the planked wood top was what really didn't fit in.  Plus, it was starting to drive. us. crazy. that we couldn't push the upholstered chairs at the ends all the way in.  As time passed, I was envisioning a more traditional table in this space. It would be nice to have something larger as well.  The dining room is part of our open concept living area. It was labeled as a \"morning room\" on our plans and is full of windows and natural light.  It's not a traditional, stuffy dining room, but I was craving a little bit of a traditional style in there. Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How to build a shelf to hide the washer and dryer components.  This easy DIY shelf will hide the ugly washer and dryer components, but also gives you plenty of additional storage for laundry needs.  This is the second time I've added a DIY shelf unit behind our top loader washer and dryer -- I love them!   This shelf project was one of MANY in our mud room/laundry combo makeover. I tackled so many DIYs, from customizing a set of base cabinets to tiling the backsplash and finally adding beautiful floral wallpaper.  This washer and dryer shelf was something I was really missing in our current laundry area. As a reminder, this is what we had when we moved in:  Not bad at all! But the cabinets were hung at a height that were better suited for front loaders -- there was no room underneath to put a shelf, but it was difficult to reach over the washer and dryer and access the cabinets.  **I get a lot of questions about that tray under the washer -- it catches small leaks. It was cracked so we ended up removing it. (I now use a Govee water sensor next to the washer.) Part of my big plan for this space was to move those cabinets over to another wall in here, with drawer cabinets underneath. This was a great decision, it made the flow of the room work so much better.  That created space for the shelf above the washer and dryer. You can see how I built this shelf to hide the ugly stuff behind the washer and dryer at our old house: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   It gave us better access to things we reach for most.  I built this one a little differently so I could add some more storage space.
