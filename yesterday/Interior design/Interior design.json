    "description": "When crafting objects or structures out of real wood, knots are part of the aesthetic. But particularly demanding clients might find them objectionable. Enter this Knot Remover kit, from Japanese tool manufacturer Star-M. First you drill the knot out with the tapered bit. Then you attach this thing, which is essentially a giant pencil sharpener, to your drill.You select a dowel of the appropriate size and go at it.Pound the dowel in with glue, flush-cut it, and you're good to go. (No idea why they don't include a shot of the completed process.)",

    "description": "Payphones \"were the only things that were built to last for decades and be out in the elements,\" says electrical engineer Patrick Schlott. He should know; as a hobby, he buys secondhand payphones, rewires them, then asks local businesses in rural Vermont if they'd let him install them. His goal is to offer, for free, public telephone service. (Schlott foots the bill himself.) \"It's assumed most folks own cell phones,\" writes Schlott. \"Well, not everyone does, sometimes they don't work out on dirt roads, sometimes you forget your charger, and sometimes you just really need to make a phone call. We aim to provide a valuable public service to the community while teaching people about the US telephone system that has over a century of history behind it.\" Schlott's company, RandTel, currently operates three phones in his neck of Vermont: One at the North Tunbridge General Store in Tunbridge, one at the Latham Library and a third—a rotary model from the 1950s--at the town of Randolph's information booth. He's particularly proud of that last one, as \"This installation is 100% solar-powered, provided graciously by Catamount Solar,\" he writes. \"Many thanks to the White River Valley Chamber of Commerce for hosting!\" Here's a look at what Schlott does:",

But every once and awhile I open my recipe binder (it creaks and a cloud of dust poofs out) and find one I love and I just have to share. You will thank me for this one! :) I’ve made this “pie” for years, but for some reason it’s been a while since I last did. And now that we’ve had it again, I’m quite sure I’ll be making it weekly. Or so. It’s SO easy. And insanely good. You will LOVE it. That is, if you like peanut butter. Or chocolate. Or sugar. This peanut butter pie is a great recipe for the warmer months, because there's no oven needed! But it's also a staple for a holiday meal.
