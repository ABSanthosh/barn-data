    "description": "Enzo Mari introduced his Autoprogettazione movement back in 1974, encouraging DIY furniture making. Today, five decades later, German company 1x1 Systems continues the movement with a digital twist, providing 3D print files for objects you can assemble and complete yourself.This Delta Lamp, by German industrial designer Christoph Hauf, is one of 1x1's offerings. It's a series of customizable connectors and a lampshade. Joined with a standard light bulb socket and a dowel, it becomes a wall lamp. The user-determined length of the dowel determines the standoff distance from the wall. \"Delta is a material-efficient wall lamp based around a simple wooden stick that can be easily upcycled from old broomsticks or discarded furniture. The design is highly adjustable both in height and angle while always staying in place thanks to the constant tension of the cable.\"\"The lower wall mount consists of two parts through which the cable runs, allowing the lamp to swing across the room while staying perfectly aligned. The double-walled lampshade is also 3D-printed and includes a thread to fit E14 light sockets.\"\"This is our most complex parametric design to date; both cable guides and lampshade adjust to match any width of the used stick as well as the total dimensions of the lamp.\"\"Delta Lamp costs €30 and includes custom print files based on your configuration, as well as a custom manual. It is available via 1x1.systems and can be previewed in AR via your phone.\" See Also:1x1 Systems' Axon Connector",

    "description": "Industrial designer and innovation leader Kevin Bethune, the founder and Chief Creative Office of design think-tank dreams • design + life, has written a new book. His first, \"Reimagining Design: Unlocking Strategic Innovation,\" explored the strategic values of design beyond aesthetics. The follow-up, \"Nonlinear: Navigating Design with Curiosity and Conviction,\" challenges linear approaches to design, arguing that the complexities of today's world demand new levels of openness and adaptability. \"In Nonlinear, Kevin Bethune shows us that we can reject trodden paths of digital or physical product creation by taking advantage of a nonlinear approach. To unlock meaningful innovation that breeds new and novel outcomes, he writes, teams need to embark on a journey into the proverbial forest of ambiguity, the result of a rapidly converging, dynamic, and exponentially changing landscape. The journey is less about getting it right or wrong, and more about using the information we have at our disposal to understand our choices and take steps to unlock new learning.\" \"Nonlinear begins by taking the reader through Bethune's professional 'zigs and zags.' The author explains that while his interdisciplinary leaps were rare at the time he took them, these varied experiences unlocked perspectives about design and innovation that uniquely prepared him for our present moment and for the future. He then showcases the role of quantitative information to strategically frame and set boundary conditions for our creative exploration, and the role of qualitative insights to provide the substance necessary to begin crafting solutions that address unmet needs.\" \"The book also identifies accelerants (or flywheels) that will help readers as they reflect on their journey navigating the forest of ambiguity, with a specific emphasis on diversity, a key theme for Bethune, a Black man who has navigated new horizons. Readers will enjoy having the chance to customize the author's perspectives and make them their own at both an individual and team level.\" The book is available here, and Design Better is hosting an AMA with Bethune on March 11th. You can sign up here.",

    "description": "When SAY Architecture’s clients moved from Tasmania to Melbourne, they wanted to bring their love of the outdoors into their new inner-city weatherboard cottage. In a considered renovation of their Collingwood home, the period residence has been reinvented with a bold, barn-like extension featuring raw, honest materials — strictly no plasterboard was allowed. Exposed brick and timber-lined interiors give the house a warm mid-century inspired character, while the small floorplan dedicates more space to the newly planted backyard.",

They were eager to extend the life of the old elegant home, which had been neglected after years as a rental property. It took a few years to realise their vision, but now the character of Dragon Tree Terrace has been sensitively restored and updated, with a sleek brick addition hidden at the rear.",

    "description": "My tips for finding beautiful treasures on Facebook Marketplace! If you love vintage and unique decor in your home, then the Facebook Marketplace will become your favorite source for interesting pieces!  Recently, especially over the past year or so, the seasonal decor releases at places like Target and Walmart are just hitting me differently.  It's hard to find something unique -- all of the decor items start to look the same after a while.  Over the past few years I've fallen back in love with thrifting and antiquing. It helps that our teenage son enjoys it too -- he loves looking for vintage sports memorabilia.  Late last year I clicked on the little marketplace button at the bottom of my FB page while winding down in bed one night. I was surprised at all of the beautiful pieces that were both interesting and full of character.  I started logging in everyday to check out the finds. It's easy to get slightly addicted once you find a few treasures!  In the past few months I've learned a lot about successfully shopping on this app, so figured I would share my tips along with some of my finds! 1. Search for keywords and add filters. Looking through all of the listings can become a major time suck, so searching by terms helps to whittle down the items.  You can use any word you'd like -- wood or metal, new or used. Or search a specific design style you love like modern or farmhouse. Not only can you use keywords, but you can set a price range, condition, color and more to filter your search: I love just about anything brass, so I use that every so often to look for treasures. These brass library bookends were one of my first finds: Love the candlestick in front of the books!  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.
