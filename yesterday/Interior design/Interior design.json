    "description": "As we saw with their new drill, in recent years Dremel has rolled out a line of innovative power tools. The industrial design firm behind this new generation of stepped-up tools is Michigan-based Sundberg Ferar. Repositioning Dremel: Evolving a Heritage Brand for the Next GenerationDremel, renowned for inventing the high-speed rotary tool, has long been a leader in precision and craftsmanship. As the brand expands into mainstream power tool categories—such as drills, circular saws, and oscillating tools—they sought to evolve their identity to connect with a younger, more diverse, and entry-level skilled audience.Sundberg Ferar partnered with Dremel to develop a fresh Visual Brand Language (VBL) and design a new family of power tools tailored for this emerging consumer base. With an urgent market need following the COVID-19 lockdown, the project was executed on an aggressive timeline to bring innovative, accessible solutions to market quickly. How Do You Reimagine a Heritage Brand for a New Generation—at Lightning Speed?Sundberg Ferar, known for its expertise in product design and innovation, excels at creating strategic, user-focused solutions that seamlessly blend aesthetics, functionality, and market relevance. Approaching the Dremel project, SF leveraged its deep expertise in Visual Brand Language (VBL) development and consumer insights to craft a fresh design language that would resonate with a younger, more diverse audience. Balancing brand heritage with modern expectations, SF executed a fast-paced, highly efficient process to ensure the new power tools met both Dremel's legacy of precision and the urgent market demand for innovative, accessible products. \"Dremel's Genius New Drill Is the Most Compelling 12V Power Tool I've Seen in Years\". --Ben Bowers, Chief content officer and co-founder of Gear PatrolHuman ImpactPower tools have traditionally been designed with skilled DIYers and professional contractors in mind, often favoring an aggressive, highly masculine aesthetic that can feel intimidating to entry-level users. Sundberg Ferar's approach for Dremel prioritized accessibility, ensuring that the new tool range was more manageable in scale and featured intuitive, usability-focused design elements. By lowering the barrier to entry, these tools empower new users to build confidence, develop hands-on skills, and experience the satisfaction of creating with precision and ease. Business ImpactThis new product line positions Dremel to capture untapped market potential by addressing a growing segment of consumers eager to develop DIY skills but hesitant to engage with traditionally aggressive, professional-grade tools. By identifying and responding to the needs of novice and casual users, Dremel is strategically expanding its reach beyond experienced craftsmen and tradespeople, tapping into a broader audience that includes hobbyists, crafters, and homeowners looking for approachable tools. Through its collaboration with Sundberg Ferar, Dremel has successfully introduced a product line centered around usability, accessibility, and confidence-building, carving out a unique white space in the power tool category. These thoughtfully designed tools empower new users by reducing intimidation factors commonly associated with high-powered professional equipment, ultimately encouraging more people to explore DIY projects with ease and enjoyment. This strategic shift not only reinforces Dremel's legacy of innovation and user-friendly design but also serves as a catalyst for long-term customer engagement. By making DIY more approachable, the brand is fostering stronger consumer loyalty, ensuring that first-time users remain within the Dremel ecosystem as they advance their skills. Additionally, this move creates opportunities for future product line extensions, allowing Dremel to continue expanding its portfolio within the entry-level power tool market. By establishing itself as the go-to brand for accessible, high-quality tools, Dremel is well-positioned to drive sustained growth, increase market penetration, and strengthen its competitive edge in the industry.

But we soon realized how much we LOVE having a covered patio. When we moved in, we placed our outdoor table and chairs out there, but we learned pretty quickly that we prefer to lounge in comfy chairs. :)I sold our outdoor table and replaced it with our chairs that used to sit near our outdoor fireplace. This was how it looked soon after moving in:    It's around 200 square feet, which we've realized is a perfectly lovely size for conversations with a small group of friends.  You know how I love symmetry!
