    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/136933/An-Industrial-Design-Classic-The-Brionvega-Algol-TV",
    "description": "This Algol TV was designed by Italian architect/designer Marco Zanuso and German industrial designer Richard Sapper. Released by Italian electronics brand Brionvega in 1964, the ABS-clad TV was described by Zanuso as \"a little dog that looks up at its master.\"The design was popular, landing in both the MoMA and the V\u0026A Museum in London, and was reissued multiple times—all the way until 1998! A 34-year lifespan for a television set—an 11\" model, no less—seems insane today.A '90s marketing image It admittedly doesn't look fantastic with the handle deployed, though you wouldn't see that during ordinary use. Handle aside, Zanuso and Sapper really pulled off the canted form while retaining a pleasing proportion and gesture. To see how this effect can go really wrong, have a look at the back end of the unloved 1985 Alfa Romeo Milano. See Also:Two Fun 1960s/'70s Television Sets Designed by Rodolfo Bonetto",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/136931/From-Latvia-Kanttaris-Bronze-Bar-Cabinet",
    "description": "From a design perspective, Latvia is in an interesting geographic position. In addition to having a local tradition of craftsmanship, the Baltic state has been touched by Scandinavian influences from its west and Soviet-era Modernism (which to me always had a paradoxical touch of gaudiness) from its east. We have yet to see a distinct Latvian design aesthetic emerging on the world stage, but this Bar Cabinet Eclipse from Riga-based furniture brand Kanttari is certainly eye-catching. Aimed at the luxury market, the cabinet is finished in bronze that has been sanded in two directions. The interior is walnut-veneered, the drawers felt-lined, the counter marble. There is a bit of showiness in both the dual bi-level carousels and the elaborate tracks for hanging the glassware, but the LED lighting is at least subdued. The €22,000 (USD $24,724) asking price is high for us mere mortals, but is really at the lower end of the luxury market; something similar from say, Italy would be a multiple of that figure. But the Eclipse has gained international attention, having scored an A' Design Award, and other luxury manufacturers in the market have surely taken note.",

    "description": "Over the last two years, we’ve been visiting homes around Victoria with home comfort and energy advisor Tim Forcey to find out how the owners can improve their property’s energy efficiency. This normally looks like getting off gas, switching to efficient electric appliances, and upgrading your home’s insulation. But when you’re a renter, taking control of your energy bills is a little more difficult. Below, we step inside a renovated Edwardian rental that’s shared by four friends in Northcote, to hear some more renter-friendly tips that could help make an impact on their comfort and energy consumption.",

    "description": "How to build a shelf to hide the washer and dryer components.  This easy DIY shelf will hide the ugly washer and dryer components, but also gives you plenty of additional storage for laundry needs.  This is the second time I've added a DIY shelf unit behind our top loader washer and dryer -- I love them!   This shelf project was one of MANY in our mud room/laundry combo makeover. I tackled so many DIYs, from customizing a set of base cabinets to tiling the backsplash and finally adding beautiful floral wallpaper.  This washer and dryer shelf was something I was really missing in our current laundry area. As a reminder, this is what we had when we moved in:  Not bad at all! But the cabinets were hung at a height that were better suited for front loaders -- there was no room underneath to put a shelf, but it was difficult to reach over the washer and dryer and access the cabinets.  **I get a lot of questions about that tray under the washer -- it catches small leaks. It was cracked so we ended up removing it. (I now use a Govee water sensor next to the washer.) Part of my big plan for this space was to move those cabinets over to another wall in here, with drawer cabinets underneath. This was a great decision, it made the flow of the room work so much better.  That created space for the shelf above the washer and dryer. You can see how I built this shelf to hide the ugly stuff behind the washer and dryer at our old house: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

I started by figuring out the middle spot between the two machines. I hung a piece of scrap wood and drilled it into studs:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How to stain a fiberglass entry door in a rich wood color.  One of the most common questions I get is about the stain we used on our wood front door. Turns out our door isn't wood, but it is stained to look like it.  Did you know you can stain a fiberglass door and it will look just like wood? I didn't realize this until we built our current house. I had no idea you could use stain on anything but wood, and I've been at this DIY thing for a long time! We have a Therma Tru door set with sidelites (see specifics of our indoor and outdoor home finishes here) and picked the stain color called English Walnut.  Our front door doesn't get much of the elements because it's protected on our front porch. But even without the wind and rain hitting it directly, the dark stain was still super faded nearly eight years later.  I'm prepping for our son's high school graduation party, and this DIY project was on my list! The process wasn't nearly as difficult as I thought it would be. There are only a few simple steps in this application, they just take some time. The before photos of the door finish didn't look as horrible as in real life, but it was faded, worn out and chipping in some spots: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   Our builder didn't do a great job the first time this door was stained, so we had a lot of areas (particularly in more detailed spots) that were chipping away completely:  The builder left some of the leftover product, so I was able to look it up online and order more stain.  I went with the dark, rich English Walnut again in this same-day stain: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
