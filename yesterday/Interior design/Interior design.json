    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/134530/Hyundai-and-Kias-User-Friendly-Upper-Body-Exoskeleton",
    "description": "Hyundai Motor and Kia Robotics LAB have designed the X-ble Shoulder, an upper-body exoskeleton designed for those doing overhead work. The design was heavily informed by user research, by interviewing over 300 production line workers at Hyundai's manufacturing facilities. The designers first focused on two things: Creating a device that would not only assist with efficiency by increasing a worker's applicable strength, but would also reduce musculoskeletal injuries. They furthered tailored the design by incorporating test user feedback: Workers wanted it to be comfortable, so that they wouldn't have to take it off every time they went on break; they wanted it to be easy to put on by themselves; they wanted it to be lightweight; they wanted it to easily fit over existing uniforms; they wanted it to be easy to clean.The resultant design uses springs and mechanical advantage rather than motors; the units are unpowered and do not require charging. The system consists of a soft vest and hard components that can easily be decoupled from the vest, for ease of cleaning. A worker can don the system in 20 seconds by themselves, using easily understandable interfaces like a zipper, clips and straps. And the device reduces shoulder load by up to 60% and anterior/lateral deltoid muscle strain by up to 30 percent. Made from both metal and carbon composites, the X-ble Shoulder is strong but lightweight, tipping the scales at just 1.9kg (4.2 lbs). The system was designed specifically for Hyundai's factory line workers, who will start receiving the units next year. However, the design is promising enough that they're planning to commercialize the design overseas by 2026, so it should be coming to the North American and European markets.In the following interviews with the designers, you can see how crucial the user feedback was to the development process. If only all designers were this thorough, in interviewing test users!",

    "description": "Believe it or not, this orange thing… …is actually a bicycle frame. This wild-looking RCYL bike, by German plastics manufacturer Igus, is made primarily out of plastic and recycled plastic. The frame and fork, which are entirely plastic, are made from 50% recycled fishing nets. The company is billing it as a highly sustainable alternative to regular bicycles, and will take the bike back at the end of its life in order to recycle it into a new bike. It weighs 17kg (37.5 lbs), and the manufacturer bills it as a low-maintenance ride:\"Lightweight and lubrication-free high-performance plastics from Igus are used everywhere on the bicycle – from ball bearings in the wheel to bearings in the brake levers and pedals. All components have integrated solid lubricants and ensure low-friction dry running – without a single drop of lubricating oil.\" \"Owners can leave the bike outdoors in all weathers without hesitation and clean it in seconds with a garden hose. The bike, which is suitable for everyday use, does not rust and is virtually maintenance-free.\" It's said to be particularly well-suited for salty seaside climes, as corrosion is not an issue. The bike is available for order in Europe, and goes for €1,243 (USD $1,315). If you return the bike to them for recycling, they'll give you a €50 (USD $53) credit towards the purchase of a new bike.",

    "link": "https://www.thriftydecorchick.com/2020/12/fluffy-yarn-Christmas.html",
    "description": "How to make the cutest and (fluffiest!) yarn wrapped Christmas tree decor.  This is one of my easiest holiday DIYs yet! These Styrofoam yarn trees can be changed up with any material you'd like to use.  I wanted some new holiday decor for our basement but didn't want to spend a ton of money -- I came up with this idea and they turned out better than I imagined. At first I was going to use basic yarn on Styrofoam cones, but wanted a fluffier look.  Enter this finger knit yarn I've had forever -- for the blanket I still haven't made yet, ha!:  It is SO so soft and fluffy and I had an idea -- I wondered how it would work wound around the cones instead of regular yarn. Well, I'll tell you...it worked ADORABLE. 😁 This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   These DIY yarn Christmas trees are quick to make with just a few easy steps. I started with basic craft foam forms:  I got my soft looped yarn and foam cones from Michael's.  And used my hot glue gun to attach the yard at the bottom of the cone first:  I started the first line of yarn about an inch from the bottom because this yarn drapes so much.  I went up about 3/4 inch to an inch each pass around the cone:  Just do a bead of hot glue and then lightly press the top portion of the yarn along the glue.  I just kept wrapping...this was a great mindless craft to do while watching TV. They go together fast:  When I got to the top of the very top of the cone, I cut just enough excess yarn and then wrapped it up on the very tip with hot glue. This finger knit looped stuff is very forgiving! I did three different sizes -- one was about six inches, one was 11 inches and the final was about 17 inches but I cut those two down a bit: I used one skein of yarn for all the trees and had a bit leftover. It's like a snowy, fluffy forest! :) I think they are the cutest. You don't even have to do anything to cover the white foam -- it disappears behind the yarn:  I giggled every time I finished one. They are adorable and SO easy and inexpensive! The foam products are often on sale, or you can use a coupon at one of the craft stores. I added some of the fairy lights I showed you here for a bit of twinkle:  You can also have them glow from \"inside\" by running those tiny lights under the yarn around the tree:  You can dress this Christmas tree craft up in so many ways! Add a pop of color by sticking in red beads here and there to look like berries.Use embellishments like these adorable tiny plaid bows, mini pine cones or holly berry leaves throughout the trees. (I may have to add those bows!)This would be a REALLY cute idea for a kid's room in a variety of bright colorful yarns. Stick a small dowel rod into the top with a star or angel glued on for a finishing touch. Pom poms glued all around or attached with pins would be adorable as well! I wanted something simple but fun on this table in our basement and these were perfect!I went super cozy and a bit rustic with the decor down there, so they fit right in:  See more about our Disney prints here! I love our \"snowy\" fluffy trees! I think they may have to go on the mantel next year instead. :)I used the Bernat brand finger knit yarn in cream (here are all the colors they offer!) but the cream seems hard to find right now.  You can pin this craft for later using this image:  Now I'm off to make a scarf with the remaining yarn I have! ;) If you have extra foam cones laying around when you're done, try my Santa hat cone craft: Check out a bunch of my favorite, easy Christmas crafts here!  See more of our home and shop items in each room here.Never miss a post by signing up to get posts via email.  This content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

I love seeing pics of friends and family with their hot coffee and comfy clothes out finding the deals.  WAY back in the day I would wake up early to shop, but those days are long gone! Now it would take an act of God to get me up super early the day after Thanksgiving, ha! If you're like me and prefer to shop from your computer instead of trekking all over, this is for you! This post is so fun to pull together every year -- check out my ten themed gift ideas from last year. I added ** two asterisks ** before each item that is an Amazon Black Friday Deal! Beauty finds Let's start with a bit of beauty, specifically nails! I prefer to do my own -- I used to get gel or dip nails before a vacation or big event, but it's rare that I do that anymore.  I've found a few items that make my nails look great and thought I would share them.  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   Do you use a nail buffer?

The updated home takes advantage of its prominent corner site, introducing a translucent glass wall that subtly engages with the street, while maintaining the occupants’ security and privacy. A sheltered internal courtyard injects additional natural light into the home, and separates the new garage and parent’s retreat above from the living spaces. See more below!",

    "description": "Just like we did for our 2023 Gift Guides and our 2022 Gift Guides, we’ve got all three of our gift lists in one singular post right here. So let’s dive right into the 3 categories that we cover each year: Gift Ideas for Grown-Ups Gift Ideas for Kids Gift Ideas Under $12.99 Every year that we make these, we love including actual things that we own and enjoy, as well as things that we’re buying for others (like our own kids, each other, and relatives/friends). Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it). Quick note: The “Under $12.99” list isn’t the only one with items priced that low – for example, there are also two gifts under $12.99 on the kids list.

    "description": "In November of 2020, we published a post called “What’s It Like To Downsize” after living in our smaller home for 6 months. We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it. I won’t recap our entire decision to downsize (you can see the full explanation here) but the highlights are: We used to live in a 3,150 sq. ft. home in suburban Richmond, Virginia Now we live in a 1,400 sq.
