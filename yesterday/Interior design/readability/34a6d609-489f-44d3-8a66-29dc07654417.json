  "text": "vondom reveals africa sofa designed by eugeni quitlletVondom and Eugeni Quitllet return to elemental design, expanding the Africa collection with a generously proportioned sofa that doesn’t demand attention. It simply exists with quiet confidence, as if it had always belonged. Designed to cradle both body and space, the Africa sofa carries the ease of simplicity and the depth of an object shaped by time. Outdoor living, in this context, becomes something softer, more reflective, and more enduring.Vondom and Eugeni Quitllet collaborate to expand the Africa collection | all images courtesy of Vondomafrica sofa expands the collection with sustainable comfort Founded with a mission to create bold and intelligent outdoor furniture, Vondom is no stranger to sculptural design that dares to defy conventional expectations. With roots in Valencia, the company has developed a distinctive language, one that favors bold silhouettes, refined materials, and a conscious approach to outdoor living. In collaboration with Catalan designer Eugeni Quitllet, Vondom has cultivated a body of work that is both future-facing and deeply grounded in timeless forms. The Africa collection, born from their first chair together, remains a central thread in this shared story.What started as a simple armless chair has grown into a lineage: barstools, loungers, cushioned dining seats—and now, the Africa sofa. Offered in two- and three-seater configurations, the piece translates the clean silhouette of the original chair into a plush, lounge-worthy form. It’s a natural evolution, not just in function but in spirit—one that invites you to sit longer, share more, and still feel the quiet elegance of minimalist design.offered in two- and three-seater configurations, the Africa sofa translates the clean silhouette of the original chair into a plush, lounge-worthy formhow do you simplify without compromising?Each new Africa creation begins with a question: how do you simplify without compromising? The answer is found in the use of monobloc injection molding, allowing Vondom to achieve optimal ergonomics, lightweight durability, and stackability—all wrapped in a silhouette that feels almost effortless. The sofa continues this approach, bringing the brand’s indoor-level comfort to the outdoors, with high-quality upholstery that resists the elements yet remains soft to the touch.There’s a sense of fashion here too, not in the fleeting, trend-chasing sense, but in the way each sofa is ‘dressed’ for occasion. Its upholstered finish, available in a range of textiles, lets it adapt to changing tastes and moods without losing the identity of the collection, giving its modular minimalism a tailored twist.the sofa brings the brand’s indoor-level comfort to the outdoors with high-quality upholsteryBut beyond the aesthetics and engineering lies a deeper intention: longevity. For Quitllet, true beauty is in endurance. A product should weather storms, saltwater splashes, and sun-soaked summers without losing grace. It’s sustainability not as a buzzword, but as a design philosophy – a product you can live with, and live in, for a lifetime.The Africa sofa doesn’t just extend a collection – it continues a conversation between designer and material, between brand and lifestyle, between past and future. And in that dialogue, Vondom reminds us that design is not always about creating something new; sometimes, it’s about perfecting the essence of what already works.the monobloc injection molding, allows Vondom to achieve optimal ergonomics for its productsthe upholstered finish, available in a range of textiles, lets it adapt to changing tastes and moods without losing the identity of the collectionproject info:name: Africacompany: Vondom | @vondomsludesign: Eugeni Quitllet | @eugeniquitllet",
