By repurposing coffee waste into a composite dubbed Coffee Dough, the series experiments with texture and form.The furniture pieces are constructed using a mold, where Coffee Dough—a mixture of coffee grounds and binding agents—is poured over a cardboard frame. Once dried, the material exhibits a texture akin to ceramic or stone, with variations in color and surface cracking depending on the mixing ratio.Unsleepy Chair 01 | all images courtesy of CHanhyeok KimThe furniture mimics the texture of fermented soy blocksThe series by the Korean carpenter CHanhyeok Kim includes four chairs and two stools. Unsleepy Chair 01 embodies the raw texture of Coffee Dough, while Unsleepy Chair 02 embraces a ‘Meju’ texture, inspired by the split surfaces of traditional fermented soybean blocks. The cracks, a natural result of the drying process, are intentionally emphasized to highlight the organic nature of the material. The Unsleepy Series continues to evolve, transforming through subtle shifts in structure. The first chair reconfigures itself—flipping upside down and shedding its legs—to explore new spatial and functional possibilities. Through these experimental techniques, Kim pushes the boundaries of sustainable materiality, redefining furniture design with unexpected elements.CHanhyeok Kim explores material hybridity with his Unsleepy Series | Unsleepy Chair 02the collection is crafted from coffee grounds and architectural materials | back of Unsleepy Chair 02the series experiments with texture and form | Unsleepy Chair 03, CHippendale A5, CHippendale A6",
