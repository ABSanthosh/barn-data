  "description": "By simply altering the existing floorplan of their pre-1900s cottage in Paddington, Queensland, partners and co-directors of Hall and Roberts Studio, Elizabeth Hall and Ruairi Roberts, have managed to preserve its period charm and maximise space — without extending. Returned to its former glory, the character-filled home proudly exemplifies what can be achieved with ‘unloved old housing stock’. See their clever renovation below.",

  "text": "For Ruairi Roberts and Elizabeth Hall, co-directors of Hall and Roberts Studio, the purpose of their pre-1900s Queensland cottage renovation was more than simply updating their standard of living. ‘We hope to prove through this project that the small and rundown housing stock isn’t a wasted investment, and they have endless potential,’ explains Ruairi. ‘These houses often get overlooked, knocked down and replaced with oversized echo chambers to the detriment of our neighbourhood’s character.’ In addition, this compact renovation stands as an example of how a small footprint can be cleverly maximised within the constraints of old structures, without sacrificing comfort. ‘By reviving these smaller footprints with a few modern improvements, they can be given a new lease of life to last another hundred years’, says Ruairi. ‘Whilst cost is a big part of this equation, it is not the only factor. The less we do, yes the cheaper it costs, but it also costs less on the environment.’ ‘This project highlights how altering an existing footprint can result in innovative solutions that meet our modern living standards.’ Sometimes, it can be as simple as working with natural light. Which is exactly what the couple did to maximise space — or the illusion of space — when they removed the deck and low tin roof at the rear of the house, and in its place inserted a large sliding door and Juliette balcony. ‘The natural light this immediately introduced was critical to the success of the new layout,’ says Elizabeth. The living and kitchen zones were then flipped from their original locations, in order for the kitchen to connect to the balcony and the sunken courtyard beyond, rather than facing inward. This also resulted in giving Ruairi and Elizabeth a little more privacy from their neighbours. A dedicated dining zone was forfeited in favour of a more spacious kitchen, and an oversized concrete island bench was installed to serve the dual purpose of dining table and kitchen workspace. Colour and materials add to the illusion of space, with Ruairi and Elizabeth swapping out the existing pale purple, burgundy and light blue (‘a very ‘90s palette’) for a refreshed look of Dulux Whisper White (internally and externally), Dulux Mildura (on the window hoods and front door) and Dulux Black (covering the base of the house). Outside, the pair have also introduced new landscaping to complement the updated home. ‘We were fortunate that the existing house was located closer to the front boundary, so when the the rear deck was removed, a generous space was revealed that made way for the sunken courtyard,’ explains Elizabeth. Now surrounded by subtropical plants, the inviting space just outside the kitchen window feels like a lush sanctuary – whilst at the front, the pair’s hard work is visible for the whole street to enjoy. ‘By embracing a more open boundary, naturally our connection to our community has flourished through daily interactions with those around us, bringing joyful moments into our everyday,’ says Elizabeth.",
