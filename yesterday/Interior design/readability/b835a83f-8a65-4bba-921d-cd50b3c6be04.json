  "description": "You could be ‘anywhere’ when stepping inside this Bondi apartment — the impact of recent renovation by Brad Swartz Architects that draws on Brazilian, Scandinavian, Japanese, and local influences. The architects recently transformed the 52-square-metre apartment, turning its simple interior palette with bulky joinery into a textured and refined space tailored to the life of its owner. Clever features such as an operable stainless steel dining table cantilevering off the island bench maximise space to support a more spacious and calm existence.",

  "text": "This compact apartment by Brad Swartz Architects prioritises quality over quantity to support efficient and stylish small footprint living. When the architects were brought onto the project, the apartment interior consisted of little more than white walls and bulky kitchen journey that overpowered the 52-square-metre apartment. The client was seeking a more sophisticated and open space, taking better advantage of its north and western light. ‘Opening up the kitchen and reconfiguring the bathroom was a must,’ says Brad Swartz. The rest was about maximising the space and adding some character and texture back into the apartment.’ The architects removed an existing wall between the kitchen and living room, and designed an operable stainless steel surface that cantilevers off the island. This bench can be pulled out to be used as desired to function as a desk, dining table, or extra prep space when cooking. ‘We worked closely with the joiner, Ethan James and Co, on this and the design process ended up more akin to that when designing furniture than interior joinery,’ says Brad. ‘The result is an island that feels more like an operable sculpture than part of a kitchen.’ This bench is among several architectural manoeuvres that maximise space in the small home. ‘Other subtle moves include the kitchen’s open working display/storage shelf in lieu of overhead cupboards, which helps the space feel wider, and the kitchen feel less like a “kitchen,” says Brad. Door openings were made full height to further increase the sense of space and visual flow between the living and main bedroom. The bathroom was also reconfigured in the renovation to make way for a custom Japanese-style shower/bath against the wall. The new material palette draws on the robustness of Brazilian modernism, and the minimalism of Scandinavian design, in the use of travertine, mosaic tiles, stainless steel and pale oak. ‘They gently combine to create a robust yet warm palette in the space,’ says Brad. The bathroom was treated a little differently, introducing two tones of handmade Moroccan tiles. ‘A clear glazing expressing the terracotta colour on the floor helps create an earthy and “outdoors” feel in the bathroom,’ says Brad. ‘The white glazing from the bath up, along with the pivot windows, helps light bounce around the small room.’ Brad hopes the finished product feels like an oasis away from the owner’s busy working life and the Bondi streets outside. ‘Somewhere you can relax and unwind… to me that’s what this home feels like.’",
