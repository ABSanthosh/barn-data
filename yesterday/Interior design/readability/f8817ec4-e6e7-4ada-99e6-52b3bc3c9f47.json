  "description": "In case you missed it last year, retro motels and hotels are having a resurgence, and a new one has just opened its doors on the NSW South Coast. A block of old, run-down holiday apartments built in the 1980s has been transformed into Casita: a boutique motel, where every suite inside functions like a ‘little house’.",

  "text": "Casita is a new retro motel that’s been recently redesigned just in time for summer. It’s the second accommodation by the clever team behind The Isla, another restored motel in Batehaven, which opened in 2022. Yanna Dascarolis (of Clay Interiors) is among the group of ‘lifelong friends’ who co-own the accomodation together, after growing up holidaying on the South Coast. ‘When we purchased the site next door and created The Isla hotel, we kept looking over the fence at the unloved former motel,’ Yanna says. ‘Originally built in the 80s, it was a traditional motel [once called Kon Tiki] with carparks adjacent to room entrances.’ Then earlier this year, they secured the purchase of the run-down property and spent the next few months bringing it back to life. The apartments were in terrible condition, with dilapidated kitchens, worn carpet and decrepit original bathrooms that (sadly) couldn’t be salvaged. ‘The vision for the renovation was to align with the vibe and style of The Isla but to create a moodier and broodier vibe,’ Yanna adds. ‘We repainted the entire property inside and out, designed and installed new kitchens, new flooring throughout, new bathrooms, all new electrical and light fittings, new air conditioning units and new window furnishings. A full face and body lift for Isla’s little cousin!’ All the rooms inside are two-bedroom suites, designed to host groups of four with full kitchens, bathrooms and a lounge room space with a fold-out couch to accomodate an extra two guests if needed. Yanna says each one functions like a little house, which explains the accomodation’s fitting and fun Spanish name Casita, translating to ‘little house’. There’s also a bit of Spanish mission-style flair incorporated in the brick motel’s new paint colours; revealing accents of sangria, sandy browns, and terracotta tiles across the interiors, alongside playful paintings of beachgoers by Melbourne artist Dan Rushford. Outside, they installed an outdoor shower, new custom-striped awnings, and updated the landscaping. But Yanna says in addition to Casita’s idyllic location, the real highlight of the new escape is its privacy. ‘We hope our guests feel like they are in a home away from home, with all the luxuries of a hotel,’ she says. ‘We wanted to provide a comfortable and curated experience, unlike anything else on offer in the Batemans Bay area for larger groups.’ Book a stay at Casita here.",
