With its unique shape and rustic appeal, this candle fits perfectly in both farmhouse-inspired and contemporary interiors. A special mention for its organic design, which can easily bring warmth to your space. Each candle is housed in a beautifully crafted wooden dough bowl with smooth and rounded edges. We especially love its raw finish (and those natural grain patterns) adding character to the space. Measuring roughly 10 inches in length, this candle is just the right size to draw attention without overpowering the decor. Beyond that soft glow, this piece can engage the senses. The wood wicks provide a crackling sound thatâ€™s reminiscent of a cozy fireplace. Talk about a serene ambiance that melts away all that stress. Each candle is made with high-quality soy wax, which is known for its clean and slow-burning properties. The creamy white wax complements the earthy tones of the bowl, making it a versatile addition to neutral or vibrant color schemes alike. The best part? The candle is customizable! You can add a heartfelt message, and there you have it, the perfect gift for the holidays. From rosewood to pumpkin caramel, the candle is available in 24 delightful scents to match your moodâ€”or the season. Whether you prefer sweet, earthy, or floral notes, thereâ€™s an option for everyone. When the candle has fully burned, donâ€™t toss the bowlâ€”reuse it! The versatile wooden vessel can be repurposed as a decorative dish, a trinket holder, or even a plant container. Think of it as an eco-friendly choice that keeps giving ðŸ’š Find this unique piece on Etsy",
