  "text": "Movable Roots designed the Elmore, a 42-foot-long and 8-ft-6-inch-wide customized bumper-pull RV. It is intended to be a home away from home. The tiny house features two entrances, one with a screened-off porch with the ability to accommodate a couple of patio chairs. As you enter the house, you are welcomed by the kitchen. The kitchen is equipped with a stacking washer/dryer combo, next to a fridge with a bottom pull-out freezer. Movable Roots tried to utilize the space available completely, ensuring no area was left unused. Even the stair leading to the loft placed above the kitchen is integrated with custom drawers. Designer: Movable Roots The opposite wall of the kitchen is equipped with a full-size sink and loads of counter space. Windows adorn the space, which may be difficult to clean and maintain, but they do allow a lot of natural light into the space. The windows are openable, allowing fresh air into the space, and refreshing the interior environment. The living room isn’t the largest, but it can fit a L-shaped couch. It is comfortable and cozy, and a mini-split system is perched on a well-insulated wall, ensuring that the home’s temperature can be regulated irrespective of the temperature outside. An interestingly-designed staircase leads you to one of the lofts in the tiny home. It is placed at the front and is smaller than the other bedroom, and it is also more easily accessible. The bedroom is equipped with clever in-wall storage which saves quite a bit of space and adds a visually appealing element to the room. A custom sliding barn door offers privacy to the room. The second rear loft is above the room, and can only be entered via a custom wooden ladder. It is quite huge and can hold three twin-sized beds. While the front loft can accommodate a queen bed. The home includes four mini-split systems in total, and they are all plumbed to a single condenser placed at the rear of the RV. A water hose connection offers fresh water, and the home is powered by an RV-style 50-amp service. The custom-built RV occupies around 500 sq ft and can sleep seven people, and it is priced at around US$225,000.",
