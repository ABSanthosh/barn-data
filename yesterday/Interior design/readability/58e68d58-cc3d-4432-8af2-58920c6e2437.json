  "text": "Thanks for stopping by for this week’s Style Scouting. My Sunday post where I share the random stuff that captured my attention or inspired me that I found online. Hello! This past week I was very productive. I got many things crossed off my to-do list that I have been wanting to do around the house. Nothing major, but all the little things like touching up a baseboard that got dinged, cleaning out a utensil drawer kind of stuff. Then I started getting the house ready for the whole family to come in two weeks. I needed new bedding, a crib, and little boy toys. I headed to the thrift store to find them. I got a quite a lot for $30. When I brought them home, I put them in the bathtub and gave them a good wash and dry. Now they are happily piled in a big basket waiting for Dean. I already have plenty of girl toys for Zoe. Most were saved from the toys my daughters had growing up, but I have been collecting crafty stuff that she likes to do when we are not out enjoying the lake. I also got the new kitchen island completed that I posted about last week. I will take photos tomorrow and share them later this week. It came out just as I envisioned which is always a good thing when DIY’ing. Now onto the links I found for you this week. Grab your coffee, tea or morning beverage of choice and enjoy. :-) Something to Think About How to make your weekends more enjoyable.
