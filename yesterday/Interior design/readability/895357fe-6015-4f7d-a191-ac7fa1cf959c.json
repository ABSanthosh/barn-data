Introduced as part of the brand’s 2025 lineup, these timepieces capture the allure of lunar exploration while offering innovative craftsmanship. Let’s dive into the unique design details and technical features that set these watches apart in Omega’s storied Speedmaster collection. Designer: Omega The Meteorite Dial: A Celestial Touch The defining feature of the Speedmaster Moonphase Meteorite watches lies in their meteorite dials, which are prized by collectors for their rarity and unique patterns formed over millions of years. These dials offer a connection to celestial origins but also ensure that no two watches are ever identical. Available in two versions—black and gray—the dials are crafted from iron meteorite, giving each piece a one-of-a-kind texture and pattern. This celestial material is complemented by the moonphase sub-dial at 6 o’clock, where Northern and Southern Hemisphere lunar phases are depicted using actual lunar meteorite cabochons. The starry background on the moonphase sub-dial replicates the night sky over Biel, Switzerland, on the historic night of the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969. The black dial version features a black PVD-coated meteorite surface paired with 18K white gold hands and indices. For the gray version, Omega uses a galvanic gray meteorite coating, accented by blue PVD-coated hands and a matching bezel. The result is a subtle yet striking contrast that evokes the mysterious beauty of space. A Redesigned Case and Bracelet The 43mm stainless steel case is designed for modern wearability while preserving the Speedmaster’s iconic silhouette. The case thickness is reduced to 13.6mm, aided by the new manual-winding caliber 9914 movement. This updated dimension ensures a more streamlined fit on the wrist compared to earlier Moonphase models. Omega pairs the watch with its stainless steel “Nixon” bracelet, a five-row design featuring polished and brushed links. This bracelet stands out for its ergonomic design, offering a balanced combination of durability and comfort. Its easy-adjustment system ensures a snug fit, making it an excellent choice for daily wear and long-lasting reliability. The bracelet includes an easy-adjustment system within the folding clasp, allowing wearers to tweak the fit for maximum comfort. This thoughtful addition ensures that the Speedmaster Moonphase Meteorite is as functional as it is visually stunning. The Movement: Master Chronometer Caliber 9914 At the heart of these watches lies Omega’s in-house caliber 9914, a manual-winding chronograph movement certified as a Master Chronometer by METAS. This certification ensures exceptional precision, antimagnetic performance up to 15,000 gauss, and reliability under stringent conditions, setting a high benchmark in horological standards. Operating at a frequency of 28,800 vibrations per hour, the caliber 9914 has a 60-hour power reserve, making it ideal for extended wear. The column-wheel mechanism ensures smooth chronograph operation, while the Co-Axial escapement reduces friction for enhanced accuracy and durability over time. The movement’s aesthetics are equally impressive, featuring Geneva waves in Arabesque on rhodium-plated bridges. Its blackened balance wheel, polished screws, and barrels add a layer of sophistication visible through the sapphire case back. This meticulous decoration embodies Omega’s dedication to merging artistry with engineering. Additionally, the hand-wound design contributes to a slimmer case profile, enhancing the overall wearability of the Speedmaster Moonphase Meteorite watches. Functional Aesthetics and Legacy The ceramic bezel insert features a tachymeter scale rendered in white enamel, a nod to the Speedmaster’s racing heritage. In addition to the chronograph and moonphase functions, the watch includes a pointer date sub-dial at 9 o’clock and chronograph hour and minute counters at 3 o’clock. Despite its complexity, the layout remains clean and legible, adhering to Omega’s emphasis on usability. The Speedmaster Moonphase Meteorite watches also celebrate Omega’s deep ties to space exploration. From the meteorite dials to the lunar cabochons, every element reflects the brand’s dedication to preserving its Moonwatch legacy while innovating for the future. The gray-dial version channels the aesthetic of the Silver Snoopy Award 50th Anniversary model, offering a touch of nostalgia for collectors. These celestial timepieces come with a premium price tag, retailing at €19,000 (including VAT) / $17,100 (excluding tax) / CHF 15,000 (excluding tax). This pricing places them in the upper tier of luxury watches, aligning with other high-end models like the Rolex Daytona or Vacheron Constantin Overseas, which command similar attention for their craftsmanship and exclusivity. While the cost reflects the rare materials and craftsmanship involved, the Speedmaster Moonphase Meteorite remains a highly collectible addition to Omega’s lineup. Ultimately, the Omega Speedmaster Moonphase Meteorite watches exemplify the brand’s ability to blend technical mastery with artistic innovation. Whether you’re drawn to the black meteorite dial or the gray version with blue accents, these timepieces offer a timeless connection to the mysteries of space. They serve as a reminder of humanity’s enduring fascination with the moon and the craftsmanship that brings such visions to life.",
