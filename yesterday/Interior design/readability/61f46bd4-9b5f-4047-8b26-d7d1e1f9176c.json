  "text": "In contrast to the somewhat soulless style of minimalistic interiors that were commonplace in the early 2000s, warm minimalism champions simplicity without feeling stark, bare, or boring. The timeless look has its roots in Japanese and Scandinavian interior design, both driven by a ‘less is more’ approach, and the Danish concept of Hygge — which is all about creating spaces that feel cosy and comfortable. Think soft textures, natural materials, a warm neutral colour palette and cosy lighting. It’s easier than you think to bring this heartwarming energy into your home! It’s important to start with a relatively neutral backdrop. This doesn’t mean painting all the walls white, but perhaps selecting a soft shade with warm, blush, or creamy undertones, to create an inviting and clean base. You can play with other similar neutral tonal hues in your furniture, or add a contrasting moment for extra flair. For example, how fun are the green window frames in interior designer Alison Lewis’ Melbourne home? Timber floors are a great way instantly bring warmth into a space. Kustom Timber’s sun-kissed Beach House Floorboard is perfect to help set the tone and pair with other earthy tiles and stones. The real fun comes in layering the right furniture and lighting picks. These spaces don’t necessarily have a hero feature that pulls focus in a room. Instead, they appear inviting and harmonious thanks to the limited palette of tonal colours. Since cosiness is key, we’d opt for a plush wool rug like the Eden by Armadillo, styled with simple pendant and lamp lighting that emits a warm glow, alongside the rounded shapes of DOMO’s HC28 Cosmo Bola Side Chairs, or an extra-pillowy armchair like Arflex Marenco Armchair from Space Furniture!
