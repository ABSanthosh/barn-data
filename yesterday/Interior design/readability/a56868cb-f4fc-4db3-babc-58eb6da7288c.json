Every time I go somewhere, I spend the entire trip searching for a new favorite to add to my wall — sometimes I buy a few from each location so I have options. I have a postcard dedicated to my home state of Michigan, one to commemorate my first college spring break to Colorado Springs, Colorado, and one for each European city I visited last winter. Right now they’re just taped to my wall, but I’ve dedicated my summer to leveling up my decor, and I knew it was time for a more mature look for some of my most prized souvenirs. As detailed in the video, you start by opening up a picture frame. You could either buy one that matches the exact vibe you’re going with or you could thrift one if you’re looking to save some money. Then, trace the size of the frame’s backing on a sheet of paper before centering the postcard — or whatever else you want to feature — in the tracing. Cut out the template you just created, leaving a hole for the image. Next, Kirsten uses leftover fabric from the bottom of her curtains to wrap around the paper template. (This caused quite a stir among commenters, who thought she hacked off the fabric on the spot. But the creator clarified it was leftover fabric from when the curtains were hemmed “ages ago.”) You could also use scrapbook or wrapping paper or leftover wallpaper instead to get a similar look. Glue the fabric to the template and trim any excess before taping the postcard in place and putting the whole thing back in the frame. I love when wall art is reflective of someone’s life, and this picture frame hack is such an easy way to up your decor game and sprinkle your mementos around your walls. With just a few supplies, you can graduate from taped-up postcards or photos to purposeful and stylish art pieces.",
