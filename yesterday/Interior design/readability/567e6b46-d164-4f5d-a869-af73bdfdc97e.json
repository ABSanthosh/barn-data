  "description": "This captivating, hobnail-textured bottle contains La Petite Victoire, a non-alcoholic sparkling beverage. It's by global package design firm Stranger \u0026 Stranger. I wasn't able to find any details about this specific project, though I did learn that Stranger \u0026 Stranger is a sort of hit-machine firm for the alcoholic beverages industry. In an interview with industry periodical SevenFiftyDaily, writer Alia Akkam reveals that the firm's packaging rebrands \"have tripled sales for some wine and spirits labels.\"Stranger \u0026 Stranger founder Kevin Shaw reveals a little of the company's secret sauce, and notes a particularly effective package design turnaround:Each label Stranger \u0026 Stranger makes is a distillation of a brand's distinct narrative. \"You dig,\" Shaw says. \"You keep asking questions and probing until you find something ownable, hopefully unique, something enticing and interesting.\" He points to the reboot of Aberfeldy Scotch as an example. Originally, the label featured a squirrel, an image that confounded Shaw. On learning that the springwater Aberfeldy uses at the distillery contains gold dust, Shaw immediately knew this would become the focus for the new design—a gilt-hued label. \"A golden dram,\" he says. \"That's something unusual, something that's rooted in truth, something you can build a brand on. Consumers love stories like that. A year's worth of stock sold out in 12 weeks.\"If you're interested in design business, the full interview is worth a read, and covers the unlikely way that Shaw started the firm in 1994. To date they've done over 5,000 projects.",
