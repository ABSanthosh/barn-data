  "description": "The Melbourne family home of TDF photographer Eve Wilson is arguably one of the best we’ve ever featured — and now it’s on the market! After living next door for almost a decade, Eve and her husband Jon Atchison bought the Cremorne worker’s cottage with a vision to unlock its untapped potential with a transformative renovation by Studio Bright. Every inch of the 144-square-metre home was designed to perfection. From the serene courtyard to the breeze block exterior, it’s an idyllic inner-city oasis that’s ready for a new owner.",

  "text": "Photographer Eve Wilson and Jon Atchison gave Studio Bright a relatively open brief when it came to renovating their Cremorne home a few years ago. ‘We wanted something with texture and colour, as much greenery as possible, and maybe some breeze blocks,’ Eve says. The couple and their two kids, Elliot (9) and June (7), had been living next door for a decade before purchasing the worker’s cottage just next door, which had a northern laneway that they wanted to maximise in the renovation. It had been mostly untouched for the better part of 50 years, so ‘we were essentially starting from scratch’, Eve adds. Anything the 144-square-metre floor plan lacks in size; it makes up for with its impeccable design and architectural flair! Two bedrooms, a study, and a bathroom are located inside the original cottage, while the kitchen and living room — both opening onto to a serene, leafy courtyard garden — feature in the new extension. ‘The internal courtyard and surrounding glass corridor create a real oasis,’ Eve says. ‘When you open up both sets of doors, it doubles in size and you have a bright indoor-outdoor space.’ A built-in daybed provides an idyllic spot to watch the dappled light filter through this part of the home, as joinery painted in Dulux Dollar brings even more greenery into the tonal interiors. Upstairs, there’s the dreamy main bedroom and bathroom with a sunken Roman bath covered in a mosaic of green tiles, alongside a rooftop deck at the very top, where you can take in views of the city skyline! Eve and Jon didn’t plan on leaving their three-bedroom sanctuary so soon. But after almost four years in the home, they’ve listed it for sale in search of a new home with a little bit more space for their growing daughters. ‘We really, really love this home and the memories we have created here,’ Eve adds. ‘We’ll definitely miss all the design details: the sunken tiled bath, Palladiana terrazzo flooring, rich colour palette and custom in-built furniture. And the location couldn’t get any better, we’ve got the MCG, Botanic Gardens and Yarra River a short walk away.’ They only hope that the new owner enjoys living in this peaceful inner-city refuge as much as they have! 72 Wellington Street, Cremorne, VIC 3121 is listed for sale with Jellis Craig Richmond and will go to auction on May 17 at 2pm.",
