Inspired by the lowercase letter “a” from the AH Forma typeface, the ORMA Chair merges the worlds of typography and furniture design into a modern and functional masterpiece. Designed for Design Week Mexico 2024, this piece transforms a familiar character into a sculptural and practical form of seating. Designer:  Andrés Higueros and (ro)drigo méndez sosa The ORMA Chair showcases how the shapes and proportions of a type family can serve as a base for much more than just text. The AH Forma typeface, known for its versatile use across various contexts, becomes the backbone of this innovative design, transforming the flat, two-dimensional letter into a three-dimensional piece of furniture. This bold experimentation with type reminds us how far design can stretch when creative boundaries are pushed. The chair’s design uses the rounded portion of the letter “a” as its seat. Depending on how it’s positioned, there are two different ways to experience the chair. In one form, the rounded seat offers comfort, while the terminal of the letter serves as a handrest. Alternatively, when reversed, the terminal transforms into a backrest, providing ergonomic support. It’s fascinating to imagine the comfort it offers, although one might wonder how long one could remain seated given its unconventional structure, making it more of an art piece than a prolonged seating solution. The ORMA Chair comes in two distinct models: the “Light” and “Regular” versions, each reflecting the characteristics of their respective typeface styles. The “Light” version, known as ORMA Chair Light Condensed, interprets the lightness and elegance of the AH Forma Light style into a sleek dining chair. This version uses the terminal as a backrest and the rounded parts as legs, resembling the minimalist structure of early bicycles. The “Regular” version, aptly named ORMA Chair Regular, translates the balanced and sturdier style of the Regular typeface into a comfortable armchair. The design variation between these two chairs reflects how typography can be adapted to suit different environments while maintaining a shared aesthetic foundation. The Condensed version of the ORMA Chair is ideal for more refined and contemporary spaces, perfect for dining rooms or stylish corners in elegant homes. On the other hand, the Regular version’s balanced design makes it more suitable for informal settings such as office lobbies or relaxed living spaces. Despite their differences, both chairs uphold a common theme: transforming a typographic symbol into a usable, functional object.",
