  "text": "Every year we look forward to seeing what new colour trends will spring up with the changing seasons. Last year we saw more vibrant blues and reds take centre stage, but this summer Dulux forecasters predict a combination of ‘almost-pastel’ hues emerging. In fact, Dulux’s summer palette has been coined ‘Dulux Emerge’ to reflect this joyful trend. Expect to see softly saturated green (Dulux Cornstalk), yellow (Dulux Lemon Blast), pink (Dulux Piglet), orange (Dulux Terracotta Chip) and beiges (Dulux Clay Bake and Dulux Hog Bristle Quarter) come together with rich rhubarb (Dulux Ripe Rhubarb) and bold denim blue (Dulux Justice) for a uniquely creative and hopeful look. ‘The Dulux Emerge palette has the power to completely transform a space into a sunny sanctuary and evoke a care-free attitude,’ says colour and communications manager Andrea Lucena-Orr. Stylist Bree Banfield suggests a good starting point for these ‘almost-pastel’ hues is to use large sections of the warmer shades on walls and ceilings, and potentially also for large furniture pieces. When it comes to accent colours, lean towards the cooler colours within the palette – these cooler tones can be introduced via decorative objects, cushions and artwork. ‘Visually, the trend features soft rounded forms and expressive collections of decor, crafted with modularity and curves. These shapes and free-flowing lines add to the whimsical yet calming nature of the trend,’ says Andrea. Joining these rounded forms are playful patterns and shapes that add to the lighthearted nature of this palette. Look for quirky vessels, still life artworks featuring florals or summer delicacies, coloured lighting and coastal textures, such as wicker and rattan. Remember, this palette is inspired by hope and creativity, so have fun with it! To revive your home this summer, Dulux is offering the chance to WIN 25 litres of Dulux paint and a $1,000 Bonnie and Neil voucher. To go into the running, fill out the entry form below.",
