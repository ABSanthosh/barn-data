  "description": "Sprout is an industrial design consultancy that not only does design work, but invests in promising startups. They spied a business opportunity in Yardhaus, a startup that focuses on enhancing outdoor living space.At Home, Outside: Introducing YARDHAUS, a Sprout Ventures-Backed CompanyIntroA major home trend in home improvement is the transition of indoor lifestyle elements to the outdoor areas of the home, outfitting decks, patios, and porches with the same comfort, convenience, and technology typically only found inside. As the founders of YARDHAUS sought to transform their outdoor spaces, they discovered there were no existing string light hanging systems. Recognizing a gap in the market, they sought a solution that enhances the aesthetic appeal of outdoor spaces while simplifying the installation process.Sprout Ventures saw this as a prime investment opportunity, perfectly aligning with our entrepreneurial nature and commitment to supporting innovative, early-stage startups. As part of our business model, we invest in startups by taking part-equity and part-cash payments in exchange for our services. The companies we invest in leverage the full breadth of Sprout's multidisciplinary team to propel projects from concept to launch, ensuring a comprehensive approach to development and market success.The ChallengeTackling Inefficiencies in Outdoor IlluminationYARDHAUS partnered with Sprout to design the Pillar Pro Deck System to address the problem of a complete lack of viable string light installation products. Traditional methods often required ad hoc solutions from big-box hardware retailers, resulting in a time-consuming and frustrating experience– one that didn't really solve anything. The Pillar Pro system offers a streamlined solution, revolutionizing how homeowners enhance their outdoor spaces.The ApproachDesigning the Ultimate Outdoor Lighting ExperienceLeveraging the full breadth of Sprout's multidisciplinary team, we developed the YARDHAUS Pillar Pro Deck System, ensuring a premium blend of simplicity, elegance, and functionality. Our comprehensive approach encompassed the full Sprout service profile – product research, insights and strategy, industrial design, branding, packaging, merchandising, marketing collateral development, product rendering, and animation – culminating in a premium solution that revolutionizes outdoor lighting installations. Product DesignOur industrial design team developed the Pillar Pro Deck System to embody simplicity and sophistication. Comprising just two primary components—the Crown Elite anchor and Pillar Pro pole—the design facilitates effortless string light installation and adjustment, ensuring a hassle-free experience for users. Its sleek and minimalist aesthetic seamlessly blends with any outdoor setting, enhancing the ambiance while complementing existing decor and architectural elements. BrandingThe brand team crafted the identity by defining key attributes, shaping the brand's personality, and establishing its voice. The outcome aims to evoke an air of poise and refinement, characterized by a serene color palette, assured simplicity, and a visually straightforward design language. Every touchpoint is designed for a consistent and compelling brand experience in every interaction. Package DesignWe designed a comprehensive structural and graphic packaging system for the YARDHAUS product line. Through rigorous testing and refinement, the packaging solution not only safeguards the product but also enhances its shelf appeal, effectively communicating its quality to consumers with a premium unboxing experience. MerchandisingSprout developed engaging retail displays that highlight the features and benefits of the Pillar Pro system, enticing customers with the promise of transforming their outdoor spaces with ease and style. The retail displays are designed to seize shoppers' attention, swiftly communicate benefits, and maintain interest with a simple and inviting appeal. Product RenderingThroughout the design and development process, Sprout's in-house visualization team played a pivotal role in bringing the Pillar Pro system to life. Photorealistic 3D renderings and videos provided stakeholders with compelling visuals that accelerated the go-to-market timeline and garnered support from retailers and investors alike.Insights and StrategyOur strategic approach began with in-depth product research to define clear objectives and milestones. By analyzing user behavior and market trends, we identified key pain points and opportunities for innovation. The Sprout team developed a naming strategy that supports future expansion, and a comprehensive product roadmap to align the YARDHAUS vision with market needs. The OutcomeRedefining Outdoor AmbianceYARDHAUS has garnered rave reviews on platforms like Amazon, with users praising its quality and ease of use. Beyond its lighting capabilities, the Pillar Pro system is poised for future expansion, with plans to expand into accessories supporting outdoor areas of the home with the same comfort, convenience, and technology typically only found inside.
