Click here for above sources 5 Ideas to Make Your Kitchen Fresh + Pretty for Spring 1. A Basket for Spring Plants One thing that always feels like spring to me is real plants and flowers. Since our pups eat my plants, I realized the safest place for me to have real plants and florals is in the kitchen. My theme of the year is “a place for everything and everything in its place” so with that in mind, I’ve been on the lookout for planters for my kitchen. Planter Basket When I saw this basket, I knew it would be so cute for displaying small potted plants or flowers (real or faux) and I could even change them out in every season! I used five small potted plants and they fit perfectly inside. I could use this anywhere in the kitchen or in other rooms of the house, so it’s a very flexible basket. I know people have particular feelings about sink placement but we love having our sink here because we have a view out every window. I thought placing this basket behind the sink was extra fun since we have the space, plus it feels like an indoor window box! And if you don’t do your dishes, it’s a clever trick to hide any dishes in the sink too :). Now I look forward to how I can use this basket to bring joy to our kitchen in every season. Sink // Faucet // Basket 2. A Fresh and Shiny Spring Sink + Faucet One reason I didn’t worry about having a sink in the island was because I like to have the motivation to keep the sink and area around it fresh and pretty. I’m very adverse to piles of dirty dishes and crud stuck on sinks and faucets :). Faucet // Sink The first thing we chose for our kitchen when we renovated was a beautiful classic faucet–I’ve owned several faucets in this brand and love them so much. It feels so luxurious to use it, so I love to keep the finish shiny (I just use a soft cloth). It was a worthwhile splurge for the joy it brings. We also chose a glistening white sink (so we’re inspired to keep it that way!). I’ve had this same sink installed in three kitchens now, it’s been a long time favorite! Even if you don’t have a shiny new sink, you can still enjoy the results of spring cleaning to make your sink and faucet fresher and prettier. It’s amazing what a little spring cleaning can do to lift one’s spirits after a long dark winter. Here’s a good tip! Always do the dishes before bed and finish by polishing up the sink and faucet. I learned this from my mom (and the Flylady) and it never fails to bring more beauty and joy to the following day. You can also improve the area around the sink (see tip #3) 3. Make the Area Around the Sink Pretty I’ve been on the hunt for something to hold our hand soap and sink brushes. I don’t like to leave random objects on the counter but you do need hand soap! We don’t like to let soap drip all over our counters so I’m thrilled to have found this gorgeous marble tray! It is just the right size to hold not only hand soap but this pretty floral utensil jar that I’m using for dish brushes. It brings a touch of spring to our sink area. Floral utensil jar // marble tray I also love to get a new stack of clean kitchen towels for spring. These are so adorable with the stripes and they are reversible with terry cloth on the back! 4. Bring a Touch of Spring to Everyday Rituals I love decorating for the seasons by swapping out dishes and simple accessories. These lidded airtight canisters with the cheerful botanical patterns make me happy for spring! A place for everything and everything in its place. I got this 7 inch canister and this 5.5 inch canister. 7 inch canister // 5.5 inch canister Measuring Pitcher This measuring pitcher is my favorite new addition to the kitchen! It’s perfect for watering flowers, too. One thing I’ve come to realize about myself is that I love calming neutrals but also feel energized by pretty colors. Rather than choosing one or another, I’m embracing both by collecting dishes I love for spring and summer and others for fall and winter. I’ve always done this with salad plates (or hanging plates on the wall!) but now that I have a built in plate rack I can use our plates to decorate that too, so I’m excited to collect a few more. 5. Pretty Placemats for Spring I love these pretty floral placemats for spring! They are so easy to wipe off, have cork backing, and they are heat resistant, too. We use one placemat under our toaster, too. It makes it easy to slide the toaster out and protects the counters. Botanical Placemats with Cork Back // Measuring Pitcher Here are some more decor finds at Wayfair lately (click the images below for details!) and be sure to check out the Spring Savings event here!",
