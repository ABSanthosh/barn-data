  "description": "This Queenslander in Grange, Brisbane was always beautiful, but both its original and renovated interiors (introduced in 2002) didn’t respond well to the site, climate, and the needs of its new owners. A recent renovation by Bones Studio has rectified these issues, introducing a large void along the southern side of the home to significantly enhance its natural light, and bring tropical greenery into the home. It’s now a more functional and delightful home with a rationally zoned interior and connections to the outdoors throughout.",

  "text": "Before this 1920s Queenslander’s recent transformation, the entrance to the property was on the upper floor, and the interior was dark and enclosed. In addition, a significant 2002 renovation had marred the home’s original character, introducing two faux traditional gables for an awkward looking facade. It was Bones Studio’s job to address these issues, while better connecting the home with the outdoors. The design practice’s core approach was introducing a large void along the southern side of the house (replacing the kitchen), and moving all communal spaces downstairs. A suspended concrete planter bed beside the void adds depth to the light, casting dynamic, dappled shadows throughout the day. To align with the home’s new spatial arrangement, the front door was relocated to the ground level, and the original front stairs removed. Chris Brandon, director of Bones Studio, explains, ‘Previously, the retained front yard at street level blocked northern light from reaching the ground floor. ‘By excavating and terracing the site, we opened up the ground-level entry, allowing natural light to flow into the interior. ‘Additionally, removing one of the faux gables helped restore the front facade to its original Queenslander character.’ Newly introduced materials in the project including solid Victorian ash are classic and bright, working to enhance natural light from the new void and skylight. ‘The new wall linings feature simple flat boards (plasterboard and fibre cemet) to differentiate from the more intricate VJ and weatherboard linings in the original Queenslander,’ says Chris. The updated floor plan sees all the living spaces on the ground floor, and all bedrooms above (except for a versatile study/playroom/fifth bedroom). These living areas now spill out onto the outdoor spaces, including a basketball hoop to the south, and the outdoor dining area and new pool to the west. Lush greenery by Hortum Landscaping is brought into the home through views from the void, high windows above the dining area capturing cascading plants, floor-to-ceiling doors opening to the backyard, and a densely planted ‘lawn’ on the main bedroom balcony. Chris says the biggest challenge of the project was engineering and detailing the suspended concrete planter bed. ‘Initially, an engineer suggested it was impossible without large concrete blade columns. We sought a second opinion and collaborated with another engineer [Inertia Engineering] to achieve a more elegant structural solution,’ he says. ‘We are most proud that we were able to solve the aspects of a complex brief.’ The previously underutilised backyard is now a central activity space for the family, providing a seamless indoor-outdoor connection that enhances daily living.",
