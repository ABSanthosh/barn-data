Secondly, it frees the body of the bike from the task of holding the motor—everything is now contained within that rear wheel. That means the entire body of the bike can now be filled with batteries, adding range. Furthermore:\"The Verge Next Platform redefines vehicle design, drastically lowering the threshold for creating new two-wheelers. By eliminating unnecessary moving parts, the architecture and engineering processes become significantly simpler and more streamlined.\" \"Our solution brings multiple benefits: decreased weight leads to greater efficiency, reduced manufacturing complexity minimizes costs, and fewer components translate to lower maintenance needs over the vehicle's lifetime.\"The company has not only incorporated the Donut Motor into their own bikes, but is now licensing the technology.
