  "text": "DJI is invincible when it comes to compact drones loaded with features and advanced collision avoidance tech. DJI Mini 4 Pro and Mavic 3 Pro leave buyers with very little scope for getting anything else – they are so good. But any number of factors can put your flying machine at risk of crashing on the rocks, no matter how good are the sensors onboard. Bad weather, abrupt bird collisions, signal loss, or battery outages can toast your expensive drone beyond repair. Since a drone is indispensable for any number of industries ranging from entertainment, content creation, logistics, or purely for personal purposes – the next drone evolution is more than welcome. Meet Emeth designed by Design House (a division of SAES) this drone is all about safety when operating in inhospitable and unknown terrain. A Nitinol-based project, it poses a significant step forward in drone technology. Designer: SAES The drone is a result of advanced material science and the vision for developing practical safety solutions. It is made out of the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) method wherein the aluminum-magnesium alloy is molded into a single-body drone. Just for the record, this material has more strength and is lighter than carbon fiber. Emeth comes with a never-before-seen airbag system that deploys in a mere 40 milliseconds in case the drone comes falling from the sky. This is vital in emergencies to minimize the impact on the ground. The airbag itself is reusable and lightweight enough to deploy on the drone again. SAES has patented this inflatable airbag technology in major jurisdictions like Europe, the United States, Japan, and China. The gimbals have also been replaced by Nitinol, an advanced memory alloy that stabilizes the camera for high-quality footage, and also powers the airbag system. This material is compact and reduces bulk, so the drone has more carrying capacity and longer operation time. The whole framework of the flying machine is centered on optimal load distribution and the highest torsional strength possible. Emeth comes with a transparent protective shell that makes it an exciting gadget to own. The see-through shell exposes the internal workings of the machine which makes it visually appealing. Just like Nothing popularized transparent aesthetics for its gadgets, and the likes of the Nintendo Game Boy Color Clear and Pontiac Ghost, this drone will also carry a distinct appeal among the competition. For now, Emeth is a work in progress and we can’t wait to see what the final iteration of this cool drone will be like.",
