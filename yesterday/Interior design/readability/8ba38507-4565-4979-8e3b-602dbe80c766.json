  "text": "Close your eyes and think of a cyberpunk poster of a city skyline. Focus your attention on the sunset – usually, it’s represented by a circle split in two… with the upper half being a solid yellow or orange, and the lower half being a set of lines, looking like the sunset’s ripples on an ocean or sea. Just google Cyberpunk Sunset and you’ll see exactly what I’m talking about. Now, imagine that as an actual lamp and you get the Bauhaus Sunset Lamp from Simig Lighting – a minimally gorgeous lamp that abstracts the sun into something familiar digitally, represented physically. For long, the internet was dominated by sunset lamps, those cylindrical lights with fisheye lenses that cast a perfect circle of light on any wall, looking like a sunset of sorts. While that sunset lamp had its ‘time in the sun’, this one is slowly and surely taking over the internet, enchanting an entire generation of cyberpunk-loving people who now graduated to loving IKEA, Pottery Barn, and West Elm. Designer: Simig Lighting The lamp looks great on its own, but even more so when placed in front of a large window, allowing its reflection to be superimposed upon a dusky sunset. The illusion gets created perfectly (just look at the image above), as you see a cyberpunk-ish sun floating in the air, hovering right above the horizon. The lamp’s warm orange/ochre color makes it look exactly like a sunset too, creating what I can only describe as the perfect optical illusion! The lampshade comes made from a combination of glass as well as acrylic. The glass dome sits on top, diffusing the light from two LED bulbs wonderfully into that pastel-ish yellow glow. Meanwhile, orange-colored acrylic rings on the bottom catch the rest of the light, glowing in entirety thanks to acrylic’s edge-lighting property. This allows the sun to look the way it does, as the lamp’s upper dome and lower rings glow with almost the same intensity, creating the perfect effect. No other material could have done the same kind of magic. Each Bauhaus Sunset Lamp is powered by three E27 bulbs, and comes in multiple sizes depending on the kind of interior space you have. Simig Lighting makes a blue and white version too, which personally isn’t my cup of tea. This colorway right here is as perfect as it gets, given that it does such a remarkable job of nailing the aesthetic it’s trying to go for. The lamps start at $88 for the smallest size (6.3 inches wide), going up to $183 for the largest size which measures almost a foot in diameter.",
