  "text": "If you were alive during the 80s and the original Macintosh was first released, you probably saw their iconic computer iconography in “real time”. They were pretty distinguishable from the existing computer graphics at that time and that was due to the fact that they were designed by computer iconographer Susan Kare. She was trained in fine arts rather than graphic design so she was able to bring something really creative and different to the typefaces and icons that became entwined with Apple. They have become part of our visual computer language even to this day. Designers: Susan Kare and Asprey Studio New icons designed by Susan Kare are now brought to life to a unique collection by Asprey Studio. She has designed 32 icons that reimagine technology as a medium for exploring the precious aspects of life. Called the Esc Keys, these icons invite us to “escape” somewhere where technology and art intertwine. The name “Esc Keys” is a play on words, drawing inspiration from the ‘esc’ key on a computer keyboard and the broader concept of ‘escapism.’ It encourages us to reflect on the humanity that exists beyond the digital world, reminding us that technology can be a tool to appreciate the beauty and meaning in our lives. Theses 43 new icons are available as enamelled images either on sterling silver or gold vermeil computer keys that are handcrafted by the Asprey Studio Workshop. They can be mounted on a mechanical keyboard, which is pretty popular right now for those who like to experiment with their computer accessories. It’s also available as a necklace pendant, also in sterling silver or gold vermeil, also handcrafted by the workshop. It transforms these icons into wearable art to bridge “the worlds of technology, design, and craftsmanship.” Whenever you purchase any of the Esc Keys collection, you also get the corresponding digital artwork inscribed on the blockchain, adding another element into this interplay between the tangible and the virtual. Some of the icons in the collection include various flower designs, the heart icon, a book, wave icon, love letters, several animal icons, an alien, and the Panic! key that she famously installed on her own personal keyboard. This collection, then, is more than just a nostalgic nod to the past. It’s a contemporary exploration of how digital symbols can be transformed into objects of beauty and meaning. By bridging the gap between the digital and physical realms, Kare and Asprey Studio invite us to reconsider our relationship with technology, reminding us that even in the most technical of landscapes, there is room for artistry, humanity, and a touch of whimsical escape.",
