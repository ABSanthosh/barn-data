  "description": "Although Phillip Potthast has been reading Core77 since his time as an industrial design student, he never anticipated that he might one day appear in its pages talking about bees. \"I was more into automotive and car design, actually,\" he reminisces. \"And I've just pivoted, one hundred and eighty degrees, into tree hollows.\"Phillip Potthast's novel beehive design, HIIVE, evolved out of an industrial design thesis that originally sought to create a more ergonomic hive. After venturing into the field, however, Potthast witnessed first-hand the beekeepers' treatments against Varroa mites - a common honeybee parasite - and the aftereffects that these treatments had on the bees themselves. Ergonomics, he quickly realized, may not be the most pressing challenge that many beekeepers faced.When you're so happy with your molded parts you show them the beach at sunset.Honey bees help to pollinate as much as three-quarters of all flowers, and a third of the world's crops. These crucial critters, however, now find themselves also facing modern stressors like climate change, pesticides, and industrial food systems. In response, Potthast's designs aim to improve a beehive's overall health by harkening back to the era before humans developed the squat, utilitarian, honey-farming bee boxes that now dominate your average apiary. Left to their own devices in nature, honeybees often set up shop in the hollows of centuries-old tree trunks.\"Bees actually behave a bit like a power plant,\" Potthast explains. \"In summer and winter alike, they manage a relatively complex thermodynamic and hydrodynamic system. They constantly create a microclimate, which we specifically support through our product.\" Even when the outside temperature drops to freezing, this cluster of bees can maintain a core temperature as high as thirty degrees Celsius while safely nestled in HIIVE's 44-liter cavity. The bees enter through an angled \"flight hole\" at the bottom, which enables both easy entry and defense against intruders.\"The first prototypes, actually, had been just for the bees. It was a nightmare to use,\" Potthast recalls, sitting within arm's reach of a HIIVE in the company's offices, on the outskirts of Berlin. \"It only became human-centered and user-friendly in the second phase.\"Some of HIIVE's current design stems not just from human usage, but human regulation (under German law, for example, beehives must provide access to the breeding room to allow testing for American foulbrood, a spore-forming bacterium that can be fatal to colonies). Compared to classic hives, HIIVE also does not aim to maximize extraction of honey for human consumption. This novel model, however, has occasionally resulted in a significant learning curve for novice beekeepers.\"We have a really, really low Varroa mite pressure in our beehives,\" Potthast says, referring to the degree of infestation (for which beekeeping guidelines typically suggest a treatment every few months, to keep the infestation below two mites for every hundred bees). \"For some people, it's even hard to believe if they don't try it themselves. We have the customers thinking they don't have Varroa pressure, and therefore some of them think they don't need treatments. But you have to read the bees in a much different way than in a box.\" Since its launch, HIIVE been working to release a full tutorial for their users: \"You can do so much wrong with bees,\" Potthast cautions.Early on, Phillip Potthast found a willing collaborator in his partner, Fabian Wischmann, whose knowledge of business and startups became a key ingredient of HIIVE's success. Together, Potthast and Wischmann launched a Kickstarter in 2022 that exceeded their goals more than fifteen-fold - raising over 140,000 Euros, from hundreds of backers. Their success, however, did not come about purely organically. \"You really have to invest substantial amounts to gain necessary visibility,\" Potthast notes. \"It's a pay-to-win system. You need an advertising agency. Otherwise, you're just going totally under.\"The HIIVE team did, unfortunately, encounter multiple production delays over the following two years (suppliers that ordered the incorrect steel, for instance). But HIIVE remains quite satisfied with their partners: some of their 2023 updates, for instance, included videos of the injection molding at Irmamolde facilities in Portugal; the HIIVE's fabric cover, meanwhile, comes from a German mountaineering company, VAUDE, that already had experience making waterproof, UV-resistant PFAS-free gear (PFASs, or \"per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances,\" are a group of synthetic chemicals notorious as persistent organic pollutants, also known as \"forever chemicals\"). Backers' orders began to ship early last year.The vast majority of HIIVE's supporters - ninety-six percent, at HIIVE's count - consider themselves hobbyists. One such backer, Thomas Zimmerling of Frankfurt, has a day job as a managing director of a consulting firm, but happily testified to his experiences with the HIIVE after almost a year of use. \"The materials are extremely high quality,\" Zimmerling reported, in an email to Core77. \"HIIVE requires less effort [than traditional hives]: I can check the condition of the bee colony very quickly, don't have to worry about additional insulation in winter, and can treat against the Varroa mite very easily.\"Another one of HIIVE's most compelling features, however, is still waiting to be released. \"This is our sensor,\" Potthast says, dangling a small collection of circuit boards and wires in his fingers. \"It's beautiful,\" he muses, admiringly. \"A masterpiece of electrical engineering. The result of cross-disciplinary collaboration - which is not solely my achievement.\"Although each HIIVE can function without the sensor and accompanying gateway - a palm-sized device with three finger-sized antennas - the electronics would allow keepers to monitor a swarm's activity, arrival, or even level of vibrations within the hive (as a proxy for the brood's health and mood).These electronic components, however, have taken significant time to perfect. \"The sensors have a runtime of one year,\" Potthast says. \"Taking something to such a low power is a lot of work, and also a lot of engineering.\" HIIVE has also been saddled with having to certify three different radio signals - LoRaWAN, WiFi, and BLE - across multiple countries. This array of signals aims to cover multiple use cases - from HIIVEs kept within wifi range in a back garden, to a keeper who keeps them on a distant property and would utilize a GSM module (as used in cell phones) to monitor them from afar. As a result, HIIVE is currently in the process of launching a second Kickstarter - but this time, purely for the electronics.Going forward, Potthast feels especially excited to have their work officially assessed by animal scientists, whose research he'd heavily incorporated into HIIVE's design. \"All the bullet points from the scientists that they'd gathered over the years,\" Potthast explains, \"by observing tree hollows, the most natural home of honeybees: we took these scientific findings, shaped them, and turned this knowledge about bee tree hollows into a product/tool to make it accessible for beekeepers and their animals.\" Just this year, HIIVE has partnered with a consortium of bee scientists who have undertaken observations on a set of ten hives, which would help grant legitimacy to the company's claims of having such low Varroa mite pressure.\"Normally, as an industrial designer, you take care of usability: things have to look nice, and shiny, and the most ergonomic,\" Potthast opines. \"But to mimic a 200 to 300-year-old tree hollow?

This array of signals aims to cover multiple use cases - from HIIVEs kept within wifi range in a back garden, to a keeper who keeps them on a distant property and would utilize a GSM module (as used in cell phones) to monitor them from afar.
