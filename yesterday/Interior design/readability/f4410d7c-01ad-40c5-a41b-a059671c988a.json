  "description": "Home exercise equipment is typically bulky and unattractive. German manufacturer NOHRD breaks the mold by employing craftspeople to build their SlimBeam, a small-footprint cable machine designed to be aesthetically pleasing while taking up little space. Wrapped in wood, it features a set of height-adjustable pulleys in a butterfly arrangement, accommodating a variety of exercises. The weights are hidden in the back.

Here we get a look at their actual production process:NOHRD does have U.S. distribution, and the machines start at $2,000 for the Oak finish; stepping up to Cherry and Walnut raise the price by $400 and $500, respectively.",
