  "text": "Custom Container Living has cleverly converted a standard 20-foot shipping container into a sleek, ultra-compact tiny house called The Nook. Offering just 160 square feet (14.8 square meters) of living space, this minimalist home is designed for two, balancing affordability with smart design. The exterior features a striking black finish, complemented by stylish cedar accents, while strategically placed windows and doors bring in natural light. To ensure comfort in all seasons, The Nook is insulated with closed-cell foam, helping to regulate temperature inside the metal shell. It’s a practical and budget-friendly solution for simple, modern living. Designer: Custom Container Living The interior of The Nook embraces simplicity, with nearly everything arranged within a single open-plan space—an efficient choice for its small footprint. Everything is on one level, making movement easy and practical in such a compact home. The front door, featuring large windows, leads directly into the kitchen. Despite its size, the kitchen is well-equipped with a sink, cabinetry, fridge/freezer, and microwave, plus room for a few extra appliances if needed. The bathroom is tucked away behind a sliding door and offers all the essentials: a shower, a sink, and a flushing toilet. The layout is streamlined, making the most of every inch while keeping daily living convenient and comfortable. Aside from a wall-mounted mini-split air-conditioner, The Nook comes unfurnished, allowing the owner to personalize the space. To make the most of the compact layout, a sofa bed or daybed—similar to those in Escape’s Vista models—would be a practical choice, offering both seating and a sleeping area without overcrowding the interior. This flexible approach lets you tailor the home to your needs, ensuring comfort and functionality while maintaining the open feel of the space. With some thoughtful furnishing, the Nook can easily become a cozy and efficient tiny house retreat. The Nook is available for purchase at $39,900 and can be shipped anywhere in the US, with international delivery possible for those willing to manage extra port-related costs and logistics. For buyers interested in sustainable living, Custom Container Living offers optional off-grid upgrades, such as solar panels, which can enhance flexibility and independence, though these additions will raise the overall price. Whether you’re seeking a simple getaway or a compact full-time home, The Nook presents a ready-to-ship, customizable option designed to fit a range of lifestyles and locations. This tiny home offers a smart, budget-friendly solution for modern tiny living. Its compact design, efficient layout, and customizable options make it ideal for those seeking simplicity and flexibility. With off-grid upgrades available, The Nook is a versatile choice for anyone looking to embrace a minimalist lifestyle in style.",
