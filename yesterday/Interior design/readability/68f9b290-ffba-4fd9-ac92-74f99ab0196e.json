We’re living in a world where pocket-sized wonders connect us to everything humanity has ever created, yet unboxing these marvels can feel like opening a pack of bland stationery. Unboxing videos which were once the highlight of every tech youtuber’s career is now practically an afterthought. Why? Companies have ruined unboxing experiences to prioritize profits. You’d get chargers, earphones, cases, screen protectors, and sometimes even brand stickers (looking at you, Apple) inside smartphone boxes. Now, merely a phone and if you’re lucky, a braided cable. Designer Andrea Copellino has a solution to fix this problem – Bring back excitement, curiosity, and storytelling to technology using trading cards. Yes, trading cards. And it’s not as random as it sounds. It’s the perfect intersection of nostalgia, storytelling, and fun. Designer: Andrea Copellino To demonstrate this, Copellino chooses tech startup Nothing to demonstrate this idea. Nothing, a tech brand with a quirky ethos of transparency and an obsession with reintroducing joy into technology, is exactly the kind of company that could pull this off. Their design language already reads like a conversation with an old friend: clear materials that show the guts of the product, a marketing team that doesn’t mind poking fun at itself, and a YouTube channel where their designers casually break down creative decisions. It’s approachable and refreshingly human. But Francesco and his collaborator Francesco (yes, another Francesco), think the brand could do even more. They believe Nothing’s biggest untapped potential is right there in the unboxing experience. Now, unboxing isn’t typically a topic that gets pulses racing, but it’s where Francesco’s storytelling brilliance shines. He’s reimagining unboxing as a chance to weave narrative into the very first interaction you have with a product. Instead of the usual manuals and filler paper, Francesco envisions collectible trading cards tucked into Nothing’s products. Imagine this: you open your new earbuds, and alongside them is a sleek card adorned with abstract art that hints at the product’s creative inspiration. Flip it over, and there’s a short story about the quirky origins of the design—like how pharmaceutical packaging inspired the bubble-like Ear (A) case. These cards aren’t just gimmicks. They’re thoughtfully crafted artifacts. Each card would feature high-quality illustrations, metadata like product names and release dates, and captivating anecdotes. Even the card’s material and packaging echo Nothing’s aesthetic: semi-transparent paper, subtle textures, and a pierced detail that nods to their love for transparency. The goal isn’t just to inform but to delight. It’s tactile, personal, and—most importantly—memorable. And the brilliance of this idea? It’s collectible. Francesco’s design aligns perfectly with how Nothing already connects with its audience. The company actively invites its community to participate in its creative process, from forums to YouTube comment sections. These cards could take that engagement to the next level. Imagine Nothing hosting design contests where fans create illustrations for the cards or special edition collectibles handed out at launch events. It’s a way to keep the community invested without the logistical nightmares of overly ambitious projects like Nothing’s Community Edition Phone. But Francesco’s concept goes even deeper. Trading cards tap into something bigger than tech; they tap into culture. Millennials and Gen Z grew up with Pokémon cards, Magic: The Gathering, and other collectible phenomena. The resurgence of physical trading cards, fueled by their nostalgic and tactile appeal, isn’t slowing down. Francesco sees these cards as an opportunity to blend Nothing’s bold industrial design with the emotional pull of cherished childhood memories. It’s a way to bridge the cold utility of tech with the warmth of human experience. And it’s practical too. The cards don’t rely on apps, servers, or any digital infrastructure—they’re yours forever. No subscriptions. No updates. Just a simple piece of art and story that fits perfectly in your hand (or a Pokémon binder, for those inclined). Even better, they’re scalable. Every Nothing device could come with a unique card, offering a new piece of the brand’s story to collectors with each purchase. It’s an idea that feels premium but doesn’t break the bank. The most exciting part? This idea could redefine how we think about unboxing. Instead of it being an afterthought, it becomes an event—a chance to connect with the product and its creators on a deeper level. Francesco’s trading cards aren’t about adding unnecessary fluff; they’re about reminding us that technology isn’t just functional. It’s personal. It has stories, quirks, and, thanks to Nothing, a sense of humor. Nothing’s ethos is rooted in challenging conventions, and Francesco’s trading card concept feels like an extension of that mission. It’s a bold, fun, and slightly eccentric idea that fits seamlessly into their brand DNA. It would be fun if Nothing entertained the concept – there’s really little to lose given how simple the execution is with something as basic as a trading card. At least it’ll revive the unboxing experience, turning it into something that has a little touch of intrigue and suspense… and everyone loves a little suspense, right?",
