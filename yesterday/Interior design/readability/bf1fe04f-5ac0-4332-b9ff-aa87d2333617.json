  "text": "No escape key on the real-life severance keyboardAtomic Keyboard creates a real-life Severance-inspired keyboard with a trackball and a missing Escape key. Inspired by the Data General ‘Dasher’ Terminal in the ’70s and ’80s, the modern creation named MDR Dasher has 73 keys in total. It comes without any Escape, Control, and Options keys. A dark blue backdrop covers the main body of the Severance keyboard. Then, from an angle, it’s evidently visible that the device is slightly raised. The borders are also chunky and dirty white, contrasting the blue shades of the main body.The main buttons are in a lighter shade of blue, while the rest of the keys have a darker hue. Only the arrows are present in the number pad, centered like a cross on the right side. The trackball, a replacement for the traditional mouse and a signature of the Severance keyboard, sits next to the number pad. So far, the real-life recreation of the device is underway. Atomic Keyboard has already set its pre-launch list for the the Severance-inspired keyboard.all images courtesy of Atomic Keyboard70 percent compact design ratio, just like in the showThe keyboard featured in the Apple TV+ series Severance takes after the original Data General Dasher terminal keyboards produced in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Dasher devices are distinctive for their appearance, unconventional key layout, and sturdy build. In the TV show, the production team reimagines these devices to create the fictional workstations used by employees in the Macrodata Refinement (MDR) department at Lumon Industries. A recreation of a recreation is what comes next when Atomic Keyboard steps in. The team redevelops the Severance keyboard from the show, set to make it available to select people to bring out the Innie and Outie in them. The recreation uses an aluminum case, and its layout even follows a 70 percent compact design ratio, just like in the show. The real-life Severance keyboard also features custom-designed keycaps. It also connects through USB-C, supporting compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. So far, the team has opened the sign-up pool for the pre-launch of its limited-run Severance keyboard.Atomic Keyboard creates a real-life Severance-inspired keyboardit comes with a trackball and a missing Escape keythe modern creation has 73 keys in total and comes without any Escape, Control, and Options keysa dark blue backdrop covers the main body of the Severance keyboardthe keyboard design takes after the original Data General Dasher terminal keyboardsthe recreation uses an aluminum case, and its layout even follows a 70 percent compact design ratio",
