  "description": "After being priced out of the coastal suburbs on Melbourne’s Mornington Peninsula, architect and interior designer Elise Jeffree (ae architects) came across this 1960s shack in Frankston South. It was a true fixer-upper. But it was still near the beach and within their budget — leaving Elise and her husband with about $235,000 to spend on the renovation. With help from her brother (a builder), the old shack has been transformed into a new dream home fit for their young family.",

  "text": "In the hunt for her own family home, ae architects co-founder Elise Jeffree had a clear wishlist. ‘I wanted something charming with a bit of character we could renovate. I also wanted to be close to the beach,’ Elise says, having grown up on the Mornington Peninsula. ‘After looking for six months or so, [my husband and I] concluded that the price bracket we were looking in wasn’t going to allow us to eat, let alone renovate. So, I adjusted my expectations and found a shack two blocks outside of the desired radius.’ Located in Frankston South, the 1960s abode was in disrepair. Rotten weatherboards, deteriorating interiors, and the inefficient floorplan left much to be desired. ‘The skillion roof was the only redeeming design feature,’ Elise admits. And most importantly, it was priced within the family’s budget. Elise was conscious to get the thumbs up from her frequent collaborator and brother Simon — the builder behind SGR Construction — who was overseas at the time she bought the home. ‘Real estate photos didn’t really convey to him the actual state of disrepair and extent of the renovation,’ she says. ‘Reality hit when he returned home and saw what he had agreed to. Typically, only building new high-end homes in Sorrento, this renovation for Simon was a literal labour of love.’ ‘Once we started opening the shack up, we came across asbestos, joists floating above stumps, concrete slabs under the carpet that were 20mm higher than the existing floorboards… but with my brother holding my hand, nothing seemed too daunting.’ The redesign also focused on reconfiguring the floor plan, adding a new bedroom and bathroom to the rear of the home without expanding the existing footprint. Meanwhile, moving the kitchen to the centre created what Elise playfully calls the ‘panopticon’, allowing her to keep a watchful eye on her young kids, whether they are playing in the front or backyard. This practical yet creative approach characterised the look of the interiors too. Stainless steel benchtops and blue joinery add a modern edge to the house’s retro form, as exposed red-brick walls have been painted white. Outside, new bluestone crazy paving accents and lush native plants enhance the shack’s nostalgic vibe. Despite all the challenges, Simon got stuck into the renovation on Boxing Day 2023 and was finished within just three months. The total cost of the renovation came in at about $235,000 — only $15,000 over what Elise had originally budgeted thanks to her trade discounts and ‘extreme mates rates’ from her brother and her dad, who painted the house. ‘In return for the house we now have, it’s money well spent,’ she adds. And her advice for anyone else planning a renovation? ‘Have a brother who is a builder… My payback is imminent.’",
