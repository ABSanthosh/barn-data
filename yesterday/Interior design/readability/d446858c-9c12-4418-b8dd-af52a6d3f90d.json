  "text": "Oscar Tusquets’ Bib Luz lamp effectively illuminates books’ spinesSanta \u0026 Cole presents Bib Luz, a lamp conceived by Oscar Tusquets in 1986 to discern the books’ spines on his shelf. Spanish architect Oscar Tusquets faced the challenge of illuminating bookshelves effectively. Instead of relying on conventional methods, he designed Bib Luz, a lamp that integrates into any shelf while enhancing the visibility of book spines. Unlike traditional bookcase lighting, often placed at the back and inadequate for practical use, Tusquets’ innovative solution brought the light source forward, creating perspective and clarity.Shaped like a book, Bib Luz houses its transformer and switch within its body, from which a rigid metal arm extends vertically. At its tip, a spotlight illuminates bookshelves without casting shadows, blending utility with artistic elegance. This ingenious, poetic design approaching figurative and oneiric imagery embodies Tusquets’ avant-garde spirit and reveals the creative synergies and friendship between Salvador Dalí and the designer. In 1998, lighting designer Ingo Maurer paid tribute to Bib Luz by creating the Oskar lamp, a reinterpretation with a shorter, flexible arm and more utilitarian design. Although differing in execution and quite disconnected from the book metaphor, Maurer’s homage highlighted the originality and influence of Tusquets’ design.all images by Coke Bartrina unless stated otherwiseSanta \u0026 Cole presents a new edition of Bib Luz lampReflecting on the design’s philosophy, Tusquets explains:‘If I place a lamp on a shelf, all the lower ones remain in shadow. Only by bringing the light source forward can I illuminate all the spines of the books. I then have a body with a stem and a small bulb at its tip. The body, which houses the transformer and the switch, must be able to be positioned anywhere on the shelf, take up little space, and go unnoticed. What can I imagine better than a book?’Global publisher of design objects, art, and books, Santa \u0026 Cole now presents a definitive edition of Bib Luz, conceived by architect Oscar Tusquets, incorporating modern improvements while preserving its original poetic essence. Featuring two finishes—off-white and aluminum grey—and an updated LED light source, the lamp ensures superior optics and energy efficiency. The metallic arm clicks easily into place, offering adjustable illumination. For added flexibility, multiple units can be connected in series using a single wall plug, enabling stunning compositions across various shelf levels. The updated design delivers precise, non-dazzling lighting that highlights bookshelves while maintaining a minimal visual footprint.Santa \u0026 Cole presents Bib Luz, a lamp conceived by Oscar Tusquets to illuminate the books’ spines effectivelyBib Luz integrates into any shelf, bringing light forward to enhance visibility with clarity and precisionshaped like a book, Bib Luz combines functionality and artistry, housing its transformer and switch within its bodya rigid metal arm extends vertically from Bib Luz, ending in a spotlight that illuminates without casting shadowsTusquets’ innovative design brought the light source outside the shelf, solving the issue of poorly lit bookshelves",
