  "text": "Called the Mini Dome, this is the world’s first pentakis dodecahedron (60-sided) tiny home. It is a geodesic dome home that has been created to maximize the limited space, serving as a unique vacation rental. The pint-sized little house will be available for sale in bare hub kit form too. Geodesic domes were initially popularized by the architect Buckminster Fuller, and they comprise interconnected triangles. The domes are often preferred by hobbyists for greenhouses and eco-homes. This little dome was designed by Dodeca Domes’ Joshua Tulberg, and it includes a welded steel hub and wooden struts. It is supported by an elevated pier and beam foundation and also features great insulation. Designer: Joshua Tulberg of Dodeca Domes The interior of the dome occupies around 308 sq ft, and it spans over two floors. It has a pretty open layout, with a front door leading to the main living area. The living area is equipped with triangular windows, and the interior of the home is pretty attractive with a unique shape. The layout is cleverly designed to accommodate the curving walls, and it contains a sofa bed and a dining table for two people. A central section functions as the kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. It also includes a TV. The kitchen is amped with a fridge/freezer, sink, coffee maker, microwave, toaster, and some cabinetry. While the bathroom includes a shower and a toilet. The bedroom can be accessed via a space-saving spiral staircase, and it is essentially a simple mezzanine with a queen-sized bed. There is plenty of space to stand upright as well. The Mini Dome is up for rent on Airbnb, and Tulberg is planning to sell the bare hub kit for US$15,000 in 2025.",
