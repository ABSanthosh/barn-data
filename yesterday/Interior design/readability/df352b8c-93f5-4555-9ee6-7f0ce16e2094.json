The new lineup introduces the Osmo Mobile 7P and Osmo Mobile 7, bringing the seventh-generation DJI stabilization technology and the company’s most advanced ActiveTrack 7.0. Designed for creators at every level, the new gimbals offer a range of intelligent features to enhance smartphone filmmaking and photography. Designer: DJI Ferdinand Wolf, Product Experience Director at DJI, emphasized the brand’s commitment to pushing creative camera technology forward. “From award-winning filmmakers to short-form content creators, DJI continues to expand our ecosystem of creative camera technologies and push the industry forward,” said Wolf. “With the Osmo Mobile 7 Series’ latest advances in intelligent tracking and camera stabilization, capturing beautiful, professional content with a smartphone has never been easier.” Osmo Mobile 7 The Osmo Mobile 7P builds on the success of the Osmo Mobile 6, maintaining a lightweight and portable design while adding a more powerful three-axis stabilizer. The newly introduced Multifunctional Module integrates light control with adjustable color temperatures and brightness levels, ensuring versatile shooting capabilities. The module also serves as a microphone receiver, allowing high-quality audio transmission while simultaneously providing extra power via its USB-C connection. With quick one-step unfolding, an integrated extension rod, and a built-in tripod, the Osmo Mobile 7P is engineered for convenience and efficiency. Osmo Mobile 7P The Osmo Mobile 7 offers similar design elements but in a more compact and entry-level package. Weighing approximately 10 ounces (300g), it stands as the lightest gimbal in its class. It supports the same quick unfolding, built-in tripod, and one-step storage for easy portability. The Multifunctional Module is compatible with the Osmo Mobile 7 as a separate add-on, allowing users to expand their creative toolkit. The Multifunctional Module enhances subject tracking by utilizing a smartphone’s native camera, live streaming apps, and other camera applications. With accurate focus maintenance, the module ensures smooth and precise tracking, even in crowded environments. Its magnetic clip attachment makes it easy to integrate with the gimbal, while hand gesture controls offer intuitive operation. Users can trigger tracking by showing their palm, taking a photo with a “V” gesture, or adjusting framing with a “Double L” gesture. These controls streamline the user experience, enabling hands-free shooting in dynamic settings. Osmo Mobile 7P ActiveTrack 7.0, DJI’s most advanced tracking system to date, enhances the Osmo Mobile 7 Series by automatically adjusting to track subjects fluidly. When paired with the DJI Mimo app, the gimbal can detect multiple subjects, allowing users to lock onto a primary focus or switch between subjects with a single tap. The technology ensures smooth tracking, even when subjects are moving quickly or momentarily obscured from view. This advanced feature benefits content creators capturing action-packed scenes or fast-paced vlogs where traditional stabilization might struggle. Additional features further expand creative possibilities. A side wheel offers precise control over zoom and focus, allowing smooth focal adjustments for cinematic compositions. A long press of the wheel enables fill light adjustments, making it easy to modify brightness and color temperature without additional equipment. Compatibility with the Apple Watch introduces a smart remote control function via the DJI Mimo app, allowing users to operate the gimbal and camera feed directly from their wrist. With up to 10 hours of battery life, the Osmo Mobile 7 Series is built to handle extended shooting sessions without interruption. Osmo Mobile 7P DJI has opened orders for the Osmo Mobile 7 Series, available through store.dji.com and authorized retail partners, with immediate shipping. The Osmo Mobile 7P is priced at $149, while the Osmo Mobile 7 is available for $89. A range of accessories is also available, including the DJI OM Magnetic Quick-Release Mount, DJI Mic Mini Transmitter, DJI OM 7 Series Tracking Kit, and the DJI OM Grip Tripod. These accessories extend the gimbal’s versatility, catering to different filming needs and setups. Osmo Mobile 7 To help users protect their investment, DJI Care Refresh is now available for the Osmo Mobile 7P and Osmo Mobile 7. The protection plan covers accidental damage, including natural wear, collisions, and water exposure. Users opting for the one-year plan receive up to two replacements, while the two-year plan extends coverage to four replacements. The program includes additional benefits such as an official warranty, international service support, and free shipping for covered incidents. Osmo Mobile 7 The DJI Osmo Mobile 7 Series is a big step forward in smartphone stabilization, combining top-tier gimbal technology with smart AI tracking and controls. By improving its ActiveTrack system, adding better gesture recognition, and making it easy to use with smartphones, DJI keeps leading the way in handheld camera stabilization. Packed with professional features at a price that delivers real value, the Osmo Mobile 7 Series is an essential tool for content creators who want high-end performance without spending a fortune.",
