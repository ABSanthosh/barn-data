Is it hot where you live? It sure is in SC. It’s not just a July heatwave, but an entire summer so far heatwave on steroids – which makes it hard to enjoy doing much outside between the hours of 9AM – 7PM. One way Ed and I have been beating the heat has been taking advantage of half-priced Tuesdays at the movie theater. It is so cold in the theaters sometimes that you need to bring a sweater or a blanket to stay warm…. which I do. Ed just rolls his eyes at me when I bring my movie throw blanket with me. I make sure to point out to him that I am not the only one who does this. I see many others heading into the theater with blankets and throws, just like the couple sitting next to me this past Tuesday. Each of them had a colorful crocheted throw covering them up. This past week we saw Superman. If you haven’t seen it, it has a great storyline with heart. I thought it was well done and enjoyed it all the way until the last of the credits scrolled by. How about you – do you bring a sweater or blanket to the movie theater in the summer months so you don’t freeze while watching a movie? Now onto the links I found for you this week.
