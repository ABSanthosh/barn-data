  "text": "flover and crosby studios bring life to discarded botanicalsCrosby Studios and floral design studio Flover present Flower Room, a one-day installation staged inside a private townhouse in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Conceived by Crosby founder Harry Nuriev, the project invited visitors into a fleeting environment where industrial materials and botanical fragments coexist to shape a sculptural silver capsule.At the center of the installation stands a reflective structure made entirely from aluminum barbecue trays, a recurring material in Nuriev’s work. The silver-toned capsule, previously introduced in his Paris gallery, was filled with the byproducts of floral arrangement including discarded petals, bouquet scraps, and loose blooms arranged in buckets. These remnants, often overlooked in traditional floral displays, were placed in full view around a central table that seems to be discovered mid-use, lending the space a suspended, work-in-progress quality.Crosby Studios and Flover create a one-night installation in Williamsburg | image © Pauline Shapirocelebrating the ephemera of floristryFlover brings its distinctive approach to its collaboration with Crosby Studios by layering the interior with sculptural floral compositions.
