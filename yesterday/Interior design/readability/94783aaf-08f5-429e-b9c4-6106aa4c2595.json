It's crunchy and sweet and has...ramen noodles! Weird, right? Hang in there, I promise it's so good!! As I age I find I like more foods. Do you find the same? I don't know if my tastes have matured over time, or that I'm just trying more foods than I used to. Up till a few years ago I didn't even like avocado -- now I could eat it with a spoon.  I actually avoided this salad at first because I didn't like most of the ingredients. Everyone raved about it though, so I had to give it a try. It was all over then...I hoarded the rest of it for myself and couldn't get enough. :) So I knew I had to share it with you! After some searching I realized this is a very popular recipe, but can vary quite a bit. It's a perfect dish for picnics or get togethers, especially in the warmer months.  This ramen salad is cold and crunchy and full of flavor: It's very quick and easy to put together! As usual, I have some edits and thoughts on the ingredients, so stay tuned.  Here's the list of ingredients:  Easy Ramen Noodle Slaw Salad 2 packages chicken ramen noodle soup mix 1 lb cole slaw mix 1 pkg broccoli slaw 1 cup sunflower seeds small bunch green onions, chopped Dressing:  1 cup vegetable oil 1/2 cup sugar 1/3 cup rice vinegar 2 chicken ramen seasoning packets I mixed the cole slaw and broccoli slaw together first:  I couldn't find actual broccoli slaw, so I used a bagged broccoli salad instead. I didn't include all of the broccoli and chopped up what I did use.  Then I mixed in the sunflower seeds and chopped onion:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  The awesome crunch in this salad comes from the sunflower seeds and the ramen. (You can see a few cranberries that were in the seeds from the salad mix I used.) I put the noodles in a baggy and then pounded them up a bit:  The bag is helpful for another reason that I'll share in a minute. Hold off on adding the ramen till the end. Mix up the dressing -- I tried using less sugar than the 1/2 cup at first, but after tasting it I used the full 1/2 cup.  I only used one ramen chicken seasoning packet just to cut down on the sodium. It tasted just as good with the one!  Mix it all together and ENJOY the light, sweet, crunchiness of this delicious salad!:  This salad is perfect for a big get together, especially in the spring and summer. So light and fresh and also sweet and savory.  I make this for me (my family won't touch it, even though I KNOW THEY'D LOVE IT) and I keep the extra for later. I like the crunch of the ramen, so I keep that out until I eat the salad. It's probably a good idea to leave the sunflower seeds out until you eat as well. If you are making this for a big group, I'd leave the seeds and ramen out till right before you serve. Or you can add them and then add the dressing right before serving.  I should mention that I don't like cole slaw or broccoli, and sunflower seeds are not an item I'd reach for...but I LOVE this salad. It is SO dang fresh and yummy.  Have you tried this ramen noodle salad? Am I the last to this party?  Some random cranberries made it into mine because I used the sunflower seeds from the bagged salad. Cranberries would be a lovely addition to this salad!
