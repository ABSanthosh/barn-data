  "text": "This Post May Contain Affiliate Links. Please Read Our Disclosure Policy here This post is in partnership with Wayfair I’ll admit it. Our Snug has always been a “catchall” room. This past week I finally took the time to get this room pulled together. I did some decluttering, rearranged a couple of pieces we already had and found a few items at Wayfair to add function and style. There’s lots more I want to do over time, but as always, we embrace BABY STEPS! Let me show you around. This room has been a little challenging to arrange because we had a lot of furniture, the shape is long and narrow and the room has to serve a lot of purposes. But I think I’ve finally figured out what will work for us so I feel we’re on the right track. I also identified a few “missing pieces” that I knew would make this room feel cozier and less like an afterthought. Here’s what I found at Wayfair: Checkered lampshade and lamp on deskChinoiserie lampBotanical artStorage end tableTwo pillows (One // Two)Jute rugMetal Task Floor Lamp Wayfair always has cute cottage style pieces that seem to complement my style and home, too. With Black Friday coming up it’s a good time to shop for deals, your home and the holidays! I hope you enjoy all the photos and this little update on The Snug. I’m always a fan of using what we have. The books on our bookcase in this room are the books I wrote! It’s kind of fun to decorate with them because I use this room as my office too. We didn’t have an end table for this side of the couch so I was pleased to find this one. It’s a nice deep shade of navy blue and it has plenty of surface space and storage. Plus there are electrical plugs and USB sockets built in on the top so you can plug in phones and lamps, etc. So handy! This week I’m going to decide what will go in here. So many possibilities, with a moveable shelf it will work for many different options. This jute rug works great to bring together furniture we already had. I fell in love with this set of botanical art to create a focal point on the couch wall. It comes in a set of six, we used five of them here. The whole set is really beautiful, the art has a vintage feel. I love the mats (herringbone fabric) and the beaded brass frames. They come ready to hang, too, which is very convenient. The lamps also really added personality as well as LIGHT for these upcoming dark days. I love this one on the desk! This one is so classic and pretty in a blue and white Chinoisserie. Also I noticed it has birds on it! I always prefer pharmacy lamps for reading so this lamp is perfect for this side of the couch. It can raise and lower, too. The two pillows on the couch also are new (this one and this one), I like the neutral blues and greens with a lot of texture. Finnegan also adds coziness. :) I love turning on the lamps this time of year. It’s a comforting ritual before dinner.
