  "text": "Style: Cosy English Traditional Color Combination: Sage green, cream, warm brass, natural botanicals Who is it for: For families who want a living space that feels both polished and genuinely liveable. The parents who host book clubs and Sunday roasts, but also need somewhere the kids can sprawl with homework. Those who appreciate English country charm without the fuss of antiques. Budget: $ Cosy English Family Room: Board with Shopping List Below, we present a curated list of products presented on the board: Tips and suggestions Colors that Work Together: Sage green is having its moment, and for good reason—it’s sophisticated without being stuffy. The paneled accent wall in this muted green creates instant architecture, while cream upholstery keeps things light and airy. Those brass accents add warmth without the maintenance headaches of copper or the coldness of chrome. Wall details: The board-and-batten paneling is classic English country, but scaled for modern living. It adds texture and visual weight without overwhelming the space. The brass sconces flanking the botanical print create perfect symmetry, and that simple gold frame keeps the artwork from competing with the wall treatment. Furniture Foundation: The cream tufted sofa with brass nailhead trim strikes the perfect balance—formal enough for grown-up entertaining, comfortable enough for family movie nights. That matching accent chair creates a conversation area without blocking traffic flow, and the brass legs tie everything together visually. Lighting: Those swing-arm brass sconces are both beautiful and functional—perfect for reading without casting shadows. The warm metal finish complements the sofa’s brass details, creating a cohesive look that feels intentional rather than matchy. Finishing Touches: The white flowering branches in both floor and table planters bring life to the space without the commitment of fresh flowers. That textured area rug grounds the seating area and adds another layer of cosy texture underfoot. The Final Note: This room works because it embraces the English love of comfort without sacrificing style. The sage green feels fresh and current, while the traditional elements—the paneling, the botanical art, the brass details—give it staying power. It’s elegant enough for entertaining but relaxed enough for real family life, which is exactly what a family room should be.",
