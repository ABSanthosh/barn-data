  "text": "Thanks for stopping by for this week’s Style Scouting. My Sunday post where I share the random stuff that captured my attention or inspired me that I found online. After all the painting I did last weekend at my daughter’s house, it feels nice being home this weekend and relaxing on our lakeside deck under a big 11′ wide Costco market style umbrella that we have had for over 15 years. It is still going strong! We bought it for the patio around the pool we had at our previous home. Gotta love Costco!!! It rained here a lot this past week so everything is green and today the sun is shining creating diamonds on the lake’s surface. There is a nice breeze coming off the lake which is making for one very lovely day. The kind you wish happened every day. Soon enough it will be 98 degrees and humid, so I am going to enjoy just hanging out with no agenda at all the rest of the weekend. That is a rare thing for me. It feels good. :-) I hope you are having a nice weekend. Now onto the links I found for you this week.
