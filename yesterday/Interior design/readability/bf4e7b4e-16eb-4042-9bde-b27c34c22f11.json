The space is not just an exhibition room but a comfortable, multi-purpose area for discovery, sharing, and interaction, reflecting the brand’s values and focus on high-quality tailored ceramic solutions that meet people’s desire for uniqueness.the FAB showroom brings together ceramic collections, events, and playful design | all images courtesy of FiandreDYNAMIC LAYOUT BRINGS TOGETHER PRODUCTS AND EVENTSThe restyling project, which began in 2023, includes an extension to 2,300 sqm, flooded with natural light to enhance the relationship between the interior spaces and its surrounding nature. The concept by Area 17 accompanies the ceramic company’s needs by creating a vital and transformable facility, emphasizing versatility for hosting events, exhibitions, and product interpretation. ‘We conceived FAB as a dynamic organism, a container of experiences and emotions, ready to welcome visitors, entertain them and cultivate relationships we developed a design that could facilitate the interpretation of products and suggest their use, but which could also be flexible for hosting events and exhibitions following the company’s strong, innovative pace,’ explains Federico Gigetti, Partner Senior Architect at Area 17.the restyling projects unveils a multi-purpose area for discovery, sharing, and interactionPLAYFUL INTERACTIONS WITH CERAMIC SURFACESThe central area of the redesigned FAB showroom features an articulated internal square under a large glass ceiling, creating dynamic perspectives with architectural volumes that showcase Fiandre’s ceramic collections arranged in a continuous dialogue of colors, shades, patterns and luminous textures. Tribute100, a revival of Fiandre’s historic Serie 100, takes center stage with its versatile and decorative potential, creating an immersive lounge for visitors.Adding a playful twist to the facility, the reception area doubles as a bar, offering a more relaxed, informal atmosphere for visitors. Drawing from retail design, Fiandre’s ceramic surfaces are displayed in food-inspired formats, where material samples are arranged like gourmet sandwiches packaged away in special boxes, allowing visitors to ‘grab \u0026 go.’ The full-body ceramic products presented in freezers as if they were ice creams further enhance the playful design, adding a whimsical touch to the experience.material samples are creatively displayed in food-inspired formats, offering an engaging experience for visitorsA sculptural arcade, another highlight of the space, invites visitors to explore the various exhibition rooms, showcases, and niches. These areas provide deeper insights into Fiandre’s ceramic collections, such as the Hypertouch® smart surfaces and the DYS (Design Yours Slabs) customization technique. This arcade serves as a central architectural element, connecting all parts of the showroom.Beyond the visual experience, the showroom offers functionality with a flexible corporate meeting space that can seat up to 100 people. The terraces surrounding this area open towards the bar through an automatic curtain system, extending the space for hospitality, gatherings, and collaborative work. Area 17’s design concept skillfully blends work, interaction, and leisure, ensuring the FAB showroom meets the demands of professional and creative events.",
