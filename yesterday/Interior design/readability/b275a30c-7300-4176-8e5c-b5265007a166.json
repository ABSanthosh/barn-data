  "text": "Thanks for stopping by for this week’s Style Scouting. My Sunday post where I share the random stuff that captured my attention or inspired me that I found online. Now that April is only two days away, this is the time of year I always enjoy getting to say… “April showers bring May flowers“. I even found a decorating idea for you this week that is in line with the saying. I am hoping that all the showers that will be coming (we need the rain here in SC) will remove all the pollen that has covered everything over the last two weeks. Once the yellow powder is gone, I can start getting my outdoor spaces set-up and colorful flowers planted in the planters on the deck. On project notes, this past week I finished the cabinet I was stripping. It came out better than I thought it would. I will share the after this week along with another post about something I got for my living room. It is such a simple thing, but brings the furnishings I have in the room together. :-) Now onto the links I found for you this week. Something to Think About If you have worries on your mind, try adding a worry window to your day. (open in same tab) “Never be afraid to let someone know if they brightened the room they just walked into. Or if something they said inspired you to change. … Say it. Always say it.” – Donna Ashworth If you enjoy these posts – You can find past Style Scouting posts here.
