This collection revives the 45,000-year-old practice of using natural tree sap as a wood binder, eliminating the need for synthetic glues. The collection, made from cedar and aluminum, includes a dining chair, armchair, wall sconce, floor lamp, and table lamp. Hand-carved wooden dowels crafted from offcuts replace modern fasteners, windfallen trees are harvested instead of logging, and salvaged metal is repurposed rather than sourcing new materials.all images by James HanSALVAGE \u0026 SAP Revives Ancient CraftsmanshipNatural construction techniques honor the resourcefulness of past cultures, emphasizing the value of repurposing and reworking resources thoughtfully.
