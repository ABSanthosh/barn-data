  "text": "This Post May Contain Affiliate Links. Please Read Our Disclosure Policy here Thank you all for the warm welcome to our new pup Finnegan. It’s been a little wild adjusting to life with a puppy again, but he is even more precious than we could have imagined. There is no doubt in our mind, he was the pup for us. Sources: Basket Dog Bed // Fur Dog Bed // Room Sources Finnegan has spent his first couple of weeks here learning the rhythms of our home and finding his way around. He is figuring out where he should go potty (if you need a good steam cleaner, this one has been a life saver LOL! I shared more about it here) and how to get up on the ottoman without falling off the other side ha! He is determined to climb stairs and wants to do all the things Lily can do. Finnegan is hilarious! We laugh so much. He loves watch TV with us in the evenings (he is SO CUDDLY!) and train for treats and play with all of the toys. Best of all, he made a friend. Lily wasn’t so sure what to make of this little guy who just showed up unexpectedly in her home. But she slowly warmed up to the idea of him being a part of our family. A week ago she became amused by his antics. Then over the past week she started started playing with him (running around the house and yard!). Now she looks forward to seeing him in the morning and enjoys all of the adventures they have together. They’ve gone on walks around the neighborhood and our town and even explore the beach together. It’s the sweetest thing to see. Lily is HAPPY! Happier than we ever imagined she would be. Her tail wags all the time when he’s near and she actually plays more than we’ve ever seen. Lily never had a puppy of her own until now — she’s thriving and loving every minute of it. And Finnegan is happy, too.
