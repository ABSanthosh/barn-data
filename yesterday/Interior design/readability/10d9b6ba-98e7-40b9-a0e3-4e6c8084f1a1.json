  "text": "There’s something so captivating about a space that balances drama with restraint. In the Traditional Minimalist Apartment—designed by Paliychuk Olga—we see how bold meets refined. We do see a muted palette and clean lines dominating the space. But simultaneously, this space is a masterclass in contrast. From deep, sultry hues to sleek black finishes, this moody minimalist apartment embraces a less-is-more philosophy. The result? A space that feels effortlessly chic! The living room sticks to a neutral color palette with beige walls. It adds visual interest with accent hues. These can be seen through the plush olive green sectional sofa and curtains. A dark gray accent chair complements the dark gray paint and shelving—acting as the sleek entertainment complex. Together, these design features add pops of color. The windows are large, allowing natural light to flood in. A shiny gold coffee table diversifies textures while adding luxury. In the hallway toward the back of the living area, we see matte black doors adding visual interest. Pendant lights illuminate the compact hallway, while the cylindrical mirror at the end opens up the space. At the back of the living space is the open-floor kitchen and dining. Here, gray tiles are used for the floor as well as backsplash. Their horizontal and vertical lines instantly add visual interest. In the center, a matte black wooden dining table is paired with similarly-hued chairs. The kitchen itself is lined with black cabinetry, tying the space together. We love the gold faucet and sleek rod pendant light factoring in luxury. This is paired with a large window without any treatments and smaller spotlights on the ceiling. Finally, large oversized plants add life to the space. The bedroom is an affair of beige and black. The walls are two-toned, using beige for the upper part. The lower part—aligned with the black workstation and bed—is darker-hued. A minimalist bookshelf sitting low to the floor allows plenty of room to store books. Nearby, an oversized potted plant is illuminated with natural light entering from the window. This bathroom is as moody and sophisticated as it gets! Maroon tiling is paired with a darker-hued marble. A toilet and bidet, as well as the sleek double vanity, make sure the space is as functional as is stylish. The lighting fixtures are strategically highlighting just the right design elements. This bathroom, on the other hand, uses peach tiling and white marble. The dark vanity factors in a stunning contrast.",
