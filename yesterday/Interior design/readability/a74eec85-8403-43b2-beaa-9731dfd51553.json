  "text": "UNDER $300 Feeling generous this year? Help your loved ones invest in a home refresh with quality pieces like Citta’s Miro Cushion Cover. The handwoven, patchwork-like pattern and calming tones will make a subtle statement in any room. Or, maybe the playful Aura Mirror from father-daughter design brand Middle Of Nowhere will inspire them to restyle their white walls over the summer break. The Picnic Mat by Terra Bloom is another crowd-pleasing pressie. Made from a water-resistant fabric with a squishy foam lining, it’s a must-have for the beach, park, or next camping trip. We also have our eyes on the IXIA Vase by Melbourne florist Hattie Molloy. It’s one of those rare pieces that everyone from your boyfriend to your best friend would appreciate.
