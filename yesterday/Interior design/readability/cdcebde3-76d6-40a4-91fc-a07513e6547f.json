  "text": "The Carbon MORPHEUS is so sleek and streamlined its wind-tunnel test is probably just a bunch of parallel lines. Designed by EPTA, this mid-engine two-seater supercar skips nostalgia and dives straight into aggressive futurism. It looks engineered by a design studio that sees speed not as a metric, but as a shape. The design brief? “Design is the language of dreams.” Which sounds poetic until you realize what they’ve dreamt up could moonlight as a Batmobile in a Nolan film – just sharper, lower, and probably too dangerous for even Bruce Wayne. A manifesto of Italian elegance, they call it. But it leans more toward brutalist cyberpunk with a splash of Lamborghini’s wild DNA and a whisper of Bertone-era silhouette language. That tapered greenhouse? Pure retro-futurism, the kind that could only come from a country that worships both speed and sculpture in equal measure. Designer: EPTA Design The bodywork is entirely carbon fiber, and not just as a flex. The weave is visible from every angle, wrapping around exaggerated wheel arches and angry origami-like creases. It’s not just aesthetics either – it’s structure, soul, and statement. The reflections rolling off the surface are almost liquid, a high-gloss hallucination of light and intent. Look closely and you’ll see the word “VEPTA” near the front wheels, perhaps a clue or a red herring in EPTA Design’s growing mythos. Around the back, things get wild. Four vertical exhausts erupt from a tail section that looks like a spaceship’s afterburner array. There’s no wing, but the rear deck itself swoops like it’s ready to generate lift – or downforce, depending on how many laws of physics it’s trying to bend. A golden center-lock nut anchors the gloss-black wheels, which are wide, multi-spoked, and performance-obsessed. Brake calipers peek out in red, adding a splash of aggression to an otherwise stealth-fighter palette. From above, the canopy has a near-seamless wrap of glass and carbon. It’s tight. Tense. Like a jet cockpit shrunken down and perched just ahead of a carbon fiber storm. The symmetry here is clinical, the panel gaps razor-thin. It doesn’t just look fast; it looks like it was born in a vacuum chamber under military surveillance. EPTA says this is a “mid-engine two-seater supercar,” which automatically tells you what kind of proportions and intent they’re working with. But beyond the silhouette and stance, this thing is abstract sculpture on wheels. It’s less about raw specs and more about shaping emotion through velocity. And yet, it’s not lost in concept art fantasy. The presence is real, the panels are real, the reflections tell you this isn’t just a digital mockup. There’s heat coming out of those pipes in one of the rear shots. That’s combustion. That’s ambition made tactile. You don’t commit this hard to an idea unless you’re serious about chasing it into reality.",
