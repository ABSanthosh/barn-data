  "text": "Back in the day, hot rods were built in garages, not factories. They were pieced together by gearheads with a knack for mechanics and a need for speed. That same spirit is alive in this LEGO Ideas build, a remote-controlled beast that takes the classic hot rod silhouette and infuses it with the kind of technical detail that makes you want to pop the hood—if it had one. It’s a fan-made creation, but it looks like something LEGO could have released alongside their best Technic car sets. The design is a love letter to classic old T-Bucket hotrods from the early 60s, the kind built in garages with elbow grease and a little bit of recklessness. The exaggerated front end, the massive exposed engine, the bare-bones cockpit—it all screams speed in its rawest form. The builder, Meesayousa, didn’t just slap together a car shape and call it a day. This thing comes with a bare V6, a properly articulated front suspension, and exhaust pipes that snake their way under the chassis like they were hand-welded in a back-alley speed shop. The color scheme is simple—white with black trim and yellow seats—but that just makes it look even more like something pulled straight out of a custom car show. Designer: Meesayousa LEGO’s official hot rods (the Technic Hot Rod 42022, for example) tend to be static models, sometimes with basic steering or a piston function if you’re lucky. This one, on the other hand, comes with its own remote control that gets the hot rod zipping up and down your house, sending it flying down hallways and skidding around corners like a proper speed demon. “I have always wanted a driveable hotrod made from LEGO Technic, and have toyed with the idea for ages, and this week it’s finally come to fruition,” says designer Meesayousa. The car has functional steering, working pistons, and is built in modules to make construction easy. It relies on an RC receiver coupled with a train battery box, a medium motor for driving and a servo motor for the steering. Meesayousa also reinforced the build to the best of his ability, after seeing the MOC shatter to pieces every time his youngest one crashed it into a wall or a table while driving. “It’s now capable of withstanding smaller collisions without breaking apart,” adds Meesayousa. Custom LEGO builds can sometimes get messy when mixing System and Technic pieces, but this one nails the balance. The bodywork is smooth, the mechanical elements are exposed in all the right places, and nothing looks out of place. Even the cockpit, with its minimalistic seats and roll bars, fits the aesthetic perfectly. It’s a car that looks ready to tear down a desert road, leaving a cloud of dust in its wake. There’s always a question of whether builds like this could ever become official sets. LEGO Ideas has a habit of leaning toward display pieces rather than fully functional models, and the complexity of the RC system might be tricky for mass production. But if LEGO ever wanted to take a chance on an RC hot rod, this would be the blueprint. You can cast your vote for Meesayousa’s Hot Rod build on the LEGO Ideas website here!",
