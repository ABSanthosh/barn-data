  "text": "Since 2013, Calico Wallpaper has presented the finest, most immersive wall murals on the market. Their new collection is in collaboration with Kindergarten teacher and Early Childhood Educator Janene Ping. Ping, who maintains a prolific natural dyeing practice, aims to highlight the balance and beauty of nature. Teaching at the Hawthorne Valley Waldorf School for thirty years has given her the insight and sensitivity needed to foster a love for the great outdoors in our little ones. This collaboration features two distinct collections, Alchemy and Enchantment. Alchemy in Acacia The Hawthorne Valley Waldorf School is committed to providing children with the tools they need to become aware citizens. During their time, they grow a personal relationship with the natural world, and learn to become an active participant in their local economy. Handcraft and artistry is paramount, essential for humans to truly connect with the earth. Ping, a natural dyer extraordinaire, creates fantastic silk tapestries for The Magical Puppet Tree Theater – which she founded in 1992. Through this joyful medium, she uplifts a collection of fanciful stories often untold. Alchemy in Rosewood Alchemy in Marigold “The dying process reveals a journey in which the unforeseeable enchantment of color unfolds each time the fibers are lifted from the brewing vessel,” notes Ping. “The revelation of unexpected hues is the most rewarding. It’s been a wonderful opportunity and journey to explore my work on a greater scale. Seeing it come to life has been magical.” Alchemy in Vetiver Alchemy in Walnut The Alchemy collection illustrates what the beauty of hand-dyeing does so well: transparent ripples of organic colors splash across the silk, which are then translated into these wall murals. The dye is saturated by different fibers at different rates, allowing for a blooming, watercolor effect. Alchemy is available in seven colorways – Vetiver, Woad, Turmeric, Marigold, Acacia, Walnut, and Rosewood. Alchemy in Woad Enchantment in Neem Enchantment pulls upon the organic lulls and changes in tone that we find constantly in nature. One can almost make out delicate landscapes in the midst of the undulating hues, yielding softly to their neighbors. Enchantment is available in seven colorways as well – Logwood, Allium, Goldenrod, Bark, Neem, Rainbow, and Hawthorn. Enchantment in Rainbow Enchantment in Allium Enchantment in Goldenrod Enchantment in Bark “I’m grateful for the hands-on education and experiential learning that The Hawthorne Valley Waldorf School has provided to my children and the other students within the community,” shares Rachel Cope, Creative Director of Calico Wallpaper. “This inspired us to work with Janene to develop Alchemy and Enchantment, offering us an opportunity to give back to the organization that continues to support our children.” Enchantment in Logwood Enchantment in Hawthorn Calico Wallpaper was born out of the notion that art shouldn’t just live in a frame. Balancing background and foreground, texture, color, and finish is a task of endless possibility, ensuring there’s always some new discovery around the corner. Boundless and beautiful, the mesmerizing fullness of a wall mural can add incredible depth and luxury to any space, at any age.

Growing up in NYC has given Aria a unique perspective into art + design, constantly striving for new projects to get immersed in. An avid baker, crocheter, and pasta maker, handwork and personal touch is central to what she loves about the built environment. Outside of the city, she enjoys hiking, biking, and learning about space.",
