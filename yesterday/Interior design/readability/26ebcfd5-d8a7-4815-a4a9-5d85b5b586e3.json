  "text": "This sanctuary of understated elegance is designed by MONO Architects. The project combines Scandinavian design with contemporary lines. The end result is a simple yet sophisticated space that goes big on textures. We see neutral tones and natural materials coming together to bring the space to life. Really, pops of color arenâ€™t the only thing that add visual interestâ€”and a walk through this interior will show you how. The foyer is nice and open. Wooden elements and a large potted plant factor in nature, while a minimalist velvet seating area provides room to have a quick seat. In the open-floor living plan, a light oakwood dining tableâ€”paired with comfy chairsâ€”segregates the kitchen and living space on either end. A statement is created in the kitchen with a rustic island. The living room, on the other hand, sticks to minimalism with a low-profile white sofa, a large rug, and stunning artwork. The large windows give lush views of the outdoors. We also see a segregated kitchen space featuring wooden accents. This is tucked away, and so will that mess be as you cook ðŸ˜‰ This beige and white bedroom sticks to an understated palette. It factors in interest with a chunky throw and patterned rug. The circular formsâ€”as seen in the rug, nightstand, and dresserâ€”add a sense of movement to the space. The rug in this room is as chunky as it gets! The layered blankets, potted plants, and artwork further factor in texture. The compact space is made to look bigger with the floor-to-ceiling window. The warm wooden accents continue into the closet. This is layered with lightingâ€”illuminating the residentsâ€™ show-stopping pieces. The home office goes big on ergonomics with the wooden desk and spacious sofa for guests. Thereâ€™s also plenty of open shelvingâ€”and a nice and large window giving those eyes a break when theyâ€™ve been strained by the screen. Not to forget the patterned rug and massive pendant light making a statement. This bathroom keeps it sleekâ€”but adds visual interest with an orange vanity. We see a similar-shaded tint in the glass separating the shower. When looking for a relaxing moment, submerging in this freestanding bathtubâ€”placed right next to a window with boasting greenery viewsâ€”will suffice. The marble vanity single-handedly adds luxury to the space! The terracotta hues in this bathroom create a serene environment. The sleek vanity emphasizes simplicity. And the vertical slatted windows let sunshine peek through â›…",
