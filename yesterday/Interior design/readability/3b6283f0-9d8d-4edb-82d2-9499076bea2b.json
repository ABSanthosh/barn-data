Sports climbing is characterized by the use of ‘holds’—elements on climbing walls that vary in shape and size, requiring specific gripping techniques for efficient movement. Observing these holds and the ways climbers interact with them led to the conceptualization of a hanger reimagined through the lens of climbing.all images courtesy of Junho Kangclimbing holds and a perforated clothes rack shape Grip hangerGrip Hanger by creative designer Junho Kang comprises three components. The hold, a colored element inspired by climbing hold types such as jug, crimp, and pocket, offers varied visual and functional appeal. The hanger features grip shapes that mimic the techniques used to handle jug, crimp, and pocket holds, transforming the everyday act of hanging clothes into a playful, ergonomic interaction. The clothes rack, a structure inspired by the angled surfaces and perforations found in climbing gym walls, provides a versatile and functional base.The design includes practical additions such as a detachable shelf that can be affixed to the perforated sections, creating storage space for small items.
