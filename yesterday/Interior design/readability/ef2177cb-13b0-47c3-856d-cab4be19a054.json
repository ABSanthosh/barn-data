  "text": "Minimalism doesn’t have to mean monotone, and the Timberlight Interior by Bodes Studio shows us how. With its grounded palette, raw finishes, and whisper-soft textures, this home strikes the perfect balance between bold architecture and warmth. The concrete ceilings, the oak cabinetry, and the sculptural lighting—every detail is deliberate yet so calm. The foyer at Timberlight features a sculptural bench and minimalist console, adding function and form. Polished concrete floors meet vertical wood panels and sleek built-ins. Simultaneously, integrated lighting adds a subtle glow that guides the eye. The living area in Timberlight is anchored by a plush modular sofa in a smoky taupe tone. Concrete floors and exposed ceilings bring an industrial edge. This is then softened by the warm wood paneling. Two zones subtly define the space: one side centered around a chunky oak coffee table, and the other cozier, framed by a suspended fireplace and fluted wood media wall. A mature indoor olive tree adds a living touch of nature. And the organic pendant lights float above like soft sculptures. The kitchen in Timberlight is a masterclass in quiet luxury. With its matte cabinetry, integrated appliances, and layered lighting, every inch feels intentional. The palette stays true to the home’s earthy-modern language—soft wood tones meet minimalist white and concrete accents. At the heart sits a minimalist island that doubles as a prep station and social hub. A glass-lit pantry display adds a subtle glow. Meanwhile, clever storage and built-in shelving keep clutter at bay. Positioned between the kitchen and living zone, the dining space at Timberlight features a rich walnut-toned table paired with curved mid-century modern chairs. Overhead, sheer pendant lights mimic the natural form of the chairs. Just behind, the staircase doubles as an architectural feature. Floating timber steps rise between slender black railings, framed by softly lit walls. The bedroom at Timberlight is dramatic in palette, yet calming in tone. Matte black walls and ceilings create an enveloping cocoon effect. Simultaneously, built-in wood paneling adds just the right amount of warmth. A low-profile bed in deep charcoal velvet grounds the space with tactile richness, its oversized form inviting rest and stillness. Thoughtful details, like floating nightstands and minimalist pendant lights, keep the visual noise to a minimum. This light-filled bedroom in Timberlight is designed for the little ones. A cozy, scallop-edged bed adds a whimsical touch, while warm wood tones and integrated shelves keep the room feeling organized. Thoughtful touches like a floating desk, illuminated bookshelves, and a hanging swing chair make this room both functional and fun for the kids. We’d like to call it a place for learning, lounging, and letting imagination take flight. This bedroom balances calm and creativity with a plush grey bed and a light wood desk, perfect for focused study. Clean lines and ambient shelf lighting give it a polished feel, while toy models and a dotted rug keep it kid-friendly. It’s a space ready for both rest and imagination. This bathroom is all about quiet luxury. Warm wood paneling adds depth to the shower wall, contrasting beautifully with cool stone floors and a sculptural floating vanity. Dual vessel sinks and backlit mirrors elevate the everyday, while natural light pours in through a large window. This bathroom embraces simplicity with standout impact. A freestanding tub takes center stage against a dark wood accent wall. This accentuates the marble flooring. A built-in niche keeps essentials within reach, while soft natural light and matte finishes keep the mood calm and collected",
