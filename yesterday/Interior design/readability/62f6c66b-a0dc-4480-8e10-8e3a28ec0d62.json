  "description": "It takes creative foresight to look at a neglected home in need of some love and see a modern, light-filled family home. But that’s exactly what the owners of this century-old California bungalow had. Working with Melbourne architects, Architektura, they completely repaired, renovated and revived the home, keeping its character but adding thoughtful and transformative modern touches. Now, with an extension that invites the outdoors in with large windows, sliding doors and thriving fernery, the once neglected home is full of life. See more of this home for sale below.",

  "text": "Stepping into this century-old California bungalow is akin to taking a breath of fresh air. With its leafy surrounds and large windows that invite the outdoors in at every opportunity, the cosy family home serves as a cabin-like retreat in the middle of bustling Brunswick West, VIC. But it wasn’t always like this. When the owners of 7 Wales Street first took it on, it was in desperate need of some love. The family engaged Architektura to repair and renovate the old home, maintaining its character but adding modern flourishes. ‘It started as a home in need of some love, and the result is a home that is warm, settled and functional,’ says the owner. From the street the home presents as a renovated period dwelling, however it quickly transitions into a modern and spacious extension that steps down from the original part of the house, elevating the ceilings and immersing itself in nature. ‘The fernery and integrated planter, which has grown to quite incredible proportions, feels like being outdoors,’ explains the owner. ‘You’re always looking at the greenery through the windows too.’ A row of established pines along the fence adds to the cocooning effect, with the family installing integrated seating, firewood storage and a firepit alongside a new timber deck that connects to the sunken lounge inside through large sliding windows. It’s a home that connects to the outside at every opportunity — something, no doubt, its future owners will enjoy as much as its current owners do. 7 Wales Street, Brunswick West is listed for sale with James Labiris and Liz Walker from Nelson Alexander and will go to auction 10am on Saturday March 29.",
