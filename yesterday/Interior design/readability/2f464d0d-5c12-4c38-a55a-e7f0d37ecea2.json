  "text": "China is getting a new museum called the Hainan Science Museum. It was designed by the renowned architectural firm MAD and will be completed in 2025. The museum looks more like a large cloud than a simple architectural structure. It resembles an updraft of warm air rising from the Earth’s surface to form a cloud. The curving exterior is made up of 843 individual pieces of silver-colored fiberglass-reinforced plastic. Designer: MAD The structure is designed to withstand the demanding local tropical climate. The plastic facade sections contain open seams and water-guiding grooves for damage. They are supported by a steel framework and concrete, which provides efficiency and reduces waste. “The shapes and structure of the Hainan Science Museum have been carefully designed to avoid unnecessary space and materials,” says MAD. “The core, floor plates, and main structure are directly connected with the curved facade, ensuring efficient use of resources. The design optimizes everything to reduce waste including integrating circulation and function layout with the building structure.” As you enter the museum, you are welcomed by an intriguing interior. The interior looks like a DNA Helix, according to MAD. It occupies around 500,000 sq ft, spans over five floors, and has a basement level. It is designed like a descending ramp, ranging from top to bottom, creating an alluring vision.  A large skylight is placed at the center, allowing daylight to enter the museum. An elevator takes visitors from the entrance to the top floor, then begins a gentle decline, moving around the winding interior ramp. Visitors have access to views of the lovely landscaped garden on the right and gallery spaces on the left. The science museum’s construction began in 2021 and should be completed by next year. It is part of a large development movement in the popular tourist area of Hainan. This effect also includes another interesting structure by MAD – a spaceship-like library called the Wormhole Library.",
