  "text": "Architecture studios Chetwoods and J\u0026A have transformed a metro station in Shenzhen, China, into a coastal-themed transit hub, drawing on the local landscape and cultural identity. Created as part of Shenzhen's \"Tourism Line\", Dameisha station serves the popular Golden Coast holiday destination. Previously accessible only by car, the station now links  the resort to the city's broader metro network. Chetwoods and J\u0026A have completed Dameisha station in ShenzhenThe station's design was informed by its beachside location and integrates elements of the surrounding topography. \"Rooted in the coastal scenery, the design embodies a sense of freedom, tranquillity, and unhurried comfort, aligning with the overarching tourism theme of Metro Line 8,\" Chetwoods told Dezeen. \"We wanted to create an inviting atmosphere that evokes memories of past beach experiences and the concept of 'dreaming on the beach'.\" The station features motifs that mimic the movement and shapes of wavesThe station's two-level interior features motifs that mimic the shapes of waves and the textures, forms and hues of sand and pebbles. A palette of soft whites contrasts with aquatic blues, evoking the interplay between the shoreline and ocean. \"The architectural language captures the mystery and romance of the sea's infinite movements, reflections, and the dynamic shapes of waves,\" the studio said. The ceiling is crafted from a curved aluminium profileAt the heart of its design is a fluid ceiling pattern that extends to the walls, creating the illusion of underwater movement. The ceiling was crafted from a curved aluminium profile that serves as a canvas for visual details, including perforations and graphic layering. \"Employing a single profile of single-curved aluminium throughout the main arrival hall allowed us to maintain visual fluidity while adhering to budgetary and construction requirements,\" the studio explained. \"By avoiding double-curved or twisted surfaces, we streamlined both the fabrication and assembly processes.\" Conical openings and oval skylights allow natural light inConical openings and oval skylights filter natural light into the underground station, simulating sunlight piercing the surface of the sea. Artificial lighting features, such as pebble-shaped chandeliers suspended in blue-painted voids, complement the natural elements, while ellipse-shaped LED lighting around central columns reference bubbles and ripples in seawater. Interactive marine-inspired details enhance the station's immersive experience. Graphics of swimming fish, turtles and other sea life were embedded within the reflective granite floor tiles while whale-shaped benches serve as playful yet functional design elements. Whale-shaped benches were placed on platforms\"The station was designed to provoke positive emotions, sensory experiences and memories through its exploration and interpretation of the geography and culture of its location, in its forms, colours, textures and materials,\" the studio said. \"Our research into human emotional responses to the built environment plays a pivotal role in our design process, and this project demonstrates the tangible outcomes of that approach.\" Founded in 1988 by Laurie Chetwood, Chetwoods Architects has worked on a number of international projects ranging from large industrial sheds to entries for the Chelsea Flower Show. Recent metro stations spotlighted on Dezeen include Zaha Hadid Architects station in Riyadh's financial district and a Parisian station wrapped in vertical wooden louvres.
