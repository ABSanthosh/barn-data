Mercedes-Benz has expanded its design language into a fresh segment with the Vision V concept, an electric lounge on wheels that straddles the line between limousine and multipurpose vehicle, while steering clear of every cliché. The study rides on the upcoming Van Electric Architecture, but it is the sculpted bodywork, kinetic lighting, and lavish cabin that steal first impressions. Inside, a retractable cinema screen and forty‑two speaker Dolby Atmos array hint at evenings parked beside the Huangpu River with movies filling the glass. Vision V courts families, executives, and weekend gamers in equal measure, proving size can serve serenity when the layout feels art‑directed rather than arranged. Designer: Karsten Riis Jensen Design boss Karsten Riis Jensen describes the show car as a “space of clarity.” His phrase tracks. From the polished aluminum seat bases to the burr‑wood display cabinets, every surface reads like a chapter in a well‑edited magazine. There is no disconnect between the cockpit and the rear lounge; instead, a deliberate gradient exists from driver focus to passenger indulgence. The result looks nothing like the heritage G‑Class, yet the three‑pointed star still guides attention in the dark. Sculptural exterior Mercedes-Benz Vision V Vision V stands noticeably lower than most vans, and that hunkered stance begins with the short front overhang where twin power domes reference past Mercedes sports cars while directing airflow over the windshield. A narrow waist runs the length of the body before tapering into a rounded tail, creating one gentle S‑curve that feels more yacht than shuttle. The sides remain mostly unbroken, so reflections of city lights track along the paint without visual noise. Mercedes-Benz Vision V Chrome window surrounds and polished B-pillar edges add a touch of elegance without slipping into ostentation. Hidden door handles keep the sheet metal uninterrupted, and a single “portal” door on the passenger side slides wide with a powered running board that illuminates the ground for a graceful entry. Mercedes-Benz Vision V Mercedes-Benz Vision V Up front, three horizontal glass louvres glow inside a chrome grille surround. Nearly 200 additional LED-filled louvres frame the opening. When the keyholder approaches, those louvres ripple outward in a choreographed light show before the bonnet star bursts to full brightness. Function follows the theater because each lower strip doubles as an animated indicator during cornering. Mercedes-Benz Vision V Twenty‑four‑inch wheels continue the motif. Each rim features translucent inserts that pulse in sync with the grille sequence and then settle into a steady pattern once underway. Cooling slots are machined behind the inserts, so airflow still feeds the brakes even while the spokes appear sealed. Mercedes-Benz Vision V Mercedes paints the concept in Anthracite Alubeam, a liquid‑metal hue that skews deep graphite when parked inside yet throws silver flake outside at noon. This finish allows the ring of LED louvres surrounding the rear glass—four hundred fifty in total—to glow like a continuous horizon line after sunset. Those louvres act as tail and brake lamps, making conventional housings unnecessary and leaving the back window completely clean except for the central star. Mercedes-Benz Vision V The roof hides photovoltaic panels beneath tinted glass. Designers declined to quote power figures, hinting only that the cells top up auxiliary batteries when the cinema screen and projectors run with the van parked. Aerodynamics sit high on the brief because the upcoming VAN.EA platform targets long-range. Underbody trays, flush glazing, and that tapering roofline combine for an impressive drag figure, although exact numbers remain confidential. What matters is that the silhouette presents calm confidence rather than slippery compromise. Mercedes-Benz Vision V Private lounge interior Mercedes-Benz Vision V Cross the running board, and the floor feels almost residential—wide planks split by narrow glass fins that turn opaque or transparent on demand. Through those fins, a 65-inch 4K cinema display rises once the doors are sealed. Two passengers now face a screen large enough to block their view of the cockpit, an intentional partition that sets the tone for what Mercedes calls the Private Lounge. Mercedes-Benz Vision V Seating resembles mid-century daybeds updated for the modern era. Tubular cushions form each backrest and leg rest, cinched by bright aluminum loops. The modules recline into a flat position, creating an impromptu bed without awkward joints. Massage, heating, and full ergonomic adjustment arrive via capacitive switches tucked into polished armrest inlays. Mercedes-Benz Vision V Materials walk a fine line between craft and technology. Crystal‑white Nappa leather meets shimmering silk within one stitch line. Open‑pore burr wood frames the side walls, interrupted only by glass display cabinets that store handbags or sunglasses and, on one shelf, a racing‑game controller ready for the Gaming mode on the main screen. Mercedes-Benz Vision V Audio designers hid forty-two loudspeakers around the cabin, including exciters beneath the seat leather, so bass tracks ripple across the shoulders. Round glass housings cantilever from the side panels like art pieces, revealing the drivers within. Seven projectors are mounted on the ceiling and floor, turning side windows into digital extensions of the main display for a 360‑degree scene, whether streaming a film or visualizing navigation. Mercedes-Benz Vision V Mercedes-Benz Vision V Mercedes layers seven experiential modes across this hardware. Entertainment handles cinema nights while Relax paints slow landscapes across the glass. Work shifts the screen into a wide desktop with calendars and video calls. Shopping conjures virtual storefronts. Discovery overlays augmented reality onto real surroundings. Gaming taps that controller for racing sessions. And Karaoke turns the lounge into a rolling stage for weekend road trips. Mercedes-Benz Vision V Fragrance also plays its part. A milled aluminum capsule behind the center console releases a cultured scent, timed to coincide with ambient lighting that fades from cool blue to warm amber as the tracks change. The center console itself can glide fore and aft with seat movement. Press once on the leather-wrapped touchpad, and the top flips open to reveal a real chessboard in dark walnut inlay —a nod to slow travel, even in a high-tech environment. Digital cockpit and VAN.EA tech Those riding up front face the Superscreen, a trio of displays joined behind a single pane of glass that stretches pillar to pillar. Real-time graphics match navigation data with driver-assist sensors, so the map shows actual traffic swirling around the van instead of abstract icons. The steering wheel rim skips flat tops and bottoms for a perfectly circular shape trimmed in white leather, proving that touch controls and tradition can share one surface. Mercedes-Benz Vision V Under the skin sits VAN.EA. The scalable electric platform is expected to arrive in production form by 2026 and promises multiple body styles. However, the Vision V previews the top tier, where battery packaging stretches the wheelbase length to maximize cabin space, before assessing cargo capacity. Modular packs will allow buyers to choose range targets, and the architecture is engineered for high‑speed charging, compatible with. Closing thoughts Vision V surfaces at a moment when electric luxury often leans toward SUV machismo. Mercedes‑Benz instead revisits the idea of a social foyer on wheels, wrapping it in quiet aerodynamics and saturating it with digital possibility. If the production model retains half the lighting drama and all of the seating innovation, long‑distance travel could soon feel closer to a boutique hotel suite than a shuttle. Mercedes-Benz Vision V Families might use the 65‑inch screen for animated movies, executives might parse spreadsheets in Work mode, and teenagers will undoubtedly call dibs on Karaoke during late‑night drives. Regardless of the scenario, the concept suggests that the future Mercedes van will view time on the road as time reclaimed rather than lost. Mercedes-Benz Vision V",
