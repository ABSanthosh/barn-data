  "description": "A Sydney couple recently purchased this Southern Highlands country-style house, built in the early 2000s. Keen to avoid a cliched ‘moving to the country typical look’ they engaged Arent\u0026Pyke to redesign the interior in their signature colourful and glamorous, yet classic and comfortable, style. Within five months of the initial concept meeting, the interior was transformed. It’s now a sophisticated and stylish home suitable for relaxed entertaining, elevated by Italian designer furniture and interesting fabric selections.",

  "text": "There were no structural issues with this Southern Highlands, NSW home (an archetypal country-style residence built in the early 2000s) but until recently, the interiors were cluttered and lacked any sort of interesting detailing. ‘A lot of wall joinery cluttered the main living space and walls were painted with tones that enhanced its twee cottage-like sentiment,’ says Juliette Arent, creative director and co-founder of Arent\u0026Pyke. ‘It needed to feel like a sanctuary, balancing cosmopolitan sophistication in the form of expressive stone selections and exquisite fabrics, with all the comforts of a rural escape.’ The owners called on Arent\u0026Pyke to imbue the space with a sense of luxury and sophistication for an overall relaxing atmosphere. Juliette explains, ‘Above all, the home needed to feel like the sort of place you could kick your feet up on the sofa.’ Paramount to the brief was a tight deadline. Juliette says, ‘The couple’s key request was that everything selected had to be in stock and ready to ship (also factoring in international freight transit), resulting in a speedy five-month turnaround from our initial concept meeting to completion.’ With this deadline in mind, Arent\u0026Pyke integrated furniture selections into their very first concept presentation, which in turn drove the wider look of the project. The first space to be updated was the kitchen, which was completely gutted to favour usable bench space over bulky joinery. Arent\u0026Pyke were able to integrate three separate dining areas (casual seating at small island bench, banquette dining nook, and large dining table) across the kitchen and adjoining living area to suit hosting small to large parties at the home. ‘Within the open living space, we coated walls and the ceiling in a wheat shade that cocoons you in a gentle warmth, especially in the cooler months,’ says Juliette. ‘We also juxtaposed slick primary shades with soothing tones in this area to define zones.’ The abundant garden and landscape outside also provided inspiration, introducing rich autumnal shades such as glossy red on the tomato red Bramante lacquered sideboard by Cassina. The low profile of the B\u0026B Italia Camaleonda sofa enhances the room’s impressive dimensions, while its gentle sage tone mirrors the greenery outside and draws the user in. ‘The shimmering bronze elements of an oversized CC-Tapis rug grounding the sofa adds another autumnal reference,’ says Juliette. ‘The vast room feels intimate and cosy through this colour drenching technique.’ In the main bedroom, Arent\u0026Pyke stripped the existing wardrobe joinery, replacing it with furniture to lounge on and daydream through the window. The guest bedroom and bathroom are a ‘symphony’ of deep blue with a soft greenish undertone. ‘Their saturated wall tones gently whisper serenity for visiting city friends in need of deep slumber,’ says Juliette. The interior is elevated throughout by dramatic focal points, including the golden velvet drapes over arched doorways, and patterned fabrics on custom upholstery intended to animate areas and igniting the imagination. These details paired with the furniture selection conveys the personality of the owners, without sacrificing their comfort. ‘Rather than clutter this home with myriad pieces, we selected furnishings that added impact via their sheer scale and tone,’ says Juliette. ‘You could say our motto was “less is more” and equally, “choose well; make it last”…. Every inclusion is intentional. It’s needed and used.’",
