  "text": "NeoGrace—a project by Anastasiia Novikova—is a home that redefines the boundaries of tradition and innovation. The intricate wall moldings show the best of classical artistry. Simultaneously, the bold, contemporary furnishings demand their fair share of attention. This home blends two eras to create a living experience that feels effortlessly luxurious, yet refreshingly current. The foyer in NeoGrace is open and welcoming. We see white dominating the space, setting a modern base. This is complemented with a French-style door, which adds a classical touch. A dark wooden console table—quite traditional in itself—is paired with contemporary round metallic legs. In the living area, a curved, asymmetrical sofa creates visual intrigue. This is paired with a black coffee table factoring in luxury and an arched floor lamp illuminating the space. The artwork in the space also uses a contrast of white and black. The classic element in the living room is the vintage-style fireplace. This is flanked with asymmetrical decor: a statement chair on one end and a sculpture atop a marble block on the other. Dark herringbone flooring ties the space together, and can be seen continuing into the kitchen. This space incorporates a luxurious marble backsplash as well as island. The matte black cabinetry is opulent in itself, while the lack of hardware keeps it modern. Finally, the dining table features a chunky base but is paired with minimalist chairs. The dark wooden cabinetry in this space provides storage, but instantly doubles as decor, too. A patterned chair gives you a quick spot to sit. The floor lamp will illuminate your book as you flip its pages, and the interesting sculptural side table gives a resting spot for your coffee. It’s actually a cozy nook, but incredibly sophisticated in design. The home office in NeoGrace sticks to a minimalist table, comfy chair, and table lamp. The glass-front cabinet showcases wooden drawers. These bring in a traditional touch. There’s also room for guests (the stylish way). A chunky sofa is paired with a wooden block doubling as a console table, while a textured piece of art brings the space to life. This bedroom is modern when it comes to the neutral color palette, but the ornate wall moldings bring in the traditional style, as do the two wooden nightstands. (The sense of symmetry these create also contribute to a traditional vibe!). Circular pendant lights hang freely in the air, while an accent chair adds a punch of color. The orange artwork is bold enough to form the focal point. The bathroom in NeoGrace is no less than a spa. A white and black color palette, freestanding bathtub, and large potted plant set the ambiance. This is further enhanced with the neatly folded towels doubling as decor. The double vanity makes sure you can segregate your spaces while getting ready!",
