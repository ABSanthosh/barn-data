All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Many people are well-acquainted with the golden rule of lighting, at least according to social media: Never, ever flip on the big light, right? All kidding aside, you probably do rely on a variety of directional lighting options, like table and desk lamps, as your go-to methods for illuminating a space. But did you know there’s actually a formula for making the most out of your lamplight? It all starts with the right shade. Yes, selecting the right lampshade isn’t just for aesthetics. Lampshades play an important role in creating the right diffusion of light, which can enhance the overall functionality and vibe of a room.But don’t just take my word for it. I went straight to the (light) source for this intel and spoke to Jason Fredrick, the product operations manager at Shades of Light, a lighting retailer that also designs and manufactures many of its own exclusive products. “Everyone’s design style is unique to them, but following a few basic tenants helps you get started on the path towards finding a shade that is proportionate to the base,” Fredrick says. A proportioned lampshade should feel visually balanced with its base — not overwhelming it or making it feel too small. Balance here is important for the quality of light in a room as well. A shade that’s too little might not cover the bulb correctly, resulting in harsher light. Something that’s too large runs the risk of creating dark spots in a room.Credit: Design: Apartment TherapySo what does balance look like in practice? According to Fredrick, the ideal shade width (often listed as diameter) should be approximately equal to the height of the base, and the height of the shade should be about two-thirds the height of the base (and closer to one-fourth the height for floor lamps). Additionally, a shade should always be wider than the lamp’s largest point. Another element to consider when selecting a shade? “Ensure the harp — the hardware that holds the shade — is the correct size, and that the shade covers the socket and balances properly with the base,” he says. These are things you can see visually, so just do a quick check when you are installing your new lampshade.So the next time you’re looking to outfit your space with a new lamp, be sure to use these tips to find your perfect match size-wise. This will guarantee your new lamp casts the right glow and brings both style and function to wherever you put it.",
