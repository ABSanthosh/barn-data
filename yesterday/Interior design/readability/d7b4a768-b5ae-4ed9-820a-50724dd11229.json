Inspired by this regal creature, the Leo Safari Cabin stands proudly atop rugged rocks, offering an unforgettable luxury retreat for wildlife enthusiasts. Designer: Thilina Liyanage This stunning one-bedroom villa harmoniously blends into its surroundings, crafted from locally sourced bamboo and wood. The architectural design pays homage to the strength and grandeur of the lion, making it a statement piece amidst the untamed wilderness. Upon arrival, guests ascend a flight of stairs leading to the villa’s entrance, where a warm, wooden aesthetic greets them. Recessed floor uplights illuminate the path, enhancing the forest ambiance and guiding visitors into an inviting open lobby on the ground floor. The lounge space offers cozy, thoughtfully arranged furniture, creating the perfect setting to unwind after an adventurous day in the wild. At the heart of the villa is the bedroom on the first floor, a masterpiece of design featuring a double-height ceiling that exudes the same grandeur as the lion itself. This expansive space opens up to two balconies; one at the front and another at the back. The front balcony is built within the beautifully sculpted bamboo lion’s face, casting intricate shadows that dance across the room as the sunlight filters through. It’s a mesmerizing sight to wake up to, enhancing the overall jungle experience. On the opposite end, the bedroom seamlessly connects to a bathroom that extends onto the rear balcony. Guests can bask in the tranquil views of the surrounding forest, immersing themselves in the serene beauty of nature, all while enjoying the warm-lit ambiance that extends throughout the villa even after sunset. For those seeking an even more elevated experience, the villa offers a rooftop deck, an intimate space perfect for a candlelit dinner or a relaxing summer brunch. Designed with just enough room for a table for four, this deck provides an uninterrupted panoramic view of the wilderness, making it an ideal setting to soak in the magic of the safari in utmost comfort.",
