A cluttered garage not only makes it hard to find what you need at a given moment, but it also limits how you can use the space in general. If your garage is overflowing with tools, boxes, and forgotten items, don’t worry. A few smart storage solutions can transform it into a space that works for you. Here’s how to make it happen. Start with a Full Cleanout Before adding any storage solutions, clear everything out of your garage. Sorting through everything at once helps you see what you actually need to keep and what’s just taking up space. Separate items into three categories: keep, donate, or throw away. Be honest about what you use. If something has been untouched for years, it’s probably not worth keeping. Once the space is completely empty, it’s easier to plan a more efficient setup and make room for better storage solutions.

Adjustable metal or wooden shelving units allow you to customize the height to fit different items. Store bulky or seasonal items, like camping gear or holiday decorations, on higher shelves. Keep everyday essentials like car cleaning supplies or toolboxes at an easy-to-reach level. By stacking upwards, you use more vertical space and thus leave your floors much more open. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / Pressmaster Use Clear Storage Bins or Labels Plastic storage bins keep smaller items contained and protected from dust, but not all bins are created equal. Clear bins allow you to see what’s inside without opening them, which is helpful on its own, and adding labels to those bins makes organization even easier. Labels on opaque bins work just as well too, especially if they’re large and easy to read at a distance. Group similar items together like gardening tools, extension cords, holiday decorations, and sports equipment. Once you start to memorize the system you’ve built, you’ll be able to find anything in a flash.

Instead of digging through drawers or toolboxes, you can see everything right away all at once. Use metal hooks and holders to arrange tools in a way that makes sense for how you use them. Outline each tool’s spot with a marker so everything gets put back in the right place. A pegboard keeps tools off surfaces and helps prevent them from getting lost.

Instead of running back and forth to grab tools, you can keep everything in one portable station that adjusts with your workflow. Choose a cart with multiple drawers to store wrenches, screwdrivers, and power tools. When you’re done, roll the cart into a designated corner to keep the space tidy. A mobile storage solution allows for flexibility, whether you’re fixing a car or working on a DIY project. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / Mint_Images Keep Everyday Items Accessible Not everything in your garage should be tucked away. Items like shoes, reusable shopping bags, or frequently used tools should be within easy reach. A small shelving unit or storage bench near the entrance can keep your more commonly used items always at your fingertips. Install a key hook or wall-mounted organizer to hold car keys, flashlights, dog leashes, and the like. Keeping everyday essentials in one place prevents them from getting lost in the otherwise chaotic clutter of a garage. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / Nestea06 When it comes to creating a functional garage, the key is to store things in a way that makes sense for how you use them. This could mean keeping some things near the door, creating an organized shelving system, or giving everything a nice big label telling you exactly what it is. Once everything has a designated spot, it’s much easier to keep your garage clean and efficient in the long run.

A small shelving unit or storage bench near the entrance can keep your more commonly used items always at your fingertips. Install a key hook or wall-mounted organizer to hold car keys, flashlights, dog leashes, and the like. Keeping everyday essentials in one place prevents them from getting lost in the otherwise chaotic clutter of a garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_266900\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-266900\"\u003e            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/car-repair-tools-at-service-station-2025-02-12-06-30-56-utc-68890-scaled.jpg?width=480\" media=\"(max-width: 481px)\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\"/\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/car-repair-tools-at-service-station-2025-02-12-06-30-56-utc-68890-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Car repair tools at service station.\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/car-repair-tools-at-service-station-2025-02-12-06-30-56-utc-68890-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/car-repair-tools-at-service-station-2025-02-12-06-30-56-utc-68890-270x180.jpg 270w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/car-repair-tools-at-service-station-2025-02-12-06-30-56-utc-68890-923x615.jpg 923w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/car-repair-tools-at-service-station-2025-02-12-06-30-56-utc-68890-768x513.jpg 768w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/car-repair-tools-at-service-station-2025-02-12-06-30-56-utc-68890-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/car-repair-tools-at-service-station-2025-02-12-06-30-56-utc-68890-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/car-repair-tools-at-service-station-2025-02-12-06-30-56-utc-68890-385x257.jpg 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"/\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\n                \n                \n            \u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-266900\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://elements.envato.com/car-repair-tools-at-service-station-HZLXAAY\"\u003ePhoto Credit: Envato Elements / Nestea06\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp data-start=\"4538\" data-end=\"4929\" data-is-last-node=\"\"\u003eWhen it comes to creating a functional garage, the key is to store things in a way that makes sense for how you use them. This could mean keeping some things near the door, creating an organized shelving system, or giving everything a nice big label telling you exactly what it is.
