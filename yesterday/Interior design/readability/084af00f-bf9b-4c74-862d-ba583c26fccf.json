Goodbye October, Hello November. Did you remember to turn your clocks back last night? Many people don’t like that the early evening hours will be darker now. I am not one of them as I love the cozy homey feel the time change provides for the dinner hour. I will put my kitchen counter lamp on (open in same tab) and play some relaxing tunes while I prepare dinner and I am in a happy place. In about two weeks I will start listening to my favorite Christmas music when it gets dark which will make the dinner hour feel even more magical. How about you? Do you like when it gets dark earlier now that the clocks went back an hour? Posts You May Have Missed This Week: What’s up with my House \u0026 Life updates.
