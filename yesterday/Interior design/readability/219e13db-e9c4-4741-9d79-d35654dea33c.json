  "text": "French designer Philippe Starck has used Brazilian materials for the interiors of the penthouse at the Rosewood São Paulo, inside a tower by architect Jean Nouvel. The multi-level suite occupies the top floors of Nouvel's Mata Atlantica \"vertical garden tower\" and is one of several serviced Rosewood Residences within the building. The penthouse has a huge double-height living area with floor-to-ceiling glazingMeasuring 12,000 square feet and comfortably sleeping eight, the penthouse sits at one of the highest points in São Paulo and is afforded uninterrupted, panoramic views across the city. Starck's team was responsible for the interiors and terraces throughout the Rosewood São Paulo hotel and residences, and took the same approach to using local materials throughout the project. Materials like warm-toned ipe wood create a modern take on Brazilian modernismInside the penthouse, marbles sourced from Paraná and warm-toned ipe wood create a dramatic and contemporary take on Brazilian modernism. \"While the layout allows for separation from the hustle and bustle below, all design touches still work to make guests feel connected to the spirit of the city,\" said the Rosewood team. The kitchen features sculptural stone islands with curved cornersThe penthouse is filled with furniture and artworks by Brazilian artists and designers, including Tarsila do Amaral, Jean-Baptiste Debret, Jerome Sainte Rose, Julio Bittencourt, Tércio Teixeira, Lúcio Consul, Renato Marcelo Rei and Oscar Niemeyer. \"The artists' works tell different stories of life in Brazil across various mediums including sculpture, paintings, tile work, drawings, textiles, and rugs, providing a visual and meaningful touchpoint back to the destination's rich culture,\" the team said. The swooping staircase with floating marble treads is based on an Oscar Niemeyer designThe huge double-height living area is surrounded by floor-to-ceiling glass, making the most of the skyline vista, while a high-gloss ceiling reflects the windows to allow the space to feel even taller. An ensuite bedroom, a kitchen with sculptural stone islands, a patterned wallpaper-lined powder room and back-of-house quarters are also located on the lower level. The majority of the furniture and artworks in the penthouse are by Brazilian artists and designersAt the end of the living room is a focal staircase with floating marble treads based on a Niemeyer design in Brasilia, which swoops up to a mezzanine walkway. This provides access to a study and TV room, the primary bedroom suite and additional sleeping quarters. Windows look onto the terraces planted with tropical floraThe primary suite encompasses a marble-clad bathroom with a matching freestanding egg-shaped tub, which has a view of the cityscape through a glass panel onto the mezzanine. A long corridor with closet storage on both sides leads through to the bedroom, which can be wrapped in electronically controlled blackout curtains at the push of a button. The penthouse comfortably sleeps eight guestsMost of the windows are surrounded on the exterior by tropical foliage that grows on the tower's expansive terraces, some of which are accessible. \"The lush landscaping is filled with a captivating array of vibrant plants native to the surrounding rainforest, an extension of the awe-inspiring biophilic design of the hotel's entire Mata Atlantica tower,\" said the team. In the primary bathroom, an egg-shaped marble tub is afforded a skyline viewOn the roof, accessed via a black spiral staircase, is a jungle-like garden of tropical plants through which flagstone pathways lead to hidden seating areas and a hot tub. The end of the path emerges at an infinity pool overlooking Avenida Paulista, lined with dramatic blue, green and orange stone and flanked by plants on either side. A pitched weathering-steel frame rises over the water, mimicking the rooflines of the historic buildings that comprise the Cidade Matarazzo – a former hospital turned mixed-use complex – below. The penthouse and the other residences within the tower have access to all of the hotel's restaurants and pool areas, as well as amenities including the spa and fitness centre. As one of the highest points in São Paulo, the roof terrace enjoys panoramic views across the cityPrivately owned, the residences are available for guests to book depending on availability. The Rosewood group is rapidly expanding its global portfolio of permanent residences, with recent announcements including Los Cabos and Beverly Hills. Pathways lead through the jungle-like foliage to seating areas and the swimming pool\"People are no longer just looking for a home, but a fully serviced lifestyle,\" Brad Berry, Rosewood's vice president of global residential development, told Dezeen. \"Owners gain access to a carefully curated lifestyle where every detail has been designed to meet the highest standard of comfort and sophistication.\" Covered by a weathering-steel frame, the infinity pool overlooks Avenida Paulista and the city beyondStarck is one of the world's best-known contemporary designers and is behind many iconic hospitality projects. His other recent work in South America includes a skyscraper in Ecuador that was unveiled last year. The photography is courtesy of Rosewood.
