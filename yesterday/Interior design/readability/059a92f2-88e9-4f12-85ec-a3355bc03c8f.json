  "text": "The Serene Stone Bedroom—designed by Pasha Prannychuk—is a masterclass in refined tranquility. Soft golden light filters through the floor-to-ceiling windows, highlighting the textured stone wall. This whispers stories of nature’s timeless beauty. Every detail—from the plush bed to the stone tub—is carefully curated to create an effortlessly sophisticated atmosphere. This isn’t just an apartment. It’s a retreat; a harmonious blend of organic textures and warm neutrals. From the grounding presence of natural materials to the subtle architectural details, the Serene Stone Bedroom is designed to evoke calm and quiet luxury. The natural stone feature wall is the focal point of the bedroom. It adds depth and character to the space. Soft, indirect lighting highlights the rugged beauty of the stone, which creates a warm ambiance. The double pendant lights with stone lampshades hang only on one side of the bed, adding a sense of asymmetry while highlighting the decor on the nightstand. The bedroom is an affair of beige, taupe, and soft ivory, which creates a restful atmosphere. The low-slung upholstered bed frame uses soft fabric. Towards the foot of the bed is a plush bench, providing extra seating space in the room. The bedding is sleek and minimalist, with an added throw for some coziness. The flooring—as seen in the bedroom as well as the hallway leading to the space—uses hardwood. Textured wall art also creates a statement. The bathroom in the Serene Stone Bedroom is segregated with a glass partition. It is open and airy, and features a natural stone tub. We especially love the multifunctionality it offers. On one end, the bathtub gives residents the opportunity for a calming soak.  On the other end is cabinetry using wooden panels and a modern design. In the center, we see a wall-mounted desk paired with an ottoman. This can make for a quiet study or a workstation. The recessed wall feature—seen on either wall of the bathroom—is illuminated with LED lighting and provides room to place some decor. The large, floor-to-ceiling window allows soft and diffused natural light to illuminate the space.",
