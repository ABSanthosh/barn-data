  "text": "UNDER $300 If you’re looking to splurge, Sydney brand Saint Valentine Jewellery has you covered with the beautiful Mum Bracelet. The wavy pattern subtly spells out ‘mum’, making it an extra sentimental way to mark this Mother’s Day. For those more practical mums, we suggest treating them to fresh pair of sneakers like the Axel II by FRANKIE4. The shoes are designed by podiatrists, so you can trust they are equal parts cute and ultra-comfortable. And homewares are always a great gift. Treat her to a luxurious night’s sleep on one of Sheridan’s Lanham Silk Pillowcases, made from incredibly soft mulberry silk! We also love the bold colours of the cosy Ranch Throw by Fenton \u0026 Fenton — it’s a perfect companion for curling up on the couch this winter.
