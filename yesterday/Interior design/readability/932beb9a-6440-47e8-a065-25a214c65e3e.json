And with the new store opening just a stone's throw from Ideal Home headquarters, we can’t wait to check it out.Opening its doors on 1 May 2025, this is everything you can expect from the brand-new Oxford Street store.(Image credit: IKEA)The IKEA Oxford Street store will offer the traditional IKEA experience that we all know and love. Set over three floors and 5,800 square metres, it has the famed IKEA showrooms as well as a diner serving the signature meatballs.However, upon entering the ground level of the store, the room has been designed into a London-inspired space, which was co-created with Londoners to reflect the city, as well as IKEA’s own character.‘Whether a local Londoner or a tourist passing through, IKEA Oxford Street aims to inspire home dreams for everyone – offering beautifully designed, functional furnishings at prices affordable for as many people as possible, ensuring visitors leave with ideas and solutions that make everyday life at home a little better,’ says Peter Jelkeby, CEO and Chief Sustainability Officer at IKEA UK.(Image credit: IKEA)Despite its signature London design, you can still shop for IKEA pieces that will never go out of style as well as the best budget IKEA buys.
