All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Chinasa CooperIf your decor style leans towards minimalism and that aesthetic is feeling a little, well, lifeless, you’re not alone. Minimalism’s clean lines and neutral palette can give a space a classy, polished feel — however, its focus on those very qualities can also make things feel a little dull. Luckily I just rediscovered a trend on social media — specifically, on TikTok — that mixes the best of minimalism with plenty of earthy rawness to create a warm and homey space. Some content creators and design enthusiasts call it Organic Modern, and Apartment Therapy even has a whole collection of House Tours that feature Organic Modern elements.Organic Modern’s renewed popularity has led to its appearance in more homes, with some variations (some of which skew almost Scandinavian in look). At its best, Organic Modern style can keep a minimalist space from being boring by adding texture and layering — all without packing a space with excess stuff. I spoke to three interior pros to find out more about this look and how to channel it in your home.What Is Organic Modern?“It’s about contrasting organic elements with modern design and finding a balance of the two to create a peaceful, calm aesthetic that feels good,” says Jeanne Chung, founder and lead designer of Cozy Stylish Chic. “Contrast is key to this look, specifically the contrast between raw and refined,” adds Angie Guzman, founder and designer at Angie Guzman Design.Organic Modern interiors blur the lines between the outside and inside by drawing lots of inspiration from the raw imperfection of nature — whether that’s shapes, materials, or earthy tones. As nature is at the heart of Organic Modern, Temi Johnson, founder and principal at Temi Johnson Design, advises using it as the foundation of your design to effortlessly achieve this look.Aesthetically, this California home fits the Organic Modern style perfectly: Nature is a huge feature, with the outside and inside seamlessly becoming one space. Natural organic elements are dotted throughout the space, including an actual tree planted inside the home.How to Get the Organic Modern LookIf all this sounds like something you want to try in your home, here are some designer-approved tips to keep in mind. I live in a small Victorian flat in London, and it's typical to have gorgeous fireplaces with alcove space on either side. When I bought the flat, I wanted to make the alcove spaces more useful, so I dove into the world of DIY, bought a jigsaw, and installed these made-to-measure cabinets by myself.Bring in the PlantsWith nature at the center of Organic Modern design, it’s no surprise that plants are a key feature of this aesthetic. Sprinkle plants throughout your home (like the owner of this U.K. apartment did), but don’t stop there. According to Guzman, you could also try “placing large, round plants in straight-edged planters, or trailing some ivy over windows to contrast the straight lines of window frames.”Play with ShapesWhile modern interiors favor sleek lines, Organic Modern is all about mixing different shapes, as seen in this Massachusetts apartment. “[This could mean] placing a curved sofa next to a crisp square coffee table, or laying a hand-knotted rug under a sharp-lined dining table. One’s all plush, one’s all sharp — perfect contrast!” says Guzman.Use Contrasting Materials Johnson suggests using contrasting materials like warm wood with cool concrete to create a marriage between the indoors and outdoors, like the residents of this Peru house did. You could also try “placing handwoven baskets on polished stone surfaces, or nubby wool throws tossed over smooth leather chairs,” as Guzman prefers. It’s that raw-meets-refined look that adds warmth and visual interest to a space.Bring the Outdoors InDon’t focus purely on your indoor space — instead, embrace indoor-outdoor living in any way you can, advises Chung. Glass doors and picture windows are the obvious ways to blur boundaries, as seen in this Weston, Colorado house. But when that’s not possible, Guzman recommends decorating with things like earthy ceramics, live-edge tables, and natural wood accents (think: driftwood pieces or wood panelling) to bring an outdoorsy vibe to the inside.Maximise Natural LightOrganic Modern spaces are light and bright, and allow as much natural light to flood the space as possible. No matter how big or small your windows are, getting rid of heavy window treatments and replacing them with woven wood shades will allow more natural light into the home, according to Chung. If privacy isn’t an issue, consider going a step further and leaving windows bare or with the sheerest of coverings using natural linen or cotton voiles like this organic modern Chicago home.",
