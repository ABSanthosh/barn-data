  "text": "Long before modern convenience dulled our instincts, blades were the difference between survival and disaster. Bushcraft knives, in particular, carry that primal DNA. They aren’t flashy, they aren’t delicate, and they sure as hell aren’t meant to be babied. These are knives that thrive in the dirt, the rain, and the raw brutality of the outdoors. A good one will baton wood, carve traps, skin game, and still be sharp enough to shave the hair off your arm. The best ones, though? They don’t just work—they feel like an extension of you. That’s the magic of a truly well-designed blade. We’ve covered Buhov’s work before—his previous bushcraft knife was a brutal yet refined masterpiece, built for both survivalists and collectors. Now, he’s back with a new design, one that pushes even further into rugged territory. This new fixed blade strips away the unnecessary, leaving behind a weaponized workhorse of steel and G-10. Aggressive yet utilitarian, it carries the DNA of bushcraft tradition while embracing modern tactical elements. A knife built to get dirty, take abuse, and come back for more. Designer: Nikolai Buhov The blade commands attention with its savage, hammered texture along the spine, almost reminiscent of chipped flint or the teeth of a serrated predator. The full-tang construction speaks of durability, while the sweeping curve of the blade suggests versatility—perfect for carving, slicing, or handling heavy-duty survival tasks. This isn’t a knife that’s made to be caged indoors and relegated to merely opening Amazon boxes. It’s designed to be used, abused, and trusted when things get tough. Ergonomically shaped and textured for a secure grip, the green G-10 scales offer both comfort and control. The sculpted surface almost mimics reptilian armor, adding a layer of visual intrigue that pairs seamlessly with the blade’s raw, weathered finish. It feels like something forged for the elements, a knife that thrives in the untamed wild. Whether you’re setting up camp, processing game, or tackling a worst-case scenario, this handle won’t let you down when grip strength matters most. Paired with a custom-molded Kydex sheath, the knife is as practical in carry as it is in use. A Ulticlip attachment ensures secure retention, whether you’re clipping it to a belt, pack, or pocket. The minimalist sheath design keeps things streamlined, allowing for quick deployment without unnecessary bulk. This is exactly the kind of carry system that tactical enthusiasts and survivalists dream about—simple, effective, and built for real-world application. All of Buhov’s knives are designed from scratch and made by hand. The knives you see are limited to one-off units that Buhov sells to patrons looking to commission a blade. You can contact him on Facebook for more information.",
