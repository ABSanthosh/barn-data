But there are also some things that are timeless and have stood the test of time. One of those is the Scaleo Folding Ladder, created by Italian industrial designers Roberto Lucci and Paolo Orlandini in 1974. This remarkable piece proves that exceptional design transcends decades, remaining as relevant today as it was nearly fifty years ago. The Scaleo’s genius lies in its elegant simplicity. Manufactured by Velca in Milan, the ladder is constructed from ABS polymer and aluminum, measuring 52 x 8 x 3 1/4 inches when closed. This compact profile transforms what was traditionally a bulky household necessity into a sleek, space-saving solution that would feel perfectly at home in today’s urban apartments and minimalist interiors. It proves that truly great design is timeless, continuing to inspire and serve us decades after its creation. Designers: Roberto Lucci and Paolo Orlandini What makes the Scaleo particularly fascinating is how it anticipated many of the design principles we value today. In 1974, when most household items were purely utilitarian, Lucci and Orlandini created something that was both beautiful and functional. The ladder’s clean lines and thoughtful proportions demonstrate the Italian design philosophy of “bella figura,” the idea that everyday objects should be as aesthetically pleasing as they are practical. The choice of materials was revolutionary for its time. ABS polymer, a relatively new material in the 1970s, offered durability and lightweight properties that traditional wood or metal ladders couldn’t match. This forward-thinking approach to material selection mirrors today’s emphasis on innovative, sustainable materials in product design. The aluminum components provide structural integrity while maintaining the ladder’s portability, a feature that resonates strongly with our contemporary mobile lifestyle. Perhaps most remarkably, the Scaleo’s folding mechanism addresses one of the most persistent challenges in modern living: storage. As urban spaces become increasingly compact, the ability to transform a functional tool into a virtually invisible storage solution has never been more valuable. The ladder’s ingenious folding system allows it to disappear into narrow spaces, making it ideal for small apartments, studios, and modern homes where every square inch matters. The Museum of Modern Art’s decision to include the Scaleo in its permanent collection speaks to its enduring significance in design history. Being housed alongside other iconic pieces validates what design enthusiasts have long recognized: the Scaleo represents a perfect marriage of form and function that continues to influence contemporary product design. Today’s designers still reference the Scaleo’s principles when creating space-saving solutions. Its influence can be seen in everything from modern furniture that transforms and adapts to small spaces to contemporary storage solutions that prioritize both aesthetics and functionality.",
