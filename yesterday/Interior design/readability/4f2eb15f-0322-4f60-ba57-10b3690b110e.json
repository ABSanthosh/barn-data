  "text": "The legacy of Dongju Yun (1917.12.30 – 1945.02.16), a renowned Korean poet and independence activist, has inspired many across generations. With a life marked by profound introspection and unwavering integrity, his works continue to resonate deeply. In homage to his memory and contributions, the “Poet” smart pen design project was born, a tribute to Yun’s enduring spirit and the value of thoughtful creativity in everyday life. “Poet” is more than just a tool for writing and drawing; it’s a medium to instill meaning into everyday moments. The design team aimed to embody the warmth and respect symbolized by Dongju Yun’s life, encouraging users to pause and appreciate the significance of time and expression. The pen represents a blend of artistry and utility, mirroring the poet’s ability to weave profound reflections into simple, everyday language. Designers: NARA LEE, junsu lee, and Jiung Yun Although Dongju Yun did not actively participate in Korea’s independence movement, he grappled with deep shame and chose to channel his feelings into poignant self-reflection. His consistent use of the Korean language in all his works, from drafts to published poetry collections, highlights his devotion to his cultural identity. This unwavering integrity influenced the “Poet” design. The handle of the pen, a part held closely by the user’s hand, is crafted with a thicker and sturdier CMF (color, material, and finish) than the upper sections. This deliberate contrast emphasizes strength and resilience, aligning with the poet’s enduring legacy. The “Poet” pen draws inspiration from five of Dongju Yun’s most iconic works. Each pen’s name, color, and design motifs are based on symbolic elements from these poems. Visualizations of these motifs are engraved on the charger and pen point, subtly embedding the poet’s essence into every interaction. Through this thoughtful integration of color and imagery, “Poet” becomes a tribute to Yun’s artistry. The design of “Poet” embodies the softness and simplicity characteristic of Dongju Yun’s poetic style. Gentle curves dominate the pen’s form, mirroring his use of everyday language to create profound expressions. A nod to the classic ink bottle, the pen’s refill mechanism is designed to resemble smooth, natural curves, further enhancing the tactile and visual experience. One of the standout features of “Poet” is its innovative charger design. The charger’s base includes a slanted cut that allows the pen cap to magnetically attach during charging, addressing a common issue of misplaced caps. This thoughtful addition integrates practicality with aesthetics, enhancing the overall user experience. By reinterpreting traditional forms and embedding symbolic details, the “Poet” smart pen becomes more than just a writing instrument. It’s a celebration of Dongju Yun’s life, a reflection of his poetic elegance, and a tool that inspires users to find meaning in every moment. Whether in the act of writing, sketching, or simply holding the pen, “Poet” invites us to pause and connect with the timeless values of integrity, creativity, and cultural pride.",
