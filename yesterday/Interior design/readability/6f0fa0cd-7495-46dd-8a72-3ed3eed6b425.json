  "text": "This Post May Contain Affiliate Links. Please Read Our Disclosure Policy here Click here for above sources Have you furnished a home lately? So many options your head starts to spin. I think this is partially why I prefer to use what I have. Less thinking involved :). I do love finding secondhand furniture but am more picky about upholstered pieces so I’m probably ruling that out, unless I stumble upon just the right well-cared for pieces. Sometimes I wish I could go back in time and get all of my furniture back so I could “shop my own house” (or would not have moved so many times so I’d still have it all with me ha). I keep thinking about furniture I used to have that would’ve worked great here LOL! Knowing the couch will arrive in a couple of months is motivating me to make a decision. In a small living room where we have family coming and going often, I really need to get the room put together! Click here for above sources There are so many cute chair styles I would like for our living room. I’ve thought about slipcovered chairs since my couch has legs, but a lot of chairs I like have legs! I may slipcover my ottoman, which opens up other options for chairs such as rattan, cane, wood, and upholstered! Click here for sofa source I shared my new striped couch choice in this post. I’m so glad I have the couch decision out of the way (still waiting on delivery) but every decision leads to a new one so I have to keep going :). If I could have all striped furniture I’d be happy haha. Stripes are my favorite pattern, so I would pick stripes on everything if it was acceptable. Striped Spindle Leg Chair (has fabric and finish options) In fact when I saw this darling chair in the same fabric as my couch I paused and thought hmmmm, could I do matching striped fabric? I probably could. But would I? Something to think about. This chair (and many of the others in this post) come in other fabrics. Click here for above sources Usually I prefer to keep furniture in solid neutral fabrics so you can change it with any patterned pillows, but I have two built in benches where I can change patterns so I am not as concerned about it with the furniture (as long as I love the pattern). Perennials Performance Basketweave Light Blue on left // Mist Performance Double Stripe on right I had ordered this blue sample for the couch before I decided the striped pattern was best for us. But the blue looks so pretty with the couch, it would be a nice pairing on any of their chairs. I may decide to go with a creamy / off white fabric since we have blue walls, but I’ve discovered that shades of blues look very soft and pretty in here so I can see the blue working, too. Should I go with two matching chairs? I usually prefer a more collected look, but I can see it either way. As far as any chairs we have, I do still have our two white rattan chairs (see photos of them above a few houses ago), which I really love. But they would need to be re-painted and new cushions made which can be expensive. I don’t know if I can have the paint stripped (I don’t know if you can even strip rattan?). I’m really considering using them in our bedroom though so I would probably prefer to buy new for living room and save those for the bedroom. I also still have this wingback (which is still sold at Ballard Designs) and it is very comfy. If I was going to keep that one in the living room, I would prefer to have it recovered (plus the back got damaged in a move). It could also work in a bedroom, though, so I don’t have to keep the wingback in the living room. I like all of the chair styles I’m sharing in this post, and dozens more I’ve found over the past few weeks. Now to narrow it down to the right one for us and make a decision. :) Which chairs would you choose? The comments are working again so I’d love to hear from you! Click here for above sources Here is a collage of a few things I have or have used in our living room, but I will work on which accessories, pillows and rug make sense after the furniture decisions are made.

But the blue looks so pretty with the couch, it would be a nice pairing on any of their chairs. I may decide to go with a creamy / off white fabric since we have blue walls, but I’ve discovered that shades of blues look very soft and pretty in here so I can see the blue working, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould I go with two matching chairs?

But they would need to be re-painted and new cushions made which can be expensive. I don’t know if I can have the paint stripped (I don’t know if you can even strip rattan?). I’m really considering using them in our bedroom though so I would probably prefer to buy new for living room and save those for the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also still have \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/3EEOqHJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ethis wingback\u003c/a\u003e (which is still sold at \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/3EEOqHJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eBallard Designs\u003c/a\u003e) and it is very comfy. If I was going to keep that one in the living room, I would prefer to have it recovered (plus the back got damaged in a move). It could also work in a bedroom, though, so I don’t have to keep the wingback in the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like all of the chair styles I’m sharing in this post, and dozens more I’ve found over the past few weeks.
