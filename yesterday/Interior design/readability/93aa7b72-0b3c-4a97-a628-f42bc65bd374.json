Maybe you’ve collected a few treasures over the years—or you’re just starting to appreciate the charm of secondhand style. Either way, there’s something special about the character and soul these pieces bring to a home. Below I’m sharing a list of 15 posts on The Inspired Room all about decorating with secondhand finds. This is what we’re talking about this week in the HomeBody Gathering Place community! My daughter Kylee and I shared a fun video “tour” of some of our favorite secondhand finds around our home—each one with a unique story to tell. From meaningful family pieces to charming flea market scores, these items add so much more than just style—they help make a house feel like a sanctuary. Follow @homebodygatheringplace on Instagram We also created a vintage secondhand checklist you can download to guide your own treasure hunts! It’s a curated list of timeless pieces we believe are worth bringing into your home—not just for style, but for the story and soul they add. These are the kinds of items that help transform a house into a sanctuary, without adding clutter. This checklist is just one of the many helpful resources you’ll find inside our HomeBody Gathering Place. If you’ve ever wished your home felt more like you—more peaceful, personal, and pulled together—we’re here to guide you. Through inspiration, tools, and community, you’ll learn to create a home that truly supports and reflects the life you want to live. You can grab the checklist (and so much more!) when you join us.
