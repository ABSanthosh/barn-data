  "text": "The Cortado is a recently completed tiny house designed by Tiny House Listings. It features a minimalist exterior and a straightforward, single-story layout for two people. Built on a 24-foot (7.3 m) double-axle trailer, the Cortado stands out for its increased width of 10 feet (3 m), compared to the standard 8 feet (2.4 m) for most tiny houses. While this extra width means a permit is required for towing, it allows for a more spacious interior. The design does not include many luxury features found in larger models, but it offers essential amenities at a reasonable price. The Cortado follows the design principles of Tiny House Listings’ larger TinyPlex duplex model, focusing on practical living space and affordability. Overall, it provides a simple and comfortable option for those seeking efficient tiny home living. Designer: Tiny House Listings The interior of the home offers a total living space of 240 square feet (22 square meters) and is arranged with an open floor plan to maximize the available area. Entry to the home is through a glass door, which leads directly into the kitchen. While the kitchen is designed to be simple, it is equipped with several essential features to support daily living. There is a compact breakfast bar that seats two people, providing a spot for casual dining or working. The kitchen also includes a sink for meal preparation and clean-up, an electric cooktop suitable for basic cooking needs, a small refrigerator for food storage, and a selection of cabinetry offering space to store kitchen utensils, dishes, and pantry items. The open layout ensures the living area feels as spacious as possible despite the home’s compact footprint, creating a functional and comfortable environment for residents. The living area features a sofa with room for an entertainment center and a coffee table. A mini-split air-conditioning unit is installed to maintain a comfortable temperature throughout the home. The bathroom is accessible through a pocket sliding door and includes a shower, a vanity sink, and a standard flushing toilet, with the option to upgrade to a composting model if needed. For added convenience, the bathroom also comes equipped with a washer and dryer hookup. The layout is designed to be functional, making efficient use of the available space while providing essential amenities for daily living. The bedroom in the Cortado is located opposite the bathroom and offers a surprisingly spacious feel for a tiny house. It includes a double bed and a small seating area, with enough headroom to stand and move comfortably due to the single-floor design. This layout eliminates the need for a loft, making the space more accessible. The Cortado is currently available for purchase, with a starting price of US$61,250. Delivery is offered throughout the United States, making it accessible to buyers nationwide. Both the bedroom and layout provide comfort and practicality in a compact footprint.",
