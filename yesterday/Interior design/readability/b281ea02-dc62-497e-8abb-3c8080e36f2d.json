  "text": "The winners of the 2025 Victorian Architecture Awards, hosted by the Australian Institute of Architects – Victorian Chapter, were announced last night. A total of 19 Named Awards, 21 Architecture Awards, and 17 Commendations were presented across 15 categories from over 350 entries. A theme among this year’s awards were projects highlighting the transformative power of architecture in shaping communities, including the Northern Memorial Park Depot by Searle x Waldron Architecture awarded the prestigious Victorian Architecture Medal. In the Residential Architecture – Houses (Alterations and Additions) category, Dunstan by SSdH took out top honours. Set within Preston’s Newlands Housing Estate, this home embodies the garden city aspirations of the original development, while acknowledging the reality of our changing suburbs. The Named Award in Residential Architecture – Houses (New) was given to Hedge and Arbour House by Studio Bright — described by the jury as a project that deftly reconciles the tension between domestic suburbia and the wild terrain of its bushland reserve below. Nightingale Preston by Breathe Architecture won the Residential Architecture – Multiple Housing category, recognising ​the project as an elevated benchmark for apartment living that prioritises the fundamentals while establishing a lively neighbourhood. In the Interior Architecture category, Melbourne Place by Kennedy Nolan was awarded top honours for its richly layered and meticulously crafted interior, that confidently redefines the experience of a contemporary hotel. Winners of the Named and Architecture Awards will now progress to be considered for the National Architecture Awards.
