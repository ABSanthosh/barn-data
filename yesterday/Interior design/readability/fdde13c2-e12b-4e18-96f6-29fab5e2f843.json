  "text": "A rare and beautifully designed architectural home in Prahran has just hit the market. Originally created by acclaimed design duo Ritz \u0026 Ghougassian as Gilad Ritz’s own home, this striking residence has been carefully maintained by current owners Ben Esakoff and James Vivian, co-owners of the Toorak-based skincare clinic James Vivian. The couple first discovered the home through an unconventional route. ‘We bought this home directly off the previous owners, Gill and Laurelle’ James explains. ‘Gill puts the Ritz in Ritz \u0026 Ghougassian, and this was one of the first homes they created’. ‘Having long admired their work, we sent a message one day saying, “Let us know if you ever want to sell your home.” We purchased it shortly after’ Ben and James share. Defined by its seamless indoor-outdoor connection and strong architectural lines, this residence exudes comfort and tranquillity. Its towering brick walls create a private sanctuary, while the courtyard’s lush greenery brings an organic softness to the structured design. The home is also a testament to quality craftsmanship, with carefully considered details such as heated flooring in winter, abundant built-in storage, and soundproofed interiors that offer complete peace from the bustling world outside. Beyond its striking architecture, the location is an undeniable drawcard. ‘Living metres from Andrew McConnell’s Morning Market is deliciously convenient,’ James admits. Prahran’s vibrant community, with its top-tier restaurants, boutiques, and parklands, is right on the doorstep, offering the perfect blend of urban convenience and residential tranquillity. For Ben and James, selling this home is bittersweet. They moved in towards the end of Melbourne’s lockdowns, drawn to the security and completeness of the space. ‘The need for us to have somewhere reliable, finished, and secure was extremely important to us’ they explain. Now, however, they’re ready for a new challenge—this time, taking on their own renovation project. More than just a house, this is a carefully curated space that has been deeply loved by each of its owners. ‘Rather than missing Highbury Grove, we’ll be forever grateful to have looked after this home for the time that we did’ Ben and James reflect. With its impeccable design and prime location, this property offers a rare chance to own a dream contemporary home in one of Melbourne’s most sought-after suburbs. 39 Highbury Grove Prahran is listed with Kay \u0026 Burton. Expressions of interest close Tuesday 25 March at 5pm.",
