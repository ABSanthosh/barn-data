The Christmas season is officially here. I hosted Thanksgiving and if you have ever done it yourself, you know it is a lot of work…planning, prepping, cooking, cleaning and more. :-) I enjoyed having family all around so it was all worth it. Now that Thanksgiving is behind me along with the whirlwind of events the past few weeks, today is the first day I feel truly relaxed. I plan to finish decorating the house for Christmas and will share it with you this week. This afternoon Ed and I are going to a holiday concert at the Koger Center at the University of South Carolina. I like to attend holiday music events like this as they always get me in the holiday spirit. :-) How about you? Are you getting into the holiday spirit yet? Do you decorate your house, bake cookies and listen to holiday music? If so… Enjoy every minute as the season will fly by. Now onto the links I found this week.
