  "text": "Tiny home-maker Timbercraft Tiny Homes is popular for building luxurious cottage-like models that add some sophistication and refinement to the micro-living movement. Recently, they designed the Hidden Mountain Tiny Villa, which is blessed with a rustic aesthetic, and a spacious and comfortable interior that is well-suited for a family. The tiny home is based on a trailer, and it is available in a 545 sq ft and a 605 sq ft version. Designer: Timbercraft Tiny Homes  This charming tiny home combines classic and modern elements to create a cozy yet functional living space. The exterior is elegantly clad in shiplap, providing a timeless and rustic feel, while the sturdy metal roof ensures durability and adds a contemporary edge. A spacious porch welcomes you, offering an ideal spot for outdoor relaxation and blending seamlessly with the interior. As you enter the home, you are welcomed by a spacious and free-flowing living area. This space is bathed in natural light, owing to the well-placed windows. The L-shaped sofa provides ample seating, making it a perfect spot for lounging or hosting guests. The area also includes a coffee table and an entertainment center. Additional storage solutions have been integrated, and a fireplace adds some warmth and ambiance, enhancing the coziness of this compact haven. The bathroom is located on the ground floor and can be accessed from the kitchen. It features a shower, sink, and a flushing toilet, complemented by additional storage areas to maximize functionality. This model includes two bedrooms designed with comfort and space optimization in mind. The master bedroom is situated on the ground floor, offering ample headroom for standing. It is equipped with a double bed and integrated storage solutions. The second bedroom is found upstairs in the loft, reached via a staircase. It includes a double bed and is characterized by a low ceiling, making it a cozy and intimate sleeping area. The tiny home was originally designed for Timbercraft Tiny Home’s tiny house community called Hidden Mountain Villas in Alabama. The community includes 24 houses. But, the home has grown so popular, that the firm is now manufacturing and selling them to the public. However, we are unaware of the price.",
