  "text": "Christmas is less than a month away, and we’re seeing an influx of creative and passionate designs. Designer Anna Lomax recently unveiled the All Lit Up! glowing Christmas tree-inspired sculpture at the Victoria and Albert Museum’s South Kensington Grand Entrance. The sculpture draws inspiration from the museum’s entryway columns, and it stands tall as an interesting spiraling column that adopts the form of a traditional Christmas tree. Designer: Anna Lomax The installation is whimsical and playful and was created to “evoke the feelings of joy and child-like wonder” and embody the vibrant Christmas spirit. It takes the traditional Christmas tree and adds an amusing and contemporary twist to it, creating something that instantly sparks wonder and curiosity. A rounded metallic plinth serves as the base of the installation, and it is surrounded by four large columns. The base rises upwards in a fascinating spiral, serving as a lovely decorative design illuminated by LED lights. “My design for the 2025 V\u0026A Christmas Tree uses the iconic V\u0026A dome columns as a starting point but gives them an actual playful twist, embodying the ‘Christmas Spirit’ through a spectacle of light,” Lomax said. The installation creates a subtle connection between trees and columns, attempting to “unify the elegance of a tree with the strength of a column”, the museum added. The result is something refreshing and yet traditional. You are reminded of a comforting Christmas tree when you look at the installation, but you also feel curiosity as you observe its fresh new form. “Lighting up and lifting spirits this festive season, we are thrilled to commission Anna Lomax for this year’s V\u0026A Christmas tree installation,” senior curator Meneesha Kellay said. “Delighting visitors with her playful site-specific response, Anna has taken inspiration from the iconic columns in our Grand Entrance.” This mesmerizing installation is a part of the museum’s annual Christmas installations, and it will remain on display till January 5th, 2025. If you want to get into some early festive cheer with a twist, then we would recommend a quick visit to the V\u0026A Museum, if you have the time.",
