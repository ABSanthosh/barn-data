  "description": "This 1970s townhouse in Northcote, Melbourne was looking worse for wear after years on the rental market. A previous renovation hadn’t done the property any favours by introducing an unsympathetic kitchen with a red glass splashback. With the core aim of simplification and reduction, Kerry Kounnapis Architecture Practice (KKAP) stripped the home back to reveal original features and generous spaces, enhanced with modern storage interventions — all of which are beloved by the owners today.",

  "text": "Until its recent makeover, the bones of this 1970s townhouse were well designed, but unloved. ‘The prior owners used it as an investment property, and had undertaken a few superficial renovations to the kitchen and bathroom, however, these interventions weren’t at all sympathetic to the ‘70s character of the villa,’ says Kerry Kounnapis, director or Kerry Kounnapis Architecture Practice (KKAP). Despite these shortcomings, Kerry and his team saw potential in the property, which is part of a wider, small scale-development in Northcote, Melbourne. The 1970s design of the identical townhouses reminded Kerry of acclaimed projects of the era, including Winter Park in Doncaster, designed in the same decade by Graeme Gunn. ‘As soon as I walked in, I was struck by the volume in the main space. I could see the untapped potential and all the inefficiencies in the floor plan,’ he says. ‘We definitely had Graeme Gunn and Kevin Borland buildings in our psyche. We even visited Gunn’s Winter Park in Doncaster to figure out some spatial moves… ‘We wanted to emphasise the volume of the space, strip the years of ill-considered paint on the beams, and bring back the essence of the architecture.’ KKAP reworked the original floor plan without making major structural alterations, adding just 250mm to some rooms to allow for wardrobes. Select doorways were also repositioned to achieve a more rational, flowing floor plan. The biggest element of the project was redesigning the kitchen, which was reoriented and decreased in size for a more efficient use of space overall. Kerry explains, ‘Prior to this, there was barely any room in the villa for a dining table.’ The greatest challenge of the renovation was making the home feel more light-filled, without completely overhauling the original dark timber and brick material palette. The idea of painting the rough sawn ceiling beams white was originally floated, until a more sympathetic alternative was realised. ‘We resisted and had them sanded back (hours of labour on a scaffold!),’ says Kerry. ‘These are the types of decisions that elevate the original intent of the design, rather than hiding it under yet another layer of paint.’ This move in turn inspired the use recycled Oregon timber across the new joinery — most notably to build the statement bookshelf in the open-plan living and dining area. The kitchen, in comparison, was kept minimal and uncluttered, as not to overpower the original 1970s features of the home. ‘It is intentionally painted the same white as the walls to “disappear,” turning the attention to the bookshelf unit where books and collectibles are prioritised and celebrated,’ says Kerry of the kitchen. The renovation also improved the home’s sustainable credentials, introducing remote-operated window openers to enable cross ventilation, an electric under-slab heating system, and a 7kW solar array. ‘Intriguingly, the entire housing block has been gas free since its inception — a forward thinking choice for its time that aligns with today’s sustainability goals,’ says Kerry. The home is now a calming and functional place to be, serving as a refuge away from the owners’ busy professional lives. ‘The proximity of the villa to the Merri Creek means that wildlife sounds are constant… It’s a little oasis in Northcote, and sometimes you’re reminded of its proximity to the city when the tram bells echo in the distance. ‘I truly believe the building was originally intended to be simple, we just bought the simplicity back.’",
