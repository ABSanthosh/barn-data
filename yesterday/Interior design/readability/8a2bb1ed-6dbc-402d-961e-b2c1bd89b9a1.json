  "description": "Among East Melbourne’s landscape of grand terraces and art deco buildings stands an unassuming brick 1970s mid-rise apartment complex. Sometimes described as understated, stoic, and even hostile, those in the know recognise this property (comprising two north-facing buildings) as a thoughtfully-designed home base with a new urban garden at its centre. We took a tour of two of the apartments, owned by house-proud residents who feel lucky to call this slice of inner-city Melbourne home.",
