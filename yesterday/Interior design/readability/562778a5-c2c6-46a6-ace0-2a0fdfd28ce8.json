I took a couple of weeks off to decompress, enjoy family and friends, and find inspiration for all aspects of my life, but mostly ideas to share with you in 2025. Over my holiday break, Ed and I spent Christmas week in Los Angeles with our older daughter Kelly and her family. Christmas spent with the grandkids made up for all the mess we were dealing with back home. We then headed to Charlottesville to spend a few days to celebrate the new year with our youngest, Mandy and her new hubby Matt in Charlottesville. If you read any of my posts right before the holidays you know that we were dealing with no heat on the first floor. We still are! Seems the HVAC techs can’t figure out the fast changing technology or are not trained to deal with the intricacies of all heating systems and thermostats. Luckily we have 2 systems in the house and the second floor one is keeping the temp on the first floor liveable. I am coming out of my holiday break feeling rested and inspired for the new year and ready to get back to my daily routine along with dealing with contractors for a few more weeks until they finish work in the office and living room. Then it is onto the outside where we are having a number of trees taken down so the chances of a tree falling down on our house again in the future lessens. Big Changes in My Kitchen How do you like seeing my Christmas tree in the living room through the plastic sheeting? This is what the kitchen looked like the week before Christmas. The living room was filled with everything from the kitchen so it was not a comfy cozy holiday look or feel for us this year, plus it was chilly. See the section of cabinets where the arrow is pointing? Before the ceiling started to get redone, Ed removed the section of upper cabinets that I have been wanting to remove since the day we moved into the house 9 years ago. Since the kitchen ceiling was getting redone because of tree damage, the time was right to remove the cabinets. From this view of the kitchen the row of cabinets doesn’t look so bad. But from the back, not so nice. This is the view when you enter the house from the garage. It’s a blockade and made the hallway very dark. If you remember, I termed it “the hallway of darkness“. Bye-bye cabinets. Hello to an open, more spacious look and feel. After the cabinets were down, the popcorn ceiling was removed and new sheetrock put up. Coming into the house now looks so much better, even before the ceiling paint was rolled on. No more blockage! We had to add a piece of wood to close the side of the wall cabinets since the cabinet on the wall and the ones we removed were custom built as one seamless wall/corner cabinet. The other section that needed to be filled-in was the counter section where the support for the cabinet we removed was set into the counter. We filled it in with wood and wood filler, then sanded smooth. I still have to repaint the area to seamlessly match the existing Carrara Marble look that I painted on the counter quite a few years ago. I love the view from the foyer to the kitchen as it looks more spacious. I also like that we can close off the studioffice from the kitchen or the kitchen from the foyer by closing the pocket doors in each doorway. On the far wall around the door to the studioffice I am going to be putting up the stacked stone wallpaper that I added to the dining area of the kitchen. To finish up the kitchen I also need to finish caulking and painting the crown molding on the cabinets that we had to remove for the ceiling to be redone. I am not a pro with putting up crown molding, but like to keep what my son-in-law Matt says….“Caulk and paint will make what it ain’t.” :-) Once I get the room done, I will share more photos and details with you. Then it is on to getting the studioffice turned into a multi-purpose room. It is starting to look very nice. So stay tuned. Happy 2025! Post navigation",
