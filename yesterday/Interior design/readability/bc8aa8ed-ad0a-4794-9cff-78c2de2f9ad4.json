  "text": "Handheld gaming PCs are obviously powerful enough to play AAA games, at least with settings tuned down a bit, so they’d theoretically be powerful enough to drive other regular software unrelated to gaming. Even the Steam Deck with its rather aged hardware is more than capable of serving as a mini PC, whether you’re running Linux or even Windows. Of course, the problem is that these designs are meant to be held in your hands, making them harder to use as a regular computer. You could, of course, connect peripherals to the gaming handheld, like an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse. That works when you’re at home or in the office, but not so much when on the go. This chunky-looking 3D printed case for the Steam Deck tries to offer a rather creative solution to the problem by having space for a keyboard, effectively turning the portable gaming computer into a tiny laptop in a snap, just in case you need a more productive use for the powerful handheld PC. Designer: Justinas Jakubovskis (Natter_LT) Carrying around a Bluetooth keyboard and a mouse isn’t exactly too much of an inconvenience, but using them without a desk is next to impossible. This 3D printed case solve that problem by having a Logitech Pebble Keys 2 keyboard and the Steam Deck as a single unit, though the narrow kickstand might still be a problem when it comes to placing the tiny laptop on your lap. You also still have to make do with a 7.4-inch screen, which is a bit usable but not exactly comfortable or ergonomic. Of course, this doesn’t stop you from using the Steam Deck as a gaming handheld. You just need to pop it out of the hardshell case to be able to hold it in your hands again. But for games you prefer to play with a keyboard and a mouse, this laptop-like configuration will be more to your liking. Yes, you might want to use a mouse for that purpose, but the Steam Deck’s trackpads might be fine when you don’t have a table to play on. The case has cutouts for the Steam Deck’s ports so you have access to them even while the device is in the case. As for that mouse, there’s also a 3D-printed “backpack” for the case that can hold that peripheral as well as charging brick, further transforming the Steam Deck into a portable workstation. Another add-on is a 3D printed carrying handle that really drives home that portability image. You’re doing to look rather odd when using it as a laptop, but very few people will be able to brag about having such a portable gaming computer anyway. The STL files for 3D printing the case are being sold for around $9.50, unlike the usual free handouts that other designers give. That’s still rather cheap compared to buying a Steam Deck carrying case that doesn’t have space for a keyboard at all, but only if you have access to a 3D printer. Otherwise, the costs do add up, but you probably won’t see such a custom-made case for a Steam Deck laptop in the market anyway.",
