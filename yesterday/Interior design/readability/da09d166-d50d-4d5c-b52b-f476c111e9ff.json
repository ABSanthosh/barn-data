I hope all is well in your world. I am happy to report that we finally have heat back on all through the house again and just in time for the freezing temps and snow storm that came through the south last week. In the 9 years we have lived in South Carolina, we have only had 2 winter storms where there was only a dusting of snow on hard surfaces and was gone in a few hours. Last week we got 2 inches that has stayed on the ground. It was our first time seeing real snow cover since moving into the house. It looked so pretty all around the lake. This weekend Ed and I headed to the Orlando area to spend the weekend to celebrate Ed’s best friend’s 69th bday. There is no snow here, but it is COLD! Even with the cold we are having a good time. We left early this morning to get back home so Ed can watch the Eagles play at 3:00. We are hoping they win. Now onto the links I found this week. Posts You May Have Missed This Week: Giving a room in my home a new purpose. (open in same tab) Something to Think About This article made so much sense to me. Minimalism changed who I am. (open in same tab) When I read this (below) earlier this week, I nodded to myself as I do the same thing when looking at home: Interior lighting in a home is everything!!! “Whenever my husband and I walk through the city, especially streets with brownstones where you can see the apartments, we look for the coziest, well-lit homes. And for those with harsh lighting, we can’t help but think how much happier and more relaxed they would be if they used warm light bulbs on dimmers and maybe added a few strands of twinkle lights during the winter months.” – Annie Diamond from Most Lovely Things (open in same tab) If you enjoy these posts – You can find past Style Scouting posts here.
