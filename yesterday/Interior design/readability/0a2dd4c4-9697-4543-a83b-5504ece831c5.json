This landmark exhibition celebrates LAYER's 10-year anniversary with a curated retrospective of the studio's decade-long work, alongside the new, and thought-provoking 101010 collection. The new collection comprises six innovative social design prototypes created in collaboration with leading design and fashion brands that LAYER has partnered with over the past decade. The transformative showcase blends art, technology, fashion, craftsmanship, and sustainable innovation, exploring how design can shape tomorrow's world.\"It's been 10 years since I founded LAYER – and it's an honour to collaborate with some of our long-standing creative partners from the past decade to celebrate craft and explore how design can solve some of the most pressing issues facing humanity in the near future,\" says Benjamin Hubert, founder of LAYER. \"With this exhibition, we are not just reflecting on a decade of transformative design; we are imagining how design can inspire and adapt to the challenges of an ever-evolving world. This exhibition is an invitation to rethink the role of design in our shared future.\"The exhibition will be held at the iconic Milanese creative hub 10 Corso Como, in the new Project Room gallery, from 7th to 13th April 2025. Past, Present and FutureThe 101010 exhibition offers a unique dual narrative. It presents a curated retrospective of LAYER's prolific decade-long journey, featuring celebrated collaborations with brands such as Bang \u0026 Olufsen, Nike, Moroso, and Vitra. This retrospective is supported by a display of the 2022 monograph on the studio published by Phaidon and written by design curator and commentator Max Fraser.It also marks the launch of a new collection of six prototypes crafted in partnership with industry leaders that LAYER has partnered with in the past: Andreu World, Bitossi Ceramiche, Kvadrat, MDF Italia, Muuto, RÆBURN, and Orrefors. These prototypes tackle pressing global challenges, from urban density and resource scarcity to environmental resilience and sustainable living and decodes them with analogue solutions. The title of the exhibition – 101010 – is a nod to the past decade, the decade to come, and the iconic location of 10 Corso Como. The 6 prototypes showcased celebrate ingenuity and resilience, inviting us to envision a world where creativity leads, technology serves, and design remains profoundly human.Stretching the length of 10 Corso Como's Project Room, the exhibition will transform the space into an immersive environment. Suspended translucent banners adorned with LAYER's signature watercolour artworks create a dramatic visual impact, while displays of prototypes–some never-before-seen–along with material samples, production designs, and evocative concepts highlight the studio's design process and ethos. Visitors are guided along a central walkway that culminates in a display of the new 101010 collection. New Collection The new 101010 collection comprises six groundbreaking prototypes, each created in collaboration with one of the studio's past creative partners. Each piece showcases the craft capabilities of the brand and offers a forward-thinking response to the challenges of tomorrow. The collection emphasises sustainable, craft-driven solutions and celebrates the innovative and ambitious design thinking and engineering that LAYER has become known for.

These prototypes tackle pressing global challenges, from urban density and resource scarcity to environmental resilience and sustainable living and decodes them with analogue solutions. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"6156e_2163\" data-ic-marker=\"66acae_1366\"\u003eThe title of the exhibition – \u003ci\u003e101010\u003c/i\u003e – is a nod to the past decade, the decade to come, and the iconic location of 10 Corso Como. The 6 prototypes showcased celebrate ingenuity and resilience, inviting us to envision a world where creativity leads, technology serves, and design remains profoundly human.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"7a0df4_9703\" data-ic-marker=\"6d426e_5391\"\u003eStretching the length of 10 Corso Como\u0026#39;s Project Room, the exhibition will transform the space into an immersive environment.
