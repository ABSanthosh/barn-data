  "description": "A British startup called Longbow Motors, formed by ex-Tesla and -Lucid employees, aims to create lightweight EVs that harken back to traditional British sports cars. They've unveiled two of their designs, a no-windshield Speedster and a fixed-roof Roadster, that seem to blur the line between footwear design and automotive design: Longbow calls these aluminum-framed designs \"an entirely new species: the Featherweight Electric Vehicle (FEV).\" The company is obsessed with making the cars as lightweight as possible, and claim the Speedster will be 895 kg (1,973 lbs), the Roadster 995 kg (2,193 lbs). \"Adding lightness is the open secret to true speed — not just in a straight line, but in every nuance of motion. Weight invites complexity, blunts agility and dulls the senses.\" \"Speed, agility and safety are inseparable — each shaped by the artistry of lightweight engineering.\"With 0-62 mph figures in the mid-3-second range for both cars, Longbow hopes the vehicles will deliver \"nimble agility and near-weightless poise, evoking the effortless thrill that defined Britain's most legendary sports cars.\" Both vehicles are projected to have a range around 275 miles. The Speedster is expected to retail for £84,995 (USD $110,009) , while the Roadster is a bit easier on the wallet at £64,995 (USD $84,123). Longbow says the hand-built cars will be on the market next year.",
