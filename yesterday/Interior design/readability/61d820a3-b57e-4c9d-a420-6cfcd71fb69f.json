  "text": "2001 was a phenomenal year for movies. Shrek, Harry Potter (the first one), Fast and the Furious, Monsters Inc., Rush Hour 2, Oceans Eleven, Bridget Jones’ Diary. Imagine all these cult classics in the span of one year. It’s inconceivable to have so many great films release in the same year in today’s day and age. Take Monsters, Inc. for starters – just the premise itself – monsters appearing in kids bedrooms to make them scream because their entire world runs on the energy emitted by a child’s screams. It’s pure art – a child screams, it fills up a battery, and that’s used to power the monster world. We’ll probably never get films as great as that again, but nostalgia is a powerful tool, and so is the LEGO brick. Recreating perhaps one of the most iconic elements of Monsters, Inc. is Pester78’s rendition of Boo’s door. The way it worked in the movie was that doors were portals to the human world. The Monsters, Incorporated company had a replica of every single door to every child’s bedroom on the planet. Doors docked into a rig, portals got activated, monsters went about scaring children, while the screams of kids charged a battery cell attached to the rig. Pester78’s LEGO recreation rebuilds this rig with immaculate detail, capturing the most pivotal and memorable moment of the entire movie! Designer: Pester78 The entire rig is designed to move with stunning accuracy, replicating the movie frame for frame. Boo’s door docks into the rig, which gets secured by two mechanical jaws on either side. Unlike most LEGO builds which are purely static, this one is as animated as they come, with moving parts that almost feel like you’re watching the movie. The colors, patterns, proportions are perfect, and those flowers on Boo’s door are *chef’s kiss*. The door locking mechanism works like it should. It clamps, it moves, it feels like it belongs in the actual factory. The scream canister isn’t decorative—it’s part of the system. Control panels, mechanical arms, exposed cabling, and that deliciously chaotic Pixar industrial design all show up without apology. You can practically hear the dull hum of the factory floor and the screech of a door being slotted into place, with Roz’s droning voice in the background being an absolute caricature of the bureaucracy-loving secretary who wouldn’t resist complaining about you not following protocol. It’s funny how something as simple as a door can evoke the level of nostalgia as this build does. It has no characters, no Sulley, no Mike, no Randall, not even tiny Boo, Yet it commands such strong memories. I’m probably going to rewatch Monsters, Inc. just after this! And I guess that’s a victory for this MOC (My Own Creation). There’s no official part count yet, but eyeballing it, you’re looking at 800 to maybe 1000 pieces. Not massive, but enough to make you work for it. Enough to make you sit down, dump the bags out, and hear Randy Newman’s score creeping into your head whether you like it or not. The build is aimed squarely at people who care—Pixar nerds, LEGO nerds, anyone who remembers Boo calling Sulley “Kitty” like it was yesterday. Pester78’s creation is currently a submission on the LEGO Ideas forum, where independent LEGO builders share their creative work, while the broader LEGO community votes for their favorite designs. With over 3,000 votes and 589 days till the voting ends, this particular kit is surely on its way to hitting the 10,000 vote mark, following which it’ll get sent to LEGO’s internal team for review and hopefully turned into a box set… perhaps with movie characters to complete the scene! You can vote for the ‘Monsters, Inc. – Boo’s Door Scream Floor’ build on the LEGO Ideas website here.",
