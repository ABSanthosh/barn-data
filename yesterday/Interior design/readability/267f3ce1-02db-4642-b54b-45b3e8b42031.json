All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.In small spaces, you often find yourself giving up on the idea of having an entryway table, or forgoing end tables or nightstands. It can be hard to add extra furniture pieces when you’re already short on floor space, and of course, you don’t want to sacrifice style for utility. Luckily, there’s a solution: I found a table that fulfills all these purposes, saves you floor space, and is one of the most stylish furniture pieces I’ve seen yet. The Ferm LIVING Curvature Wall Table is “inspired by jewelry,” and that’s clear on the first look. The beautiful, shiny brass table has a small flat top and a cute squiggly leg below it, and it comes in two colors — black and original brass. Whether you go for the shiny original gold sheen of brass or the darker patina of the black version, this table is just as much about form as it is about function, as its description makes clear. If you’ve never heard of Ferm, it’s a Copenhagen-based company that creates furniture with a focus on sustainability and creativity, collaborating with artisans around the world. Its lineup reflects this — every one of their products looks like an art piece!The first thing I think when I see the table is “sturdy.” Despite the fact that it’s just over 3 pounds (I thought the box was empty when I first took it off the porch), the Curvature Wall Table holds up well, and with care, it will probably last a good number of years. However, it can collect a few scratches — while it’ll never fall off the wall, and it will hold everything up, you might want to invest in some sandpaper to buff them away. At $269, it has a steep price tag, but the make and design make it well worth it. It goes directly onto the wall, so it takes a little more work to install than your usual nightstand/entryway table, but once it’s set up, it’s absolutely gorgeous. For me, it’s perfect right by the entryway, where I’m looking to add a little basket to drop my keys and other bits and bobs into. I have a feeling it’s quickly going to become one of my favorite furniture pieces.",
