  "text": "Every corner whispers calm in the serene villa designed by Ambience Interior. Every detail celebrates elegance, and every room is reminiscent of the natural vibe outdoors. As light pours in through the expansive windows and soft neutral tones meet clean lines, a serene, timeless ambiance is created. This evokes feelings similar to the ones you’d have walking through a calm forest—but in an understated way. A narrow corridor with a wooden floor leads you into the home, with the glass door reflecting nature outdoors. The living room features a chunky modular sofa. A leather cushion adds the right amount of outdoorsy green. We especially love the built-in, glass-enclosed fireplace and stacked firewood display—adding a considerable degree of warmth. The entertainment complex is nice and simple, and features a light oakwood shelving unit. The kitchen, again, is understated. A neutral color palette dominates the space. This is complemented by a black kitchen island and pendant lights. The gold legs for the bar stools easily factor in luxury. The dining area—adjacent to the kitchen and living space in this open-concept plan—features a large table, rattan chairs, and circular pendant lights. The floor-to-ceiling windows would make you feel like you’re dining amidst nature. The staircase is curved and simple, but a small illuminated console makes sure to create a decorative statement. The bedrooms in the serene villa are modern, but make sure to maintain that connection with Mother Nature. We see hints of sage green in the color palette, as well as layered bedding for a cozy vibe. A double vanity makes sure the space is visually intriguing. The room built in the loft should be space-savvy—and that’s achieved with a floating bed and minimal accessories. The space does take advantage of all the light it receives by incorporating a work desk, though! The bathrooms in this home use green and teal textured accents on the wall. The bathroom in the loft features a wall-mounted toilet and compact shower cubicle—the glass partition of which keeps the space feeling airy. The master bathroom goes all out, though. There’s a double vanity with gold hardware, accent walls, and a freestanding bathtub. Everything you’d imagine in a dream spa-like bathroom! The serene villa provides all necessary amenities, within the borders of the home! You can find a home gym and yoga area. This, along with two loungers for resting as well as a coffee station, are housed in a large, wood-paneled room. A tinted glass does offer partition, though. Finally, we see a glass-enclosed sauna—great for rejuvenation!",
