  "text": "Little By Little Card Game builds Trust in Post-Housing CareLittle By Little is a conversational card game designed to facilitate trust-building between previously unhoused individuals and their housing service providers, including case managers, social workers, and therapists. The game incorporates trauma-informed prompts to promote meaningful connections, addressing the role of trust in breaking the cycle of homelessness.Developed by Chicago-based industrial designer Joyce Lai in collaboration with graphic designer Dana Su, the game features a deck of 72 cards and accommodates 2 to 12 players. Participants take turns drawing cards clockwise until all prompts are addressed. The design incorporates pastel tones and organic blob-like shapes to create a welcoming and approachable aesthetic. The cards are designed with user accessibility in mind, featuring rounded corners for ease of handling and bilingual prompts in English and Spanish to support a diverse range of participants.all images courtesy of Joyce Lai DesignFostering Trust and Connection Through Thoughtful DesignResearch from the National Healthcare for the Homeless Council highlights that establishing trust in post-housing care often takes 2 to 3 years, a key factor linked to improved recovery rates by up to 30%. To address this, designer Joyce Lai collaborated with HousingPlus, a Brooklyn-based housing organization, to conduct user interviews and co-creation workshops. These sessions revealed a strong need for connection while balancing personal boundaries, informing the development of the game’s prompts to ensure they are engaging, non-intrusive, and trauma-sensitive.The game seeks to streamline trust-building by fostering open communication and interaction in a structured, supportive environment. Its design challenges the assumption that housing alone can address homelessness, emphasizing the importance of human connection and mutual trust as critical components of recovery. Little By Little presents a practical and innovative tool for enhancing post-homelessness care through thoughtful, inclusive design.Little By Little is designed to foster trust between unhoused individuals and their housing service providersthe game features a deck of 72 cards and supports 2 to 12 playersthe game facilitates meaningful conversations using trauma-informed promptsthe design features pastel tones and blob-like shapes for an approachable aesthetic",
