  "text": "For our latest lookbook, we've selected eight windowless or low-light bedrooms illuminated with the help of strategically placed cutouts and clever layout solutions. Bedrooms without windows are normally seen as less attractive, but these projects show how a windowless bedroom can be made cosy and light. Whilst most of these bedrooms don't have their own windows, they have been strategically placed in buildings with multiple windows or skylights nearby, which creates striking sculptural interiors and means they still get some light. This is the latest in our lookbooks series, which provides visual inspiration from Dezeen's archive. For more inspiration, see previous lookbooks featuring blank windowless buildings and small bedrooms that utilise limited space.

The skylights project natural light into the whole of the house, which is divided by concrete walls to define the different zones of the living space, kitchen and bedroom.

Natural light illuminates the house throughout from skylights in its ceilings. Utilising skylights instead of multiple windows gives the house a \"cathedral feeling and proportion on the inside, with light entering everywhere from the top,\" Godefroy said.

It features sunken multi-purpose rooms that can be used as bedrooms. Glazed openings in the middle of each floor allow light to travel down from the skylight overhead.

Wrapped in wood-framed sliding glass doors, the home can be opened up to its surrounding landscape. It was designed for a client who wanted \"a clear view to the ocean and wind flowing through all day long,\" the studio said.

On the floor below, large living spaces have floor-to-ceiling windows to illuminate the home's minimalist design. \"Simple solutions were sought in terms of spaces and materials to achieve what is difficult to define or explain,\" architect Joana Nunes said.

Featuring a rounded archway at its entrance and a slightly elevated floor, the sleeping nook doesn't suffer from not having a window, but serves as a snug and restful bedroom.
