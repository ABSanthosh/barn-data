  "text": "John Cena may be a world-class wrestler and a phenomenal actor… but if there’s anything the internet will eternally remember him for, it’s for the fact that he’s actually invisible. The former WWE champion’s famous line “You Can’t See Mee” that he says before pulling his signature move the Five Knuckle Shuffle suddenly turned into an everlasting meme, with people just casually pretending he’s invisible. Fans would post photos with John Cena only to have the comments section filled with “why are you standing alone in that photo?” It’s a joke as old as time, and for a long while it’s been just that unavoidably evergreen internet joke, but Mattel took an opportunity to turn it into something real. Just yesterday, Mattel announced an all-transparent version of the John Cena figure, built entirely around his “You Can’t See Me” joke. When I say transparent, I mean absolutely transparent. There isn’t a shred of paint or any graphic on the figurine. It’s entirely see-through as if it was sculpted out of ice, and Mattel’s chosen the perfect time to announce the figure ahead of Cena’s last-ever wrestling performance this year. Designer: Mattel When I say the action figure is transparent, I mean it in every sense. Usual figures have metal screws or springs holding the joints together, but the transparent John Cena figure resorts to an entirely plastic build with strictly transparent pieces. The joints (where you’d usually find a mix of components) are completely transparent, although you can see that Mattel uses different grades of plastic for different parts of the figure. The face is clearly a little more cloudy than the torso (maybe to highlight John’s facial features). The set features a figure with two extra heads, a cap, a chain, and an extra pair of hands so you can have him enact the famous prelude to his Five Knuckle Shuffle move. There’s no word on any official launch date or pricing, but Mattel’s leaked promo images along with what the box will look like. It’s labeled ‘Collector’s Edition’, which means it’s probably going to be limited to a small batch of production units. Although Mattel should have launched the transparent John Cena figure years ago when the wrestler was in his prime, now seems like the next-best time for this release. Cena officially retires from wrestling at the end of this year, which brings to conclusion his 25-year-long wrestling career. The 16-time world champion will see his final performance probably at a WWE pay-per-view sometime this year, although he’s still set to appear in WWE videogames in the future. He might be retiring from wrestling, but you’ll still probably see him in movies in the near future. Or maybe you won’t. He’s invisible after all, no?",
