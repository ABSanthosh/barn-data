If you’re anything like me, you love keeping your eyes peeled on home design trends — but you know it’s even better when you get to be the trendsetter. To beat the curve on style this year, we spoke to a handful of designers and interior experts about the trends they’re most excited about this year. Here’s what they said:Credit: zhihao/Getty Images1. Custom MetalworkDesigners say that personal, unique kitchens are making a big statement in 2025. Now, homeowners are getting more focused on the details to create their own spaces instead of following a trend to a T that will be outdated a few months later. With this said, one of the trends Paul Kropp, the COO and cofounder of Bakes \u0026 Kropp Fine Cabinetry, says is coming next year (that I cannot wait for) is custom metalwork. “I think we’ll see a lot more custom metalwork in the kitchen overall such as with hardware, backsplashes, shelving, and more,” he says. “It introduces a level of craftsmanship and elegance that’s hard to replicate with mass-produced materials. Its tactile beauty adds depth and texture to the space and gives a distinctive, high-end feel that elevates the overall design.”Credit: ismagilov/Getty Images/iStockphoto2. Two-Toned CabinetryColorful kitchens are said to be hotter than ever in 2025, and Barbara Vargas, a specialist at home design brand Nobilia, says you can expect to see a lot more two-toned cabinetry in kitchens this year because of their design effect. “Two-tone cabinetry is also gaining traction for its ability to add depth and layers to the kitchen design,” she says. “By combining contrasting colors or materials, such as darker lower cabinets with lighter upper ones, designers can create a balanced and dynamic visual effect.”3. Luxe-Inspired DesignsIf you’re on board for the “old money” trend going around, then your 2025 kitchen will become your favorite room in the whole house. One of the expected trends for next year, according to Camilla Masi, an interior designer at Otto Tiles \u0026 Design, is luxe-inspired spaces. “It’s not a new trend, but is an evolution of both the quiet luxury and biophilic-inspired interior trends, which gained popularity during the pandemic,” she says. Credit: Jennifer Chase4. Smarter CabinetrySmarter cabinetry is expected to rise next year with more integrated use of your cabinets other than storing pots and pans, says Carolyn Cerminara of Cerminara Design. “For 2025, kitchens are evolving into spaces that are just as stylish as they are practical,” she says. “Cabinetry is becoming smarter and more functional, with clever features like pull-out spice racks, hidden coffee stations, and custom inserts that simplify daily life. Sculleries and hidden appliance storage rooms are also a trend that’s here to stay.”",
