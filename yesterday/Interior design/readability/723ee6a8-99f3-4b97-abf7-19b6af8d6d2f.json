  "text": "A new kind of lounge chair is set to change the way we think about working from home. The Encore armchair, engineered by Bateman Labs, is setting a fresh benchmark for modular furniture with its magnetic arms and removable worksurface. Designed for people who crave a seamless blend of function and comfort, this chair is intended to be a flexible station for productivity and leisure. In an era where home offices are everywhere, this is a chair that adapts to your rhythm, not the other way around. The star feature is the magnetic mounting system. Instead of clunky hardware or visible brackets, the Encore relies on concealed magnets to attach a worksurface to the arms. When not needed, the surface simply snaps onto the back of the chair, leaving the silhouette clean and uncluttered. This makes it easy to transition from focused work to relaxed lounging without rearranging your living space. The movement is effortless, the intention clear: your home should work for you, not become a source of friction. Designer: Bateman Labs The chair is available in solid white oak or walnut, paired with a choice of five fabric colors. The finish is warm and tactile, echoing classic Craftsman influences while still feeling contemporary and minimal. The lines are simple but deliberate, blending into a range of interiors without demanding attention. It’s furniture that feels at ease in a quiet reading corner or a dynamic living room, equally ready for a quick video call or a long weekend gaming session. The armchair is integrated with a sense of purpose. The Encore understands that modern living isn’t neatly segmented. Instead, it supports the fluidity of daily life—work, play, rest—without forcing you to compromise on comfort or style. Whether you’re attaching a desk for remote meetings, sketching, or simply eating lunch, the chair accommodates without fuss. When the workday is done, everything tucks away, and you’re left with a classic lounge chair that invites you to unwind. Bateman Labs has also focused on adaptability and longevity. The Encore is more than a trend-driven novelty. Its modular design hints at future accessories and upgrades, ensuring that the chair grows with your needs. For those who invest in their home environment, this is a piece that can evolve alongside changing routines and technologies. It’s not just about ergonomic performance, but about creating an environment that feels personal and enduring. In a crowded market of “work from home” solutions, the Encore armchair delivers utility and elegance in equal measure. It strips away the excess, focusing on the essentials that matter: comfort, adaptability, and a sense of belonging in the home. The result is a chair that doesn’t shout for attention, but quietly transforms the way you move through your day. If you’re looking for a smarter and more beautiful way to work and live, then this magnetic lounge chair will deliver a new way of modern living.",
