  "text": "The Collingwood home of ceramicist Samantha McIntyre of The Soda Fountain, and Sullivan+Strumpf communications coordinator Elsa Bryant is a ‘beautiful compromise’ from the housemates’ previous Fitzroy home. Not wanting to move too far away, but seeking a fresh environment, they discovered this nearby converted warehouse for rent that provided the ideal contrast. ‘The wide, open mezzanine and high ceilings drew us in and we immediately knew where everything would go,’ says Samantha. In this more contemporary space, Samantha and Elsa’s existing furniture and art has a completely different feel. They’ve moved pieces around to find the perfect fit, focusing on feng shui principles and encouraging an open and relaxing atmosphere. Comfort is key, as Samantha explains, ‘Being able to sit on the couch and talk to each other whilst someone is cooking or making a coffee is a favourite thing of mine.’ She adds, ‘We realised we didn’t want the TV anymore as it felt nicer having each space as a place to chat and read.’ There’s also plenty of Samantha’s signature checkered ceramics on display, and no shortage of chairs (which Samantha loves collecting) to accommodate friends who make the house come alive. The memories Samantha and Elsa have made in the home is what they hold dearest. When asked to recall a favourite pastime, Samantha says, ‘Sitting outside in our little courtyard with a wine and hilarious conversation, our cats hanging out with us, before going to see Max Richter — or simply having coffee every morning with each other. ‘I love our coffee conversations and look forward to it every day.’",
