  "text": "Levito redefines expectations for furniture design, presenting itself as much more than a chair, it’s a bold statement piece that bridges art and functionality. Designed for installations and exhibitions, Levito challenges perceptions, inviting viewers to engage with its dual-sensory experience. This innovative creation transforms a simple act, like sitting, into an exploration of balance and contrast. At first glance, Levito’s design may seem unstable, even precarious. Its structure consists of two separate components connected by wires, giving the impression of fragility. This visual uncertainty is an intentional artistic choice, crafted to spark curiosity and encourage deeper engagement. Despite appearances, Levito is structurally sound, providing tactile comfort and stability. This intentional contrast, visual instability versus physical reliability, forms the heart of Levito’s identity. Designer: Choi Pil-jae and kmuid graduate Levito offers a two-stage experience that separates perception from interaction. Initially, viewers are drawn to its striking aesthetic, questioning its usability and marveling at its unconventional construction. This stage engages the mind, encouraging curiosity about its functionality. The second stage begins when one sits on Levito. Here, its true ingenuity shines: the interconnected parts allow for a subtle, fluid sway along its axis, evoking the sensation of floating on a cloud. This gentle motion surprises and delights, transforming skepticism into trust. By emphasizing this interplay between appearance and experience, Levito elevates itself from furniture to an experiential design piece. It challenges users to reconsider traditional notions of function and aesthetics, offering a sensory journey that blurs the boundaries between art and utility. Levito’s unique form and functionality make it ideal for galleries, exhibitions, or modern living spaces, where it seamlessly integrates bold artistic expression with everyday practicality. For those who value innovative design, Levito is more than an object; it’s an invitation to explore the relationship between comfort and curiosity. It embodies the idea that furniture can be more than utilitarian—it can provoke thought, inspire wonder, and deliver delight. By merging visual intrigue with tactile pleasure, Levito sets a new standard in furniture design, offering an experience that is as engaging as it is functional. Whether admired for its artistry or appreciated for its comfort, Levito transforms the way we interact with the objects in our lives.",
