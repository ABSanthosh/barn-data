  "text": "Local studio Form Us With Love has transformed its waterfront workplace into a bistro for Stockholm Design Week, where visitors can meet, eat and \"actually use and test\" the furniture on display. The project is the second iteration of Testing Grounds, an installation that Form Us With Love debuted at last year's Stockholm Design Week by reconfiguring its studio as a future workplace prototype. Form Us With Love has transformed its Stockholm studio into a buzzy bistro. Photo courtesy of Form Us With LoveThis year, the space is being used to present design collaborations with lighting manufacturer Blond, furniture brand +Halle and modular shelving specialist String. It was also transformed into a meeting and eating hub to make use of the studio's existing open-plan kitchen, Form Us With Love co-founder Jonas Pettersson told Dezeen. +Halle is debuting its Nest Club Chair\"We have this long-term culture of cooking together every Wednesday,\" he said. \"About half a year ago, someone said during that lunch, maybe we should start a restaurant, in the way that you'd say 'maybe we should start a band'.\" \"Then we started talking about what kind of cuisine we would have, what we would be drinking, how we would decorate it,\" Pettersson continued. \"So we thought we would do a prototype for Stockholm Design Week.\" Clusters of tables and chairs create a restaurant-style experience. Photo courtesy of Form Us With LoveForm Us With Love arranged clusters of white tables and metal Torno chairs, a former collaboration with +Halle, across the studio to provide bistro-style seating for diners. +Halle is debuting its Nest Club Chair – an enveloping red armchair that adds pops of colour to the otherwise \"austere\" space, explained Pettersson. The studio is illuminated by thin, red-accented lighting created with Blond. Called Catena, the customisable lighting components can be both suspended and wall-mounted together or as standalone objects. \"The idea is that interior designers can play around with single pieces or a system,\" said Pettersson. Form Us With Love clad the central kitchen unit in white-hued perforated metal storage to create a drinks bar. The adaptable storage, called Center Center, was previously created with String and is now available in a series of colours. Considering the decision to present the design collaborations in a functional space where interacting with the pieces is actively encouraged, Pettersson said, \"it's nice that you can actually use and test them\". Blond lighting and String storage also features in the interior design\"Products on podiums are interesting in some ways,\" he reflected. \"But it's interesting to see how people experience things. We can design something, but we can't dictate how it's going to be used. So this place is a testing ground for us to see.\" Inviting illustrations of wine glasses, food and furniture characterise the studio windows, adding a playful contrast to the utilitarian interiors. The bistro is holding multiple dinners and other events throughout Stockholm Design Week. The photography is by Jonas Lindström, unless stated otherwise. Stockholm Design Week 2025 is taking place at various locations around the city from 3 to 9 February. To see what's on, visit Dezeen Events Guide. Subscribe to our newsletters Your email address New!
