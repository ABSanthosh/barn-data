  "description": "This month Axiom Space, the private aerospace company partnered with NASA, revealed their Prada-designed next generation spacesuit. Though a disguised version of the suit was shown last year, now they've unveiled the real deal, fittingly at an event in Milan. It's officially called the Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit (AxEMU) spacesuit, and as you'd guess it's pretty darn stylish:You're undoubtedly wondering what I am, which is why on Earth (er, in space) is Prada involved? Axiom says the fashion brand's \"in-depth knowledge and experience on materials and production processes supported innovative work…. Prada's expertise enabled advanced technologies and innovative sewing methods to bridge the gap between highly engineered functionality and an aesthetically appealing white outer layer, providing astronauts with an increased level of comfort while improving the materials' performance.\"To hear Prada CMO Lorenzo Bertelli tell it: \"Going beyond our limits is one of the company's values that perfectly reflects the spirit of the Prada brand and my parents' vision. I'm very proud of the result we're showing today, which is just the first step in a long-term collaboration with Axiom Space. We've shared our expertise on high-performance materials, features, and sewing techniques, and we learned a lot. I'm sure we'll continue to explore new challenges, broaden our horizons, and build new scenarios together.\"The space threads deviate from Prada's usual runway offerings in more ways than one: Firstly they'll be used in a lunar environment during NASA's upcoming Artemis III mission. Secondly, the spacesuit will actually fit normal human beings, as opposed to runway models: \"The suit accommodates a wide range of crewmembers, including males and females from the first to 99th percentile (anthropomorphic sizing).\" In the video below, the development team discusses the suit's design and intended functionality.",
