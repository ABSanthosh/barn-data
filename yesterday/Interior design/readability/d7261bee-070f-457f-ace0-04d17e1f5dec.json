What is now regarded as a key work of the 20th century was a scandal at its premiere in 1952. Many people were unable to bear the silence without shuffling chairs, coughing and whispering. Had the audience embraced the experience, they might have realised what the neuroscientist Luciano Bernardi discovered almost 50 years later in a study: no piece of music or noise is as calming as silence.Recognising the challenges of open-plan offices, the Berlin Acoustics team has developed solutions to boost workplace concentrationThe sound of silenceIt is, therefore, a misconception that noise is best fought with noise in open-plan offices and public spaces. The sound of ocean waves, birdsong or soft songs through headphones does not optimally enhance concentration. Berlin Acoustics, founded in 2022, has recognised the problem and specialises in the development of innovative acoustic solutions. The soundproofed booths in various sizes provide spaces for retreat and also serve as ideal productive hubs.Quiet spaces simultaneously reduce the overall noise level in the entire open- plan office, as the ‘loud’ to-dos of everyday working life are relocatedBy using the cabins as quiet spaces, the overall noise level in the entire open-plan office simultaneously reduces, as the ‘loud’ to-dos of everyday working life are relocated. Employees can retreat to the Focus cabin for lengthy phone calls, use the Meet cabin for intensive team meetings and drive a project forward with focus in the Work. This creates a calmer working environment overall. By the way, abolishing open-plan offices to promote productivity is not a viable alternative.Employees can choose their ideal retreat: the Focus cabin (top), Meet cabin (middle) or Work cabin (bottom)Productive in every wayA study by the Fraunhofer Institute found that, despite the noise pollution in open-plan spaces, employees generate more ideas, experience more variety, have more fun and have a greater sense of achievement. Open-plan offices also make it easier to establish and strengthen social contacts. However, the same study also reveals that a noisy environment reduces employee productivity by 40 per cent.The design professionals keep their focus on their own interior concepts‘We have made it our mission to support architects and planners in the design of spaces and thereby enable their clients to fully realise their creative potential,’ says Manuel Diekmann, founder of the company. This is why Berlin Acoustics not only creates spaces for peace and concentration but also allows design professionals to keep their focus on their own interior concepts through the minimalist design of the cabins.Thoughtful details, including ventilation systems, LED strips, power sockets, LAN ports and reinforced acoustics, seamlessly merge functionality with designFocus, meet, workUnder the motto ‘Quiet. Simple. Timeless.’ the new generation of phone and meeting cabins from Berlin Acoustics combines straightforward design with even more functionality and thoughtful sustainability. The entire production process, which all takes place in Germany, has been further optimised to reduce material waste to a minimum. Resource- saving materials are also used, for example in the carpets. It goes without saying that all three models are also designed with durability in mind.When entering the cabins, employees are put in the perfect lightIn addition, the cabins now have an optimised ventilation system that also creates a pleasant spatial atmosphere. LED strips that illuminate upon entry put employees in the perfect light. Power sockets and LAN ports are integrated as standard. The new aluminium profiling, combined with custom-developed tools, enables quick assembly and disassembly, making the cabins ideal for relocations or offices that are reconfigured on a project basis.The new version of the BA- Focus ensures maximum soundproofing with 40-millimetre reinforced acoustic felt and a double floor with carpeting. Occupying just one square metre of floor space, it demonstrates remarkable functionality and design. Thanks to the glass rear wall, the cabin can be placed in the centre of the room and serve as an eye-catching feature. As with all models, the rear wall can also be closed and made opaque. The BA-Focus can be assembled in under an hour. The Focus (top), Meet (middle), and Work (bottom) cabins from Berlin Acoustics strike the perfect balance: as large as needed, as small as possibleWith the goal of being as large as necessary, but as small as possible, the BA- Meet cabin has been reduced in size. As a compact solution with a user-centred design, it still accommodates up to four people. The table is height-adjustable, and benches, cushions and monitor holders are available as optional features. VSG safety glass with acoustic membrane offers optimal sound insulation, ensuring focused conversations inside that do not carry outside. BA- Work cabin has been completely redesigned as a mobile mini-office. Whether as an office within an office or as a workroom in a public space: BA-Work is synonymous with focused work.The cabins from Berlin Acoustics also prove their worth outside of open- plan offices with their acoustic performance of ISO Class B: as comfortable workspaces in co-working spaces and as retreats in public spaces. With fire protection certification, the cabins are even suitable for airports and train stations, giving business travellers the opportunity to make good use of their waiting time. Everywhere, the principle holds true: in silence lies strength, and this can be found in the models from Berlin Acoustics.Guest Feature by Mareile Morawietz / Architonic",
