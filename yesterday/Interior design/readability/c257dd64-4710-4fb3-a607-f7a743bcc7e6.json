  "text": "The Nissan Frontier TARMAC concept isn’t here to haul lumber or rocks. This one’s about making a statement. Designed by Nissan Motorsports (NISMO), Forsberg Racing, and Nissan Design America, this bold concept takes the classic work truck idea and supercharges it—literally and figuratively. Think of it as a track-ready muscle truck, complete with a 3.8-liter V6 that churns out a hefty 440 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. And if you’re already picturing burnouts, you’ll be glad to know that a custom handbrake was added just for that purpose. Designer: Chris Forsberg \u0026 Nissan This is no standard Frontier, not by a mile. The Frontier TARMAC’s heart is a supercharged engine with carbon fiber accents that reflect its performance-driven personality. The NISMO air intake and performance exhaust deliver power on demand, while custom NISMO brakes ensure it can actually stop when it needs to. This setup isn’t just about big numbers; it’s about delivering a refined level of control that’s engineered for precision on the track. The Frontier TARMAC’s Afterburn Orange paint—a new hue for the 2025 Frontier lineup—brings a bold aesthetic that turns heads. Carbon fiber fender flares add to the truck’s aggressive stance, giving it a sleek but dominant appearance. Those wide carbon fiber accents aren’t just for show either; they’re there to add strength and reduce weight. And then there are the wheels—custom 20-inch NISMO wheels wrapped in Yokohama Advan tires—adding yet another layer of performance and visual appeal. From top to bottom, the Frontier TARMAC looks ready to handle the asphalt with all the confidence of a sports car. If you’re wondering how they pulled off that low-riding look, the answer is in the suspension. This truck sits improbably low, thanks to a prototype NISMO coil-over setup in the front, with a rear flip kit and C-notch to make sure it stays close to the ground without compromising structural integrity. This custom suspension, paired with those beefy tires, gives the truck a “slammed” stance, as described by Chris Forsberg himself. Just one look tells you this vehicle isn’t meant for off-road adventuring—think racetrack, not mountain trails. Inside, the TARMAC concept doesn’t skimp on comfort or style. You’ll find Recaro seats that offer the perfect balance of support and sportiness, making every drive feel like a track day. The carbon fiber steering wheel and handbrake, both track-inspired, give drivers full control, emphasizing that this truck is built for those who value a more hands-on driving experience. Nissan clearly wasn’t aiming for “rugged” here—this is all about precision and speed. Even though the Nissan Frontier TARMAC is just a concept, it’s a fascinating nod to the muscle truck era, when power and performance were the only metrics that mattered. Nissan is showing off the TARMAC at SEMA this year, where it’s sharing the spotlight with other concepts like the “Project Trailgater” for tailgating fans, and the Kicks Beach Patrol for coastal explorers. Each concept represents a different aspect of Nissan’s vision for the future, but the Frontier TARMAC is easily one of the standouts. For anyone who’s ever wanted a pickup with muscle car roots, the Frontier TARMAC might be exactly the kind of “truck fantasy” they didn’t know they needed. It’s the answer to a question nobody asked: What if a work truck had a double life as a track star? In the end, the Nissan Frontier TARMAC might be one for the show floor, but it’s proof that Nissan isn’t afraid to play around with tradition and take its designs into bold new territory.",
