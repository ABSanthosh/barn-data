  "text": "DESIGN SHAPED BY TECHNOLOGY: THREE PROGRAMS FOR THE DIGITAL AGEThe professional field of design is rapidly evolving as ChatGPT, Midjourney and other emerging technologies have entered creative workflows. Crossing boundaries between disciplines, platforms, and industries, designers are increasingly required to work across hybrid environments – from physical products to immersive virtual experiences. In response, Istituto Marangoni Milano Design School introduces a trio of academic programs that embrace this shift, exploring the creative potential of artificial intelligence, robotics, and virtual environments. ‘Design disciplines are undergoing a profound transformation, where the boundaries between the physical and digital worlds are increasingly blurred,’ tells Sergio Nava, Director of Education at Istituto Marangoni Milano Design School, to designboom. ‘Companies are seeking professionals who can design experiences and products while navigating these two worlds with ease.’ With a future-focused approach, the school launches a new three-year bachelor’s course and two master’s programs that prepare students for the changing demands of the creative industries – fostering versatility, critical thinking, and cross-disciplinary collaboration.Istituto Marangoni Milano Design School introduces a trio of academic programs | all images courtesy of Istituto MarangoniFUTURE-FOCUSED LEARNING AT ISTITUTO MARANGONI MILANO Situated in the heart of one of the world’s leading design capitals, Istituto Marangoni’s Milano Design School embraces the city’s unique identity – rooted in tradition yet oriented toward experimentation. The school cultivates an environment where emerging technologies, digital tools, and cross-sector dialogue are essential parts of the curriculum. Tightly connected to Milan’s design districts and creative networks, the academic programs blend theory with hands-on practice, encouraging students to engage in real-world projects across a spectrum of disciplines.‘At Istituto Marangoni Milano Design, we believe that the true essence of education lies in what comes after,‘ explains Barbara Toscano, School Director, Istituto Marangoni Milano Design. ‘Our main goal is to shape the professionals of tomorrow, supporting them in building a solid, creative, and successful career path. This transition is not left to chance – it is an integral part of our daily teaching approach.’ the Milano Design School’s educational offerings include a three-year Bachelor’s degree and two Master’s programsINTRODUCING ACADEMIC PROGRAMS ON AI, ROBOTICS \u0026 VIRTUAL REALITY‘Through a dynamic academic offering, constantly updated and developed in collaboration with the most prestigious brands in the global design system, our students engage with the professional world from the very beginning of their journey. Our approach is proactive: we anticipate trends, study them in depth, and integrate them into our academic programs so that every talent can develop relevant and up-to-date skills,’  continues Toscano.The proactiveness of the Milano Design School has meant for 2025, educational offerings include a three-year Bachelor’s degree and two Master’s programs. Each course is tailored to the shifting needs of the design industry and the expanding role of technology in creative practice. See the school’s new programs below:The Bachelor in Design Innovation for Emerging Technologies is a three-year course that merges interior, product, and communication design with artificial intelligence, VR/AR, generative tools, robotics, and 3D printing. Students cultivate a strategic mindset through research, data analysis, and interdisciplinary projects. From foundational design principles in the first year to advanced AI and neuroscience applications in the final term, the course equips students to lead future design transformations. the bachelor’s and two master’s courses explore the evolving role of design in a tech-driven worldThe Product Design for Human-Robot Interaction Master’s course responds to the growing presence of intelligent machines in daily life and the design challenges they pose. Participants work on real-world projects with robotics companies, developing concepts that meet both functional requirements and emotional connection. They explore the principles of robotics and human-machine interaction, focusing on how design can build trust, enhance usability, and define the aesthetics of future robotic companions – from autonomous devices to AI-powered furnishings.Finally, the Master in Design for Gaming \u0026 Virtual Reality invites participants to create immersive brand experiences within the metaverse. From storytelling and avatar design to soundscapes and 3D environments, the course covers the full arc of virtual content development using the latest AR, MR, VR, and blockchain-based technologies. Students learn to gamify communication strategies, crafting digital narratives aligned with brand identity and user behavior, preparing them for careers at the intersection of gaming, design, and digital culture.‘The effectiveness of our vision is confirmed by the recent survey conducted by Doxa for the GGE Group, to which Istituto Marangoni belongs: 91% of our graduates find employment within one year of completing their studies. This result makes us proud and proves that with the right support, turning passion into a real career is not only possible – it’s reality.‘ concludes Barbara Toscano, School Director, Istituto Marangoni Milano Design, to designboom.students at Istituto Marangoni engage with the professional world from the very beginning of their journeythe school’s main goal is support their students in building a successful career pathprogram info: institute: Istituto Marangoni | @istitutomarangoni_milanodesignschool: Milan Design Schoollocation: Via Cerva, 24, 20122 Milan, Italy",
