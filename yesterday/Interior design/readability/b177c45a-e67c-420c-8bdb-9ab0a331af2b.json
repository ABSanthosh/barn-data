  "description": "Honda has announced they're launching Fastport, a B2B venture for delivering packages in urban markets. The company has designed this Fastport eQuad, a electric quadricycle, specifically to haul packages using bike lanes, avoiding both emissions and traffic. The eQuad runs on Honda's swappable Mobile Power Pack (MPP) batteries, reducing downtime. The UV-resistant canopy can be tinted for sunny cities, and a built-in fan helps keep the driver cool. The company says they've designed both large and small cargo boxes (we assume the images here show the large unit) that can be customized for different delivery needs. The large panels on the side will presumably be used for branding. Speaking of branding, I'm surprised by Honda's restraint; these days most manufacturers would have their name slathered all over the thing. The eQuad will make its debut later this month at the Eurobike show in Germany. The Fastport service is scheduled to launch in North America and Europe later this year.",
