  "text": "In an age where our thumbs scroll an average of 13.3 meters per day and our minds are bombarded with algorithm-driven content, digital fatigue is no longer a fringe concern, it’s a mainstream struggle. For one in five Koreans, smartphones are not just useful tools, but addictive ones. While smartphones offer countless conveniences, they also overwhelm us with stimuli, impairing self-regulation and contributing to broader social and cultural issues. That’s where MUTO steps in, offering a new kind of balance. MUTO is a little more nuanced than just being a “lockbox” for your phone, it’s a thoughtfully designed interactive device that enables users to maintain essential smartphone functions, like emergency calls and white noise playback while encouraging mindful disconnection. By combining intelligent design, customizable app integration, and tactile interaction, MUTO offers a more intuitive and accessible solution for smartphone detoxing. Designer: Seojin Lee Unlike existing detox devices that rely on harsh lockout methods or clunky, transparent aesthetics that reduce commitment, MUTO uses selective engagement. Through its companion app, users can define detox parameters such as duration, environment (work, sleep, relaxation), and whether to include a visual progress gauge. Once settings are saved, the phone is placed inside the device, and a transparent ring displays the detox progress, a calming visual cue that time is being spent purposefully. Detox doesn’t mean disconnection from everything. MUTO includes a tactile interaction pad and a smooth, rubber-ringed control interface that rests comfortably in the hand, like a minimalist mouse. This module sits above the speaker pad, letting users subtly interact with necessary functions: ASMR/White Noise Control: Create a peaceful atmosphere while you work or wind down. Detox Time Adjustment: Extend your detox without unlocking the phone, keeping you in the zone. Interaction Lock Feature: Engage in soothing tactile feedback – like rolling, tapping, or gripping, to reduce anxiety and maintain focus. MUTO acknowledges the critical role smartphones play in emergency contact. That’s why the system allows pre-set emergency thresholds. If the phone receives a certain number of urgent calls or messages, configured by the user, the detox mode temporarily lifts, the gauge turns red, and the phone gently rises from the device, signaling its availability. It’s important to see this not as a punishment tool, but rather, a guide toward healthier habits. By preserving core smartphone utilities and blending them with mindful, minimal interaction, MUTO promotes a more natural reduction in screen time without creating additional stress or friction. It’s as much about restoring control as it is about disconnecting. When detox time ends, your smartphone returns, fully charged through MUTO’s integrated wireless charging function. No cords, no clutter, no lost time. Whether you were sleeping, studying, or simply taking a break, MUTO held your place, letting you return to your digital life refreshed and focused.",
