  "description": "This federation home in Sydney’s lower North Shore has been adapted to accommodate a family of five — all at very different stages of life. Studio Prineas were tasked with creating a contemporary extension that would embrace the site’s sprawling gardens, without being visible from the street. The resulting Alpha House now balances colour-blocked spaces with classic features, and there’s enough room for the whole family inside.",

  "text": "Studio Prineas’ ethos is all about ‘thinking more and building less’. Especially when it comes to renovating heritage homes. This sensitive approach is exactly why the owners of this Federation residence approached the Sydney-based architects for a comprehensive renovation a few years ago. The family of five bought the house after outgrowing their previous home, located on the same tree-lined street in Artarmon. ‘The client sought a contemporary extension that would embrace the site’s sprawling gardens, while sitting quietly in the streetscape,’ Studio Prineas principal Eva-Marie Prineas says. ‘In addition, the family’s three children, ranging from primary school to university age, required the design to thoughtfully accommodate five people at very different life stages under the one roof.’ After restoring the front of the house and removing the series of ‘incongruous’ additions at the rear, Studio Prineas created a new light-filled extension designed deliberately around a towering Jacaranda tree in the backyard. By following the block’s natural slope and the steep pitch of the existing federation-era roof, the voluminous living spaces are neatly hidden behind the traditional facade — preserving the home’s heritage appeal. Even the soaring ceiling and the main bedroom wing on the upper level are completely undetectable from the street. ‘My favourite part of the project is the element of surprise as you move from the original home to the new addition,’ Eva-Marie says. ‘The landscape and interior become one space through considered openings and skylights, making it a light-filled and joyful place to live.’ The interiors also strike the right balance between classic and contemporary, anchored by sophisticated fireplaces, honed concrete flooring, and colour-blocked spaces inspired by soft ‘botanical’ hues. In the kitchen, the striking blush and burgundy veined marble is framed like a jewel against a warm backdrop of tallowwood veneer cabinetry. Meanwhile, the original garage was converted into a playful teenager’s retreat, complete with a kitchenette and bathroom next to the terracotta-coloured poolside refuge. The owners say Alpha House now feels warm and inviting — somewhere they will ‘thrive’ as their family moves through life’s milestones together.",
