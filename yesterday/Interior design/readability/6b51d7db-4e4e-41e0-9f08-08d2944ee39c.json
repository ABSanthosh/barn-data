  "text": "Joon shoe by Clément De Cooman can be taken apartThe Joon shoe, designed by Clément De Cooman, introduces a modular assembly system centered on elastic connections, enabling easy separation between the sole and upper part. The design embraces functionality and simplicity, showcasing clean lines and a modern aesthetic while prioritizing recyclability and ease of disassembly.In 2022, of the 24 billion pairs of shoes produced, 22 billion were discarded—representing 90% of annual production—with only 12% recycled. The bulk of discarded shoes are burned or buried, largely due to the challenges in recycling complex materials bound by glue and stitching. Traditional shoe assembly methods make it difficult to separate mixed materials, which are often incompatible in durability and recyclability. On average, 42% of materials are wasted from production to finished shoe, with limited design for end-of-life recycling.all images courtesy of Clément De CoomanJoon’s Modular Design allows for easy Recycling, Reducing WasteDesigner Clément De Cooman’s concept for Joon shoes addresses this through an innovative elastic-based assembly. The shoe’s sole features notches along its edge, which connect to corresponding perforations in the upper part of the shoe. Assembly is completed by threading the elastic along these curves, securing the upper to the sole. The elastic, which is hollow, grips the sole notches to keep the parts together. Both the sole and elastic are made out of TPU 95A, a thermoplastic that allows for easy remelting and recycling. The upper, primarily crafted from leather, includes minimal additional materials—such as a small amount of stretch fabric, which is removable as it’s lightly stitched in place. This design not only makes the shoe easily separable but also returns customization control to the consumer, enabling simplified inventory management and extending product life through modularity.Joon shoe by Clément De Cooman redefines footwear with a modular design for easy disassemblyelastic-based connections allow the Joon shoe’s sole and upper to be separated seamlesslyJoon’s minimalist design highlights clean lines, prioritizing both functionality and sustainabilityJoon shoe tackles recycling barriers with an innovative, glue-free assembly system",
