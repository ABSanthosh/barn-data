  "text": "Tucked away in the pulse of the city, the Soft Form Studio, a project by Ans Render, offers a different kind of rhythm. One that is quiet, tactile, and deeply intentional. This urban retreat redefines minimalism by leaning into softness. It layers neutral tones, sculptural lighting, and cozy textures to create a home that feels both elevated and inviting. Every detail, from the woolly wall art to the curved form, is designed to slow you down and draw you in. A cream-themed foyer with an organically shaped mirror invites you into the Soft Form Studio. You will be led into the living space, first catching a glance of a decorated bookshelf. Here, an open floor plan, with a living room and kitchen area, keeps the ambiance airy. A cozy gray sectional anchors the living area, while the kitchen features a marble island, warm wooden cabinetry, and tiled backsplash. Despite being a compact apartment, the Soft Form Studio makes room for the homeowners’ priorities, one of which was working from home. This home office houses a gray two-seater sofa, adding modern design and functionality. A sculptural table provides room to hold magazines or other essentials, while a plush rug softens the area underfoot. On the other end, a sleek wall-mounted desk curves at one end, adding elegance. Natural light floods the space, making sure it’s illuminated throughout the day. The dining nook features a pedestal table, which makes for a space-savvy pick. This is paired with minimalist chairs and a globe-like chandelier. A special mention for the textured artwork, which instantly forms the focal point of the space. It is further accentuated by accent lighting. The bedroom in the Soft Form Studio features a soft upholstered bed. This is flanked by two different types of nightstands, adding a beautiful sense of asymmetry. The pendant lights hanging on either end add visual intrigue to the bedroom when the sun goes down. The bathroom is as luxurious as it gets! We see marble features adding a bold punch. A freestanding sink is paired with recessed shelving and a strategically lit mirror, making sure the space is as functional as is stylish",
