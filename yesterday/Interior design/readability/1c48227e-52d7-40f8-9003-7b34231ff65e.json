Founded by Rudy Weissenberg and Rodman Primack, AGO Projects showcases new work by Kueng Caputo, comprised of Sarah Kueng and Lovis Caputo, in a display dubbed Hallo, Sunshine. On the opening day, AGO Projects also celebrates the launch of their first book, Love How You Live: Adventures in Interior Design, with a signing event featuring both Weissenberg and Primack. Limited copies of the volume are available throughout the exhibition, which coincides with Art Basel Paris and Design Miami.Paris 2024. all images © Thierry DépanneAGO Projects invites Kueng Caputo to unveil terracotta piecesThe Hallo, Sunshine exhibition continues the long-standing relationship between the Mexico City-based gallery AGO Projects and Zurich-based design duo Kueng Caputo. The gallery’s founders, Rudy Weissenberg and Rodman Primack, have known Sarah Kueng and Lovis Caputo since their time as industrial design students at HGKZ Zurich. Kueng Caputo’s work is rooted in material exploration, often rethinking traditional craft techniques and applications. At India Mahdavi’s Paris Project Room, a prominent space for international design, the duo is presenting lighting and tables that reflect their experimentation with industrial brick as a medium for creating unique design objects and furniture.For this collection, Kueng Caputo have utilized Swissmodul, standard terracotta bricks from Switzerland, transforming them with smooth, colored glazes. Each piece, handcrafted in their studio through a careful, time-intensive process, is distinct. The collection brings together color, texture, form, and light, resulting in collectible objects that are both functional and visually engaging.AGO Projects showcases new work by Kueng Caputointroducing Love How You Live: Adventures in Interior DesignAGO Projects’ debut book, Love How You Live: Adventures in Interior Design, showcases the vibrant, personal, and art-filled homes for which the gallery is known. Renowned AD100 designer Rodman Primack, along with his partner Rudy Weissenberg, has spent over two decades creating joyful, eclectic spaces that break conventional design hierarchies. Their projects layer textures, patterns, art, and bold colors, embodying a philosophy that spontaneity, juxtaposition, and emotional resonance lead to satisfying environments. Primack also emphasizes that high design doesn’t have to be expensive, making it accessible and relatable.The book offers readers a tour of 13 residences around the world, including the personal homes of Primack and Weissenberg. Each space reflects the unique culture and conditions of its location, from Mexico City, Guatemala, and London to New York, California, Kentucky, Hawaii, Cape Cod, and Miami. Rooted in the belief that beauty lies in authenticity and a sense of place, Love How You Live explores how design can be both deeply personal and globally inspired.the Hallo, Sunshine exhibition continues the long-standing relationship AGO Projects and Kueng CaputoKueng Caputo’s work is rooted in material explorationrethinking traditional craft techniques and applications",
