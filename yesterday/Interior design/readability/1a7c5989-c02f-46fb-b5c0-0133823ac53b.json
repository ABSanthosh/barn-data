  "text": "From silicone, metal and leather to transparent, opaque, wireless charging, or shimmering ones; there are endless types of smartphone cases out there. When everything else has found its way onto the smartphone cases, it’s time a retro marble machine is slapped onto the back of your phone so you can take breaks between social media scrolls and stay entertained even on the flip side of the phone. Now that is a case that’ll be a conversation starter, anytime anywhere. The interesting smartphone case, which appears to have been created for iPhone 16 Pro, is meticulously designed and developed by @karakurist, a Japanese YouTuber (channel name: KARAKURI Channel) known for creating mechanical art from scratch. All his creations are unique and this one is right up there, since you’ll be using the thing for most of the day. Designer: KARAKURI Channel A marble machine slotted onto the guts of a smartphone case for the iPhone may sound and appear simple, but frankly, after watching the detailed DIY video, I can say, it is no mean feat. This amazing smartphone case with a marble machine is completely 3D printed all the miniature gears and 32 different detail parts are made using the printer. Everything snaps into place with the help of tiny screws and the friction of the gears against each other. What appears to the eyes is a transparent maze with tiny 4mm ball bearings rolling around with the help of complex gears and a built-in motor. Users can play the game as long as the motor is running, which is interestingly powered by the phone’s own USB-C port Perhaps then no external device or charging is supported in the process when you are enjoying the marble roll. There is a safety mechanism in place so that it spins freely in case the gear gets stuck when the spring stretches. The marble machine is a thoughtful attachment for the 3D printed case, which has a hollowed-out section in the middle and top right, where the attachment snaps in or out in one go. The designer is mindful enough to have a separate slot to store a small charging cable, so you don’t have to look around for one. The detachable aspect means you don’t permanently have to have the marbles rolling in the back of your phone; you can choose when to shift entertainment from the screen to the flip side!",
