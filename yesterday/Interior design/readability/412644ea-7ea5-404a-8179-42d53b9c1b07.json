  "text": "YUJI OKITSU’s tree illuminates tadao ando’s Omotesando HillsThis festive season, Japanese architect Yuji Okitsu illuminates Omotesando Hills, Tokyo, with a dazzling installation, the Christmas Tree of Light. Standing 8.4 meters tall, the spiral-shaped centerpiece is crafted from 40,000 precision-cut Fresnel lenses. Installed within the expansive atrium of the commercial complex designed by Tadao Ando, the luminous design integrates architecture, light, and holiday cheer.The spiral form of the tree is inspired by the iconic ramp of the building, a defining feature of Ando’s architecture, which spirals around the atrium. Layered ribbons of 5.5 cm lenses, each just 0.3 mm thick, create an ever-changing interplay of light and reflection. As visitors walk along the spiraling path, the shimmering surface of the tree evolves, embodying the dynamic energy of the district.all images by Satoshi Nagare, courtesy of Yuji Okitsukaleidoscopic ornaments complete the christmas installationDesigned for the Omotesando Hills Christmas 2024 event, the Christmas Tree of Light reflects the vibrant cultural exchanges and diversity of Omotesando. Beyond the central installation by Tokyo-based designer Yuji Okitsu, the design extends to the atrium with kaleidoscopic ornaments. These polygonal structures, made of thin, crystal-patterned lenses, hover gracefully above the tree and the grand staircase. With a diameter of up to 90 centimeters, the ornaments refract and multiply reflections of the tree, holiday decorations, and visitors’ movements. The result is a kaleidoscope-like spectacle that immerses guests in a multidimensional experience.The interplay between the lenses and light animates the tree and captures the essence of Omotesando’s cultural history. As the ornaments reflect the bustling scene of the building and its surroundings, the installation invites visitors to explore the space and discover its transformative views. By day or night, the Christmas Tree of Light offers a one-of-a-kind holiday spectacle.the Christmas tree set up in the distinctive atrium and grand staircase designed by Tadao AndoChristmas Tree of Light takes advantage of the open atrium space at Omotesando Hillsthe tree and ornaments, all made of lenses, create a light installation",
