  "text": "For 55 years, Range Rover has set the standard for luxury SUVs, with outstanding off-road capability and cutting-edge technological advancements. The iconic brand launched its first installation in Milan, Futurespective: Connected World, designed in collaboration with design studio NUOVA. Two seemingly opposite worlds collide – a 1970s showroom, complete with wood paneling, shag carpet, and a khaki Range Rover, leads into a hypermodern white space, with the 2025 Range Rover at the center of the installation. Here, these worlds work in harmony – bridging the gap between 1970 and 2025, the “futurespective” sets the scene for the next generation of Range Rovers, the distinct quality of immersion taking us simultaneously to the past and future. Stepping into a walnut-paneled ’70s paradise, full-length mirrors, distinctive clocks and hardware make this truly an immersive experience. So different from the open air and clever anchoring of the car in space, the 1970 Classic Range Rover is outfitted in a signature Olive Green color, warm and solid, reflecting similar color palettes of the time. Here, a deep burgundy shag offsets the green of the Rover and the dappled brown hues of the walnut, a bold and distinctly groovy interior that includes heartwarming details – a brochure that looks like it’s 50 years old, decade-specific lighting on the ceiling and side tables – that offers a distinct respect to the time, while also contrasting so elegantly with its new cousin. To outfit the space, NUOVA designed custom furniture, like the oxblood red seating, a circular version of their Enzo table with a white Carrara marble top, and bespoke desk chairs. 1970s details round out the room, including 44 custom beam ceiling lights, a chrome table lamp, a fish tank, and original sketches. NUOVA also collaborated with LA-based luxury atelier L’Equip to design outfits for the “time travel” concierge who guided guests through the two capsules in gear inspired by 1970s work attire and British fashion. “Range Rover has long been a companion to generations, seamlessly evolving through time while remaining anchored in its unmistakable identity. Our exploration of time travel isn’t merely nostalgic or speculative – it’s a lens through which we examine how design, innovation, and craftsmanship weave together across eras. Partnering with a brand so deeply rooted in heritage, yet constantly driven by evolution and reinvention, feels like a natural alignment,” says NUOVA founders Enrico Pietra and Rodrigo Caula. Leaving 1970 behind, the carpet is a first signifier of our immersion in the here and now, a wall-to-wall swan gray that speaks to space travel, aviation, and the great beyond. Mirrors stand in as columns, surrounding the 2025 Range Rover in a Bespoke metallic green finish. As the viewer traverses around the car, the mirrors pick up flitting images, coming in and out of focus thanks to strategic angling. Highlighting different facets of the car, the mirrors also showcase the soft gray of the walls with a bright light coming from the ceiling, almost mimicking a huge sunroof on a slightly overcast day illuminating the silhouette of the car. Launched in the 1970s in the United Kingdom and Australia, the Range Rover has been an iconic part of American culture as well, gray market sales prompting the brand to expand to the United States officially in 1987. The fifth-generation 2025 Range Rover has all the rugged capability of it’s original counterpart, with top of the line handling and sleek accents more appropriate for a modern age. NUOVA, an acronym for New Understanding of Various Artifacts, is a luxury design venture using research and innovation-based methods to tailor the future with time travel. Working within the industrial and interior design, creative direction, advanced material innovation, sustainability strategy, packaging and product development industries, they help companies develop immersive 360-degree spatial brand experiences.
