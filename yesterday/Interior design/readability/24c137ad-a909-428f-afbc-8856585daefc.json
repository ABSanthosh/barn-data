From muted minimalism to unusual colour blocking, the projects listed below highlight the scope of global interiors trends from the last 12 months. In particular, designers were seen to delve into the eclectic histories of the homes they worked on to inform contemporary renovations. Read on for Dezeen's top 10 home interiors of 2024: Photo by Justin ChungDuane House, USA, by OWIU Readers praised the \"beautifully executed\" interior of Duane House, a mid-century renovation in Los Angeles with traditional Japanese influences. The principals of local studio OWIU completed the project as a self-designed home. It features original red brick flooring, sliding shoji screens and delicate Akari lamps by iconic Japanese-American designer Isamu Noguchi.

Called Lovers Walk, the dwelling features a bold collection of colour and texture – from a \"sensual\" red quartzite kitchen to a swirly green oak-lined hallway.

The unusual floor plan features three jagged walls delineating colourful and angular spaces within the single-storey home. \"Transforming a story into architecture seemed to us a fascinating and fun challenge,\" H3O told Dezeen.

The Porto studio added its trademark oversized spots and stripes to this Lisbon home, which features custom cabinetry and pinewood flooring dotted with geometric walnut accents. \"We tried to diversify the material palette as much as possible while still making it quite banal,\" explained Fala Atelier partner Filipe Magalhães. \"The choices are very Portuguese, but the mixture aims at being more than just that,\" added the architect.

Designed as an homage to the nearby sea, the interior was transformed from a dark and heavily partitioned space into a modern and functional home with exposed beams, sandy-coloured flooring and delicate fluted accents.

Interiors firm DAB Studio chose an Ettore Sottsass gridded feature wall and a sculptural green ladder for the Amsterdam home, which includes an eclectic selection of vintage and contemporary furniture. \"The interior has a free, creative spirit in which each element can stand on its own and be seen as art,\" studio co-founder Lotte Bruns told Dezeen.

Sebban and his team chose glossy walls, ruched curtains and poured-in-place resin flooring for the 1970s-style apartment, which was created as \"a manifesto of [the Uchronia] universe\", explained the founder. Known for its application of vibrant colours and undulating shapes, the studio took home the title of emerging interior designer of the year at the 2023 Dezeen Awards and has since continued to create interiors in its distinctive style.

The home's interior layout aims to capture the charm of typical Keralan bungalows known as nālukettu, which were designed with four halls or buildings surrounding a central courtyard. A mixture of teak, rattan and antique chandeliers brings a subtle luxury to the home.

French studio Toledano + Architects renovated the dwelling with a wavy timber mezzanine to optimise the compact 70-square-metre footprint. \"The waves and the sinuous coast set the tone for the project, entirely drawn in curves,\" said architect Gabrielle Toledano.
