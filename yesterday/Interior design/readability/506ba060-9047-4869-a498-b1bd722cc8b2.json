  "description": "Between St Andrews Golf Course and Beach lies a small cluster of houses lucky to call this special part of the world home. Kollab directors Hayley and Mick Barrett and their three children lived here for 15 years, before demolishing their previous home and building their dream home on the same site, designed by Pleysier Perkins.
