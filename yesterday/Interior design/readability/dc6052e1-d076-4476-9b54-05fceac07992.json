The iPhone SE 4, or what might be called the iPhone 16e, seems ready to shake things up in early 2025. Rumors of a March launch are floating around the interwebs, although there’s no official date in mind (given that Apple hasn’t made any announcements for upcoming keynotes yet). That being said, the iPhone SE 4 is long overdue, given that its predecessor launched in 2022. A tipster on X shared images of a dummy phone given to case-makers and accessory manufacturers. Touted to be the upcoming iPhone SE 4, the phone gives us a pretty concise idea of what we can expect with Apple’s latest budget-friendly iPhone. Gone are the thick bezels and that physical home button. Instead, you get a 6.1-inch edge-to-edge display that takes cues from the iPhone 14. The shift feels long overdue, but it’s a welcome change. Apple has clearly decided that even its “budget” options shouldn’t look outdated. Whether the device will stick with a notch or adopt the Dynamic Island remains a mystery, but the overall design promises to feel more current than before. Image via X (@SonnyDickson) From the rumors circling the internet, it’s not just the look that’s leveling up. The screen technology is taking a leap forward too. Moving from an LCD to OLED is a serious win for anyone upgrading from an older SE. Expect richer colors, better contrast, and improved efficiency. It’s the kind of difference you notice right away—deeper blacks and visuals that just feel more polished. For a phone in this price range, that’s not something you’d usually expect. And then there’s the long-overdue shift to USB-C. If you’ve been juggling different cables for different devices, this change simplifies things. Even though the port may only support USB 2.0 speeds, the move feels like a step in the right direction. Other visual changes on the phone’s frame include the lack of an action button (we’re back to the old mute switch days), and clearly no Camera Control ‘button’ like Apple announced with the 16 series. The SE 3 didn’t have MagSafe so one could argue the SE 4 might miss it too, although wireless capabilities and MagSafe are really becoming a dominant feature in phones of this supposed price range. Image via X (@SonnyDickson) Speaking of upgrades, the camera is getting a major refresh. A 48MP sensor allegedly replaces the old 12MP one, bringing a noticeable bump in photo quality. Whether it’s snapping shots at night or recording 4K video, the iPhone SE 4 will give you more to work with. Apple hasn’t confirmed much about zoom capabilities, but the upgrade alone should satisfy both casual users and anyone who takes their mobile photography seriously. Don’t expect dual-lens camera setups on the SE anytime soon – but even with one lens, the iPhone SE 4 should definitely get the job done. Under the hood, the SE 4 is rumored to feature Apple’s A18 chip paired with 8GB of RAM. What does that mean for the user? Faster performance, smoother multitasking, and the kind of speed that keeps your phone future-proof for a while. Apple’s massive push towards Apple Intelligence probably means this phone will come with the highly awaited AI assistant. That’s sort of why Apple decided to give the SE 4 the same chip as the iPhone 16 series. More on this when the phone officially launches. Curiously, Apple might be rethinking how it positions this phone. The potential rebranding as the iPhone 16e hints at a shift in strategy. Instead of standing out as the “cheap iPhone,” it could become a core part of the lineup—offering flagship features with just a few compromises. That name change, subtle as it seems, could reshape how people perceive the device. Price-wise, the SE 4 is expected to start at $499. Sure, it’s a bump up from its predecessor, but considering the OLED display, the camera upgrades, and the more powerful chip, it feels justified. You’re getting more for your money, and that’s the bottom line. Regional pricing might vary, but overall, it’s still positioned to attract users who want Apple’s ecosystem without the premium price tag.",
