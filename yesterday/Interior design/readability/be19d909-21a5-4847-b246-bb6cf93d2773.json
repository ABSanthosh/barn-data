  "text": "The owners of Annandale House had seen it featured on Vogue Living years before the architecturally designed home even hit the market. So when the property first came up for sale in 2021, the opportunity to make it their home was ‘too compelling to resist’. Once a modest weatherboard cottage, the home at 203 Nelson Street, Annandale, is pretty unique to say the least. A transformative renovation by Welsh + Major maximises space behind the heritage-protected facade — which stands at just five metres wide. The architects created a breezy extension crafted from a series of masonry volumes, making the most of the narrow block with an additional ground-floor level and an impressive lightwell separating old and new. This space holds the staircase, wrapped around a majestic fig-leaf tree, alongside a retractable glazed roof overhead that opens the whole lightwell to the sky at the flick of a switch! The owners fell in love with this impressive spin on indoor-outdoor living, and the home’s impeccable craftsmanship. ‘While we didn’t oversee the build or initiate major renovations ourselves, we have carefully curated the interiors to enhance the original design ethos, ensuring the home retains its unique character,’ they say. In contrast to the two original bedrooms, the living room, dining room and kitchen feature a contemporary mix of polished concrete floors, exposed sandstone, and dark timber joinery. There’s also a luxurious main bedroom overlooking the serene courtyard terrace, while a rooftop garden lined with seasonal-blooming aloes is another highlight of the innovative design. After living in this retreat filled with ‘moments of calm’ for the past few years, the couple have decided to list the three-bedroom house to move closer to their extended family. ‘We will miss the quiet elegance of this home,’ the owners add. Leaving the area is bittersweet too, calling Annadale one of Sydney’s ‘hidden gems’. ‘It’s been wonderful to enjoy the best of both worlds: the energy of the CBD just moments away and the warmth and community spirit that make Annandale truly special,’ the vendors say. ‘Living here has allowed us to appreciate not only the architectural nuances of our home but also the unique character of this exceptional neighbourhood.’ 203 Nelson Street, Annandale, NSW 2038, is listed for sale with Chris Nunn from BresicWhitney and will go to auction on 3:45pm Saturday November 30.",
