  "text": "AXOR and Antonio Citterio on how to escape the ordinaryWhat if, instead of stepping into a bathroom, a sensorial, curated space of luxurious and personalized water experience awaited behind the door? This is the question AXOR poses with its 2025 campaign, Escape the Ordinary. Not content with faucets and fixtures alone, the company sets out to redefine what it means to wash, to soak, to shower. Partnering with Antonio Citterio, the Italian designer known as the Gentleman of Design, AXOR presents three bathroom concepts that are not merely places of function, but destinations in themselves — sanctuaries of style, context, and personal expression. ‘Each concept is deeply inspired by the idea of a journey — both physical and sensory. We envisioned journeys through Japan, South Africa and Italy, with each place offering a unique perspective on design, culture and the relationship with water,‘ says Citterio.situated near Cape Town, South Africa, Citterio’s second bathroom concept emphasizes the region’s simple elegance and raw, natural beauty | all images courtesy of AXORThe Call of New Concepts: Western Cape Leads the WaySince its inception in 1993, AXOR has existed in a category of its own — a design brand committed not just to the technical excellence of bathroom fixtures but to crafting experiences that honor both water and the people who engage with it. Known for its high-end, customizable collections, the German brand collaborates with some of the most forward-thinking designers in the world, including Jean-Marie Massaud, Barber Osgerby, and Philippe Starck. In its 2025 collaboration with Antonio Citterio, AXOR unveils a trilogy of immersive bathroom concepts under the banner Escape the Ordinary. Three spaces inspired by the spirit of travel — rooted in Japan, Italy, and South Africa — each serves as a canvas for the company’s latest innovations, particularly the AXOR ShowerSphere and the AXOR Citterio C collection, with the Western Cape Apartment Residence standing out as a perfect distillation of these ideas.Of the three bathroom concepts Antonio Citterio envisioned for AXOR, the Western Cape Apartment Residence resonates with a particularly tactile, elemental energy. Set against the dramatic natural backdrop of Cape Town, South Africa, this bathroom concept channels the raw beauty of the region’s rocky landscapes and earthy tones. Materials are not chosen solely for their visual appeal but for their ability to carry stories — red local clay walls crafted with water-repellent plaster echo the arid, sunbaked land. The flooring, made of reclaimed Palladian Terrazzo, connects the space to a heritage of resourcefulness and craftsmanship, while the deep red mosaic tiling in the shower offers a rich, textured counterpoint. Citterio’s concept is about creating a sense of belonging, even in solitude — a space that feels rooted in place yet utterly personal.each material was chosen not only for its aesthetics but for its ability to tell a story, referencing the rocky surroundings of Cape Townthe Sculptural, Sustainable, and Sensual AXOR ShowerSphereAt the heart of the Western Cape Apartment Residence lies AXOR’s latest innovation: the AXOR ShowerSphere. It isn’t just a showerhead; it’s a sculptural object, a bold elliptical form with slanted edges that seems to hover effortlessly overhead. This monolithic shape, paired with a minimalist soft-square escutcheon and a refined shower arm, turns a functional object into a focal point. But beyond its form, the AXOR ShowerSphere is a masterclass in water efficiency and comfort. Operating at a mere 8 liters per minute — thanks to AXOR’s EcoSmart technology — it demonstrates that sustainability and luxury can co-exist. With Flexpower elastic nozzles that adapt to varying water flows and pressures, the AXOR ShowerSphere ensures a consistently indulgent shower experience. Two spray modes — a soft, immersive PowderRain and a classic Rain setting — transform daily routines into rituals of well-being.This is more than clever engineering. It’s about how water is delivered, how it feels on skin, how it resonates with mood. In a drought-sensitive region like South Africa, such technology matters. Here, Citterio turns necessity into an artform, proving that design isn’t about excess — it’s about precision and sensitivity.at the heart of the Western Cape Apartment Residence lies the AXOR ShowerSphereTo complement the sculptural, sustainable, and sensual AXOR ShowerSphere, Citterio selected a suite of AXOR fixtures, each contributing its own layer of tactility and function. The AXOR Citterio C porter unit, an elegantly discreet wall-mounted hand shower holder, pairs with the thermostatic modules from the AXOR One collection — minimalistic in form, intuitive in use. The AXOR Drain disappears seamlessly into the terrazzo floor, a practical detail turned beautiful through thoughtful integration. All elements are finished in Brushed Black Chrome, part of AXOR’s FinishPlus PVD range, creating a sumptuous contrast against the terracotta-red walls and adding a sense of contemporary sophistication to the earthy color palette.At the washbasin, a rectangular AXOR Suite bowl sits atop a clay-plaster cabinet, evoking simplicity and handmade authenticity. It’s paired with either a single-lever AXOR Citterio E mixer or — in a secondary variation — a 3-hole AXOR Citterio E mixer, each distinguished by its signature cross handles and timeless proportions. These carefully chosen elements mirror the concept’s balance of rustic texture and modern refinement.",
