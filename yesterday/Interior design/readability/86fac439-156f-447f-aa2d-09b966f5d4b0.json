  "text": "Alloy Development, an architecture studio and developer based in New York, has unveiled plans for One Third Avenue – a 63-story skyscraper that will adhere to Passive House standards. Set to become the second tallest building in Brooklyn, this impressive structure will soar to 220 meters (725 feet). The skyscraper will house 583 apartments on floors 11 through 60, with 152 units designated as affordable housing. The building’s lower levels will also feature six floors dedicated to office space. The design features a cubic tower distinguished by its gridded facade. At its base, a darkly clad podium is present, hosting a street-level restaurant and a terrace above. One Third Avenue will stand alongside the adjacent 505 State Street tower, forming part of the larger Alloy Block in Downtown Brooklyn. This mixed-use development is poised to become the borough’s “most sustainable block,” including two new branches of New York public schools. Designer: Alloy Development “Alloy Development today announced the second phase of the Alloy Block in Downtown Brooklyn and the tallest Passive House building in the world, One Third Avenue,” said Alloy. Alloy CEO Jared Della Vale says since the One Third Avenue will be built to Passive House standards, this could be quite “incredibly challenging”. “One Third Ave will raise the bar for sustainable urban development,” said Valle. “Developing a Passive House building at this scale will be incredibly challenging, but the payoff will be significant with high-quality living that remains environmentally friendly and energy efficient. The second phase of the Alloy Block will demonstrate new possibilities to the industry and stand as an example of a solution that helps stall climate change.” The building is designed to incorporate large operable windows, along with an “airtight, well-insulated building envelope,” and will offer filtered fresh air, critical features in meeting Passive House standards. These elements are designed to optimize energy efficiency and sustainability, significantly enhancing indoor air quality. Both the residential and office spaces within the skyscraper will “share energy resources,” a strategy implemented by Alloy to reduce waste heat and improve overall resource efficiency. An interior rendering reveals a living room with modern concrete ceilings and substantial square windows, emphasizing the building’s sleek and contemporary design. Once completed, One Third Avenue will stand as the second tallest skyscraper in Brooklyn, surpassed only by the 325-meter-tall Brooklyn Tower designed by SHoP Architects. This impressive structure will redefine the borough’s skyline while contributing to its commitment to sustainability and energy efficiency. Construction will commence in the summer of 2025, and the skyscraper is expected to be completed in 2028. This will also mark the completion of the large Alloy Block since the other buildings on the site are open. The block includes two historic buildings that have been transformed into retail spaces and two schools accommodated in a building by the local studio Architecture Research Office.",
