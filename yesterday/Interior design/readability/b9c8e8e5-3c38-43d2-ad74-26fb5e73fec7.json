  "text": "Thanks for stopping by for this week’s Style Scouting. My Sunday post where I share the random stuff that captured my attention or inspired me that I found online. Ed and I just got back from a lovely week staying at Sea Pines Plantation in Hilton Head, South Carolina. It was a nice escape even with a few days of torrential rain. Plus a change of scenery is always a good way to press pause and collect yourself. Riding bikes on the beach is one of our favorite pastimes as well as riding along the many shaded bike paths that Hilton Head has. In May the weather is warm, but not overly hot and humid yet, and the crowds have not yet arrived which made for a perfect, relaxing getaway. As much as I loved our week away, it always feels so nice to be greeted by your own home sweet home after a vacation. :-) Now onto the links I found this week.
