  "text": "French designer Louis Le Joly Senoville has introduced Ha Mat, a wearable chess set that turns a centuries-old game into a playful, portable accessory. Born from his passion for chess and a desire to play anytime, anywhere, the design combines functionality and style, challenging traditional notions of both games and fashion. Designer: Louis Le Joly Senoville The Ha Mat set consists of three key elements: Rings: 32 bold metal rings represent the chess pieces. Each piece is crafted from rectangular brass blocks, laser-cut to feature graphic reliefs that symbolize their identity. A cross for the king, a zigzag for the queen’s crown, and a simplified horse head for the knight exemplify the blend of utility and artistry. Silk Scarf: The silk scarf serves as the chessboard, seamlessly blending form and function. Its design incorporates patterns derived from the ring pieces, creating an elegant accessory that can be worn daily. To complement the unconventional forms of the chess pieces, the scarf features a printed layout of their arrangement, making it intuitive for players to recognize and use the pieces during a game. Custom Watch: A sleek aluminum and leather wristwatch serves as a dual chess timer when separated, enhancing its multifunctional appeal. Le Joly Senoville’s design draws from history, referencing concealed wearable objects like silk escape maps from WWII and 19th-century military scarves. This historical context blends with modern aesthetics to create a set steeped in tradition yet tailored for contemporary use. The pieces were precision-cut from brass and galvanized with silver, produced in collaboration with a French waterjet metal cutting company. The scarf was crafted from deadstock silk sourced from LVMH Group, emphasizing sustainability. Even the watch prototype was handmade with the help of watchmakers, demonstrating meticulous attention to detail. The designer’s decision to manufacture entirely in France challenges the mass-production norms of design industries, aligning with his commitment to local craftsmanship and sustainable practices. While Ha Mat’s concept may not cater to daily wear, its ingenuity and charm are undeniable. The wearable rings are visually striking, balancing functionality and artistic expression. The project was conceived as Le Joly Senoville’s final-year project at Central Saint Martins, reflecting his appreciation for chess as a “timeless and intergenerational” game. The name Ha Mat pays homage to the Breton phrase “eched ha mat” (checkmate), a nod to the designer’s heritage in Brittany. It underscores the designer’s effort to modernize the game while honoring its rich history. Le Joly Senoville joins a growing movement of designers reimagining chess, such as Stefan Gougherty’s Negative Space Chess Set and Florian Hauswirth’s stackable Democratic Chess Set. However, Ha Mat stands out for its wearable, multifunctional approach, blending the worlds of design, fashion, and gameplay in an innovative and striking way. This unique set invites players to rethink the boundaries of the game, offering a creative and stylish way to engage with chess in any setting.",
