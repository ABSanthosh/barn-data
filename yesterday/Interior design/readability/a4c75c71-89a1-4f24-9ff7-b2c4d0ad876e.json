  "text": "Backcountry Containers recently designed the versatile and unique Augustine tiny home. Built using a metal box, the compact dwelling is great for rural living or as a hunting lodge. It is equipped with a flexible bedroom and a garage space that can be utilized to accommodate people or vehicles quite comfortably. It is based on a 4o-feet shipping container painted in a uniform dark gray or “Iron Ore”. It features insulation, windows, as well as a front door, modifying the box. The interiors showcase a finishing in pine wools, paired with vinyl flooring and a shiplap ceiling. Designer: Backcountry Containers The layout of the space is ingeniously compact, designed with an emphasis on flexibility to accommodate various living needs. As you enter through the front door, you’re greeted by an open living area that serves as the heart of the home. This versatile space is furnished with a large, comfortable sofa that invites relaxation and socializing. Adjacent to the sofa is a dining area equipped with a table and chairs designed to seat two, providing a cozy spot for meals. The living area is truly quite adaptable. If you need additional sleeping arrangements, this space can be converted into a bedroom. You can install a sofa bed, for a seamless day-to-night transition or choose bunk beds to maximize sleeping capacity without sacrificing floor space. Located closely is the kitchen which maintains a minimal aesthetic. It features a small refrigerator, perfect for storing perishables, alongside a functional sink and ample cabinetry to keep kitchen essentials organized and within easy reach. It is also equipped with a coffee machine and more than enough space for other appliances. Located in another part of the tiny house is the bathroom, which is compact yet functional. The bathroom is quite snug, but it efficiently accommodates all the necessary amenities. It features a standard flushing toilet, and adjacent to the toilet is a sink. Completing the setup is a shower, designed to maximize the limited space. On the opposite side of the container from the living room, you’ll find the versatile garage space. Depending on your needs, the garage can be transformed into a master bedroom, providing a more spacious and private sleeping area. It can also be configured to include multiple bunk beds, making it an ideal solution for accommodating additional guests or family members The Augustine tiny home is equipped with hookups for power and water, but you could also opt for the off-the-grid option with water tanks and solar panels. You can also choose a rooftop deck with a staircase, which makes for a lovely addition. There is also the option to opt for a wood-burning stove, although these modifications will increase the cost. The home is currently up for sale for US$75,000.",
