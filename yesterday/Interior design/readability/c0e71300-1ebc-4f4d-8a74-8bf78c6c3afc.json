  "text": "Born in Indonesia and raised in Singapore, Amanda Gunawan knew that she wanted to be an architect by the time she was 10 years old, and she carefully mapped out her journey from then on. Travel was a key element of her enrichment as she considered various structures while studying at the Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc). One particular building, however, made a lasting impression. Gunawan analyzed the Tama Art University Library in Japan via books and photos, but to view it in person, she had to make a 45-minute trek during a rainstorm. Yet nothing could have prepared her for the experience she had at the site. “I had never felt more inspired to become an architect,” she says. “Seeing the immense effort from every stakeholder reach such a level of perfection – and knowing it was achievable – filled me with a sense of assurance unlike anything I’d ever felt before.” Photo: Helena Price The Los Angeles-based design and build firm OWIU Design (Only Way Is Up Design) was founded in 2018. The brainchild of Gunawan and Joel Wong, the duo and their staff take on a range of projects, from furniture design to interiors and landscaping. At the studio, there is little difference between work and residential spaces, which fosters camaraderie among the group. Even team-building is relaxed, with activities taking place at the kitchen counter within the office. It’s no surprise then that OWIU Goods, the firm’s housewares line, began as a casual hobby when the team signed up for a membership at a nearby ceramics studio. “Our interior design clients began requesting specific ceramic pieces for their homes, so expanding in that direction just made sense for us,” Gunawan notes. “Before we knew it, everyone became so invested, and what started as small custom projects turned into hundreds, and eventually, thousands of orders. It all happened gradually and felt very organic.” Today, Amanda Gunawan joins us for Friday Five! 1. Beniya Mukayu in Japan Beniya Mukayu is a stunning ryokan (Japanese-style inn) located in the Ishikawa Prefecture of Japan. What sets this place apart is its deep commitment to art and design. Staying here feels like being in an art museum, with every element thoughtfully curated to create a unique experience of living with/ being surrounded by art. The ryokan features both permanent and rotating installations by renowned Japanese artists like Kenya Hara and Tatsuo Miyajima, blending art with everyday life like enjoying breakfast beside a calming installation, or relaxing in a library where the installation is part of the atmosphere. The interiors are filled with designer furniture and items are scattered throughout the rooms and shared spaces, adding to the aesthetic appeal. It is both a relaxing and inspiring place and I always have such a memorable experience. Not to mention this ryokan has the best kaiseki meal (coursed Japanese style dinner) of any ryokans I’ve been to. The photos are both taken by me. Photo: Official Berlin Marathon 2. Running Running is an integral part of my life and has very much shaped me into who I am today. It is a constant in my life – it’s there, it’s available for me. I can do it whenever I want, wherever I want, as long as I’ve got a pair of shoes. In that way, it’s almost meditative. When I’m running, I feel like I’m transported to a different world, a kind of vortex where I’m alone with my thoughts and completely in tune with my body. It’s taught me so much about life, bringing me face-to-face with some of my hardest but most important, truths. Running brings out parts of myself I might not always notice and helps me understand myself better. It’s built my sense of consistency and trust through self-discipline and a commitment to finish strong. But it’s also taught me to be forgiving, to remember that, like running, life is a journey with ups and downs. The key isn’t to keep score, but to enjoy the process. On that note, I’m absolutely obsessed with the brand ON. I’m proud to say I was an early adopter – I first discovered them when they had a tiny booth at a 5K run I joined in Singapore. I got my very first pair of ON shoes there, and I’ve been hooked ever since. I’ve occasionally “cheated” on that pair with other brands and always end up coming back. The brand has evolved so much since then, and it’s easy to see why. They constantly surprise their fans, pushing the boundaries in the running world with cutting-edge technology and some of the coolest products. Their choice of celebrity endorsements is so spot-on, and their creative creative campaigns are always super fresh. Not even exaggerating – I’ve bought around 20 pairs of ON shoes over the years and convinced a bunch of my friends to jump on board too. And honestly, despite having so many pairs, I’m always still sold on the newest release because each one has a super cool design I’ve never seen before. 3. The Local Project This is the ultimate resource book for anything and everything related to residential projects. Watching Local Project videos has become part of my wind-down routine before bed – their content is so beautifully shot and calming. They curate a selection of the most stunning projects out there and capture them in a way that’s almost poetic, with a cinematic touch. Their coffee table books are some of my favorites – I have them both at home and in my office, and I flip through them whenever I need a quick dose of inspiration. It’s also my default gift for people when I need to find one in short notice. 4. Flos Flos is my absolute favorite lighting company right now! I’ve got seven of their lights just in my home alone. They create functional art through lighting, transforming any space into something that feels like a museum, with each piece resembling an art installation. I love sitting at home, just taking in the view of my Flos pieces. Their lights go through an extensive process from concept to launch, with so much attention poured into perfecting every detail, and it really shows. 5. Chidy Wayne When I first saw Chidy’s artwork, I knew I wanted a piece for my home. His art is bold, dynamic and deeply evocative while remaining simple exploring themes of human connection. Each piece evokes raw energy with layered textures. It was one thing to see his work on a computer screen and another completely different experience seeing them in person, in all of its grandeur, with all of the little intricacies and details carefully hidden behind the bold strokes.
