  "text": "A luxurious rug has the power to transform any room, and picking the right one for your space really comes down to its texture. It’s easy to forget that every handmade rug is the result of painstaking craftsmanship and countless hours, touched by a team of of skilled artisans who oversee the production from start to end. Rugs come in such a huge variety of styles, drawing on techniques that have been around for hundreds of years. And it’s this detailed process that gives each rug a unique appearance. Here’s our guide to three rug textures we love and where to style them in your home. Pebbled If you like the look of a jute rug but are looking for something softer, then you might consider a rug with a ‘pebbled’ texture. These rugs often feature uncut pile (meaning the fibres are not trimmed or cut after the rug is woven) to create this bubbly, layered surface. From Armadillo’s new Panorama collection, both the Mason and Tempest rugs utilise a loom weaving technique with an exaggerated ‘loop’, and uncut pile, giving them a distinctive pebble-like effect designed to transport you to far-flung vistas among the great outdoors. They’re also made from premium wool, so that eye-catching texture has a cosy feeling underfoot. Since these rugs are less structured and have a bumpy surface, they’re best placed in a living room or bedroom where they can sit comfortably below larger pieces of furniture, rather than a busy dining space.",
