The Instinct 3 series, which launches on January 10th, was unveiled at a Rock Climbing Gym 2 miles off the Vegas Strip. The watch builds on the rugged reputation of its predecessors while introducing features that feel tailor-made for modern adventurers and fitness enthusiasts alike. The result? A smartwatch that blends durability, advanced technology, and user-centric design. This year’s model pushes the boundaries of what we expect from a workout watch. With a reinforced metal bezel, fresh AMOLED display options, and thoughtful touches like an integrated LED flashlight, the Instinct 3 is ready to handle everything from mountain treks to your daily commute. In fact we were even invited to do a session of indoor rock climbing with the watch on, just to see how effortless it was at tracking all the metrics with ease. Designer: Garmin Choose Your Display: AMOLED or Solar Garmin Instinct 3 with AMOLED Display For those who like options (and who doesn’t?), Garmin is offering the Instinct 3 in two distinct flavors: AMOLED and solar. Both come in two sizes—45mm and 50mm. The AMOLED models stand out with their crisp visuals, perfect for gym-goers and those who spend a lot of time indoors. The sharp contrast and vibrant colors make everything from notifications to your post-run stats pop. You’d expect a day’s worth of battery life from the watch, but the Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED models offer up to 24 days of battery life in smartwatch mode on a single charge. This is a significant improvement over many other AMOLED-equipped smartwatches, where battery life is often a trade-off for the enhanced screen quality. But don’t overlook the solar models, especially if your life is one long outdoor excursion. With optimal sunlight exposure, these versions promise unlimited battery life in smartwatch mode. That’s right, unlimited. If your workouts involve more trails and fewer treadmills, this could be your ultimate companion. It’s rare to find a watch that caters to both weekend warriors and hardcore adventurers, but the Instinct 3 pulls it off with ease. Garmin Instinct 3 with Solar Display Flashlight? On a Watch? Absolutely. An integrated LED flashlight might sound like a gimmick until you actually need it. Whether you’re rummaging through your bag at a campsite or fumbling for your keys after a late-night run, this feature is a lifesaver. The flashlight is small but powerful enough to handle unexpected moments in the dark. Beyond practicality, it adds a layer of personality to the watch. Who doesn’t love a wearable that surprises you with its usefulness? And unlike your phone’s flashlight, which usually leaves you juggling items or propping it awkwardly somewhere, this one stays strapped to your wrist, always ready to go. Built for the Grind The Instinct 3 is a multitasking beast, with preloaded activity profiles that cater to everything from hiking and biking to climbing and pickleball. Yes, pickleball. It’s clear Garmin wants this watch to be your one-stop fitness tracker, no matter your sport of choice. What makes it even more impressive is the health and wellness suite baked in. With 24 days of battery life on AMOLED models, you can track your sleep, stress, and energy levels without worrying about charging every night. The solar models take things up a notch, offering an endless power reserve in smartwatch mode if you can catch enough rays. Essentially, you’re getting data around the clock without the hassle of frequent recharges. Price, Availability, and Final Thoughts The Garmin Instinct 3 series starts at $399 for the 45mm solar model, climbing to $499 for the 50mm AMOLED version. Limited edition colorways add a touch of flair for those who want their adventure gear to stand out. Mark your calendars—availability kicks off on January 10, 2025. It’s hard not to admire what Garmin has done here. The Instinct 3 is tough without being clunky, smart without being pretentious, and surprisingly versatile. Whether you’re scaling a mountain, hitting the gym, or just navigating everyday life, this watch proves it’s got the stamina and smarts to keep up. Oh, and if you ever find yourself telling ghost stories around a campfire, that flashlight might just steal the show.",
