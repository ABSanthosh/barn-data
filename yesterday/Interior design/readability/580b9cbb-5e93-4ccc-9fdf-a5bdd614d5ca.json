  "text": "As you walk into Ataraxia‚Äîdesigned by Nazarius Shore‚Äîevery element will invite you to breathe just a little deeper. The designer brings their vision of modern tranquility to life in just 70 square meters, showing us that space is really no constraint. It‚Äôs the design eye that matters!¬† Let‚Äôs step inside and see how thoughtful design can turn minimalism into an art form ü§ç The living room is muted with just the right balance of color. A curved boucle sofa makes the space cozy as a sculptural coffee table makes a bold statement. The vibrant artwork adds this bold punch. We love the addition of green‚Äîthrough the textured rug and indoor plant. In the open-plan kitchen and dining, the cabinetry seamlessly blends with the walls. The large, round pendant light over the dining creates a statement. Simultaneously, the dark dining table adds contrast. A smart addition is the curved wooden column you see segregating and hallway; this acts as a divider, but it also provides storage space! Ah, the bedroom. It‚Äôs a modern minimalist haven with soft colors‚Äîand lots of natural light. The bed features soft pink upholstery, while the sea green nightstands add a beautiful contrast. There‚Äôs also plenty of wooden storage. And the floor-to-ceiling windows, of course, giving beautiful outdoor views. We‚Äôre huge fans of this home office. A glass separation makes sure you can see what‚Äôs going on in the home as you work‚Äîwhile blocking out the noise. The sleek bucket chair pairs well with the mid-century modern style desk. And both of them wonderfully complement the herringbone flooring! In this bathroom, the arched mirror with a colored frame adds a sense of height. The wall-mounted sink and toilet are space-savvy (and stylish). A special mention for the grid pattern on the tiles and matte black fixtures factoring in luxury. This bathroom interior continues the style you‚Äôd find in the rest of the home (we‚Äôre eyeing those soft hues of green and mustard)‚Äîjust with some addition of terracotta. The floating wooden vanity has soft edges while the open shower design defines the shower area‚Äîall without breaking up the space.",
