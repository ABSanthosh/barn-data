  "text": "Most of the traditional backpacking tents need some help to pitch or take considerable time if you are pitching it solo. This could spell trouble for backpackers who like to travel alone in territories unknown. If you are spending quite a chunk of your backcountry excursions erecting a tent, you are risking exposure to elements and wildlife. Not to mention the headache of the traditional tent’s weight. On the flip side, you lose out on comfort if you go for the lightweight options. Hitting the sweet spot between the two, the all-new Lunar Orbiter tent manages to merge comfort and convenience with a lightweight construction for solo campers. The ultra-light tent from Six Moon Designs forgoes traditional internal poles in favor of a wide exterior pole configuration that offers freestanding stability and fast pitching capability. Designer: Six Moon Designs The easy-pitch alternative of the Lunar Orbiter features a crisscross four-corner frame made of DAC Featherlite aluminum poles. The tent sets up quickly with hovering top sleeves, cross hub clips, and corner pockets. Its external pole design ensures that the walls are stretched outward, increasing the interior space. According to the outdoor gear company, the frame can withstand storm-worthy winds, rain, and snow, making Lunar Orbiter a perfect all-season companion in the backcountry. The tent has a hybrid single/double-wall design with plenty of mesh lining and a roll-back waterproof outer layer on the doors to provide ventilation and weather protection. Since it is designed for solo travelers, the tent offers 90 x 44 inches of sleeping area, enough for a grown man and his gear. The 48-inch high ceiling helps create an open feel inside the one-person tent. Additionally, there is a removable interior gear loft and two storage pockets, so you can keep your things safe and nearby without compromising valuable floor space. The dual vestibules further enhance its functionality. The only downside is that the tent weighs 2.8 lbs, which isn’t the most lightweight option on the market, which comes well near or under 2 lbs. However, if you are fine ignoring a little extra weight, this could be a good addition to your outdoor gear. The Lunar Orbiter is currently retailing at $435 and is an option that very well overshadows your conventional tent.",
