  "text": "The Cornice stacking stool by Nao Iwamatsu answers a quiet need in modern interiors: a seat that blends in, stacks elegantly, and feels at home in refined spaces. Its stepped profile, inspired by Japanese shrine roofs and Western architectural cornices, gives the stool a layered identity that stands out through subtlety rather than spectacle. Each stool’s proportions support use as a seat or a compact table, giving it a practical presence without visual clutter. The stacking function is central to Cornice’s appeal. Frequently, stackable stools sacrifice aesthetics for efficiency, but here, stacking becomes a display. When arranged in a column, the stools’ profiles create a rhythmic pattern, producing a sculptural effect that elevates storage into a visual feature. This functional stacking makes the collection suitable for spaces where flexibility is valued—living rooms, studios, and hospitality settings alike. Designer: Nao Iwamatsu Cornice is constructed from sustainable wood offcuts, each piece revealing a unique grain pattern. The surface feels smooth to the touch, with subtle variations that highlight the material’s origin. The stool’s finish is simple and natural, enhancing its quiet appeal. Stacking becomes more than a storage solution—when several stools are placed together, their profiles align to create a sculptural column, adding a dimensional quality to the space. The stool measures compactly, making it easy to move or reposition as needed. It serves as seating, a side table, or a sculptural accent, adapting to everyday routines without demanding attention. The form is functional, with a stable base and a comfortable, flat top. You can use it singularly or in multiples; in both cases, the Cornice remains visually consistent and easy to integrate with other furnishings. A secondary narrative runs through the design, connecting Cornice to its cultural references. The stepped edges nod to traditional Japanese architecture, while the name and outline reference Western molding. This combination gives the stool a sense of place that is both specific and adaptable. It sits comfortably in a variety of environments, holding onto its character without imposing itself. Cornice stacking stools are designed for contemporary living, where function and form coexist quietly. They invite daily use, blending into routines while offering moments of visual interest. The focus on material honesty, adaptability, and minimal presence ensures Cornice will continue to feel relevant, providing a quiet but thoughtful solution to everyday seating. They serves as fascinating furniture designs that offer both visual and practical pleasure, while their soft versataility allows them to fit with different changing environments.",
