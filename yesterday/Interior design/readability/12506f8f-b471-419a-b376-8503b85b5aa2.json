  "text": "Zaha Hadid Architects is building a scientific research center in Uzbekistan. They adopted a low-tech approach to create a comfortable climate. The building is visually appealing, and equipped with a clever passive cooling system that draws inspiration from the traditional local architecture. The center is named after the 15th-century poet, author, linguist, and statesman Alisher Navoi. Called the Alisher Navoi International Scientific Research Centre, it is marked by big swooping arches and expansive glazing. The form is inspired by the traditional wind-catching towers of  Central Asian and Middle Eastern Architecture, to remove the string from the desert heat. Designer: Zaha Hadid Architects The building is equipped with curvy supporting arches, which have been constructed from local bricks. The arches are built as hollow structures with openings that collect wind, and channel air into the building. During summer, the system will be offered support by electric fans and water misting to cool the air before it moves around the building. The hollow arched structures form a chimney effect, which enables the warmer air to escape through the openings at the top of each arch. The warm air rises naturally and escapes, building a pressure difference that pulls in the cooler air from lower levels, promoting ventilation throughout the building. “These cooling principles are enhanced by the day-night cycle, extracting warmer air while trapping cooler air below,” said Zaha Hadid Architects. “Coupled with the high thermal mass of the center’s structure, optimum conditions of comfort can be maintained with minimal energy consumption. Courtyards and skylights bring natural light into the heart of the center while deep roof overhangs provide its facades with effective solar shading in summer yet permit winter sun into the building to warm the interiors.” The interior will occupy 23,000 sq m, and will also include the Navoi State Museum of Literature. It also contains research areas, a workshop, and a repository housing a collection of 3,500 historical books and manuscripts. 13 permanent exhibition halls will be placed around a central courtyard, promoting collaboration between literary education, research, and performing arts.",
