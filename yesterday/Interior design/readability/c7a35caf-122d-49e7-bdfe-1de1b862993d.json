  "text": "Nothing has made see-through aesthetics for gadgets mainstream, and they are inspiring other bold brands to create transparent product lines that expose the internal components like complex circuitry. Another design variation that people swear by is glow-in-the-dark. DBrand has brought its unique take on spicing up things for geeks obsessed with their gadgets. Using a unique process to 3D print skins that have a tactile feel and accurate representation of the internal components, they’ve released a series in collaboration with famous YouTuber LinusTechTips. These cool skins are available for devices like the iPhone 16 series, 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro, flagship Galaxy devices, Pixel 9 series, Xbox Series X, and more. Designer: DBrand To maintain the authenticity of replicating complex innards on the surface of your gadgets, they hired PCB engineers to scrutinize every component. Pretty detailed this Circuit Board skin collection is, has to be said. The three-dimensional design gives each of these skins a slight texture, making this accessory hard to resist even though you might have used innumerable other options. The patterns have been created prioritizing aesthetics over functionality, hence, they are accurate representations of printed circuit boards and not actual PCB mirrored from the device in question. It is a mosaic of elements like capacitors, resistors and traces. The brand does offer a more authentic PCB appearance with the X-Ray skins line, but we are already drooling over the glow-in-the-dark feature. This version is manufactured with high-performance phosphorescent vinyl which appears glowing green when exposed to UV light. In normal lighting, it appears in an off-white yellowish tint. DBrand is including a UV flashlight in the package for the first batch of orders. If you are not a fan of the glow-in-the-dark feature, the Circuit Board skins can also be had in a triple black finish or orange-and-white design. In total this new line covers 741 different products, and the prices start from $40. For the initial period, a discount is also available, so you better buy it right away, if you’re totally into the idea.",
