  "text": "azOzone Explores Intersection of Light, Architecture, and DesignFounded in Paris in 2000 by Etienne Gounot and Eric Jähnke, Ozone was born from the shared vision of two engineers who left their established careers to explore the captivating interplay of light, architecture, and geometry. Over the past two decades, the firm has evolved into a revered name in luxury lighting, celebrated for its precision craftsmanship and artistic innovation. Ozone’s designs—distinguished by clean lines, refined finishes, and timeless elegance—have illuminated iconic spaces such as the Château de Versailles and Le Louvre, embodying a seamless blend of architectural and decorative elements.The company’s enduring legacy is further reflected in collaborations with iconic designers like Pierre Paulin and Michel Boyer, who brought their timeless creations into the present through Ozone’s contemporary lens. A milestone moment arrives on January 15th, 2025, with Ozone’s re-editions being included in the Mobilier National’s permanent collections, solidifying their influence where innovation and heritage intersect.‘Our light design philosophy is to reproduce moments when we are enveloped by a magical light, unified with the world and ourselves,’ the founders tell designboom. With this ethos, Ozone combines cutting-edge technologies like Dim to Warm with traditional Parisian craftsmanship, creating a unique harmony of modernity and heritage. Designboom spoke with Etienne Gounot and Eric Jähnke to delve deeper into Ozone’s history, creations, and vision for the future. Read on for the full interview.Ozone’s re-editions are part of Mobilier National’s permanent collections | image © Adrien Dirand for Ozoneinterview with Etienne Gounot \u0026 Eric Jähnkedesignboom (DB): Can you tell us more about Ozone’s history, when was it founded, how did the partnership begin, and how has the company evolved since 2000?Etienne Gounot \u0026 Eric Jähnke (EG \u0026 EJ): The friendship began in 1994 when we were working for a large industrial company. In 2000, the idea of starting a company together arose, leading to the creation of Ozone in December 2000. Light, architecture, and geometry were our inspirations to design the first models. Since then, we have developed custom pieces and collections of lighting designed by us or renowned designers and architects.Ozone’s re-editions are part of Mobilier National’s permanent collections | image © Adrien Dirand for Ozone DB: What sets Ozone apart in the luxury lighting industry?EG \u0026 EJ: Three elements are very specific to Ozone. First of all, our creations are both architectural and decorative, we would say. In our studio, we work both the product itself in its design, details, and finishes and on the light output when the product is switched on: light quantity and quality, color rendering, temperature, glare etc. Second, our aesthetic is very consistent from one collection to the next, even if the designers are not the same: clean lines, geometry, elegance, presence, and absence. Last but not least, we are very close to the best Parisian craftsmanship and have been constantly working on the renovation of the French heritage: Chateau de Versailles, Notre Dame, Le Louvre. The same hands manufacture the lighting elements, such as the solid onyx parts for the Embrun collection or the careful metal polishing of the Classique collection.Ozone’s re-editions are part of Mobilier National’s permanent collections | image © Adrien Dirand for Ozone DB: Ozone’s products are assembled by hand in your Paris workshop. Tell us more about the space—what benefits do you see in having most of the company’s departments under the same roof, and how important are craftsmanship and the human touch in today’s design world for you?EG \u0026 EJ: From the outset, we found it important to have our own workshop to develop mock-ups, prototypes, light and material innovations, and then to control the quality during the manufacturing. We have many partners outside the company, as we mentioned before; nevertheless, we visit them every week to ensure smooth coordination and a high-quality level. The human touch gives a soul to the production of pieces that are today mainly standardized and cost-oriented.Ozone’s atelier in Paris | image courtesy of Giorgio MarafiotiDB: Ozone’s Dim to Warm technology mimics the natural transition of sunlight. Can you tell us more about this technology, and how the diurnal cycle and other elements found in nature shape your design philosophy? EG \u0026 EJ: The sun, the sky, the clouds with their thousand shades are an endless source of inspiration. Our light design philosophy is to reproduce moments when we are enveloped by a magical light, unified with the world and ourselves. The Dim to Warm technology help creating very warm moods, like during sunrises or sunsets.Furtiv LP | image courtesy of OzoneDB: Collections like Furtiv and Untitled show a strong architectural influence. How do you incorporate architectural principles in your lighting designs?EG \u0026 EJ: Light is at the service of architecture. Light reveals a space and makes it alive. The Furtiv and Untitled collections are a tribute to the lines and volumes of modern architecture. They blend seamlessly in it. If in mirror nickel finish, they almost vanish. And, by the magic of pure geometry, they fit perfectly into classical interiors as well.",
