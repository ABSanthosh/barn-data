  "text": "I can only imagine the look on the TSA’s face as you walk up to them with a massive AirPods case strapped to your back. You’ll definitely get a few looks from the people around you, and maybe a few covert videos as you pop open the lid to reveal two massive AirPods-looking containers inside the bag… only for them to slide out and be, well, actual containers. Designed by New York-based Bravest Studios, the AirPack is equal parts EDC and social commentary. The quirky design enlarges the AirPods to the size of a 44-liter backpack, playing on scale, design, and familiarity in a way that should easily grab everyone’s attention. There’s nothing ‘special’ about the backpack’s design if you look at it just objectively. But unless you’ve lived under a rock for the past decade, just a glance at the AirPack will instantly make you think, “Did that guy just walk past me with a massive AirPods case strapped to his back??” Designer: Bravest Studios The design’s meant to grab eyeballs, something fairly important in today’s economy. It comes with a fairly surprising level of detail. The top of the bag pops up exactly like an AirPods case’s lid, revealing two AirPods-shaped masses on the inside. The interior of the lid has the negative indentations to make space for the ‘AirPods’, and a close look reveals a fairly impressive level of detail with the hinge mechanism too. However, slide the AirPods out and you’ll realize that they’re just regular containers. Designed to hold anything from clothes to sneakers, or even some of your tech and EDC, the two containers organize your belongings into ‘left’ and ‘right’ channels. Zippers mean you can use each container individually too, although they make much more sense when popped into the backpack! Besides, there’s even space for a laptop in the backpack, although images don’t really show where you’d store your laptop or how you’d access it. I’m inclined to believe Bravest Studios, though. That’s because the AirPack isn’t a concept or vaporware. It’s a real product that will go on sale at Bravest’s NYC Soho popup on the 19th of July. There’s no word on pricing yet (although expect this limited-edition drop to be on the more expensive side), but if you can afford the AirPack, promise me you won’t desecrate it with those godawful Labubu accessories. I beg you.",
