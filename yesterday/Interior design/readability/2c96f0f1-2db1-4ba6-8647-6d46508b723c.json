  "text": "aileen de la ree valencia collaborates with nush wadiaDesigned and built as a collaboration, between Aileen De La Ree Valencia and Nush Wadia, the ButtonBack Chair is an exploration in materiality, form, and ergonomics. Crafted primarily from Cherry wood with accents of Maple, the chair features an intriguing, asymmetric design with organic contours and a sole armrest.With a solid-wood seat and back, the goal of the design was to defy conventional standards of aesthetics and comfort. Each undulation was precisely carved, emphasizing the wood’s grain and creating a contrast of hard and soft edges across the chair’s surface. The front panel disrupts the symmetry of the design, while the seat-to-armrest detail transitions between the chair’s smooth and hard edges, enhancing both visual and tactile traits.all images courtesy of Nush Wadiabuttonback chair explores form, materiality, and ergonomicsThe ButtonBack Chair’s structure relies on two stretchers, which, together with the front panel, side leg, and back leg, make up the chair’s frame. The primary stretcher runs between the front panel and the back leg, while the secondary stretcher supports the armrest by linking it to the primary. The backrest and armrest are secured to the frame using dowels, while the seat itself is dry-fastened to the stretchers and front panel. These technical choices provide structural stability, complementing the chair’s distinct silhouette. True to its name, the ButtonBack Chair features four Maple accents on the backrest, breaking up the monotony of the rich Cherry wood with lighter, contrasting elements. Alongside the armrest, these accents provide subtle highlights, reducing the visual weight of the chair. Designers Aileen De La Ree Valencia (see more here) and Nush Wadia (see more here) embraced the wood’s natural characteristics, with the Cherry lumber’s volume allowing freedom to carve an ‘imperfect’ form that showcases knots and undulating surfaces.Aileen De La Ree Valencia and Nush Wadia complete the ButtonBack Chairthe back is carved out using the CNC to ensure that it’s profile is was perfectly shaped for comfortan ‘imperfect’ form that showcases knots and undulating surfacescrafted primarily from Cherry woodthe chair gets its name from the four Maple ornamentsthe edges of the chair transition gracefully between hard and soft, adding a playful characterMaple wood armrest",
