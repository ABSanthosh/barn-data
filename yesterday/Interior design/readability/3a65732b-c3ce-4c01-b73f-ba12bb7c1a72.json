  "text": "jacob boyd’s biodegradable plant vessel is made of recycled pulpIndustrial designer Jacob Boyd presents Bough Pot, a biodegradable plant vessel that connects community center users and urban farming initiatives. Designed in collaboration with Carleton University and a local community center, the pot is made from materials like recycled pulp, bound with rice paste, and it’s produced in the centers themselves using 3D printed compression molds. Since the Bough Pots are fully decomposable, vegetables can be planted directly in the soil without removing the plant from the vessel, simplifying the planting process and reducing waste.all images courtesy of Jacob Boydthe bough pot aims to link users with urban farmsDeveloped by Vancouver-based Jacob Boyd to create a system that links users with urban farms, the Bough Pot is gifted to community center visitors, each sown with a vegetable seed. Users care for the pot at home, and in the spring, they return it to be planted at local urban farms. The vessel is available in two variations, a handleless and a handled one. Handled versions support ease of transportation between users’ homes and farms. The inclusion of the handle enhances the mobility of the pot, facilitating the exchange between users and the urban farm network. The pot’s design also features impressions and protrusions that create a nestling effect when placed in series, allowing users to express their creativity through custom arrangements. The open-source molds are available for free, encouraging wider use and production.industrial designer Jacob Boyd presents Bough Pota biodegradable plant vessel that fosters a connection between community centers and urban farmingdesigned in collaboration with Carleton University and a local community centerthe pot is made from biodegradable materials like recycled pulp and bound with rice pasteproduced in the centers themselves using 3D printed compression molds",
