  "text": "The finalists for the 39th annual Dulux Colour Awards have been announced! An industry-leading panel has selected 88 projects from nearly 500 entries representing the best use of colour across commercial, public, hospitality, workplace, retail, installation, multi-residential, single-residential, and student projects in Australia and New Zealand. Themes and trends from this year’s finalists include coloured ceilings and distinctive wall treatments. ‘The judges remarked upon the strength of colour-blocking interior surfaces, as well as the bold use of murals in retail and studio environments,’ says Andrea Lucena Orr, Dulux colour and communications manager. Hues of burgundy, gold-yellows, and sage greens lead the bolder palettes in private residential domains. Very few projects skip vibrant colour altogether, with some featuring entire rooms drenched in saturated tones, such as berry colours in both Claremont by WOWOWA Architecture, and Coronation House by Brunsdon Studio. Other projects introduce colour more sparingly, but to equally dramatic effect, including Mt Eden Garden House by Pac Studio with a skylight painted yellow for a golden glow, and Elonera House by Studio Doherty that highlights statement joinery. Multiple projects explore ‘modern neutrals’ — colours soft enough to form a calming backdrop, instead of safer shades of black and stark white. Kennedy Nolan explores this to a tee in Rosherville House, which pairs warm timbers with chocolatey browns and cool bluey-greens. ‘There is such artistry in the tonal graduations we’re seeing in exteriors and interiors alike, to the extent that form, material, landscape, and plays of light across the day have all been considered in the nuanced specification,’ says Andrea. The 39th Dulux Colour Awards winners will be announced at an exclusive event at the National Gallery of Victoria on Wednesday May 28, 2025.
