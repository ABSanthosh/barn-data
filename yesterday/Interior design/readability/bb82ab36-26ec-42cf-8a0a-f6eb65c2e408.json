  "description": "The Autodesk Fusion team is excited to announce the second annual Autodesk Fusion Prize as part of the 2025 Core77 Design Awards. This award recognizes the most outstanding project that utilized Autodesk Fusion product development software from all entries in this year's awards program – student and professional, across all 20 categories. This recognition not only highlights the winner's exceptional work but also underscores their ability to leverage advanced, modern design tools to create impactful solutions.What is Autodesk Fusion? If you're not familiar with Autodesk Fusion, let's start there. Autodesk Fusion is a cloud-based 3D CAD, CAM, CAE and PCB design tool for product design and manufacturing. It combines industrial and mechanical design, simulation, collaboration/data management, and machining in a single product. Fusion is widely used by designers, engineers, and manufacturers to streamline their product development process from concept to production. The Vivid Nine lighting collection for R\u0026S Robertson.Industrial design firm Vivid Nine, for example, used Autodesk Fusion when designing a lighting collection for their client R\u0026S Robertson. Thanks to Fusion being a cloud-based tool, the Vivid Nine team could design from anywhere and easily collaborate with teammates. To support its strong commitment to sustainability, the Vivid Nine team also leveraged Fusion's Manufacturing Sustainability Insights (MSI) Add-on to calculate the carbon footprint of their designs, optimize products for reduced carbon emissions, and enhance sustainability reports that they generate for their clients.Leveraging the Fusion MSI Vivivd Nine calculated the carbon footprint of their design.What's in it for me?Alright, back to the prize. The winner of the Autodesk Fusion Prize will receive a special prize from Autodesk (including a feature on the Fusion Blog) and a coveted Core77 Design Award trophy (seriously, if you haven't seen how cool the infamous trophies are yet, go take a look then circle back).Zexi Ye won the Core77 Design Awards 2024 Fusion prize.Read all about Adæpt by Zexi Ye, the Core77 Design Awards 2024 Fusion winner here.Adæpt, designed by Zexi Ye, took home last year's Autodesk Fusion prize for its exceptional concept. The product is a computer-accessible tool that enables people with cerebral palsy to freely and independently access the digital world thanks to its easy-to-use touchpad, tactile navigation, remote assistance and more. We also enjoyed hearing how Fusion enabled Zexi to transition seamlessly from physical to digital prototyping and vice versa. This helped ensure that the final design met the ergonomic needs of users with cerebral palsy and could accommodate various hand postures and motor skill abilities.The Mesh environment in Fusion was particularly helpful for Zexi during the 3D modeling stage. \"The 'do not capture design history' and 'file history' features allow me to create without fear,\" he explains. \"When it's time for a quick visualization, I switch to the rendering panel to see what the product looks like with real materials.\" Learn more about Adæpt here.How to enter the Core77 Design Awards 2025The first step on the path to winning the Autodesk Fusion Prize is to enter the Core77 Design Awards. We encourage all designers and engineers who have utilized Fusion software in their submissions – both student and professional - to enter this year's awards. Towards the end of your application, you'll have the option to simply check a box for whether or not you used Fusion. If you did use Fusion for your project – go ahead and check that box, baby!This is an incredible opportunity to gain recognition for your work and to be celebrated by Core77, Autodesk, and the wider design community. Don't miss your chance to vie for the Autodesk Fusion Prize and showcase your innovative projects to the world. We look forward to seeing the amazing projects that you have created with Fusion software. Submit your entries to the Core77 Design Awards 2025 today! Good luck to all the participants!
