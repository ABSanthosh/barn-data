  "text": "The mudbrick house of Effie Mann and Simon Hill leaves an impression. The couple were immediately taken by the property, which was designed and built in the 1980s by the original owner, artist Paul Stork, then later extended by local architect Gary Gilmour. Having grown up in the area, and already living nearby in a 1970s brick Fasham Johnson home, Effie and Simon were already well aware of the charming artist residences in the area, but this house in particular offered something special. ‘I’d always dreamed of living in a house with red brick floors, and then when we walked in, it was just like coming home. It had such warmth with its rich, recycled timbers and bricks, and its charmingly homemade feel,’ says Effie. ‘It feels as though someone poured their soul into it.’ Effie and Simon’s boys, Jesse and Sonny, agreed. ‘The boys started running around getting lost in the garden up the back, so we knew it would make a magical place for them to play and build cubbies.’ The couple went above their budget to make the property their own, and not long after welcomed their third child, Lenny, born in the home by candlelight. The history of the home has been passed down through its various owners. Originally a goose farm, former owner Paul used the mudbrick shed on site as his painting studio, before building the main house. ‘He would sleep in the tiny space too,’ says Effie. ‘There is a little painting of a sunset on the mudbrick wall just inside the door, which he painted when it was his studio. It’s amazing to have this little tangible piece of history to enjoy.’ The house itself was crafted using recycled bricks and timber – ironbark, jarrah, Tasmanian oak floorboards, Oregon roof trusses, and even some large vertical posts reclaimed from the old Eltham railway bridge when it was dismantled. The mudbricks were made in Christmas Hills, and mudbrick paints were sourced from Grimes \u0026 Sons in Research just up the road. Effie and Simon have filled the house with mostly timber furniture and handmade pieces that speak to this history, including Jesse’s bed made by Effie’s brother, and bedside tables made by Simon’s mum. The timber dining table was an engagement present from Effie’s parents that’s now marked with memories of young family life. Nothing is too precious, so there’s no plans of upgrading the family’s 18-year-old couch anytime soon! The layout of the home works for the young family — doubling as a quasi-playground with its split levels, which also allows Effie and Simon to supervise the boys while in the kitchen, or looking down from their bedroom. ‘The boys have turned the mezzanine into a bit of a Lego and book lair and it’s so nice when we’re cooking dinner to have them up there chilling out,’ says Effie. ‘We feel like we have them close to us, and they feel as though they have their own space, so it works well for everyone.’ Other times you’ll find the family outside in the garden, jumping on the trampoline with the neighbour who climbs over the fence, in the backyard spa under the stars, or out and about in Warrandyte. ‘Warrandyte is a lovely mix of natural beauty, gold rush history, and creative history gifted by the artists who called the place home in the 60s and 70s, and then the sweet little town with its pub and cafes and funny mix of shops,’ says Effie. ‘In autumn, when we drive to school, the sun is sparkling on the river and it’s all misty and beautiful.’",
