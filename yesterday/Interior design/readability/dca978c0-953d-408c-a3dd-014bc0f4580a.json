Your layout, structure, architecture, and furniture can all be perfect, but without art on the walls, your space will always feel a little empty and devoid of personality. Whether it’s a bold abstract painting or a serene landscape photograph, the right piece can not only elevate your interior design, but reflect your unique style as well. However, choosing and displaying art isn’t as simple as it seems. Many homeowners make common art mistakes that can detract from the overall aesthetic of their space. In this article, we will explore some of these pitfalls and offer practical tips to help you avoid them. Ignoring the Scale and Proportion One common mistake is neglecting the scale and proportion of art pieces in relation to the room. A small piece of art can get lost on a large wall, while an oversized piece can overwhelm a small space. It’s important to consider the dimensions of both the artwork and the wall space where it will be displayed. A good rule of thumb is to choose art that takes up about two-thirds to three-quarters of the wall space (for a single piece, gallery walls can have more variety in size). Additionally, consider the furniture and other elements in the room to make sure the art complements the overall layout.

The right lighting can highlight the colors, textures, and details of a piece, making it a focal point in the room. Natural light is ideal, but it’s not always available or sufficient. Consider using track lighting, picture lights, or wall sconces to illuminate your art instead. Be mindful of the type of bulbs you use, as different bulbs can affect the appearance of colors. Most art does well with soft, warm lighting, but it’s up to you to discover what type of lighting works the best for you collection. You spent so much time picking your pieces, you want to see them at their best! Photo Credit: Unsplash / Joyce Hankins Failing to Consider the Room’s Color Palette We should all choose the art we love for a room, yes, but we should also make sure it doesn’t fight with the existing furniture. A piece of art with clashing colors can disrupt the harmony and overall look of a space, while art that compliments the room’s colors can tie the design together beautifully. When selecting art, consider the dominant and accent colors in the room. Look for pieces that incorporate these colors or provide a pleasing contrast. Also, think about the mood you want to create. Warm colors can add energy, while cool colors create a more calming air.

Many people make the mistake of hanging art haphazardly, resulting in a disjointed and cluttered appearance. To avoid this, plan your arrangement before hanging any pieces. Consider the spacing between artworks and the alignment of frames. Try taking a photo of your wall and sketching some layout ideas onto it, or arrange your art on the floor to see what it’ll all look like together. Take the time to carefully hang and align every piece so it looks professional and cohesive once it’s all together. Photo Credit: Unsplash / ASR Design Studio Choosing Art That Doesn’t Reflect Personal Style One of the most frequent mistakes people make when selecting art is choosing pieces that don’t align with their personal style. It’s easy to be swayed by trends or the opinions of others, but art should be a reflection of your tastes and preferences, no one else’s. Choosing art that resonates with you personally will bring you joy every time you see it, and your home should be making you happy at every turn! Take the time to explore different styles, mediums, and artists to discover what truly speaks to you. Remember, your home is an extension of yourself, and the art you choose should tell your story. Photo Credit: Unsplash / Steph Wilson Choosing and displaying art thoughtfully can have not only a profound impact on your home, but also your enjoyment it. A room with bare walls will always feel uncomfortable, but art can breathe life into it, can make it really feel whole and cohesive. As much as you want to follow interior design trends, styles, and placements, truly the most important thing about the art that you hang is that you love it. Put that first and the rest will follow.
