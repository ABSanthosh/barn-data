Please Read Our Disclosure Policy here Sources: Wicker trunk // White Lamp by Bed // Rug / Blue and White Chinoiserie Lamp by Teal Chair // Ruffle Striped Pillow on Chair // Similar Teal Chair This post is in partnership with Wayfair For the last few years I’ve set aside the month of January to focus on making small updates to our bedroom. This month, inspired by my phrase for the year “a place for everything and everything in its place” I decided to work on beautifying and organizing our room (along with other areas of our home). When I saw this wicker trunk at Wayfair, I knew it would be a charming solution for one of our bedroom storage issues. Today I’ll share more about my basket and why it’s solved this problem beautifully for us! I love organizing with baskets and have added several other new pretty ones to our home, too. Here’s a peek of a few of my other favorites which I’ll share about in a future post! Click here for above sources We don’t have a large room, nor a lot of closet space, so I wanted to come up with some creative options to store things we use often. One source of storage frustration for us in this house has been a pile of blankets. Blankets can take up a lot of room. Where do you keep extra blankets when you don’t have a linen closet or extra space? I decided I didn’t want blankets to continue to take up precious space in our closet, so I’m thrilled to have found this basket! It is lined with a removable liner, so it’s perfect for storing blankets, sheets, mattress pads or even bed pillows. It could really hold anything from books to linens to hobbies and more! A trunk with a lid is ideal because it keeps the room looking tidier than an open basket and the blankets are still easy to access. The size of this one is so nice for the end of our bed, or even to tuck in a corner or against a wall. Unlike a large storage piece or wider trunk, the basket is tall enough to hold a lot but takes up very little floor space and is shallow enough to go just about anywhere. The rattan is a pleasant mix of warm browns and soft grays along with rope accents. The convenient handles make it easier to transport it. I love the personality and texture it adds to the room, too! I use all kinds of baskets and trunks for storing so many things around the house, including to: stash (useful) clutterkeep dog itemsorganize seasonal flowers and branchesstore paperwork hold tableclothsorganize gameshold cords and electronicsfold blankets and pillow covershide bathroom essentialshold remotes and keysand so much more! Are you organizing your home this month, too?
