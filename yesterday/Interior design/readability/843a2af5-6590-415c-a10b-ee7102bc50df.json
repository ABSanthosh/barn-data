Your decor looks right, your bed is comfortable, so what’s wrong? Here are some of the biggest bedroom design and layout mistakes you might be making and how to fix them. Blocking Natural Light Windows are a major asset in any bedroom, yet still people choose to block them with furniture or heavy curtains. Natural light makes a space feel open while also improving mood and sleep quality, so it’s important to let it pour in when you can. If a dresser, floor mirror, or other large pieces are covering part of a window, try moving them elsewhere, and use sheer curtains or adjustable blinds over blackout curtains to let in as much daylight as possible while still maintaining privacy.

A bed pushed into a tight corner can make getting in and out difficult, while placing it directly across from a doorway can feel unsettling. The best position is usually centered on a main wall with space on both sides for balance, but corner beds can sometimes work as well. If your layout is tricky, experiment with different placements to find what feels most comfortable and has the best flow. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / pro_creator Choosing the Wrong Nightstands Nightstands are often an afterthought, but they play a big role in both function and aesthetics in a bedroom. A nightstand that’s too low or too high compared to the bed can be awkward to use. A tiny one with no storage may not hold everything you need, while an oversized one can take up too much space. Ideally, your nightstand should be about the same height as your mattress and have enough surface area for a lamp, a book, and whatever else you need within reach. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / AnnaStills Forgetting to Add Soft Textures A bedroom without soft textures (besides your comforter or duvet that is) can feel cold and uninviting. Hard furniture surfaces, bare floors, and minimal bedding may look clean, but they don’t create a cozy atmosphere. Adding plush elements like a soft area rug, layered bedding, and cushioned seating can make the room feel more comfortable. Even small touches, like throw pillows or a textured blanket, can make a big difference in warmth and style. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / emneemsphotos Using Too Many Small Decor Pieces Decor adds personality, sure, but too many small items can make a bedroom look cluttered rather than stylish. A collection of tiny frames or trinkets can quickly overwhelm the space. Instead, focus on a few larger statement pieces like a bold headboard, an oversized piece of art, or a well-placed houseplant. This helps keep the room from feeling chaotic, which can affect how restful you feel in the space. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / Pressmaster Neglecting Proper Closet Organization A messy closet can affect how the entire bedroom feels. When storage isn’t set up efficiently, clothes and accessories tend to spill out into the main space, piling up on any open surface that’s available. Make use of organizers, shelves, and hanging systems to keep things neat. If you don’t have a built-in closet, consider using an armoire or garment rack to store clothes while keeping the rest of the room tidy and open. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / Photology75 A well-designed bedroom is about so much more than looks. It has to be comfortable and relaxing, gentle enough to ease us into sleep but also stylish (to our personal tastes that is) enough for us to feel safe when we’re in it. Whether it’s adjusting the amount of natural light you get, organizing your closet, or rethinking where you put your bed, small changes can transform the entire feel of the room.
