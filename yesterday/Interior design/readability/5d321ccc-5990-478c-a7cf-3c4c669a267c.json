Among the highlights is the Orgatec debut of the brand’s 2024 designs, Rei, Buffa, and Omnia, as well as the latest additions to the versatile Spectrum System collection. Known for integrating adaptability, modularity, and elegance, Prostoria’s collections offer a fresh perspective on functional yet aesthetically sophisticated solutions for hospitality and office settings. Visitors were able to explore the complete collection at the company’s ‘Problem Solver’s Mind, Maker’s Heart’ stand, with a more intimate selection available at the Design Post exhibition.

Lastly, Omnia, designed by Neisako, is a sophisticated collection of sofas and armchairs that exudes a sense of glamour, lending an air of refined elegance to any space.Jugo, design by Numen/ForUseIn addition to new releases, Prostoria’s exhibition further includes a selection of its iconic designs, such as the Polygon chair, Sabot modular sofa, Monk upholstered chairs, and the Jugo outdoor collection, each embodying the brand’s commitment to comfort, longevity, and sustainable design.
