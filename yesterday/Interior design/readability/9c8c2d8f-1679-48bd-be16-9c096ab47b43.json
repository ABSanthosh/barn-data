  "description": "For ID-curious readers who want to dip their toe in the pool, here's an online course on Concept Sketching for Industrial Design. It's taught by Adam Miklosi, a freelance industrial designer based in Budapest. (Miklosi's no veteran, but he's been in the ID game for a decade and clearly has skills.) \"You'll explore the art of sketching, covering essential techniques and industrial product design, using both analog and digital tools to enhance your productivity and outcomes.\" \"Immerse yourself in a process that spans from initial research to the development of standalone design concepts. Learn to seamlessly integrate human and natural design elements, showcasing how functionality and form can coexist in perfect harmony.\" The course consists of 16 video lessons that you do on your own time. The lessons build towards \"The final project [which] involves developing two design concepts based on a specific brief,\" Miklosi writes. \"You will use the techniques learned to research, sketch, and ultimately present your ideas, demonstrating your ability to integrate functionality and aesthetics into innovative designs.\" The course runs $50.",
