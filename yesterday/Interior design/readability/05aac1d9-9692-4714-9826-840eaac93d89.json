  "text": "Serbian basketball genius Nikola Jokic, who plays a center for the Denver Nuggets, has crept up into the list of all-time NBA greats most quietly, if you would agree. Often regarded as the greatest draft steal in NBA history, Jokic aka “the Joker” within the professional basketball circles, now has a signature shoe to reflect his style and strength. At an event themed “Disrupting The Game,” organized at the Ball Arena in Denver, Colorado; 361° did really disrupt the court code with the new shoe called the JOKER 1 after the NBA superstar. This was a highly anticipated launch event, not only for all Joker fans, but for the Chinese sporting brand as well, that with the launch making its global presence felt. Designer: 361° With the JOKER 1 to his name, Jokic has earned himself a place amid the legendary league of players featuring silhouette etched with their name (branding in most cases to be precise). The JOKER 1 is Jokic’s first signature shoe and also sort of debut for 361° into the international basketball footwear arena with attachment to his name. The Joker was seen donning the signature silhouette when Denver Nuggets took on the Golden State Warriors earlier this week. One of its kind shoe on the court, the JOKER 1 draws inspiration from the iconic Batman character evident in its purple upper and green sole. The Joker-themed colorway silhouette is meticulously crafted keeping Jokic’s on-field requirements, playing style, and personality. All the details this, right from the bold colorway to the high-performance features are aligned with lightweight comfort, ultralight cushioning for optimal responsiveness, and material usage to deliver breathability. The JOKER 1 is now available in the U.S. and is likely to make European debut on December 7 in Serbia—Jokic’s home nation. It will then release in China on December 14.",
