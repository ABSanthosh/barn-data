  "text": "Soft; warm; effortlessly stylish. The Velvet Apartment by IM Interiors is a cozy retreat wrapped in modern design. Every element is carefully layered to feel calm, lived-in, and luxurious. It’s where comfort meets curation, and every corner invites you to stay a little longer. Let’s take a closer look inside this velvet-wrapped dream. The foyer is warm and welcoming, styled with natural wood paneling. A wavy full-length mirror adds an artistic touch, while soft lighting and pale flooring keep things airy and bright. A built-in bench and minimalist coat hooks keep things practical. The heart of the apartment is all about softness and flow. A plush velvet sofa in dusty rose curves gently around the room. Rounded edges and low profiles make it feel both open and intimate. A neutral rug underfoot, sculptural lighting above, and accents in warm wood and brass pull everything together. Textural, tactile, and beautifully grounded. The dining space features a live-edge wood table with sculptural metal legs. Surrounding it are boucle-upholstered chairs with natural wood frames. Neutral tones let the textures do the talking, while a ceramic vase and dried stems add an organic touch. The kitchen pairs matte white cabinetry with rich wood grain panels for a clean yet cozy feel. A central island with glass-front storage doubles as a design feature and hosting hub. Under-cabinet lighting adds a soft glow, while the linear pendant above creates just the right amount of contrast. The bedroom in the Velvet Apartment features a low, upholstered bed framed by clean paneling and diffused pendant lights. A sculptural dresser and organic decor add subtle style. Floor-to-ceiling curtains filter in just the right amount of morning light. It’s a space made for slowing down. Clean lines, soft lighting, and natural textures set the tone. The bathroom features warm wood cabinetry, sand-toned stone tiles, and a walk-in shower with built-in niches. A floating vanity and wall-mounted fixtures keep the look minimal and modern.",
