  "text": "The Cardabelle offers a modern approach to downsizing, skillfully balancing space limitations and comfort to accommodate up to two people for a full-time mobile lifestyle. It features a compact length of just 20 ft (6 m) and is designed by France’s Baluchon. It is built on a double-axle trailer and features a stylish finish of red cedar and aluminum. It is equipped with a spruce frame, which is insulated with eco-friendly materials like recycled cotton, linen, and hemp. It is half the length of North American models like the Tellico, making it more portable, and an ideal option for those who prefer a life on the road. This design focuses on mobility and sustainability, offering a cozy and efficient living space for life on the go. Designer: Baluchon The entrance of the home leads directly into the living room, which is compact yet feels spacious due to ample glazing. The living area includes a sofa bed with built-in storage and shelving above. Most of the ground floor space is occupied by the kitchen. It is quite well-equipped, featuring an oven, fridge, two-burner propane stove, sink, and cabinetry. The kitchen is also equipped with solid oak countertops and includes a breakfast bar for two, which also serves as a home office space. This section includes a nook to store the owner’s work laptop, adding functionality of the space. The bathroom is thoughtfully positioned on the opposite end of the home from the living room, offering a sense of privacy and separation. You can access it through the kitchen. It is well-equipped with essential amenities, including a modern shower, a sleek vanity sink, and a functional toilet. The design demonstrates how comfort and convenience can be prioritized in a compact space as well. The tiny house includes a single bedroom, which can be accessed by a staircase that doubles as a storage solution, maximizing the use of space. This staircase not only provides access to the sleeping area but also offers practical storage options for personal belongings. The bedroom features a cozy loft style, with a low ceiling that enhances the intimate feel. It accommodates a comfortable double bed and includes additional storage to keep the area organized and clutter-free. The Cardabelle functions as a modern and comfortable tiny home that serves as a full-time residence in a compact body. We are unsure of the price, but Baluchon homes usually start at around roughly US$87,000. It functions as a serene retreat, allowing the residents to feel at home and ease.",
