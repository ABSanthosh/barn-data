A mobile home is any movable dwelling with adequate sleeping, eating, and lounging spaces. The trend of converting old vehicles like vans, school buses, or pickup trucks into mobile habitats is popular. This DIY project by Christopher McKinnon, a travel enthusiast from Washington, is essentially a 1990 Ford F-350 transformed into a cozy truck camper. McKinnon’s creation, featuring a cabin-like design, panoramic windows, and a warm wood interior, highlights the potential of repurposing old vehicles with skill and creativity. Designer: Christopher Mckinnon The camper conversion is built on a Ford F-350 with a 460 gas engine and a five-speed manual transmission. Christopher McKinnon, who found the F-250’s floor space too limited, chose the F-350 for its larger 12-ft by 8-ft flatbed, allowing for a roomier, cabin-like camper. The camper is fully insulated, with cedar-treated polyurethane on the front and back and durable siding on the sides for better weather resistance. A rear liftgate carries his motorcycle, and an overhang offers weather protection. It includes large windows on one side and the back, providing panoramic views and a connection to the outdoors. The interior features a simple, open layout to maintain spaciousness, enhanced by a large wall mirror that adds depth. The overcab section houses a full-size bed with 8-inch memory foam. Cooking essentials are stored in custom cabinets that keep them hidden when not in use, while a built-in bench by the window serves as seating and firewood storage. A Cubic Mini Grizzly wood-burning stove keeps the space warm. Near the entrance, a wall organizer holds wood processing tools, and a closet contains the electric system. Storage cabinets, including one concealing a propane cooktop, and a bench next to the bed with a 40-liter Iceco refrigerator, complete the setup. Chris initially included a collapsible sink but later removed it due to lack of use. The truck camper is equipped with a range of amenities to enhance comfort and functionality. It features a 5.1 surround sound system for entertainment, an AC unit to keep the interior cool, and a bookshelf for storing reading materials. A space-saving, collapsible table provides a convenient spot for dining or working on a laptop. It also includes a 30-gallon fresh water tank with a pump that ensures a steady water supply. Designed for off-grid adventures, this camper is powered by a solar system consisting of 800 watts of solar panels, a 60-amp charge controller, a 2,000-watt inverter, and a 200-Ah 12.8V battery. This setup allows for sustainable energy use, making it ideal for remote travel.",
