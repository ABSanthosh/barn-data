  "text": "If there’s one thing for sure, it’s that Emma and Tom Lane don’t do things by halves. The co-founders of The Range Estates have proved their unflinching ability to take on big projects, first with The Farm in Byron Bay and then with their breathtaking old home, The Range, in Coopers Shoot in the Byron Hinterland. Well, they’ve done it again. Copperstone, in Bangalow, NSW, is the latest estate to make it into their stable. Set across 48 acres of idyllic countryside, the expansive property, which is predominantly off-grid, takes its inspiration from Tuscan and Argentinian estates. But it’s not just the five-bedroom main house that channels this rustic elegance. The vast collection of recreational facilities across the entire estate, including the games room, pool house, tennis court, stables, dressage area and walled garden also recall a European-meets-Australian spirit. Emma thoughtfully curated the interiors throughout, filling the home with character and hints of ‘luxury from times gone by’. The resulting building reveals a gentle mix of warm, rustic tones of pink, rose, ecru and brown, Ibizan plaster and roughly rendered surfaces. Eye-catching arches feature inside and out and are joined by exposed beams, warm timber details and Emma’s careful pairing of contemporary furniture pieces with vintage finds. But for Emma and Tom, it’s not just the warmth and comfort of the homestead that makes Copperstone so special. It’s the opportunity to really indulge in ‘wellness’. They’ve built a full wellness retreat on the property, with a mineral swimming pool, infrared and hot rock sauna, ice bath, steam room, gym, massage and treatment room, as well as the tennis court, trampoline and dressage arena, there’s every opportunity to relax and enjoy nature. ‘From the moment you enter the gates and drive through the Narnia like forest, across the narrow creek bridge and then arrive at the gorgeous old French gates and beautiful stone pillar walls you feel like you have arrived somewhere special,’ Emma says. ‘The wide, open spaces allow one to feel a true sense of peace and tranquility (and disconnect from the outside world),’ Tom adds. ‘There is nothing more exhilarating than a ride on horseback!’ And, it turns out, there is truly no stopping these two. Now that Copperstone is finished and the Lane family have enjoyed its comforts, Tom and Emma are turning their attention to their next project; Palm Lane. They’ve decided to put Copperstone on the market, ready to transport its next owners to another part of the world. Copperstone is listed for sale with Kim Jones.",
