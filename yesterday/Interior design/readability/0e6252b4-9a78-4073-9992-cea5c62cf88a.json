  "text": "Simplicity meets sophistication in this modern oasis—designed by Artimitro Architects. The understated color palette conveys a sense of calm. But there are interesting accent features (including carefully chosen textures) that make sure is as visually appealing as it gets! We’d like to call this the design secret in the space—where less really is more. The living space and kitchen are tied together with dark wooden flooring. A modular tufted lounge sofa—in opulent black leather—creates a statement in the living area. This is paired with the smart use of texture through the grid-patterned tile on the wall. The kitchen features black leather bar stools next to the island as well as sleek black cabinetry. A punch of blue behind the sink really brings the space to life! The chequered rug sets an interesting base in this bedroom. This is complemented by a simple bed—with a luxurious marble headboard. The minimalist floating nightstands are stunning but also help the room appear more open. Finally, the dark wall behind the bed with a glass partition adds some drama to the space. This bedroom features a minimalist bed frame and a single floating nightstand, which adds a sense of asymmetry. The glass wardrobe adds openness to the room. We also see a modern workstation set up right next to the window—and a huge potted plant! The stand-out feature in this bathroom is the illuminated pedestal sink. The minimalist fixtures and marble flooring keep things sophisticated. We’re huge fans of the textured marble wall panels in this bathroom. They add luxury, sure, but they also have a unique finish. The matte black freestanding tub and built-in basin add some bold color. The tub and vanity are both wall-mounted—freeing up floorspace in this small room.",
