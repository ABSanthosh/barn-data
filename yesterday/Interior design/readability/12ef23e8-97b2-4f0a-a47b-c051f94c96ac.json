All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Whereas the winter holidays once used to feel like the most magical time of year, a bit of that magic inevitably fades as you become an adult. Suddenly you’re the one responsible for making the season seem festive, even though you have tons of gift shopping and home tidying to do before your loved ones arrive. The good thing is, you don’t have to go all out and spend tons of money on decorations to make your home feel Christmas-y. It’s all about the little details, which you can often DIY. One hack that Amazon shoppers are excited about this holiday season are these peppermint-style knob covers, which come in packs of 12. More than 400 packs were bought in the past month, and once you learn how easy the knobs are to apply, you’ll want a pack or two, for your own home! Plus, at $25 for 12 knob covers, they’re hardly expensive as far as holiday decorations go.What are the Peppermint Decorative Knob Covers?It might not seem obvious at first glance, but these brilliant knob covers are a renter-friendly-find you’ll love adding to your holiday decor. Each one is made from plastic and has a stretchy cylinder on the back, so to use, all you have to do is pull it over the existing knob instead — no having to replace your hardware here! The covers are made to fit a variety of knob sizes, ranging from 1 inch to 1 ⅜ inches in diameter. As a result, they can go over most standard-sized knobs; even if your cabinet or drawer has square knobs, you can cover them with these so long as you measure diagonally from corner to corner first and determine that the knobs are the right size. For under $30, you can get a pack of 12 covers, which is probably enough for you to decorate your entire kitchen and maybe even have some leftover for the bathroom or kids’ room.Why You’ll Love the Peppermint Decorative Knob CoversConsidering how quick and easy they are to apply, the peppermint knob covers are one of the most simple holiday decorations you can buy. If you have kids, they’re sure to love these, but you can also just grab some to make your own day-to-day feel a little extra festive. Even better, they seem to work exactly as promised. “The tops are a glossy hard plastic that are a good size, and the silicone bottom is thick enough to not rip but flexible enough to fit snuggly on my knobs that are the maximum width on these,” one Amazon reviewer wrote. “If you have long nails, they might be a challenge, but they held up to me taking them off and on until I had them just perfect. They really add a lot of Christmas charm to my cabinets, and because they are reusable, I can take them off and pack them away until next Christmas.”With 12 covers, you can decorate every room of your home for a cute and cohesive holiday vibe. Anyone who visits is practically guaranteed to notice and comment on them — there’s no way to not feel the holiday spirit when the surrounding space is adorned with this adorable find. With Christmas still a month away, you have plenty of time to grab a pack and display these peppermint knob covers. And next year, you can do it again!Apartment Therapy's Home RunsGet full reviews of editor-favorite finds sent twice a week to your inbox.",
