  "text": "8BitDo is on a roll, launching accessories for the gaming community, and also demonstrating that the industry is on an upward graph when it comes to popularity. The gaming accessories maker is giving every kind of gamer a reason to buy their gamepads. Be it someone who loves playing old-school arcade fighting titles, someone like me who fancies racing games more than anything else, or an indie game lover who is spoilt for choices. The Pro 2 controller released in 2021 was a big hit, and now 8BitDo has released the upgraded version of the popular gamepad. Dubbed Pro 3, the gamepad visually resembles the PlayStation DualSense controller design. There are side-by-side sticks that now have drift-resistant TMR technology. This is the brand’s first-ever controller with easy swappable ABXY buttons. In a market flooded with good gaming controllers at reasonable prices, having one that is compatible with multiple platforms is a big plus. The 8BitDo Pro 3 fairs good in that regard with Switch 2, Windows PC, Apple, Android, and SteamOS compatibility. Designer: 8BitDo The TMR joysticks and triggers have Hall effect or the non-linear micro-switch mode for maximum precision while gaming. The gamepad with Bluetooth and wired connectivity option comes with extra bumpers, dual Pro paddle buttons on the back, and swappable magnetic ABXY buttons to play any type of gaming titles with no major handicaps. To bleed in the arcade element even more, the controller comes with a pair of ball-top joystick caps. Another USP of the gaming accessory is its retro-styled charging dock, which makes it convenient to charge the controller for gamers who don’t want to go through the hassle of plugging in cables for charging. It also doubles as a storage dock for the 2.5 GHz dongle. The optional joystick module will make the controller ideal for playing fighting games and other retro titles. Also, the 6-axis gyroscope will make it well-suited for FPS titles and racing games where gamers love the freedom of movement with directional changes. The Pro 2 carried a price tag of $50 when it launched, but the new Pro 3 has a price tag of $70 which is a bit steep but justified. That’s because the gamepad comes with a 1,000mAh rechargeable battery, which takes the total gameplay time to 20 hours on a single charge. 8BitDo Pro 3 in three color options can be pre-ordered right now and will go on sale on August 12th. These color options each match the retro vibe of the respective consoles: G classic resembling the Game Boy, gray reviving memories of the PlayStation, and purple reminiscent of the GameCube.",
