  "description": "This Bronte house, built in the early 1900s, had been through several unsympathetic updates before the owners engaged Revel Design for a renovation. In addition to reconfiguring the interiors to meet the needs of busy family life, this latest redesign injects subtle pops of peach and blue to create a clean, playful, and modern home designed for entertaining.",

  "text": "The redesign of this 1900s Bronte house all started with the client’s favourite throw rug. It was a piece from Sage and Clare that they’d owned for years and ‘felt embodied their vibe,’ according to Revel Design interior designer Claire Richardson. The throw featured a harmonious balance of pink and blue tones that the owners wanted to bring into this new iteration of their family home, which had suffered a series of unsympathetic updates over the years. ‘A big part of the project was restoring the home’s character, adding colour and making it more functional for a busy family,’ Revel Design architect Kat Prowse adds. The existing pokey ground floor was opened up to create a singular space for entertaining. It had to be somewhere relaxed enough for the owner’s three young children could hang out in after school, but that could also easily host an adult dinner party. A mud room was a must have to ensure the living room could appear sophisticated, hiding the mess of everyday life. The palette of pinks and coastal-inspired blues comes through in a myriad of subtle but striking elements. Textured blue tiles on the kitchen splashback and the pastel double bullnose edge of the island bench is echoed in the curved, tiled fireplace. ‘The first level rooms were efficiently laid out around the new central staircase and landing, providing direct access to three spacious kids bedrooms and a large family bathroom,’ Kat says. They opted for a bold peach-coloured sink and feature walls in the bathroom, which matches the bright front door. ‘We took design inspiration from some of the really sweet existing details in the home, including the triangular “hats” that were the existing architraves over the internal doors,’  Kat says. ‘This angled “hat” architrave also drove the design of the external balcony fretwork.’ Other sentimental accents include the dimmable shell sconces in the living room from Black Salt Co, and the main bedroom’s chic wallpaper that looks like a hand-painted abstract artwork. The resulting house nails the owner’s brief of being equal parts family-friendly, luxurious, and robust enough to withstand life by the beach!",
