  "text": "Welcome to Fox Home, designed by Yara Lysiuk. Much like its namesake, this home is subtle yet striking, with design choices that feel intentional, warm… and just a little bit wild. Neutral tones, tactile materials, and sculptural forms come together in a space that feels grounded yet elevated. Let’s walk through the Fox Home to learn its design secrets. The living area at Fox Home is the heart of calm sophistication. Wrapped in soft neutrals and flooded with natural light, the space feels like a deep breath. A plush, low-profile sectional anchors the room. Pale wood tones echo throughout—from the round coffee table to the sleek media console. A sculptural lamp and thoughtfully placed ceramics add just enough contrast, as does the black accent chair. At the center of the kitchen sits a striking island. Its black frame and brushed steel base create bold contrast against the pale wood cabinetry that lines the back wall. Minimalist bar stools echo the sleek aesthetic, while the sculptural dried branch centerpiece brings a raw element into the space. Everything is streamlined and handle-free, yet nothing feels sterile. This room at Fox Home is designed as a serene workspace as well as creative retreat. It features a beautifully grained wood desk. The standout piece? A sculptural, textured chair in a soft powder blue—a quiet yet confident accent against the otherwise neutral palette. Soft daylight pours through sheer curtains, diffusing gently across the matte walls and highlighting the minimal, functional floor lamp. With zero clutter and maximum intention, this room is a gentle invitation to pause, think, and create. The bedrooms at Fox Home are havens of hush and harmony. Every detail whispers tranquility, from the crisp white linens to the earthy-toned throws. Rounded architectural cutouts frame views from one space to the next, creating a gentle rhythm of connection. Nightstands are sculptural yet subtle, whether it’s a mirrored piece topped with a single bloom or a charred wood block. Lighting is kept soft and indirect, letting natural textures and shadows take the spotlight. The bathrooms at Fox Home continue the home’s quiet elegance. Walls and floors blend seamlessly. Fixtures are modern and minimal—matte finishes, sculptural taps, and hidden storage keep the space uncluttered. Curated touches, like a single branch in a ceramic vase or a neatly folded towel, bring in a layer of softness.",
