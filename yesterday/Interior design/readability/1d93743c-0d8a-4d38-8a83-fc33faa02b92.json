Known for its bold, spiky bark and whimsical character, the geometry of the Ceiba tree informs the playful, cartoon-like design of the pieces.The CEIBA series encompasses two shelves, a table, and four chairs, all designed to be arranged like a cohesive, spiky bush. Channeling the unexpected forms of nature, Bierens de Haan imbues the collection with a touch of humor and vibrancy. The pieces are available in three distinct finishes: natural oak, green oak, and black oak.all images ©Dylan PerrenoudSOMBRA ceramics series complements the furniture collectionAs part of the exhibition, Geneva-based Giona Bierens de Haan partnered with Swiss-Argentinian ceramist Ángeles Rodríguez to create a complementary ceramic collection titled SOMBRA. Crafted from black sandstone, the pieces engage in dialogue with one of the CEIBA shelves. Together, the collections celebrate a shared exploration of materiality, form, and the unexpected connections found in nature. The CEIBA pieces are available upon request, inviting admirers to bring their spiky charm into their own spaces.architect and designer Giona Bierens de Haan unveils CEIBAceramist Ángeles Rodríguez creates a complementary ceramic collection titled SOMBRACEIBA mesa and CEIBA bicho, green oak",
