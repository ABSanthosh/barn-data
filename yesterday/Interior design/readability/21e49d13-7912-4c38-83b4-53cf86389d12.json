  "text": "The climate and colours of the New England coast influenced the interiors of this hotel in Portland, Maine, designed by New York-based studio Post Company. The Longfellow Hotel occupies a new building in the city's West End neighbourhood, a short distance from the historic Old Port area. In the lobby of The Longfellow Hotel, turmeric-coloured sofas contrast the pale seafoam-green wallsNamed after local poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, the 48-room boutique hotel is operated by Maine-based Uncommon Hospitality. \"Much like the famed poet's enduring words, the hotel reflects the location's rugged charm and extremes of the environment – from cold, blustery winters to sun-soaked summer months,\" said the hotel team. The 48 guest rooms blend traditional mouldings and contemporary furnitureThe ground-floor lobby space features soaring ceilings elongated by tall windows, rail and stile wall panelling, and a series of minimal brass chandeliers. To one side of the entrance, a lounge area is formed by turmeric-coloured modular sofas that contrast the pale seafoam-green walls and black-and-white penny round flooring. Elements like black wooden furniture and dark light fixtures contrast the off-white paintwork. Photo by Chris MottaliniOn the other is an open space where a large wooden dining table, various patterned seating options and small accent tables offer spots for guests to work or relax. The hotel's bar – named Five of Clubs – is located at the far end, backed by a huge mirror and surrounded by vintage artwork. Some of the rooms feature cosy workspace nooks\"The interiors feel familiar, yet impart a true sense of place, by blending contemporary elements with traditional touches to evoke a modern timelessness,\" said Post Company partner Jou-Yie Chou. \"The design establishes a sequence of spaces that invite visitors in, while handsome details encourage them to linger and indulge.\" Contrasting black and white decor continues in the bathroomsBeyond the bar is the small Twinflower Cafe that serves coffee, pastries and a selection of breakfast dishes. A separate yet connected entrance leads to the hotel's Astraea spa, which was minimally designed with local granite surfaces, textured limewash walls and natural wood flooring. All of the rooms are outfitted with wide-plank oak flooring. Photo by Chris MottaliniThe guest rooms are spread across the upper floors and blend traditional and contemporary design elements. All are outfitted with wide-plank oak floors accented with monochromatic trim, crown and baseboard mouldings. Black doors, closet pulls, light fixtures and furniture pieces like tables and chairs juxtapose the off-white paintwork. Meanwhile, custom headboards with scalloped tops and TRNK-designed chaise lounges were upholstered in jewel-toned velvet for added contrast. On the top floor is a communal lounge space for quiet activitiesAlso on the top floor is a communal lounge room for reading, working, board games and other low-key activities. Hotel guests can take advantage of complimentary bicycle rentals and an electric car service. These are among a number of eco-conscious efforts made by the property, which also include zero single-use plastics and all-electric appliances. The hotel's Astraea spa is minimally designed with Scandinavian influencesFormerly known as Studio Tack, Post Company has completed a variety of hotels across the US over the past few years: from a historic property in Carmel-by-the-Sea to a boutique spot in Aspen that's decorated with earthy hues. The latter, named Mollie Aspen, was shortlisted in the hotel and short-stay interior category of Dezeen Awards 2024. The photography is by Carley Rudd unless stated otherwise.
