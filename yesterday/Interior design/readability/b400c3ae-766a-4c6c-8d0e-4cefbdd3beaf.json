I was constantly tidying, decluttering, cleaning—always trying to keep up. I’d reset one room… while another unraveled. Declutter. Organize. Clean. Repeat. And even when things felt calm for a day or two, the chaos always crept back in. I started to grow tired of trying so hard to keep up! So I started to wonder: Maybe I’m just not good at this. Maybe I was failing at this whole “home” thing. For a long time, I believed peace would only come with MORE—more time, more money, more effort. I thought a sense of calm could only arrive once everything was FINISHED. But the truth? Peace didn’t come from doing it all. Or from getting it all right. It came from doing what mattered—on purpose, in rhythm. My home became a sanctuary not because I did more or got it all done, but because I embraced small, soulful rhythms. Tiny acts of care brought peace to our space—and to me, too. If your home ever feels more like a source of overwhelm than peace—you’re not alone. You’re a HomeBody.You crave a home that nurtures you.A space that reflects you.A rhythm that inspires you.  HomeBodies love HomeBody Gathering Place because we do things differently.
