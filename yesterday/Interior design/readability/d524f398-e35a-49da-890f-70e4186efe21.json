Examples include projects that incorporate the use of artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), blockchain technologies, robotics, biometrics, advanced materials, or new production processes.Hussain Almossawi has spent his career testing the boundaries of possibility. As the Design Director of Mossawi Studios (which he founded in 2019), Hussain devotes himself to exploring \"the limitless potential of design to create impactful change, driven by our imagination and insights.\" Prior to founding his multi-disciplinary design studio, the industrial designer, visual effects artist, and bestselling author built a portfolio of clients ranging from Nike, Apple, and Adidas to Intel and Ford Motor Company. He enjoys \"blurring the lines between product design and CGI\" and designing futuristic experiences, and this creative, forward-thinking mindset has made Hussain a sought-after keynote speaker and teacher on innovation and design. Hussain describes design as the place \"where the worlds of imagination and science converge, enabling us to transform creative visions into practical solutions.\" He finds discovery and growth in all aspects of the design journey, from exploring ideas to prototyping and refining solutions. Throughout, Hussain balances the desire to \"dream big\" with the practical need to solve \"real-world\" problems. As he describes it: \"Each step, from the initial concept to the final design, reflects the balance of creativity and logic. It's fulfilling to see how thoughtful design can shape meaningful outcomes and push the boundaries of what's possible.\"If Hussain holds any concerns about the state of the design industry, they center on designers' tendency to \"play it safe.\" This tentative approach, in his opinion, leads to \"the oversaturation and repetitiveness of identical ideas, where there's a reluctance to push boundaries or rethink what already exists.\" Hussain believes that a designer who hesitates to move beyond the status quo limits their opportunities for creativity and \"meaningful progress.\" As he explains, \"True innovation requires a willingness to improve, adapt, and take even small steps toward reimagining what's possible, yet too often, opportunities to elevate designs are overlooked in favor of familiarity.\"Hussain's advice to Core77 Design Awards entrants? \"Embrace failure as an essential part of the journey and focus on enjoying the process.\" In his experience, approaching setbacks as valuable learning opportunities can ultimately lead to breakthroughs. He also encourages designers to keep the experience fun and engaging. \"[That] will breathe life into your project, fueling your creativity and keeping you fully invested. When you approach challenges with enthusiasm and a willingness to grow, your passion and dedication will shine through in the final outcome, making your project stand out.\"2024 Core77 Design Awards Emerging Technologies winner Elroy Air for the Elroy Air Chaparral.The 2024 winner in the Core77 Design Awards Emerging Technologies category was Elroy Air for the Elroy Air Chaparral, an autonomous vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft capable of delivering 300 pounds of cargo across a 300-mile range.
