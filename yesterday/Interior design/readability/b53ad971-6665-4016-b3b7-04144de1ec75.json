  "description": "This WP200Pro 5G, by Chinese manufacturer Oukitel, is a ruggedized smartphone. The company says the shockproof casing, aluminum frame, impact-resistant glass and reinforced rubber can take a beating, and it's both water- and dust-resistant. It also has a rather bizarre design feature. On the back of the phone is a small additional screen that can display notifications. This screen can be popped out and placed into a wristwatch accessory, and connects to your phone via Bluetooth. And, get this, the screen has an earbud on the back of it, and can be popped into your ear.They've done a real bang-up Photoshop job showing this \"Multifunctional Bluetooth Earphone\" in use. It will be interesting to see if this feature actually proves useful and catches on. We'll have to wait for the phone to be released; at press time Oukitel hadn't announced a price nor delivery date.",
