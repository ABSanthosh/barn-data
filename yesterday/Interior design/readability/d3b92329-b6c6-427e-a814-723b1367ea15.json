  "description": "Designed in Austria, this stainless steel device is the Nuki Smart Lock. Since the company's formation a decade ago, they've shipped over 800,000 units—in Europe. Today the company is finally entering the U.S. market. The company says it can be easily retrofitted without needing to drill anything. Once installed, you can unlock your door via smartphone app—hands-free; the company's app detects your proximity to the lock via Bluetooth and pops it as you approach. An internal brushless motor unlocks in 1.5 seconds, which sounds slow to me, but the company says it's faster than competing products. Potenial UX hassle: The lock is powered by an internal lithium polymer batter, and while it will hold a charge for months (according to the company), you will need to periodically charge it. On the bottom of the knob is a little magnetic connection point that you attached the charging cable to. It takes two hours to top it up. The Nuki Smart Lock runs $160, and should be available on Amazon by the time you read this.",
