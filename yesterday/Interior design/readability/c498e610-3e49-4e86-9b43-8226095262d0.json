It’s easy to make mistakes like choosing the wrong pattern, applying it incorrectly, or simply feeling overwhelmed by the options, but when used well, wallpaper can transform a space like nothing else. Experts agree that it’s not just about picking a pretty print, it’s about balance, function, and the right application. Whether you want a bold statement wall or a subtle texture that catches the light, there’s a way to make wallpaper work for you. Here’s what the pros say about using it successfully. Use It to Define Spaces Open-concept layouts can feel too vast without clear separation between spaces, and wallpaper is a great way to mark that separation. A bold print behind a dining table creates a natural division from the living room without needing walls or dividers. In a studio apartment, wallpaper can section off a sleeping area. Even in larger homes, using different wallpapers in different areas can create distinct zones with their own personality. Experts recommend keeping a thread of consistency between these spaces, like a repeated color, to make transitions feel smooth rather than sudden. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / pro_creator Small Spaces Can Handle Big Prints Many people avoid large-patterned wallpaper in small rooms, fearing it will make the space feel smaller, but experts say the opposite is more often true. A big and bold print in a tiny bedroom or a narrow hallway can actually make the space feel more expansive. Picking a pattern with some movement to it, like waves or vines, can also help here. It creates depth in a way that plain paint often can’t. The key, though, is to embrace the impact rather than shy away from it. Make it the focal point, center your decor around it and let it be the defining feature. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / pro_creator Balance Wallpaper With the Right Decor To that point actually, one common mistake people make is treating wallpaper as just another background element when, in reality, it’s a major part of the decor. Experts advise styling a room around the wallpaper rather than treating it as an afterthought. If the pattern is busy, keep furniture and accessories simple, and if the wallpaper is more subtle, use bolder decor. The right balance keeps a room from feeling either chaotic or underwhelming.

Today’s peel-and-stick options can be surprisingly high-end, with rich textures and designs that rival traditional wallpaper. It’s also ideal for those who like to change their decor frequently. Since it’s easier to apply and remove, it allows for experimentation without long-term commitment. Even professionals use it for testing out patterns before committing to permanent wallpaper. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / hiv360 Consider Texture When people think of wallpaper, they often focus only on pattern and color, but texture is just as important. Grasscloth, embossed designs, and even fabric wallpapers add a richness that paint simply can’t achieve. Experts say textured wallpaper works especially well in neutral tones, as it brings some visual interest without overwhelming a space. It helps uplift spaces that feel flat or cold, adding that extra little something that brings a simple room to the next level. Thick and/or fabric wallpapers are also great for softening a room’s acoustics. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / LeylaCamomile Pay Attention to Scale One of the biggest mistakes people make with wallpaper is ignoring scale. A pattern that looks great in a sample might feel too busy when covering an entire wall. Experts recommend stepping back and considering how a design will look from different angles and distances. Larger patterns can be more flexible (as mentioned earlier), small patterns work best on small sections of wall, anything too big and you’ll just feel overwhelmed by it. Though, contrast matters here too. A small print with lower contrast could work in a large space as the patterning itself will be more subtle. This step requires some experimentation, so don’t be afraid to take your time and test everything you want to see! Photo Credit: Envato Elements / Rawpixel Wallpaper is best regarded as a design tool, not just decoration. The key with it is to be intentional with your choices. Whether you go bold or subtle, textured or smooth, the right wallpaper can make a space feel more like home and open up tons of design opportunities you might never have considered before.

Thick and/or fabric wallpapers are also great for softening a room’s acoustics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_266846\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-266846\"\u003e            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/a-bed-with-pillows-and-christmas-decorations-in-th-2023-11-27-05-34-01-utc-86714-scaled.jpg?width=480\" media=\"(max-width: 481px)\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1709\"/\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/a-bed-with-pillows-and-christmas-decorations-in-th-2023-11-27-05-34-01-utc-86714-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"A bed with pillows and Christmas decorations in the bedroom in a Scandinavian style.\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1709\" srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/a-bed-with-pillows-and-christmas-decorations-in-th-2023-11-27-05-34-01-utc-86714-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/a-bed-with-pillows-and-christmas-decorations-in-th-2023-11-27-05-34-01-utc-86714-270x180.jpg 270w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/a-bed-with-pillows-and-christmas-decorations-in-th-2023-11-27-05-34-01-utc-86714-921x615.jpg 921w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/a-bed-with-pillows-and-christmas-decorations-in-th-2023-11-27-05-34-01-utc-86714-768x513.jpg 768w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/a-bed-with-pillows-and-christmas-decorations-in-th-2023-11-27-05-34-01-utc-86714-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/a-bed-with-pillows-and-christmas-decorations-in-th-2023-11-27-05-34-01-utc-86714-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/a-bed-with-pillows-and-christmas-decorations-in-th-2023-11-27-05-34-01-utc-86714-385x257.jpg 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"/\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\n                \n                \n            \u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-266846\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://elements.envato.com/a-bed-with-pillows-and-christmas-decorations-in-th-3WS9MHM\"\u003ePhoto Credit: Envato Elements / LeylaCamomile\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003ePay Attention to Scale\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the biggest mistakes people make with wallpaper is ignoring scale. A pattern that looks great in a sample might feel too busy when covering an \u003ca href=\"https://www.decoist.com/wallpaper-accent-walls-bedroom/\"\u003eentire wall.\u003c/a\u003e Experts recommend stepping back and considering how a design will look from different angles and distances. Larger patterns can be more flexible (as mentioned earlier), small patterns work best on small sections of wall, anything too big and you’ll just feel overwhelmed by it. Though, contrast matters here too. A small print with lower contrast \u003cem\u003ecould \u003c/em\u003ework in a large space as the patterning itself will be more subtle. This step requires some experimentation, so don’t be afraid to take your time and test everything you want to see!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_266851\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-266851\"\u003e            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modern-living-room-interior-design-2025-02-10-00-18-24-utc-min-48230-scaled.jpg?width=480\" media=\"(max-width: 481px)\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\"/\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modern-living-room-interior-design-2025-02-10-00-18-24-utc-min-48230-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"A section of a living room, zooming in on a chair and dresser with accessories, a large print leafy wallpaper behind.\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modern-living-room-interior-design-2025-02-10-00-18-24-utc-min-48230-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modern-living-room-interior-design-2025-02-10-00-18-24-utc-min-48230-270x180.jpg 270w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modern-living-room-interior-design-2025-02-10-00-18-24-utc-min-48230-922x615.jpg 922w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modern-living-room-interior-design-2025-02-10-00-18-24-utc-min-48230-768x513.jpg 768w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modern-living-room-interior-design-2025-02-10-00-18-24-utc-min-48230-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modern-living-room-interior-design-2025-02-10-00-18-24-utc-min-48230-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modern-living-room-interior-design-2025-02-10-00-18-24-utc-min-48230-385x257.jpg 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"/\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\n                \n                \n            \u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-266851\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://elements.envato.com/modern-living-room-interior-design-XGEK483\"\u003ePhoto Credit: Envato Elements / Rawpixel\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWallpaper is best regarded as a design tool, not just decoration.
