  "description": "Pol McMahon, aka Pol the Painter, is Fitzroy’s unofficial documentarian, historian, and passionate storyteller. For more than 30 years, the self-taught artist has chronicled Melbourne’s oldest suburb through his observational artworks, usually created in Pol’s apartment — located in the Atherton Gardens public housing estate — or en plein air on the streets below.
