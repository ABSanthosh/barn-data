Measuring 25 ft (7.6 m) in length, it features an interior layout optimized for full-time living, as well as use as a guest house or vacation retreat. Built on a double-axle gooseneck trailer, this tiny house is easier to tow compared to standard bumper-pull trailers, making it ideal for those who enjoy frequent travel. The exterior is finished with engineered wood and topped with a metal roof, combining durability with aesthetic appeal. Designer: Tiny House Listings The home welcomes visitors through elegant double glass doors, which are sheltered by a quaint porch area, perfect for taking a moment to enjoy the outdoors before stepping inside. Upon entering, guests find themselves in the cozy living room, thoughtfully designed to maximize space and comfort. This area features a custom-built sofa, perfectly tailored to fit the room’s dimensions, providing a comfortable spot for relaxation or entertaining. An entertainment center has been strategically placed to offer easy access to media and storage. Adjacent to the living room is the well-equipped kitchen. The kitchen boasts sleek quartz countertops that offer ample space for meal preparation, complemented by a generous amount of cabinetry to store kitchen essentials neatly. It is equipped with modern appliances, including a refrigerator, a sink, and a four-burner stove powered by propane. There is also designated space for installing an oven and additional appliances. This thoughtfully designed kitchen serves as the central hub of the home. The bathroom in this model is conveniently accessed directly from the kitchen, offering a compact yet functional design. Although the bathroom appears relatively small, it includes essential amenities such as a shower and a flushing toilet. While the firm doesn’t specifically mention a sink, we can assume that a compact sink is integrated into the layout. This setup ensures that even in a smaller footprint, the bathroom provides the necessary facilities for daily use. The tiny house features a single bedroom located in the raised gooseneck section of the trailer, positioned at the opposite end of the home from the entrance. The bedroom seems just large enough to accommodate a double bed, offering a cozy retreat for rest. This tiny home, unlike typical ones, features a slightly higher ceiling, which offers more space and enhances comfort. The elevated design optimizes space and also adds a unique architectural detail to the home. This model is currently available for purchase at US$65,000, making it an affordable option in today’s tiny house market. Tiny House Listings has been quite active recently, having completed several projects, including a duplex tiny house and an extra-wide model reminiscent of an apartment.",
