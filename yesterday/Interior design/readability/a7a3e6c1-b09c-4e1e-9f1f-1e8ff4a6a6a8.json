  "text": "Thanks for stopping by for this week’s Style Scouting. My Sunday post where I share the random stuff that captured my attention or inspired me that I found online. And here we are… the unofficial start of summer – Memorial Day. Yesterday my twin sister and her family came to our house to enjoy a beautiful day spent outside. It was a perfect weather day. The guys kayaked and then floated in the lake with margaritas in hand. My sis and I sat on the dock, also with drinks while our feet dangled in the water as we felt the water was still a bit too chilly to go all in. The rest of the weekend forecast is calling for rain and so I am happy that we had a day filled with sunshine and getting to simply hang out together. I hope your weekend ahead is filled with family, sunshine, relaxation and a moment or two of reflection, remembrance, to honor the service and sacrifice of those who died while serving in the U.S. military.
