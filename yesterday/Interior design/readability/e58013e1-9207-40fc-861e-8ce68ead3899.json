  "text": "Waxed plaster walls, rainbow onyx surfaces and an olive tree create a spa-like atmosphere inside the store that Canadian studio Ste Marie has designed for luggage brand Monos. The new Monos location is situated on Ossington Street, a few blocks away from Toronto's Little Portugal neighbourhood. An olive tree sits in front of a vertical light box at the heart of the Monos store in TorontoThe brand draws influence from the Japanese concept of \"mono no aware\" – an appreciation of fleeting moments of beauty – and Ste Marie used this to guide the interior design. \"The space invites guests to embark on a multi-sensory journey that connects them to moments of awe, discovery and the joy we crave with travel,\" said the studio, which has offices in Toronto and Vancouver. The store's minimalist design includes serene beige tones and stone display shelvesPortuguese bed and breakfasts known as \"pousadas\" also provided a reference for the welcoming ambiance that the team aimed to achieve. \"This dreamlike space on Ossington, influenced by gentle surrealism and the cultural hospitality of Portugal's pousadas, is timeless and wistful,\" said Ste Marie. Through the centre of the space, a water feature flows from the rainbow onyx counter and cascades into a lower basinAn olive tree stands at the heart of the store, against a light box that rises up the wall behind and traces across the ceiling. On either side, waxed plaster walls and monoliths of split-faced cottonwood limestone help to frame the central installation. The brand draws influence from the Japanese concept of \"mono no aware\" – an appreciation of fleeting moments of beautyA larger central counter is topped with a slab of Turkish rainbow onyx, patterned with veins of blue-grey and orange. From the countertop, a raised water feature flows towards the front of the store and cascades into a lower basin, \"cuing the simplicity and connection between nature and humanity\" according to Ste Marie. The beige colour scheme extends from the ceiling to the flooring and across wall displays and lighting elements Cove lighting illuminates the large stone shelves upon which the luggage products are presented against the neutral backdrop. Cove lighting illuminates the display shelves along the walls\"Softly encased wall niches, adorned with subtle Italian Onice Striato Avorio stone, showcase the brand's curated collection of luggage and accessories –thoughtful products for the mindful traveler,\" Ste Marie said. Back-of-house areas are concealed by taupe curtains, while full-length mirrors installed in the corners allow the space to feel larger than it is. The store is located on Ossington Street, close to the city's Little Portugal neighbourhoodSte Marie is best known for its hospitality interiors across Vancouver, with recent projects including a restaurant influenced by Hong Kong's \"love motels\" and a bakery decorated in malty hues. The studio's previous forays into retail have included a lifestyle store that spotlights the art of flower arranging. The photography is by Doublespace.
