This earthy and warm version of coastal style is something we see reflected in many of our favourite home tours in our archive — regardless of their location. In fact, you can bring a taste of this beachy vibe to any space with the right pieces. One way to do so is simply by playing with varying natural textures. This might be through your interior fixtures, such as installing sun-kissed-looking timbers, like the White Smoked Oak Floorboards by Royal Oak Flooring or using Laminex’s Raw Birchply on the joinery. Timber-lined walls also immediately fill a room with calming energy, evoking memories of retro holiday homes. But if you prefer a light-and-bright backdrop, a woven jute rug like Sequoia by Armadillo is a more subtle way to inject texture into a room with crisp white walls. Woven furniture and rattan accents are other classic coastal-look staples that can easily add plenty of rich, lived-in character without having to tackle any renovation. In the living room, we can’t go past the Thonet’s No.811 Hoffmann chair, which pairs a sophisticated bentwood frame with a hand-woven cane seat, or the statement curves of the Gubi Grace Easy Chair from Cult. Vintage-inspired rattan lamps are also really having a moment. We love how the soft linen lamp shade of La Bobine Table Lamp by ELLISON STUDIOS. complements with the eye-catching base.
