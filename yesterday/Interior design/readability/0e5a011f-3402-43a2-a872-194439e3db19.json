  "text": "FULL BODY CERAMICS DESIGNED FOR PERFORMANCE AND VERSATILITYAs a significant evolution in ceramic technology, Ariostea’s Full Body³ slabs are created from a mix of natural granules and flakes, running through their entire thickness which ensures visual consistency and uniform performance from the outermost layer to the very core. A brand of the Iris Ceramica Group, Ariostea combines this material depth with advanced production to support a wide range of architectural applications — from walls and floors to countertops and custom furnishings. With resistance to acids, fire, water, and abrasion — and a non-toxic, non-absorbent composition — the slabs meet technical demands without compromising design quality.Ariostea’s Full Body³ slabs ensure material integrity throughout the entire thickness | all images courtesy of AriosteaTHE RESULT OF THIRTY YEARS OF MATERIAL DEVELOPMENT AT ARIOSTEA  The Full Body³ technology is the product of over thirty years of material development at Ariostea, where ceramics are not treated as flat decoration but as long-term building components. Known for its technical expertise and aesthetic sensibility, the Italian brand continues to challenge conventions with high-performance porcelain that reflects the nuances of natural stone. Full Body³ is a testament to this expertise – a masterful blend of advanced technology, artisanal precision, and an industrial production process protected by international patents.each slab is formed from compressed natural minerals, creating a dense and uniform structureTHREE PROJECTS, ONE CORE TECHNOLOGYPressed at extremely high pressure and vitrified at 1300°C, each slab produced with Ariostea’s Full Body³ technology is one of a kind. The material transcends its role as a mere finish layer, instead embracing the full characteristics of an architectural component: inherently resistant, dimensionally stable, and tactile. Its durability is underpinned by a responsible production process, prioritizing the use of safe materials and sustainable methods. Full Body³ delivers on functional demands, presenting as a non-absorbent, acid- and fire-resistant, sanitizable surface, free from harmful substances. The Full Body³ system underpins three distinct projects, each characterized by its own stylistic language but unified through the same technical core. Elementae refers back to geological origins, inspired by the tones and textures of Portuguese stone. The palette ranges from Lumen — a bright ivory — to the warmer Tellus brown. Available finishes include Natural Plus, Flamed, and Structured, as well as the Stilo decoration. In its 20 mm-thick CM2 Outdoor version, Elementae becomes suitable for terraces, public plazas, and garden installations — enabling material continuity between indoor and outdoor applications.Full Body³ ceramics can be worked on the edges, opening up detailing options for architects and designersAccademia looks to the Venetian terrazzo tradition, reinterpreted through Ariostea’s high-tech processes.

It is intrinsically safe, clean, and fireproof – impervious to acids, effortlessly cleaned, inherently fire-resistant, and rigorously guaranteed to never release harmful substances.
