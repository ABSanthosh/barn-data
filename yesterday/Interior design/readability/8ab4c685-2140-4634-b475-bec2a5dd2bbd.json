Our team is perpetually on the hunt for hot homewares, and this month we’re coveting everything from striped bedlinen, to moody lamps, and even a new coffee machine that’ll make enduring the cold months that much easier. Find all everything that’s currently on our wish lists below! WrittenbyChristina KarrasLucy Feagins, Editor What homewares are you currently on the hunt for and why? I’ve been looking for a table lamp to bring a little more of a cosy atmosphere to my living room. I’m liking the Sahara 1 Rattan Table Lamp from Beacon Lighting — and honestly, I am shocked at how reasonable the price is! What are some of the standout products on your wishlist right now? I’ve also been a fan of Alex and Trahanas’ ceramics for a long time, and the cute inverted triangular shape of the Lido Ceramic Serving Bowl feels like one of those pieces that’s simple and small enough for everyday use, not just special occasions. Plus, I love everything BAINA does, including the new-ish Fuyu and Chalk range — the warm nutmeg and creamy tones are perfect together. Bea Taylor, Managing Editor What homewares are you currently on the hunt for and why? I love to cook and host dinners, so anything kitchen-related is always on my list! Lamps also hold a permanent spot, simply because I belong to the ‘no overhead lights club’ and love a soft glow — the more the merrier! What are some of the standout products on your wishlist right now? I ADORE Sophie Lou Jacobsen’s Cosmo Coupes, they’re so intricate and beautiful — like drinking from a delicate flower. Similarly sweet is Citta’s Wyatt Cushion Cover. The colours are gentle, the pattern is subtle, and it’s made from 100 per cent recycled silk yarn, so soft! Sarah Hendriks, Art Director What homewares are you currently on the hunt for and why? For the first time, I’m not living in a share house anymore, so I’m wanting to create a space that feels a little more grown up. And after being inside many, many homes across Australia on shoots for TDF, I have learnt that it’s all the little things that make a home feel special. What are some of the standout products on your wishlist right now? I have been DYING to get a bolster cushion like this one from In Bed. Maybe it’s the association with my weekly yoga class, but the shape is great and think they can add a lot to a bed without being too ‘cushiony’. I’m also obsessed with anything Florian Home and as someone who loves to cook and host, I’m loving the Ichendorf Milano Wine Glasses for a little bit of a retro dinner party vibe. Amelia Barnes, Senior Writer What homewares are you currently on the hunt for and why?  Right at the top of my homewares wishlist are some new sofa cushions. They’re a bit of an investment, but I’d love something a bit special like the cushion covers from Sundance Studio that are handwoven with wool on a floor loom. What are some of the standout products on your wishlist right now? I have a thing for coasters, and Theo Coasters by McMullin have really caught my eye! I think the slightly childlike star shape is very sweet. I also love little artworks that can be moved around the house. Small ceramics like the Ceramic Postcards by Capucine Pageron from Pepite can be simply blu-tacked or stuck with double sided tape to a kitchen splashback to create a little, unique focal point in the home. Christina Karras, Writer and Producer What homewares are you currently on the hunt for and why? Winter is my absolute least favourite time of year and I’m not much of a homebody by choice, so I’m looking for anything that will make me feel a little bit better about slowing down and staying in. What are some of the standout products on your wishlist right now? I’ve had my eye on the Mahogany Royal Stripe Duvet Cover from Deiji Studios ever since I saw it styled with the brand’s musk-coloured pillowcases — the brown and pink combination is so cute; it reminds me of Neapolitan ice cream. Plus, the adorable striped Pj Mug by Byron Bay ceramicist Jedda looks like exactly what I need for my afternoon hot chocolate treat. And because lighting a candle is always calming, I’m loving the fresh-yet-earthy scent of the Malin Goetz Otto Candle from Mecca! Georgie Rose, Account Manager What homewares are you currently on the hunt for and why? My housemates and I moved into some new digs two days ago (which is exciting!) but now I can’t stop thinking about all the homewares I want to buy. I’m pretty much in the market for everything! What are some of the standout products on your wishlist right now? There are three items that are patiently waiting in my cart: the Akari 3X lantern, the Pool Towel Set 03 from Baina, and the Service Tray Set from Saloon Store. These have all been on my wishlist for a while, but if I had to choose one, I think the Akari lantern takes the cake. It’d be perfect in our living room! Chelsea Hall, Advertising and Sponsorship Manager What homewares are you currently on the hunt for and why? This time of the year is all about snuggling on the sofa with the kids to watch a movie, popcorn in hand. The Schoolhouse Pendleton Canebrake blanket looks perfect to keep us warm this winter — and anything with green tones gets a big tick in our family! What are some of the standout products on your wishlist right now? I’ve been a big fan of Lucy Tolan’s work for a long time, I love the organic shapes of her vessels, like this beautiful textured Tile Vessel in Biscuit. Storage is essential for keeping kid’s things tidy at our house, so the HAY Tool Box looks perfect for organising pens and pencils, and the Cork Tray from Capra Designs makes a cute catch-all for the various little bits and pieces they collect! Alice Ziebell, Partnerships Manager What homewares are you currently on the hunt for and why? I’ve been spending a lot of time cosied up by the fire now that the chilly weather has set in, so any little objects we can bring into the space to make it more beautiful or homely, I am here for! I think something like a bright pop of red from the tomato red Serving Bowl by Softedge Studio would help lift the spirits even on the chilliest of days. What are some of the standout products on your wishlist right now? My little girl is getting older now and I’m feeling inspired to set her up her own proper bedroom filled with cute and charming things for her to play with. The Mushroom Storage Basket by Olli Ella is both of those things and I know she would love it! And of course, my son can’t go without so a bedroom refresh with a new Remi Linen Quilt Cover in from Sage and Clare would give his room a grown-up facelift! The Cabin Linen Cushion Cover by Citta would be perfect to snuggle into on one of my many evenings spent knitting by the fire — I might never want to leave the couch! Lisa Nelson, Designer What homewares are you currently on the hunt for and why? Because I’m currently living in a share house, I’m focused on finding smaller and more accessible homewares, like scones, vases and little sugar bowls. Additionally, I’m always on the hunt for more practical homewares, such as shopping bags and cookbooks — things that can make everyday chores more fun! What are some of the standout products on your wishlist right now? I adore my Tekla bed sheets. While on the more expensive side, they are definitely worth the investment. They’re so cosy, and the simple striped print makes the bed look a little bit more interesting! The Recycled Plastic Stip Puebco is also on my wishlist — it’s the perfect-sized bag for my weekly grocery shops, and can double as a beach bag in summer. Recent Shopping",
