Charlie Fox's New York Flagship Store Nostalgically Celebrates Quiet Luxury New York State legalized the sale of cannabis for adult use on March 31, 2021, with the first licensed dispensaries opening in late 2022. Since then, over 70 dispensaries have launched across the city, with many more expected in the coming year. In such a competitive landscape, standing out is no simple feat, and yet Charlie Fox has done so with remarkable finesse thanks to an ethos that presents cannabis through a luxury lens. Designed in collaboration with Brooklyn-based interior design practice Home Studios, the brand’s three-storey flagship store in the heart of Times Square borrows elements from the most refined hospitality venues to create a transportive environment—part old-world apothecary, part plush cocktail lounge—that challenges conventions, elevates expectations, and redefines what a cannabis dispensary can be.

Known for their narrative-driven residential and hospitality projects, Home Studios’ first foray into retail design highlights the firm’s deep commitment to storytelling and craftsmanship. Underpinned by their penchant for natural materials and finely honed details, their design for Charlie Fox’s flagship draws inspiration from old-world apothecaries, creating a space that exudes both history and modernity. Wooden shelving, vintage-inspired millwork, and stone finishes lend a tactile sense of permanence, imbuing the interior with warmth and a quiet luxury, while botanical accents subtly reinforce Charlie Fox’s dedication to all natural ingredients. At its core, the scheme embodies a philosophy of duality—balancing strength and softness, tradition and innovation, and masculine and feminine energies—as “an homage to the duplexity of nature and the cannabis plant itself”, as the studio’s founder and creative director Oliver Haslegrave explains.

Unlike conventional dispensaries, where products are typically kept at arm’s length behind counters, Charlie Fox fosters engagement with thoughtfully arranged displays throughout the space—albeit securely designed in compliance with dispensary regulations. However, the true essence of the customer experience is encapsulated in the ground-floor sales counter. Conceived as a bar counter, it is manned by the store’s in-house “budtenders,” whose expertise transforms what could be a routine transaction into an intimate consultation, evoking the personalized service of a high-end lounge. The cocktail lounge ambiance hinted at by the sales counter reaches its full expression on the first floor, which unfolds as an elegant salon. This space is designed not merely for retail, but for connection, conversation, and personal engagement where the atmosphere is hushed and inviting, aided by plush seating and soft lighting, encouraging customers to savour the experience at their own pace. Every detail, from the texture of the upholstery to the patina of the fixtures, has been carefully chosen to ensure that the space feels as much like a private residence as a retail environment.

Yet, for all its aesthetic and experiential ambition, Charlie Fox is ultimately about the product, and here too, the brand demonstrates its commitment to refinement and discernment. Catering to both the connoisseur and newcomers, the eclectic range of curated brands, including Charlie Fox’s eponymous product offering, emphasize lower THC doses and natural ingredients sourced from local New York growers. The selection is thoughtfully categorized into four distinct moods—relax, sleep, socialize, and create—allowing customers to approach cannabis consumption with intention and clarity. Beyond the core product range, Charlie Fox also extends its ethos to smoking accessories, home goods, and apparel, each reflecting the brand’s understated elegance and meticulous attention to detail. Cenitz Studio, the multidisciplinary design consultancy behind Charlie Fox’s brand identity, packaging and merchandising, has woven a visual language that echoes the store’s philosophy—sophisticated, timeless, and deeply considered. Inspired by British tradition and New York modernity, the design demystifies the cannabis ritual, presenting it not as an indulgence but as an element of a well-lived life. From the clean, refined logotype, the rich, earthy colour palette blending vibrant warmth with grounded depth, to the tactile richness of the packaging, every element is a study in quiet luxury, reinforcing Charlie Fox’s place at the intersection of heritage and innovation. Slated to open in the spring, a second floor “den” offering exclusive dining and shopping experiences will complete Charlie Fox’s hospitality-driven vision of what cannabis retail can be. In a city so well known for reinvention, the brand’s store transcends the traditional dispensary model, setting a new benchmark for the industry. Photography © Charlie Fox. Photography © Charlie Fox.
