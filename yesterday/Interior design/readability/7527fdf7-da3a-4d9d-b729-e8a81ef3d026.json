  "text": "THE ISTITUTO EUROPEO DI DESIGN (IED) LAUNCHES ITS ORIGINAL PODCASTThe Istituto Europeo di Design (IED) takes on the mission to explore the role of design in creating a more equitable and inclusive future with its itinerant podcast DesignXCommons. Hosted by Matilde Losi, a designer, editor, and curator, the podcast takes listeners on a journey through IED’s locations in Milan, Turin, Florence, and Rome – all from the comfort of a camper van. In each episode, Matilde welcomes a diverse range of guests – from sociologists and economists to designers, curators, and artists – who share their insights through thoughtful discussions, breaking down complex concepts while delving into how design might help us navigate today’s interconnected and often unjust world.‘We live in an era of impasse – but extraordinary at the same time – because for the first time in human history there is a planetary culture. That is, we must start to recognize that, beyond all the violence and the tragedies that may have led to this situation, we have created platforms that allow us to communicate. Users can start from different assumptions but still, there is a culture that is shared by everyone. Which means that any cultural production can only be planetary,’ says Emanuele Coccia, philosopher and lecturer at École des hautes études en sciences sociales and guest of episode 0 of the DesignXCommons podcast: RESET. Matilde Losi, the host of IED’s original DesignXCommons podcast during episode Play with historian Domitilla Dardi and architect Sabrina Morreale (Lemonot) | all images courtesy of IEDEDUCATION INTO ACTION: DRIVING SOCIAL \u0026 ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGEDesignXCommons embodies the belief that design is a transformative platform, capable of driving regenerative change for both society and the environment. This approach is rooted in the idea of ‘common goods,’ which refers to shared resources like land, water, forests, but also more intangible assets like knowledge, the internet, and social services. How we manage, share, and distribute these resources is a process known as ‘Commoning’ – a dynamic relationship that continually evolves between the resource and the community caring for it.The podcast extends the design thinking embedded within the institute’s Master of Arts courses. These specialized two-year programs foster a continuous, dynamic learning environment where students actively engage in interdisciplinary projects with experts across various sectors. The curriculum emphasizes participatory governance models and sustainable practices, which are essential for managing shared assets and creating meaningful societal change. DesignXCommons engages diverse guests to discuss how design can drive positive changeDESIGNXCOMMONS CHALLENGES THE BOUNDARIES OF DESIGN THINKINGEach episode provokes thoughtful discussions, covering essential and important questions like: What happens when we view knowledge as an interconnected system beyond traditional disciplines, how can we shift our perspective to see the world differently, and how do we ensure that today’s designs don’t become tomorrow’s problems? By challenging existing norms, DesignXCommons encourages listeners to rethink education, relationships, and systems – offering insights on how design can play a key role in navigating the complex, interconnected challenges of the modern world.Ready to dive deeper?
