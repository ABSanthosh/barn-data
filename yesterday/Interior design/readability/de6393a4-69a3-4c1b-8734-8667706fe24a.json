The Breggz Zohn-1 shatters every preconception about personal audio with a shocking premise: what if your earbuds were actually made for your ears alone? Not approximately. Not “close enough.” But sculpted precisely to your unique anatomy down to the millimeter. For generations, mass production has forced our ears to adapt to generic shapes. Every wireless earbud on the market—regardless of price—follows this flawed paradigm. The Zohn-1 breaks this pattern entirely. By digitally mapping your exact ear canal structure and creating a custom-fitted device, Breggz has solved the fundamental problem that has plagued personal audio since its inception. Your physiology becomes the starting point of the design, not an inconvenient variable to accommodate. Designer: Breggz Click Here to Buy Now: $2200. Hurry, only 92/100 left! Raised over $72,000. Design Excellence: From Ear to Case Your ears tell a unique story—intricate structures as distinctive as fingerprints. The Zohn-1 acknowledges this biological reality with a revolutionary approach: audio devices should be as individual as the ears they serve. Standard earbuds impose generic shapes on diverse anatomies, creating inevitable compromises. Breggz eliminates these limitations through an ingeniously simple solution. Using just your smartphone camera and the Breggz Scan app, you capture a precise 3D model of your ear canals. No audiologist appointments. No messy impressions. This digital blueprint becomes the foundation for hearables made exclusively for you. The Zohn-1 earbuds have a clean, minimalist style that catches the eye. Their true beauty lies in their purpose: delivering sound with a precision that off-the-shelf products simply can’t match. The custom shells feature a smooth, durable finish that feels luxurious against the skin. They utilize 3D-printed materials with a special bio coating for sensitive skin, ensuring comfort during extended wear. Among the Zohn-1’s most innovative aspects is the “pebble”—an interchangeable module containing the core electronics. This modular approach embodies a design philosophy that values longevity over obsolescence. As technology advances, you can upgrade the module while keeping your custom shells, reducing electronic waste and extending your investment. This consideration for the entire product lifecycle demonstrates a design maturity that looks beyond immediate gratification to long-term satisfaction. The Breggz Zohn-1 charging case immediately sets itself apart with a design that leans into a futuristic, almost cybernetic aesthetic. The case unfolds with a dramatic, mechanical motion, revealing the earbuds inside as if unveiling a hidden artifact. The textured surfaces contrast with the sleek, glossy earbuds, emphasizing the precision engineering behind its form. The exterior panels feature a structured, grid-like texture, providing a tactile surface that complements the industrial feel of the matte black casing. The geometric design, with angular panels that swing open symmetrically, evokes a sense of controlled complexity. The hinge mechanisms are deliberately exposed, adding to the case’s mechanical charm and reinforcing the idea that this isn’t just storage—it’s an experience. A hexagonal hub houses the earbuds at the center of the case. They are adorned with a minimalist crescent logo and small LED indicators that add a futuristic glow. The lights subtly reinforce the branding while serving a functional purpose: indicating charge status and pairing mode. The material selection appears robust, possibly a high-density polymer or reinforced composite, ensuring durability without excessive weight. The opening mechanism suggests a thoughtful balance between security and accessibility, allowing the earbuds to be stored safely while remaining easy to retrieve. The case actively enhances the product’s identity. The unfolding motion, the contrasting textures, and the illuminated branding create a moment of interaction that feels deliberate and immersive. This design makes a statement, turning the everyday act of accessing earbuds into a small but satisfying ritual. Inside the box, you’ll find everything needed to start your Zohn-1 experience: the custom-fitted earbuds themselves, the innovative charging case, a comprehensive cleaning set to maintain optimal performance, tips in six different sizes, and a detailed user manual. Every element of the package reflects the same attention to detail and quality as the earbuds themselves. At its core, the Zohn-1 embodies a philosophy that prioritizes individual excellence over universal adequacy. It challenges the prevailing approach of creating single products for diverse users, instead embracing the complexity of human variation. This personalization philosophy transforms the relationship between a person and technology. When devices adapt to human uniqueness rather than forcing standardization, the result is a more natural, intuitive connection with our tools. Acoustic Engineering Meets Personalization Inside each custom shell, premium balanced armature drivers are meticulously positioned to create an acoustic environment tailored to your unique ear geometry. This precise placement achieves something remarkable—sound reproduction that honors the original recording with exceptional accuracy. The Zohn-1 delivers tight, controlled bass with natural weight. Mids are remarkable in clarity, and highs extend with delicate precision. The spatial audio capabilities construct three-dimensional soundscapes that place you at the center of the performance, while low latency ensures perfect synchronization with visual media. This is possible because of the combination of premium Knowles balanced armature drivers and Mimi Hearing Technologies software, which personalizes audio based on your unique hearing profile. The app includes a hearing test that identifies missing frequencies in your hearing, particularly in the high and low ends and compensates for these with tailored sound adjustments. When the earphones are precisely tailored to your ear’s contours, acoustic leaks are eliminated, enhancing bass response and delivering crystal-clear sound. Thoughtful Integration of Technology Behind the exceptional sound experience lies thoughtful engineering: Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio support maintains rock-solid connections Six beamforming microphones ensure crystal-clear voice capture Active noise cancellation preserves audio fidelity while blocking distractions IPX4 water resistance provides practical durability 8 hours of playback per charge eliminates battery anxiety Yet the Zohn-1’s technical sophistication never calls attention to itself. These technologies serve the core experience without intrusion—the hallmark of truly mature design thinking. Groundbreaking Partnerships Behind the Innovation Breggz Hearables B.V., a luxury technology company, has forged strategic partnerships to create something truly revolutionary. The Zohn-1 emerges from a collaboration between Breggz, B2B hearables development company EAR Micro LLC, and hearable operating systems pioneer Bragi. “Breggz Zohn-1 could not have been developed without our incredible partners at EAR Micro and Bragi,” explains Breggz founder Xander de Buisonjé. “Our vision for the Breggz Zohn-1 is to create the most advanced custom-fit, made-to-order wireless in-ear hearable in the world and to pack it with top-spec audio tech and a host of novel features never before seen in a custom-fit IEM.” This collaboration has resulted in the world’s first audiophile-grade, fully wireless, custom-fit, and exclusively made-to-order luxury in-ear monitor. The Zohn-1 combines cutting-edge technology, expert craftsmanship, and unparalleled design to deliver exceptional fit, acoustic fidelity, and refined aesthetics, redefining the future of audio excellence. Be Among the First: Your Invitation to Audio Revolution The moment has arrived. The Breggz Zohn-1 Kickstarter campaign reached its funding goal within just 48 hours of launch, showing the world’s eagerness for truly personalized audio. Two exclusive options await discerning audio enthusiasts: The Early Bird Edition offers 100 units at €2,015 (approximately $2,194). Your custom-crafted Zohn-1 will be delivered this September. Each pair is customized exclusively for your ears with Mimi Hearing technology. For the ultimate experience, the Special Kickstarter Edition presents an extraordinary opportunity at €4,534 (approximately $4,935). Limited to just 10 sets worldwide, this exclusive package includes a personalized studio session to customize your Breggz sound settings to perfection. This rare collaboration with audio engineers ensures sound tailored not just to your ear anatomy but to your precise listening preferences. Backing the Zohn-1 means commissioning a bespoke audio instrument crafted exclusively for you, with premium drivers and personalization technology that adapts to your unique hearing profile. While many will wait years for such individually tailored audio solutions, the Zohn-1 delivers audiophile quality with personalized technology today, transforming how you experience music, calls, and media through devices that recognize your individuality.
