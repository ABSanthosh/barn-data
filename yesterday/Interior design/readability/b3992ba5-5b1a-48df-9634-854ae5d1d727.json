  "description": "The original Mac's debut in 1984 launched the desktop publishing revolution. A parallel debut of equal importance was the launch of Emigre, a digital type foundry, the same year. Founded by designers Rudy VandeLans and Zuzana Licko, Emigre's influential typefaces--designed specifically for digital--were widely used in 1980s and '90s advertising, branding and publishing. The firm's popularity led to them publishing their own magazine, also called Emigre, which ran until 2005.Now the firm is releasing a book called Emigre Fonts: Type Specimens, 1985 – 2024, an update to a now-sold-out archive first released in 2016. The new version is a comprehensive 1,264-page tome that nearly doubles the length of the original. \"Founded in 1984 by Rudy VanderLans and Zuzana Licko, Emigre was one of the first independent publishers and type foundries to explore the new design possibilities offered by the Macintosh computer. Many people first encountered the foundry's typefaces in the innovative pages of Emigre magazine (1984–2005). But Emigre also issued small booklets to promote the virtues of their fonts and reveal the processes used to design them. More than simple sales tools, these collectible type specimens were enjoyed as much for their inventive contents as for their leading-edge typeface designs.\" \"Emigre Fonts: Type Specimens, 1986–2024, reproduces forty of these booklets in a single massive reference. With a preface from Letterform Archive associate curator Stephen Coles, a foreword from type design collaborator Jeffery Keedy, and a section of never-before-published behind-the-scenes content, this volume provides a near-definitive anthology of the foundry's remarkable story in print.\" Published by Letterform Archive, the book runs $75.",
