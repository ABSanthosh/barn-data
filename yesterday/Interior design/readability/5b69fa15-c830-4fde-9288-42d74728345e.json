  "text": "What happened after light became Vladislav Kislenko’s design language? We got the Lumen Lodge: a space where soft neutrals, natural textures, and clean lines come together. From the moment you step inside, the feeling is unmistakable: calm, curated, quietly luxurious. This isn’t just another modern home. It’s a retreat. A mood. A masterclass in how to create warmth without clutter. Think floor-to-ceiling windows, sculptural lighting, soft earth tones, and just the right touch of drama. Let’s walk through the Lumen Lodge and explore how light, layout, and materials bring this vision to life. From the very first glance, Lumen Lodge commands attention. Its architecture is defined by clean lines, expansive glass panels, and mixed textures. Floor-to-ceiling windows wrap around the structure, blurring the boundaries between indoors and out while flooding the interior with natural light. Steel framing adds an industrial edge. The angular form, paired with the glass facade, creates a sculptural silhouette that feels both grounded and open. Set against a natural backdrop, this home stands like a modern pavilion. Stepping in, you’re instantly wrapped by warmth. The living area is designed for slow mornings, golden hour reflections, and cozy evenings by the fire. Plush, sculptural seating in boucle upholstery invites you to sink in, while low-profile silhouettes keep the space airy. A built-in fireplace anchors the room with sleek sophistication, set beneath a wall-mounted TV. We especially love the stone-clad backdrop! Simultaneously, floor-to-ceiling windows frame the landscape like living art. Minimalism meets purpose in the Lumen Lodge kitchen. With its clean-lined cabinetry, hidden appliances, and soft matte finishes, this space was designed to be as calming as is functional. The waterfall island, dressed in creamy stone, serves as the sculptural centerpiece. Above it, a sleek linear pendant illuminates the space. A warm wood backsplash and open shelving subtly break the monotony. Everything has its place, yet nothing feels busy. This is a kitchen that breathes. Just steps away, the dining area invites intimate conversations under a statement chandelier that floats like art. Soft, sculpted chairs in two-tone finishes surround a rounded table—creating a sense of quiet luxury. In this bedroom, we see a palette of layered neutrals setting the tone. These include sand, stone, and cloud-soft greys, all bathed in gentle natural light that filters through floor-to-ceiling sheers. The upholstered bed anchors the room with plush texture, framed by subtle vertical panels and warm brass pendant lights that seem to float midair. Across the space, a curved vanity and boucle armchair create a quiet corner for rituals and reflection. Every element, from the lighting to the furniture, has been chosen for comfort and calm. Step through to the walk-in closet, and the softness continues. Hidden lighting glows from behind shelves and rails, illuminating the displayed pieces. Matte wood finishes and smart storage create a space that feels as indulgent as it is organized. This secondary bedroom proves that simplicity can be striking. A soft, monochrome palette sets the mood, while clean vertical lines add structure. The custom floating desk and sleek black lighting create a functional yet elegant workspace. In this bathroom, the floating vanity with twin bronze faucets feels sculptural and refined. This is paired with a backlit mirror that casts an ambient glow. Concrete-look walls add an earthy richness, while the elevated shower and WC area subtly defines the space without disruption. Every fixture—from the wall-mounted toilet to the sleek bidet spray—is thoughtfully modern. This bathroom takes spa-level serenity and turns it into everyday living. Veined marble, sleek wood cabinetry, and rose gold fixtures create a rich atmosphere. The floating vanity and freestanding tub feel sculptural, almost like art. With soft lighting, smart storage, and a view that melts stress, this space was made for long soaks!",
