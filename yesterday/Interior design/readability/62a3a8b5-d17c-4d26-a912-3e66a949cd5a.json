  "text": "In the Echo House, designed by Oleksii Samokhvalov, shadows speak softly and every line is drawn with intention. This two-storey retreat strips away the noise of excess and lets texture, light, and stillness do the talking. With its moody palette and quiet luxury, Echo House is a state of mind! Whether you’re drawn to the elegance of restraint or the allure of contrast, this space will be your inspiration. A plush, modular charcoal sofa anchors the living space, inviting quiet conversation or a peaceful solo unwind. The muted tones of the sofa echo the hush of the surrounding palette. The soft area rugs add textural contrast to the rich wood floors, which run fluidly throughout the room. Adjacent to the lounge, a sculptural round dining table takes center stage beneath an oversized dome pendant. The black, curved-back chairs complement the table’s deep tone, creating a cohesive vignette that feels grounded. It’s minimalist, yes—but never cold. Floor-to-ceiling sheer drapes frame the expansive glass doors that open onto the outdoor patio. By day, natural light pours in and reflects softly off the matte finishes. By dusk, the interior glows in warm pools of indirect lighting, while the patio becomes an extension of the indoor experience: an al fresco sanctuary cocooned in greenery. Let’s step outdoors for a moment before touring the rest of the Echo House. Layered with textural greens and punctuated by floating concrete steps, the garden in the Echo House feels like a quiet procession into nature. Minimalist lounging zones with oversized cushions let you sink into comfort. At the top of the path, a sleek outdoor dining area connects directly to the indoor lounge through large sliding glass doors. Evening lighting is subtle yet dramatic, with ground-level fixtures illuminating the path, the plants, and the outlines of outdoor furniture. We love that moody glow! The entire landscape is built to draw you in, inviting slow walks, lingering conversations, and moments of pause. Next, let’s step into the kitchen, cloaked in deep charcoal tones and honed stone surfaces. We like to call it a “quietly powerful” space. The dramatic, veined stone countertop wraps seamlessly around the island and backsplash. This makes for a sculptural focal point. Matte black fixtures and hardware keep the aesthetic razor-sharp, while open shelves and rail systems provide sleek utility. Subtle under-cabinet lighting accentuates the depth of the stone and adds a soft glow. Whether you’re preparing a slow Sunday breakfast or hosting drinks with friends, this space sets the tone for grounded luxury. The bedroom at Echo House features a low-profile upholstered bed, dressed in soft grey and crisp white. It is placed against a dark wood-paneled accent wall that adds depth. Minimalist black nightstands and integrated lighting maintain the clean lines. Simultaneously, a glowing orb pendant offers a moonlike presence over the bedside. Natural light spills in through full-height glass doors that lead to a private balcony, where residents can sit and have a coffee break. The kids’ room is a gentle blend of functionality and softness. The elevated bed, wrapped in warm beige tones and framed by crisp white rails, adds playfulness while maximizing space. Below, soft draped curtains conceal a cozy hideaway—a quiet nook for reading. Opposite the bed, a built-in study zone stretches wall to wall under a wide window. The desk is kept minimal, yet smart, with floating shelves. This encourages focused, clutter-free learning. A modern white swivel chair and soft grey carpeting keep the environment calm. Pale wardrobe doors with playful leather loop handles add a tactile element. Altogether, the room embraces a serene palette and practical layout. Monochrome palettes dominate, with deep charcoal tiles juxtaposed against crisp white floating vanities and streamlined fixtures. The contrast is bold, but never brash. In the main bathroom, an integrated shower area is softened by soft lighting and tactile finishes. Subtle details—like the grid of mini-tiles, the low-slung black stool, and the linear towel warmer—add style. In the secondary bathroom, a lighter palette takes over, yet the same minimalism shines through. Wall-hung sanitaryware and built-in storage maintain a sense of openness.",
