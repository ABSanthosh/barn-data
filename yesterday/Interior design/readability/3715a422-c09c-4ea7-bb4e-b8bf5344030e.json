  "text": "If you haven’t read already, I’ve put GaN chargers on my list of 7 must-have tech products for 2025. GaN is dethroning Silicon as a more efficient semiconductor material, resulting in charging bricks and hubs that are smaller, more powerful, faster, and even more power-efficient. The tech world is shifting, and it’s happening at the microscopic level. Belkin is taking full advantage of this shift with its newly announced USB-C 11-in-1 Pro GaN Dock 150W, an all-in-one productivity hub that combines power, connectivity, and high-speed data transfers in a sleek, compact package. Announced at MWC 2025, this docking station isn’t just another port expander—it’s a workhorse built for power users who need to connect everything, charge fast, and keep their workflow seamless. This little box punches way above its weight. GaN (gallium nitride) technology has been creeping into chargers for a while now, but seeing it power a full-fledged docking station is where things get really interesting. By ditching traditional silicon components, Belkin’s dock pushes 146W of total power through a much smaller, cooler, and more efficient form factor. 96W goes straight to your laptop, keeping even demanding machines like a 16-inch MacBook Pro running at full tilt, while the remaining 50W distributes to other connected accessories. It’s the kind of power delivery that lets you charge, transfer data, and run multiple devices without a second thought. Designer: Belkin Monitors? Bring them all. This dock can drive up to three external displays on Windows, maxing out at 8K at 30Hz for a single screen or 4K at 60Hz across three monitors. That’s serious real estate for designers, coders, and multitaskers who need multiple screens to work efficiently. Mac users get dual 4K monitor support, which, given Apple’s long-standing hardware limitations, is still a solid setup. The two HDMI 2.0 ports and USB-C DP-Alt port provide plenty of flexibility for arranging an ideal multi-monitor workspace, whether you’re deep in a Premiere Pro timeline or tracking stocks across different screens. Two USB-A 10Gbps ports and a USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 (10Gbps) port ensure that external SSDs, cameras, and other accessories transfer data at blistering speeds. Need to quickly offload a batch of RAW photos or a massive video project? No problem. There’s also an additional USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 (5Gbps) port with 20W power delivery, perfect for juicing up tablets or smartphones while keeping them connected. The SD and microSD 3.0 card slots are a godsend for photographers and videographers who don’t want to fiddle with adapters. Gigabit Ethernet ensures a rock-solid, high-speed internet connection, which is a must for remote workers, gamers, or anyone tired of inconsistent Wi-Fi. Even the 3.5mm audio in/out jack makes a return, a rare but welcome addition for those who still prefer wired headphones or need a reliable mic input for calls and recordings. Belkin isn’t playing around when it comes to safety, either. The 6-point protection system guards against over-current, over-temperature, over-voltage, short circuits, and overloads, all wrapped in fire-resistant materials. It’s the kind of built-in security that gives peace of mind, especially for anyone using expensive gear that can’t afford to be fried by a faulty dock. Aside from being power-efficient, Belkin’s looking at sustainability on a macro level too. The housing is made from at least 75% post-consumer recycled materials, and the packaging is 100% plastic-free. It’s a small but meaningful step in making high-performance accessories more sustainable without cutting corners on durability. At $199.99, the USB-C 11-in-1 Pro GaN Dock 150W earns its spot as a must-have for serious users who need a single hub that does everything. Fewer cables, faster speeds, more power—what’s not to love?!",
