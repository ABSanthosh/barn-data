  "text": "Wiradjuri woman Hannah Lange’s artworks are incredibly detailed and time consuming. She wouldn’t have it any other way, as each one connects her to Country and stories that need to be told. ‘I owe a lot of my driving force to one of my Aunties who is sadly no longer with us. She was part of the stolen generation and her story stays with me,’ Hannah explains. ‘How she had her identity, culture and family stripped from her… it drives me every day to continue to be proud to share our culture with the world.’ Hannah’s unique contemporary style also allows her to share her own lived experiences, and her personal relationship with the land. Her latest body of work, ‘Yuranha’, explores the constant movement and evolution of Country – from the shifting sandstone and clay cliff faces in the Blue Mountains, to the shedding of bark on a tree – and we’re thrilled to present this beautiful collection of paintings as our first TDF exhibition for 2025. ‘Yuranha’ is the Wiradjuri word for ‘grow’, which Hannah says perfectly encapsulates the pieces in this exhibition, and her ever evolving style. ‘I’ve been inspired by the constant transformation of Country and have been exploring more movement and fluidity in my work,’ she says. ‘Nature’s cycle is a powerful metaphor, one of renewal, change and the lessons we can learn from Country.’ Yuranha TDF Gallery 14 Little Oxford Street Collingwood, VIC Opening night: Thursday March 13, 5.30pm – 7.30pm Exhibition dates: Friday March 14, 10am – 4pm Saturday March 15, 10am – 4pm Sunday March 16, CLOSED Monday March 17, 10am – 4pm Tuesday March 18, 10am – 4pm For all artwork sales and enquiries please contact art@thedesignfiles.net and we’ll get back to you ASAP.",
