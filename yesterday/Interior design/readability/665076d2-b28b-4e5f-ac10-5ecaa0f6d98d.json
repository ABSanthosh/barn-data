The Rice House was designed by celebrated post-war architect Kevin Borland in the early 1950s, as part of an initiative that connected people wanting to build with qualified architects.

  "text": "When Melbourne couple John and Renee Edgley bought this mid-century gem in 2016, it was in a dilapidated state. The heritage-listed Eltham home, known as The Rice House, is an early design by acclaimed architect Kevin Borland, who trained under icons like Roy Grounds and Robin Boyd. It was commissioned by Harrie and Lorna Rice in 1951 when they met Kevin through The Age RVIA Small Homes Service — an initiative lead by Robin Boyd to build new and unique architectural homes across Melbourne. What he came up with was a boundary-pushing design featuring two distinctive dwellings shaped by concrete archways growing up from the ground. It was built almost like a bunker on the top of a leafy hillside block, framing views out towards the CBD and the Dandenongs. ‘The Rices lived there for roughly sixty years until their passing, then the property stood empty for a few years, slowly degrading under the onslaught of weather, vegetation and infestation,’ John says. The family’s estate eventually listed the house for sale in 2016, immediately catching the eyes of John and Renee. ‘We were keen participants in the Open House Melbourne program, amateur mid-century modern enthusiasts — and John has a mildly obsessive relationship with concrete,’ Renee says. ‘The sculptural concrete form of Rice House called to us, and once we visited the site that first weekend, we couldn’t walk away.’ The couple started the almost decade-long process of bringing the home back to its former glory with the guidance of Heritage Victoria, and in 2019 they moved in with their two young sons. ‘Almost every aspect of the home has been touched in some way to ensure it is in keeping with the original building. Heritage architect and specialist Giampiero Tilli of GT Architecture oversaw the site and building restoration,’ John says. The iconic concrete structure is one of only three homes in Victoria built using the Ctesiphon technique, which is why the building has now been fully restored and waterproofed to give the house another hundred years of life. All utilities have been modernised too, including water, power, hot water, reverse cycle air conditioning and wood fired heating. What hasn’t changed is how ‘remarkably spacious’ the small format, three-bedroom house feels. ‘It truly embodies the iconic mid-century modern design philosophy,’ John says. Sitting amongst the trees on a 4000-square-metre block, the larger of the shell-like structures features the kitchen, living area, family room, bathroom and main bedroom. Meanwhile the second part reveals two additional bedrooms and a bathroom. This unconventional floorplan means almost every room gets a view and access to the outdoors, without losing a sense of privacy. ‘The living spaces are so well integrated into the outdoors,’ John says. ‘The feeling of openness is invigorating. From both inside and outside the organic sculptural form of the building creates such a special place. Lying under that concrete sky at night is just a very special experience.’ With the restoration all wrapped up, The Rice House is now on the market once again. And thanks to John and Renee’s care, this time, the lucky buyers will get to enjoy it from the moment they get the keys. 69 Ryans Road, Eltham, VIC 3095 is listed for private sale with Chris Chapman at Jellis Craig North East.",
