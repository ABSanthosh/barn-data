  "description": "Today Adidas releases their 3D-printed Climacool Laced sneakers. Last year they released a similar shoe that was a slip-on, but this time they've gone with eyelets. The polymer kicks are printed as one piece, except for the laces and the conventional mesh tongue, which are both added afterwards. (The tongue is presumably bonded to the inside of the shoe, rathern than sewn; the company doesn't say.) \"Inspired by the sensation of transformative structures, these shoes adjust and conform to your environment. With a lightweight, multidimensional lattice configuration, they're built for airflow and movement. A foot-hugging design provides a 360 degree airflow for all-day comfort. CLIMACOOL wicks and disperses sweat for cool, dry and distraction-free performance.\" The novel production method doesn't bring any time savings: The company says that between the \"spinning, baking, and compression\" required for the polymer blend—the specifics of which have not been revealed—each pair takes 24 hours to produce. The shoes are only available in one colorway, the one you see in the photos. They run $160.",
