Sure, white might be the most popular color for living room walls, and with good reason — it feels airy, goes with everything, and can make even the smallest of spaces appear larger. However, you can paint your home black for a similar atmosphere as long as you understand how to use the hue.Black paint can be comforting, versatile, and expansive, but one false brushstroke and your room can appear the exact opposite: drab, dreary, and downright dull. How do you toe the line between a black room that’s stylish and one that feels spiritless? I asked several design pros for the most common mistakes people make when painting their walls black — and how to fix these popular problems. Mistake #1: Selecting the Darkest BlackLike white paint, black comes in a bunch of undertones and nuances, so it’s important to choose wisely. “Depending on the purpose of the room, the darkest black can sometimes come across as harsh,” designer Beth McMillan says. “A softer-toned black, which is just the slightest bit up from jet black, will still be extremely dramatic with a high contrast, but just a bit softer to the eye and more elegant in feel.”To find the right shade for your space, pay attention to a paint’s undertones. “Not all blacks are created equal,” designer Kristina Phillips says. “Some have cool undertones like blue or green, while others lean warm with hints of brown or red. These subtle nuances can clash with the surrounding finishes, lighting, or furniture, throwing off the entire look of the space.”Meanwhile, Price Latimer, chief creative officer and cofounder of Alkemis Paint, says it’s imperative to test a desired paint color in a small area first. “Black paint can look different depending on the lighting and the undertones of your space, as well as have markedly distinct undertones itself,” she adds. Looking for a smart way to streamline the swatching process? Here are a few tips for choosing wall colors that can help.Mistake #2: Not Properly Preparing Your WallsBlack paint brings a lot to the table, but it’s not the most forgiving. In fact, the deep hue is prone to showing imperfections. “The darker the paint, the more flaws you see,” designer Cyndy Cantley says. “Every crack and blemish will be amplified.”  Proper preparation sets the foundation for an easy, well-appointed application, so Maya Crowne, CEO and cofounder, of Alkemis Paint, recommends cleaning your walls and patching up any cracks. “Use the correct primer for the underlying substrate,” she shares. “Ask your painting contractor for assistance if you can’t figure it out yourself.”Mistake #3: Selecting the Wrong FinishJust when you thought selecting the right paint shade was the toughest decision you’d have to make, you still need to choose the proper finish. So, what’s it going to be? Gloss or matte? While McMillan says a matte black can give a room “an old-world chalky look,” Phillips argues that the finish does have its flaws. “Matte black walls tend to absorb light, leaving the room feeling flat and lifeless,” she says. Instead, Phillips recommends opting for a glossy finish. “These reflective surfaces bounce light around, adding depth, drama, and a sense of luxury,” she explains. “Paired with strategic lighting — such as wall sconces or uplighting — it transforms the room into an elegant, visually striking space that feels dynamic, not oppressive.” Not only does this finish keep a room from feeling dreary, but McMillan says high-gloss or lacquer is “all about glam.” Mistake #4: Overlooking Your LightingBlack can be cozy and inviting, but it still is a very dark color. You probably don’t want to turn a black room into a black hole, so remember to be mindful of your accessories. When it comes to functional spaces, especially, go with lots of light if you’re painting it black. “A kitchen is a room you are working in, and you need to be able to see, so task lighting is extremely important,” Cantley shares.  “Overhead, sconces, and a lamp will give you what you need depending on your task.” Go ahead, get your shine on.",
