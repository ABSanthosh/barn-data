  "description": "As an architecture student, Marcio Sequeira wanted to better understand structural behavior. Seeking a more hands-on way than equations and diagrams can provide, Sequeira began building structural models using elements connected by magnetics. He started off with wooden dowels, and experimented with plastic and rubber components before settling on springs. After gaining his architecture degree in 2005, Sequeira pursued a Masters in Civil Engineering. For his thesis project in 2008, he demonstrated the scientific validation of his structural modeling system. Sequeira subsequently sought investors, seeking to mass produce his structural kits for educational use. After finding no takers, in 2014 he successfully Kickstarted his Mola Structural Kit 1. Today Sequiera's company, Mola, offers multiple kits and sells them in over 100 countries. Over 800 universities, including MIT and Switzerland's EPFL use Mola Kits to teach students; roughly 600 architecture and engineering firms have purchased them as well. Here's their latest Kit, the Mola Kit 4, which was recently (successfully) Kickstarted:You can learn more about Mola Kits here.",
