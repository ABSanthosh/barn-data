But if you operate with simplicity, finding the ideal gift for a man is ridiculously easy. They make their passions known so well – they don’t hide their feelings, they’re open about their likes and dislikes, and if you’re ever in doubt, just give them something they’ll love showing off – like this Pocket Tanto blade from Blank Forces that I think makes the perfect Father’s Day gift. Designed with a simplicity not too often seen in the world of over-the-top tanto knives, this one has the appeal of something classy like a Rimowa Travel Case, with its ribbed handle that houses the American Tanto blade. The design comes in two variants – one featuring an all-titanium handle, and another with a carbon fiber scales handle. Both, however, house the classy-yet-edgy M390 steel blade within, that you can pop out and use for everything a dad would do – from cutting open letters to scraping flint to start a fire, or whittling away at wood. Designer: BlankForces The Pocket Tanto truly is a thing of beauty – and it lies in the details. The entire thing is designed to be compact, fitting into most pockets with ease. The compact build leaves you with a compact blade to match, measuring in at just 1.5″ long, which most purists would say isn’t effective, but that’s where the Pocket Tanto proves them wrong. Its dual-edge blade, forged from high-performance martensitic M390 steel is perfect for all activities. The American Tanto format leaves you with two points that are perfect for piercing, and two edges that work great for cutting, slicing, and scraping. To keep it visually and physically light, the blade sports a tanto-shaped cutout too, which not just brings down the weight, but also lets you comfortably open the knife with two hands. For a more dramatic opening, a flipper enables single-handed deployment, while a frame lock holds the blade in place while you ‘knife’ away. Inside, an ultra-smooth ball-bearing pivot gives you a buttery-smooth action that your (or your dad’s) hands will love constantly engaging with. Both titanium and carbon fiber variants are identical in shape and size, although the latter is slightly lighter at 1.25oz (35 grams) as opposed to the titanium’s 1.4oz (40 grams) weight. Personally, I’d trade weight for functionality, because the titanium handle has this ribbed texture that’s just more satisfying to hold, compared to the smooth finish on the carbon fiber scales version. The knives are priced at $159 (down from the $189 price tag), and come with built-in pocket clips (that you can remove, if you want), as well as a 1.25″ keyring secured around the ring-hole on the back of the knife. The Pocket Tanto was born in 2023 as the result of a Kickstarter campaign that raised nearly $60,000. The knife ships for free in the US, dispatching in under 2 days, which means you could pick one up right now and have it deliver well before the 15th of June.",
