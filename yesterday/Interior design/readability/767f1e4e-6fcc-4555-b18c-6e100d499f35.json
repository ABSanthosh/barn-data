  "text": "Talk about hand-rolled cigars filled with eminently aged tobacco and you can’t fail to name Arturo Fuente Cigar Factory. The company that is celebrating the 25th anniversary of OpusX – its finest cigars, also considered the best in the world. To mark the occasion, the cigar factory has in collaboration with Hublot created one of the most intricately designed watches dubbed the Classic Fusion Chronograph Arturo Fuente King Gold. The word gold in the name is not just symbolic. The watch really uses King Gold in the case and the bezel. Notably the first to do it. If you are wondering how the two exceptional brands in their own niches have come together for a watch; this is surely not their first outing together. Hublot and Arturo Fuente have had numerous fruitful partnerships since 2012, which has extended beyond just watches; their collaboration has also been toward supporting charitable initiatives in the Dominican Republic. Designer: Hublot Arturo Fuente Cigar Factory x Hublot’s latest collaborative timepiece, the Classic Fusion Chronograph Arturo Fuente King Gold, is sixth Hublot and Arturo Fuente special edition watch. It has been delt with an inspiring gold and green theme that radiates the celebratory aesthetic imperative of the significant milestone in the journey of the most delectable cigar. To that accord, the Classic Fusion Chronograph Arturo Fuente King Gold is strictly limited to only 50 examples, which would be available through Hublot boutiques and the watch brand’s authorized retailers. The 42mm Classic Fusion Chronograph case features a bezel laser-engraved with motif of tobacco leaves. Both the case and the bezel are made from king gold while the dial features vibrant, emerald green hue covered by two subdials at 9 and 3 o’clock, the hands, and indices. Even though its sunray finish and gradient fume effect darkening toward the bezel creates a magical effect. Special feature only for the owner The Hublot logo at 12 o’clock and the OpusX anniversary version logo behind the seconds hand in the subdial at 3 o’clock complete the branding on the dial. The watch is powered by a HUB1153 automatic chronograph calibre that offers 48-hour power reserve. The special aspect of the timepiece is the collaboration and it is excessively reserved for the owner on the caseback. The Classic Fusion Chronograph Arturo Fuente King Gold features one elaborately done caseback. It is made from 18k King Gold and is engraved with OpusX 25th anniversary graphics. The interesting watch is paired with a matching green alligator leather or rubber strap, and it comes packed in green lacquered watch box that doubles as a cigar humidor. This must have watch for a cigar connoisseurs costs CHF 36,900 ($42,000).",
