  "description": "Saudi Arabia is currently building the largest urban park in the world. At six square miles the King Salman Park, which should be completed around 2026, will be five times the size of New York's Central Park. The Visitor's Centre was erected last year. Designed by Adjaye Associates, the firm headed by Ghanaian-British architect Sir David Adjaye, the structure features rammed-earth walls precisely placed to create passive cooling. What really caught my eye is this handrail detail that I've never seen before:I poked around and found a couple other examples of recessed handrails (they're pretty rare). This is at Bloomberg's Hong Kong office, designed by Neri \u0026 Hu: And this is at a private residence in Toronto, designed by PLANT Architect Inc.: I prefer Adjaye's design over the other two. There's something decidedly unfriendly about the right angle corner the latter two designs present you with.",
