  "text": "Most tiny homes of just seven meters long (23.6 feet) and 2.5 meters wide (8.2 feet) feel cramped, but the Avanti SE is blessed with spaciousness. Its dual-loft design increases both accommodation and openness while keeping a compact footprint. With strategically placed windows throughout, every main living space enjoys abundant natural light and airiness. The Avanti SE can sleep up to three people in a two-bedroom layout, ideal for small families or as an Airbnb. The larger bedroom, accessed by a built-in staircase, features a double bed, two side windows, a large skylight, and extra storage space. Designer: Kookaburra Tiny Homes The second loft in the Avanti SE is tailored to fit a single bed and, while it offers less storage than the main bedroom, it makes up for it with its impressive brightness, thanks to expansive windows that frame beautiful views. This loft is located above the entrance and accessed by a simple, movable ladder—perfect for occasional use as a guest room, a child’s bedroom, or even as a sunlit, elevated lounge for quiet relaxation or reading. Among Kookaburra Tiny Homes’ three Avanti models, the SE is the most sophisticated with an elegant dual-loft design, Scandinavian-inspired white-and-natural wood interiors, and stylish ceiling beams that highlight the home’s geometry. Even the timber railings echo these geometric lines, contributing to a visually balanced, contemporary atmosphere that feels both welcoming and refined. The elegant design of the partial safety railings enhances the home’s overall brightness. With unobstructed sightlines between the lofts and clear views from each room to the main living area below, the interior feels spacious, open, and seamlessly connected. On the ground floor, the lounge is bathed in natural light from a large rear window, while the glass entrance door adds to the home’s airy atmosphere. The kitchen is equally inviting, featuring expansive sliding windows that blur the boundary between indoors and outdoors. Thoughtfully sized for a dual-loft tiny home, the kitchen includes a stylish countertop with a breakfast bar and built-in shelves along its edge, serving the hallway and entrance. There’s space for full-size appliances, though most storage is cleverly integrated beyond traditional cabinetry. In the Avanti SE, most storage is cleverly built into the staircase, which includes a fridge tower and shelves for smaller appliances, while the kitchen features only a few drawers and cabinets. This design helps maintain the home’s bright, open feel by avoiding bulky storage that could block the light or views. Golden fixtures add a touch of elegance to the minimalist kitchen and bathroom. The bathroom is equipped with a full-size shower, a sliding glass door, a small vanity, and a large window for natural light. Pricing starts at USD$ 72,450 with optional off-grid packages available.",
