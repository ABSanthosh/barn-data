  "text": "As artificial intelligence continues to advance, creating art, writing stories, and even making decisions for us, there are still fundamental aspects of life where human presence remains essential. Parenting is one such domain, raising a child, nurturing a family, and forming emotional bonds cannot be automated. However, technology can play a crucial role in alleviating the burden of strenuous household tasks, enabling parents to focus on what truly matters: quality time with their children. Keepy, a home-operator robotic vacuum cleaner, is designed to support overall housework beyond just cleaning. The inspiration behind Keepy is deeply personal, drawn from the creator’s childhood memories of bedtime stories. While books provided valuable knowledge, the lasting impact came from the warmth and affection of shared moments with parents. Unfortunately, modern parents, particularly those in dual-income households, often struggle to find time for meaningful interactions due to the exhaustion of daily responsibilities. Designer: Dohyuk Joo Instead of reading to their children, many parents resort to educational automation devices, such as reading pens. While these tools are useful, they cannot replicate the warmth and comfort of a parent’s voice. Keepy seeks to change this dynamic by handling household management tasks, ensuring parents have more time to be present with their children. Throughout history, household appliances have evolved to reduce the time and effort spent on domestic tasks. Washing machines freed families from the drudgery of manual laundry, dishwashers streamlined kitchen cleanup, and robotic vacuum cleaners introduced automated floor cleaning. Keepy builds on this tradition by going beyond simple automation, it actively manages household operations. Household management is more than just cleaning; it includes tracking grocery expiration dates, ensuring laundry is removed on time, keeping up with school events, and managing essential supplies. Traditional appliances perform their tasks in a fixed manner, but with the advancement of IoT and AI, home appliances like Keepy are becoming more proactive. Unlike conventional robotic vacuum cleaners, Keepy does more than just clean. It acts as a household assistant, identifying emerging needs and filling in blind spots. By integrating with smart home appliances, Keepy can analyze supply usage, predict shortages, and even recommend or automatically order essential maintenance items. As an active home operator, Keepy patrols the house, ensuring that everything runs smoothly. It can remind parents of unpaid utility bills, check food stock levels, and turn off appliances when needed. In essence, it operates as a silent yet efficient partner in managing the complexities of family life. Beyond functionality, Keepy’s design sets it apart. Inspired by a playful toy patrol officer, its warm and approachable appearance ensures it blends seamlessly into a home environment. An Emoji Face LED display makes it engaging for children and pets, reducing any potential apprehension towards an AI-driven home assistant. By reimagining the role of a robotic vacuum, Keepy extends beyond cleaning to become an integral part of family life. It embodies a future where technology enhances human connections rather than replacing them, allowing parents to spend less time managing chores and more time creating lasting memories with their children.",
