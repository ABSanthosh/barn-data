After relocating from the US to Germany, I had a hard time replacing my beloved box spring and mattress from the States, and I missed it so much. I had invested a lot of money into my bed back in Boston, but reasoned it was a waste to ship it here because surely I’d find something just like it when I moved to Germany.That was back in 2009, which wasn’t at all the case - I sadly learned that too late. Everything at that time was the lattenrost system— wooden slats in a giant frame that replace the traditional box spring system. On top of the lattenrost frame, you place your mattress. Losing that box spring comfort broke my heart. I struggled with back problems for years in Germany because I couldn’t find the right bed at least, until I was in Helsinki in 2018 and discovered Matri at the Habitare Design Fair. “I have to have a bed like this in Germany”, I thought. That was my resolve. Shortly after, I started to research Matri and found that, to my utter shock and joy, they sold their beds in Hannover-based store called Fennobed. A year later, in 2019, the Fennobed store made my dreams come true when my Matri bed showed up (I wrote about it here). Little did we know, but that bed was perfectly time to the pandemic because not long after, Corona hit and I needed my cozy bed more than ever. In fact, my Matri bed so inviting that on some night’s, my son would sneak in during the middle of the night because he loved how comfortable is was compared to his bed. He was sleeping on a small but beautiful Danish bed with a latten rost system and a very slim mattress. He wanted my bed and I had to find a way to make his dream come true.That’s why I decided to visit Fennobed once again (in Hannover, Germany) to select a bed for him this time - something smaller than mine but perfectly sized for an 11-year-old boy. He is working hard in school now and so he requires the best night’s sleep for his studies. And since he always loved my bed, I told him I’d get him something just like it and wow, was he excited!Happy to say, he got his dream bed delivered before Christmas, making it a wonderful holiday present. I wanted to wait a bit before posting about it to ensure I could give the most accurate review, especially since I needed to see if the bed really made a difference in his sleep quality and mood overall.All I can say is this is a FIVE STAR bed - He loves it and sleeps so sound each night, he looks forward to sleeping in his bed after all these years, and wakes up in a good mood and no more complaints of feeling uncomfortable or jealous that we have the “nice” bed as he used to say,Not only is the bed beautifully crafted and stylish, but it’s also built with health, well-being, and sustainability in mind. I picked out the beautiful mustard-color linen headboard, which he also loves, and all of the bedding is from Matri too - making it masculine and a bit “grown up” compared to his dinosaur bedding previously.Why Sleep is So Important for Our Children (and Us Too!)We all know the feeling of waking up groggy and irritable, but poor sleep affects more than just our mood. Especially for children, quality sleep is crucial for healthy development. Studies show that deep, restful sleep helps with memory consolidation, emotional regulation, physical growth, and overall cognitive performance. A good night’s sleep also strengthens the immune system, reduces stress, and even enhances creativity.For my son, having a supportive and comfortable mattress has meant more restful nights and more energized days. He wakes up refreshed, full of energy, and ready to conquer the day. It’s remarkable to see the difference that a high-quality bed can make.It’s not just about getting enough hours of sleep; it’s about the quality of that sleep. A supportive mattress that properly aligns the spine and relieves pressure points is essential. If your body is out of alignment, you’ll toss and turn, reducing the amount of deep sleep you get. Deep sleep is when the body repairs itself, muscles grow, and tissues regenerate. It’s also crucial for memory processing and emotional stability.Matri’s mattresses are designed with this in mind. They provide the perfect balance of comfort and support, ensuring that the spine is aligned and that there is no undue pressure on the shoulders and hips. This ergonomic support helps prevent back pain and promotes deep, restorative sleep. I have struggled with back pain for most of my life, which is why I am willing to invest in a bed that allows me to live with less pain - and in this case - pain-free. I barely have back pain since I started sleeping on my Matri bed which is why I’m so happy our son has one too! Why We Chose Matri and FennobedWhen choosing a bed for him, I didn’t want to compromise on quality or health. Matri and Fennobed stood out for several reasons:First, for it’s Eco-Friendly and Non-Toxic Materials: In today’s world, it’s not just about comfort but also about safety. I’m incredibly conscious of the materials used in our home. Many conventional mattresses are made with harmful chemicals, flame retardants, and synthetic foams that off-gas toxins. These can cause headaches, allergies, and even long-term health issues. Matri uses natural, eco-friendly materials that are safe for both people and the planet. I feel good knowing that Aidan is sleeping on a mattress free from harmful chemicals.Sustainability at Its Core: Matri and Fennobed are committed to sustainability. From the natural materials used to the eco-friendly manufacturing processes, they are dedicated to reducing their environmental footprint. It’s important to me to support brands that care about our planet. This matters. Sustainability is not a trend - it’s the future.The Comfort of a Box spring System: Matri’s box spring beds provide the support and comfort that I love. They offer that luxurious, hotel-like sleep experience - It’s like a dream come true to finally find this level of quality here in Germany. And it’s not just about comfort—choosing an eco-friendly mattress has significant health benefits:Allergy Relief: Natural materials like cotton, wool, and latex are hypoallergenic and resistant to dust mites, mold, and bacteria.Chemical-Free Sleep: No harmful off-gassing means no headaches or respiratory issues. Just pure, clean air in his room.Temperature Regulation: Natural fibers are breathable and help regulate body temperature, ensuring a comfortable sleep environment year-round. My Son’s Experience with His Matri BedWell… He absolutely loves his new bed! Before his new bed came along, he would often wake up in the middle of the night. He was quite irritable in the mornings, too. Since his new bed arrived, he sleeps a full night and wakes up refreshed, chatty, and ready to go to school in a good mood. His room has finally become his little sanctuary, a place where he feels comfortable and safe. And as a mom, nothing makes me happier than knowing he’s getting the rest he needs to grow, learn, and thrive. I also sleep a full night without him waking me up at 4 or 5am as he previously did for so many years. A full night’s sleep has a massive effect on my mood and well-being all day, so I’m grateful his good experience has a huge advantage for us all. I genuinely can’t say enough good things about our experience with Matri and Fennobed. The entire process, from selecting the bed to delivery and setup, was seamless and professional. Their customer service at Fennobed in Hannover, with Basil the Store Manager, is outstanding, and they truly care about the health and happiness of their customers.If you’re in the market for a new bed and want to invest in your health and well-being, I highly recommend checking out Matri of Finland and visiting Fennobed in Hannover. I’m so grateful to see Aidan sleeping soundly and waking up with a smile on his face.BED RECIPE:OONA Color Continental 100x200 cm / FIRM / Matratze + UnterbettAlaska Slim 95 Headboard 100x95, Farbe 3261, 100% cottonMio Plus Topper 100 x 200 cm, 7cm highFeet 15cm Round, 55 Birke Sand (4)Matri Envelope Sheet NOORA, 100x200 cm whiteMatri pillow covers, SAARA, 50x60 + 80x80, nougatMatri duvet cover, SAARA, 135x200, nougatMatri blanket, TUULI, 160x260, CornThank you, Matri and Fennobed, we couldn’t be happier.
