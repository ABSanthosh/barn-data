  "text": "Tucked into the wooded hills of Hungary’s Dunabogdány village, Console House by Hello Wood offers a peaceful retreat above the Danube Bend. This minimalist getaway is designed to blend quietly with its natural setting, embodying the Japanese-inspired approach of simplicity and respect for the landscape. The house is elevated on slim stilts, creating the impression that it hovers gently above the forest floor. This smart design leaves the land mostly untouched, letting rainwater flow and wildlife roam freely underneath. Console House’s position, hidden among the trees, provides calming views of the green valley below, making it an ideal spot for quiet reflection or relaxation. Designer: Hello Wood Hello Wood, known for its thoughtful use of timber, uses clean lines and natural materials throughout the home. Large windows invite daylight into the interiors, establishing a strong link to the outdoors while maintaining privacy. There’s a clear focus on uncluttered space and functional design, allowing residents to enjoy the essentials without distraction. Console House makes an impression not with bold statements, but with its careful attention to detail and harmony with the environment. It’s a modern escape that prioritizes serenity, sustainability, and a deep connection to nature—an ideal retreat for those seeking simplicity and calm. Console House balances subtlety with boldness in its design. Its star feature is a long, cantilevered roof that defines the house’s silhouette and gives it a distinct identity. This overhang shelters a generous 291-square-foot terrace, nearly matching the size of the indoor living space. The terrace acts as an extension of the home, seamlessly connecting the interior with the outdoors. Floor-to-ceiling glass opens up the living area to the landscape, allowing natural light to fill the space and offering uninterrupted views. Mornings on the terrace are quiet and restorative, with mist from the Danube rising in the distance. This thoughtful design blurs the line between inside and outside, encouraging residents to enjoy the changing scenery and fresh air throughout the day. Console House showcases how careful architectural choices can create a peaceful, immersive living experience rooted in its surroundings. Console House reflects a deep commitment to environmental responsibility in both its materials and construction. Hello Wood used cross-laminated timber and laminated beams for the structure, ensuring strength while minimizing environmental impact. Instead of a traditional concrete foundation, the house rests on eco-friendly screw piles, significantly reducing the footprint and allowing for swift assembly—the main frame was completed in just over a day. The exterior is finished with charred timber using the Japanese shou sugi ban technique, which gives the cladding a rich, black texture and protects the wood naturally. This finish blends the house into the forest and adds a tactile depth to its appearance. From a distance, Console House almost floats among the branches like a modern treehouse, while up close, the careful craftsmanship is clear in every detail. Designed for year-round comfort, it offers a mindful, modern retreat in nature.",
