This timepiece reinterprets traditional skeleton watch structures through algorithmic generation, moving beyond conventional symmetries to create an organic, asymmetrical composition.The watch’s design process is guided by parametric and computational methodologies, generating forms that evolve beyond manually sketched concepts. The skeletonized dial consists of three superimposed layers, each shaped through algorithmic calculations and refined through precise machining. The interplay of angles and facets enhances depth and contrast by capturing and reflecting light dynamically.all images courtesy of Mauron Musy and Arturo TedeschiMU05-106 ARCHITECT features an asymmetrical skeletonized dialEncased in a 44mm housing, the MU05-106 ARCHITECT, designed by watch engineers at Mauron Musy and architect Arturo Tedeschi, features the skeletonized MM01-SK movement, framed by a dial with multiple finishes. Polished, satin-finished, beveled, sunray-brushed, and grained surfaces contribute to a varied interplay of textures.

The MU05-106 ARCHITECT represents an intersection of algorithmic design and Swiss watchmaking, demonstrating an approach where computational processes contribute to both visual complexity and mechanical functionality.MU05-106 ARCHITECT merges computational design with Swiss watchmakingan asymmetrical skeleton dial generated through algorithmic designMauron Musy and Arturo Tedeschi explore new forms in watch architecturethree superimposed layers create depth and dynamic light reflectionsprecision machining refines algorithmically generated forms",
