  "text": "I like collecting all kinds of stationery and office supplies stuff so I’m always on the look out for those that are cute and/or well-designed. I may not always have enough space on both my home and office work space but since I also get easily bored with my desk set up, I always like having something that I can easily replace or re-use. Modular designs are always interesting since you can change it if ever you want something new on your table. Designer: Teixeria Design Studio Track is a concept for a modular tray that fits into this category. If your mood or aesthetic is wood and minimalist, then this would be perfect. It is made out of solid wood and has different parts that you can move around and arrange depending on what you need and the amount of space that you have on your working area. The tray has three different pocket lines that you can arrange and re-arrange and put certain stationery items like pins, pens, staple wires, cutters, and various other items that you can fit into these lines. There is also a “center opening” where you can place things like a thin smartphone, sticky notes, and other items that you can place upright vertically. There seem to be three different ways you can re-arrange the different pieces. They are CNC milled and finished by hand. It’s pretty minimalist but the way you can re-arrange it is of course the appeal, aside from actually helping you declutter your desk.",
