  "text": "Handheld gaming continues to evolve, but few devices manage to push boundaries quite like AYANEO’s new Flip 1S DS. With its bold dual-screen design, premium internals, and productivity-focused features, it presents a compelling alternative in a crowded field, one that could shift expectations for what a portable PC gaming experience can deliver. AYANEO’s latest device, the Flip 1S DS, elevates its dual‑screen handheld concept first seen with the Flip DS, which itself is a bold reinterpretation of Nintendo’s clamshell design. That earlier model, inspired by a different Nintendo star, introduced the novelty of two intimate screens combined with a controller layout reminiscent of classic gaming systems. The new Flip 1S DS retains this nostalgic form but adds serious high-end specs to the equation. Designer: Ayaneo Central to the clampshell gadget is a 7-inch OLED primary display offering 1080p resolution (aspect ratio of 16:9), a rapid 144 Hz refresh rate, and peak brightness around 800 nits. A secondary 4.5-inch IPS screen with 1620×1080 resolution and a 3:2 aspect ratio enhances multitasking and retro-gaming scenarios. Color accuracy and visual clarity appear well‑balanced for both gaming immersion and productivity tasks. Performance improvements are considerable with the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 APU, the Flip 1S DS delivers a twelve-core, twenty‑four‑thread setup with clocks up to 5.1 GHz. That places it ahead of the eight-core Ryzen Z2 Extreme used in ASUS’s upcoming ROG Xbox Ally X. Users should experience robust performance across demanding AAA titles and seamless multitasking, and built-in AI helps balance power and efficiency. Thermal management is handled via a hybrid cooling assembly featuring both a vapor chamber and active fan system, engineered to sustain performance and prevent throttling during intense sessions. AYANEO also deploys its custom AYASpace 3.0 interface, improving usability with quick controls, performance profiles, and a “Snowfield” toggle for transitioning between desktop and gaming environments. The physical design uses CNC-machined metal, offering structural solidity and a refined aesthetic. An ergonomic stepless hinge supports versatile viewing angles, and controller inputs include stick drift-resistant TMR joysticks and tactile buttons suited for extended play. An optical finger mouse embedded in the bottom screen enhances cursor control in Windows, facilitating navigation without attaching external peripherals. Storage and memory options remain flexible, likely starting at 512 GB of M.2 SSD (2230 form factor) with user-replaceable expansion possibilities. AYANEO also ensures battery longevity, with a module in the 11,600 mAh range, comparable to other premium handhelds. Comparing this to the ROG Xbox Ally X, the Flip 1S DS leverages a more capable chipset and a dual‑screen configuration that may appeal to retro and multitask‑centric gamers. The Ally X, meanwhile, offers broader console and PC ecosystem access, strong ergonomics, and native Xbox branding, though some early impressions indicate it may feel heavy after prolonged use. Windows 11-powered AYANEO’s Flip 1S DS promises to be a technically impressive and thoughtfully designed handheld. While pricing remains unconfirmed, this niche‑focused evolution of the Flip series blends nostalgic dual‑screen design with the closely knit software and hardware integration. It will likely resonate with gamers seeking more than raw power – those wanting a playful, flexible, portable PC that recalls past handheld glories while pushing boundaries of performance, which power users will love.",
