It's so nice to have items crossed off your list before you even start. This new Amazon prime membership for ages 18-24 would make a great graduation or start of college gift! It's half the cost of regular memberships. Now the fun stuff! First up, these handy touch up paint pens! These are fantastic and make it so easy to touch up scuff marks and small drywall fixes:They come with four in the set and are easy to fill up. You push the button at the bottom of the pen to push the paint up into the brush. So handy! I keep them in our junk drawer for easy access. I noticed it was getting harder for me to see the detail in the puzzle pieces without my glasses (I'm getting old!!) so this thing is awesome! Plus the light is a game changer. They slide into the bottom of your oven (check to make sure yours will work with these) and last forever! I wash mine and reuse them over and over. I've shared this cleaning brush for your disposal before, but it's a great one and worth sharing again. If you've ever noticed a stink coming from your disposal that won't go away, this will probably help:   It allows you to safely clean around the blades, but also cleans the underside of the rubber sink drain as well. SO nasty! This brush is great -- we use it every other week or so. A fabric shaver is a must for clothing -- I use them often to get little fuzz balls off of my clothing. But these are also so helpful for upholstery as well: This cordless fabric shaver is great to have around the house, especially if you have animals! I was able to easily remove those snags on the chair with a few swipes. This one shows you how much charge is left (the LED was glitching for the camera, mine was at 83 percent) and has three power levels. This defuzzer tool is AWESOME, and another great idea for a pet owner. I use it on upholstery and fabric that doesn't clean up as well with my Chom Chom or a vacuum: This thing is especially helpful in the car -- you know those fuzzies that will not come out the carpet? This rakes them right up and makes it so easy. My picture is underwhelming, I know. I had just cleaned this up a few weeks ago. It works SO well with stubborn pet fur, lint and fuzz around the house. I don't know how I came across these laundry sheets, but I'm completely hooked now: The sheets are perforated -- for large loads we use two, for smaller just one section. They dissolve well (put them in the washer before your clothing) and are WAY less messy than liquid or powder detergent. If you're short on space in your laundry area, they take up WAY less space as well!: They are silky smooth and the paint goes on like butter. The tips are shaped in a way that makes it so much easier to get paint into detailed areas. And a little detail -- but I like the longer handles as well. It's great for coupons and photos, but I use them for our monthly receipts. If you need to keep track of paper receipts for tax purposes, this is so helpful! This organizer would be awesome for photos as well -- it holds a ton! When I made some minor changes to my closet this year, I picked up these space saving double hanger doodads and was surprised at how handy they are: You get a TON -- 20 hooks! I don't know if I'd necessarily say they are super space saving, as you are still going to have two items hanging, but they are quite handy to keep clothing sets together. My husband is going to try them out on his suits as well. They are super sturdy and will hold a lot of weight. I used this decorative window film on the glass on our upper cabinets in the kitchen. I LOVE the film and the way it looks -- but it's a bit busy looking with our backsplash tile and grout. We decided to live with it for a while to see what we think. This window cling would be another pretty option for making windows private for super cheap!It was so easy to apply and makes for a very inexpensive DIY update. We hosted our son's graduation party earlier this summer and I spent weeks sprucing up the back patio in preparation. I was thrilled to find this large striped outdoor rug for only $25 on Facebook Marketplace the week before!: It was in wonderful condition, but the edges were a bit thick and would curl up. I was terrified someone would trip on it. Thankfully I found this carpet tape that works on concrete. The tape works so well! In really hot weather the edges sometimes creep up a bit, but we just have to step on it and they are secure again. After the first batch of tissues were out, I tried refilling with a stack of Kleenex, but it never fit just right. I happened upon these tissue refills for made just for this holder, but also love them for having for travel, the beach bag, whatever: They have extra large sizes for giant photos or art, but the 4x6, 5x7 and 8.5x11 albums are all under $10 and each holds 48 flat items. I love seeing what other family's find handy to have around the house, so I hope this was helpful!",
