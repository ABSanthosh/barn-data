As an example, here's a Land Rover Defender from the firm:It's like they're trying to port the vehicle into an anime movie, or increase the rendering cost by adding extra surfaces purely for the sake of it. Despite the hackneyed attempt, you can at least still make out the original lines and gesture of the Defender, as the vehicle's underlying design is sound, aesthetically speaking.However, this more-is-more approach breaks down with their take on the Tesla Cybertruck: Their goal in tacking these extra parts on was to \"push the martial appearance of the vehicle a little further into the extreme,\" the firm says, which is presumably what Dubai-based millionaires are looking for. If anything, however, I think the add-ons merely highlight the awful underlying form of the truck. The more I look at it, the more it looks like it was designed in a single afternoon by someone with no design training.Even more cringeworthy: This vehicle modification is called the \"Elongation\" (italics ours).",
