  "text": "Thanks for stopping by for this week’s Style Scouting. My Sunday post where I share the random stuff that captured my attention or inspired me that I found online. This weekend summer arrived in the northern hemisphere. With it came a major heat wave that is affecting large swaths of the U.S, including where I live where it is very hot and may even reach triple digits! Ed had shoulder replacement surgery on Friday, so I spent the last two days hanging out in a very nice hospital with lots of large windows to sit by to take in the views. Ed came home yesterday. He is doing great and just dealing with the pain now and having to wear a sling for the next 4 weeks. I have passed along the well-wishes many of you sent him. XO. For the next few days I will be staying close to home to make sure he has all he needs. I will be working on a few posts for the summer while also taking time to simply enjoy reading a few good books I have on my Kindle. I hope you can stay inside in the cool AC. Keep yourself safe and stay cool however you can this week and if you can, find your way to some water — a pool, lake, river, ocean or a fun run through a lawn sprinkler like we did when we were kids to cool off. :-) Now onto the links I found for you this week. Watching \u0026 Reading I am totally immersed in the 2015 NBC crime drama, Blindspot that is currently on Netflix. The storyline is great and I also like that there are no dark gritty video filters on the scenes like so many crime dramas and movies have on them nowadays.
