When used correctly, mirrors can enhance natural light, expand spaces, and attract positive energy, but improper placement can make a room feel awkward, stilted, and full of bad vibes. Understanding the principles of mirror placement according to Feng Shui can help you harness that power to improve your home’s energy. Here are a few tips from Feng Shui principles that should help sort out where best to put your mirrors in every room. Mirrors in the Entryway The entryway is the first impression of your home, making it an important area for Feng Shui considerations. Experts advise placing mirrors thoughtfully in this space to welcome positive energy and create a sense of openness. A mirror positioned opposite the front door is generally discouraged, as it can reflect energy back out of the home, preventing it from circulating. Instead, place mirrors on side walls to expand the space and invite energy to flow smoothly. This also helps make the room feel brighter and thus more welcoming.

Experts recommend placing mirrors opposite windows to reflect light and brighten the room (while also bringing the beauty of the outdoors further into the room). However, it’s important to avoid placing mirrors where they reflect clutter or sharp angles, as this can create a sense of chaos. Instead, use mirrors to highlight positive elements, such as artwork or a beautiful view. Large mirrors can also be used to visually expand the room, making it feel more open.

According to Feng Shui experts, mirrors should not directly face the bed, as this can disrupt sleep by reflecting energy and movement, creating restlessness. Instead, place mirrors where they do not reflect the bed, such as on a side wall or inside a closet door. This helps maintain a peaceful atmosphere conducive to restful sleep. Bedroom mirrors are less about creating space and more about the balance between functionality and keeping the space feeling peaceful, which you can do by keeping mirrors only where you need to use them (near closets, clothing, or vanities).

Experts suggest placing a mirror to reflect the dining table, symbolizing the doubling of food and wealth. However, the space the mirror reflects must be clean and clear, as reflections of clutter can create a sense of chaos. This is also the mirror that you want to match your decor the most, especially if it’s large, since jarring changes in style can make something as simple as eating dinner feel off in a way. Pick a mirror that compliments the size of the table you’re hoping to reflect to get the best effect.

Experts recommend avoiding mirrors that reflect the toilet, as this can symbolize flushing away energy and wealth (people also generally don’t like seeing themselves in that position, let’s face it). Of course, most bathroom mirrors hang above the sink, so try to utilize that placement to reflect something nice like a piece of art or a shelf with plants on it. Try not to have mirrors reflecting the bathroom door as that can make an already usually small space feel even smaller. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / tampatra Mirrors are powerful tools in Feng Shui, capable of transforming the energy in your home. By understanding and applying these mirror placement tips, you can create a more open, free-flowing space that just feels brighter. Whether improving light in the living room, ensuring restful sleep in the bedroom, or reflecting abundance in the dining room, mirrors can be strategically placed to benefit each space.

Experts recommend avoiding mirrors that reflect the toilet, as this can symbolize flushing away energy and wealth (people also generally don’t like seeing themselves in that position, let’s face it). Of course, most bathroom mirrors hang above the sink, so try to utilize that placement to reflect something nice like a piece of art or a shelf with plants on it. Try not to have mirrors reflecting the bathroom door as that can make an already usually small space feel even smaller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_266294\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-266294\"\u003e            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/public-toilet-restroom-in-restaurant-or-shopping-2024-10-21-09-29-08-utc-59852-scaled.jpg?width=480\" media=\"(max-width: 481px)\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1872\"/\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/public-toilet-restroom-in-restaurant-or-shopping-2024-10-21-09-29-08-utc-59852-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Row of modern marble ceramic wash basin in public toilet, restroom in restaurant or hotel or shopping mall, interior decoration design\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1872\" srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/public-toilet-restroom-in-restaurant-or-shopping-2024-10-21-09-29-08-utc-59852-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/public-toilet-restroom-in-restaurant-or-shopping-2024-10-21-09-29-08-utc-59852-246x180.jpg 246w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/public-toilet-restroom-in-restaurant-or-shopping-2024-10-21-09-29-08-utc-59852-600x439.jpg 600w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/public-toilet-restroom-in-restaurant-or-shopping-2024-10-21-09-29-08-utc-59852-768x562.jpg 768w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/public-toilet-restroom-in-restaurant-or-shopping-2024-10-21-09-29-08-utc-59852-1536x1123.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/public-toilet-restroom-in-restaurant-or-shopping-2024-10-21-09-29-08-utc-59852-2048x1498.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/public-toilet-restroom-in-restaurant-or-shopping-2024-10-21-09-29-08-utc-59852-385x282.jpg 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"/\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\n                \n                \n            \u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-266294\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://elements.envato.com/public-toilet-restroom-in-restaurant-or-shopping-m-2WCSHVB\"\u003ePhoto Credit: Envato Elements / tampatra\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMirrors are powerful tools in Feng Shui, capable of transforming the energy in your home.
