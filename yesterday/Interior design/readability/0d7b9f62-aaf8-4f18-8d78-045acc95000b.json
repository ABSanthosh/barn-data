  "description": "The brief behind this barn-turned-holiday-home on NSW’s South Coast was all about ‘modern-day country style’. Originally used as a stable, the building features all the staples of a classic barn: the sliding doors, gabled roof, and exposed beams. But a renovation by Lot 1 design has bought a refined edge to the previously rustic abode.",

  "text": "Once a horse stable, this reimagined barn has been given a new lease on life as a surprisingly polished holiday home about 10 minutes south of Berry, NSW. The barn had already been converted into accommodation by the previous owner when Lot 1 design’s clients purchased the property about six years ago. Their goal was to turn the weatherboard-clad dwelling’s somewhat ‘makeshift’ interiors into a cohesive, self-contained guest house for family and friends, with a full kitchen and laundry, dining, living, bathroom and storage — all neatly packed into 83 square metres. ‘The central challenge was fitting all these elements into the relatively small structure, whilst making it feel inviting and expansive,’ Lot 1 design principal designer Tammy Miconi says. ‘Our approach was to counteract the low ceiling height and open up the interior by inserting a large void, which draws the eye up immediately upon entry, emphasising the double height from ground level to the top of the pitched ceiling.’ The two levels are now connected by a new central spiral staircase, leading to the two bedrooms upstairs, with enough room for eight guests. Meanwhile on the ground floor, the sliding barn doors open to reveal the airy living room beneath the void, as the galley kitchen with pocket-door joinery help minimise clutter and maximise space. The overall style that informed almost every design decision was ‘modern-day country’. This meant balancing the barn’s original rustic typology and homestead setting with more contemporary flair. Exposed beams and ceiling trusses, previously orange in colour, were stained and oiled. The new dark timber finish contrasts with the creams and white tones of the light and bright lower level, framing the entire interior. ‘Existing hardwood flooring, neutral coloured concrete, organic brass tapware, sisal carpets, and linen curtains create a sense of warmth and genteel luxury, complemented by soft browns, greys and earthy greens with a touch of pale peach — inspired by the surrounding landscape,’ Tammy says. The resulting barn feels like a refreshing and refined take on traditional farmhouse styling, yet settled into its country surrounds. And best of all, it’s got all the amenities the owners need to make memories together for years to come.",
