When Lenovo introduced its second-generation foldable PC last year, it represented the pinnacle of what was possible in this emerging category. The device combined a versatile 16.3-inch OLED display with robust engineering and the familiar Windows ecosystem. It set benchmarks for build quality, display technology, and adaptability that competitors would need to surpass. Designer: Lenovo Designer: Huawei Fast forward to today, and the landscape has shifted dramatically. Huawei has unveiled its MateBook Fold Ultimate Design, a device that challenges our understanding of what foldable laptops can achieve. With an 18-inch display that folds to a 13-inch form factor, a chassis measuring just 7.3mm when open, and a proprietary operating system built specifically for foldable hardware, Huawei has raised the stakes considerably. This comparison arrives at a pivotal moment for foldable computing. The category has matured beyond proof-of-concept to deliver genuinely useful productivity tools. Now that we have seen what Lenovo accomplished with the X1 Fold 2024, let us examine how Huawei’s MateBook Fold Ultimate Design responds and potentially redefines the future of portable computing. Design Philosophy and Physical Presence The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold 2024 embodies the ThinkPad ethos of reliability and purposeful design. Its magnesium alloy frame and recycled PET woven fabric cover create a device that feels substantial and durable. The fold-flat hinge eliminates gaps when closed, protecting the display while maintaining a clean profile. At 8.6mm when open and 17.4mm when closed, the X1 Fold is not the thinnest laptop available, but its construction inspires confidence. The device weighs approximately 2.9 pounds without accessories, increasing to 4.3 pounds with the keyboard and stand attached. This weight reflects Lenovo’s prioritization of durability over absolute portability. Huawei takes a dramatically different approach with the MateBook Fold Ultimate Design. The device measures an astonishing 7.3mm when open and 14.9mm when closed, making it significantly thinner than the X1 Fold. At just 1.16kg (2.56 pounds) for the base unit and 1.45kg with the keyboard, the MateBook Fold is remarkably light for a device with an 18-inch display. This achievement comes from Huawei’s use of carbon fiber reinforcement and a zirconium-based liquid metal hinge. The 285mm “water-drop” hinge design provides smooth folding action and increased durability, with Huawei claiming a 400% improvement in hovering torque compared to conventional designs. The most significant physical difference between these devices becomes apparent in their approach to accessories. Lenovo requires a separate kickstand for desk use, adding bulk and complexity to the overall package. Huawei integrates a sturdy kickstand directly into the MateBook Fold, eliminating the need for additional accessories and streamlining the user experience. This built-in solution allows for more versatile positioning and reduces the number of components users need to manage. Both devices transform between multiple modes, but their physical dimensions create distinct experiences. When folded, the X1 Fold becomes a 12-inch laptop, which many users find cramped for serious multitasking. The MateBook Fold offers a more generous 13-inch workspace in laptop mode, providing additional screen real estate for productivity tasks. This difference may seem small on paper, but it significantly impacts the practical usability of these devices in their folded configurations. The materials chosen for each device reveal different priorities. Lenovo emphasizes sustainability with its recycled PET fabric cover and plastic-free packaging. This approach aligns with growing corporate environmental concerns and provides a tactile warmth that distinguishes the X1 Fold from typical metal-clad laptops. Huawei focuses on premium materials that enable extreme thinness, using advanced alloys and composites throughout the chassis. Both approaches result in distinctive aesthetics that will appeal to different user preferences. Display Technology and Visual Experience Display technology represents the heart of any foldable device, and both manufacturers have made significant investments in this critical component. The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold features a 16.3-inch OLED panel with a resolution of 2560 x 2024 and a 4:3 aspect ratio. This display delivers 400 nits of brightness for standard content, increasing to 600 nits for HDR material. The panel supports DisplayHDR True Black 600 certification and Dolby Vision, covering 100% of the DCI-P3 color gamut. An anti-smudge coating helps maintain visual clarity during extended use. Huawei pushes display technology further with the MateBook Fold Ultimate Design. Its 18-inch LTPO OLED screen boasts a resolution of 3296 x 2472, maintaining the same 4:3 aspect ratio as the Lenovo. However, the MateBook Fold achieves a peak brightness of 1600 nits, more than double that of the X1 Fold. The dual-layer LTPO technology reduces power consumption by 30% compared to standard OLED panels while supporting adaptive refresh rates from 1Hz to 120Hz. This combination of size, brightness, and efficiency creates a visual experience that surpasses the X1 Fold in nearly every measurable aspect. Both displays exhibit a visible crease at the fold, though the severity varies. Lenovo’s hinge design minimizes the crease when the device is fully open, but it becomes more noticeable at certain viewing angles. Huawei claims its water-drop hinge reduces crease visibility, though independent verification is limited. In practical use, both creases become less distracting over time as users adapt to the form factor. Color accuracy and visual impact favor the MateBook Fold, with its higher brightness and contrast ratio of 2,000,000:1 creating more vibrant images and videos. The X1 Fold delivers excellent color reproduction but cannot match the visual punch of Huawei’s display. For creative professionals and media consumers, this difference could be decisive when choosing between these devices. The touch response and pen input capabilities of both displays deserve consideration. Lenovo’s display works seamlessly with the Precision Pen, offering pressure sensitivity that makes note-taking and sketching feel natural. The anti-smudge coating balances fingerprint resistance with smooth touch response. Huawei provides similar functionality, though detailed specifications about pressure sensitivity levels and palm rejection capabilities are not yet widely available. Both devices support multi-touch gestures for navigation and manipulation of on-screen elements. The 4:3 aspect ratio on both devices proves ideal for productivity applications, providing more vertical space than typical 16:9 laptop displays. This ratio works particularly well for document editing, web browsing, and coding. When watching widescreen video content, both devices display black bars at the top and bottom, but the overall screen size still delivers an immersive viewing experience, especially on the larger MateBook Fold. Performance and Hardware Capabilities The performance profiles of these devices reflect their different design philosophies. Lenovo equips the ThinkPad X1 Fold with 12th Generation Intel processors, ranging from the Core i5-1230U to the Core i7-1260U vPro.
