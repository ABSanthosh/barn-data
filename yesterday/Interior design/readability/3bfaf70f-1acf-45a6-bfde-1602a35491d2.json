  "text": "New York-based designer Billy Cotton has blended art deco, futurist and brutalist references inside this restaurant in Lower Manhattan. For the first restaurant interior in his two-decade career, Cotton has designed Bridges as an homage to lively Parisian bistros while including plenty of \"New York character\". Banquettes built from cherry wood and featuring black leather cushions surround the main dining room at Bridges\"The space blends art deco history with a more innovative futurist edge, creating an atmosphere with all the old school charm of so many classic Parisian and New York restaurants — but with a decidedly memorable, new-age twist,\" said the restaurant team. Named for its Chinatown location between the entrances to the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges, the French-Basque restaurant is owned by chef Sam Lawrence and operator Nicolas Mouchel, with creative direction by Josephine Stuart. The warm cherry wood pops against the white tableclothsGlass-block partitions around the entrance vestibule are influenced by the geometry of the nearby brutalist development Chatham Towers by Japanese-American architect George Shimamoto. A gap in the translucent blockwork leads to the bar, which is formed almost entirely of cherry wood and features curved edge detailing. Glass-block partitions reference the nearby brutalist Chatham TowersOpposite, a pair of booths built from the same wood variety and topped with black leather cushions are nestled against the textured concrete wall. Another glass-block partition demarcates the entrance to the 50-seat main dining area, where black leather upholstery is repeated across the banquettes that run along the walls. Here, textured, minimal wallpaper by Gracie Studios echoes the textured concrete of the front. Polished concrete floors throughout the space are inlaid with vibrant red tile, playing off the warm tones of the wood that pop against the white tablecloths. Bridges also includes a private dining room that seats 10 to 14 covers, with an additional 12 spots available in the bar area. The wood bar features art deco detailsThe 2,300-square-foot (214-square-metre) restaurant is illuminated by chrome light fixtures, some of which are vintage and others sourced from locally based studio Blue Green Works. These \"play against the overall design schema of the space to create both a unique and cohesive dining experience\" according to the team. Chrome-finished lighting fixtures include sconces by local studio Blue Green Works, which illuminate booths in the bar areaOther relative newcomers to New York City's culinary scene include San Sabino in the West Village and Cecchis in Chelsea. We recently published a round-up of nine design-forward eateries in the city, which includes Italian-influenced Cucina Alba, Korean spot Oiji Mi and fried-chicken specialist Coqodaq.
