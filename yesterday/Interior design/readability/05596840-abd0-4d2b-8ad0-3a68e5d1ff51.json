  "text": "Classic cars often become platforms for bold customization, but few reimaginings are as visually striking (or ugly, I have to admit) as this one. Italian mechanic Andrea Marazzi has transformed a 1993 Fiat Panda into what is now being described as the world’s narrowest functioning car. At just 19.6 inches wide, the one-seater electric vehicle looks more like a cartoon sketch brought to life than a road-ready hatchback. Yet it can move, steer, stop, and drive like any other car. That said, I would never imagine myself driving this one-eyed Cyclops in this lifetime. Marazzi, who works at his family’s scrapyard and mechanical workshop in Bagnolo Cremasco, spent over a year building the vehicle as a tribute to the original Fiat Panda. Nearly every original part of the 1993 car has been reused in the process—doors, lights, roof, and wheels—but the body has been split vertically and rebuilt to shrink the vehicle’s width down to a comically slim profile. What was once a compact city car is now a sculptural slice of steel with just enough room to accommodate a single person, seated at the exact center. Designer: Andrea Marazzi Powering this narrow Panda is a small electric motor borrowed from an e-scooter, paired with a 24V battery that gives the car a modest top speed of about 15 kilometers per hour and a driving range of approximately 25 kilometers. It’s not built for real-world commuting, nor is it legally road-registered. But it functions exactly as a basic car should: offering forward and reverse drive, braking, turning, and a working headlight and turn signals. While Marazzi originally created it as a showpiece, the vehicle is fully operational and was recently driven in public at an enthusiast gathering in Pandino, Italy. The car made its debut at “Panda a Pandino,” a festival celebrating 45 years of the Fiat Panda. Surrounded by thousands of conventionally sized Pandas, Marazzi’s single-seater stood out immediately. Videos and images from the event quickly went viral online, leaving viewers fascinated by its proportions and mobility. Many were amused by how the Panda looks almost flattened, as if it had been squeezed into a 2D shape while retaining its ability to move. Others praised the engineering behind it, describing it as a brilliant blend of creativity, nostalgia, and humor. Though it’s not street-legal, Marazzi is in the process of submitting the car for a Guinness World Record as the slimmest functioning vehicle ever made. At just a third of the width of the original Fiat Panda, it’s an extreme but fascinating reinterpretation of automotive form. More art installation than transport solution, the narrow Panda invites viewers to rethink proportions, functionality, and playfulness in mechanical design. It’s a rolling experiment—part engineering challenge, part tribute, and part public spectacle.",
