But the truth is, a well-designed space isn’t about following rules or doing certain particular things, it’s about understanding what works for you and making smart decisions along the way. Here are seven insider secrets to guide you through the process, from the early planning stages to the finishing touches. 1. Define the Purpose Before Anything Else Before picking colors or furniture, you need to fully understand what the space will be used for. A living room meant for entertaining will look different from one designed for quiet evenings, for example. Think about more than just the primary function too. A living room might be intended as an entertaining space, but will you also sometimes use it as a work space, or will your kids be playing in there? When you have a clear idea of all of the room’s purposes, it’s easier to make design choices that actually support your lifestyle rather than just looking good in pictures.

Collect images, textures, colors, and styles that you like. Save all of them together and start to layer them on top of one another to see what combinations work. Don’t just copy Pinterest trends, though. Pay attention to what consistently catches your eye, whether it’s warm wood tones, rich fabrics, or a specific color palette. This step helps you avoid impulsive choices and ensures everything works together cohesively along the way. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / FollowTheFlowStudio 3. Think About Flow A beautiful space is useless if it feels awkward to navigate. Consider how you move through the space. Are there awkward gaps? Do doors swing into furniture? Do you have to make a lot of turns to get around things? Make sure the foot traffic pathways are clear. Optimizing your layout might mean getting rid of something, but it’s usually worth it, as the space foes more for the room than another cramped object. If something feels “off” when you walk into a space, it probably is. Trust that instinct. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / pro_creator 4. Choose Key Pieces First Start with the biggest, most important pieces like the sofa, bed, or dining table before worrying about smaller decor. These items set the tone and take up the most visual space. They’re what solidifies your style and gives you a central piece to focus the rest of your decor on. Starting with smaller items might leave you with a larger selection, but they’re also more likely to be disorganized or mismatched. It’s harder to match one sofa to five different decor pieces than it is to match five decor pieces to one sofa. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / Lazy_Bear 5. Don’t Rush the Process Good design takes time. It’s tempting to finish everything quickly, wanting to see the room finally come together, but rushed choices often lead to regrets. Live in the space for a bit before making big commitments. Test paint colors on the wall at different times of day. Sit with furniture arrangements before deciding on the final layout. The more time you give yourself to adjust and tweak, the more natural and well-thought-out your space will feel once it’s done. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / zamrznutitonovi 6. Edit Ruthlessly and Keep It Personal One of the biggest mistakes in design is adding too much. Before you buy anything new, ask yourself if it adds to the function or feel of the room, and if not, skip it. Make sure your space reflects who you are by displaying items with meaning, not just ones that fit a trend. There’s an argument to be made for styles like maximalism, where having an overload of items is the point, but that’s still intentional and selective in its curation. Don’t just look for new items for the sake of it, have a goal in mind! Photo Credit: Envato Elements / Rawpixel The best-designed spaces aren’t just pretty. They work well, feel good, and reflect the people who live in them. By taking your time, making thoughtful choices, and focusing on function as much as style, you’ll create a space that truly feels like home. Whether you’re starting from scratch or refreshing a room, design with confidence from start to finish and let your style shine through.

Edit Ruthlessly and Keep It Personal\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the biggest mistakes in design is adding too much. Before you buy anything new, ask yourself if it adds to the function or feel of the room, and if not, skip it. Make sure your space reflects who you are by displaying items with meaning, not just ones that fit a trend. There’s an argument to be made for styles like maximalism, where having an overload of items is the point, but that’s still intentional and selective in its curation. Don’t just look for new items for the sake of it, have a goal in mind!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_266763\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-266763\"\u003e            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/mid-century-modern-decorated-loft-style-apartment-2023-11-27-04-55-58-utc-min-50557-scaled.jpg?width=480\" media=\"(max-width: 481px)\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\"/\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/mid-century-modern-decorated-loft-style-apartment-2023-11-27-04-55-58-utc-min-50557-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"A mid-century modern sideboard with a record player.\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/mid-century-modern-decorated-loft-style-apartment-2023-11-27-04-55-58-utc-min-50557-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/mid-century-modern-decorated-loft-style-apartment-2023-11-27-04-55-58-utc-min-50557-270x180.jpg 270w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/mid-century-modern-decorated-loft-style-apartment-2023-11-27-04-55-58-utc-min-50557-923x615.jpg 923w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/mid-century-modern-decorated-loft-style-apartment-2023-11-27-04-55-58-utc-min-50557-768x513.jpg 768w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/mid-century-modern-decorated-loft-style-apartment-2023-11-27-04-55-58-utc-min-50557-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/mid-century-modern-decorated-loft-style-apartment-2023-11-27-04-55-58-utc-min-50557-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/mid-century-modern-decorated-loft-style-apartment-2023-11-27-04-55-58-utc-min-50557-385x257.jpg 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"/\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\n                \n                \n            \u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-266763\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://elements.envato.com/mid-century-modern-decorated-loft-style-apartment-X3M7NZM\"\u003ePhoto Credit: Envato Elements / Rawpixel\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best-designed spaces aren’t just pretty.
