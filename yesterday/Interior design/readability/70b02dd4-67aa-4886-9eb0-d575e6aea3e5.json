  "text": "Most of the time, when I’m sitting on a chair, I’m doing one of three things: working on my macbook, watching a video on my tablet, or reading a book. There are of course a lot of chairs that cater to any or all of these activities, but what if a chair also wants to be a bookmark for whatever reading material it is that you’re devouring? Well, of course that depends on how you feel about furniture being used as a marker for your book, but this is an interesting kind of idea for a chair. The Verse 3D Printed Chair by Liam de la Bedoyere is a compelling fusion of functional design and poetic symbolism. This chair exemplifies how additive manufacturing can transcend traditional furniture design, offering both ergonomic support and a narrative element. The Verse chair features a gracefully curved seat designed for ergonomic comfort. Beneath the seat lies a distinctive sharp-angled structure that serves a dual purpose: it provides structural support and functions as a clever bookmark, holding your place in a book as you pause. This thoughtful integration makes the chair not just a piece of furniture but a companion in storytelling. Designer: Liam de la Bedoyere The name “Verse” reflects both the layered, line-by-line nature of 3D printing and the chair’s V-shaped form. It’s a nod to the poetic inspiration behind its creation, embodying the idea of a verse in a poem and the physical layers built during the printing process. The chair’s design marries form and function seamlessly. Its minimalist aesthetic is accentuated by the clean lines and the interplay of curves and angles. The use of 3D printing allows for precise construction, ensuring both stability and comfort. The sharp-angled base not only provides a unique visual appeal but also reinforces the chair’s structural integrity. While specific materials are not detailed, the chair’s 3D-printed nature suggests the use of durable polymers commonly employed in additive manufacturing. This method allows for intricate designs and efficient production, aligning with sustainable practices by minimizing waste and enabling the use of recyclable materials. This stands as a testament to innovative design thinking, where functionality meets storytelling. This concept not only offers a comfortable seating solution but also enriches the user’s experience by integrating a literary element. It’s a piece that invites users to sit, relax, and immerse themselves in their favorite stories, with the chair itself becoming a part of the narrative.",
