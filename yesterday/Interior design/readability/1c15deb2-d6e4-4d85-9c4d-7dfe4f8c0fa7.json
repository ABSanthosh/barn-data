  "description": "A derelict, heritage-protected house is not high on many people’s ‘dream home’ wishlists, unless they have the vision and skill of architect Natasha Nardella and builder Joshua Best. The couple have fully restored the facade of their 1890s worker’s cottage, while a new contemporary addition pays homage to former brickworks in the area.",

  "text": "Many of Melbourne’s original inner-city period  homes are just waiting for the right buyer to restore their original features. This 1890s worker’s cottage in Brunswick West was not one of those homes. Far from a quick fixer-upper, this home was almost entirely beyond repair. Its walls were covered with cracks, and there was significant mould damage throughout. A heritage overlay required someone with fantastic vision, time, skill, and patience to realise the building’s potential as a warm and generous home. The house couldn’t have fallen into better hands than architect Natasha Nardella of Nardel Architects and builder Joshua Best of Jobe Homes, who purchased the property in 2021. They began work on the project right away, aiming to complete a renovation and addition in record time. ‘It was organised chaos, with almost all selections and finishes being made on the go,’ says Natasha. ‘We chose to do it this way so we could expedite the initial phases of design/documentation and therefore get started on site ASAP.’ Natasha designed a contemporary two storey brick addition that pays homage to Brunswick’s history as a brickworks hotspot. At the local industry’s peak in the 1870s, there were 40 brickworks and potteries in the area, including the former Hoffman Brickworks located nearby (and partially still standing today). Bricks feature both inside and out, adding texture to the calm, minimal haven Natasha and Joshua have created away from Brunswick’s busy streets. Colour is only introduced through select furniture pieces and four large artworks hanging in the kitchen and dining area, including two paintings commissioned especially for the space. The rear addition is largely concealed from the street by an established tree in the neighbour’s front yard and the fully restored original facade featuring new roofing, decorative lacework, a timber window and picket fence in keeping with its 1890s design. After eight months of construction, Natasha and Joshua are happy in a home tailor-made for the experiences that bring joy and meaning to their lives: hosting friends; enjoying a drink in the sun, and listening to music in their dedicated record room. ‘I love sitting on the sofa with a coffee in hand, incense burning, and music playing softly in the background. I find it to be a super calming space, and my favourite place to unwind,’ says Natasha. The couple’s home is regularly shared with clients, who marvel at the space when meeting to discuss prospective projects by Nardel Architects and Jobe Homes. ‘We’ve also found ourselves surrounded by other creatives who we’ve since collaborated with including Beci Orpin, Jac And, Miniscapes, and Softer Studio,’ says Natasha. ‘It’s a really nice community to be part of.’",
