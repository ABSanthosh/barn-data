  "description": "This renovation designed by MYMYMY Architecture shows the potential of well-built, established apartments and townhouses as modern day family homes. Working entirely with the existing structural bones of the 1970s Canberra property, the architects were able to make the space more inspiring and generously proportioned with the injection of colour and a strategically placed kitchen island bench.

  "text": "The clients of this apartment renovation in Turner, ACT purchased the 1970s property when expecting their second child. They recognised the solid bones of the building — designed by architects Daryl Jackson and Evan Walker — and its potential to host modern family living with a few tweaks. The floor plan of the three-bedroom property didn’t need major modifications, just as well, says Mark Brook, director of MYMYMY Architecture, who designed the renovation. He explains, ‘All internal walls and floors were a combination of masonry and concrete meaning any adaptations were very difficult.’ This inflexible building structure and strict budget called for MYMYMY Architecture to consider alternatives. Most significantly, to navigate the poky and defined kitchen, the architects turned the existing kitchen into more of a butler’s pantry, while a new island bench with a cooktop and range hood was added to the living room next door. This move instantly created a kitchen with proportions in keeping with a luxury house, and forming a constant connection between residents in the kitchen and living room. Aesthetically, the clients loved the 1970s character of the interiors, but the bathrooms and joinery were tired. ‘The vision for the project was to create fresh and vibrant spaces — something that celebrated the existing building — retaining as much as we could, but also providing something new,’ says Mark. ‘We wanted to blend the new and existing so the line between what was original and what was added became hard to define.’ Key features such as the timber staircase and exposed brick wall were retained alongside new bathrooms and a kitchen that highlights bold colour. Warm and earthy shades (Laminex Moroccan Clay and Porter’s Paints Ochre) in the kitchen look pink when paired with a blush and peach terrazzo benchtop. The addition of Surround by Laminex Classic VJ wall panelling adds a slightly nostalgic feeling and simultaneously conceals cracking in the existing brickwork. The bathrooms continue the use of terrazzo with tiles in orangey-browns — a modern take on the 1970s materials in the original design. Without moving or removing any walls, the townhouse is now a functional and aspirational home for a family of four. ‘I am proud that our decision to retain and respect the existing building has made the apartment feel settled in its context. Walking into the apartment it feels like the design has always been in this building, but at the same time, it is brand new,’ says Mark. ‘I am also proud for what this means for the existing apartments in Canberra — that it is possible to refurbish this existing building stock without overcapitalising or demolishing what came before.’ The client, Ellen, echoes Mark’s thoughts. ‘I would say that we feel incredibly proud to have created a home that feels like us and to have restored our small part of a classic old Canberra apartment in an area surrounded by brand new huge apartment blocks,’ she says. ‘We hope more young families will follow suit and make these great bones into something special… Our four-year-old girl loves to tell everyone about her pink house!’",
