  "text": "luxury of less embodies bmw’s circular design philosophyBMW Middle East and AB+AC Architects mark their return to Dubai Design Week, teaming up to present Luxury of Less — a multi-sensorial pavilion that invites visitors into a meditative journey. Through a sequence of transformative thresholds, the pavilion reimagines luxury as minimalist, intentional, and rooted in well-being, inspired by BMW’s circular design ethos for a sustainable future. Its wooden cubed form then configures modular components in a construction approach akin to automotive components, manifesting BMW’s design language as an inhabitable space.Every element — from the structural framework to the translucent drapes and the inner paneling — recalls the comfort of the brand and can be disassembled, replaced, and reused. This aligns with BMW’s Re;duce, Re;use, Re;cycle, Re;think motto, creating a design that extends its lifecycle and reduces waste. ‘At AB+AC, we believe that this is what luxury will look like in the future — stripping away the unnecessary and focusing on meaningful and intentional choices that still reflect the best in quality and comfort,’ comments designer Arianna Bavuso. The pavilion was on view at Dubai Design District (d3), from November 5 to 10, 2024.all images courtesy of AB+AC Architectsab+ac architecture’s multisensorial pavilion seeks to comfortThe Luxury of Less pavilion offers an immersive, holistic experience, unfolding across layered spaces that merge design, nature, and well-being. Outside, visitors are introduced to the BMW iX, a sustainable vehicle crafted using 100% green hydroelectricity and recycled materials. AB+AC has draped the outer wooden framework in sapphire blue chiffon, symbolizing the connection between the earth and the sky, while within, a liminal space adorned with bright orange silk evokes the glow of a desert sunset. The journey concludes in an intimate central room designed to calm the senses where ecru Alcantara floor tiles mimick sand dunes, and walls are punctured for natural light and airflow. Minimalistic design elements such as a suspended scenographic mirror and a central tray with rose water are enhanced by sensory details like Tibetan bowls, distant crystal chimes, and warm lighting grids. The ambiance is further enhanced by a meditative performance, which along with the design elements seeks to comfort the human eye and calm the nervous system.BMW Middle East and AB+AC Architects return to Dubai Design Week 2024unveiled at dubai design weekGuided by the multidisciplinary practice’s expertise in neuro-architecture and the psychology of spaces, the pavilion is designed to induce a virtuous cycle of excitement, awe and reflection, based on the neuroscientific principles of ‘Curiosity, Anticipation, and Pleasure.’ Arianna Bavuso elaborates, ‘We have one million years of evolution to prove that our cellular biology is strongly tied to our surroundings, yet this is taken into consideration only marginally in the design of our cities and everyday spaces.’ By leveraging these insights, the pavilion fosters endorphin release, enhancing well-being and even cellular repair. a multi-sensorial pavilion that invites visitors into a meditative journeya translucent cube nests another moduleLuxury of Less reimagines luxury as minimalist, intentional, and rooted in well-beinga liminal space adorned with bright orange silk evokes the glow of a desert sunset",
