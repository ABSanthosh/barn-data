Because you'd have to try them on, to see for yourself how compelling or effective the visual effects really are. Without that experience, you're just looking at press images and guessing at how accurate they are. This month Chinese manufacturer Xreal released their new One and One Pro AR glasses. These feature Sony Micro-OLED screens and a built-in Bose sound system.
