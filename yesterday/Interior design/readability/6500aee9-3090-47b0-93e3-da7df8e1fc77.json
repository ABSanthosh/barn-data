  "description": "Perhaps this will one day be a common sight in hospitals and homes: That's Eve, the world's first self-balancing personal exoskeleton, according to French robotics company Wandercraft. Eve's mission is to restore walking independence to those with severe mobility issues. Once a user dons it, Eve allows them to stand and walk, with AI tackling the self-balancing. The company says it requires five training sessions to get the hang of. Eve caused a stir last year, when it was featured in the 2024 Summer Olympics Torch Relay in France. Paralympian Kevin Piette donned the exoskeleton to carry the torch through a village outside of Paris. The exoskeleton has made its way 'Stateside, where it's currently undergoing trials at the James J. Peters VA Medical Center in the Bronx and the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation in New Jersey. The trials allow adults with spinal cord injuries to walk again. The company says they still have regulatory hurdles to clear, but that pending further validation, they expect Eve to become commercially available.",
