  "description": "The Cross Street Flats in Carlton were designed in the early 1970s by Earle Shaw and Partners — a lesser-known but significant contemporary of Merchant Builders, Graeme Gunn, and other influential practices addressing Melbourne’s shortage of medium-density housing — with involvement from Australian architectural historian David Saunders. The project is still highly respected today by designers and residents, including architect and multiple housing leader at Wardle Jack Davies, and Aesop development manager Elizabeth White, who live in one of the apartments with their newborn son, Gus. They purchased their Cross Street apartment for its progressive design, described as the ‘first large-scale urban project in Australia that consciously articulated an understanding of its historic environment.’ With a $70,000 budget, Jack and Elizabeth have renovated the apartment (virtually untouched since the 1990s), while respecting the building’s architectural integrity.",

  "text": "Jack Davies and Elizabeth White are big advocates of small footprint living, having lived in apartments across Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Dubai, Perth, and now Melbourne. Jack also works in the field, as the multiple housing leader at architecture practice Wardle. Prior to the birth of their first child, Jack and Elizabeth purchased an apartment in the Cross Street Flats in Carlton. ‘Working within our budget, we are happy to compromise on certain elements such as extra space, to access a rich and varied inner-north lifestyle,’ says Jack. ‘We don’t have a car, and cycle most places with [our son] Gus on the back… Lizzie works at Aesop in Collingwood, and our commutes are through the Carlton Gardens and down Gertrude Street.’ The 1970s Carlton estate is architecturally notable as a large-scale urban project in Australia that consciously articulates an understanding of its historic environment, as championed by architectural historian David Saunders, who oversaw the project designed by Earle Shaw and Partners. Research funded by The University of Melbourne’s Hallmark Affordable Housing Initiative says the Carlton project demonstrates many of Saunders’s key urban ideas, such as the importance of the 19th-century terrace form and shared pedestrianised spaces. When Jack and Elizabeth purchased their apartment, the interiors were looking tired and not conducive to family living. Jack explains, ‘It had been the city bolthole for the previous owner and was in showroom 1999 condition. He barely used it.’ The apartment needed renovating, but recognising the reinforced blockwork and double brick walls of the original architecture, the couple opted for an entirely cosmetic approach. The apartment was transformed for $70,000, introducing new floors, walls, a kitchen, and bathroom that reflect the spirit of the original design. ‘Performance wise, we double glazed the original timber window frames as part of an effort by the wider building community to retain the original character, performance, and maintenance of the complex,’ says Jack. ‘It is being reviewed for a heritage listing — which we are very supportive of — partly as an outstanding example of well-designed medium density housing in Melbourne.’ Elizabeth and Jack love the location and comfort of their home, which has the rare apartment amenity of windows on all four sides, in addition to a balcony. ‘Having mature gum trees to observe from the living, kitchen, bathroom and balcony is a considerable luxury living in this proximity to the Lygon Street precinct,’ says Jack. Another key benefit of this home for Elizabeth and Jack is the village-like community they’re now part of. ‘There is a strong community in the building, which allows for impromptu dinner parties, guerilla babysitting, and an overall feeling of surveillance and safety.’",
