  "description": "Local transportation remains a challenge for many African regions, which are beset by high fuel costs, low incomes and punishing road conditions. German company AfricroozE aims to solve these challenges with their eponymous e-bike, designed specifically for the African market. The robust bikes were designed to be cheap to produce, using affordable steel and commonly-available components. To weather African road conditions, the bikes are kitted out with thick spokes and fat, puncture-proof tires. With a 350W motor, the single-battery Commuter model has a max payload of 90kg (198.4 lbs), a range of 40 - 60km (25 – 37 miles) and a top speed of 30 km/h (18.6 mph). A more powerful dual-battery Allrounder model boasts a 500W motor, yielding a maximum payload capacity of 150kg (330.7 lbs) and a range of 75 - 100 km (47 – 62 miles). To make it easier (and greener) for riders to power the batteries, AfricroozE has set up a network of solar-powered charging stations across Uganda, Zambia, Kenya, Togo and Benin. They've also trained local mechanics in those regions both to repair the bikes and operate the charging stations, creating local jobs.The bikes start at €600 (USD $682) and the company has created a microcredit system to help buyers finance the bikes. In contrast, a motorcycle can cost more than $10,000, and bring additional costs with both fuel and maintenance.This video tells the development story of the bikes, and shows the impact they're having:",
