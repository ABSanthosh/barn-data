  "text": "I wanted to update you on my Yarbo robot mower experience. My Yarbo recently completed mowing my entire 5,700-square-foot yard with only a couple of minor hiccups. This isn’t a comprehensive review yet – consider it an enthusiastic progress report from someone putting this machine through its paces in a highly challenging environment. Designer: Yarbo My yard presents a formidable challenge for any robotic mower. It features 32 massive oak trees that have stood for decades, predating even my 35-year-old house. These enormous, established oaks create dense canopies and extensive root systems throughout the property. When I first considered getting a robot mower, industry experts warned me that my yard might be too difficult because of these trees. Conventional wisdom has long held that heavily shaded yards remain incompatible with robotic mowing technology. Yarbo’s mapping system has adapted remarkably well to my yard’s unique shape. My property includes a complex layout with narrow corridors, open sections, and tree-dense areas. The yard is bordered by a street, creating a potential challenge for robotic mowing, as I initially worried Yarbo wouldn’t be able to mow right up to the edge without veering off. However, the system’s precision handling proved otherwise. Even when approaching the street boundary, Yarbo maintained stability and followed the mapped path without error. There were moments when I thought it might lose track and roll off, but its navigation remained controlled and accurate, keeping it within the designated mowing area. The planned mowing pattern efficiently manages obstacles, ensuring maximum coverage without unnecessary backtracking. The designated no-go zones, marked in red on the mapping interface, correspond to tree bases and other permanent features that Yarbo avoids during operation. The intelligent pathing system optimizes efficiency by dynamically adjusting navigation based on real-time environmental data collected as it moves. One issue I noticed was that, oddly enough, Yarbo would sometimes fail to detect some of my smaller trees. Despite having designated these areas as no-go zones, the mower occasionally ignored them and attempted to move through, only to get stuck. This resulted in an unsuccessful maneuver and left chunks of torn grass in its wake as the treads dug in. The problem seemed to stem from a mix of factors—perhaps the smaller trees lacked enough contrast for the stereo vision system to recognize them reliably, or the system interpreted them as passable terrain. This behavior was particularly noticeable in areas with smaller trees scattered between larger ones. While Yarbo seamlessly avoided the designated no-go zones for the bigger trees, it struggled with these lower-profile obstacles. The result was repeated attempts to push through, causing unnecessary wear on the grass and the mower. However, I saw some improvement after monitoring the behavior and adjusting the mapped no-go zones. After consulting with the Yarbo team about this issue, they explained that my mowing vision sensitivity was set to “Moderate.” In this mode, the machine distinguishes between green and yellow, treating non-green areas as obstacles. This caused hesitation when it detected obstacles all around. They recommended switching to the “Gentle contact” mode, which relies more on the physical bumper than vision for obstacle detection. This adjustment resolved the issue with the smaller trees. I discovered that selecting the right obstacle avoidance mode is crucial for optimal performance in my yard’s specific conditions. The Yarbo app offers three main options: Moderate bypass: This mode is recommended for complicated lawns with uneven grass. It bypasses obstacles lower than 20cm, such as weeds, stones, and toys. This mode balances missed work areas with safety. Sensitive bypass: Designed for relatively clean and well-maintained lawns with fewer obstacles to offer the safest mowing experience, though it may occasionally miss some work areas. Gentle contact mode is the most effective setting for taller grass over 20cm and areas with divided zones, minimizing missed sections. In my yard, with its mix of shaded areas and transitions between grass and walkways, this adjustment was crucial. Before making the change, Yarbo struggled to differentiate between grass and hardscaped edges, repeatedly misinterpreting transitions as obstacles. It would stop, back up, turn, and try again, only to detect the same “obstacle,” leaving unmowed patches behind. Fortunately, Yarbo support quickly identified the issue and recommended the setting change, which resolved the problem entirely. Traditional robot mowers rely on GPS signals to navigate around properties. This works in open spaces with clear sky views but fails under tree canopies. Trees block or weaken satellite connections that robot mowers need for accurate positioning. Under dense tree cover, typical mowers become disoriented without proper position data. This navigation limitation has frustrated many robot mower owners with wooded properties, often resulting in missed spots, erratic cutting patterns, or mowers that need manual rescue. The Yarbo utilizes a sophisticated, multi-layered navigation system that functions effectively when GPS signals deteriorate under tree canopies. At its core, Visual-Inertial Odometry technology combines camera data with motion sensor information to maintain precise positional awareness without GPS availability. The Yarbo creates an internal mapping system independent of external signals, allowing it to operate in environments where GPS coverage fluctuates or disappears entirely. Yarbo’s stereo vision technology provides depth perception through an advanced binocular camera system. This camera features a 130° viewing angle, a large F2.2 aperture, and ultra-high definition visuals with 6 million pixels. The wide-angle, high-definition visual system allows the mower to assess distances and spatial relationships within its environment accurately. Under my oak trees, where sunlight creates dappled patterns and shifting shadows throughout the day, the Yarbo navigates confidently. It distinguishes between harmless shadows and actual obstacles requiring avoidance. This visual intelligence enables operation in visually complex environments with variable lighting conditions. The Yarbo’s odometry capability tracks movement with remarkable precision. As it travels across my lawn, it continuously calculates the distance covered and directional changes. This running tally of position relative to starting points and yard boundaries ensures the mower always knows its location. Even after extensive operation under dense canopies with completely blocked GPS signals, the Yarbo navigates back to its charging station without confusion. My entire property receives complete coverage without any need for manual intervention in areas missed by the mower. Ultrasonic sensors surrounding the Yarbo provide environmental awareness in all lighting conditions. The mower features its primary binocular stereo camera and two additional side cameras that enhance peripheral awareness. Supporting this camera system are six ultrasonic radars providing 360-degree coverage. These sensors detect obstacles regardless of shadows or bright spots that might confuse purely visual systems. I’ve observed the Yarbo navigate between tree trunks, avoid exposed roots, and maneuver around garden features with an awareness that anticipates potential problems before they occur. This robust detection system ensures consistent performance in sunny spots and deeply shaded areas from morning to evening. As a final failsafe, the Yarbo incorporates a three-stage collision bar that detects physical obstacles if an object somehow evades the primary sensing systems. This multi-layered approach to environmental awareness enables the mower to navigate confidently, even in complex environments with varying light conditions and numerous obstacles. The integration of these technologies creates a cohesive navigation approach. The system automatically adapts to changing conditions throughout my yard. In open areas, RTK GPS provides centimeter-level precision. Under tree canopies, vision and odometry take precedence. This seamless transition between navigation methods occurs without interruption or hesitation. The mower maintains consistent cutting patterns and complete coverage across my entire property, regardless of the obstacles encountered. Substantial onboard computing power powers Yarbo’s sophisticated navigation systems. The system utilizes up to 6 TOPS (Trillion Operations Per Second) of processing power to enable advanced functionalities like the stereo vision and obstacle avoidance systems. This significant computing resource allows the mower to process complex environmental data in real time, facilitating instant decision-making as it navigates under tree canopies. What impressed me most was that Yarbo still had 49% battery after completing its first run. This efficiency opens up more possibilities beyond mowing, allowing me to use Yarbo for additional yard maintenance. With the extra battery life, I can deploy Yarbo to blow leaves off the lawn, clear debris from the street, and manage outdoor upkeep with minimal effort. The extended runtime and versatile functionality make Yarbo a valuable tool for maintaining my yard year-round. The integration of artificial intelligence enhances the effectiveness of Yarbo’s navigation systems. The mower’s AI-powered mapping assistant helps identify lawn edges during the initial mapping process, creating accurate boundary definitions even in areas where GPS precision might be compromised. This intelligent mapping capability ensures the mower maintains awareness of operational boundaries even when navigating solely through vision and odometry under tree canopies. After watching the Yarbo methodically work through my challenging yard, I recognize it as a significant advancement in autonomous lawn care. Its ability to effectively navigate under tree canopies solves a fundamental limitation that has plagued robotic mowing technology. For homeowners with heavily treed properties, the Yarbo’s sophisticated navigation systems, powerful computing, and intelligent technology create a genuinely valuable tool that maintains entire yards without constant supervision. Despite minor operational hiccups, its performance in my complex landscape impressed me considerably. I’ll continue testing and provide more insights as I gain experience, but my initial results suggest that homeowners with extensive tree coverage finally have a practical robotic mowing option for their properties.",
