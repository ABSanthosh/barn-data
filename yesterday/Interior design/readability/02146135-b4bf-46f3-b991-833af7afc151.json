  "text": "Design trends come and go, and while some styles hold up over time, others can make a home feel stuck in the past. You don’t have to chase every new trend, but it’s worth examining your home to see if you have any of these features that are making it look older. Thankfully, many of these are easy to fix, so if your home is feeling a little behind the times, updating a few key features can make all the difference.  Here’s what to look for. 1. Heavy, Dark Wood Cabinets Dark cherry or mahogany kitchen cabinets were a go-to for years, but now they tend to make spaces feel heavy and closed off. Modern kitchens lean toward light and airy finishes that reflect natural light instead. If replacing cabinets isn’t in the budget, a simple coat of paint or even just swapping out the hardware can make a big difference. Even removing a few cabinet doors to create open shelving can make the space feel more current. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / TonyTheTigersSon 2. Tuscan-Style Faux Finishes There was a time when textured walls, sponge painting, and faux finishes were all the rage, but today, they often make a home feel old rather than elegant. The problem lies in these treatments making the walls look busy and outdated. Smoother, neutral-colored walls create a more timeless look. If you’re dealing with heavy textures, a skim coat or fresh paint in a modern shade can instantly refresh a room. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / Shaiith 3. Ornate Wrought Iron Details Elaborate iron scrollwork on stair railings, light fixtures, and even furniture once felt high-end, but now it can make a space feel stuck in the early 2000s. Simpler designs in matte black or mixed metals feel fresher and more adaptable to other ever-changing trends. Updating a stair railing or swapping out a dated chandelier for a cleaner design can instantly modernize a space. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / pro_creator 4. Overly Decorative Tile Backsplashes Highly patterned tile backsplashes with bold colors or intricate designs had their moment, but today, they more often make a kitchen feel cluttered or crowded. Modern-day designs favor simple subway tiles, natural stone, or textured tiles in softer colors. If replacing tile isn’t an option, consider using peel-and-stick alternatives or painting over outdated tile with a more neutral color. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / pro_creator 5. Boxy, Closed-Off Floor Plans Homes built decades ago often have separate rooms for every function, which can feel less inviting compared to today’s more popular open-concept spaces. Knocking down walls isn’t always possible, but there are ways to create better flow. Removing heavy drapes, using light-colored paint, or swapping bulky furniture for more streamlined pieces can make a space feel bigger and brighter. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / pro_creator Updating your home doesn’t mean following every new trend, but small changes can make a big difference. Even a few simple swaps—like changing cabinet hardware, painting walls, or updating light fixtures—can refresh your space without needing a full renovation. The goal isn’t to erase your home’s personality, but to create a space that feels both current, comfortable, and adaptable for the future.
