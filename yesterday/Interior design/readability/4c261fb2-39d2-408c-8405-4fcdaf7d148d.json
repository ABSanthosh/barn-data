  "description": "When briefing Design Scout to renovate their luxury Brisbane apartment, the owners of this home specified ‘nothing anybody else has’ and a deadline just six weeks away. Design Scout achieved the near impossible, touching almost every surface to cosmetically transform the home, within the tight timeframe. White walls and cream cabinetry have been replaced with colour drenched statement surfaces, creating a showstopping home that encourages ‘good vibes only’.",

  "text": "‘Go bold or go home,’ was Design Scout’s philosophy for this Brisbane apartment renovation. The interior designers were given just six weeks to cosmetically transform the modern apartment into a more personalised space, featuring clashing patterns and rich colour. ‘They love unique, original, and quirky design,’ explains Jacinta Platt, director of Design Scout. ‘Also, as this is a holiday home for them, we wanted to evoke a fun, cool style to reflect that when they are there it’s “good vibes only!”’ This is the fourth time Design Scout and this particular client have worked together, providing both parties with full confidence over the final result. ‘They are so wonderful to work with as they keep pushing the envelope… As a designer, to continually reinvent yourself and find new suppliers or products — this is what a creative person dreams of!’ says Jacinta. She adds, ‘Nearly any other person given this brief and timeframe would have declined, yet my incredible staff and list of suppliers took it on as a once in a lifetime challenge! ‘We worked till 12am most nights and 2am leading up to handover. The entire place was buzzing with energy. I feel we all drew on the intense colour theme and fun palette to get us over the line.’ The renovation saw every room of the apartment updated, except for two bathrooms and the existing travertine floors. Otherwise, Jacinta says, ‘no surface was left untouched. Every ceiling was considered, and there is not a white wall in the entire project.’ The designers introduced deep red tones to the main living space, extending to the ceiling, wall panelling, cabinetry, and Rosso Levanto marble on the kitchen island bench. Mixed metals, patterned fabrics, and statement lighting add warmth and depth to the space, while meeting the clients’ request for ‘nothing anybody else has’. The bathroom and bedrooms were equally appointed, making way for textured wall treatments, wallpaper, and mosaic tiles for added drama. Jacinta says, ‘It’s warm and inviting, yet invigorating and stimulating. There’s always something cool to look at whether it be a decor piece or the incredible view.’ The end result is an almost unrecognisable apartment, with a style as unique as its vibrant owners. ‘No more high gloss cream cabinetry and white walls — just colour drenched goodness!’ says Jacinta.",
