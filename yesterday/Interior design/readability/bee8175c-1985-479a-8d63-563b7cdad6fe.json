  "description": "For dedicated surfers, surfboards are wonderful things—when you're riding them. At every other point in time, they're a hassle. You have to have the room in your home to store them. The need to transport them influences your choice of vehicle. If you want to transport one on a plane or a train, be prepared to pay extra fees, and keep your fingers crossed that they don't get destroyed during the baggage handling process.Ewen Mahévas and Hadrien Nauroy are two French surfers who met in engineering school. Frustrated with the hassles of transporting their boards, the two spent several years designing a sturdy surfboard that could be broken down. They also wanted to be able to assemble it in less than a minute, without the use of tools. Their resultant modular design is called the Newave:The boards are made of fiberglass, foam and resin, and feature a unique W-shaped connection point made of reinforced nylon. You join the pieces by locking pins into place by hand. The pair developed their design after strenuous strength testing to ensure the boards' performance. They make seven different components, which you can shape into nine different configurations. Obviously you only buy the components you want, and can later pick up different ones to mix and match. The Newave board comes with a backpack to carry them in. These have been successfully Kickstarted, with 22 days left to pledge at press time. The boards start at $731 for the shortest configuration, going up to $1,117 for the 9' longboard.",
