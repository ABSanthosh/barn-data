  "description": "This week Apple unveiled their new Mac mini, which they've somehow shrunk down to just 5\" square. The company says the tiny size was enabled both by the design of a power-efficient chip, and via \"innovative thermal architecture, which guides air to different levels of the system, while all venting is done through the foot.\"The company also says this is their first carbon neutral Mac:\"Mac mini is made with over 50 percent recycled content overall, including 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure, 100 percent recycled gold plating in all Apple-designed printed circuit boards, and 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. The electricity used to manufacture Mac mini is sourced from 100 percent renewable electricity. And, to address 100 percent of the electricity customers use to power Mac mini, Apple has invested in clean energy projects around the world. Apple has also prioritized lower-carbon modes of shipping, like ocean freight, to further reduce emissions from transportation. Together, these actions have reduced the carbon footprint of Mac mini by over 80 percent. For the small amount of remaining emissions, Apple applies high-quality carbon credits from nature-based projects, like those generated by its innovative Restore Fund.\"\"In another first for Mac mini, the packaging is now entirely fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal to remove plastic from its packaging by 2025.\" The $600 machines will hit store shelves next month.",
