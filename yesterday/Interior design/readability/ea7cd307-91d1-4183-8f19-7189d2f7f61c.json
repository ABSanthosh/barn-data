  "text": "Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker, known for his lush psychedelic soundscapes, has stepped into the world of music tech with *Orchid*, a retro-futuristic chord machine that’s as much a creative tool as it is a design statement. Crafted in collaboration with Ignacio Germade and the team at Telepathic Instruments, this standalone device seems poised to inject some genuine innovation into how musicians, producers, and creators approach chord progressions. The Orchid’s aesthetic grabs your attention with its delightful marriage of mid-century modern design and futuristic minimalism. It doesn’t merely look like a tool for music-making—it feels like an artifact from a parallel timeline where music technology evolved under the influence of Moog synthesizers and Brutalist architecture. There’s something irresistibly tactile about its tiny one-octave keybed, its metallic buttons, and the way its speakers blend seamlessly into its overall silhouette. Think alt-universe Teenage Engineering. Designer: Telepathic Instruments As a chord machine, its primary role is to simplify and expand harmonic possibilities. Press a key, and it triggers a full chord—a concept that might seem basic at first but quickly reveals layers of depth. By holding one of the strategically placed buttons while playing, users can manipulate the chords in real time, shifting them from major to minor, augmenting intervals, or even revoicing them to mimic the dynamics of a guitar or piano. This flexibility turns Orchid into more than a mere convenience—it’s a creative partner that invites experimentation. Unlike most chord machines, which often tether users to computers or DAWs via MIDI, this device functions independently. The onboard speakers and battery power mean you can take it anywhere, from a lazy afternoon jam session in the park to a late-night studio brainstorm. This sense of portability and immediacy reinforces its identity as an “ideas machine.” It’s there to capture inspiration wherever it strikes—no cords, no setup, just you and the music. Yet, Orchid doesn’t neglect connectivity for those who want it. MIDI compatibility ensures it can integrate with larger setups, making it a valuable tool for those who prefer layering its unique chord manipulations with other digital or analog instruments. The internal effects and arpeggiator further extend its creative range, allowing musicians to sculpt evolving soundscapes or rhythmic patterns that might otherwise require multiple pieces of equipment to achieve. What elevates Orchid from a functional gadget to a truly compelling product is the philosophy behind its creation. Telepathic Instruments has described its initial run of 1,000 units as a “beta test.” Early adopters will have a chance to shape future iterations, providing feedback that could refine the design, features, and user experience. Still, at $550, Orchid isn’t exactly cheap. For perspective, chord machines with similar core functionalities can often be found at lower price points, albeit without the standalone capabilities or premium design. But this isn’t a device that’s trying to compete on cost—it’s an aspirational tool, positioned for musicians who value both form and function, and who appreciate tools that inspire creativity rather than merely facilitate it. The Orchid shares quite a few similarities with the Nopia synth from a year ago. Garnering over 20 million views on YouTube in less than a week, the Nopia synth was built to essentially be a “chord generator” too, operating on chords within the tonal harmonic scale. While Nopia did the guess-work, allowing you to be surprised by how the synth picked what chord to play based on what key you were transitioning from, the Orchid is a little more, well, controlled. Your right hand riffs with the keys, while the left chooses the type of chord. In a way it allows you to do anything, even make mistakes – because sometimes creativity comes from unexpected places. Unlike the Nopia, however, the Orchid is available… even if it’s just to 1,000 units.",
