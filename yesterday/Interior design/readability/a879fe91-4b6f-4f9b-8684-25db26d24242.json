  "text": "Dramatically veined marble, colourful storage displays and original architectural features come together in this Brooklyn loft renovated by locally based Batliboi Studio. The space in an early 20th-century former manufacturing building on Atlantic Avenue was converted into a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment for Valerie Tsvetkova, who manages the creative services department for beauty brand Elizabeth Arden. The renovation of this industrial space involved uncovering original ceiling beams and exposing ductworkBatliboi Studio founder Hormuz Batliboi helped his client realise the very specific vision she had for the space, exposing the original structure and introducing touches of drama. \"She wanted an organic yet eclectic feel while maintaining a warm material palette,\" Batliboi told Dezeen. Elements like a green shelving unit and matching pendant lights enliven the dining space\"We approached this by embracing the industrial history of the building and uncovering historic elements like the wood beams and metal structural connections,\" he continued Starting with a blank slate in terms of layout, all the utilities were centralised for optimum functionality. A stainless steel counter, backsplash and floating shelf in the kitchen nod to existing industrial elementsTo achieve this, the floor level for the kitchen and bathrooms was raised to run plumbing, gas and electrical underneath. \"This arrangement allowed us to improve the overall circulation and flow of the layout, and we incorporated remnant stone from the kitchen at the step up — a solution that was not only visually appealing but also added to the loft's overall character,\" said Batliboi. Cabinetry from Reform was customised for the kitchen and hallway storageModular off-the-shelf cabinetry with a wood finish from Reform was customised for the kitchen, and paired with a stainless steel counter, backsplash and floating shelf that plays off the exposed ceiling ductwork. A large island is topped with dramatically veined stone that's repeated in the shower and atop the vanity in the main bathroom. A workspace makes the most of natural light from the loft's large windowsThis bathroom also features penny tiling, olive green walls and brass fixtures, while the second is lined with inky black zellige tiles on the walls and matte black tiles across the floor. \"These elements add a certain richness and mystique to the space, further accentuated by the natural light streaming from the massive window in the bathroom,\" Batliboi said. The loft's wooden ceiling beams – originally hidden by a dropped ceiling — and large windows are best appreciated in the open-plan living and dining area. Here, a large dining table sits in front of a bespoke storage element that's topped with a swooping green strip. The primary bathroom features dramatically veined marble, penny tiles and brass fixtures\"This unique piece, fashioned as an organic green ribbon, anchors one wall and also functions as a sideboard,\" Batliboi said. \"The colour was carefully matched to the dining room pendants that the client already had her heart set on, ensuring a harmonious balance in the room.\" A second bathroom is lined with inky black zellige tilesBrooklyn's industrial past has left a plethora of similar warehouse buildings to be converted for residential use. Other examples with recently completed interiors include an apartment renovation inside a former chocolate factory and a loft that was \"gently redesigned\" using subtle tones and textures.
