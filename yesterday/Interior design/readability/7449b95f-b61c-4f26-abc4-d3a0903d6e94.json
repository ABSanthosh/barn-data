  "text": "There are some kinds of furniture that I don’t really pay much attention to their design. Since I have a limited space (and a lot of stuff), my preference for them is more functional than aesthetic. Side tables are one kind of home furniture that are like that for me, although there are several designs there that do catch my attention, even if I probably won’t actually buy them. Designer: Ross Sorokovyi (MUDU Design) The Totem concept for a side table is one of those eye-catching designs as it’s pretty cute. Named after its inspiration, it is a minimalist kind of furniture and when I say minimalist, I also mean small. That’s why I say that I probably won’t use it since it may not be so useful for a maximalist like me. But if you’re looking for a cute kind of side table, then this may appeal to you. The base and “pole” of the side table is made from solid wood while the table top uses a stainless steel material. It has a three-legged base which makes it look like a cartoon character. The table top seems to be detachable based on the product renders. It also can be connected to other Totems, if like me, you find it too small. There also seems to be different heights for the side table so you can create a more aesthetic look if you have space. The thin metal edges can also be a bit intimidating, as if it could cut into your skin if you press too hard. Circles are also not the most space-efficient shape, as you are cutting corners, almost literally. You lose out on some space in exchange for a unique and pleasing visual. Then again, as a minimalist side table, that might be fine for some people. For now, Totem remains a concept as the designers are still looking for a manufacturer, although they’re looking at 2025 as the year they will actually produce it. When it comes an actual side table, we might get more details about it, in case it interests you.",
