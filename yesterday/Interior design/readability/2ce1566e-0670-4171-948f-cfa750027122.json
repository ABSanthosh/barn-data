  "text": "Much like her heart-wrenching lyrics, Missy Higgins’ home has evocative superpowers. ‘I loved all the wood, brick, and natural materials,’ the singer-songwriter says of the first time she saw the home. ‘It just made me feel really grounded as soon as I walked inside.’ The house, built in 1976, is one of many that prolific designer Alistair Knox completed in Melbourne’s outer north-eastern suburbs — an area known for its magic combination of mid-century residences and lush surrounding bushland. ‘I’ve always loved ’70s architecture. I’m a big fan of Alistair Knox and how he used mostly reclaimed materials. He also has this beautiful way of making you feel like you’re surrounded by trees, even when you’re inside,’ Missy says. ‘And of course, the wildlife is abundant out here. There are kangaroos in the garden every morning and a cacophony of birdsong to wake up to. It can make recording music difficult, but it’s worth it!’ Missy and her two kids, Sammy (9) and Luna (5), are just the third owners of the nostalgia-tinged home, which they’ve renovated with the help of architect Ben Bindon. When they first moved in, the house was showing its age, so a large portion of the works were focused on essential updates, like overhauling the bathrooms to fix leaky and rusted pipes; replacing the broken heating and floors; and installing double-glazed windows. Knocking down a big timber wall that divided the kitchen and living room was one of the more ‘major’ decisions, but it’s made the house feel so much more open, allowing Missy to ‘see if the kids are getting up to mischief’ while she’s busy in the kitchen. ‘I was adamant I wanted to retain the character and integrity of the original Alistair Knox design,’ Missy says. ‘Luckily, Ben was a Knox fan too, so he wanted to update it in a way he felt Knox himself would approve of.’ The renovations also got a tick of approval from the original owner, Greg Provan, who came for a visit with his family after the project was completed, and shared stories of his time in the home, praising the new iterations. This sentimentality is exactly why Missy was drawn to the home in the first place, recalling fond family memories had in her parents ’50s beach house on the Mornington Peninsula. ‘I think this place felt like a holiday house to me… There are a lot of similar elements to it that felt very nostalgic,’ she says. It’s a home that looks and feels lived-in, in the best way possible. Sammy and Luna’s artworks hang proudly in the stairwell alongside the old Steinway Upright piano — Missy’s most cherished possession, passed down from her great-grandmother. ‘I don’t mind a bit of clutter and personality in my house. It represents my family life which is beautifully messy sometimes, but always creative.’ She even recorded her deeply personal sixth album from her home studio. The Second Act was released in September, exactly 20 years since her debut pulled at the heartstrings of the nation. Having just wrapped up a string of sold-out shows, Missy is loving the comfort of her safe space. ‘It’s a cliché, but my home is absolutely my sanctuary,’ she says. ‘When I come back from tour I barely leave the house; it’s just such a calming and beautiful place to live. I feel so lucky.’ This story originally appeared in Issue 01 of The Design Files Magazine, on sale now.",
