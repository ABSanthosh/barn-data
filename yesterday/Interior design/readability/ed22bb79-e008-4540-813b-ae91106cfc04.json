  "text": "Saudi Arabia decided to upgrade and improve their transportation network. And they’ve designed a massive new driverless metro system which will be the longest in the world. The Riyadh Metro will begin on December 1 and will include the opening of three lines. Another line will open in January, and two more after that. It will occupy a total length of 109 miles, and it will connect main districts, business centers, and cultural landmarks throughout the capital city. Designer: Zaha Hadid Architects The metro will be able to hold 3.6 million daily passengers once fully completed. It will reduce road traffic quite a bit throughout the city and also reduce CO2 emissions by 12.5 million tons annually. The network will include 85 metro systems, the most renowned one is Zaha Hadid Architects’ King Abdullah Financial District (KAFD) Metro Station. The station is blessed with a thoughtfully designed and carefully calculated layout that will be easy for passengers to navigate. The exterior is equipped with an attractive latticed curving form that will take the brunt of the harsh summer heat. 69 Alstom Metropolis trains and 47 Innovia Metro trains will be employed. All the trains are electric. They will be classified into three classes – first class, family class, and singles class. They will also include ergonomic seating. The trains will also be equipped with LED lighting, air-conditioning, and a passenger information system. They are automated and have been used in Budapest, Sydney, and Taipei in the driverless transit systems. “The trains are driverless,” said Alstom. “The train movements are protected by a state-of-the-art signaling system controlling the speed of the trains, ensuring smooth and safe operations including automatic opening of the train doors. The fully air-conditioned stations are equipped with platform screen doors also preventing people to access the track. The trains are also equipped with an advanced passenger information system delivering real-time information to the passengers through screens and loudspeakers on board the train and on the station platforms.”",
