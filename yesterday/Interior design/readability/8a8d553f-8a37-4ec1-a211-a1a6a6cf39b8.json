  "description": "Anything this Melbourne one-bedroom apartment lacks in size, it makes up for in personality. The 1960s apartment is home to Stu Smith (founder of sun-protective clothing brand Sun Ray) who challenged himself to design and renovate the Fitzroy North home in just six weeks, with a budget of about $47,000. While he had to move in without a completed kitchen, Stu has brilliantly enhanced the home’s mid-century feel with customised IKEA joinery, cork flooring, and splashes of colour in every room. In our latest Renovation Diary, he reveals a full budget breakdown below!",

The fashion buyer and founder of UPF50+ clothing brand Sun Ray immediately had a vision for the renovation the moment he stepped inside the one-bedroom apartment in Fitzroy last year. ‘The potential to create a bright, open space with views to the treetops of Edinburgh Gardens inspired me to modernise the interior,’ Stu says. ‘I loved the apartment’s sunny northerly aspect, with big windows overlooking my favourite pocket of Melbourne. I particularly loved the 1960s bathroom and tiles, so I wanted to keep as much of the mid-century features as I could.’ How he maximised space ‘Before the renovation, the apartment had a traditional 1960s layout with separate rooms for the kitchen, living room, bedroom, and bathroom,’ Stu says. He decided to rework the compartmentalised floorplan to increase the home’s sense of space, engaging Caedman Construction to remove a wall dividing the kitchen and living room — allowing natural light to flood into the new open-plan area. ‘We added a support beam, which became a design feature painted in a bold green. A nod to both mid-century style and a modern twist,’ Stu adds. The best budget-friendly kitchen hack Like most renovations, designing a new kitchen consumed most of Stu’s budget. But one savvy hack helped keep the kitchen’s cost to $22,700. Rather than splurging on a full bespoke fit-out, Stu replaced the kitchen with cupboard carcasses from IKEA and enlisted NRG Projects to create customised fronts for the cabinets. The new sage green-stained birch plywood joinery brings a playful yet polished energy to the interiors, alongside sleek floating steel shelves. However, the old hot water system had to be moved to create space for a dishwasher, adding on an extra $3000. ‘It was expensive and unforeseen… but I knew I wanted a dishwasher,’ Stu explains. Enhancing the home’s retro character ‘I wanted to blend playful, bold colours with natural materials to achieve a warm, inviting feel,’ Stu says. The refreshed interiors toe the line between fun and functional, serving as a perfect backdrop for an ‘evolving’ collection of classic furniture and eclectic pieces. New cork tile flooring from CorkArt was installed for a mid-century-inspired look and cosy texture. Meanwhile, each room also got a unique colour treatment; cream walls and green accents for the living room; dusty pink and red in the bedroom; and mint green with cobalt blue in the bathroom. The challenges of a tight timeline ‘I had a pretty tight schedule as I was aiming to complete most of the renovation in the six weeks I gave myself between settlement, and the end of my previous rental lease,’ Stu says. ‘Unsurprisingly, everything took longer than expected, but I was still able to move in on the planned date, albeit without a kitchen. I lived in a construction site where the bathroom doubled as my kitchen for around a month!’ Final word Stu’s decision to keep the ‘bones’ of the apartment and add his own flair with mostly cosmetic changes allowed him to balance ‘splurges with savings’. The total renovation, including necessary trades, cost him about $47,100. He changed some of the materials along the way, but overall his vision has come to life without straying far from his initial budget ‘Custom cabinetry added a bit more than planned, but it was worth it to create something unique.’ And in small homes, you can never have enough storage!
