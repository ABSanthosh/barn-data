  "text": "When it’s that time of the month or when I’m just so stressed (which can also be both at the same time), one of my constant wishes is to get a massage. But of course, it’s not the best time to have one especially if you’re experiencing dysmenorrhea. A comfortable, relaxing massage would be pretty helpful during those times, even if it’s not an actual, proper massage. Designer: Bebop Design The AM1 massager is an abdominal massager that is meant to be more comfortable rather than just functional. In fact, it was designed to be somehow part of the furniture, like you would leave a cushion lying around on your couch or on your bed. And when you’re using it, it is meant to be like you’re hugging a cushion to your tummy and you’re being massaged at the same time. It can also look like a VR headset except that it will be wrapped around your abdomen rather than your head. It follows the body line with smooth silhouette. It has a fabric in the front which brings the comfortable feeling even as the vibration of the massage feature of the device is shaking you up. There isn”t other information about this massager, like what features it may have and also other specifications. But as it is, and because of my aforementioned issues during certain times of the month, it’s something I might want to own someday especially if it is as comfortable and destressing as it promises.",
