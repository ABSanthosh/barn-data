  "text": "If you love both the contemporary and traditional styles—you don’t have to choose one! The Grata Villa—a project by Loak Designs and Habiba Yasser—shows us how the modern design style beautifully marries with vintage elements. So, you get the best of both worlds. In this project, herringbone floors whisper old-world sophistication while neutral tones soothe the soul. Indeed, every corner of Grata Villa invites you to linger a little longer. And this tour of the space will show you why. The living room in this design project layers neutrals—but with plenty of textures. The fringed ottomans add a vintage charm to the space while the wooden built-in shelves not only add functionality but also contribute to the overall warm feeling of the space. We especially love the subtle patterns added through the soft furnishings. The dining area and kitchen both exemplify a modern style with a vintage twist. The curved wooden frames of the dining chairs make for a timeless addition. The kitchen sticks to a simple vibe with modern wooden cabinetry and beige backsplash. Moving towards the staircase, we see a small table and decorative seating. Upstairs is another living area with low-profile seating and boasting outdoor views. The bedrooms in this villa are a world apart. Each room sticks to a neutral (read: wooden) palette, but makes sure to maintain visual interest. This is done either with statement patterns or textures on the wall. There are also cozy seating areas next to the windows, plus sleek workstations. In the first bathroom, we see a classic vintage vibe with some hints of the modern style. Classic patterns and green panels dominate the space, while the vessel sink adds to the rustic vibe. The mirror is strategically placed to reflect a gallery wall. In the second bathroom, we see more of a modern touch with marble accents and a slat-like feature wall. The wall-mounted toilet is sleek and space-savvy. Last but definitely not the least is the outdoor space. This features cozy seating with a wooden frame, cushions, and a throw blanket. There’s also a small console nearby to hold your coffee.",
