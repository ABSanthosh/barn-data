  "text": "When you look at products in the market that are meant for parent-child bonding, it can be a little skewed towards mothers. But of course most fathers also want to spend quality time with their kids, especially with activities like camping or being in the outdoors. This product concept comes out of that idea for some “emotional” bonding between dads and their kids, but can also be used by any parent, regardless of gender. Designer: Kim Taeyeon Key_Story (or Key-Story, which are both indicated in the concept page) is a concept for a beam projector that you can take along to your camping trip or to any outdoor activity. It is meant to foster an emotional, bonding moment between father and children by watching videos projected on a surface. We assume that you need a wall or a cloth to project of course. The device is designed to look like a robot and has bright colors in order to attract the attention of the kids, especially the younger ones. The top part, which looks like the robot head, is the beam projector and the bottom part is the speaker for “vivid sound”. The package will supposedly come with three Keys that have different content available. You touch the key to the top of the projector to view the videos. There’s also USB and Bluetooth connectivity in case you have your own video content and you can charge the projector on a C-type port. The two parts have “free movement” because of magnets which should make kids more interested to operate it, but hopefully not break it.",
