  "text": "I remember back in the day when cell phones were still being dreamt about by manufacturers, whenever there was a power outage, the first thing you reach for was a flashlight. But when mobile devices with flashlight features finally came into being, we would immediately turn to them whenever we needed some temporary form of illumination. Now, just like with most things considered “vintage”, we’re getting old products with a more modern take to make them still relevant (although functionally, they’ve always been relevant). The Barebones Vintage Flashlight delivers something refreshingly different — a thoughtful blend of nostalgic design and modern functionality. Inspired by vintage utility flashlights, this everyday LED light is not just about looks; it’s built to perform. At first glance, the flashlight’s cage styling and hammertone textured paint catch the eye, evoking a classic, industrial vibe. But under that old-school exterior lies smart, updated engineering. Its dual-brightness 3W LED bulb offers two levels of light: a soft 18-lumen glow for low needs and a powerful 170 lumens when you need full brightness. Thanks to its telescoping focus adjustment, you can narrow or widen the beam depending on the task, whether reading in a tent or lighting up a trail. Designer: Barebones Built from aluminum and steel, the flashlight is sturdy yet lightweight. Its IPX4 water resistance means it can handle splashes and light rain, a critical feature for outdoor use. The additional hook on the bottom lets you hang it at eye level, whether in the garage, under the hood of a car, or from a tree branch at your campsite. Powered by a Barebones-specific Li-ion 18650 battery (2200mAh, 3.7V), the flashlight delivers up to 15 hours of runtime on low or 1.5 hours on high, plenty for most needs. Recharging is easy with a USB-C cable, and a full recharge takes just 3–4 hours, making it ready for your next adventure or emergency. Compact and perfectly sized to fit comfortably in your hand, it’s the kind of tool you’ll want to toss in your bag, car, or camping kit – not just because it looks good, but because it delivers when you need it most. Whether you’re hiking, working in the garage, or preparing for unexpected blackouts, the Barebones Vintage Flashlight offers a reliable, stylish solution that bridges the past and present. It’s a piece of equipment that connects generations, honoring the rugged, dependable tools of the past while seamlessly integrating it with modern technology. Now we’ll wait for videos of Gen Z and Gen Alpha kids figuring out how to actually use flashlights.",
