Blue and White Mug Favorite Amazon Home Decor Finds Hello friends! I have some really cute new home decor pieces from Amazon I thought I would share with you (along with a few other items we’ve been loving!). Blue and White Rug I’ve kept this rug rolled up in the closet just waiting until i got a rug pad for it. When I finally took it out last week I discovered it had a non-slip backing on it already! That’s SO much better for a runner than having to use a rug pad! This rug is one of my all time favorites for high traffic areas: it’s kid and pet friendly, washable and anti-slip! Finnegan loves it, and so do I :). Blue Hydrangeas and Green Hydrangeas After my faux tulip comparison this spring and the discovery of more realistic faux florals, I decided to try new hydrangeas! I’m try to grow my own but after a few run ins with deer, it’s slow going. Meanwhile, I LOVE these! (Blue Hydrangeas and Green Hydrangeas). They feel SO much more realistic than the silk ones I’ve had in the past, plus the colors are gorgeous! They have nice long stems too so I’m excited to use them in vases and door baskets. These three items aren’t as recent but I have them out all the time and am asked about them often: Salt and Pepper Mills (received these as a birthday gift from my family and love them–I had admired them for years!) Whale Wood Board Tea Kettle Lightweight Blankets I’m a big fan of lightweight blankets, we use them all the time! I spotted this cute checkered one a week ago and LOVE IT! I bought two, they are so cozy and nice to keep furniture clean from pets. They come in lots of other colors and solid options, too. Outdoor Hydrangea Pillow This outdoor pillow insert (square) and this outdoor lumbar pillow insert for this lumbar pillow cover Blue Outdoor Rocking Chairs (color options). We also have these chair covers and they worked great all winter. Silicone Flower Mug Lids I found the best mug accessory! I love these little silicone flower lids. They keep my coffee hot and keeps any bugs out while I’m working or sitting outside! Aren’t they so cute? Outdoor Table Lamp I shared more about these here. It’s currently available and on sale HERE (you get the green and white shade as well as the rattan shade!) These lamps go out of stock fast so order quick if you want one! Towel Rod // Buffalo Check Curtains // Bird Art and Frames Gold Swivel Towel Rack I got this for our bathroom …. This towel rod looks to be exactly the same (the one I got is here which is out of stock currently). Ceramic Berry Basket I love this color! It is called a berry basket, which it would be adorable to serve a few berries on, but I thought it would also make a cute soap holder. I’m just using it for my diffuser remote for now, so cute! A couple more recent Amazon Favorites not pictured: This dress on Amazon has been so nice for warmer days, it comes in lots of colors and patterns. I love clothes that are easy to just throw on without thinking so much :). This retractable car charger isn’t decor related, but my husband is so happy with it he said I should share it with you! I got him this because he didn’t like how slow our other car charger was. This one can charge both of our phones so fast! It has great reviews — we can confirm, it’s a good one!
