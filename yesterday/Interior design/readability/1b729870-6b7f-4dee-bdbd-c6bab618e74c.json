With a staggering price tag of $50 million, as reported by Mansion Global, the mansion’s listing turned heads, though the price was later reduced by $10 million. Originally developed by Robert B. Lynd before the dawn of the 20th century, this mansion stands in what has become one of the world’s most iconic neighborhoods. The Vanderbilt family, known as one of America’s wealthiest clans, made this lavish residence their home in 1924. It’s here that Gloria Vanderbilt spent much of her childhood. A Historic Address on Manhattan’s Most Famous Street Photo Credit: Douglas Elliman Real Estate The mansion features a striking façade with four rows of three large, rectangular windows, creating an impressive street view. This photograph captures only a glimpse of the seven-story structure, showcasing just a fraction of its twelve grand windows, which add to the home’s allure. Located on East 72nd Street, the property sits just a block from Central Park, nestled amidst the vibrant artistic and fashion scene of the city. With 18,000 square feet of historic space, the grandeur of this mansion might overshadow nearby landmarks. A Serene Sanctuary of White Décor Photo Credit: Douglas Elliman Real Estate One of the main living rooms exemplifies the mansion’s elegance, featuring a spacious layout adorned with white decor. Floor-to-ceiling windows offer ample natural light, while the ceiling’s circular indentation creates an airy ambiance. The room’s centerpiece, a gas-burning fireplace, complements the rich hardwood flooring, which boasts a unique design that elevates the home’s aesthetic. An Entertainer’s Paradise Photo Credit: Douglas Elliman Real Estate Adjacent to the living area, a well-appointed wet bar enhances the entertaining potential of this home. Outfitted with crown molding, elegant wooden cabinetry, and marble countertops, this space is perfect for hosting lavish gatherings without the hassle of trekking down multiple levels for refreshments. Convenience Meets Luxury with an Elevator Photo Credit: Douglas Elliman Real Estate With seven levels to traverse, the mansion includes a convenient elevator—an essential feature for easy access to all areas, especially for those with mobility concerns. When the Vanderbilts moved in, Gloria was just an infant, and her mother would have certainly appreciated the luxury of avoiding stairs with a stroller. Elegant Hallways and Grand Staircases Photo Credit: Douglas Elliman Real Estate The mansion’s hallways are as expansive as some bedrooms, lined with brass-railed staircases and adorned with impressive canvas art. These wide spaces provide a perfect backdrop for displaying valuable artwork and heirlooms. The Vanderbilt legacy began with Cornelius Vanderbilt, who amassed his fortune through strategic investments in the railroad industry during the Industrial Revolution. A Spacious Family Room Photo Credit: Douglas Elliman Real Estate The family room features a massive L-shaped couch that mirrors the room’s unique window design. Wrapped in windows, this inviting space floods with natural light, complemented by crown molding and hardwood floors, creating a cozy yet sophisticated atmosphere. A Stunning Kitchen Island Photo Credit: Douglas Elliman Real Estate The kitchen boasts a remarkable limestone floor and modern finishes, remodeled just recently. Equipped with top-of-the-line appliances from Gaggenau, Viking Tuscany, and Miele, the kitchen is both functional and aesthetically stunning. A Calacatta marble countertop offers ample prep space, while custom cabinetry ensures everything has its place. An Inviting Dining Space Photo Credit: Douglas Elliman Real Estate Beyond the kitchen, a versatile area can serve as a breakfast nook or a formal dining space, further emphasizing the home’s design flexibility. A double oven complements the gas stove, while barstools line the expansive marble island, making it ideal for casual meals or entertaining. A Luxurious Powder Room Photo Credit: Douglas Elliman Real Estate This stylish powder room features a sleek copper sink and a modern tankless toilet. With eleven bathrooms throughout the mansion, this convenient space offers a chic alternative for guests. A Full-Service Bathroom Photo Credit: Douglas Elliman Real Estate One of the mansion’s bathrooms exemplifies luxury, complete with marble finishes, a tub, and a built-in shower. This lavish space is perfect for relaxation in total luxury and class. Exquisite Design Details Photo Credit: Douglas Elliman Real Estate The master bathroom showcases stunning contrasts with deep wood accents, stark white sinks, and a freestanding bathtub, offering a serene escape. Each bathroom in the mansion reflects a high standard of elegance and functionality. A Family-Friendly Space Photo Credit: Douglas Elliman Real Estate Designed with family in mind, one room features a stylish bunk bed, ensuring ample space for guests. With twelve rooms in total, the mansion comfortably accommodates the family and all of their guests. Versatile Bedrooms Photo Credit: Douglas Elliman Real Estate The versatile design of another bedroom, equipped with twin beds and a desk, allows for various uses, whether as a guest room, home office, or yoga space. The natural light pouring in enhances the inviting atmosphere. Charming Aesthetic Touches Photo Credit: Douglas Elliman Real Estate Another bedroom boasts large windows with beautiful views, perfect for relaxation. However, the modern art on the wall seems understated compared to Gloria’s vibrant and colorful creations as an artist and fashion designer. Adaptable Living Spaces Photo Credit: Douglas Elliman Real Estate This expansive room, categorized as a bedroom, can easily transform into a living area or bonus room.
