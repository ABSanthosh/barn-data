Happy November 17th! – wheew!!! Above is a sneak peek from my daughter Mandy’s wedding. For the last few weeks I have been in wedding prep mode which was keeping me busy. That, plus all the house repairs going on left me no time for anything else. The wedding was last weekend. The weather was beautiful as was everything. All went smoothly. It was a fun wedding with lots of dancing. I have been editing photos and will share a post all about it this week. Once we got home, I crashed and decided to take it slow all week, hence no new post, all I had the energy for was to update an older holiday post: Christmas Tree Stand Collar Made Using Dollar Store Frames (open in same tab) Yesterday I got my energy back and started to take apart my studioffice to ready it for some changes as well as pull out a few Christmas bins to come up with a plan to decorate my house for the holidays.
