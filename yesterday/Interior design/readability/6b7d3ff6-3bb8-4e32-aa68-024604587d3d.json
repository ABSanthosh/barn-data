It’s frustrating, but it doesn’t have to be. With the right approach, you can make the process quick, easy, and even a little satisfying. These tips will help you get everything looking and feeling just right without the struggle. Start with the Right Fit Not all sheets fit the way they should. Over time, some shrink in the wash, while others might not be the correct size to begin with. Always check the dimensions of your mattress and compare them to your sheets. If your fitted sheet constantly pops off, try deep-pocket versions or sheet fasteners. If your flat sheet feels too short, you might be putting it on the wrong way, as many sheets are longer than they are wide. Taking a few seconds to check before you start can save you from having to redo everything later.

The easiest way to put one on is to start with a corner at the top of the bed, then stretch the opposite bottom corner next. This diagonal approach makes it easier to pull the rest into place. If you struggle with tight corners, slip your hand under the mattress to lift it slightly instead of forcing the sheet over it. And if you’re not sure which side goes where, look for the tag. Most fitted sheet tags go in the bottom right corner of the mattress.

Lay the sheet upside down, with the finished side facing the mattress so when you fold it over at the top, the nice side will show. This works especially well if your sheets have a design or trim. Also, make sure the sheet is even on both sides before tucking it in. If you struggle with it staying in place, tuck it in at the bottom first before moving to the sides.

Lay the duvet flat on the bed, then turn the cover inside out and place it on top. Starting at the closed end, roll everything together like a burrito. Once it’s rolled up, flip the cover right-side out over the roll, then unroll it. The duvet will settle perfectly inside without all the shaking and adjusting. This method works especially well for larger duvet covers that tend to get tangled. Photo Credit: Canva Pro Stop Sheets from Slipping Off Nothing is more annoying than waking up to find the sheets have slipped off the bed. To prevent this, tuck the bottom sheet tightly under the mattress. If you have a smooth mattress that makes the sheet slide around, use a mattress pad or sheet fasteners. For flat sheets, hospital corners keep everything in place. Just tuck the excess fabric under itself at the corners, like wrapping a present. If your duvet tends to slide, look for covers with ties inside to secure it. Photo Credit: Canva Pro Make Bed-Making a Habit Ultimately, the best way to make putting on bedsheets easier is to do it regularly. If you struggle with motivation, setting a routine, like washing and changing sheets on the same day each week, makes it feel less like a chore. Over time, it becomes second nature, and nothing beats the feeling of climbing into a perfectly made bed at the end of the day. Photo Credit: Canva Pro Putting on bedsheets doesn’t have to be such an annoying experience. From mastering the fitted sheet to using smart folding techniques, all you need is a few simple tricks to make it a much easier, and less dreaded, chore. A clean, well-made bed feels good, looks inviting, and helps make for a restful night. Keep these tips in mind, and you’ll never have to wrestle with your sheets again.
