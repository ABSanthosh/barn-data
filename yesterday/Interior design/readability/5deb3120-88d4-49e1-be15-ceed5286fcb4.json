Every few years, we reach a time when a certain category of devices/services becomes a tech essential. Mobile phones became essentials in the 2000s, a social media presence became essential in the 2010s, we ditched CDs for hard disks, hard disks for SSDs, and somewhere in the middle, we even dabbled with cloud storage. It’s 2025, and I’ve come up with my list of 7 gadgets you should absolutely own by now. I wouldn’t call myself a prepper or doomer by any stretch of the imagination, but I trust myself more than the crumbling institutions and power-hungry corporations around me. These 6 products are common-sense purchases, to be honest, but they’re all rooted in a sense of independence and preparedness. In relying on yourself rather than everything around you. The original list had 5 products, but I added a 6th one in – even though the last item is a no-brainer, more than 90% of the world still doesn’t own one, so it definitely seemed like the right thing to do to add it to this list. Here are my 6 absolute essential tech gadgets to have in 2025 and beyond. 1. Network Attached Storage (NAS) You’re probably reading this on a phone, and if I’m not wrong, your phone is probably filled with photos and videos that periodically get backed up to the cloud – a cloud that you pay for. There was a time when phones just came with their own memory cards, and you could pop one in, fill it up, and then replace it. Of course, cloud drives became a lot more convenient, allowing you to back photos up from 10 years ago and access them whenever – but two things happened. One, these subscriptions became an add-on expense that you ended up paying hundreds a year for, but also, two, you relinquished control over your personal memories, relying instead on Google, Apple, or Microsoft. The “Fappening” iCloud breach of 2014 starkly illustrated the vulnerability of cloud-stored media to hacks, while recent controversies surrounding AI training have raised concerns about how our data might be used without our full understanding or consent. Enter the Network Attached Storage (NAS) solution – your personal cloud that puts you back in control of your data. A NAS device is essentially a mini-server for your home network, allowing you to store, access, and share your files securely from any device. Setting up a NAS is simpler than ever, typically involving connecting the device to your router, installing hard drives, and following a user-friendly setup wizard. Once configured, you can access your files remotely, stream media to your devices, and even run your own cloud services. When shopping for a NAS, consider factors like the number of drive bays (which determines total storage capacity), processor power (important for running multiple services or transcoding media), and RAM (crucial for smooth performance with multiple users). Look for features like easy drive replacement, robust backup options, and app ecosystems that extend the NAS’s functionality. Some NAS devices even offer built-in protection against ransomware and other cyber threats, providing peace of mind for your digital life. When selecting a NAS for your home, three excellent options cover the spectrum of needs and budgets. For beginners or those prioritizing simplicity, Synology’s DiskStation DS220+ ($300 plus drives) offers an intuitive interface and straightforward setup process, perfect for basic file storage, photo management, and light media streaming. Users with more demanding requirements should consider QNAP’s TS-253D ($400 plus drives), which excels at multimedia tasks like 4K video transcoding and hosting multiple simultaneous streams to different devices. Budget-conscious shoppers will appreciate TerraMaster’s F2-210 ($180 plus drives), which handles essential backup and file-sharing functions admirably despite its lower price point. All three systems can be set up in under an hour using their guided installation wizards, require minimal maintenance once configured, and ultimately pay for themselves by eliminating monthly cloud storage fees while keeping your data firmly under your control. 2. Power Station Energy independence has shifted from a luxury to a necessity in 2025, as aging power grids struggle against increasingly extreme challenges. Recent events like the devastating Los Angeles fires, the Midwest polar vortex that left millions without heat, and the Pacific Northwest earthquake that crippled power infrastructure for weeks have highlighted the vulnerability of our electrical systems. Power stations – essentially portable, rechargeable batteries with built-in inverters – have emerged as the modern solution to an increasingly unreliable electrical infrastructure. These versatile energy hubs provide peace of mind during emergencies while offering practical utility for everything from weekend camping trips to powering essential home appliances during extended blackouts. Power stations come in various capacities to suit different needs. Compact models weighing under 10 pounds deliver 200-300 watt-hours – perfect for charging devices, running small appliances, or powering lighting during short camping trips. Mid-range units offering 500-1000 watt-hours can handle more demanding applications like CPAP machines, mini-refrigerators, and power tools. The high-capacity segment, featuring 1500+ watt-hour capacities and dual-phase outputs, can power entire home circuits, including refrigerators, medical equipment, and heating systems during extended outages. Many premium models now feature modular battery systems, allowing you to expand capacity as needed without replacing the entire unit. The technology powering these stations has advanced dramatically, with lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries offering longer lifespans, improved safety, and better performance in extreme temperatures compared to older lithium-ion chemistries. Solar charging capabilities have become standard, with efficient MPPT controllers maximizing energy harvest from portable panels. This solar integration creates truly sustainable power systems, allowing users to generate electricity indefinitely in remote locations or during prolonged grid failures. Advanced features like app connectivity, programmable power management, and UPS (uninterruptible power supply) functionality provide unprecedented control over your energy usage. Anker’s PowerHouse series leads the market with exceptional build quality and intuitive interfaces that make complex power management accessible to everyone. BLUETTI has established itself as the innovation leader, pioneering features like dual voltage outputs and expandable battery systems in their AC200 and EP500 models. Jackery, once considered an underdog, has rapidly gained market share with their Explorer series, offering excellent value and reliability for outdoor enthusiasts. VTOMAN has made waves with their rugged, military-inspired designs and impressive power-to-weight ratios. Investment in these systems ranges from $500-800 for entry-level models suitable for device charging and small appliances, to $1,500-3,000 for mid-range units that can power essential home circuits or even your EV, all the way up to $3,000-7,000 for comprehensive home backup systems with expandable capacity. 3. Vehicle Dash Cam Most smart homes are equipped with video doorbells or at the least, buildings have CCTVs installed in them so that there’s evidence of everyone who’s entered or left. If your homes can have advanced surveillance systems, why can’t your car? Whether it’s recording something as absurd as a meteor crash (remember that dashcam footage from Russia 10 years ago?) or recording footage to avoid liability in the case of an accident, a dash cam is an absolute tech essential that I can’t recommend enough to people. With insurance fraud schemes becoming increasingly sophisticated and hit-and-run incidents on the rise, having video evidence of your driving can save you thousands in disputed claims. A quality dash cam serves as your silent, impartial witness on the road, documenting everything from fender benders to attempted insurance scams. In an age where video evidence often makes the difference between being found at fault or exonerated, this small device delivers peace of mind that far outweighs its cost. Modern dashcams have transcended their simple recording origins to become smart devices packed with features that enhance both safety and convenience. Look for models with high-resolution recording (at least 1440p) for capturing license plate details, wide dynamic range (WDR) for balanced exposure in challenging lighting conditions, and GPS for tracking location and speed data. Advanced features worth considering include parking mode (which activates when it detects motion while your car is parked), lane departure warnings, and collision detection. Some premium models even offer cloud connectivity, automatically uploading footage when incidents occur, ensuring your evidence is preserved even if your camera is damaged or stolen. Installation has become remarkably straightforward, with most models either attaching to your windshield via suction cups or adhesive mounts, or discreetly integrating with your rearview mirror. Power typically comes from your vehicle’s 12V outlet or can be hardwired to your car’s electrical system for a cleaner look and to enable parking mode. When selecting a dash cam, consider whether you want front-only recording or a dual-camera system that captures both front and rear views. For those living in extreme climates, look for models with good operating temperature ranges and capacitor-based power systems rather than batteries, which can fail in high heat. Brands like Nextbase have established themselves as leaders in the consumer dash cam market, with their Series 2 models offering excellent value and user-friendly interfaces. Blackvue’s DR900X series represents the premium end of the spectrum, with 4K recording and robust cloud connectivity features. Garmin’s Dash Cam series brings the company’s navigation expertise to the dash cam world, with models featuring voice control and driver assistance warnings. For budget-conscious shoppers, 70Mai’s 4K Omni delivers impressive clarity and intelligent features in a compact design. VAVA’s Dual Dash Cam stands out for its innovative 360-degree swivel design and excellent night vision capabilities, making it ideal for rideshare drivers and those who frequently drive after dark. Whichever model you choose, a dash cam has become as essential to responsible vehicle ownership as insurance itself – a small investment that could potentially save you from major headaches and financial losses down the road. 4. Tracking Device The airline industry’s meltdown in recent years has turned what used to be a minor inconvenience into a full-blown crisis for travelers. In 2022, Heathrow Airport made headlines when a baggage system malfunction created mountains of abandoned luggage in Terminal 2, leaving thousands of passengers separated from their belongings. Just this past August, torrential rain and lightning strikes caused another luggage disaster at Britain’s busiest airport, with irate passengers reporting their bags never made it to their destinations. These aren’t isolated incidents – they’re symptoms of an overwhelmed system that’s becoming increasingly unreliable. Enter the smart tracking device – your personal insurance policy against the chaos of modern travel. These compact beacons have evolved far beyond simple Bluetooth tags, now offering precise location tracking across global networks, extended battery life, and sophisticated alert systems. Whether attached to your luggage, slipped into a wallet, or clipped to a pet’s collar, these devices provide real-time location data directly to your smartphone, giving you peace of mind and a fighting chance to recover your belongings when systems fail. The latest generation of trackers offers features that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years ago. Take the innovative PhotoTag that we featured earlier this year. Unlike conventional trackers, the PhotoTag incorporates an E-ink display that can display a photo, contact information, or custom message – making it instantly recognizable and increasing the chances of recovery. Priced at just $29, it combines the location precision of premium trackers with a customizable display that serves as a visual identifier, perfect for luggage, pets, or even keeping tabs on young children in crowded spaces. When shopping for a tracker, consider network compatibility (Apple’s Find My network or Android’s Find My Device), battery life (replaceable batteries typically last longer), range, water resistance, and alert options. Reliable options include Apple’s AirTag for iPhone users, Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTag for Android enthusiasts, and offerings from Chipolo and Tile for cross-platform compatibility. Some models even include additional features like separation alerts that notify you when you’ve left something behind or crowd-finding capabilities that anonymously enlist other users’ devices to help locate your missing items. 5. GaN Charger The days of carrying multiple chargers, each with their own bulky power brick and tangled cable, are officially behind us. GaN (Gallium Nitride) technology has revolutionized the charging landscape, replacing the traditional silicon components with a material that conducts electricity more efficiently, generates less heat, and allows for dramatically smaller form factors. What once required a charger the size of a deck of cards can now fit in your palm, all while delivering more power than ever before. It’s the kind of technological leap that makes you wonder how we ever tolerated the alternatives. Modern GaN chargers pack an astonishing amount of power into incredibly compact designs. A single brick the size of a credit card (just slightly thicker) can simultaneously charge your laptop, phone, tablet, and earbuds – effectively replacing four separate chargers with one elegant solution. With power outputs ranging from 65W to over 200W, these chargers can handle everything from power-hungry gaming laptops to the most demanding creative workstations. The days of lugging around that massive proprietary laptop power brick are over; most GaN chargers now support universal USB-C Power Delivery, compatible with virtually any modern device. The efficiency gains extend beyond size and convenience – GaN chargers are significantly more energy-efficient. They waste less electricity as heat, which means faster charging times, lower electricity bills, and less environmental impact. Many models feature intelligent power distribution, automatically adjusting the output to each connected device based on its specific needs. This smart power management ensures your laptop gets the high wattage it requires while simultaneously providing the optimal charging rate for more sensitive devices like smartphones. Industry leader Anker has been at the forefront of this revolution with their Nano and Prime series, offering exceptional reliability and safety features. Satechi’s GaN charger line combines cutting-edge technology with sleek design aesthetics that complement premium devices. For those seeking alternatives, other players like UGREEN have begun entering the market with their Nexode chargers, though they still have a long way to go to match established brands like Anker, Belkin, and Satechi. Meanwhile, innovative startups like ChargeAsap have pushed boundaries with ultra-compact designs that somehow manage to pack in even more ports and power. Whichever brand you choose, a quality GaN charger simplifies your tech life while future-proofing your charging needs for years to come. 6. Crypto Hardware Wallet Remember when we used to keep our spare change in a piggy bank? Those ceramic pigs felt like impenetrable fortresses, guarding our precious coins from sticky-fingered siblings. Fast forward to 2025, and we’re dealing with digital assets worth thousands, sometimes millions. Yet, many of us still treat our crypto like loose change in our pockets. The crypto world has seen its fair share of disasters, from the FTX collapse in 2022 to Binance’s legal troubles in 2023. These weren’t isolated incidents – they were wake-up calls. Our digital piggy banks aren’t as secure as we thought. Enter the crypto hardware wallet – the modern-day equivalent of burying your treasure in the backyard, but infinitely more sophisticated. These pocket-sized devices are like miniature vaults, keeping your private keys locked away from prying eyes and malicious code. They’re not connected to the internet, making them immune to online attacks that have plagued hot wallets and exchanges. When choosing a hardware wallet, look for military-grade encryption, support for multiple cryptocurrencies, and ease of use. The device should feel solid, with a clear display for verifying transactions. Reputable brands have stood the test of time and scrutiny. Ledger and Trezor are the veterans in this space, offering a range of options from beginner-friendly to advanced models. The Ledger Nano X, with its Bluetooth capability, strikes a balance between security and convenience. Trezor’s Model T, with its touchscreen interface, makes managing your crypto feel less like rocket science. Newer players like Ngrave and Coldcard cater to the paranoid among us, with features like air-gapped operations and open-source firmware. These might be overkill for casual investors, but for those holding significant assets, they offer peace of mind that’s hard to put a price on. Using a hardware wallet isn’t just about protecting your assets; it’s about embracing the core philosophy of cryptocurrency – decentralization and personal responsibility. When you use a hardware wallet, you’re not trusting an exchange or a company with your funds. You become your own bank, with all the power and responsibility that entails. The learning curve might seem steep at first. Setting up a hardware wallet feels a bit like preparing for a space mission – there are seed phrases to write down, firmware to update, and addresses to verify. But once you get past the initial setup, using your hardware wallet becomes second nature. The extra steps feel less like inconveniences and more like necessary precautions, like checking the locks before bed. In a world where digital assets are becoming increasingly mainstream, hardware wallets aren’t just for crypto enthusiasts anymore. They’re essential tools for anyone serious about protecting their digital wealth. 7. Hydroponic Planter I never considered myself someone with a major green thumb until I set up my first hydroponic planter last year. Within just four weeks, I was harvesting fresh basil for my pasta and plucking cherry tomatoes straight from my kitchen counter garden. The transformation was remarkable – from seeds to thriving plants with minimal effort on my part. The system handled all the complex variables like watering schedules, nutrient delivery, and light cycles, allowing me to enjoy the rewards of gardening without the traditional learning curve or maintenance headaches. Moreover, it makes eating healthy simpler, and CHEAPER, allowing you to get fresh farm-to-table produce simply by growing things yourself. Hydroponic systems have democratized gardening by removing the guesswork and physical labor that often discourages beginners. These water-based growing systems deliver nutrients directly to plant roots in precisely calibrated amounts, eliminating the need to master soil composition or watering frequencies. Their vertical design maximizes growing space – a unit with the footprint of a standard doormat can support 20-30 plants simultaneously, creating a lush garden in even the smallest apartments. Many modern systems include integrated LED lighting that mimics optimal sunlight conditions, allowing you to grow year-round regardless of your climate or available natural light. One significant advantage of hydroponics is the absence of soil, which eliminates the vast majority of pest problems that plague traditional gardens. Without soil, common garden pests like aphids, fungus gnats, and root-eating larvae simply can’t establish themselves. This soil-free approach also means no weeding, no muddy mess, and significantly less water consumption – most hydroponic systems use up to 95% less water than conventional gardening methods. The controlled environment creates ideal growing conditions that accelerate plant development while producing higher yields and more nutrient-dense produce. Entry-level hydroponic systems like AeroGarden and Click \u0026 Grow handle the basics of automated watering and lighting for around $100-200, making them perfect for herbs and small vegetables. Mid-range options from brands like Tower Garden and iDOO ($300-500) offer expanded capacity and more sophisticated nutrient delivery systems. At the cutting edge, the Gardyn system I saw at CES 2025 represents the future of home agriculture. Its AI-powered growing assistant uses cameras to monitor plant health, automatically adjusts growing conditions, and even sends notifications when plants need attention or are ready to harvest. At $700-900, these advanced systems represent a significant investment, but for households spending $200+ monthly on produce, they can pay for themselves within a year while providing fresher, more nutritious food than anything available at supermarkets.",

If your homes can have advanced surveillance systems, why can’t your car? Whether it’s recording something as absurd as a meteor crash (remember that dashcam footage from Russia 10 years ago?) or recording footage to avoid liability in the case of an accident, a dash cam is an absolute tech essential that I can’t recommend enough to people. With insurance fraud schemes becoming increasingly sophisticated and hit-and-run incidents on the rise, having video evidence of your driving can save you thousands in disputed claims. A quality dash cam serves as your silent, impartial witness on the road, documenting everything from fender benders to attempted insurance scams. In an age where video evidence often makes the difference between being found at fault or exonerated, this small device delivers peace of mind that far outweighs its cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eModern dashcams have transcended their simple recording origins to become smart devices packed with features that enhance both safety and convenience. Look for models with high-resolution recording (at least 1440p) for capturing license plate details, wide dynamic range (WDR) for balanced exposure in challenging lighting conditions, and GPS for tracking location and speed data. Advanced features worth considering include parking mode (which activates when it detects motion while your car is parked), lane departure warnings, and collision detection. Some premium models even offer cloud connectivity, automatically uploading footage when incidents occur, ensuring your evidence is preserved even if your camera is damaged or stolen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstallation has become remarkably straightforward, with most models either attaching to your windshield via suction cups or adhesive mounts, or discreetly integrating with your rearview mirror. Power typically comes from your vehicle’s 12V outlet or can be hardwired to your car’s electrical system for a cleaner look and to enable parking mode. When selecting a dash cam, consider whether you want front-only recording or a dual-camera system that captures both front and rear views. For those living in extreme climates, look for models with good operating temperature ranges and capacitor-based power systems rather than batteries, which can fail in high heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrands like Nextbase have established themselves as leaders in the consumer dash cam market, with their Series 2 models offering excellent value and user-friendly interfaces. Blackvue’s DR900X series represents the premium end of the spectrum, with 4K recording and robust cloud connectivity features. Garmin’s Dash Cam series brings the company’s navigation expertise to the dash cam world, with models featuring voice control and driver assistance warnings.

Those ceramic pigs felt like impenetrable fortresses, guarding our precious coins from sticky-fingered siblings. Fast forward to 2025, and we’re dealing with digital assets worth thousands, sometimes millions. Yet, many of us still treat our crypto like loose change in our pockets. The crypto world has seen its fair share of disasters, from the FTX collapse in 2022 to Binance’s legal troubles in 2023. These weren’t isolated incidents – they were wake-up calls. Our digital piggy banks aren’t as secure as we thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnter the crypto hardware wallet – the modern-day equivalent of burying your treasure in the backyard, but infinitely more sophisticated. These pocket-sized devices are like miniature vaults, keeping your private keys locked away from prying eyes and malicious code. They’re not connected to the internet, making them immune to online attacks that have plagued hot wallets and exchanges. When choosing a hardware wallet, look for military-grade encryption, support for multiple cryptocurrencies, and ease of use. The device should feel solid, with a clear display for verifying transactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReputable brands have stood the test of time and scrutiny. Ledger and Trezor are the veterans in this space, offering a range of options from beginner-friendly to advanced models. The Ledger Nano X, with its Bluetooth capability, strikes a balance between security and convenience. Trezor’s Model T, with its touchscreen interface, makes managing your crypto feel less like rocket science. Newer players like Ngrave and Coldcard cater to the paranoid among us, with features like air-gapped operations and open-source firmware. These might be overkill for casual investors, but for those holding significant assets, they offer peace of mind that’s hard to put a price on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing a hardware wallet isn’t just about protecting your assets; it’s about embracing the core philosophy of cryptocurrency – decentralization and personal responsibility. When you use a hardware wallet, you’re not trusting an exchange or a company with your funds. You become your own bank, with all the power and responsibility that entails. The learning curve might seem steep at first. Setting up a hardware wallet feels a bit like preparing for a space mission – there are seed phrases to write down, firmware to update, and addresses to verify. But once you get past the initial setup, using your hardware wallet becomes second nature. The extra steps feel less like inconveniences and more like necessary precautions, like checking the locks before bed. In a world where digital assets are becoming increasingly mainstream, hardware wallets aren’t just for crypto enthusiasts anymore. They’re essential tools for anyone serious about protecting their digital wealth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e7.

Within just four weeks, I was harvesting fresh basil for my pasta and plucking cherry tomatoes straight from my kitchen counter garden. The transformation was remarkable – from seeds to thriving plants with minimal effort on my part. The system handled all the complex variables like watering schedules, nutrient delivery, and light cycles, allowing me to enjoy the rewards of gardening without the traditional learning curve or maintenance headaches. Moreover, it makes eating healthy simpler, and CHEAPER, allowing you to get fresh farm-to-table produce simply by growing things yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHydroponic systems have democratized gardening by removing the guesswork and physical labor that often discourages beginners. These water-based growing systems deliver nutrients directly to plant roots in precisely calibrated amounts, eliminating the need to master soil composition or watering frequencies. Their vertical design maximizes growing space – a unit with the footprint of a standard doormat can support 20-30 plants simultaneously, creating a lush garden in even the smallest apartments. Many modern systems include integrated LED lighting that mimics optimal sunlight conditions, allowing you to grow year-round regardless of your climate or available natural light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne significant advantage of hydroponics is the absence of soil, which eliminates the vast majority of pest problems that plague traditional gardens. Without soil, common garden pests like aphids, fungus gnats, and root-eating larvae simply can’t establish themselves. This soil-free approach also means no weeding, no muddy mess, and significantly less water consumption – most hydroponic systems use up to 95% less water than conventional gardening methods. The controlled environment creates ideal growing conditions that accelerate plant development while producing higher yields and more nutrient-dense produce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntry-level hydroponic systems like AeroGarden and Click \u0026amp; Grow handle the basics of automated watering and lighting for around $100-200, making them perfect for herbs and small vegetables.
