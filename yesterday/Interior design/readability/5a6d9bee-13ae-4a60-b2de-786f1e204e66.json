  "text": "Style: Manhattan Mist Color Combination: Cloud white, charcoal gray, misty gray, burgundy wine  Who is it for: For the high-rise dreamers who drink their espresso with a side of skyline. Those who appreciate the poetry of city lights through rain-streaked windows, and find comfort in the juxtaposition of plush serenity against urban energy.  Budget: $-$$ Manhattan Mist Living Room – Shopping List Below we present a curated list of products presented on the board: Tips and suggestions Colors That Work Together: Soft white upholstery creates an ethereal base that mirrors morning fog, while charcoal accents echo the city’s steel bones. Burgundy pillows add warmth like distant sunset reflections on glass towers. Window Treatment: Floor-to-ceiling smoky gray sheers frame Manhattan’s iconic skyline, creating a cinematic backdrop while softening harsh city light. Furniture Foundation: The oversized sectional in ribbed cream fabric offers cloud-like comfort while maintaining metropolitan sophistication. The black bar cabinet with gold hardware brings nightclub elegance to home entertaining. Art Curation: A carefully composed gallery wall mixes abstract forms with architectural sketches, creating a personal story that complements rather than competes with the window-framed city art. Lighting: Minimalist pendant lights with globe diffusers float like morning mist, while the articulating sconce adds targeted illumination for evening ambiance. Accent Pieces: The brass-framed glass coffee table reflects light like rain-slicked streets, while vintage-inspired vessels add collected sophistication. The Final Note: This living room feels like Manhattan in the early morning – peaceful yet powerful. With its mix of soft colors and city views, it creates a calm space that still captures New York’s energy. The room proves you can have both comfort and city sophistication in one space.",
