The Riviera Maya EDITION at Kanai Debuts Relaxed Luxury Take a trip down to Mexico’s Caribbean coastline for a serene stay at the Riviera Maya EDITION resort designed by the Ian Schrager Company in collaboration with the Rockwell Group. Nestled within a vast nature preserve at Kanai, the tranquil retreat honors the Yucatán Peninsula’s cultural heritage while providing guests with a picturesque escape that harmonizes luxury and nature. 9. Hedi Slimane Dazzles With Design for Celine Miami Flagship Hedi Slimane made his latest mark in Miami at the new Celine flagship showroom, a vision of luxury, elegance, and avant-garde design. The meticulously curated space harmoniously blends art, premium natural materials like gray travertine and grigio carnico marble, and custom-designed furniture, creating an impactful yet inviting atmosphere. This design not only showcases Slimane’s signature aesthetic but also offers visitors a refined, immersive, and ultimately memorable shopping experience. 8. Le Labo Reconnects With Their Wabi-Sabi Origins in New Kyoto Store Wabi-sabi, the Japanese philosophy embracing beauty in imperfection, finds a harmonious expression in Le Labo’s new Kyoto store, nestled within a meticulously preserved 145-year-old machiya townhouse. Designed by Schemata Architects, the space honors traditional architecture by retaining original elements like floors, walls, and framing, while incorporating Le Labo’s signature minimalist aesthetic. This direction creates a serene environment that reflects the brand’s commitment to craftsmanship and the wabi-sabi ethos. 7. A Long Island Home Seamlessly Blends Elegance With Functionality Designed by Monica Fried Design, with architecture by Mojo Stumer, the Old Westbury project is an example of how minimalism doesn’t need to lack warmth. The residence features clean lines and a neutral palette, complemented by natural materials like wood and stone, creating an inviting atmosphere. The space caters to the needs of a young family, offering a timeless and comfortable living space. 6. A Mid-Century Modern Inspired Apartment Overlooking the Water The Oceana Retreat is a minimalist residence designed by Hino Studio that seamlessly brings Latin American flair together with European mid-century aesthetics. The design sets the tone with a Gio Ponti–style entry foyer floor and a striking walnut slat arched screen that replaced a large wall to create an intimate yet open layout. The arch theme continues throughout the home, appearing in custom cabinetry, doorways, and other design details. 5. The Mulholland Home Is a Minimalist Mid-Century Gem in LA The Mulholland Home by Studio Qasabian is a minimalist mid-century gem perched in the Hollywood Hills. A stunning curation of vintage furnishings alongside bespoke pieces create a harmonious and sophisticated atmosphere. An art collection highlighting Armenian artists adds a personal touch, reflecting both the homeowners’ and designer’s heritage. 4. Quarters Emerges as a Symbol of New York’s Design Revival Quarters, an 8,000-square-foot space created by Felicia Hung and Nick Ozemba, founders of the lighting brand In Common With, is equal parts concept store, retail space, and community hub – all styled as a welcoming residence. Guests can explore this “public home,” which features a bedroom, kitchen, dining room, bar, lounge, library, and great room, each thoughtfully curated with furniture and decor. The collection includes a mix of vintage pieces and works by celebrated designers and artists such as Sophie Lou Jacobsen, Danny Kaplan, Shane Gabier, Simone Bodmer-Turner, and Claudio Bonuglia. 3. Betsy Brown Finds Enchantment in the Magic City’s Redmont Neighborhood In Birmingham’s historic Redmont neighborhood, designer Betsy Brown transformed a residence by seamlessly integrating elements inspired by the city’s industrial heritage, notably the iconic Sloss Furnace. The renovation accommodates an extensive art and photography collection, featuring vintage mid-century furnishings and cypress woodwork that harmonize with the home’s lush surroundings. Completed in just one year, the design reflects both the homeowner’s evolving collections and the rich cultural backdrop of Birmingham. 2. A Parisian Pied-à-Terre’s Merges Classic and Contemporary Designer Lichelle Silvestry renovated a historic pied-à-terre nestled in Le Marais, bringing a piece of the 17th century into the present. The top-floor apartment retains original features like exposed beams and a stone fireplace dating back to 1660, while introducing modern elements such as custom linen sofas and walnut coffee tables. This merging of old and new creates a serene retreat that reflects the building’s rich history and contemporary sophistication. And the most popular Skim Milk post of 2024 is… 1. A Residence That Casts Period Details Against Minimalist Backdrops Inspired by Japanese architect Kazuo Shinohara’s symmetrical spatial compositions, designer Oliver Du Puy transformed a historic Melbourne home, infusing light and vitality into its once dark and confined spaces. Natural materials and breathable finishes improve air quality, while sustainable practices like repurposed clay bricks and solar power reflect a deep commitment to environmental responsibility. The result is a home that radiates warmth, serenity, and effortless simplicity. Check out the rest of Design Milk’s end of the year coverage here!
