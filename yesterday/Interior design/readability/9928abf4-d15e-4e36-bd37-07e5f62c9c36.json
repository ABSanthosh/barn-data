  "description": "Is this something you've seen in America? I've just learned it's a thing in Canadian apartment and condo buildings to feature a bike-washing station. The one you see here is made by Canadian manufacturer Ridalco. The stainless steel sinks are seven feet wide and a little over two feet deep. A pair of protruding bars on either side can be used to hold your bike's wheels in place. A similar product with a different application: Another Canadian company called Furever Clean offers these dog washing tubs. As with the bike washing stations, they're offered as an amenity in some Canadian apartment buildings. There's a bit more actual design in these as opposed to the bike sink. Sizes range from about 32\" wide to five feet. There's a lift-in option for small dogs, and two versions with doors for large dogs, one with a step and the other with a ramp. Typically when you wash a dog in a bathtub, they can't gain good traction on the slippery tub floor. This often adds stress to what is already, at least for the dogs I've owned, an undesirable activity. To compensate, the sinks feature these rubbery drainage mats that allows the dog's paws to gain purchase. After draining through the mats, the water passes through this removable mesh basket. This catches dog hair, preventing it from clogging the drain. Along the back of the sink, you can see a rail to attach a tether to. There are also hang-on shelves to hold product. In addition to apartment buildings, the company also sells branded versions of these to dogcare businesses. The two products are close in material and scale. So I was surprised to see that Ridalco makes bike sinks but not dog sinks, and vice versa for Furever Clean. Perhaps they'd benefit from a merger.",
