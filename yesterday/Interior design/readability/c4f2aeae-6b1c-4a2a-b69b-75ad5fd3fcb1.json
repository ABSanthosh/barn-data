Aside from the fact that it’s easy to adapt this in actual production, it can also be sustainable and eventually impactful. Most of these 3D-printing concepts try to create something that’s recyclable or made from recycled materials therefore making it more sustainable than regular furniture. Designer: Ethan Solodukhin The Revo Chair Concept, with Revo meaning “revolutionary”, is a collection of 3D-printed furniture and is powered by the PlastiVista Atelier program. The program actually encourages homes, schools, and communities to donate their plastic waste and those that can be used for 3D printing converted into filament. The collection includes the Revo Chair and the Stoool (yes that’s not a typo). They are made from 100% recycled plastic. The Revo Chair uses a single-piece design and it can serve as both an actual chair but when used with a different orientation, it can also serve as storage. The photos show it’s a box-like storage although it’s not really shown how it can be turned into that although the surfaces can be something you can place objects on. The Stoool meanwhile just serves as a seat with its compact surface, although you can probably also use it as a side table if you want to. The renders of these chairs reminds me of those small, plastic phone holders that you can get for cheap. The question of course for these 3D-printed chairs would be if they are durable enough and comfortable enough for people to sit in for a long period of time.",
