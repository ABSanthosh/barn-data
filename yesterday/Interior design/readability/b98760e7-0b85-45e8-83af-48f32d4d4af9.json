The Taiwan-Reyhanli Centre for World Citizens was named architecture project of the year, Aesop Diagonal best interior of the year and the Faneeri folding chair design project of the year. We also announced the Dezeen Awards 2024 Designers of the Year and Fernando Laposse was named the winner of the Bentley Lighthouse Award 2024. Audi ditched its distinctive four-ring logoIn design, car brand Audi ditched its distinctive four-ring logo for its Chinese electric car range, which instead features an all-caps AUDI wordmark. The rebrand follows Jaguar revealing a new visual identity last week. In an opinion piece, design writer Sophie Tolhurst said \"the future Jaguar is offering feels baffling rather than visionary\". We investigated the problem of polyurethane foamAlso in design, Dezeen reporter Jane Englefield investigated the \"knotty problem\" of polyurethane foam in the soft furniture industry. A firm favourite for over half a century, the versatile material has dominated the industry since the late 1950s, but has serious sustainability issues. Foam is a \"significant environmental and safety problem\", according to Celine Sandberg, founder of all-women-run Norwegian biofoam manufacturer Agoprene. \"Polyurethane is the product of two petrochemicals, derived as by-products of the petroleum industry, which makes it extremely affordable but highly polluting,\" she said. A social housing project in Barcelona won RIBA's International PrizeIn architecture news, the 85 Social Dwellings in Cornellà social housing project in Barcelona, Spain, was named the world's best building by RIBA. Designed by Peris + Toral Arquitectes, the building has a modular timber framework and was described by the judges as \"inclusive and sustainable\". Kengo Kuma designed a pair of Christmas treesWith December beginning next week, we also featured a selection of design-led Christmas trees from around the world, including a pair designed by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma for the Edition hotels in Tokyo. In London, designer Anna Lomax reimagined a Christmas tree as a twisting column for the V\u0026A, while artist Liz West designed a neon Christmas tree in King's Cross. We highlighted 15 Indian furniture and homeware brandsThis week, we also spotlighted 15 Indian furniture and homeware brands worth knowing. According to a recent IMARC Group report, India's design market will grow from $31.5 billion in 2023 to $67.4 billion in 2032, and these studios are looking to make their mark. A chapel in the Czech Republic was one of this week's most popular projects Popular projects featured on Dezeen this week included a chapel in the Czech Republic, a cube-shaped church and community centre in Gothenburg, Sweden, and a timber-framed interior for a home on a Croatian island. This week's lookbooks featured stylish kitchens with metallic gold surfaces in unexpected places and bedrooms with bedside tables that add a modern touch.
