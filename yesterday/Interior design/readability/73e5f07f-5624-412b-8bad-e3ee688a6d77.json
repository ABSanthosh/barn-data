It’s the follow-up to the Starry Night set back in 2021, which has around 1,552 pieces. The company reproduces the artwork in blocks in collaboration with the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. In this way, LEGO captures the details of Vincent Van Gogh’s Sunflowers (1889) painting, from the brushstrokes to the number of petals.There are 2,615 pieces in the set, and they evoke three different shades of yellow just like in the painting. The LEGO Vincent Van Gogh Sunflowers set features 16 sunflowers with adjustable petals, a removable frame, a hanger element to affix the end result on a wall, as well as a tile with the artist’s signature. The set is available for purchase starting March 2025, with a brick LEGO installation set to be on view in the Van Gogh Museum from June 2025.all images courtesy of the LEGO Grouptranslating the impasto effect of the artwork into bricksThe LEGO blocks for the Vincent Van Gogh Sunflowers set are tactile and detailed. The disk florets, for example, have triangular, shard-like pieces to depict the petals. The design team also recreates the brushstrokes of the other flowers in the painting with pieces that are shaped like chili peppers. They clinch on the removable frame as a design accent to the overall canvas. For the vase, the company adds a tile with Vincent Van Gogh’s signature in a light blue color, completing the ensemble of his LEGO Sunflowers set.LEGO Designer Stijn Oom says that the design team has collaborated with the Van Gogh Museum and its experts for the 3D version of the original artwork. In the end, they’re able to translate the impasto effect of the artwork into the LEGO Sunflowers set, which creates the balanced composition of the painting. To celebrate the launch of the set, the LEGO Group has made two lifestyle brick replicas of the painting, which is set for a permanent display in the LEGO Store in Amsterdam and the Van Gogh Museum. LEGO reproduces the artwork in blocks in collaboration with the Van Gogh Museum in AmsterdamBrick-built installation on display in the museumA brick-built LEGO installation is also on view in the Van Gogh Museum between June and August 2025.
