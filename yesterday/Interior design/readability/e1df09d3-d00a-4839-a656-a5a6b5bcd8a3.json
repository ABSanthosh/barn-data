By merging Japanese cultural traditions with modern innovation, the QX80 exemplifies a bold vision of luxury and performance. From its commanding exterior to its meticulously crafted interior, every detail reflects Infiniti’s dedication to blending artistry with functionality. Designer: Infiniti Exterior Design: Bold and Dynamic The QX80’s exterior embodies strength and sophistication, with a design inspired by elements of Japanese culture. Its signature double-arch grille takes cues from the organic forms of a bamboo forest, evoking both resilience and elegance. Flanking the grille are multi-element LED daytime running lights that further emphasize the bamboo motif, seamlessly blending natural inspiration with cutting-edge technology. Photo: Zack Fistrovich The front lighting system continues this narrative, designed to mimic the keys of a grand piano, adding a touch of musicality to the QX80’s visual identity. At the rear, a full-width LED lighting element features over 300 LEDs inspired by the shimmering reflections of light on water. This detail brings a sense of fluidity and motion to the vehicle’s bold silhouette. Photo: Zack Fistrovich The QX80’s long, nearly flat hood leads into crisp shoulder lines, creating an “anti-wedge” profile that projects sleek motion even when stationary. Flush door handles, which automatically present themselves upon unlocking, contribute to a clean, aerodynamic appearance, while harmonious character lines running along the profile add depth and balance to the design. Interior Design: A Harmonious Blend of Style and Comfort Inside, the QX80 offers a cabin designed to immerse passengers in luxury. Infiniti’s adherence to the Japanese aesthetic principle of Miyabi—emphasizing elegance and refinement—is evident throughout the interior. High-quality materials, intricate craftsmanship, and thoughtful details come together to create a space that is as durable as it is beautiful. The use of custom-fit seat materials in the QX80 enhances its interior with a refined touch of ingenuity and practicality. Available in Graphite and Tuscan Beige, TailorFit upholstery provides a balance of comfort, durability, and longevity, ensuring the cabin remains stylish and functional even after years of use. Its inclusion alongside other premium options like semi-aniline leather underscores its luxurious nature, making it both elegant and practical for daily life. The material’s name suggests a tailored fit, adding a layer of personalization that complements the vehicle’s premium positioning. TailorFit contributes to the QX80’s interior by offering an elegant yet functional choice for occupants. For those who seek a more traditional luxury option, semi-aniline leather upholstery is available in Graphite and Sepia Brown. Infiniti also offers quilted semi-aniline leather, which enhances the interior’s sophistication. This premium material, available in Graphite and Burgundy, features a unique dot-quilting pattern that is partially completed by hand, adding a bespoke quality to the design. This attention to detail enhances the overall refinement of the cabin, showcasing Infiniti’s commitment to craftsmanship. The interior’s luxurious ambiance is further heightened by the use of wood trims and metal accents. Open-pore ash wood is prominently featured throughout the cabin, lending a natural warmth to the design. In higher trims, metal-inlay open-pore wood elevates the aesthetic with its intricate detailing. Laser-cut aluminum inlays provide a modern complement to these traditional materials, creating a harmonious balance of textures and finishes. The inclusion of matte and dark matte chrome accents adds subtle sophistication, blending seamlessly with the overall design. Passenger comfort is prioritized through the thoughtful application of soft-touch materials. These are strategically layered over hard surfaces, particularly in areas where arms and elbows may rest. This approach not only enhances the tactile experience but also ensures a sense of coziness and refinement for everyone in the vehicle. Additional premium materials, such as suede and plush fabrics, are incorporated throughout the cabin to complete the QX80’s inviting interior. These materials are used alongside leather and wood elements to create a cohesive and opulent environment. From the dashboard to the door panels and all three rows of seating, the meticulous integration of these materials ensures that every detail contributes to the vehicle’s luxurious atmosphere. A Modern Take on Technology The QX80 integrates advanced technology seamlessly into its luxurious interior. A dual 14.3-inch Monolith infotainment display anchors the dashboard, providing intuitive access to navigation, entertainment, and vehicle controls. Personalized ambient lighting with 64 color options lets passengers create a cabin atmosphere to suit their preferences, enhancing every journey. Creative features like the INFINITI Light Path bring a modern interpretation of omotenashi—the Japanese principle of hospitality. This system illuminates the ground near the vehicle as passengers approach, creating a welcoming environment that sets the tone for every drive. Aural Perfection: The Klipsch Experience The partnership with Klipsch brings outstanding audio quality to the QX80. The Klipsch Reference Premiere Audio System includes 24 speakers, titanium tweeters, an 8-inch TriPower subwoofer, and a 1,200-watt amplifier. This setup creates an immersive auditory experience, ensuring that every drive feels like a private concert. Even the exterior design reinforces this focus on sensory harmony. The front lighting, inspired by piano keys, complements the auditory experience by blending visual elegance with the QX80’s grand presence. A Celebration of Japanese Culture The 2025 Infiniti QX80 is a rolling tribute to Japanese heritage. Its bamboo-inspired grille symbolizes strength and adaptability, while its rear taillights, sculpted to reflect the grandeur of Tokyo’s skyline, celebrate the country’s modernity. The interior materials, from TailorFit upholstery to open-pore wood, echo the natural beauty and craftsmanship synonymous with Japanese design. Every detail, from the personalized ambient lighting to the handcrafted leather upholstery, reflects Infiniti’s commitment to excellence. The QX80 is a journey through tradition, innovation, and artistry. The Autograph Edition: Pinnacle of the QX80 Lineup Our drive experience at Design Miami featured the 2025 Infiniti QX80 Autograph edition, which represents the pinnacle of luxury and features in the QX80 lineup. This trim level offers exclusive enhancements that set it apart from other models in the range, making it the ultimate choice for those seeking the best in style, comfort, and technology. Photo: Zack Fistrovich The Autograph edition’s interior showcases premium craftsmanship and advanced amenities. Quilted semi-aniline leather seats envelop all three rows, providing a sumptuous seating experience. Massaging second-row seats add an extra layer of comfort, while heated third-row seats ensure every passenger enjoys premium amenities. A front-console cooling compartment and a cabin camera for viewing rear passengers enhance practicality and convenience for daily use. Photo:Zack Fistrovich On the exterior, the Autograph edition is distinguished by its two-tone roof design and dark chrome exterior trim, which exude an aura of sophistication. Unique 22-inch machine-finished wheels complete the look, ensuring the Autograph edition commands attention wherever it goes. The Autograph trim also boasts a suite of cutting-edge technologies. It comes standard with ProPILOT Assist 2.1, a hands-free driver-assist system for select highways that advances safety and convenience on long drives. A second-row touchscreen display adds a touch of modernity for passengers, while the 24-speaker Klipsch Reference Premiere Audio System ensures unparalleled sound quality throughout the cabin. This trim level delivers exceptional performance, featuring a 450-horsepower twin-turbo V6 engine paired with all-wheel drive. Advanced suspension systems ensure a smooth and controlled ride, whether navigating city streets or exploring off-road trails. With a starting MSRP of $112,590, the Autograph edition represents the epitome of luxury in the QX80 lineup, justifying its position as the top-tier model with exclusive design elements and comfort enhancements. Driving the 2025 INFINITI QX80 Autograph Edition delivers a harmonious blend of luxury and power, as Zack Fistrovich experienced firsthand at Design Miami, where he represented Yanko Design alongside Infiniti. His encounter with the QX80 allowed him to explore its balance of craftsmanship and performance, emphasizing how its design complements the driving experience. The QX80’s imposing size is immediately apparent, spanning 17.5 feet in length and weighing around 5,800 pounds. Its commanding presence provides a high driving position, offering excellent visibility of the road ahead. However, for those unfamiliar with full-sized SUVs, navigating its substantial dimensions can feel intimidating, especially in urban settings or tighter spaces. Surprisingly, it feels much nimbler than its size and appearance suggest, maintaining a sense of agility that enhances the driving experience. Under the hood, the twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 engine produces 450 horsepower, delivering brisk and responsive acceleration. The 9-speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly, ensuring a refined drive whether accelerating onto highways or cruising long stretches. With an estimated 0-60 mph time of about 5.3 seconds, the QX80 feels remarkably capable for its size. It also boasts a towing capacity of up to 8,500 pounds, underscoring its practicality for those who require utility alongside sophistication. The ride reflects its body-on-frame construction, which imparts a truck-like feel, further enhanced by the standard air suspension on all but the base trim. This setup effectively controls body motions and enhances overall comfort, though some body roll remains noticeable during cornering. Rougher pavement can result in a firmer ride, which stands out given the QX80’s otherwise smooth and composed highway demeanor. Steering, especially in tight situations like parking, requires effort, but the braking system instills confidence, managing the vehicle’s substantial weight effectively. Photo: Zack Fistrovich Inside the cabin, the level of refinement is notable. Road and wind noise are kept to a minimum, even at highway speeds, creating a serene environment. The engine remains impressively quiet, even under heavy acceleration, contributing to the sense of sophistication during longer drives. The overall comfort of the QX80 makes it an excellent option for extended journeys or everyday commutes. Driver assistance features like ProPilot Assist 2.1 offer hands-free highway driving, though Zack noted that occasional intervention was necessary to maintain confidence in its operation. Forward collision warning and lane departure prevention function effectively, adding an extra layer of reassurance to the driving experience. Zack’s time behind the wheel of the QX80 Autograph Edition at Design Miami highlighted Infiniti’s attention to detail in balancing size, performance, and luxury. While its size and weight are apparent in certain driving situations, the overall experience reflects the thoughtful design and engineering behind this flagship SUV. The 2025 Infiniti QX80 reimagines the luxury SUV, merging timeless Japanese traditions with the demands of modern drivers. From its bold exterior to its exquisitely crafted interior, the QX80 offers a driving experience that inspires and elevates the senses. Whether navigating city streets or embarking on long journeys, the QX80 stands as a testament to Infiniti’s dedication to creating vehicles that embody beauty, strength, and innovation.",
