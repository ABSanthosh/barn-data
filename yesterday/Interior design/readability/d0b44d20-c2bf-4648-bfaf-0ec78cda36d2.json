  "text": "shigeki yamamoto unveils eclectic tables at dutch design weekDuring Dutch Design Week 2024, Shigeki Yamamoto presents the Play Memory Structure coffee tables as part of his NEW PLAY series. On view from 19th to 27th October at Piet Hein Eek’s gallery in Eindhoven, the eclectic works explore themes of memory, life, and the animating force behind objects.The vibrant tables are composed of elements from Yamamoto’s previous creations alongside materials sourced from flea markets, roadside finds, and gifted objects. Each item carries its own history, much like a frame in an animation sequence, and when combined, they create a playful, cohesive structure. The resulting compositions invite viewers to project their own memories and interpretations onto the work, allowing the tables to ‘come alive’ with new meaning through the eyes of different observers.all images courtesy of Shigeki YamamotoPlay Memory Structure tables are infused with lifeShigeki Yamamoto’s design philosophy is grounded in the belief that objects can carry a soul or memory — a concept that draw from the Latin term ‘animare,’ meaning ‘to bring life to something.’ In this sense, an object now has ‘anima’ — a soul or life force. The Berlin-based designer draws parallels with this idea to animated movies, where still images, when viewed in succession, come to life, and create the illusion of movement. Each single drawing then tells a story, embedded with a deeper narrative meaning. Similarly, each component of his Play Memory Structure holds its own story.‘I have always been fascinated by the idea that all physical things could contain some sort of ‘life’ or ‘anima’, which turns rather ordinary objects into something meaningful that deserves to be treated with a certain amount of respect,’ Yamamoto shares. His initial Play Anima Sculptures, from which the Play Memory Structure tables extend, originated from the idea of giving new life to leftover pieces from his old works. One which already carried a meaning or memory.Shigeki Yamamoto presents the Play Memory Structure coffee tablesthe eclectic works explore themes of memory, life, and the animating force behind objectsthe vibrant tables are composed of elements from Shigeki Yamamoto’s previous creations and roadside findseach item carries its own history, much like a frame in an animation sequenceviewers are invited to project their own memories and interpretations onto the workhis initial Play Anima Sculptures leads to his Play Memory Structure tablesunveiled at Dutch Design Week 2024on view from 19th to 27th October at Piet Hein Eek’s gallery in EindhovenPlay Memory Structure coffee table Nr14",
