  "text": "In times of disaster, every second counts. However, for individuals with myopia, the absence of corrective lenses can significantly hinder their ability to navigate and make life-saving decisions. Recognizing this challenge, “Three Days to See” introduces an innovative solution: emergency glasses designed to provide immediate and adjustable vision correction in critical moments. Designer: Song Zetong, Deng Chenxi, Fan Yichen, Luo Yutong, and Du ChenChen Myopia, commonly known as nearsightedness, is a vision condition where distant objects appear blurry due to light focusing in front of the retina rather than directly on it. This condition affects millions worldwide, and those who rely on prescription glasses face an additional layer of vulnerability in emergencies. Whether fleeing a natural disaster, evacuating from a fire, or responding to an accident, the ability to see clearly is essential for survival. Stress and panic are natural responses to emergency situations. Under such pressure, individuals often forget essential items, including their glasses. Without proper vision, tasks as simple as reading signs, following escape routes, or identifying dangers become nearly impossible. This can lead to an increased risk of injury, delayed response times, and heightened anxiety. Another common issue is that many people have loose-fitting glasses, which can easily fall off during evacuation, further complicating their ability to navigate and respond to emergencies. “Three Days to See” addresses this issue by offering a practical and accessible alternative for those who need immediate vision correction. The key innovation behind “Three Days to See” is its ability to provide rapid and customizable vision correction without the need for prescription lenses. These emergency glasses use soft liquid lenses filled with highly refractive silicone oil. Users can adjust the diopter in five increments by pressing fluid-filled sacs integrated into the frame. This simple mechanism allows individuals with varying degrees of myopia to quickly obtain clear vision without the need for traditional glasses or professional adjustments. Additionally, these glasses feature a strong adhesive at the center of the top frame, which sticks to the forehead, securing the glasses in place without relying on traditional side arms. This design eliminates issues of improper fit caused by varying head sizes and prevents the glasses from slipping off during sudden movements or evacuations. By resting on the nose and being anchored by the forehead adhesive, the glasses provide a stable and comfortable fit for different users. Designed to be included in emergency kits, these glasses serve as a crucial survival tool. Their lightweight and durable construction ensures they can be stored for extended periods without deterioration. Whether used in a home emergency preparedness kit, workplace safety gear, or humanitarian aid packages, these glasses provide a much-needed solution for myopic individuals facing unpredictable situations. Beyond the physical advantage of restored vision, “Three Days to See” also addresses the psychological impact of emergencies. Vision impairment in high-stress scenarios can lead to disorientation, frustration, and a sense of helplessness. By equipping individuals with the ability to see clearly, these glasses help maintain confidence, reduce anxiety, and improve decision-making under pressure. From a broader perspective, accessible emergency vision correction aligns with the growing focus on inclusive disaster preparedness. By considering the needs of individuals with myopia, “Three Days to See” contributes to a more comprehensive approach to emergency response, ensuring that no one is left at a disadvantage when it matters most.",
