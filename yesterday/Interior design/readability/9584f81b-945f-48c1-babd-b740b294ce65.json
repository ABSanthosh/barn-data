  "text": "In 1978, Space Invaders launched an arcade revolution that would forever change entertainment. Today, Nubeo’s collaboration with TAITO transforms that digital legacy into a sophisticated timepiece that speaks volumes about how cultural touchstones evolve. Having handled many gaming-inspired watches over the years, I can say this limited edition collection – particularly the Plasma Pink variant – stands out for its thoughtful execution and genuine horological merit. Dive beneath the crystal, and you’ll discover a mechanical theater performing an endless show. The dial is an engineering feat of layered brilliance – each element floating above the next like alien spacecraft in formation. The outermost ring commands the hours, while a ghostly semi-transparent plate hovers mysteriously below. Further down, a minutes disc keeps its steady orbit, all circling around the star of the show: a seconds disc featuring that infamous squid invader, forever poised to unleash its pixelated assault. Designers: Nubeo Watches \u0026 TAITO There’s something deeply poetic about choosing the squid invader – or “Ika” as it’s known in Japanese – as the timepiece’s central character. Veterans of the original game will remember this pint-sized menace, with its triangular head and quartet of tentacles, as the most challenging target to hit. Now, instead of dodging player fire, it perpetually circles the dial in a mesmerizing dance of nostalgia and precision engineering. The watch comes in four color-ways, limited to 125 units each. Shown here is the Plasma Pink (which is the only one that isn’t sold out), but you also have Solar Yellow, Galaxy Green, and Invader Indigo – all neon colors that really capture the vibrant 8-bit visual tapestry that was this game. The straps are made from silicone, and blend right into the watch’s body, creating a smooth appearance that sort of contrasts against the jagged pixelated forms of the characters in the game. From a technical standpoint, the engineering achievements here are significant. Creating a multi-layered dial while maintaining reliable timekeeping requires precise calculations and exceptional manufacturing tolerance. Each layer must be perfectly weighted and balanced to prevent interference with the movement below. The semi-transparent elements add another layer of complexity, requiring special materials that maintain structural integrity while allowing light to pass through. On top, a domed mineral lens almost mimics the feeling of a CRT display, which was the dominant display technology during the time! The ‘Ika’ and numerals are all luminous, although they don’t glow in the same neon colors as their original paint-job. The decision to limit each colorway to 125 pieces reflects an understanding of both collector culture and market dynamics. It’s enough to make the watch accessible to serious enthusiasts while maintaining exclusivity. This number also allows for proper quality control – crucial for a design with such complex construction. That exclusivity is also paired with the fact that the watches are currently available for a heavily discounted price of just $200. I’d grab one instantly if I were you! A transparent exhibition window on the back lets you view the automatic movement on the inside. The watch exemplifies how digital culture can be transformed into mechanical art. Every element serves both aesthetic and functional purposes, from the layered construction that creates depth to the precise positioning of gaming elements that enhance rather than impede timekeeping. Each watch comes in a special Space Invaders box with neon artwork that glows under a blacklight. The watches are rated with 5 ATM of water resistance, and ship with a 2 year warranty.",
