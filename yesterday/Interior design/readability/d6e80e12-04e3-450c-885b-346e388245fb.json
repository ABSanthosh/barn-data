We even have a dedicated work chat titled ‘things I want to buy’, where we frequently share what each of us has on our wishlist. And alongside clothes or homewares, affordable artwork is something we always have our eyes on. In the spirit of helping you find the perfect piece for your home, we’re letting you shop our carts below, with a list of the best affordable artworks we’re loving right now — and they are all priced under $2000! WrittenbyChristina KarrasLucy Feagins, Editor What do you look for in art for your home? Generally, it’s just a feeling! When I see a painting or piece of artwork that captures my curiosity and makes me think, that’s what draws me in. I’m at a stage in my life where I really don’t need anything new, but… you never stop keeping an eye out and coveting new pieces! What artists are you loving right now? I love the slightly abstract beach scenes of Ella Holme’s Dusk series, and Emily Waugh’s landscape paintings, especially this one entitled Eastward On The Bellinger River — the brushstrokes are so energetic and confident. I’ve also been loving Kathryn Dolby’s paintings for a while now, she has such a unique way of capturing the Australian landscape. Bea Taylor, Managing Editor What do you look for in art for your home? I’m first and foremost drawn to colour. I love soft, gentle hues! Until this year, I favoured still-life artworks, but I’m beginning to see the spots for a few abstracts to break up the beautiful vignettes. Who are the artists you’re loving right now? Emmanuelle McGlade’s pieces speak to me! I adore the way she uses colour, especially in her pencil works where it’s layered and complex. I could look at them all day. Elynor Smithwick is another artist whose works tick all the boxes for colour, texture and subject. It’s difficult to make brushstrokes look as good as she does — there’s a beautiful movement to each piece. Sarah Hendriks, Art Director What do you look for in art for your home? I’m really drawn to pieces that use layer and texture and have an element of whimsy. In general, for me it’s more about finding a space for the artwork rather than searching for something to fill a particular spot. Who are the artists you’re loving right now? I am loving Ella Dunn’s recent works and the way she captures everyday moments and movements of people. I really love the way she uses scale, perspective and colour. Alicia Bilyara Bennett is a Barkindji / Ngalakan artist who I have recently discovered whose work I has a lovely earthly serenity about them. And each of Mark Bo Chu’s pieces have such a familiarity to them, almost as if I have lived that exact single fleeting moment or I will in the future. I really relish these small, everyday moments. Amelia Barnes, Writer What do you look for in art for your home? Nearly all the artwork in my home has ties to a holiday I’ve been on, a date with my husband, or a favourite local venue. I also have a thing for windows… maybe because my house has very few! Price is another a big factor at this stage of my life, so I love trawling Instagram for up-and-coming artists who directly sell framed paintings under the $500 mark. Every artwork I own except one fits into this category! Who are the artists you’re loving right now?  I’ve never met John Poole, but I feel like we share an affinity for the same locations, from the Italian Riviera to Sydney’s ocean pools, and diners in regional NSW. His artworks are accessible and generally really affordable, so they’re a great entry point for a first time art buyer. Susan Shortridge is an artist I began following on Instagram who paints very sweet, mostly still life scenes. Based on a photo she saw on my Instagram, she recently recreated the table where my husband proposed into a painting I will treasure forever! Christina Karras, Writer and Producer What do you look for in art for your home? I’m a big fan of still-life artworks, abstract paintings, and weavings. A lot of pieces I’ve bought or have on my wishlist incorporate warm colours (pink is an accidental, reoccurring theme) but I’m trying to diversify my collection a bit — every piece I buy, I’m aiming to hang in my future home one day! Who are the artists you’re loving right now, and why? Sydney artist Phoebe Stone has such a talent for capturing still-life moments with oil pastels, and I have soft spot for the tablescapes she often depicts, or this one featuring a bucket of my favourite of chips! I’m also obsessed with all the colour combinations in Louise Knowles‘ abstract paintings. Bluethumb is one of my favourite places to find artworks by unknown artists at great prices, including this tiny daffodil painting by Reeva Ashton. Georgie Rose, Account Manager What do you look for in art for your home?  I’m most drawn to pieces that either unlock a certain feeling or memory that I can relate to in some way or another. My favourite piece of art that I own is a piece by John Poole, which reminds me of my Nan’s property up north. Who are the artists you’re loving right now, and why? I am a sucker for anything that reminds me of summer and being by a body of water. That’s why I love any artwork by Jen Tarry-Smith, Matilda Walsh and Douglas Schofield. They all have such a unique style, yet they all perfectly capture this calm and warm feeling. Alice Ziebell, Partnerships Manager What do you look for in art for your home? I always want our home to feel homely, loved and cosy. I’m firstly drawn to things that are simply beautiful to look at. But if the piece can make me feel something or remind me of a meaningful moment or a specific time in my life, then it is extra special. Nature is a big source of inspiration for me too. Who are the artists you’re loving right now, and why? I am forever in awe of Lucy Hersey’s beautiful creations. Lucy lives in South Gippsland too (like me!) and has a way of capturing its landscapes of rolling hills so aptly. She collects rocks, clay and other natural materials to make her own paint, and I love the feeling they convey and how grounded they are in a sense of place. I love artist Mirador’s work, which often depicts ordinary moments from everyday life. More recently her paintings capture a feeling of motherhood and life with young children, distilling what can often be overlooked moments in the business of life and family. They’re a nice reminder to treasure these moments! Chelsea Hall, Advertising and Sponsorships Manager What do you look for in art for your home? At the moment, I’m loving works that reference nature — whether it’s the scene, the colour palette, or the actual subject. The art in our home is a collection of things we’ve loved over the years. There’s no theme, but every piece evokes a feeling and transports me to the place or mood of the time. Who are the artists you’re loving right now? Ash Leslie’s work for its calming, soft earthy tones, and how it evokes a feeling of peace and transports me to nature. Mangala woman and artist Maggie Green is also someone who’s work I always love for her inspiring use of colour. Lisa Nelson, Designer What do you look for in art for your home? I feel it’s often less about the immediate visual appeal or conventional aesthetic of an artwork, and more about the story and process behind it. Having studied and worked in the creative field, I’ve developed a deep appreciation for the process of making art — how it came to be, the techniques involved. Who are the artists you’re loving right now? I’ve been loving more realistic works of flora by Barwon Heads artist Deb Fisher, specifically her coral and ocean based pieces. I also have an eye on Sydney-based artist, William Versace — his unique techniques and mediums create beautiful and interesting textural and colourful pieces. Recent Shopping",
