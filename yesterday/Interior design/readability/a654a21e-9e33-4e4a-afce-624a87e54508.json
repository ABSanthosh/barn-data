  "description": "Niigata, Japan gets a lot of snow. Way back in the 1960s, they figured out a way to keep the roads clear of snow without requiring plows. Groundwater warmed by geothermal heat is pumped through a network of pipes below the road surface, and sprayed onto the asphalt using sprinklers:The system is called shosetsu. Because the warmed water flows along the grade of the roads, it doesn't freeze and turn into ice—at least in Niigata, where the temperatures don't often dip below the freezing point. (Icy Hokkaido, where the system is not in use, would be a different story.)Niigata reportedly has some 571 kilometers (355 miles) of roadways equipped with shosetsu.It's better on cars than salt.",
