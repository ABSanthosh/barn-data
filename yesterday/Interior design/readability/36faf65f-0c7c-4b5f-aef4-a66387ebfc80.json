  "text": "Thanks for stopping by for this week’s Style Scouting. My Sunday post where I share the random stuff that captured my attention or inspired me that I found online. As the saying goes… Spring has sprung. Colors are popping up everywhere I look. It is so nice to see after the drab colors of the winter months. It has also been very windy which is making the pollen blow into every nook and cranny both outside and inside! It can get annoying, but is something we have to put up with for a couple of weeks every year when spring arrives since we have lots of trees around. Ed was out doing yard work yesterday and came in with yellow all over him. Achooo! Hope you are enjoying spring weather where you live.
