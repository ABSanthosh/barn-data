  "text": "Ukrainian interior designer Yana Molodykh has renovated an early 20th-century apartment in Kyiv, drawing on its history to blend classical and contemporary elements. Named Landscape Alley, the apartment incorporates a blend of different styles and eras, reflecting both the heritage of the building and the background of its owners. Yana Molodykh has renovated a historic apartment in KyivThe apartment's design takes cues from the building's history and location. With its four-meter-high ceilings and classical proportions, the apartment lent itself naturally to a traditional enfilade layout, with interconnected rooms arranged into a neat row. Its classic framework allowed for experimentation with an eclectic mix of styles, incorporating elements from a range of eras including Belle Époque and art deco. The kitchen can be hidden behind panels painted to match the walls\"The classical architecture served as a perfect backdrop for experimenting with different styles, unifying the mix into a cohesive and organic space,\" Molodykh told Dezeen. \"Playfulness and a shared sense of adventure with the client helped us create a balanced harmony within the space. By embracing the process without fear of making mistakes or taking ourselves too seriously, we allowed each element to tell its own personal story.\" Tall doors, parquet floors and plaster mouldings throughout interior pay homage to the building's heritage. The main bedroom has a bespoke bed with a poplar veneer headboardA walnut-clad arch serves as a focal point in the open-plan living and dining area, framing a nook and visually connecting the space to the kitchen, which features walnut veneer cabinetry and a quartzite countertop and backsplash. Designed as an extension of the living room, the kitchen is tucked behind floating panels painted to match the walls. The arch motif is echoed in shelving hidden on either side of the central walnut-clad arch. A vintage Murano glass chandelier by Venetian brand Venini anchors the living and dining room. The dressing room features wallpaper with a fan patternIn the main bedroom, a bespoke bed with a poplar veneer headboard is flanked by two marble side tables. The adjoining dressing room is embellished with fan-patterned wallpaper and wardrobe handles shaped like brass frogs. The second bedroom features mouldings modelled on decorative details that Molodykh uncovered behind a drywall ceiling during a previous renovation project. Here, the cherry-veneer bed doubles as a sofa, providing flexibility within the compact space. A custom marble vanity and shower niches by local furniture brand Llab Design were paired with black and white mosaic flooring in the bathroom, while the cabinetry and fixtures provide brass accents. Throughout the apartment, artwork was chosen to reflect the client's Ukrainian roots. Works by Maria Prymachenko, Marfa Tymchenko and other Ukrainian artists infuse the space with a sense of nostalgia. Molodykh added decorative moulding in the second bedroom\"The client's childhood, spent in a small town in central Ukraine, heavily influenced the selection of art for the apartment,\" Molodykh said. \"The art wasn't chosen to match the interior. Instead, each piece was selected because it made our hearts beat faster,\" she added. \"While planning the installation, we found that the paintings seemed to choose their own spots within the apartment, challenging our original layout plans.\" The cherry-veneer bed doubles as a sofaThe walls were painted in a warm white throughout the apartment to provide a neutral backdrop for the bold artwork and the rich material palette of the furniture. \"The warm white Argile Blanche on the walls acts as a blank canvas, while bold strokes of colour, texture and material bring the space to life,\" she said. \"The materials were chosen with a focus on natural elements, practicality and uniqueness.\" The apartment has a small balconySince founding her studio in 2011, Molodykh has completed a number of projects across Ukraine including a refurbished attic apartment in Kyiv.
