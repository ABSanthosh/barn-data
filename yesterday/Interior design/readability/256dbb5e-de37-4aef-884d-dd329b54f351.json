  "text": "DecoratingDecor \u0026 AccessoriesWe independently select these products—if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.If you tallied up the collective amount of time I spend on Facebook Marketplace every week, I might just delete the Facebook app entirely out of embarrassment. I love keeping tabs on interesting, semi-affordable secondhand home items for sale near me (if anyone in New York has leads on a good vintage full-length mirror, please LMK). But the more I browse, the more I realize there’s another reason I get so much FB Marketplace enjoyment: free decorating inspiration.I have a “secret” trick where I check out my Marketplace feed not only for products to buy, but also home design ideas. Because sellers usually take environmental photos of furniture and decor pieces styled out, these images essentially double as a $0 way to see how real people have decorated their spaces (but in an admiring, non-invasive kind of way, of course). I live in a pre-war brownstone, so it’s interesting to catch glimpses of other bedrooms or living rooms with similar layouts and architectural details, too. Best of all, this process gives me attainable, approachable visuals, versus scrolling through perfectly-curated Pinterest or Instagram interior shots.Here’s what I mean: Just this week, I saw an IKEA desk for sale on Facebook Marketplace with a pretty Schumacher fabric skirt applied to the bottom. Do I need a new desk? No, but I clicked on the listing because I wanted a closer look at the upholstered chair, wall art, and table lamp surrounding the desk in the cover image — all of which aligned with my design style. I then saved the posting (although I’ll often also take a screenshot) to reference whenever I need shopping or styling inspiration.I’ve even messaged people asking about items in the background of their listing photos that aren’t for sale at all, and others have done the same to me. Last year, someone local posted a vintage leather ottoman (again, something I don’t need for my own apartment but felt compelled to click on), and I spotted a gorgeous spindled console table next to it in one of the pictures. I contacted the seller, and she told me she’d originally bought the piece on Facebook Marketplace and didn’t know the brand but gave me key words to search for a similar style. If I don’t feel like bugging a Facebook user over a home item they’re not selling — because I can understand some people (rightfully) might find that extremely annoying — I’ll upload a screenshot to Google Lens for a similar product match, especially if an object I’ve spotted looks vintage or one-of-a-kind. That way, I’m able to zoom in on the specific furniture, decor, or even window treatment I’m curious about in the image, and Google populates with shopping suggestions. It’s not always foolproof, but it does help narrow down my search.I’ve also learned from previously speaking with top Facebook Marketplace seller Alisa Bovino that saving product listings I like but might not necessarily need will train the algorithm to better understand my style preferences to personalize my feed. So, even if you’re not shopping for your space at all, just log on to Facebook the next time you need a (free!) little burst of interior design inspiration. Who knows — you might see a real-life gallery wall placement you’ve never thought of, or discover a new paint color for your next home project.",
