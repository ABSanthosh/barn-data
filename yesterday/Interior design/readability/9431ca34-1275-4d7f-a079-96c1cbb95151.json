  "description": "Here's a strange pairing of objects, from Chinese manufacturer Olight. Their Baton 4 Premium Edition is a tiny LED flashlight—less than 2.5\" long--that comes with its own charging case. Despite its tiny size, the Baton 4 has a 1,300-lumen output, and the company claims it can throw its beam 170 meters (558'). Though the press image isn't so aspirational. The charging case, which can double as a powerbank, has a built-in 5000mAh battery; the company says it can fully charge the Baton 4 up to five times, providing 190 days of runtime.The fanatical EDC crowd loves flashlights, stashing stuff inside other stuff, and charging longevity. This object seems tailor-made to scratch all three of those itches. These run $95.",
