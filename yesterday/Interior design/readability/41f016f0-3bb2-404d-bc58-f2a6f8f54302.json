Please Read Our Disclosure Policy here Source: Small Round Mirror We have a project in process right now, we’re working on a little refresh of the entry! Unfortunately we had to repaint our entry because the painters used the wrong paint formula on the trim in the renovation. It’s a long story but we are repainting all of the trim ourselves and just trying to get this done so we can get onto the fun parts. Our plan for the rest of the entry was to either wallpaper the (tiny amount) of walls or hand paint them, wallpaper the ceiling and find a fresh door color. We added the lantern a couple of years ago, removed the carpet and added wood floors and plan to add a runner at some point. (See befores and afters in this post!). I’ve intended to choose a color for the interior of our front door ever since we did the renovation, but I just wasn’t sure what color I wanted. At some point awhile back we tried a darker blue which we immediately vetoed. That was months ago, so we are so excited to finally make this entry as cute as it can be! Door paint color we chose: Del Mar Blue by Benjamin Moore I tried one more door color called Duxbury Gray by Benjamin Moore, just on a whim last week, but the tone of green turned out to be just a little too dark and drab in that spot of our entry. Sometimes with color you experiment and it works out, but other times you just don’t know what you aren’t going to love until you try it. It was a gorgeous color in our home, and my husband loved it, but just not the right mood for us especially in that darker corner of the entry. We did consider other colors for a minute, even corals and yellows (!) which would’ve also been fun, but I really just want the backdrops of our main floor to be pretty shades of creams/whites, blues and greens and then other colors are accents. We have a blue green color on our living room walls that we love, it’s Beach Glass by Benjamin Moore. In our home it’s a little bit moody and yet so welcoming and beachy. It’s really perfect for that room and our style. I considered just using it again on the door but I really wanted it to feel at least slightly different when you can see them both at the same time, perhaps lighter or darker and a wee bit more green, so the hunt was back on. Door paint color we chose: Del Mar Blue by Benjamin Moore // Lantern After another long search online I was getting overwhelmed by the options but I saw one that seemed like the right mood– a cheerful greenish blue but also moody :) called Del Mar Blue by Benjamin Moore. It looked fairly close to the color Beach Glass, but after comparing the photos and looking up the LRV (light reflective value) I determined it would be little darker and also it appeared to be more green. Of course you can never trust online colors to be exactly how they appear. You have to test them in your own light, even Beach Glass looks moodier here in real life than I’ve seen it in some homes and in the online sample. Testing paint is really the only way to know for sure (especially if you’re not really familiar with colors or how to determine which one will be right). Fingers crossed this one wouldn’t be too green or dark, we picked up a sample this weekend and got the first coat on. Much to our delight, we love it. Door paint color we chose: Del Mar Blue by Benjamin Moore Now we just have to do the final coat of paint on the door, and finish painting the trim and then we can get onto the other fun touches. We’re considering using a grasscloth wallpaper on the walls for more warmth and texture. My husband was willing to hand paint the walls with a pattern which he has done in several of our past homes, but we both love grasscloth so we might reserve his artistic talents for another space. We have so little walls to paper since most of the stair wall is paneled, so we think a textured wallpaper would be cozy. Star wallpaper (bronze, what I have above) // Star wallpaper (blue version) I had bought a couple of rolls of a star wallpaper from a designer friend over a year ago that I want to use on the tiny entry ceiling as a fun surprise when you look up. I can’t decide if we should tackle that installation ourselves or hire help, ha. It’s been years since I wallpapered a room (and I never enjoyed it hahahah), and a ceiling seems tricky. But it’s such a small space, maybe it’s worth doing ourselves. We shall see. If I hire someone to do the grasscloth (which I probably would) it would make sense to hire out to do the whole space. So, that’s what we’re working on! I’ll update you on progress. I’m always awaiting my new couch, so there’s lots happening! What projects are you working on at your house?",
