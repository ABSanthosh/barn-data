  "text": "Out of the Box by MVRDV brings a new sense of spatial experimentation to residential living in Taipei’s Tianmu neighborhood. The tower rises 25 stories, each level composed of carefully arranged box-like forms that punctuate the skyline. This composition creates a variety of outdoor terraces and balconies, expanding the possibilities for private and communal space. The marble-clad grid provides a quiet counterpoint to the dynamic geometry, grounding the building in the context of its urban surroundings. Each of the 93 apartments within the tower features a unique floor plan, so no two living spaces are quite the same. Residents find themselves engaging with layouts that respond directly to the shifting forms outside, making everyday routines more flexible. The cantilevered volumes extend living areas outwards, giving access to generous outdoor terraces that are rare in dense city environments. These terraces offer residents private moments with views over the city and distant Yangmingshan mountains. Designer: MVRDV The building’s boxy projections are not simply visual gestures; they create real, usable space both inside and out. The organization of volumes allows for cross-ventilation and natural light, making each apartment more comfortable through the seasons. The grid structure creates a sense of order and rhythm, yet the shifting boxes ensure that the building maintains a sense of playfulness and movement. This style of residential design encourages a more interactive relationship between architecture and daily life. Community amenities are integrated at ground level and in the immediate surroundings. A landscaped area with a swimming pool becomes a social anchor for residents, while nearby shops receive thoughtful updates as part of the overall project. The design is keenly aware of its context along Zhongshan North Road, responding to both the flow of people and the established architectural language of the neighborhood. This sensitivity extends to the building’s integration with the street, where the tower invites activity and engagement. Material choices reinforce the sense of minimalism and durability. The marble cladding lends a tactile quality to the exterior, while the open, airy interiors benefit from the abundance of daylight. The focus on outdoor space is especially relevant in the context of Taipei, where urban density often limits such opportunities. Here, terraces and balconies are not an afterthought but an essential component, extending the living environment and blurring the boundaries between inside and out. Out of the Box serves as an example of how high-density housing can move beyond repetition and uniformity. By rethinking the arrangement of volumes and the relationship between private and communal space, MVRDV proposes a new template for urban living. The tower’s modular approach, flexible layouts, and generous outdoor spaces offer both utility and delight.",
