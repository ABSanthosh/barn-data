My Sunday post where I share the random stuff that captured my attention or inspired me that I found online. photo: Country Living/Stacey Brandford I had the most enjoyable time this past week with family and the grandkids staying with Ed and I all week.

I plan to spend the day getting the house back in order and then relax with a good book, while in the background Ed will be watching The Masters on TV. Whatever you’re up to today, I hope it’s great!
