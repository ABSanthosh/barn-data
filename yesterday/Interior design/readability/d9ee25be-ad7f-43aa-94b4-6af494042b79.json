  "text": "Artificial orange tulips with thorns during euro 2025NIKE co-grows a new breed of orange tulips with thorns, seen across Amsterdam in the Netherlands in time for UEFA Women’s Euro 2025. Named Oranje Fatalis, the brand co-cultivated the flowers in collaboration with Dutch silk flower specialists Bloom \u0026 Wolf and the agency W+K to celebrate the competing national team’s spirit and strength of the Netherlands during the match. Tulip is an iconic symbol of the Netherlands, and for the project, the design team with NIKE imagines it to embody the look of boldness for the UEFA Women’s Euro 2025. Hence, the birth of Oranje Fatalis: oranje is the color of the national team and the country’s royal family, while the Latin word Fatalis suggests deadly or dangerous. Combined together, ‘Deadly Orange’ is a symbol for the competing national team that amidst beauty and power, there is strength and a touch of danger. Fans of the UEFA Women’s Euro 2025 can pick up their orange tulips with thorns arounf some of the florists in Amsterdam during the games.all images courtesy of NIKE, Bloom \u0026 Wolf, and W+KNIKE co-grows flowers in time for UEFA women’s gameThe orange tulips with thorns co-created with NIKE are handcrafted by the silk-flower company, Bloom \u0026 Wolf. The artificial flowers are made to look and feel as real and as close to the natural ones as possible. The campaign’s goal is to celebrate the national team, known as the Leeuwinnen (Lionesses), and together with the brand and agency W+K, the silk-flower company designs and handmakes parades of orange tulips for the UEFA Women’s Euro 2024.The Oranje Fatalis is part of a larger campaign across the Netherlands, and some of the players featured in the campaign include Esme Brugts, Jill Roord, Jackie Groenen, Romée Leuchter, and Wieke Kaptein. Their photos appear next to the orange thorned tulip in posters and videos, visibly using the signature font of NIKE to signal the collaboration. Florists across Amsterdam have these orange tulips with thorns for a period of time, and fans of the UEFA Women’s Euro 2025 can swing by them between July 5th and 13th before watching the match.the orange tulips with thorns across Amsterdam during Euro 2025NIKE co-cultivates the artificial orange tulips in time for Euro 2025the name of the orange tulips shown during Euro 2025 is Oranje Fatalisthe petals of the flowers are made of silkdetailed view of the orange tulips during Euro 2025",
