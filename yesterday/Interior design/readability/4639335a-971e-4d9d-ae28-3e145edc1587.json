  "text": "How about a fancy cabin bag that appears to be moving when you are standing for your boarding pass or awaiting your boarding call in the lounge? All sorts of suitcases make an appearance these days. Some are modular, some reminiscent of the icons, and some throw in an optical illusion to put fun to your airport look and those timeless halts. And for the latter, we are sold! Designed and developed by Germany-based RIMOWA using high-end anodized aluminum, the suitcase is a fancy variant of the company’s original carry-on. Aptly dubbed Original Cabin Optical, this suitcase in RIMOWA’s words “redefines boundaries.” This is done by “creating” an “illusion of the iconic groves disappearing.” Designer: RIMOWA In simpler words, the famous RIMOWA suitcase is made with a shimmering effect achieved by a brushing technique that gives the suitcase the illusion of movement. The Cabin Optical’s anodized aluminum exterior has an alternating brushed finish to create this illusion: so, when you are at the airport or in the hotel lobby, people could mistake your suitcase to be moving even when it’s standing beside you. Such illusion happens because of these specially brushed groves that with the change in light and perspective create the illusion of movement. This interesting optical motif is not only limited to the exterior, interestingly RIMOWA carries it to the inside of its limited-edition Cabin Optical. Here the jacquard lining is directly woven with geometric patterns for a similar effect. The Cabin Optical is available in 35 litter carry-on sized dimensions making it – according to the company – apt for three to four days of travel. The suitcase itself is pretty lightweight, weighing only 9.5lbs, and comes with a stage-free telescoping handle, RIMOWA’s Multiwheel system with cushioned axles, and Flex Divider. It is strictly limited-edition of just 2,002 examples. The number is only chosen for its palindromic nature and has no relevance to the year, which I earlier thought to be the case.  Currently available for pre-order, with sales beginning November 7, the special silver Cabin Optical will set you back $2,050. If you are not ready to shell that kind of money, you can pick the suitcase in your choice of silver, emerald green, black and titanium for $1,430.",
