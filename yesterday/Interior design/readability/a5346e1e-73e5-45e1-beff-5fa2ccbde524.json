  "text": "Archigram 10: Circa Press publishes pioneering group’s latest issueArchigram 10 is the latest publication from the infamous group of pioneering architectural theorists that changed architecture irrevocably in the 1960s and 70s. It arrives 50 years after the group’s last issue, Archigram 9½, released in 1974. Archigram has reformed to examine where architecture is currently and where it might go next. This new edition is set to be published by Circa Press and edited by Sir Peter Cook, with contributions from Archigram members Dennis Crompton, David Greene, and Michael Webb. Along with new work by Peter Cook, there are contributions from critics and a host of architects, young and old, whose work resonates with the Archigram ethos.Formed in London, in 1960, Archigram turned conventional architectural thinking on its head. Neo-futurist, anti-heroic, and pro-consumerist, the group tapped into the 1960s’ Pop Art zeitgeist and drew inspiration from technologies not conventionally applied to architecture. The result was a family of hypothetical objects/buildings that moved, grew, flew, and walked. It inspired generations of architects to radically rethink the confines of traditional practice and imagine a better future.all images courtesy of Circa PressArchigram 10 features Established names and younger designersContributors for the new publications are formed out of a huge variety of practitioners and teachers across multiple generations, with radically different approaches to architecture. They are united by a willingness to explore the limits of their practice, drawing on new digital influences and taking inspiration from the natural world. The writers are based around the world, including North and South America, Japan, and all over Europe. Established names such as Hitoshi Abe, Odile Decq, and Thom Mayne sit alongside younger researchers and artists who weren’t even born when the last publication came out.Architect Peter Cook, founding member of Archigram, said: ‘When ARCHIGRAM 1 was launched in 1961 (the same year as’ Private Eye’), David Greene, Mike Webb and I were hitting out at the dreariness of the architecture going up around us—not just with words but by offering up a new, explosive architecture. Nine ARCHIGRAMS later, we three plus Ron Herron, Warren Chalk, and Dennis Crompton had won competitions and influenced key architects from Tokyo, Milan, Los Angeles, and Vienna. After fifty years the same protest—and idea—seems necessary. New protagonists, ranging from my generation through to people in their twenties are in ARCHIGRAM 10. With (as always) lots of drawings…Drawings are exciting. Drawings can be very, very precise. Drawings can be wayward. Drawings can be prescient.’ Published by Circa Press with the generous support of ABB, Archigram 10 reflects a culture of technological awareness and experimentation.Archigram 10 marks the return of the visionary architectural group after 50 yearsthe latest edition explores where architecture stands today and its potential future directionsedited by Sir Peter Cook, Archigram 10 includes contributions from Archigram founders and new voicesArchigram members Dennis Crompton, David Greene, and Michael Webb revisit their revolutionary ideas",
