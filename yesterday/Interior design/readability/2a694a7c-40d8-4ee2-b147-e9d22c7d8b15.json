Meet the 2 Blade Wharncliffe Trapper – a folding knife that houses not one, but two blades. Open the one you need, use it, and fold it right back in once you’re done. Aside from the minor advantages that each blade’s individual shape provides, the only overarching benefit of such a knife is that it’s ridiculously cool and if I weren’t typing this article right now, I’d be throwing money at my screen. Trapper knives were arguably the first ‘multitools’, designed for fur trappers and hunters who needed a versatile, reliable tool for processing game in the field. Traditionally featuring two blades—a clip point and a spey blade—these knives were perfect for skinning, slicing, and general utility work. The clip-point blade offered precision for detailed cutting, while the spey blade, with its rounded tip, was ideal for skinning animals without puncturing hides. Forgesmith Jason Leclair decided to turn this age-old utility knife into a sheer work of art, blending Damascus and CuMai into what can only be described as the most beautiful pair of marbled hand-forged blades my eyes have ever seen. Designer: Jason Leclair Imagine painting the Mona Lisa twice – that’s how I like describing the sheer amount of artistry in Leclair’s knifemaking skills. The trapper boasts two blades, made from Damascus core CuMai steel. The inner Damascus layer is visible on the blade’s edge, with its gorgeous marbling pattern, but the higher you go, you see the CuMai sandwiched in the middle. The Cu or Copper makes itself visible like a lightning streak running across from bolster to tip. The shape of the copper strip as well as the Damascus steel is unique to each blade of each knife, which means there’s absolutely no way two knives look the same – every knife is unique like a fingerprint. Most trappers come with clip-point and spey-style blades, but Leclair switched things up by ditching the spey for a Wharncliffe or sheepsfoot-style blade. It definitely adds a bit of character to the knife, giving the edge an upward flair that really makes for a great silhouette. While it isn’t ideal for fur-trapping, I’d be mighty pissed if you used something as gorgeous as this to skin rabbits. It’s like using the Mona Lisa for a shower curtain. The 2 Blade Wharncliffe Trapper is nothing short of a collector’s item, although I wouldn’t be opposed to occasionally using it to maybe cut cigars or open letters, you know? The handle is arguably as gorgeous as the blades it ouses. Made from WWII vintage rag micarta, it carries the weight of time while offering durability that rivals modern synthetics. Micarta, a composite material made from layers of fabric and resin, has long been prized for its toughness, and this particular batch holds a nostalgic charm. Decades-old yet perfectly functional, it provides a grippy, comfortable surface, ensuring the knife feels just as good in hand as it looks. The bolsters, crafted from tri-color Mokume Gane, add another layer of detail. Mokume Gane, a Japanese metalworking technique that fuses different metals together in a swirling, woodgrain-like pattern, gives each bolster a unique visual identity. No two will ever look the same. Accenting the handle is a flying squirrel pattern shield, a small but deliberate detail that reinforces the knife’s individuality. Titanium liners ensure strength while keeping the weight manageable, an intentional upgrade over heavier stainless steel alternatives. The combination of materials—high-carbon steel springs, Mokume Gane bolsters, copper accents, and vintage micarta—creates an interplay of textures and colors that make the knife feel almost alive. Every material choice serves a purpose, whether functional, aesthetic, or both. While many knives lean into either artistry or utility, this one balances both effortlessly. It embraces the traditional trapper knife design, but rather than stopping at nostalgia, it evolves the concept with high-end materials and meticulous craftsmanship. A tool, a collector’s piece, and an example of expert knife-making, this dual-blade slipjoint reflects Leclair’s sheer patience and skill. The knife is up for sale and Leclair’s accepting bookings on his Instagram if you’re interested.",
