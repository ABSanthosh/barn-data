Please Read Our Disclosure Policy here This post was created in partnership with Leesa We have two guest beds in our home, one is its own small bedroom and the other two are in the Snug! I realized the other day that I haven’t posted about this cozy bed nook under the eaves since we put the bed over here. So today I have new Snug Bed Nook photos to share! I will also give you an update on our new Leesa mattress. You’ll want to check out Leesa’s President’s Day sale which runs through February 24th. They have 30% off select mattresses plus a free sleep bundle with purchase (2 free pillows and microfiber sheet set which is a $299 value!) You can visit Leesa.com and use my code MELISSA50 for an additional $50 off any mattress on top of the sale price. Our family loves staying in the Snug when they come to visit so it’s been wonderful to have a cozy bed here. It’s often in use! A few months ago we got a new Leesa mattress for this nook and I’m happy to report everyone loves it! It’s so comfortable–a perfect spot for a nap, snuggling with a baby, or staying overnight! I want our home to be a safe and comfortable retreat for our family, so having quality mattresses for everyone to sleep on matters to me. We got the Leesa Legend Hybrid mattress for the Snug– it’s a luxury mattress at an affordable price! With babies snuggling here, I appreciate that it’s GreenGuard Gold certified to be free of harmful chemicals. One of the things I imagined the minute we walked in this house for the first time was how perfect this room would be for a bed nook or two! The angled ceilings (and our new comfy Leesa mattress) make everyone feel as snug as a bug. Last year we took out carpet and added the hardwoods when we did the renovation downstairs. I think the new flooring made this bed nook feel even more charming and definitely cleaner with pups. We’re really happy we did the floors during the renovation so the messiest part is out of the way. Now we can focus on other projects in here! I’m really looking forward painting the walls in here someday, or maybe even wallpaper. I’ve been saving a lot of cute cottage style attic rooms for inspiration. My childhood bedroom had angled walls like this and our first house did too. That’s probably why I really feel at home in this room. Dreaming big, maybe some day we’ll have built in bunks! Ahhh! We’re happy using furniture we have for now, but it’s still fun to dream of possibilities and ways to make the Snug even cozier. One simple thing I’ve been wanting to add to the bed nook is wall sconces for above the bed since we don’t have room for lamps. In the meantime we just use a clip on reading light for guests and that works just fine for now. We’re having fun making this our forever home, one corner (and one cozy bed nook!) at a time. Don’t forget to check out Leesa’s President’s Day Sale and use my code MELISSA50 for an extra $50 off any Leesa mattress. You can shop all of my recommendations through my LTK (you don’t need the app to shop, but if you follow me there you will get notified when I post and this makes it easier for you to find my recommendations, too). Do you have a cozy nook for a bed?",
