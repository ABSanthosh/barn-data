  "description": "While hammering nails isn't difficult for those of us with average dexterity, it can be tricky for others. And junky though these nail-holding pliers look, they actually hew to form-follows-function admirably.The two cylinders on the butt end of the handle, along with the flat back of the jaws, allow the user to hold the tool flat against the wall while still leaving clearance for fingers. It can grasp multiple gauges of nail, and offers two different starting depths, better accommodating those with grip issues or clumsiness.I love the engraving on the hammer.I've never heard of the company that makes these, Jelanry, and their copy is hilarious:\"Usage scenario guide: Christmas tree or Christmas decorations, shower curtain or curtains installation.\" I'd love to see the Christmas tree at the copywriter's house.",
