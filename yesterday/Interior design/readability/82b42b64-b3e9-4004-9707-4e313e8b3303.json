  "description": "How to build a shelf to hide the washer and dryer components.  This easy DIY shelf will hide the ugly washer and dryer components, but also gives you plenty of additional storage for laundry needs.  This is the second time I've added a DIY shelf unit behind our top loader washer and dryer -- I love them!   This shelf project was one of MANY in our mud room/laundry combo makeover. I tackled so many DIYs, from customizing a set of base cabinets to tiling the backsplash and finally adding beautiful floral wallpaper.  This washer and dryer shelf was something I was really missing in our current laundry area. As a reminder, this is what we had when we moved in:  Not bad at all! But the cabinets were hung at a height that were better suited for front loaders -- there was no room underneath to put a shelf, but it was difficult to reach over the washer and dryer and access the cabinets.  **I get a lot of questions about that tray under the washer -- it catches small leaks. It was cracked so we ended up removing it. (I now use a Govee water sensor next to the washer.) Part of my big plan for this space was to move those cabinets over to another wall in here, with drawer cabinets underneath. This was a great decision, it made the flow of the room work so much better.  That created space for the shelf above the washer and dryer.

I started by figuring out the middle spot between the two machines. I hung a piece of scrap wood and drilled it into studs:  This acts as a support for the bottom shelf -- I like to add a little extra security wherever I can!  Then I placed some supports at the sides as well -- I used these to secure my vertical boards (nailed into the side of the supports) as I was building:  (Ignore that white scrap on the right, it was just leaning there.) The inside boards were purely for support at the beginning, but I'm keeping them there so the vertical pieces won't move around. You can't really see these when you're done.  You can also build this shelf elsewhere and then bring it in and install. I prefer to build it in place so there are no issues with fit and size.  I suggest cutting away your baseboards so the side supports can go flush against the wall. The wood was 3/4 inch, so I cut the baseboards accordingly:  This makes everything more secure and looks more custom. I use this small oscillating saw and it works great!  The bottom shelf was next -- I attached it to the long horizontal support (the first piece I installed) and the side supports. I nailed it with my nail gun first:  And then secured it from underneath using screws. (I used a Kreg jig to make pocket holes underneath.) You can also use wood glue and then screw into the sides to support that shelf. Just be sure to use a drill bit to make a hole for the screw to go into first -- this will help prevent the wood from splitting. You'll also want to make sure you can cover the head of any screws with putty or trim.  The top piece went on last and I mitered the ends so you don't see any rough edges on the side or top of the shelves:  The whole thing was super secure, except for in the middle of the top shelf.  It was bowing a bit with heavier items, so I added a support in the middle that created two sections:  I used common pine for this project -- the cheapest I could find! I was planning to paint instead of staining.  I knew stain would look great, but I would've wanted it to match the counters we put in here. I didn't want to mess with trying to find a stain match.  The mud room bench unit right next to it is a bright white, so I went with that:  I caulked everything, then gave it a few coats of semi-gloss white paint. I ended up adding a simple MDF trim to the front to cover the irregular edges of the wood boards, but it's not needed!     It turned out SO great! It's perfect!:  I'll share links to all the items on the shelves below.  I love having everything we need out and easy to access, but also looking really cute. ;) I lucked out and found those cute baskets that fit perfectly on the bottom shelf. I just love it!:  And here's how it looked after the wallpaper was added to this wall:  Here's where we started:  And how it looks after the whole makeover: You can see every step of this laundry room makeover here. This is one of the pretties rooms in our house and I LOVE IT.  The shelf instead of cabinets (we couldn't reach) functions so much better for us! I also love how this unit hides the ugly stuff behind the washer and dryer.   Here are sources for the items pictured:  Runner is from At Home Share this",
