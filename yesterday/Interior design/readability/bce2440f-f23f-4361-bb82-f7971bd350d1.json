Currently, I live in my maximalist dream home in New Orleans, Louisiana, with my partner, a perfect dog, and a cute cat.published about 8 hours agoWe independently select these products—if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.IKEA continues to be a popular home furnishings source for the folks whose homes we tour here at Apartment Therapy. Whether you rent or own, there’s almost always something from IKEA’s varied catalog of furniture, lighting, accessories, decor, and more that can complement your home’s style.Over the last 11 (!) years that I’ve worked at Apartment Therapy, I’ve seen all sorts of popular IKEA products used over and over again in homes, ranging from big traditionally decorated spaces to teeny, minimal, and modern ones.And while it’s no surprise that I see IKEA heavy hitters like their BILLY bookshelves over and over again in house tours (they are so hackable, after all, like in this Los Angeles home or this UK home), I was surprised by one small product I saw quite a few times in homes of all types of styles.Laura Seed bought this apartment for herself and her two rescue cats and has been working on filling it with an array of fun, eclectic items, just like IKEA's VARMBLIXT.IKEA’s VARMBLIXT LED light, which actually came out in 2023, became — by all available evidence I saw in house tours this year — as the light fixture to have in your home in 2024. Available in one color, a bold and modern orange hue, I guess I was surprised that so many people were drawn to its ultra-contemporary minimal look.But I shouldn’t have been caught off guard by the popularity of this fixture; it’s affordable ($69.99), gives off a delightfully warm amount of light, and perhaps best of all, can be used on a tabletop OR the wall. Who doesn’t love versatility? AT’s own Blair Donovan named it the new “It” lighting trend all the way back in 2023. It’s such a great product, it was actually named best Double-Duty lighting in this year’s Small/Cool Design Awards! And it turns out this small but mighty orange glass light fixture is even hackable itself: Someone turned IKEA’S VERMBLIXT into an everything bagel (and it’s as amazing as it sounds!).",
