But I’ve also experienced living with several people and manoeuvring around everyone during meal times can be a challenge. There are a lot of people who share their living spaces with other people but most kitchen appliances are meant to be used by one person at a time. When you’re living with other people, that’s not always the realistic scenario. Designer: Anil Ramesh This concept developed for Electrolux is designed for such a situation. The Peninsular free-standing cooking range can be accessed from 3 sides so that a couple of people can prepare and cook their food simultaneously. The range can be operated by 1 or more users since it has a rotatable inferface for the oven and the hob. The sliding over door opens to the left but it can also be opened from the front. The cooking range also has other features to help not just with the cooking but also the preparation and even the eventual service once you’re done cooking. There are borders that can protect you and also to attach accessories to store cutting boards and other kitchen utensils. There are also rotatable drawers that can be accessed from the front and the right side. There is also an upper storage shelf so you can put your spices and other ingredients. It even has an LED lamp for when you need some extra light. There’s also an option to have a modular hood. It’s a pretty nifty thing to have in your kitchen, especially if you’re sharing it with family members or roomates.",
