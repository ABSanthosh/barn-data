  "description": "Here's something all of us could've used at ID school: This Sherman Backpack, by industrial designer Fernando A. Robert (a/k/a StudioFAR) was designed to carry odd-shaped objects. Our drawing boards, acrylic sheets, portfolios, blueprint tubes etc. would've fit perfectly in here. (I'm dating myself with those last two references.) The bag was designed for client Chrome. The Sherman backpack is a one-of-a-kind, utilitarian bike bag. Made to haul anything from a spare set of wheels, to a bike frame, to an artist's portfolio, and all the spare tools and equipment you need, the Sherman is unique and highly functional. Its unique tri-fold design gives you all the room to pack your gear, clothes, an extra wheel set, even an extra frame along with you. Chrome's Sherman pack is a real tool bag.Pedaling to a race or event has never been easier with Chrome's Sherman Pro Race Bag. Its unique tri-fold design gives you all the room to pack your gear, clothes, an extra wheelset, even an extra frame along with you. Sketch, CAD, refine.Taking in the brief, we provided Chrome with various options for this utilitarian backpack. The design needed to be flexible but also provide secure tie downs for bike wheels, riding tools, but also various sizes packages. You can see more of Robert's work here.",
