  "description": "If you do an online search for ashtrays, you'll be shocked at how many offerings are on the market. If you're American, you'll likely find this strange; only 11% of us smoke cigarettes. In the rest of the world, however, smoking rates remain startlingly high. A company called Provape combed through data from the World Health Organization to see which European countries have the highest rates of smoking: In first place is Belgium, with an estimated cigarette smoking prevalence of 33.9%. Belgium has implemented multiple anti-smoking measures, such as plain packaging for cigarettes, high tobacco taxes, and public smoking bans. Sweden takes second place, with an estimated cigarette smoking prevalence of 33.8%. Cigarette packages in Sweden must carry health warnings and advertising has strict regulations in a bid to reduce smoking. Third place is claimed by Austria, with an estimated cigarette smoking prevalence of 31.3%. Smoking remains a large public health issue in Austria, with significant rates of tobacco-related diseases.Bulgaria is in fourth place, with an estimated cigarette smoking prevalence of 29.8%. Bulgaria is home to several large tobacco companies which have complicated efforts for a reduction in smoking. However, tobacco taxes have been implemented to reduce the proportion of adults who smoke. Taking fifth place is Finland, with an estimated cigarette smoking prevalence of 29.3%. Smoking has been banned in all enclosed public spaces,and Finland has high taxes on tobacco products. Denmark is in sixth place, with an estimated cigarette smoking prevalence of 28.8%. Denmark aims to be a tobacco-free country by 2030, with a goal of fewer than 5% of the population smoking tobacco products. To do this, they have invested in numerous public health campaigns, raising awareness about the dangers of smoking. In seventh place is Iceland, with an estimated cigarette smoking prevalence of 28.7%. Iceland's national Quitline service offers free advice and guidance for smokers trying to quit, and the country also offers smoking cessation programs that offer counselling and prescription medications. Italy takes eighth place, with an estimated cigarette smoking prevalence of 28.5%. Italy has banned all tobacco adverts on TV, radio, and print media, as well as implementing high taxes on all tobacco products to reduce smoking. Ninth place is claimed by Georgia, with an estimated cigarette smoking prevalence of 28.2%. With a long history of tobacco farming, efforts to reduce smoking in Georgia face challenges due to economic interests.Russia is in tenth place, with an estimated cigarette smoking prevalence of 24.8%. Smoking is heavily ingrained into Russian culture, but the government has launched campaigns to raise awareness about the dangers of smoking. Cigarettes are also required to have graphic health warnings on their packaging as a deterrent. Fairly shocking. Scandinavian countries routinely rank as the happiest in the world, and they dominate the top ten. The figures aren't much better in Asia. Japan is at 30.8%, China at 45.6%. South Korea is at 22.6%, but with a weird gender split: 39.7% of men smoke, but just 5.2% of women. You might think America is doing pretty good at just 11%. But the UK has us beat, at just 5.1%. The three countries with the lowest smoking rates are all in Africa: Ghana at 3.7%, Ethiopia at 4.6% and Nigeria at 4.8%.",
