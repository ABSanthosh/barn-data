All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Photo: Dustin Peck; Design: Anne Pearson DesignMinimalist and Scandi-inspired aesthetics may have dominated interior design in the 2000s and 2010s, but maximalism is undeniably the movement of the 2020s. From bold colors and fun patterns to eclectic combos, maximalism embraces vibrant, deeply personalized, and dynamic design — and experts agree this style isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. As a part of Apartment Therapy’s fifth annual The State of Home Design Survey, 154 designers were polled on the biggest home trend predictions for 2025, from popular design styles to trending color palettes. Among their top forecasts, many designers noted patterns will also be huge this year; in particular, they believe pattern clashing will dominate interiors of all styles. In response to the survey question, “What’s one design trend you hope will stick around for 2025, and why?” the words “patterns,” “pattern play,” and “pattern mixing” were mentioned repeatedly. Kevin Billings, principal and lead designer at Dexter \u0026 Plaid in Northern Virginia, sums up the general sentiment: “I think spaces with a mix and blend of patterns (and textures) just make for such an interesting and inviting environment,” he says.Credit: Photo: Hannah Forsberg; Design: Heuer Design CollectivePattern clashing, or power pattern mixing, isn’t as simple as throwing two or more patterns together and hoping for the best, though. To do it intentionally (and make it look professional), the pros always follow a few rules.First, Gretchen Rivera, owner and principal designer of Casa Casual Interiors, says to choose patterns in different sizes to create balance in your space. “Think: one big, bold pattern, several medium ones, and some mini prints or subtle textures,” she says. The goal is to choose a main focal point design that pairs well with smaller-scale prints, like a large floral motif styled in the same space as medium-sized stripes and mini geometric designs, for example. Credit: Photo: Heather Ison; Design: Indigo Pruitt Design StudioSecond, and perhaps most importantly, use a common color (or colors) to unify all the patterns in your space, adds Rivera. This doesn’t mean every pattern you choose has to have the exact same colors in it, but you should stick closely to a cohesive palette. Colleen Bennett, principal designer and founder of CBB Design Firm, says a room’s lighting can also affect how well pattern clashing works. In spaces with plenty of natural light, multiple patterns can be layered easily because the brightness prevents them from feeling overwhelming or blending in to each other. In contrast, darker spaces or rooms with plenty of bold colors can quickly feel overwhelmed by too many patterns. “The focus shifts to simplicity,” she explains. “Use fewer patterns and incorporate bright white elements to balance the intensity of colors to prevent the space from feeling too busy.”Credit: Photo: Meghann Padgett; Design: Paige DesignsAs for specific types of patterns to try, the designers Apartment Therapy surveyed expect arboreal motifs — like woodland-inspired trees and forest scenes — to be huge this year. Nashville-based designer Evan Millárd also hopes to see “floral patterns that are reminiscent of my grandmother’s home” having a continuation in 2025. Charleston-based designer Paige Dick is advocating for more checkerboard designs — especially when it comes to pattern mixing. “They bring out the best in other materials and are effortlessly chic,” she adds.If this is your first time trying pattern clashing, don’t be afraid to play around with sizes and colors to ensure everything fits together. It will likely take some experimentation to get it right, but that’s half the fun anyway!",
