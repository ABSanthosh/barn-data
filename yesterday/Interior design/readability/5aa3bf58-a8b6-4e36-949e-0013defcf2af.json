  "description": "Based on MIT research, a company called Bright developed Beacon40, a light technology that \"could significantly reduce toxic beta-amyloid levels in the brain, a major factor in cognitive decline.\" To turn this into a product aimed at those struggling with Alzheimer's, Bright turned to ID consultancy Y Studios.BEACON40® therapy light is designed to promote brain health for people living with Alzheimer's disease symptoms. Beacon40's technology is based on neural research that shows lights pulsing at a gamma frequency of 40Hz (40 times per second) increases microglia responses in the brain to purge the amyloid beta plaque associated with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Complementing scientifically proven methods to dramatically reduce the risk of cognitive decline including regular exercise, healthy diet and quality sleep, Beacon40 can also be used by people looking to prevent cognitive decline. Design ConsiderationsAvailable as a standalone personal light or a surround system to fill a room, the industrial design of the Beacon40 is imbued with a quiet elegance that blends beautifully into any home or office. The design was purposely created to present the innovative wellness technology with an extremely approachable experience. Complimenting soft \"pillow-like\" surfacing with geometric forms crafted an inviting appearance for the BEACON40®. The fabric diffuser was selected to retain the warmth of the home environment while the base cradles the premium interface, angled for sitting or standing operation. We paid very close attention to the ergonomics and UX design by making it easy to turn the lights on/off, set daily timers and adjust the tone and brightness. We had to consider that a typical user may have some level of cognitive decline and the app integration would not be desirable for everyone. This guided us to having full physical controls on the base as a necessity. The tactile interface delivers an uncomplicated success, clearly providing feedback for each setting in separate, easily understood controls. The system can also be voiced controlled via Amazon Alexa, Google Home or Apple Home to set daily routines. You can see more of Y Studios' work here.",
