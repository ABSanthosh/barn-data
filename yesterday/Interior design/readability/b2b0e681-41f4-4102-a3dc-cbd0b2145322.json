  "description": "Canadian inventor Mitch Krahn suffers from a herniated disc. He finds that leaning far back in his chair helps to alleviate the pain, but finds it difficult to work from that position. He thus conceived of this Ergo Desk, a sitting and standing desk that can also recline, in the manner of a drafting table. It occurs to me that such a desk might appeal to the ID'er who sketches often. Nothing beats the ergonomics of drawing on an inclined surface, which provides full freedom of shoulder motion; I always found that having to rest your elbow on a flat surface really restricts your movements, forcing you to overcompensate with your wrists.I'm curious to see what the actual tilt mechanism is, assuming Krahn's got it worked out; he doesn't show it. And I think he might want to add a second stay-flat portion of the desk on the left side, to accommodate lefties who don't want their mouse/mousepad/coffee cup clattering to the floor. It would also help for those of us who have desktop speakers flanking our monitors. Krahn's plan is to launch the desk on Kickstarter next month.",
