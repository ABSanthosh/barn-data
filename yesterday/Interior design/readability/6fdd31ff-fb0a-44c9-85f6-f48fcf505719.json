All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.I’m constantly on the lookout for cool vintage finds at my local thrift store, antique mall, and flea market — and glass fairy lamps are one item I’ve seen everywhere lately. Here’s everything you need to know about this versatile, small-space-friendly vintage trend, plus where to find them. What Are Glass Fairy Lamps? Fairy lamps actually don’t require electricity at all. Created in the mid-19th century, they’re glass vessels — typically covered — designed to hold a small candle and provide a safer, longer-lasting alternative to freestanding tapers or votives when lit. These candle-powered light sources have come in and out of style throughout the following decades, including in the 1960s and ’70s, during which they served as unique mid-century modern accents and colorful candleholders. They’re also not to be confused with fairy lights, aka the delicate string lights that are increasingly popular today.My aunt, who constantly scours local estate sales in Northern California, gave me a clear glass fairy lamp in a vintage stars-and-bars pattern last year, and it’s now one of my favorite home decor accents. The great thing about fairy lights is they can be styled in a variety of ways. Mine started as a tissue holder in my bedroom, then I placed some faux floral stems in the center opening to create a spring centerpiece, and now it sits on top of my shoe cabinet with a battery-operated puck light that I use as a night-light. Where to Buy Vintage Fairy LampsFor me, the hunt for good vintage finds is part of the thrill of it all. So if you’re looking for a fairy lamp of your own, frequenting thrift stores, antique malls, flea markets, and estate sales is always a good idea. However, many vintage fairy lamps have already been found and are readily available online via sites like eBay, Etsy, and occasionally Facebook Marketplace. The Best Vintage Fairy Lamps for SaleShopping online for vintage fairy lamps might take some of the treasure hunt out of it all, but it’s also where you can find the best variety and some rare styles, too. Since I’m now fully obsessed with this trendy vintage decor, I have a growing wish list of glass fairy lamps, and I’m sharing a few of my favorites (add them to your cart before I do!).",
