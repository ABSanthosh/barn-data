  "text": "DecoratingDecor \u0026 AccessoriesWe independently select these products—if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Maybe you decorate the same way for the holidays every year and have your go-to pieces and color palette. Or maybe you like to keep it fresh and are searching for some new inspiration for your tree, mantel, and more this year. If you fall into the latter category, it seems like this holiday season is going to be one ruled by nostalgic and vintage touches. Particularly there seems to be a longing for your grandparents’ house and their festive mid-century decor (think: bubble lights, tinsel, and a Space Age-inspired palette of all metallic everything) — at least if a recent survey from Redecor is any indicator. According to the gaming app’s findings, which predict holiday trends, vintage decor is returning in a big way. In fact, 56% of participants said they’re planning to incorporate more vintage elements into their homes this holiday season. Specifically, the survey cited the comeback of metallic Christmas trees and ornaments — 22% of respondents said they were seeking out these shiny, reflective accents. These types of pieces might make you think of aluminum Christmas trees, which first gained popularity in the 1960s and tended to be silver but also came in different metallic colored finishes. Glitzy trees were also popular in the ’80s, when glam styles peaked again.There’s something so chic about a silver or gold metallic Christmas tree. You can also add color into the metallic trend as an accent; these shiny shades pair well with just about anything. Once you bring in shimmering tones and reflective finishes, simple decor won’t stand a chance. That’s because metallics can even brighten up dim spaces and draw attention to whatever holiday decor you’re trying to play up.The survey also revealed that about half (47%) decorate for Christmas the day after Thanksgiving, but another nearly 20% have their decorations up before the November holiday. Some even start in September! Whether you’re an early decorator or someone who waits until the last minute, adding these fresh trends to your holiday setup will spark some fun and add a little more variety to the red and green fare many are used to. This holiday season, why not bring a little extra sparkle into your home? I know I will be looking out for metallic decorations to add some shine to my space. After all, it’s proof that mid-century modern design’s influence (and the influence of the ’80s) is alive!",
