  "text": "sensing instrument reinterprets traditional systemsStudio Heech’s modular partition system reinterprets the traditional Korean wattle and daub method for contemporary interiors. At the exhibition ‘Room, As It Is’ at Arumjigi in Seoul, Sensing Instrument explores the potential of earth as a sustainable material that does not generate industrial waste in modern architecture. While looking at how natural materials can become part of one’s daily routine, the structure ensures that it maintains the flexibility and functionality demanded by modern environments.A 3D printed washbasin and folding bench is installed within, forming contrasts with the raw textures of the earth, clay, bamboo, and straw made with the assistance of skilled craftsmen. Employing these materials and construction methods, the studio challenges the misconception that traditional materials are unsuitable for contemporary lifestyles.all images by Doyeon Kwon unless stated otherwisestudio heech explores potential of earth in modern interiorsAmidst spaces typically defined by industrialized materials, Studio Heech’s Sensing Instrument introduces natural elements through sight, smell, and touch. The exhibition setting further enhances this design narrative, with the Arumjigi building offering panoramic views of the historic Gyeongbokgung Palace on one side and a traditional Korean courtyard, or Hanok, on the other. The Seoul-based studio’s design draws inspiration from the concept of ‘borrowing the landscape’ from outside into interior spaces, which is central to traditional Korean architecture.Sensing Instrument is a spatial device that allows users to subtly tailor their experience of the space, blending natural elements with modern adaptability. Meanwhile, the panoramic view borrowed from the outside is experienced differently depending on the changes in the space controlled by the occupants. In addition, the earthy scent and texture evoked by the traditional wattle and daub walls contribute to a layered, intricate, and personalized spatial experience.Studio Heech presents Sensing Instrumentthe system maintains the flexibility and functionality demanded by modern environmentsthe wall is made with the assistance of skilled craftsmen",
