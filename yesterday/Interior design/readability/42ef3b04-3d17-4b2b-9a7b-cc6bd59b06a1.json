This can be tricky to maintain when we’re so used to just tossing things aside as soon as we step indoors. So, in order to keep that warm and comfortable air in our homes’ entrance, what should we avoid keeping in plain view? Here are a few of those items. Too Many Coats and Jackets While it’s definitely practical to leave your coats and jackets in the entryway, an overstuffed coat rack creates a chaotic energy right inside your door, turning what should be simple storage into something far too cluttered. Instead, consider storing jackets inside a closet, cabinet, or even in a dedicated entryway hutch if you have the space for it. If you must hang something freely in the entryway, choose just one or two go-to pieces. Keeping things minimal helps avoid the overwhelm of a space that’s supposed to feel refreshing and inviting. Photo Credit: Canva Pro Piles of Mail Mail often ends up being left in the entryway as we need to put it down when we come in, but these piles of papers, many of which are destined for the recycling bin anyway, just creates a messy look. A stack of unopened envelopes doesn’t exactly scream “welcome home.” Instead of letting mail sit around, have a dedicated tray, drawer, or bowl that stores it all and helps keep it localized, thus easy to find or sort through. It’s best if this tray is further into the home so you don’t just set it and forget it as soon as you walk in. Photo Credit: Canva Pro Shoes You Don’t Wear Often Many people keep every pair of shoes they own in the entryway, but not all footwear needs to be right by the door all the time. Shoes you don’t wear regularly just take up space and make for more of a mess. Consider rotating shoes based on seasonality or current style, storing others in a closet in the meantime. A shoe bench, rack, or other organizer can help if you want to keep them all close by, but be sure to only keep the pairs you wear often near the door. Photo Credit: Canva Pro Expired or Unused Cleaning Supplies Cleaning supplies should be accessible, yes, but keeping them in full view in your entryway generally isn’t the best. The entryway is a public-facing space, and having things like half-empty bottles of cleaner laying around feels disorganized. If you prefer have cleaning supplies near the door for quick access, try a more discreet storage container that blends in and doesn’t feel jarring in the space, preferably somewhere low like under a console table so it’s generally out of sight. Photo Credit: Canva Pro Sports Equipment or Toys While the entryway might feel like an easy place to drop off sports equipment or other outdoor toys, these items can make the space feel chaotic very quickly. Items like soccer balls, bikes, or hockey sticks can create a disorganized look when they’re all dropped right inside the door. Instead, allocate a designated storage area for these items, whether it’s a closet, garage, or a side room. This way, your entryway can stays neat while the equipment and toys easily remain accessible. Photo Credit: Canva Pro Excessive Decor or Personal Items Seeing as it’s the first impression your home makes, it’s tempting to decorate the entryway with family photos, souvenirs, and knick-knacks. However, too many personal items can make the space feel cluttered Excessive decor can overwhelm your senses as soon as you walk through the door, which defeats the purpose of a welcoming space. Choose one or two pieces that reflect your personality but don’t command the space. There will be plenty of room for decorating elsewhere, keep your entrance simple. Photo Credit: Canva Pro Think of your entryway as the first impression your guests will have of your home. You wouldn’t want them to walk into a cluttered, disorganized mess, right? Not only that, but keeping these things out of your entryway will help you feel more organized, too. A few mindful changes in what you keep there is all you need to transform this small area into one that’s both stylish and functional.
