You might even have a weekly washing machine rotation, but it’s important to know how often to wash a mattress protector to carve out some time for this bedroom essential, too.As you might already know, the best mattress protectors are a welcome addition to any bedroom. Some are cooling, others are waterproof, and some can even keep dust mites and bed bugs at bay. But it’s safe to say that mattress protectors need a little maintenance if you want to make the most of these perks. And while knowing how to wash a mattress protector is vital, this task loses all of its value if you don’t do it as often as you should.So, how often should you wash a mattress protector? We asked the experts for their advice, and you probably aren't washing it as often as you should - especially if you have pets in the house or like to drink water at night.(Image credit: Future/Darren Chung)The beauty of a mattress protector is evident from the name. And as the experts at Simba tell us, ‘Mattress protectors prevent any damage to the top of the mattress.’ Of course, this can drastically improve how long a mattress lasts - but only if you look after the mattress protector.Emma Rowlinson, Product Development Manager at bedding company Christy, explains that it's important to take care of your mattress protector if you want it to last as long as possible. She also revealed that the average lifespan of a mattress protector is around two years if you look after it well.And part of that is cleaning the protector on a regular basis.Emma explains that we should clean this item at least every other month to keep it hygienic. After all, mattress protectors are designed to protect from spills, sweat and other dirt that we don't want on our pricey mattresses.Sign up to our newsletter for style and decor inspiration, house makeovers, project advice and more.'Generally, you should wash your mattress protector every other month,' she said. 'However, there are exceptions to this rule.’ Below, we outline those exceptions and what that means for how often you should wash a mattress protector.If someone in your house has been ill: If you regularly have guests sleeping over or just want to ensure your family members get rid of their illness quickly, you should wash the mattress protector as soon as possible. This will prevent the spread of illness, especially when the illness is transmissible, such as a cold or flu.If you have allergies: Although an air purifier can help with allergies, pollen, pet dander, and other pollutants can easily get caught in the fibres of a mattress protector. Therefore, if you suffer from allergies, you should wash your mattress protector once a month (or more).(Image credit: Future PLC)If you spill something on it: Moisture and mattress protectors don’t mix, and something as simple as water spilling from your glass can lead to bacteria growth and even mould. This then becomes a breeding ground for dust mites and allergens, affecting your skin and the length of time your mattress protector lasts. So, wash it as soon as you spill something (or at least the morning after).If pets sleep on the bed: Mattress protectors get dirty enough with humans sleeping on it, so adding a pet into the mix makes it even dirtier. Because of this, you should aim to wash a mattress protector at least once a month - or more if your dog gets particularly mucky paws or you struggle with pet dander. You can also use one of the best vacuum cleaners for pet hair to suck up any stray hair.(Image credit: Future/James French)When it comes to the best way to wash this household item, Emma also encourages you to check the details of your specific mattress protector - just as you would if you opt for a mattress topper instead of a mattress protector.'Your mattress protector should have a care label, which will give you precise instructions on the conditions in which they can be washed. However, if yours does not, or it has faded, I’d recommend using regular detergent on a 40ºC gentle wash, as anything too hot can damage the protective qualities.'She adds, 'And, if your mattress protector is stained, you will want to treat this beforehand. You can do this by using baking soda (a great natural cleaning hack) to work out the stains the same way you might with clothes.'And when it comes to drying? Emma advises, ‘'While you can put mattress protectors in the dryer if you keep it to a low temperature, I suggest air drying them as heat can cause damage to the protective qualities.' To speed things up, you can use a heated clothes airer.Just remember that mattress protectors should never be ironed or dry-cleaned. If you do either of these things, you may cause irreparable damage. John Lewis Natural Cotton Mattress Protector This is a great option if you're looking for a breathable cotton mattress protector.
