Here’s a curated mix of favorites—some I personally own and love, and others I think would make lovely gifts. Perfect for birthdays, celebrations, housewarmings, or just because. And if you order soon, many could even still arrive in time for Mother’s Day this year!

Sources for above: Cotton Throw Blanket (reversible) – I got this for my daughter Kylee as a gift. It’s so beautiful and a great size for a bed, back of the couch, or as an oversized throw! The reverse side is a creamy background. Beatrix Pottery Book – My daughter Courtney gave me this a few years ago. It’s a wonderful book to flip through with adorable Beatrix Potter illustrations and a fascinating story of Beatrix Potter’s life. Gold Stainless Steel Bag Clips – Practical little gift anyone would appreciate! We’ve had ours for years—they’re not only pretty, but also have a strong grip and have held up beautifully over time. Madagascar Vanilla Maple Syrup – I bought this deluxe maple syrup at Costco recently after trying it as a sample. It has real vanilla bean in it so it’s so tasty–love adding it into oat milk for my coffee as an extra treat! Paris Tea – I recently asked for tea recommendations on my Instagram stories and so many recommended this one. I got the loose leaf version to try and am really enjoying it! Mouse Card Holder – Courtney gifted me this, and it just makes me smile! It’s the perfect little stand for a photo, a quote card, or even as a cute way to label food or place cards when entertaining. Brass Cookbook Holder with Weighted Chains – I love having a cookbook holder in the kitchen (I often use it to display different seasonal cookbooks) and this brass one looks so classy. The weighted chains are handy for keeping your cookbook open or as a bookmark. It also can fold up for storage! Scrabble Bookshelf Board Game – We have a similar Monopoly version, and it’s so convenient to keep on the shelf for an impromptu game night. Stylish and functional! Canvas Tote with Hydrangeas – I got this tote recently and I’ve used it almost daily since! It’s a very good quality and the perfect size for so many needs. It has two color/pattern options (I got the hydrangea one and Courtney has the garden one!). Hydrangea Baseball Cap – I needed a hat for my sunny morning walks with my husband and couldn’t resist this one. The embroidered hydrangea is too cute and it even has a hydrangea pattern underneath! Stoneware Mugs (set of 8) – My recent mug addition, this is the cutest set of stoneware mugs! Each has a unique symbol. Perfect gift! These would be so charming hanging from hooks and will make fun memories for everyone who loves to “choose their own mug” when they are at our home! I shared a photo of them in this post. Scalloped Wood Frames – These are lovely and would make a perfect gift with a photo inside! More ideas below (click the thumbnails for details):",
