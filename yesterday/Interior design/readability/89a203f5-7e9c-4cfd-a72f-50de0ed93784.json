  "description": "Sydney’s inner-city suburbs are lined with rows of picturesque terrace houses standing side by side, but this one in Surry Hills hides a renovation like no other. Architect George took an experimental approach to transform the — initially unliveable — 1880s Victorian into a family home for a couple who’d lived their whole lives in apartments, and longed for a playful space that could ‘heighten their mood’. And the resulting residence is a masterclass in architectural expression.",

  "text": "This 1880s Victorian was uninhabitable when Studio George’s clients purchased it a few years ago. ‘The home had undergone a renovation in the 1970s and hadn’t been touched since. It was stripped of most of its original ornate detailing,’ Studio George director Dean Williams says. It gave the owners, a young professional couple who had lived in apartments their whole lives, an opportunity to really make the place their own — guided by Studio George’s confident creative approach. ‘They desired a home that had individuality and reflected their personality — not just a typical home with typical finishes and colours’, he adds. Colour was a big part of the brief, requesting playful hues that could ‘heighten their mood’. ‘Complimentary to the rich colour expression, they wanted the home to utilise natural materials such as Australian hardwood timbers and handmade tiles,’ Dean says. The work of famous Mexican architect Luis Barragan influenced the resulting home’s colour-blocked forms. The facade is now cloaked in a lavender-blue shade; the kitchen reveals mustard joinery with a yellow splashback; and the removal of the damaged rear wing made way for a living pavilion topped with elevated sculptural blocks — rendered in a dusty terracotta pink. Supported by custom brick pillars inside, the pink-clad upper level was designed to almost ‘float’ above a row of timber-framed glass doors, which open to the surrounding courtyard gardens. ‘As the gardens continue to grow, they will envelop the living space, providing dense greenery to all edges of the home,’ Dean says. ‘It was critical for the same material and colour be used on the walls and roof of the pink pavilions. We worked closely with the render company to ensure this material could wrap seamlessly from the walls, up onto the roof and into the concealed gutters.’ The interiors balance vibrant moments like the blue ceiling the with more earthy accents and paper lantern pendants. And the genius decision to line the border of the living room with limestone tiles makes the spotted gum flooring appear as if it was a timber rug. Upstairs, the two existing bedrooms were reconfigured to provide a bedroom, study and family bathroom — all united by singular swatches of deep blue. ‘We are quite proud of our (somewhat fearless) material and colour experimentation,’ Dean says. ‘We never chose an easier way to design or detail the building, as we were constantly striving for that individual architectural expression that our clients wanted.’ It took a year to design and a year to build, but the team’s close attention to detail makes House in Surry Hills stand out, in the best way. It’s now a one-of-a-kind oasis that sparks joy everywhere you look.",
