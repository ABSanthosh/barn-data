Most people know a cringe-worthy kitchen when they see one–shelves of beer bottles, fake fruit bowls, cheesy wine slogans–and yet people still use that decor. Some tacky kitchen designs are in style, so no one questions how tasteless they really are. But we have. We’ve gathered the tackiest of all tacky kitchen decor, and we’re not afraid to call it like it is. Obvious Room Labels Photo Credit: Youtube/Mimi’s Mixed Bag Yes, we already know where the KITCHEN is. That SINK and PANTRY are obviously a sink and pantry. Unless you have a young child who is learning to read, you don’t need room labels. It’s insulting to anyone who has been in a kitchen before. Of course, jar labels can help a guest know which container holds COFFEE and which one has SUGAR. But the contents inside jars aren’t obvious. A KITCHEN is very obvious. Kitchen Desks Photo Credit: DAVID BREWSTER/Star Tribune via Getty Images You know that you’re living in an old house when the kitchen includes a desk. Who wants to work in a kitchen? On top of that, who would entrust the safety of their laptop or work documents in an area where food splatters everywhere? It’s just a bad idea all around. In a room with boiling pots, oven timers, and fryers, the cacophony will make any desk worker go mad in minutes. That’s why most kitchen desks end up neglected and covered with papers and sweaters. Plastic Dishes Photo Credit: GEORGES GOBET/AFP/Getty Images If you’re a poor college student or 20-something-year-old, you might use plastic kitchenware because it’s cheaper, and you won’t be inviting anyone over. But if you can afford ceramic dishes, why settle for plastic ones? They’re barely even useful. Plastic dishes remind people of camping trips and broke college living. They’re a bundle of bad memories wrapped up in brittle, unnaturally-colored plates. Trust that you’ll feel ten times better about your life after throwing out the plastic dishware. Open Shelves Photo Credit: HGTV Open shelves tend to overlap with a Tuscan-style kitchen, but they deserve their own mention. Not only do they make your kitchen seem crowded and cluttered, but they’re also a hassle to clean. Imagine dusting around every single jar and pan that’s eight feet high. When you use an open-shelf kitchen, you don’t have as much flexibility in decorating because your kitchen items are your decorations. You’d have to own a set of quality china to get away with open shelves, and even that can appear tacky. The “Barnhouse” Theme Photo Credit: Glenn Koenig/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images You know the barn theme: kitchens with ceramic roosters, barn doors, hanging steel lights, and a milk pitcher with flowers in it. If those decorations appear in a modern kitchen, it looks out-of-place, like someone tried to re-enact the sixteenth-century French countryside. Barn-themed kitchens miss the mark because most aren’t actually in a barn or on a farm. Where are the live chickens? Nowhere. So why does the kitchen look like it should house a cow? Fake Fruit Bowls Photo Credit: Youtube/Joanna Gaines Fixer Upper You know what a kitchen is used for, right? Cooking real food. There is literally no point in owning a fake fruit bowl. Those shiny, plastic monstrosities scream “fake” and can be debunked from a mile away. And when they’re coated in dust, they look terrible. Just buy real fruit. Everyone likes fruit, and people who use fruit bowls have all their stuff together. Fake fruit just says, “I’m too lazy to purchase real fruit for my own kitchen.” A Displayed Alcohol Collection Photo Credit: TORSTEN BLACKWOOD/AFP/Getty Images People who fill walls or shelves with beer bottles fall into one of three categories: a bartender, a frat member, or someone with a drinking problem. Unless your guest knows you well, they may assume that you are in the third category. Or worse, you might come off as someone who wishes they were still in college. If you’re a bartender who likes to mix drinks for friends, a kitchen collection of cocktails may be convenient. But a display of beer for beer’s sake is just tacky. Slogans That Celebrate Wine Photo Credit: Twitter/@Argyle_Wines Wine decor mirrors the beer decor in that it signals a drinking problem. But on top of that, it comes off as try-hard, especially when it delineates the “sassy” or “quirky” personality of the kitchen owner. You’ve likely seen these signs, mugs, and dishes everywhere: “Dinner is poured,” “Vacay and rosé,” “I speak fluent wine,” etc. It’s not as charming or cute as the people who buy these decorations think. It’s cheesy at best. Weirdly Bright Refrigerator Colors Photo Credit: Pinterest/San Marcos Dance Studio Are you a character in Father Knows Best? No? Then, you don’t need the “1950s aesthetic” by painting your refrigerator firetruck red or bright turquoise. For the “retro” style to work all of the walls and furniture need to follow the same color scheme. Selecting a bright color for only your fridge makes it look out of place. Even if you are going for the retro look, neon colors hurt people’s eyes. You’ll have much better luck opting for a pastel palette, and even that can look off if not done skillfully. Noisily Patterned Cabinet Knobs Photo Credit: Pinterest/Renee Padfield The key to decorating a beautiful kitchen is coordinating colors and materials. Patterned knobs and handles do none of these things. Unless you find knobs that mirror your color scheme exactly, they’ll likely appear noisy and tacky. The worst choice you could possibly make is assigning different-colored handles to every single cabinet. That’s not “chic” or “vintage,” but a bad design idea. Since knobs are such a small detail, keep them minute and tasteful. Chevron Tiles Photo Credit: Pinterest/The Design Sheppard Chevron is the V-shaped pattern that’s often repeated as a zigzag. If you want your eyes to melt every time you walk into your kitchen, install chevron tiles. Not only is this design distracting, but also obscures all the important items like pots and towels. Even worse than chevron tiles on the wall are chevron tiles on the floor. The entire design is dizzying to say least. Keep your kitchen pleasant to look at, and take away glaring chevron design from your home. Mason Jar Decorations Photo Credit: Pinterest/shanieka Over the past couple of years, mason jars have become the new trendy glasses in hipster cafes. If you aren’t bottling homemade sauce or jam, you probably own mason jars for the aesthetic. It isn’t as cool as it once was–unless you want to come off as a hipster, of course. Sure, mason jars are handy tools for pressure-sealing dried herbs and sauces. But they’re not easy to drink out of. And decorating a room with mason jar lights and trinkets is the new “basic.” Tuscan Kitchen Decor Photo Credit: DeAgostini/Getty Images Even if you haven’t heard the term, you’ve likely seen Tuscan kitchens: wooden furniture, hanging pots and pans, chandeliers, and Italian tiles above the stove. In restaurants, this decor looks professional. In homes, this aesthetic looks like you’re trying to make it onto Food Network. Tuscan kitchens work for professional chefs who actually need their pans and garlic cloves within arm’s reach. Average people aren’t Italian chefs, so they don’t need to act like they are. Crowding Your Kitchen With Plants Photo Credit: Pinterest/Katarina Yes, houseplants look beautiful. But your kitchen isn’t a garden; it’s a kitchen. Shoving ferns and succulents all over the room will inevitably coat them in grime, and potentially set the plants ablaze if you hang them over your stove. Plus, you don’t want to cross-contaminate all your food, do you? Too many plants give off the “flower child” vibe of someone who’s trying to look more connected with the earth than they actually are. Even herbalists dedicate their garden to growing food, not their kitchen. Lace Tablecloths Photo Credit: Twitter/@southernladyest In the past, lace was considered a status symbol because it was made by hand. Nowadays, lace is cheaply made and bought at a low price. These tablecloths don’t have the same “Victorian charm” that they did in the early twentieth century. Lace is also incredibly fragile, meaning that it won’t last long on a well-used kitchen table. And layering white-on-white with lace will remind people of church altars. Opt for a nice, sturdy, elegantly-patterned tablecloth instead. Distressed Kitchen Furniture Photo Credit: Pinterest/Rose Petals and Pearls Distressed furniture is purposefully worn down so that it looks like an antique piece. If you distress one or two pieces, you can make your home look more shabby chic. But imagine walking through a modern home and then suddenly entering an “antique” kitchen. It’s jarring, right? Distressed cabinets and drawers don’t complement modern kitchens with tile or marble. When you push the “antique” look on a modern setting, people will notice. Either shabby-chic-up all of your home or none of it. Stainless Steel Industrial Stoves Photo Credit: View Pictures/Universal Images Group via Getty Images On the opposite end of vintage tackiness, we have modern tackiness. The “overly modern” look often encapsulates stainless steel stoves, counters, microwaves, or other appliances. While professional kitchens use stainless steel for cleanliness, family homes don’t need it. The problem with stainless steel is that too much of it makes your house look like a scene from I, Robot. You don’t want your guests to think that you’re trying to time travel, do you? Fake Houseplants Are So Tacky Photo Credit: Pinterest/parachutehome \u0026 zanedevlin/Pinterest In an issue of the Property Brothers’ home decor publication Reveal, gardening expert Rebecca Bullene recommends using real houseplants in the home. The reason is that real plants bring a little bit of the outdoors inside and can even ease stress. In your kitchen, try growing some fresh herbs that you can use while cooking. Another reason for skipping the fake plants is that they usually look pretty unrealistic. They can also accumulate a bunch of dust, which isn’t a good look in anyone’s kitchen. All-White Kitchens Photo Credit: Pinterest/Decoholic All-white kitchens are not only an eyesore but also a hassle to keep clean. Kitchens are messy places; there’s no avoiding red sauce splatters and crumbs all over the counter. The white backdrop will highlight these tiny messes, which require people to clean their kitchens 24/7. That’s also the reason why hospitals are painted white: it makes sanitation easier. Do you want your kitchen to feel like a hospital room or a home? Probably the latter. Leave the white for a laboratory. Overlapping Several Colors Photo Credit: Unspouse My House Most kitchens are mainly grey, black, or cream—basic colors that are gentle on the eyes. But those devoted to a 1950s chic look may overlay bright colors like red, yellow, blue, and white. The color scheme may work in a burger diner but not in a home. Processing too many colors at once is a recipe for migraines. If your kitchen requires a seizure warning, you need to tone it down for everybody’s sake.

You don’t want your guests to think that you’re trying to time travel, do you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"page-18\"\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eFake Houseplants Are So Tacky\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://www.bleacherbreaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/scott-plants-51155.jpg?width=480\" media=\"(max-width: 481px)\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" title=\"scott-plants\" src=\"https://www.bleacherbreaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/scott-plants-51155.jpg?width=800\u0026amp;height=333\" alt=\"scott-plants\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" data-pin-nopin=\"true\"/\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cpicture\u003ePhoto Credit: \u003c/picture\u003ePinterest/parachutehome \u0026amp; zanedevlin/Pinterest\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an issue of the Property Brothers’ home decor publication\u003ci\u003e Reveal,\u003c/i\u003e gardening expert Rebecca Bullene recommends using real houseplants in the home. The reason is that real plants bring a little bit of the outdoors inside and can even ease stress. In your kitchen, try growing some fresh herbs that you can use while cooking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother reason for skipping the fake plants is that they usually look pretty unrealistic.

Kitchens are messy places; there’s no avoiding red sauce splatters and crumbs all over the counter.
