If you love vintage and unique decor in your home, then the Facebook Marketplace will become your favorite source for interesting pieces!Â  Recently, especially over the past year or so, the seasonal decor releases at places like Target and Walmart are just hitting me differently.Â  It's hard to find something unique -- all of the decor items start to look the same after a while.Â  Over the past few years I've fallen back in love with thrifting and antiquing. It helps that our teenage son enjoys it too -- he loves looking for vintage sports memorabilia.Â  Late last year I clicked on the little marketplace button at the bottom of my FB page while winding down in bed one night. I was surprised at all of the beautiful pieces that were both interesting and full of character.Â  I started logging in everyday to check out the finds. It's easy to get slightly addicted once you find a few treasures!Â  In the past few months I've learned a lot about successfully shopping on this app, so figured I would share my tips along with some of my finds! 1. Search for keywords and add filters. Looking through all of the listings can become a major time suck, so searching by terms helps to whittle down the items.Â  You can use any word you'd like -- wood or metal, new or used. Or search a specific design style you love like modern or farmhouse. Not only can you use keywords, but you can set a price range, condition, color and more to filter your search: I love just about anything brass, so I use that every so often to look for treasures. These brass library bookends were one of my first finds: Love the candlestick in front of the books!Â  This post may containÂ affiliate links for yourÂ convenience. I may earn a small commission whenÂ you make a purchase through links.Â  This brass planter was in great condition:Â  And this vintage brass magazine rack was perfect for my office:Â  Does anyone else still read magazines? I love them! I adore cloisonnÃ© brass bowls -- I found one years ago and have it displayed in my office:Â  I found another one on Facebook recently. It was already pretty with the patina:Â  But an absolute stunner when cleaned up!:Â  The colors are so much more vibrant! You can also set up a notification for certain keywords so you'll be notified about new listings right away! 2. Be safe during pick up.Â  I avoided shopping the marketplace for years because I was concerned about safety. Now I always let my husband know where I'm going and only do porch pick up.Â  Also, I do NOT meet people at a specified location, even if it's outside. I would meet at the police station perhaps, but at a random gas station, no. I know that's supposed to be safer, but I'd much rather pick up something on a porch than meet face to face. I could be weird about that!Â  I highly discourage going into a home to get an item. When I've purchased furniture second hand over the years, I always ask that it is left on a porch or driveway.Â  When I picked up the cane chair I recently recovered, the seller had it inside her front porch. That's the furthest I've stepped into someone's house: Some may find that extreme, but better safe than sorry!Â  I've learned these days most transactions are completed without saying a word to someone in person! 3. Pay attention to sizes.Â  I'm shocked at how often sellers don't include dimensions! Always ask, and if they are in the description, make sure you pay attention. ðŸ˜‚ I picked up this beautiful capiz shell box and round brass tray with handles and was shocked at how small they were -- the photos made them look three times the size:Â  But that was my fault, I didn't pay attention to the measurements and just assumed. I ended up paying more than I would have if I had seen the sizes, but I do love the pieces!Â  The adorable little tray holds our drink coasters and I placed our matches in the pretty little box:Â  4. Communication is key.Â  If I'm interested in something, instead of just clicking the \"Hello, is this still available?\" message, I make a little more effort: Even just writing \"Hi there!\" or \"Good morning!\" first helps to stand out and lets the seller know you are truly interested.Â  Communicate as much as possible about pick up. I haven't sold on FB myself, but I can't even imagine how many messages people get and how often they are stood up! I try to communicate when I'll pick up and let them know if that will change.Â  By the way, I don't pay for the item (usually via Venmo) until I've had a chance to look it over and have it in hand. 5. Set a radius for your search.Â  You can filter searches to however many miles around you. I have mine set to a 15 mile bubble around us -- too often I was discovering exactly what I was looking for, just to find it was hours away.Â  You can keep the same distance away from your home, but just move your \"bubble\" around to the north, south, whatever, to discover new finds. (I find that FB still shows me plenty outside of my specifications, which can get frustrating.) Sometimes sellers will ship! I find that they usually list that in their description. One of my all time favorite second-hand finds was this nautical brass light:Â  The seller shipped it out the next day and I had a couple days later. I only did that because I LOVED this sweet little lamp -- so check out the \"delivery\" filter to only show sellers that will deliver or ship.Â  I think this would be most helpful when looking for something super specific, or furniture that is an exact size or style that you like.Â  6. Don't hesitate to hesitate.Â  If you don't have a spot in mind for it, or feel like the price is too high...hesitate. You can always save (hit the heart button) the item for later.Â  I've always enjoyed thrifting and antiquing, but years ago I pulled back on it because I was spending way too much money and filling our garage with \"potential\" projects. Â  The clutter weighed on me...regret would often set in because I felt like I had to grab the piece right then or it would be gone forever.Â  Now I've learned if it's meant to be, it will be. Walk away for a bit to see if you REALLY love it as much as you think.Â  Also, I only purchase something if I know exactly where it will go and how I will display it. If I can't think of where I would place or use it in our home, I won't buy it.Â  6. Do your research. If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. I've seen the same seller list a \"brand new in box\" vacuum for Â $50 when the retail price is $750. Something is up with that one! I once inquired about a light fixture and never heard back from the seller, but I was interested enough that I took a screenshot of the item and did a Google image search. Turns out that exact light (with the same photo) was listed for a fraction of the price on Amazon! I've also seen plenty of listings that use the word \"vintage\" in the description when I know for a fact it's from Target. Ha! So just do some digging if something feels off.Â  If it doesn't feel right, just save the listing and come back to it later after doing some research.Â  Pay attention to seller ratings and read the reviews!Â  I hope these tips help if you try out Facebook Marketplace! If you're smart about it, it's a wonderful tool for finding truly lovely and unique decor for your home without breaking the bank. There's something special about decorating with pieces that have a history!Â  Do you shop the marketplace often? Please share any additional tips in the comments!",

One of my all time favorite second-hand finds was this nautical\n    brass light:Â \n  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8iZnGazvbBOqoyDKDhOiRegTiw2wZa7xsZE3YhpIx2FtKLNISNRaStFEHrrxO8zMd_0VuRPaDwkaQWeLQWdib82WL0ZYqfyQ7kUO8GMkdXNcW1xMCmzWFZnACCuvGP4kJRRqHD4_GKOyMtRFmdVnRw-6H87t9aEQHFaU4-sNipeDfLQ1J2KM1PuFVGp4/s1349/nautical%20brass%20light.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"vintage brass nautical light\" data-original-height=\"1349\" data-original-width=\"1000\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8iZnGazvbBOqoyDKDhOiRegTiw2wZa7xsZE3YhpIx2FtKLNISNRaStFEHrrxO8zMd_0VuRPaDwkaQWeLQWdib82WL0ZYqfyQ7kUO8GMkdXNcW1xMCmzWFZnACCuvGP4kJRRqHD4_GKOyMtRFmdVnRw-6H87t9aEQHFaU4-sNipeDfLQ1J2KM1PuFVGp4/s16000-rw/nautical%20brass%20light.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003e\n    The seller shipped it out the next day and I had a couple days later. I only\n    did that because I LOVED this sweet little lamp -- so check out the\n    \u0026#34;delivery\u0026#34; filter to only show sellers that will deliver or ship.Â \n  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003cp\u003e\n    I think this would be most helpful when looking for something super\n    specific, or furniture that is an exact size or style that you like.Â \n  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003ch3\u003e\n    \u003cspan\u003e6.

You can always save (hit the heart button) the item for\n      later.Â \u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \n    \u003cp\u003e\n      I\u0026#39;ve always enjoyed thrifting and antiquing, but years ago I pulled back\n      on it because I was spending way too much money and filling our garage\n      with \u0026#34;potential\u0026#34; projects. Â \n    \u003c/p\u003e\n    \n    \u003cp\u003e\n      The clutter weighed on me...regret would often set in because I felt like\n      I had to grab the piece \u003ci\u003eright then\u003c/i\u003e or it would be gone\n      forever.Â \n    \u003c/p\u003e\n    \n    \u003cp\u003e\n      Now I\u0026#39;ve learned if it\u0026#39;s meant to be, it will be. Walk away for a bit to\n      see if you REALLY love it as much as you think.Â \n    \u003c/p\u003e\n    \n    \u003cp\u003e\n      Also, I only purchase something if I know \u003cb\u003eexactly\u003c/b\u003e where it will go\n      and how I will display it. If I can\u0026#39;t think of where I would place or use\n      it in our home, I won\u0026#39;t buy it.Â \n    \u003c/p\u003e\n    \n    \u003ch3\u003e6. Do your research.\u003c/h3\u003e\n    \n    \u003cp\u003e\n      If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. I\u0026#39;ve seen the same seller\n      list a \u0026#34;brand new in box\u0026#34; vacuum for Â $50 when the retail price is\n      $750. Something is up with that one!\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n    \n    \u003cp\u003e\n      I once inquired about a light fixture and never heard back from the\n      seller, but I was interested enough that I took a screenshot of the item\n      and did\n      \u003ca href=\"https://images.google.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea Google image search\u003c/a\u003e. Turns out that \u003ci\u003eexact\u003c/i\u003e light (with the same photo) was listed for\n      a fraction of the price on Amazon!\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n    \n    \u003cp\u003e\n      I\u0026#39;ve also seen plenty of listings that use the word \u0026#34;vintage\u0026#34; in the\n      description when I know for a fact it\u0026#39;s from Target. Ha! So just do some\n      digging if something feels off.Â \n    \u003c/p\u003e\n    \n    \u003cp\u003e\n      If it doesn\u0026#39;t feel right, just save the listing and come back to it later\n      after doing some research.Â \n    \u003c/p\u003e\n    \n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cblockquote\u003e\n        Pay attention to seller ratings and read the reviews!Â \n      \u003c/blockquote\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cp\u003e\n      I hope these tips help if you try out Facebook Marketplace!
