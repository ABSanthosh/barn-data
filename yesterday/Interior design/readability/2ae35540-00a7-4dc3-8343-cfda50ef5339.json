By focusing on smaller upgrades that enhance your home’s comfort, functionality, and yes, beauty, you can make your home feel lavish without breaking the bank. Here are eight simple yet luxurious home upgrades you won’t regret making. 1. Soft-Close Cabinets and Drawers Slamming kitchen cabinets and drawers may not seem like a big deal—until you upgrade to soft-close hinges that is. Soft-close tracks and hinges help prevent noise, reduce wear and tear, and make your home more gentle, in a way. They’re easy to install and instantly make your space feel smoother and more high-end. It’s a small change, but you’ll appreciate the quiet, effortless motion every time you reach for a plate or utensil. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / staRRush 2. High-Quality Bedding Luxury hotels don’t skimp on bedding, and neither should you. Swapping out your standard sheets for high-thread-count cotton or linen can absolutely transform how you sleep. A well-made bed with plush pillows and a breathable duvet creates a cozy, inviting reprieve at the end of a long day. Investing in a quality mattress topper can also make a difference, providing some extra comfort without needing to replace your entire mattress. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / Anikona 3. Lighting Dimmers Lighting sets the mood of a room, and dimmer switches let you control that mood. Bright light is great for specific tasks, but softer lighting creates a warm and inviting atmosphere. Installing dimmers in your any room (though your main living space and bedroom should be prioritized here) allows you to adjust the ambiance to match the moment. Smart dimmers even let you control brightness levels from your phone, making it even easier to craft your home experience. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / monkeybusiness 4. A Filtered Water Tap Filtered water straight from the tap is a small upgrade that makes a big difference. It tastes fresher, is better for your health, and eliminates the need for plastic water bottles. Plus, you’ll find yourself drinking more water, which is a nice bonus. You can also extend this to your bathroom by switching to a filtered shower head, which helps soften the water and thus helps your hair and skin health. We use water every day, it should be the best water you can get! Photo Credit: Envato Elements / pro_creator 5. Luxurious Hand Soap and Towels Sometimes, luxury is in the details. High-quality hand soap with a rich scent and thick, plush towels elevate even the simplest task of washing your hands. Guests will absolutely notice, especially if your bathroom is otherwise clean or stylish, but more importantly, you’ll enjoy the experience every day. Switching to organic, moisturizing hand soaps and oversized, absorbent towels is a small upgrade that leaves you feeling your best multiple times a day.

A smart thermostat learns your habits and adjusts the temperature accordingly. Not only will the temperature in your home always feel just right, it’s also more energy efficient and eco-friendly! It’s a simple upgrade that pays for itself over time by reducing energy costs. Like the smart lights, many smart thermostats also give you the ability to control your home’s temperature remotely, so you can always walk into a perfectly heated or cooled space.

All of these ideas bring simplicity, comfort, and convenience to your home in ways that you’ll appreciate every single day. Think of luxury as a feeling rather than a price point, then figure out what luxury feels like to you. Then, find ways to fit that feeling into your everyday life!

Guests will absolutely notice, especially if your bathroom is otherwise clean or stylish, but more importantly, you’ll enjoy the experience every day. Switching to organic, moisturizing hand soaps and oversized, absorbent towels is a small upgrade that leaves you feeling your best multiple times a day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_267523\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-267523\"\u003e            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/washing-hands-2025-03-10-00-47-43-utc-44231-scaled.jpg?width=480\" media=\"(max-width: 481px)\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1710\"/\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/washing-hands-2025-03-10-00-47-43-utc-44231-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"An aerial photo of someone washing their hands in a bathroom sink.\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1710\" srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/washing-hands-2025-03-10-00-47-43-utc-44231-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/washing-hands-2025-03-10-00-47-43-utc-44231-270x180.jpg 270w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/washing-hands-2025-03-10-00-47-43-utc-44231-921x615.jpg 921w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/washing-hands-2025-03-10-00-47-43-utc-44231-768x513.jpg 768w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/washing-hands-2025-03-10-00-47-43-utc-44231-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/washing-hands-2025-03-10-00-47-43-utc-44231-2048x1368.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/washing-hands-2025-03-10-00-47-43-utc-44231-385x257.jpg 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"/\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\n                \n                \n            \u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-267523\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://elements.envato.com/washing-hands-DZU5AVQ\"\u003ePhoto Credit: Envato Elements / Longstocking\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e6.

A smart thermostat learns your habits and adjusts the temperature accordingly. Not only will the temperature in your home always feel just right, it’s also more energy efficient and eco-friendly!
