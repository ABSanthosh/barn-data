  "text": "Nestled in the lush surroundings of Pererenan, Bali, this newly unveiled residence by architect Alexis Dornier is not just a home; it’s a celebration of imagination, movement, and mindful living. Merging contemporary architectural principles with a deep sensitivity to environment and emotion, the house offers a fresh take on tropical modernism, one where form and fun are equally valued. At the heart of the design lies a striking feature: a bold central void that quite literally opens the house from within. This architectural centerpiece runs vertically through the home, bringing in natural light, airflow, and visual continuity across its multiple levels. But more than just serving as an aesthetic or environmental device, this void becomes a canvas for a bold creative gesture, a sculptural slide that winds its way down the core. Designer: Alexis Dornier Far from a novelty, the slide represents a radical rethinking of how we interact with our living spaces. Finished in a sleek, glossy material that makes it gleam against the more organic textures of the home, it symbolizes playfulness and encourages spontaneity. For Dornier, the slide isn’t just about moving between floors; it’s about breaking down the formality often associated with modern architecture and replacing it with something more human, more joyful. Accompanying the slide is a handrail system with a conveyor-belt-like design that follows the void’s energy. This flowing, sculptural form not only complements the motion of the slide but also accentuates the sense of movement throughout the house. Together with the open floor plans and careful visual connections, it gives the impression that the home is in constant dialogue with its inhabitants, alive, dynamic, and responsive. On the ground level, the void opens onto a serene pool, offering a moment of balance and calm. It’s a thoughtful juxtaposition, the stillness of water against the momentum of the slide, and it anchors the home with a tranquil presence. The pool is surrounded by open-air lounge spaces, tropical landscaping, and rich natural textures, all of which take full advantage of Bali’s climate and natural beauty. Materiality plays a key role in the home’s inviting character. The interiors are wrapped in warm wooden finishes, giving it the feel of a luxurious cabin nestled within the forest. These wood surfaces soften the modern lines of the structure and introduce a comforting sense of tactility. Elsewhere, steel and glass are used sparingly but effectively to frame views and create contrast, allowing the architecture to feel both grounded and light. Access to the various floors is provided not just by the slide but also by a beautifully crafted wood and steel staircase, which serves as a more subtle architectural centerpiece. The staircases, much like the slide, are more than functional; they’re expressive and sculptural, helping define the interior atmosphere. The home features several bedrooms and bathrooms on its upper levels, each designed to be a sanctuary of peace. Carefully considered lighting enhances the calming ambiance, while large openings offer expansive views of the surrounding greenery. These views not only connect the inside with nature but also ensure privacy, making the spaces feel both open and protected. Among the many standout features is an open-air outdoor gym, a large entertaining lounge, and a grand pivoting front door that opens into a dining area defined by an oversized dining table, a space clearly designed for gathering, sharing, and community.",
