  "text": "Tiny house companies constantly strive to innovate and find new methods to maximize every square foot of available space. One such company, Modern Tiny Living, has developed a clever strategy with its Shadow model. This innovative tiny house design includes a versatile living room that can comfortably accommodate up to six people. It offers ample storage options and cleverly transforms into a guest bed when needed, showcasing an impressive use of space. The Shadow model is constructed on a double-axle trailer, and with a length of 24 feet (approximately 7.32 meters), it falls on the smaller end of the spectrum for tiny houses in North America. This compact size is comparable to some of the compact European models, such as the Hytta. The design of the Shadow is inspired by farmhouse-style architecture, which gives it a charming and rustic appeal. The exterior is finished with smart siding, providing a sleek and polished appearance. The house also features a small storage box located outside, further enhancing its practicality and storage capabilities. Designer: Modern Tiny Living Upon entering the home, you’ll find yourself in the living area. This section of the house is elevated and can be reached by climbing a few steps. The additional height is ingeniously utilized to offer substantial storage space, featuring both an underfloor hatch and sizable drawers. As previously noted, this living area can comfortably seat up to six people, making it an ideal spot for entertaining guests. It also easily converts into a guest bed, adding to its functionality and convenience. In another part of the tiny house, you’ll discover the well-equipped kitchen. This area is thoughtfully designed to include a range of modern appliances, ensuring all your culinary needs are met. It features an electric oven and a two-burner induction stove. You’ll also find a microwave for quick heating, a fridge/freezer to keep your groceries fresh, and a convenient washer/dryer unit to handle your laundry needs. It also includes a cozy breakfast bar that seats two, complete with comfortable stools, making it an ideal spot for enjoying your morning coffee or a quick meal. The kitchen counter seamlessly extends into a small desk area, thoughtfully designed to serve as a home office. This space is perfect for those who work from home or need a dedicated area for managing household tasks, combining practicality with the compact charm of the tiny house. Situated on the opposite side of the house from the living room, the bathroom is designed to be compact yet fully functional. It features a convenient shower, a standard flushing toilet, and a nicely integrated sink.  The Shadow includes a single bedroom, which is accessible via a staircase that cleverly incorporates additional storage. This bedroom is designed as a typical tiny house loft, characterized by its low ceiling. It houses a comfortable double bed, along with some storage options, providing a cozy and efficient sleeping area. The Shadow model was recently completed for a client, showcasing Modern Tiny Living’s craftsmanship. While the exact price of this particular model hasn’t been disclosed, it is part of Modern Tiny Living’s Kokosing series. This series of tiny houses is known for its quality and thoughtful design, with prices starting at approximately US$99,000.",
