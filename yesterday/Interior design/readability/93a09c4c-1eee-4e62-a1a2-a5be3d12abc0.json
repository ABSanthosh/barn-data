All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.My bed finally feels like a cloud. I’ve been trying to achieve this effect for a long time, testing out different combinations of soft mattress toppers, sheets, and — of course — comforters. The comforter is the key piece to the equation, in my opinion, and it’s also one of the more difficult ones to get right. Mostly because finding one that’s the perfect weight is a challenge. For a bed to truly reach cloud-like status, the comforter needs to be fluffy and plush, but light enough that you don’t feel suffocated underneath it and can use it as a layering piece in the winter.Until I got my hands on Pure Parima’s down alternative comforter, I was making do with a quilt and a blanket, having just ditched my well-worn IKEA duvet insert. While the combo was good enough for summer, it simply wasn’t cozy enough when the weather turned colder. Now that my New York City apartment has become an icebox — I’m trying to save on my energy bill — my bed has become especially important. Pure Parima’s Lightweight Down Alternative Duvet Insert is getting me through the freezing winter, and it makes me never want to leave my cloud-like setup. What’s more, it’s currently 20% off for Cyber Week!What Is the Lightweight Down Alternative Duvet Insert?For those who are unfamiliar, Pure Parima is a luxury bedding brand known for its 100% Egyptian cotton. It’s been approved by the AT team for years, with our Style Editor, Blair, saying that the brand’s sheets are “the softest [she’s] ever slept on.” I was similarly impressed by its towels. All of Pure Parima’s products are certified by the Cotton Egypt Association, guaranteeing that it’s 100% authentic.The care that’s taken into sourcing the materials is also carried over into this comforter’s construction. The cotton sateen shell encases premium (and hypoallergenic) alternative down fill, which has a loft that mimics real goose down while still being eco-friendly. The shell has a three-dimensional baffle-box construction to keep the spiraled microfibers evenly distributed. Plus, each seam is double-stitched to make sure it lasts, and duvet loops on each corner top off the smart design.Why I Love the Lightweight Down Alternative Duvet InsertHaving been familiar with the brand’s luxe towels — and hearing my coworkers sing the praises of its bedding — I had high expectations for this Pure Parima comforter, and it has lived up to all of them. At first I used the comforter inside of a linen duvet cover (where it didn’t budge). This was during the late summer, so I used it on its own in my stuffy studio apartment. Despite its impressive fluff, the comforter has never felt oppressive — it just keeps me cozy and balanced all night long. As fall gave way to winter, I’ve found it to be an excellent piece of transitional bedding, too. I decided to remove the duvet cover then to switch up the look, revealing its simple box stitch, satin piping, and room-brightening white color. Over the past few weeks, I placed a lightweight quilt on top of it, and the overall effect has been seriously cozy. I’m warm, but I’m not waking up drenched in sweat. The cotton shell is so soft and its fill is so cushiony that I have a hard time emerging from my cocoon in the morning. Further, after several months of use and a couple of washes, the comforter looks just as pristine as the day it arrived in the mail. It folds up surprisingly small to fit in the washing machine (which also would help with storage, if I ever took it off of my bed).Replacing worn bedding can become pricey, so my Pure Parima comforter is an investment that has paid (and will continue to pay) off. It works during any season, on its own or layered, and I can already tell that it’s going to hold up so much longer than my old IKEA comforter did. Now that this luxe comforter is a permanent fixture in my space, my bed feels like a cloud year-round.Buy: Pure Parima Lightweight Down Alternative Duvet Insert, $239.20 (normally $299)Apartment Therapy's Home RunsGet full reviews of editor-favorite finds sent twice a week to your inbox.",
