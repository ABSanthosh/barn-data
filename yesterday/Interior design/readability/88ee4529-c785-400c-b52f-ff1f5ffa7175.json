  "description": "A young family purchased a 1950s house in Mona Vale, on Sydney’s Northern Beaches, for its elevated position on the street, original charm, and promise of a coastal lifestyle. They wanted to expand the home without majorly extending its original footprint, calling on Studio Pulp to introduce only strategic additions for improved functionality and flow. The clients’ vision was clear; while the design should reference iconic forms and shapes of the mid-century era, the house needed to feel like a modern, entirely new dwelling.",

  "text": "The existing 1950s house on this Mona Vale site comprised two levels, including a lower ground floor area that was largely forgotten. Add to that, ‘The house failed to make the most of its incredible position, with no access to the views that could have enhanced the living experience’ says Benjamin Selke, director at Studio Pulp. ‘The home was divided into a maze of small rooms, each sectioned off in a way that felt disconnected and inefficient. ‘It was clear the layout needed a major overhaul, as the house’s configuration didn’t suit the modern family lifestyle.’ The three-bedroom, two-bathroom house was renovated to become a six-bedroom, four-bathroom home over three storeys. Most of these changes were achieved through reconfiguring the existing spaces, with the exception of a new garage wing, featuring two new bedrooms and a bathroom positioned at a half-level between the existing ground floor, and a newly created first-floor extension. ‘This unique positioning of the bedrooms created a sense of separation, offering both privacy and connection to the rest of the home,’ says Benjamin. The communal spaces have been transformed, highlighting a central kitchen as part of a generous open-plan area that flows onto the backyard with a new circular pool. The updated lower level is self-contained (complete with a bedroom, living area, kitchen, and bathroom) to serve as a versatile granny flat, if required. The material palette of the renovated interiors references original mid-century design and the home’s coastal location. Exposed timber ceilings have been maintained, and green bathroom tiles are a nod to olive mosaics in the original residence. Benjamin adds, ‘We wanted to reimagine the space, making the most of the house’s elevated position and natural surroundings, while reintroducing those iconic design touches that made the original structure so special. ‘This was the spark that guided the aesthetic vision for the transformation, ensuring that the home would feel both nostalgic and forward thinking.’ New colours throughout the home’s design and styling reflect the clients, described by Benjamin as ‘vibrant, distinctive, and anything but typical.’ ‘They sought a home that incorporated splashes of colour and bold design choices, but with careful thought to the future,’ he says. The kitchen, for instance, features cabinetry painted in a soft green-blue tone, paired with a contrasting pink terrazzo benchtop. Natural oak timber finishes in key areas provide balance, as seen on the kitchen cabinetry, flooring, and bathroom joinery that soften the overall design while adding a layer of warmth and texture. Studio Pulp also added a natural timber tone on the front balcony. ‘This addition not only helped to articulate the architectural lines but added depth to the exterior,’ says Benjamin. ‘The one bold pop of colour on the exterior was the front door — a vibrant hue that sets the tone for what awaits inside, offering a glimpse into the playful, eclectic interior design.’ While technically an alterations and additions project, this property feels like an entirely new house that has visually and practically transformed how the owners live. ‘The new layout offers a slow journey through the spaces, each with its own story. ‘It’s a home for enjoying moments with family and friends, where oversized glazed doors stay open, the gentle breeze moves the sheer curtains, and the architectural elements tell a story of history, calmly sitting in harmony with its street presence,’ says Benjamin. ‘Through a careful balance of light, space, colour, and architectural references to mid-century design, we created a home that felt personal, timeless, and ultimately, theirs.’",
