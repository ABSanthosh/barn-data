  "text": "Mara’s Salone del mobile 2025 showcaseAt Salone del Mobile.Milano 2025, Italian furniture company Mara opened the chapter to its most immersive narrative yet, titled Design For All — a multisensory installation that transformed furniture into storytelling. Through colored rooms, tactile materials, and sculptural silhouettes, Mara’s showcase mapped the trajectory of design that transcends context: from offices to homes, hospitality to open-air retreats. Among standouts were the new Typo Lounge Chair \u0026 Ottoman by AMDL Circle, a soft evolution of its graphic predecessor, alongside the modular Elle system by Ferruccio Laviani and the elegant Foil Bench by Christophe Pillet.Each piece, staged within chromatic settings and eco-inspired layouts, shaped a vision of furniture as a flexible companion to contemporary life. The different spaces evoked an expressive, engaging experience while contributing to a cohesive vision, affirming Mara’s place at the intersection of lifestyle and architecture, both indoors and out.the world of Mara becomes bigger, embracing an ever-wider range of furnishings | all images courtesy of Maraunveiling design versatility From AMDL Circle to Christophe PilletHeadquartered in Passirano, Brescia, Mara is a design-centric manufacturer known for its finely engineered furniture that blends clean aesthetics with clever functionality. With a foundation in office and contract solutions, Mara has steadily extended its design language into the residential and outdoor spheres. Their 2025 presentation at Salone marked a new chapter in this evolution, reflecting a deeper synergy between industrial know-how and global creative partnerships.Collaborations with renowned designers such as Michele De Lucchi’s AMDL Circle, Ferruccio Laviani, Christophe Pillet, and Marcello Ziliani contributed fresh perspectives while preserving Mara’s signature DNA: a harmony between innovation, modularity, and timeless design. The showcase wasn’t just a product display—it was a living portfolio of Mara’s capacity to adapt, transform, and inspire across design landscapes.Typo Chair and Typo Table designed by AMDL Circle, founded by Michele de LucchiTypo Lounge, Elle by Laviani, and outdoor-ready IconsMara’s 2025 collection is a curated study in adaptable design—pieces that shift seamlessly between professional, domestic, and outdoor contexts without sacrificing visual or tactile impact. Leading the charge was the Typo family’s newest member: the Typo Lounge Chair \u0026 Ottoman, designed by AMDL Circle. Evolved from the original Typo chair, this version transforms the concept into a softer, more meditative object. Its distinctive square-section metal tubing—bent with precise craftsmanship—frames a criss-cross base that fuses structure with sculptural poise. Combined with its plush upholstery and optional footrest, Typo Lounge invites long hours of comfort whether in a corporate lounge or living room corner.But the narrative didn’t stop at comfort. The lounge’s presence was balanced by other extensions—like the Typo Soft, which emphasized conviviality and domestic use with its inviting padding and fluid contours. The Typo Table, minimalist and made for both indoor and outdoor settings, rounds out the ecosystem with its monochrome metal finish and versatile tabletops in laminate, melamine, or FENIX. Altogether, the Typo collection moves fluidly through different atmospheres—its graphic language both bold and adaptable.Typo Lounge Chair with Typo OttomanExpanding on versatility, Foil Bench, a square reinterpretation of a table by Christophe Pillet, added elegance and modular utility to the mix. Presented in a limited edition, its sleek Antolini marble top contrasted with an industrial metal frame and hidden drawers. This duality of raw and refined is typical of Mara’s approach. Nearby, Elle, the modular bookcase system by Ferruccio Laviani, was shown in various configurations—especially its new Elle Consolle, lowered for passageways and entrances but no less sculptural. These pieces bridge practicality and presence, making a statement while staying useful.Foil Desk with laminate top and Foil Bench with double tops, entirely in metal 100% recyclable, designed by Christophe PilletIn the dining zone, the Follow Meeting Cone Large table brought patented mechanics into the social sphere. Its signature feature: an intuitive, mechanical height-adjustment system that accommodates both standing and seated gatherings. With a matching fixed-base option, the table becomes a hub for collaboration, meals, or casual conversation—always grounded in ergonomic intelligence. Meanwhile, the Icon Soft Metal, a fresh take on Ziliani’s chair design, appeared fully upholstered and mounted on a new slender metal base, accentuating its architectural grace.Follow Meeting Cone Large, a large dining and meeting table featuring an innovative, patented height-adjustment systemOutdoors, Mara leaned into the open-air lifestyle with refined purpose. Icon Outdoor, another extension by Ziliani, was conceived to retain the elegance of its indoor sibling while embracing outdoor durability. Its polypropylene shell, optionally paired with a waterproof cushion, comes with a four-leg or four-spoke metal base, ensuring flexibility across patios and terraces. Complementing this was Argo Libro Metal, a new mono-material folding table engineered entirely in metal. Featuring Mara’s patented folding mechanism, it neatly collapses for storage while remaining robust and weather-resistant—an evolution from the original Argo Libro used in conference rooms, now reimagined for outdoor dining and co-living spaces.The home-office collection reinforced Mara’s core philosophy: fusing function with finesse. Follow Desk, already known for its patented height adjustability, was revealed in an elegant monochrome finish, refining performance with visual clarity. The Elle system returned as a smart, modular solution for organizing and dividing spaces, while Icon, the armchair that began the collection, appeared fully upholstered with an ergonomic Synchro mechanism that supports dynamic movement throughout the workdayArgo Libro Metal, a mono-material, monochrome proposal also designed for an outdoor useIn hospitality settings, Mara turned versatility into an art form. Typo Soft and Typo Table joined forces to offer tactile comfort and resilient design, with Typo Table’s metal structure ready for indoor or alfresco use. Framing it all was the B302 bookcase, a minimalist modular system that allowed for endlessly repeatable compositions. By alternating solids and voids, it gave rhythm and architectural dimension to every environment.Across this entire offering, Mara reaffirmed its commitment to functional beauty—where design enhances how we live, work, and gather. The message is clear: every space deserves good design, and with Mara, that design is for all.close-up of the Argo Libro Metal table with Icon Outdoor armchairIcon Soft Metal by Marcello Ziliani, an evolution of the collection, is fully upholstered and equipped with conceived a new, thin metal base, available in a variety of colours, for an even more sophisticated comfortTypo Lounge Chair’s metal tube, worked and bent with precision, is transformed into a characterizing graphic featureElle, the bookcase system by Ferruccio Laviani, with its balance between lightness and architectural appeal, being configured so to enhance its versatile modularitythe Follow Desk and Tilting tables, defined by a patented mechanical height- adjustment system, presented in the new monochrome versionproject info:brand: Mara | @marasrl_officialproducts: Typo Lounge Chair \u0026 Ottoman, Foil \u0026 Foil Bench,Elle \u0026 Elle Consolle, Follow Meeting Cone Large, Icon Soft Metal, Icon Outdoor, Argo Libro Metal,Follow Desk and Tilting, Typo Soft and Typo Tabledesigners: AMDL CIRCLE (Michele de Lucchi); Christophe Pillet; Ferruccio Laviani; Marcello Zillianiphotography: ©Mara, ph.
