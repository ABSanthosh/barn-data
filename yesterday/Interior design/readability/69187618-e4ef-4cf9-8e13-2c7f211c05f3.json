  "text": "After more than a decade of anticipation, New York’s East River will soon host one of the city’s most intriguing public amenities: +POOL. This 9,000-square-foot floating pool isn’t just about fun; it’s a thoughtful blend of design, technology, and city life. The concept is simple yet ambitious—a plus-shaped pool that filters river water and creates four distinct swimming zones, each tailored for different experiences. Construction has finally begun, and New Yorkers are watching closely as the project prepares for its maiden season at Pier 35. The +POOL design doesn’t camouflage its purpose—a crisp, geometric outline floats just off the Lower East Side, accessible by a slim walkway. Inside, the water isn’t chlorinated or piped in from somewhere else. Instead, a multi-layered filtration system draws in water from the river, purifies it, and returns it to the flow when swimming is done. This makes the pool both a functional recreation spot and a public demonstration of clean water technology. For a city built on its waterways but often disconnected from them, the pool is a quietly radical choice. Designers: Dong-Ping Wong, Oana Stanescu, Archie Lee Coates IV \u0026 Jeffrey Franklin The +POOL includes four sections—a lap pool, lounge pool, kids’ pool, and sports pool – which invite all types of swimmers. The structure’s modularity means it can be configured for lessons, workouts, or just a cool dip on a humid summer day. The 9,000-square-foot footprint is generous but not overwhelming, and the pool’s floating nature allows it to navigate changing tides and city rhythms. Placed in the East River, it offers city dwellers a safe, inviting space to swim—something that’s been missing from Manhattan for generations. The technology driving +POOL sets it apart from typical urban pools. Its filtration system is chemical-free and engineered to meet rigorous health standards. The vessel, constructed at a Mississippi shipyard, will soon make its way north, ready for installation and testing. Once it’s docked and operational, the pool will process thousands of gallons of river water daily, ensuring swimmers experience clean, clear conditions. Public benefit is woven throughout the project’s DNA. For years, Friends of +POOL—the nonprofit force behind the idea—has hosted educational programs, floating art installations, and water quality workshops. The pool’s eventual opening represents more than a new place to swim. It’s a culmination of activism, design thinking, and civic collaboration. It also signals a shift in how New Yorkers might interact with their waterfront, reframing the city’s rivers as sites of possibility rather than barriers. Looking ahead, +POOL is poised to become a new urban icon. Its presence will be immediate and unmistakable, a visual reminder that design can bridge utility and delight. By inviting the public into the river, safely and beautifully, +POOL offers a new model for urban swimming and city engagement. As the project moves closer to opening day, it stands as proof to what’s possible when vision, engineering, and community meet at the water’s edge.",
