  "text": "If, like me, you live in a concrete jungle, having plants or anything green around you can be a challenge. I can go for months without seeing calming scenes of nature, which may contribute to constant stress and tension. Numerous studies have shown that looking at something green every few minutes helps rest our eyes and lift our spirits. Now, imagine a plant that doesn’t just sit on your shelf but actually helps you feel better, focus more, and even reminds you to take care of it. That’s exactly what Oasis, designed by Xiansen Wang, is all about. It’s not just a concept for a pretty plant pot—it’s a smart, interactive wellness companion that uses science and technology to boost your mood and help you relax. Designer: Xiansen Wang Oasis uses something called “multimodal emotional interaction,” which simply means it interacts with you through different senses—sight, smell, touch, and even a bit of sound—making the experience feel real and engaging. It features a modular, building block design, so you can mix and match different parts to create your ideal setup. The components are designed to work together, which reduces waste and lowers costs—a win for both you and the planet. For fragrance, Oasis offers five aromas with “healing powers.” Thyme eases negative emotions like tension, anger, and fatigue. Lemon Verbena lifts your energy. Lemongrass relieves anxiety, tension, and tiredness. Spearmint soothes panic, fatigue, and tension, while Mugwort calms you down when you’re tired. Oasis also uses a small camera to “read” your facial expressions. Using smart software, it figures out your mood in real time and can suggest ways to help you feel better, such as breathing exercises or reminders to take a break. This technology is powered by the ESP32-cam—a compact but powerful computer chip that also senses when you’re nearby and even detects if the plant needs water, just by you touching the leaves. Struggling to focus at work or school? Just place your phone on the Oasis “pebble” base and set a timer. Oasis will glow gently while you concentrate and remind you to take a break every hour with a soft flash of light. Worried about caring for your plant? No problem! Oasis checks the soil’s moisture with a sensor and notifies you when it’s time to water, so you’ll never forget. Oasis combines nature and technology in a way that’s easy for anyone to enjoy. It helps you feel better, stay focused, and makes plant care simple—even if you don’t have a green thumb!",
