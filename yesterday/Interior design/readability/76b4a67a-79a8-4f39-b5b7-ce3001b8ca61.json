  "description": "Architect Nick Sweetland believes in the generosity and potential of older brick apartments, so he purchased an original two-bedroom apartment in a solid 1960s Ivanhoe East building, with a $65,000 budget to make his own upgrades. What followed was a remarkable transformation over just four months, including a rebuild of the kitchen and bathroom, and removal of a central wall, to create a more comfortable and all-round beautiful space to inhabit. Nick shares how he did it, and reveals the final budget breakdown.",

  "text": "As an architect, Nick Sweetland has long dreamed of designing his own home. That opportunity finally came to fruition this year, when Nick purchased an apartment in a mid-rise brick Ivanhoe East building brimming with potential. ‘In every sharehouse I’ve lived in, I found myself mentally redesigning the space,’ says Nick. ‘Being able to finally realise something that feels both deeply personal and contextually grounded has been incredibly fulfilling.’ The apartment — which was in entirely original condition at the time of purchasing — was completely transformed by Nick on a four month timeline and $65,000 budget, thanks to his industry experience, and a whole lot of DIY. Nick reveals what he learned along the way, and the all-important budget breakdown. The bones and vision Nick purchased his particular Ivanhoe East apartment for its location, proportions, and two balconies. ‘What drew me in were the bones: two balconies — one facing north and one south — with great potential for natural light and cross ventilation,’ he says. ‘I decided to renovate because I wanted to live here and because I strongly believe in reuse over new buildings. After months of searching, I fell for the generosity of older brick apartments. They’re solid, well-proportioned, and built to last in a way that many contemporary developments aren’t.’ Nick’s goal was to honour the ‘mid-century language’ of the 1960s apartment, and reflect the architectural character of Ivanhoe East. ‘I kept materials, colours, and furniture true to that lineage,’ he explains. ‘But more than a stylistic reference, my approach was rooted in the concept of adaptive reuse — rethinking and transforming existing buildings in a way that celebrates their original character while enhancing liveability.’ Scope of works The all-original apartment required significant renovations — both structural and cosmetic — to achieve Nick’s vision. ‘There was a lot of charm, but it was definitely showing its age… Almost everything was stripped back to bare bones and rebuilt,’ he says. ‘The kitchen joinery was solid hardwood (which made it hard to let go of!), but it wasn’t practical, and a wall between the kitchen and living area completely disrupted the spatial flow.’ Removing this central wall became the biggest element of the renovation, working to open up the apartment, maximise natural light, and outdoor connections. Nick says, ‘Opening up the living areas wasn’t just about aesthetics, it dramatically improved the environmental performance of the apartment. ‘In cooler months, the open plan allows for deeper solar penetration and passive heating. In summer, opening both balconies encourages natural cross ventilation, while deep eaves help reduce solar gain… ‘It required a fair amount of work: new ceilings, new structural support and rethinking how the spaces would flow together.’ Nick also reconfigured the bathroom before its cosmetic overhaul. ‘Originally, the washing machine sat awkwardly in the centre of the room. I sourced a slimline washer and tucked it under the vanity, which freed up space and made the room feel more resolved,’ he says. The overall scope of works also included: Removing all original joinery in the kitchen, bathroom, and living area Replacing the cast iron bathtub with a walk-in shower Removing and replacing all lighting Replacing old carpet and vinyl flooring with engineered oak floorboards Removing all skirting boards and installing new profiles Replacing the terrazzo bathroom tiles Painting the entire apartment Installing a new custom bathroom vanity DIY and a tight deadline Nick gave himself an initial budget of $60,000 (which blew out slightly to $65,000) and a timeline of just four months to renovate the apartment around his full-time job. To make it happen, Nick leaned on his industry experience, including previous work as a builder’s labourer. ‘That mix of site experience and design training made a huge difference when it came to my own renovation. I tackled everything from demolition and plastering to skirting boards, painting, and installing shelving and benchtops.’ Nick also project managed the build, and engaged builder Tom Duffy among other trades for the bigger tasks such as plumbing, tiling, electrical, flooring, and cabinetry. Nick says he couldn’t have done it without his handy parents, Kim and Mike, who helped make the tight deadline possible. ‘Doing most of the work myself brought the cost down significantly, but I absolutely underestimated the time commitment. With full-time work, the only time to chip away at it was before work, after work, and weekends. ‘It took a lot mentally and physically to finish everything within four months. And prep work, like chasing brickwork or painting properly, always took longer than expected,’ says Nick. ‘Doing so much DIY was physically exhausting, but it also gave me a deeper connection to the space.’ Project wins and lessons learned Nick kept costs down by searching for secondhand materials where possible, including Fibonacci terrazzo bathroom tiles found on Facebook Marketplace. ‘Someone had leftovers from their own reno, and I managed to scoop them up!’ says Nick. ‘Paying full price would have completely blown the budget, so that find saved me a heap and aligned perfectly with the project’s ethos of reuse.’ Some of his favourite features of the apartment are handmade, adding a layer of sentimentality to the project. ‘The floating stainless steel kitchen shelves are probably my favourite design element — they’re simple, functional, and feel very resolved. They play beautifully against the timber joinery and handmade tiles,’ says Nick. ‘It was a big win being able to design and install them myself.’ Budget breakdown Trades Cabinetry (kitchen \u0026 bathroom): $12,500 Timber flooring (including installation): $8500 Plumber: $8450 Electrician: $4850 Builder: $4770 Tiling (kitchen \u0026 bathroom): $3800 Caulking: $600 Total: $43,470 DIY Building materials/tools: $6650 Paint (whole house): $1500 Skirting boards: $360 Total: $8510 Kitchen Integrated appliances (rangehood, dishwasher, fridge, cooktop, oven, microwave): $3200 Stainless steel benchtop + integrated sink: $3000 Stainless steel overhead shelving: $1950 Splashback tiles: $375 Tapware: $320 Handles: $180 Total: $9025 Bathroom Shower tiles: $1000 Toilet: $630 Granite benchtop + splashback: $500 Washing machine: $500 Shower tapware: $485 Terrazzo floor tiles: $280 Sink: $275 Vanity tapware: $185 Hooks/rack: $140 Total: $3995 Renovation total: $65,000",
