Using a draft stopper will help save money on your heating bills during the winter months. If you can’t find a ready-made draft stopper to coordinate with your decor, do what I did, cover a store bought draft stopper with fabric so it will also add cheery color that fits your home decorating style. If you live in a southern climate, then you probably don’t need to find ways to dodge the chill of winter from seeping through your doors and windows. But if you live anywhere where it gets cold in the winter or in an old house or one that is not sealed properly, you are going to feel a draft when the outside temperature drops. What Is a Draft Stopper or Draft Dodger? I first learned what a draft dodger, door snake or draft stopper was when I was in college living in an old dormitory with very drafty windows. My roommate and I used to roll towels into a tube shape and place them along the sill of the windows. It wasn’t perfect, but it helped keep the chill out of our room. Then upon returning from home one weekend, my roommate brought a ready-made fabric filled tube in a box labeled “Draft Dodger“. Genius!!!! It was made with corduroy fabric and filled with rice. It was specially made for one purpose only and that was to block the gap between the bottom of a door or window and the sill preventing cold air from entering a room and warm air from escaping. Since then I have always had one or two draft dodgers at the ready in my home to place by a door or window in the winter. Why You Should Consider Using a Door Draft Stopper Incorporating draft dodgers into a home will help prevent warm air from escaping and get rid of cold spots near doors and windows, creating a more comfortable living space.  Draft dodgers not only keep the drafts out, but can also become a decorative element, adding a personalized touch to any room. An added benefit is their ability to minimize sound transmission through gaps, providing a quieter indoor space. For vertical gaps around doors and windows the most effective and simple way to keep the winter drafts away is adding stick-on weatherstripping. See more on this at the end of the post. A Few Ways to Make a Draft Dodger for Doors and Windows A draft stopper can be made in a variety of ways – sewn, no sew and also by repurposing items you already own. How to Make a Colorful Cover for an Existing Door Draft Stopper Many ready-made draft dodgers are made using neutral colors, but if you would like a more decorative one to coordinate with your room’s decor, here are a few easy ideas to make one yourself. supplies needed: Draft stopper – I found mine at a local store in the bargain basement – see list of places to buy one below Fabric yardage Thread to match Yarn Cardboard Scissors 1.  Measure the length and width of draft stopper. Cut 2 pieces of fabric to those measurements and add about an inch all around for seam allowance. Lay the fabric right sides together on work surface and pin one short side and two long sides together. Sew together on a sewing machine. Remove pins, turn right side out. Place draft stopper inside. Sew open end together by machine or hand. Hot glue or hand stitch a pom-pom to each corner. Place in front of door. How to Make a No-Sew Door Draft Dodger When making your own door draft stopper you don’t even need fabric yardage. One can be quickly made by cutting off a leg from an old pair of jeans or an arm from a sweater to the width of your door or window and fill with rice or other fillers (See more below). Close cuts ends by sewing by hand or tie off ends securely with ribbon or string. You can even use fabric glue to close the ends. What to Fill a Draft Stopper With Rice – Fits easily into gaps and provides good weight. Dried beans, peas or buckwheat – Offer similar benefits to rice. Kitty litter – Inexpensive and absorbs moisture. Sand – Provides the right weight but can be messy if the fabric cover opens or gets ripped. How To Add Weather Stripping to a Door or Window If your doors or windows have gaps along the vertical sides, adding weatherstripping is a cost-effective way along with a draft dodger to keep the cold air from getting in. There are many types of weatherstripping sold at most home improvement stores from caulks to self adhesive foam and rubber styles. When I needed to seal a door to my deck, I wanted to use something that would look good. I found EPDM Rubber Self-Sticking Weatherseal tape. It is made of rubber and has adhesive on it already. I had it around the door jam in less than 5 minutes. Caulk can also be used around drafty doors and windows, but can look messy. The rolled foam or vinyl types of weatherstripping with adhesive backings are also easy to use. To Apply Self Adhesive Weatherstripping: Simply measure around the door jam and cut a piece of the tape to that measurement. Remove paper backing and press right up against the door jam or into the door jam if the gap is large. No handyman or contractor needed. Draft dodgers are a simple yet effective solution for improving home comfort and energy efficiency. Whether you cover one you already own with a new fabric or make a no-sew one from the leg of jeans these easy-to-make draft stoppers offer both a decorative and practical way to keep cold drafts at bay and reduce heating costs.  If you would like to find out more ways to winterize your home, check out the tips from Home Depot.
