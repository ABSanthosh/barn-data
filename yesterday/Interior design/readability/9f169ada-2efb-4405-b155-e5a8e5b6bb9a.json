In past years I have put up two artificial trees from another brand in the house. The main one in my living room that I decorate with garlands and ornaments and a smaller one in the foyer that I leave bare with only lights. Last year I had a request from my husband, Ed, to put a tree in the bedroom where his desk/office area is so he could feel the Christmas spirit when he is at work during the weekdays. So I went to the King of Christmas website and chose a tree. They carry so many different types and sizes of trees – lit, unlit, and flocked tree styles. 7-foot King Noble Fir – Lit Ed will no longer feel “twinkling Christmas tree deprived” as I chose a pre-lit King of Christmas 7 foot King Noble Fir. Its minimal look is perfect for the empty corner in the bedroom near his desk. The tree has such realistic branches and my favorite part…500 warm white LED lights that have 8 light modes, including slow twinkle mode. :-) What’s Comes With the Christmas Tree Tree Stand 3 Tree Sections Pre-lit with 500 warm LED lights Protective Fluffing Gloves On/Off Foot Pedal Remote to turn lights on and off, place on a timer and change the lighting modes Instruction Manuals Zippered storage bag to conveniently pack away and transport the tree when not in use with ease. Having a storage bag with handles is great to have, but what I also loved was the “fluffing gloves”. Fluffing is the term for opening up and spreading out the tree branches. When you first take the tree out of the box or storage bag, the branches might be a little smushed and need to be re-shaped or fluffed. When I fluffed my tree, I did it after adding a section at a time. This makes it easier without having the next section of branches get in the way. The branches are hinged, so in storage they are pointing up. As you fluff the tree, you can pull each branch down into its proper position. Very easy. Tree Fluffing Gloves If you have ever decorated a Christmas tree you know that the branches can irritate and scratch your skin on your hands and arms. When I worked in retail display I wore gloves like the ones that come with the tree to protect my hands when lighting and decorating dozens of Christmas trees every year. Easy Set-Up Right out of the box the tree was easy to assemble, allowing me to focus on the joy of decorating it rather than trying to understand any complicated instructions and electrical light connections that had to happen to get the tree to light. The tree has three sections marked A, B, and C with the bottom section being the largest, but still easy to place into the tree stand. What I love most about the trees that King of Christmas makes is that the power runs through the center pole (trunk)that each section goes into, no more bother having to connect plugs together from the various sections as I have to do with my other trees. The lighting of the tree was all automatic with what is called Power Pole technology. All I had to do was pop the sections into the pole and it was done. No more having to search through the tree to find the right connectors to light the tree. This feature alone is a game changer. Warm White LED Tree Lights There are 500 warm LED’s on the this 7 foot tree that give it the perfect glow when lit. 7′ Noble Fir With Lights Off If you are a long time reader of my blog you know how much I like my Christmas trees to have soft twinkle lights. 7′ Noble Fir With Lights On In the past I have had to add them myself to my already pre-lit trees so they would twinkle. With this King of Christmas tree, I don’t have to do that as there are 8 lighting modes and a timer that you can change with the touch of a button on the included remote. Not only can you choose different settings for the lights, but you can also brighten and dim them, or put them on an 8-hour timer using the remote. You can also change the lighting modes with a touch of the foot pedal that is connected to the electrical cord that goes to a wall outlet. King of Christmas LED lights also have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours. Plus, if one bulb goes out, the rest of the strand will still remain lit! Decorating My Tree When thinking about how I was going to decorate the tree, I decided to keep it simple and coordinate it with the blue and white color scheme in the bedroom. Since the tree is for Ed, I went with a more masculine look using plaid flannel fabric yardage as a tree skirt and snowball garland that I bought. To make the tree skirt I did what my mom always did, she simply wrapped about 2 – 2-1/2 yards of fabric around the tree stand, then arranged it into soft folds. I also added another style of snowball garland that I made when I first started blogging. You can read all about how to make it here: Snowball and Beaded Garland. The Perfect Minimalistic Christmas Tree I absolutely LOVE my new King of Christmas’ 7′ King Noble Fir’s simple silhouette. This tree has a minimalistic design that will complement any style of ornament you have. Whether you’re into traditional or more modern designs, the Noble Fir is the perfect backdrop. Plus, the tree’s realistic and full branches provide ample space to hang all of your favorite ornaments. Everything about this tree lives up to its promise of simplicity – a game-changer for stress-free holiday decorating!
