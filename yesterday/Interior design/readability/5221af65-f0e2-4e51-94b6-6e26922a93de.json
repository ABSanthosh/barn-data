  "text": "Tranquility and modern design flow seamlessly in the Driftwood Apartment—designed by Mariya Chmut. This space is inspired by nature’s raw beauty as well as coastal design elements. It celebrates the art of minimalism with warm wood tones. This is complemented by sleek marble accents and ethereal lighting. Every detail—from the textured finishes to the earthy palette—creates a harmonious space that feels grounded yet luxurious. The Driftwood Apartment is designed to evoke a sense of calm, transforming your everyday living into an effortless escape. The living room is an affair of beige and brown. Dark wooden flooring is topped with a velvet rug that adds opulence. A large, spacious sectional makes sure there’s room to sprawl out while bingewatching your favorite show even if square footage is at a premium. An organically shaped mirror near the window reflects light throughout the room, making it feel bigger and more well-lit. Simultaneously, the c-shaped table offers functionality similar to a coffee table while occupying so much less space. Driftwood Apartment’s kitchen sticks to a neutral palette. The design secret is the unique marble veining—seen in the island as well as the backsplash. The beige cabinetry is sleek and without hardware. Into this, we see essential appliances seamlessly blending in. Over the island, a rod light makes sure to provide illumination. A bulky oakwood table and sleek chairs provide room for you to dine with loved ones. A ceramic vase and sculptural lighting come together to form a design statement in the space, as does the perfectly round mirror on the wall. The large floor-to-ceiling windows are paired with minimal drapery so the dining area receives natural light all day long. We love the use of beige in the bedroom. Visual interest is added with contrasting lines. That is, the horizontal lining on the velvet bed upholstery and the vertical lines right behind it. A unique black reading light makes sure you can receive targeted light as you read your favorite book before bed. Even in the compact space, a small walk-in closet gives that ultimate luxurious experience! In the bathroom, differently patterned tiles add a punch of interest. These continue all the way to the ceiling, making the bathroom feel tall and luxurious. A back-lit vanity makes sure you get the perfect spot for makeup sessions, while the mini sink and integrated bathtub provide optimal functionality. There’s also a shower cubicle with a glass partition. A quick shower or relaxing soak? You decide.",
