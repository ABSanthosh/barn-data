  "text": "Meeting the makersIts lighting pieces – from pendant, table and floor lamps, to chandeliers and tealights, created in collaboration with impresario designers as lauded as Arik Levy, Noé Duchaufour-Lawrance, Elise Fouin, Emmanuel Gallina and countless other luminaries – merge geometric and organic shapes to winsome and poetic effect, in robustly tactile and delicate forms.It’s an approach explored in brilliant clarity with a new collection by the German-born and Holland-based Jette Scheib, dubbed LYS. As with her previous series for Forestier – Cymbal, Oyster, Grass and Parrot – Scheib’s undulating designs are directly inspired by vegetation and, in this case, the royal lily flower.‘I wanted this flower, steeped in positive symbolism, to become a luminous, sculptural centrepiece’‘This remarkable flower, cherished across centuries and continents, radiates beauty and significance,’ explains Scheib. ‘Different lily colours carry distinct meanings, symbolising purity, love, eternity, hope and celebration, making it a perfect muse. I wanted this flower, steeped in positive symbolism, to become a luminous, sculptural centrepiece.’The LYS collection reflects the elegant petals of the royal lily, with lampshades in three sizes, available in natural wood veneer or a striking dark black finish",
