  "text": "Not all homes follow the conventional blueprint. This Kazakhstan apartment is proof that unusual room shapes can be both visually striking and functional. We see bold geometric forms and fluid transitions bringing even the most awkward corners to life. This space sure challenges the norms of traditional interior design, and we’re here for it! This is by far the most compact and awkwardly positioned living room we’ve seen. But it also happens to be one of the most cleverly designed! The long and low-profile sectional sofa is positioned against the wall. This makes the most of the room’s elongated shape. The TV is wall-mounted with a sleek floating console below, which reduces bulk. We also love how the console extends along the wall. This anchors the space together. We’d also like to mention the light color palette, which enhances the feeling of openness, and the large window, which brightens up the space. The single-wall kitchen design makes sure residents can seamlessly move between the living area and hallway. There’s a long countertop, so the functionality is at its maximum. We especially love the wooden tones adding warmth through the cabinetry. The rest of the kitchen uses a neutral palette and tiled walls. In the dining area, a wooden pedestal table makes for a space-savvy choice. This is paired with Cesca chairs, which feature a cantilevered chrome frame and woven cane seat. The black beechwood detailing adds visual interest. A narrow transitional zone makes good use of space by housing a litter box. So the pets can have their own tiny spot. The entryway in the Kazakhstan Apartment has awkward angles, but the strategic lighting makes things feel much better. There’s also sleek cabinetry to keep essentials. The bedroom is simple and functional. A soft upholstered bed is paired with a vintage rug, all using neutral tones. A compact desk provides room for work, while flowerpot lamps sprinkled around the space make for a stunning design choice. There’s also a ring light catering to the homeowner’s needs. The drapery is light—so sunshine can illuminate the space. This is also reflected by the large curved floor mirror. The bathroom is no less than a design statement! A checkered black and white floor sets the perfect base. The wooden vanity is compact. Yet, the vessel sink adds luxury. A tiled shower cubicle is segregated with a glass partition. The use of glass here makes sure the small space doesn’t feel cramped.",
