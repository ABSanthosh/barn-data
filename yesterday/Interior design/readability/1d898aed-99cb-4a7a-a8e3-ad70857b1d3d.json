  "text": "Interior designer Gala Magriñá studied film and television at New York University, and after graduation she wanted a job that would allow her to continue to make movies to submit to festivals. She accepted a position with Italian clothing brand Diesel creating window and in-store displays. Magriñá eventually opened her own production agency and orchestrated events for a roster of high-profile companies like Jimmy Choo and Harper’s Bazaar. Along the way she discovered Vedic meditation, which not only captured her interest, but also shaped her vision for interiors. “It was a game-changer, helping me reconnect with my purpose and rethink the impact I wanted to make in the work,” Magriñá says. “My passion for mindfulness led me to shift my focus from creating temporary spaces to creating permanent interiors, and that’s when my mission came into focus.” Gala Magriñá Magriñá was ready for her next venture, and so in 2018 she launched her eponymous firm. Based in Westchester, New York and women-led, the team’s commercial and residential projects can be found in every corner of the globe. Magriñá strives to merge the cool and beautiful with the holistic and mindful. By deftly balancing a range of elements, each of her spaces inspire and elevate the energy of the individuals who inhabit them. The designer considers herself fortunate to have mentors who offer support and guidance. She counts many interior designers as friends, and she’ll often strategize with them or bounce ideas around and get their feedback, which enhances her own process. Even with a busy schedule, Magriñá always makes time to go within and center herself. “When I find my energy waning around 3 pm, I will stop working and meditate,” she notes. “It helps me reset and get ready for the evening.” Today, Gala Magriñá joins us for Friday Five! Photo: Gala Magriñá 1. Travel Travel is my greatest source of inspiration. I’ve been fortunate enough to explore quite a handful of different places, and I come back inspired and changed in some way. Some of my favorite cities to visit have been Rishikesh in India, Hong Kong, Dubai, and Tokyo because the cultures were so different from what I am used to. I find that any time we can step outside our routines to expose ourselves to new experiences broadens our perspectives in a way that staying home just can’t. When I go to a new city I like to make a list of museums, stores, hotels, and restaurants to visit and plan walkable routes to see all of them. Along the way I let myself get lost on different streets which has led me to find some of the best spots! I love this balance of planning a bit while allowing some mixed-in spontaneity. This combo has never failed me. Photo: Gala Magriñá 2. Art + Objects Another way I stay inspired is by going to art and design fairs. I live in NYC where we’re lucky to have quite a few locally, but I also love Basel and Design Miami. These are some of my favorite days. I typically take the day off work, go with interior design friends/peers, and then we go to a fabulous lunch somewhere. While I’m there, I take tons of photos that I meticulously file away as inspiration for future projects. When you’re busy it’s easy to keep your head down and keep grinding, but as a creative, it’s important to take days off to find inspiration and share some good laughs with friends. Photo: Gala Magriñá 3. Interior Architectural + Design Details I am constantly observing how things have been built or designed, capturing photos wherever I go. When I’m traveling with family, while they’re busy taking photos of monuments or of the group, I’m snapping shots of door knobs and moldings and asking them to move out of the frame! I am particularly drawn to European design, and get tons of inspiration while there. I find they do really simple, yet modern and cool things, and love bringing some of those elements into my projects when I return to the States. Photo: Gala Magriñá 4. Nature Another magnificent source of inspiration and awe for me is nature. I try and take a walk outside in the park every day, no matter the weather. I find that walking in nature and just observing brings me peace of mind, and a lot of the time, some of my best ideas. The grandeur and perfection of nature always humbles me and makes all my problems seem small. So, immersing myself in nature is essential for my well-being and inner peace. Photo: Gala Magriñá 5. NYC Last but not least is my hometown of NYC. I’ve lived here since I was eight and every time I step foot in the city I am inspired all over again. From the people, the fashion, and the pulse of the city, it all sparks my creativity. Some of my best ideas come to me while I am walking from place to place with my headphones in and music on. Turning the corner and seeing the Chrysler building bathed in sunlight never ceases to amaze and inspire me. I once got the chance to ask the performance artist Marina Abramovic why she loved living in NYC and she said: “The energy. Manhattan is built on bedrock which just shoots the energy right back up at you”. I wholeheartedly agree and feel it every time I step into the city. Works by Gala Magriñá Design: Design Studio Office in Long Island City Gala Magriñá Design conceptualized a new 4,000-square-foot headquarters office for creative agency DesignStudio in Long Island City, New York that seamlessly marries the brand’s identity with the culture of their new home in New York City. Mid-century modern design meets industrial modern flair with curated spaces for everything from hybrid meeting rooms conducive to Zoom calls, a laid-back all-hands meeting space, and areas for collaborative brainstorming or single-task focused work. Both highly functional and beautiful, the office is truly made for the way that people work in a post-COVID world, where a meeting of creative minds can come to convene, work and play. Irvington, NY Residence This project was the ultimate design challenge – infusing a 6,100-square-foot colonial-style home from 1929 with our signature style of eclectic modern pop with minimal construction. Gala Magriñá Design honored the original architectural details and by painting the rooms a soothing off-white, it provided us with a blank canvas to work with.We included pops of complimentary color with furniture and brought in personality and style via abstract art and meticulously curated objects and accessories. West 67th Street Apartment A two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment with sweeping views of the New York City skyline and Central Park in need of a major overhaul. Gala Magriñá Design did a full remodel of the apartment choosing soft tones, natural woods, and a variety of textures to create some major “sanctuary” vibes throughout and let NYC be the star of the show. Magriñá chose a dark blue grasscloth wallpaper for the primary bedroom that adds depth and texture to an otherwise airy and ethereal room. Light woods paired with carrara marble give the room a warm, elegant feel. Plenty of plants introduce a dose of nature much needed for urban environments. In the guest bedroom, biomorphic shapes introduce other touches of nature to the space via wallpaper and a curved headboard for a fun and unexpected twist. Postlight 5th Avenue Office Postlight approached Gala Magriñá Design to reimagine its 4,700-square-foot 5th Avenue office post-pandemic with a unique idea: create a Soho House-inspired space for both employees and clients. They wanted a space that was conducive to holding workshops, meetings and events for clients and the public as well as an inspirational workspace for their employees. Magriñá responded with curated lounge areas – some conducive to group meetings and some for individual-focused work. Custom wallpaper inspired by the brand colors and logo as well as custom art reflect the company’s mission and values. A 24’ TV and logo wall for speakers to present from also serves as a presentation space as well as a great photo moment. Each meeting and conference room was assigned a color that we created a tone-on-tone room out of with matching paint and custom area rugs. The kitchen was designed to host events with a massive island and plenty of space around it for guests to mingle at all while respecting the original old school NewYork style architecture. Holding that no office space is complete without an Instagrammable moment, Magriñá created a photo-worthy reception with plants, bright pops of color and neon. Yousician NYC Office Yousician approached Gala Magriñá Design to design its first U.S. Office in NYC. Housed in a beautifully renovated loft-style building in the Meatpacking district, Magriñá brought the brand to life while honoring the existing architecture. The company’s signature green is incorporated in tone-on-tone rooms and used as a base color to coordinate pops of colors with. In lieu of an additional meeting room, one of the closed spaces was converted into a music-inspired hangout room complete with a bar and record player. The approach takes the concept of “Resimercial” to another level, allowing for a more fun and informal setting for team and client meetings. A communal table in the open office area creates yet another work and meeting destination for clients and employees alike and ensures there are plenty of different spaces to work and collaborate.

Light woods paired with carrara marble give the room a warm, elegant feel. Plenty of plants introduce a dose of nature much needed for urban environments. In the guest bedroom, biomorphic shapes introduce other touches of nature to the space via wallpaper and a curved headboard for a fun and unexpected twist. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://galamagrinadesign.com/projects/commercial/postlight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePostlight 5th Avenue Office\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cem\u003ePostlight approached Gala Magriñá Design to reimagine its 4,700-square-foot 5th Avenue office post-pandemic with a unique idea: create a Soho House-inspired space for both employees and clients.

Each meeting and conference room was assigned a color that we created a tone-on-tone room out of with matching paint and custom area rugs. The kitchen was designed to host events with a massive island and plenty of space around it for guests to mingle at all while respecting the original old school NewYork style architecture. Holding that no office space is complete without an Instagrammable moment, Magriñá created a photo-worthy reception with plants, bright pops of color and neon.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://galamagrinadesign.com/projects/commercial/yousician/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYousician NYC Office\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eYousician approached Gala Magriñá Design to design its first U.S. Office in NYC.

The approach takes the concept of “Resimercial” to another level, allowing for a more fun and informal setting for team and client meetings. A communal table in the open office area creates yet another work and meeting destination for clients and employees alike and ensures there are plenty of different spaces to work and collaborate.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                        \n                                                    \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                    \u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/07/Anna-Zappia-Headshot-1-100x100.jpg\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/07/Anna-Zappia-Headshot-1.jpg 2x\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" alt=\"\"/\u003e                                    \u003c/p\u003e\n                                \u003c/div\u003e\n\n                                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                    \u003cp\u003eAnna Zappia is a New York City-based writer and editor with a passion for textiles, and she can often be found at a fashion exhibit or shopping for more books.
