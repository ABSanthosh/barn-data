  "text": "Nik Bentel Studio handcrafts sculptural Loopy ChairThe Loopy Chair by Nik Bentel Studio is a sculptural seating object that transforms the energy of a spontaneous, childlike sketch into a fully functional chair. At first glance, it feels like a cartoon brought to life — a single, looping line frozen mid-doodle. But behind its playful exterior lies a carefully engineered object, produced using high-quality materials and precise fabrication techniques. The project began in 2019 with the release of the original Loopy Chair: a single-color, thinner version that quickly captured attention for its whimsical form and bold silhouette. Now, several years later, the studio revisits and refines the concept, thickening the frame, upgrading the materials, and introducing a full spectrum of vibrant colorways including yellow, black, white, red, green, and blue. Each chair is handcrafted from a continuous tubular frame. The outdoor version is made of powder-coated steel, while the indoor versions include high-gloss fiberglass or a plush cloth-wrapped foam for extra comfort.all images courtesy of Nik Bentel Studioa continuous tubular frame shapes Loopy ChairThe form is the same across versions of the Loopy Chair — a three-dimensional sketch with no clear beginning or end — but the material choice shifts the tone from sturdy and architectural to light and tactile. To further bring the design’s world to life, Nik Bentel Studio’s team staged a whimsical photoshoot using miniature chair models and a surreal grassy landscape built inside their studio. The result captures the same sense of curiosity and delight that defines the chair itself, like flipping through a sketchbook that suddenly becomes reality. Debuting at ICFF 2025 in New York City, The Loopy Chair continues the studio’s tradition of creating limited-edition objects that blend art, performance, and design. True to its ethos, the chair is released in a small batch, with no restocks — a collectible moment frozen in line, loop, and color.a sketch turned seat — Loopy Chair brings a line doodle into 3D forma single looping line becomes a sculptural object for sittingbold curves and clean lines are engineered from a continuous tubular framepowder-coated steel ensures durability",
