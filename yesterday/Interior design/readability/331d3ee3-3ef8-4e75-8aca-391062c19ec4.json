  "description": "The owners of this Perth family home lived there for about a decade before embarking on a renovation. This meant they’d already fallen in love with the ‘old soul’ of the California bungalow, and had a clear vision for improving the floorplan’s functionality. With help from designers Studio Atelier, the extended house is now a perfectly personal sanctuary, designed to champion leafy gardens and the various stages of family life.",

  "text": "‘When we first visited the clients in their existing home, we were drawn to the way they had curated a space that showed off who they were as individuals,’ Studio Atelier creative director Kimberley Swinyard says. The 1935 California bungalow featured local art on the walls, kid’s drawings, mementos from their travels, and an impressive collection of indoor plants and ceramics — which had accumulated in the 10 years the owners had lived (and outgrown) the two-bedroom, one-bathroom house. The vision for the renovation was simple: to respect and retain the character of the old house, while opening up the traditional floorplan to reflect the way the family lived and entertained. A ‘forever home’ that could cater to the various seasons of life. ‘Affectionately named Warm Hearted House by the clients, the design for the project was crafted upon the idea of the feelings associated with being truly at home in a space,’ Kimberley says. ‘They wanted to bring in more natural light and greenery (being avid green thumbs) and also wanted the home to allow them to all be together in the same living space instead of being separated in different rooms.’ Wherever possible, the existing fabric of the house was retained or repurposed; with the existing bathroom and bedrooms being converted into the children’s wing; and the original living room now forming the owner’s main bedroom. A passageway at the rear of the home — a signature detail of Studio Atelier’s renovations — reveals the beginning of the new 90-square-metre extension, with a skylight overhead. Underfoot, the rich jarrah floorboards meet the contemporary burnished concrete floors of the open-plan living areas. These new spaces were carefully designed around an internal courtyard, ‘providing a breather between the old and new and the ability to appreciate both side by side,’ Kimberley says. ‘It features sculptural silvery banksia trees and the earthiness of Toodyay stone, and brings an abundance of natural light into the centre of the home. It’s a small space, which has such a big impact on the way the home functions and the rooms adjacent it.’ The resulting house feels like it’s enveloped in nature, with most spaces looking out to either the calming Annghi Tran-designed gardens, or the sweeping backyard with a deck for entertaining, and room for a playground. In line with the owners’ original styling, the interiors were also kept light, bright and simple, allow the family to make each room feel uniquely ‘them’. And it’s a backdrop that will remain timeless, even as their needs change year after year.",
