  "text": "Vans has an image of being classy, comfy, and desirable. Essentially a pair of sneakers that can make you look a little cooler than you actually are. While they are the go-to pair for surfers, skaters, and those who refuse to wear anything less cool; Vans have little association with adventure and hiking. But this greatest fusion of streetwear and adventure, envisioned by multidisciplinary designer Nicole McLaughlin, swings the brain to one side to reflect back and realign with what’s actually in front. Vans with a hiking turn! One so adventurously redefined that you get an entire backpacking setup built right onto your pair of Vans. And if you don’t disagree, it’s accompanied by a carry pouch and a pair of socks. All highlight the message of sustainability. Now how cool is that? Designer: Vans Vans and designer Nicole McLaughlin have an association going, which has reached its adventurous second wherein the latter has blended her eco-conscious approach with Vans Slip-On RS by placing a few miniature replicas of real-life objects on the shoe upper and sides giving the classic silhouette a playful and multipurpose kick. Vans x Nicole McLaughlin Slip-On RS is a demonstration of upcycling and sustainable fashion, which sits beside the designer previous wherein Nicole has transformed old volleyballs into slippers, camera bags into bralettes, and more. Now, this backpack on a shoe instead of steel toe is a choice inspired by the 1970s hiking packs and outdoor gear. Vans x Nicole McLaughlin “Rucksack” (moniker banded on the tongue) is an amalgamation of adventure and imaginative design approach. The Slip-On RS, which is the base of the customization, is more rugged than usual with a rucksack pocket in the toe. Adjustable nylon webbing runs along the shoe featuring a durable upper made using 40% recycled canvas with PFC-free waterproofing. On the side, hanging by the webbing is a climbing chalk bag and a miniature first aid box just clipped a few inches behind. A cargo pouch in the throat can be used to store a climbing rope, if you may. Of course, given its outdoorsy approach, the Vans x Nicole McLaughlin Slip-On RS is designed to withstand the elements. The waterproofed canvas for this is paired with a lugged tread pattern sole for durability and traction on different kinds of surfaces. This functional as it is fashionable Vans sneaker is going on sale starting February 26 through Nicole McLaughlin’s website. It will be available on the Vans official website in tan and gray colors from February 27. Dubbed Rucksock, the socks pair will be sold in solitary oatmeal color. Reportedly, the gray Vans x Nicole McLaughlin Slip-On RS is an online exclusive pair to buy.",
