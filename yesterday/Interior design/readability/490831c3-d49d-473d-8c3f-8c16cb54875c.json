  "text": "At the ongoing CES 2025, Sony has launched the prototype of an extended reality headset dubbed XYN specifically for creating 3D spatial content. The Japanese consumer Electronics giant briefly previewed their motive to develop the headset at last year’s CES and now the wearable has got better with 4K OLED microdisplays and video passthrough tech. XYN is a comprehensive software and hardware solution to support VR content creators to capture the precise details of the real-world environment and seamlessly integrate with an array of third-party tools for a flexible workflow. This makes complete sense as demand for mixed reality and virtual reality content is spiking. Making it easier for developers to create such content will push the whole wearable headset universe forward. Designer: Sony Creators can use the XYN in conjunction with Sony’s spatial content creation software to craft extended reality content including 3D objects, animations, and immersive games for Metaverse applications. When not in use the wearer can flip the headset up since they’ll be using it for long durations while creating content. The only thing missing this year compared to last year’s version is the pointer and ring on top. At the event, the headset was spotted in two colorways – black and gray. The price and release date of the headset are still uncertain, and we hope to hear more from Sony in the coming months. Alongside the XYN headset, Sony has also revealed the Xyn Motion Studio which is a Windows app with support for up to 12 Mocopi sensors for an improved motion capture flow. This is often used by video content creators to control virtual avatars courtesy of the wireless motion tracking system. The advanced software enables the developers to cut or merge motions, as well as toggle the time and position. A prototype of the spatial capture solution is now capable of converting any real objects or mirrorless camera photos into photorealistic 3D computer-generated assets. The software is slated to release in March 2025.",
