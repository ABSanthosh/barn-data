  "text": "The EU country might have the 5th strongest passport in the world, but they also have the most gorgeous passport now, with this new design unveiled by Geneva-based studio RETINAA. Passports are usually bureaucratic necessities—stamped, dog-eared, and mostly forgotten until the next border crossing. But leave it to the Swiss to turn theirs into a work of art. Designed by Geneva-based studio RETINAA, Switzerland’s next-generation passport transforms a travel document into an intricate, almost poetic celebration of the country’s identity. Switzerland has long been a champion of meticulous craftsmanship, whether in watchmaking, graphic design, or infrastructure. The new passport is no exception. RETINAA has woven the nation’s landscapes into the fabric of the document itself, using 3D-modeled reliefs that chart an imaginary journey from the Alpine peaks down to the valleys. Think of it as a cartographic love letter to Switzerland—each page unfolding like a travelogue through the country’s 26 cantons. And just when you think you’ve seen it all, ultraviolet light reveals hidden contour lines and architectural landmarks, turning the passport into a layered, interactive experience. Designer: RETINAA It’s a design that feels distinctly Swiss in its restraint and precision. Unlike passports that lean on flamboyant holograms or overtly nationalistic motifs, this one takes a more refined approach. The inner cover features a hydrological map, an elegant nod to Switzerland’s reputation as Europe’s “water tower.” With 1,500 lakes, countless rivers, and glaciers that supply six percent of Europe’s drinking water, Switzerland’s geography isn’t just picturesque—it’s essential. The passport embodies this reality, using water as a recurring theme to symbolize movement, connection, and continuity. Of course, design isn’t just about aesthetics—it’s also about function. A passport must be a fortress against counterfeiting, and RETINAA has seamlessly fused graphic art with security features that push the limits of modern printing technology. Intaglio printing, microtext, and UV-reactive inks are layered into the visuals, creating a document that’s nearly impossible to replicate. The effect is both subtle and striking—an object that looks like it belongs in a design museum but functions as one of the world’s most secure travel documents. Even the color palette plays a role. The traditional Swiss red cover remains, but inside, the pages shift through a gradient inspired by the country’s diverse landscapes. From the icy blues of glacial waters to the earthy tones of rolling hills, each hue reinforces the feeling of traversing through Switzerland itself. It’s a subtle yet powerful way of embedding national identity into something as utilitarian as a passport. I won’t lie, it made me look up eligibility for Swiss citizenship just so I could possess the document. One of the most innovative security features is the way the illustrations themselves interact with light. Under standard conditions, the passport looks like an elegant travel document, but under ultraviolet light, hidden details emerge—topographic layers, water currents, and architectural landmarks that subtly reinforce the themes of movement and identity. It’s a perfect blend of form and function, where the very elements that make the passport beautiful also make it exceptionally difficult to counterfeit. Most passports and banknotes employ this technology, but none as elegantly and artistically as the Swiss passport. This attention to detail isn’t surprising given Switzerland’s legacy in graphic design. The country pioneered the International Typographic Style—also known as Swiss Design—defined by its clean, grid-based compositions and functional approach to visual communication. That DNA is evident in this passport. Every element is intentional, from the typography to the placement of security features. Even the microtext, which might look like decorative detailing at first glance, serves both a security function and a storytelling purpose, incorporating references to Swiss history and geography. You have to give it to the Swiss for this surprising new achievement. Now, apart from the alps, chocolate, cheese, fondue, and impeccable watchmaking, there’s one more thing that Switzerland is undeniably good at – designing the most gorgeously secure travel documents humankind has ever seen!",
