  "description": "Decades ago, people would go to an ear-splitting rock concert with no thought of wearing earplugs.As awareness of hearing damage grew, it became common to see folks at concerts and music festivals wearing disposable earplugs. Those are typically made out of foam. Now GOB, a wellness products company whose motto is \"Made From Mother F@!cking Nature,\" is betting concertgoers would prefer a more sustainable earplug material. They've thus turned to mycelium foam, which is sort of like memory foam without the environmental drawbacks.\"Our aerial mycelium foam naturally dampens sound by evenly knocking down all frequencies, ensuring a balanced acoustic experience without distorting what you hear. Unlike traditional foam earplugs, which can muffle certain frequencies, our mycelium-based earplugs provide superior sound absorption while maintaining clarity and comfort.\" \"Designed for ultimate comfort, our earplugs mold to your ear like memory foam rather than expanding and pushing themselves out. They settle in snugly, adapting to your unique ear shape for a cozy, secure fit that stays in place without the discomfort of traditional earplugs.\" \"GOB's mycelium-based earplugs offer unparalleled comfort and protection without the guilt. Made entirely from lab-grown mycelium, they are 100% home-compostable and free from any harmful chemicals or additives—because what touches your body matters. Engineered for 12dB noise reduction while prioritizing the planet and your health, GOB earplugs are the world's first truly sustainable hearing solution.\" The product is called Core Pack, and they run $25 for a dozen pairs.",
