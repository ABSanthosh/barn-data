  "text": "This week, Google unveiled its first mass timber office building in Sunnyvale, California. It is designed to be a cutting-edge and eco-friendly building that will serve as a productive and conducive workspace for the employees. It was designed, keeping in mind the needs and requirements of the environment and employees. It is a five-story structure that will have 96% less carbon emissions than a traditional steel and concrete building of the same size. “This building, 1265 Borregas, showcases creating sustainable buildings that empower people to do their best work,” said Michelle Kaufmann, Google’s director of R+D for the Built Environment and the guiding force behind the creation of the new workspace in Sunnyvale’s Moffett Park district. Designer: Google As mentioned, it is the first building to be constructed from mass timber, which is a new type of engineered wood. Small pieces of wood are layered and laminated together to build large beams and walls. The office is designed to create an environment of collaboration, support, and focus. It is equipped with neighborhood spaces that will facilitate hybrid connections and interesting collaborations. It is a representation of Google’s priority to build nature-based or biophilic workplaces. According to research, people work best when surrounded by nature, and with this new workspace, Google is hoping to create a fresh and inspiring work environment. Timber is exposed inside and outside the office, which allows natural light to stream in while offering splendid views of the Northern California landscape. Automatic wooden blinds have been integrated, and they adapt to the sun’s position, minimizing glare. Mass timber is blessed with regenerative qualities, as it can absorb and store carbon over time. Hence, choosing mass timber was a sustainable and eco-friendly decision made by Google. It also reduces carbon emissions that are emitted from the extraction, production, and transportation of traditional building materials. Additionally, 100% of the structural mass timber lumber used to build 1265 Borregas was sourced from responsibly managed forests certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Around three acres of pollinator-friendly native plants, such as coast live oak, California wild rose, and common milkweed,d were planted at the site and its neighboring sites. This further encourages the creation of an office building and site that is sustainable and efficient. The widespread presence of greenery helps to improve employee wellbeing, ensuring they focus and work better.",
