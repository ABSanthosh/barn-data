  "text": "We’ve ported DOOM onto calculators, pregnancy tests, printers, and fridges because if it has a processor, it can run DOOM. But until now, there hasn’t been a way to embed that same chaotic devotion into the hardware we use to launch those ports. That’s where Drop’s new collab with DOOM: The Dark Ages hits just right – this time, we’re not modding to play DOOM. We’re equipping our keyboards for Hell. What you’re looking at are sculpted artifacts, shaped by NZ Caps to feel like they belong in a blood-soaked inventory screen. The craftsmanship lands somewhere between toyetic and sacred, pulling influence straight from the franchise’s newest armor-clad chapter. It’s a collector’s flex and a gamer’s dream – functional resin sculptures that turn your keeb into a demon-slaying altar. Whether you’re an old-school WAD wizard or riding the hype for Dark Ages’ launch, this drop demands attention. Designer: Drop + DOOM Start with the 1u Slayer’s Helmet. It’s as if the iconic visor and plated crown were miniaturized by a Cyberdemon with a shrinking ray. The detailing is absurd for something that takes up the real estate of a single key – each contour, vent, and battle scratch captured in resin like a relic excavated from your motherboard. The shape follows an SA R1 profile, which means it slots in beautifully on any top-row key, but let’s be honest – it’s going straight on Escape, where the Slayer belongs. Despite the size, the helmet has presence. It’s got that “last thing a Hell Priest sees” energy, amplified by the way its angular silhouette disrupts the smooth terrain of your board. It’s a visual focal point without being overbearing. Tap it once and you’ll feel that slight resistance unique to resin-cast artisans – solid, reassuring, like your keystroke just unlocked a secret corridor. This isn’t a gimmick. It’s usable, sculpted intimidation. And somehow, it doesn’t feel fragile. NZ Caps nailed the density so it holds up under regular use, assuming you don’t rage-slam your board mid-campaign. The 2.25u Flail and Shield cap, though, is a whole different beast. Bigger, bolder, and louder in both shape and metaphor, this one’s molded for the Enter key – a decision that feels poetic. It’s the cap you hit when you mean business. The flail is frozen mid-arc, sculpted with such tension that it almost hums with kinetic energy, while the shield acts as both a visual counterbalance and a protective charm. The SA Enter profile keeps the piece grounded despite its drama, with enough ergonomic curve to make daily use viable, though you might hesitate to press it just to preserve its beauty. What really sells it is how the form exaggerates intent. The flail’s spikes have depth, casting sharp shadows that change throughout the day like a sundial for violence. The shield feels ancient and brutalist, with edges that look forged by flame rather than 3D modeling. Together, they feel like a pair of miniature props from a game that prides itself on overkill. Both caps are handmade, with resin finishes that catch light in subtle ways and elevate them beyond simple fan merch. The 1u fits standard layouts perfectly, and the 2.25u finds a home on most TKL and full-size keyboards. Installation’s as easy as swapping in any MX-compatible key, and they’re priced at $59 a piece – steep, but absolutely in line with boutique artisan work. For fans who see their keyboard as more than just a tool, this set is a full-blown character build.",
