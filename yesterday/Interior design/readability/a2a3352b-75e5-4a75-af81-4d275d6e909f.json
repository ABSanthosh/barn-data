Since I get this question often (and I keep hanging more plates!) I thought I would share an update! I’ve tried various methods over the many decades I’ve been hanging plates on our walls, but the best way I’ve found to hang most plates and bowls are with these hangers. They are easy to apply and haven’t failed me yet! It’s important that you apply them according to directions and let the glue dry over night to make sure it’s secure. Click here for above sources Some of the reasons I like these hangers (besides how well they hold) are because they are mostly invisible and don’t damage the plates or the walls. I used to use wire plate hangers but they would make the plate stick out from the wall, the metal would often scratch the wall, the wire clamps showed around the perimeter and it would be easy to break a plate trying to make them fit. The way I apply these plate hangers, you can’t see them at all from the front. To make sure the plate or bowl lays flat on the wall, I apply the hanger on the disc like this below: Plate Hangers Sources: Rattan Cart // Floral Rug (color options) // More Sources I’ve always thought plates on a wall were so charming. I think of plates as affordable art because you can often find them inexpensively at secondhand or thrift stores. You can mix them with framed art, too. Even if you just have one decorative plate or bowl it will add interest and contrast to rectangular frames. Mix and match a variety of colors and patterns or even hang a whole set of plates and bowls to create a plate wall. It’s also a fun way to “use what you have” to decorate if you inherited a set of china you don’t need! Have you tried hanging plates on the wall? Pin this post for later ^",
