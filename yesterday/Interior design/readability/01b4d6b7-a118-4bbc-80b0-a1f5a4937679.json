  "text": "In the heart of Chelsea in New York City, a relatively unassuming charcoal gray facade conceals an immersive world of sound. House of Sound curates a listening experience that is next level, each subsequent floor of the building revealing somehow an even more complex sound system than the last. Each of the six floors house these systems from McIntosh Labs and Sonus faber in beautiful, considered spaces  – a pure treat for the ear and the eyes. I had the opportunity to visit House of Sound for a screening of A Complete Unknown, a biographical film starring Timotheé Chalamet as Bob Dylan, directed by James Mangold. Tod Maitland, sound designer for the movie, offered insight into the process behind the project before the film, sharing a behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to create a compelling and evocative score. Behind the foyer door, the luminous white of the entrance gives way to the darkness of a theater. Enormous charcoal lounges, easily big enough for four, dot the hushed, expectant room, dimmed lights throwing soft shadows onto the carpeted floor. Acoustic panels line the dark walls, ensuring you hear the score exactly as intended. Sound is so integral to worldbuilding, and coming from multiple different modalities, vocals, microphones, and instruments, ambient sound had to be expertly arranged in tandem with the soundtrack to create a cohesive film. Maitland shared the difficulties and also benefits from having Chalamet do all of his own vocals and most of his own guitar. This is quite unusual for an industry that is very much about the art, and also very much about the bottom line. Mics were hidden in his hair, guitar, and surrounding the stage to be eventually mastered into the final score. This added an incredible level of insight to the movie watching experience, understanding the intricacies of how to immerse a viewer. Sound is incredibly powerful. Dylan’s extensive catalogue has undoubtably changed folk music, and arguably the scope of music in general. Anyone who has been to a very good concert, perhaps one of his, knows this to be true. On the next floor, looking to the left of the landing, a gorgeous kitchen extends to the back of the building. The kitchen opens up into a two-story chandelier, with a chic patio right outside. The experience is immaculate, huge metal carafes of drinks on ice, beads of condensation extending to the twin gleaming granite countertops, creating the illusion of immense length. Pizza, Shake Shack, any type of beverage to choose from – a New York-themed night, coincidentally a personal favorite of mine. To the right of the landing, the McIntosh system here features a lossless projection, no one point in the room being the sweet spot to hear all the detail. Ambulating about, the volume and tonality do not change, offering an incredibly immersive sound experience. This was a treat to experience, the system blasting Donna Summer while not even breaking a sweat, coolly set at quarter volume. This is the magic of House of Sound: it’s a space for people who truly appreciate music to gather, and listen on some of the best and most complex systems in the business. All this, coupled with genuine hospitality and a first class interior, gives all the warmth of home, just more upscale. Taking great care to keep the space enjoyable and elevated, the House of Sound team does just that – an oasis of sound and sight all concealed cleverly from the bustle of the city. Completely decked out with a custom McIntosh system, the next level offers a pleasing vision of blue and brown, vintage cabinets and chestnut leather meet periwinkle upholstery and robin’s egg walls. Large, floor length windows offer light and perspective, the facade of the Maritime Hotel peeking out through the equipment. Lastly, we exit out on to the rooftop for a bit of fresh air. Chelsea landmarks spill over the skyline, with beautiful downtown views on all sides. Modern and luxurious, yet feeling right at home, this is exactly where you’d want to decompress after some intense listening. To learn more about House of Sound, visit houseofsoundnyc.com.
