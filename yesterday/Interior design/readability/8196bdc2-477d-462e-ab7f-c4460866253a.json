  "text": "Thanks for stopping by for this week’s Style Scouting. My Sunday post where I share the random stuff that captured my attention or inspired me that I found online. Hello… How are you? I hope you are enjoying the weekend. I had a good week this past week with the big projects that have taken up my brainspace for the last 6 months behind me now. I filled the week with getting the small “stuff” done that I have been putting off. Like touching up the paint that chipped on a heating vent, cleaning the dust bunnies that have accumulated under my bed and other smallish tasks around the house. I also enjoyed going through a stack of decorating and craft books I borrowed from the library – which is one of my favorite pastimes. Do you like to do this, too? I always enjoy finding and gathering the Style Scouting links to share with you every week and this week found two that I know my daughters will find a connection- like the kitchen above. It looks like my older daughter, Kelly’s kitchen. :-). And the other article my younger daughter, Mandy will like as she enjoys decorating with both her grandmother’s things. Hope you enjoy the links with your favorite hot beverage curled up in a cozy spot. Posts You May Have Missed This Week: Our ceiling contractors ghosted us!
