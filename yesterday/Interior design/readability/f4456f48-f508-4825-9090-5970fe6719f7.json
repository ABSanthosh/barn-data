Today, I want to dive deeper into the details of this makeover and the beautiful paint color that has completely revitalized this space. And if you are looking for a warm yellow paint color I hope you consider this one!A Fresh Coat of Hay No.37 by Farrow \u0026 BallChoosing the right paint color can be a game-changer for any room. For our mudroom, we wanted a warm yellow paint color that exuded warmth, tranquility, and a touch of timeless charm. Enter Hay No.37 by Farrow \u0026 Ball—a dusty yellow with subtle green undertones that offers an established, peaceful ambiance.Described beautifully by Farrow \u0026 Ball, this modest yellow, aptly named after the dried crop, is both warm and dusty. Less intense and sunny than the cleaner Yellow Ground, Hay No.37 has a distinctly green undertone, giving it a refined and established feel. It’s particularly stunning when contrasted with muted Lime White woodwork.Transforming the Mudroom: A Cozy RetreatOur mudroom has always been a functional space—a catch-all for coats, boots, and the occasional muddy paw print. However, I envisioned it as more than just a pass-through area. By applying Hay No.37 to the walls, the room instantly transformed into a cozy retreat that warmly welcomes us home each day.The green undertones in this paint beautifully complement our existing décor, adding depth and character without overwhelming the senses. The canvas of Hay No.37 really makes the wood tones and seasonal decor pop, creating a cohesive, inviting, and perfectly cozy space.Our Paint Color DecisionIt is no secret the price of Farrow and Ball is a major issue for many people. We’ve used both genuine Farrow and Ball paint and color-matched versions, and while I do believe the price could be justified due to the quality, this particular room was color-matched in Benjamin Moore Scuff-X Semi-Gloss.Final ThoughtsUpdating our mudroom with Hay No.37 has been an absolute joy. This color brings warmth, serenity, and a new layer of coziness, transforming what was once purely functional into a cherished, comforting corner of our home. This room keeps us smiling; it feels like a sunny retreat, even on the dark and gloomy winter days here in Michigan. Thank you so much for stopping by the blog today and every other day. Keep up with us daily here.xxLizMarie",
