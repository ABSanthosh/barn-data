With the versatile furniture from Brunner, comfortable and exclusive atmospheres can be created in hotel, hospitality and event areas, tailored to individual concepts.Hotel Öschberghof. Photo: Stefan MarquardtFor nearly 100 years, psychology has explored the extent to which the design of rooms influences people’s emotions and behaviour. It has been proven that it is possible to reduce stress, boost productivity and improve overall well-being through the choice of furniture. Brunner, a family-run company based in Baden, Germany, has long internalised these principles, offering suitable solutions for a wide range of applications that not only provide comfort, but also create memorable experiences.As an expert in ‘New Work’, Brunner designs modern work environments with forward-thinking ideas. With needs-orientated care furniture, the company makes it possible to combine practical functionality with stylish designs in healthcare and nursing facilities. In public spaces, Brunner’s customised products add character while creating a welcoming atmosphere. The portfolio also impresses in hotel, gastronomy and event settings, offering flexibility, high quality and aesthetic appeal.Hotel Luisenhöhe. Photos: Stefan MarquardtCustomized design for relaxation in the Black ForestThe Hotel Luisenhöhe is an impressive example of meeting complex customer demands. As a health resort in the Black Forest biosphere reserve, the hotel seamlessly combines modern luxury with its natural surroundings. This standard is achieved not only through the distinctive architecture but also through the functional design furniture from Brunner. With their choice of colours and materials, they set the style and create a consistently harmonious ambience. Examples can be found in almost every room of the hotel: pads seating islands create places of retreat and ray soft upholstered chairs and armchairs from the halm series in the restaurant offer a relaxing dining experience. Fabulous drinks can be enjoyed at the bar on fina bar stools or ray lounge armchairs at a break lounge table, offering breathtaking views of the natural surroundings.The functional design furniture from Brunner create a harmonious atmosphere while serving as style-defining elements that can be used in a variety of settingsThe perfect blend of comfort and aesthetics is particularly evident in the conference rooms. Multifunctional lift active nesting tables, basic V folding tables, halm stacking chairs and other flexible, mobile Brunner series allow for the creation of customised settings. The inviting atmosphere remains intact, even during large events.Similarly extensive was Brunner’s support for Hotel Munde with the redesign of its spaces, blending Black Forest traditions with modern furniture for a contemporary feel. Initially, Brunner was only asked to furnish the seminar rooms, but thanks to the countless design possibilities offered by its portfolio, the company ultimately realised all of the customer’s ideas.

This project highlights the company’s flexibility and ability to meet even the highest demands with bespoke solutions. In the restaurant and lounge area, colour and material mixes of leather and fabric for the fina club and crona upholstered armchairs create exciting contrasts that lighten the overall aesthetic of natural materials in muted tones. Other products such as the pivot standing tables or the first class stackable row chairs, also prove to be ideal choices for the Öschberghof.Hotel Öschberghof. Photos: Stefan MarquardtRelaxed furniture for exciting locationsWith its expertise in a wide range of applications in the hospitality and gastronomy sectors, Brunner is also a sought-after furnishing partner for the event industry. Through its comprehensive approach, the extensive product range is ideal for stadiums and arenas: Whether in the classic hospitality areas with functional tables and chairs, in bars with trend-setting armchairs, sofas and lounge chairs, on VIP terraces with beautifully designed outdoor furniture, in press rooms with practical stacking chairs including writing tablets, or at media workstations, in offices and boardrooms. All Brunner’s furniture are designed to prioritise people’s comfort and adapt seamlessly to different needs.‘Brunner’s furniture perfectly realised our interior idea: with outstanding design, maximum functionality and an exceptional seating comfort’After initially equipping more than 1,500 seats with high-quality furniture in the VIP and hospitality areas for the opening of the Europa Park Stadium for SC Freiburg, this season, the company has become a business partner with its own lounge. With this, the relationship to the club is strengthened and also visible to the outside world. Interior architect Clemens Bachmann from CBA, who developed the interior concept, sees his ideas perfectly realised by Brunner: ‘with outstanding design, maximum functionality and an exceptional seating comfort.’ Europa Park Stadium, home stadium for SC Freiburg. Photos: Nico WitwickiOf course, the furniture manufacturer from Baden remains impartial and collaborates with many other Bundesliga clubs. In the MHP Arena of VfB Stuttgart, which was modernised for the UEFA European Championship 2024, fans and visitors take a seat on Brunner furniture. Here, the business areas have been expanded and are designed for multifunctional use, serving as conference rooms, meeting rooms or event spaces on non-match days. Similarly, the VIP lounge in the Volkswagen Arena of VfL Wolfsburg also stands out with high-quality Brunner furniture, offering exclusivity and stylish design in the club’s colours, creating not only maximum seating comfort but also visual highlights that foster a sense of identity.

Photo: Zooey Braun)Even international giants such as Arsenal FC and Paris Saint-Germain, have chosen to work with Brunner, valuing the versatility and quality of the furniture across various areas. But Brunner is not only good at football arenas: in Baden-Baden, the mudra chairs withstand the thrill of horse racing and provide winning seating comfort in venues like the Rizzi \u0026 Co. Fine Dining Club.Long before psychological research, the sophist Antiphon recognised that the environment in which a person spends most of the day shapes their character. If this is true, Brunner contributes to greater calmness, a more positive humanity and extraordinary experiences – an excellent foundation for modern interior concepts that place people’s well-being at the centre.Guest Feature by Mareile Morawietz / Architonic",
