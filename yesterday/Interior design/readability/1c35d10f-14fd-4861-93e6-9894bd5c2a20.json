Woxna is a relatively new company looking to produce premium outdoor gear and with their folding saw aim to upgrade the (likely) weakest leg of a well-heeled bushcrafter's blade tripartite of axe, knife, saw.  The founders turned to Nikita Golovlev of Struktur Design, a Swedish industrial design firm, to help them develop it.The saw folds for protection of both hand and blade, in the garden or out in the wild.
