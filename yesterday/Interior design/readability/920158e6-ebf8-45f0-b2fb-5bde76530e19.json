  "text": "Lunar New Year 2025 is the year of the Wood Snake in the Chinese zodiac. Commonly known as the Spring Festival in China, it will fall on Wednesday, January 29, and the fifteen-day celebration will culminate on February 12, 2025. To celebrate the Year of the Snake, Longines has collaborated with Chinese artist Wu Jian’an to deliver a special edition model of its heritage marque. The timepiece designed for the Year of the Wood Snake is based on the Longines’ Conquest Heritage line that has a classic 1950s design paired with modern watchmaking technology. The Longines celebratory limited-edition Conquest Heritage model showcased ahead of the Lunar New Year has a dazzling red front embraced with signature gilt hands and indexes, and snake artwork on the back. Designer: Longines Created to add a touch of horology genius and elegance to the Longines Conquest Heritage Year of the Snake Edition has been thrown into the celebratory mood with the antics of artist Wu Jian’an, who has imbibed the spirit of the serpent onto the watch’s caseback. The final design achieved showcases a ‘mystical snake with Lingzhi mushroom in its mouth,’ which according to the press information ‘symbolizes the passage of time and the continuity of life.’ The front of the watch is more subtle, nothing fancy here except for the gradient red dial that nods to the Chinese festivity’s auspicious palette. The red hue is complemented by the Conquest Heritage collection’s signature gilt hands and indexes in yellow-gold color. The watch has a round 40mm stainless steel case accompanied by scratch-resistant sapphire crystal featuring an anti-reflective coating on both sides. Screwed-down caseback, as mentioned, is where all the fun really lies. It’s here that the artistic snake emblem reminiscent of good fortune is surrounded by the unique limited-edition number and the watch name. On the inside of the watch is a Longines in-house L888.5 calibre self-winding mechanical movement with up to 72 hours of power reserve. The Longines Conquest Heritage Year of the Snake Edition comes paired with a black alligator leather strap and is available in only 2,025 examples. The watch is now available through Longines website at $3,150.",
