  "text": "Last year, we talked tech. This year, we tackled wellness. But the two topics share more than you might think. After all, the human experience is powered by electrical currents and neural pathways all housed in some sort of organic machine. At this NeoCon 2025, Design Milk implemented a Designer Wellness Lounge within SANDOW’s DesignScene, tucked away on The Mart’s 11th floor, to serve as a sensorial escape while showcasing the transformative power of design in promoting workplace well-being. Wellness, sustainability, and biophilia have cemented themselves as essential to the future of design – with neuroaesthetics not far behind. So the Design Milk team leveraged a wealth of feedback from industry professionals and vendors alike – as well as our own trade show experiences – to fashion the ideal refuge for weary professionals passing through. With the hopes of reenergizing guests, this immersive space offered attendees a moment of respite to pause, recharge, and even reflect on their NeoCon experience. The physical lounge was thoughtfully curated as a multi-sensory experience meant to elicit a visceral reaction in support of our mission. The consciously-crafted lounge engaged all five senses and considered the practical application of each detail with a wellness-forward approach to our intimate commercial interior. Passersby first noticed our glowing, jewel-box space when turning the corner to circulate through DesignScene. Lit from within, SkyView lighting generated an inviting ambiance with the SkyView 2 and SkyView 2 Pro tables lamps, as well as the SkyView 2 Pendant Pro. Their fixtures mimic the warmth, glow, and rhythms of natural light the indoors often lack. The gently shifting hues were especially soothing as they offered a bit of change and movement throughout an otherwise static space. Upon entering, guests were also greeted by a soft room fragrance with notes of lavender generated from a MUJI Ultrasonic Aroma Diffuser. Ambient soundscapes by Sonocea, using Sonic Augmentation Technology™, emanated from a Sonos Move 2 Portable Smart Speaker, which complemented the aromatherapy and offered relief from the din of foot traffic. Those with a tendency to fidget or need to self-soothe could find entertainment in our miniature zen garden and tabletop accessories rather than resort to screen time. From artwork to surface pattern, our curated decor aimed to please varied tastes ensuring everyone would have a place to rest their eyes. Plush seating from Keilhauer invited rest and relaxation in addition to visually anchoring the physical space. Visitors could be social while enjoying a circular, communal banquet or opt for any of the other seats peppered around the room for a moment of solitude. Contemporary, geometric textiles, including Sonia Graphite Knit Throw Pillow Covers and Sonia Graphite Knit Throw Blankets from Unison Home, helped us sink deeper into coziness. But our patrons weren’t the only ones enjoying a recharge. Native Union stations with Anchor Charging Cables kept personal devices powered up as people powered down. Those feeling parched could hydrate at our hot tea bar featuring Fellow Stagg EKG Electric Kettles. The ritual of pouring a drink encouraged a change of pace, patience, and a little mindful movement. Adjacent to the drink station was a plantscape by Garden on the Wall. The preserved greens brought the outdoors in, reinforcing a connection to nature often lost while running from showroom to showroom. Partnering with some of our favorite “Design Milk Approved” brands was a pleasure for the editorial team as we realized our ever-evolving activation through this creative collaboration. What’s more, it served as an important exercise in specification that offered designers practical ideas for infusing wellness into commercial environments. The industry is full of tiny opportunities that offer a high return on the investment in very basic human needs. And our Designer Wellness Lounge is proof of concept. A big thank you to all of our “Design Milk Approved” brands including SkyView, Sonocea, Fellow, Unison Home, Sonos, Native Union, MUJI, Keilhauer, and Garden on the Wall!
