  "text": "French studio Ciguë drew on Greek modernism when creating the interior of Ace Hotel and Swim Club Athens, which features vintage furniture and specially commissioned artworks by local artists. Located in the old Fenix Hotel, a brutalist building notable for its jagged facade composed of multiple small balconies, the latest Ace Hotel has a pool and was intended to also function as a place where locals can come to swim and dine. The 120-room hotel sits outside central Athens near the Glyfada suburb and the Ellinikon – an ongoing redevelopment of the former Athens airport into residential neighbourhoods with buildings planned by BIG and Foster + Partners. The Ace Hotel and Swim Club Athens is located on the Greek RivieraCiguë focused on evoking the history of the area when creating the hotel's interior. \"The idea was to create a new urban destination around that swim club concept and the revival of the existing building, anchored in the spirit of the 1970s Athenian Riviera era: relaxed elegance, natural vibrancy, Mediterranean sensuality,\" Ciguë founding partner Alphonse Sarthout told Dezeen. \"We could say this project is like a bridge between three cities, Athens, Glyfada and the future Ellinikon, and three eras and scenes: 1950s modernist architecture heritage, 70s Riviera pool and beach culture and the contemporary Athenian art scene.\" French studio Ciguë designed its interior using vintage furnitureThe studio removed a number of 1980s and 90s interventions to showcase the bones of the building and made several changes to the layout, including turning the entire ground floor into one large public space. \"[We've] entirely redesigned the pool and its deck, opened and enlarged indoor spaces, creating transparencies from street to pool, and a new axis along its main facade – a wooden shaded walkway offering a new space between indoor and outdoor, where clients and locals can meet, giving the public access to the restaurant, the bar and the lobby,\" Sarthout said. Sandy-hued terrazzo was used for the flooringTo create a sense of continuity between the interior and exterior, the studio used a sandy-toned terrazzo in different finishes, structured by steps and travertine lines, for the flooring that extends onto the terrace. The facade was clad in white plaster with wooden accents and greenery on the balconies to soften the brutalist appearance. Ciguë also added colourful accents in the form of artwork, furniture and deep-blue ceramic tiles in the hotel's Sebastian restaurant. The brutalist hotel exterior has multiple balconiesThe studio worked with local brand Back to the Future to find the 1960s and 70s furniture and accessories that decorate the main areas and the guest rooms. \"Like art pieces, vintage furniture is essential in every Ace Hotel,\" Sarthout said. \"They show their love for design and designers, look for the richness of eclecticism, and trust the power of a well-curated selection to give personality and a spirit to a place.\" \"Vintage pieces come with their own stories and personalities, like characters in a theatre piece,\" he added. \"They also bring this sense of ageing well, inviting to be used, transmitting a sense of welcoming, to feel more relaxed and comfortable.\" Fabrics in different textures add tactile interestWooden detailing and furniture and fabric in different textures, in the form of throws, rugs and wall hangings, add tactile interest to the interior. \"We like to keep material as 'raw' as possible,\" Sarthout said. \"We were looking for a general brightness and naturality everywhere in the hotel to echo this seaside situation but balanced with warmer tones, sandy floors and wooden accents, to darker moments like the bar, the landing in the staircase and elevators with black floors. \" The guest rooms have custom-designed bed covers and artworksGreek-Egyptian designer Salma Barakat created custom bed covers for the guestrooms while the whole building was filled with artworks that were specially commissioned for the space. When entering, guests are met by facade murals from artists Claire Manent and Panos Profitis, and a silvery artwork by artist Bregje Sliepenbeek that adds a decorative touch to the lobby. A desk made from Dionysos marble decorates the receptionThe reception desk is formed of an art piece created by artist Ilias Lefas from Dionysos marble. Profitis also created aluminium wall lamps shaped like harpies for each guestroom in a nod to Greek mythology. Ciguë aimed for the artists to represent young Athenian talent working in a variety of mediums and expressions. \"In the end, this presence of art everywhere in the hotel, with all the stories it contains, creates an inhabited place like an art collector's house that resonates with its context and its time,\" Sarthout concluded. Bregje Sliepenbeek designed an art piece in silver for Ace Hotel and Swim Club AthensAce Hotel and Swim Club Athens is set to be expanded next year to also include a rooftop restaurant, bar and lounge. Ace Hotel has a number of locations around the world. Dezeen has previously featured its location in Toronto, which has large fireplaces and a rooftop bar, and Ace Hotel Brooklyn, which aims to showcase the neighbourhood's creative talent.
