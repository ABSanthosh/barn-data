There’s a cozy mix of returning classics that we know and love, along with some fresh new pieces that are sure to get you in the Christmas spirit. I popped into two Targets today to see if I could get my hands on a few of these cozy goodies in person, but to my surprise, the shelves were still empty. The excitement is clearly building because they’re not out just yet in my area! So, if you’re like me and can’t wait to deck the halls with these beauties, I’d suggest ordering online now rather than waiting around for them to hit the store shelves.Thank you so much for stopping by the blog! If you’re as excited about this collection as I am, I’d recommend snagging your favorite pieces now before they’re gone. Keep up with us daily HERE for more holiday inspiration, and happy decorating!xxLizMarie",
