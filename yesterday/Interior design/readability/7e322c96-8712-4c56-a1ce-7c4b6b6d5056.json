  "text": "Timepiece with 360-degree ring that tells minutesAyoub Ahmad designs a concept 3D printed titanium watch named STRACTRA with the hours placed over a geometric, 180-degree arc. Inspired by nature, seemingly tree branches slither around the frame, forming uniform lines on the said arc on the right side of the timepiece. Between the gaps of these coffin-shaped structures, the numbers depicting the hours are shown, colored in sunset orange. Even the hand pointing at the hours is in orange, standing out among the color scheme of titanium. For the minutes, there’s a 360-degree ring just below the hand, going in a full circle to complete the time-telling of the concept 3D printed titanium watch.all images courtesy of Ayoub AhmadOrganic lines around 3D printed titanium watch STRACTRAUnlike traditional round or square-shaped timepiece designs, the frame of the concept 3D printed titanium watch STRACTRA appears organic, as the case displays smooth and flowing lines as if they were branches of trees or just natural curves. Designer Ayoub Ahmad imagines his design to use 3D printing for production, with titanium as the main material throughout the watch. The technology can allow him to realize the design of the arc for the hours, the disc for the minutes, and the hexagonal shape of the timepiece’s body.On the left face of the concept 3D printed titanium watch STRACTRA, there’s a seemingly grille design that may have bumps for tactility, and the creeping lines cross over the minute disc in the middle to demonstrate the growth of tree branches. The arc continues from the hours to the disc in the middle, allowing the wearer to see the gears inside the watch. Next to the ring, the name of the concept 3D printed titanium watch STRACTRA appears engraved. At the time of publishing, the timepiece design is a concept project, and Ayoub Ahmad says the watch is his entry to Dubai Watch Week, which is set to return for its seventh edition between November 19th and 23rd, 2025. the timepiece design has the hours placed over a geometric, 180-degree arcthere’s a seemingly grille on the left side for tactilitysmooth surface for the rear of the timepiecedetailed view of the minute discthe name of the timepiece sits next to the minute discthe lines of the design cross over the dial",
