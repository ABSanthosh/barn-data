  "text": "Mohd curates a permanent living experience with the mohdernistLike every April, Milan pulsed with color, music, and of course design. Amid the energy of Milan Design Week, one brand reframed what living beautifully truly means. In 2025, design house Mohd unveiled The Mohdernist, a permanent installation that stretches across its two Milanese spaces: Mohd Officina Milano and Mohd Turati. More than just an exhibition, The Mohdernist is told as a tactile story, evolving like an immersive journey through layered time and taste, where the soul of a collector’s home meets the edge of contemporary design.Mohd unveiled its new permanent installation The Mohdernist during the 63rd edition of the Salone del Mobile | all images courtesy of MohdMohd shapes global luxury interiors with over 600 design brandsFounded in Sicily in 1968, Mohd (short for Mollura Home Design) has grown from a local gem into a global design authority. With showrooms in Catania, Messina, and Milan, and a robust digital platform at mohd.it, the company offers a sharp-eyed curation of over 600 of the world’s finest furniture and design brands. Besides selling iconic pieces, Mohd delivers personalized interior design services and full-scale project management, from concept to completion, in an expressive fusion of beauty and precision.Another of these fusions is The Mohdernist installation that takes the contemporary living vision to new dimensions. Here, modernist aesthetics are reframed through the lens of a 21st-century art collector, where heritage converses fluently with cutting-edge design. Each space within the installation feels like stepping into someone’s cultivated, lived-in world, where the furnishings decorate as well as narrate. The result is a curated, ever-evolving perspective on what it means to live with design.the installation expands across Mohd’s two Milanese spaces: Mohd Officina Milano and Mohd Turatithe mohdernist moves from the brutalist to bauhausInside the installation, first unveiled during Milan Design Week 2025, design is not static. Mohd builds a multidimensional environment where textures, tones, and timelines collide in harmony. Think vintage echoes juxtaposed with avant-garde silhouettes, or Bauhaus-inspired geometries softened by rich, contemporary materials. Each object is chosen both for its form and function, as well as for the atmosphere it evokes.The spatial narrative unfolds like a private loft imagined by a design-savvy collector. Visitors move through environments that fuse cultural references with eclectic sophistication: an Eames classic meets a contemporary Dimorestudio piece; a sculptural light hovers above a Brutalist table; deep blues and sun-bleached neutrals embellish the corner of a room designed for dialogue.",
