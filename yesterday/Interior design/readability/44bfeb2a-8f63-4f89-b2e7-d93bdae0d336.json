  "text": "There are wireless earbuds in tons on the market – virtually leaving you frustrated which one fits your requirements the closest. The recent trend of see-through earbuds has caught up with the early adopters who love the visual intricacy of rejoicing the innards of their loved gadgets. Nothing sparked off this long-buried fad with their maiden earbuds that caught world’s attention. The Arctis GameBuds Glorange makes you fall in love while the Moondrop Pill tingles your compulsive instinct to make the purchase right away. Somewehre in between these two options sits the Moondrop’s another pair of earbuds that has gone under the radar but is no slouch by any stretch of imagination. Perfect for space phantasy enthusiasts, the pair has a retro-modern charm with the impressive specifications that will interest audiophiles. Designer: Moondrop Moondrop Ultrasonic is a pair of earbuds in contention for being one of the most balanced visual pleasers. It is a hybrid between a see-through look and the sci-fi aesthetic dominated pair of buds. The dual-driver hybrid TWS tuned by professional engineers has a combination of DD+BA drivers on each side to deliver high-quality sound. Add to the equation a FRA Lithium-Magnesium alloy balanced armature tweeter and your search for a natural sounding high frequency spectrum is a given. The 13mm sapphire diaphragm full-frequency dynamic driver promises a thump that rivals even the most sought-after over-ear headphones. These earbuds support LDAC lossless high-resolution audio ( 24-Bit/96kHz) and an advanced high-end Bluetooth SOC chipset that enables highly efficient performance with stable Bluetooth V5.3 connectivity. A low-latency rating of 55ms means the buds are ideal for the odd gaming session, playing highly competitive FPS titles. The Moondrop UltraSonic features wide-band Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) powered by advanced Single-Feedforward ANC technology. Leveraging a next-generation flagship SoC chipset and refined acoustic engineering, it delivers robust noise-cancellation performance. The transparency mode has also been enhanced, precisely tuned to better amplify human voices and ambient sounds. Additionally, the upgraded MitsuYuki voice prompts offer a more intuitive and seamless user experience for connectivity and operation. The earbuds are very comfortable to wear for long listening sessions and the passive noise isolation is also good. Battery life on the buds is also acceptable, with 6 hours on the buds and an additional 18 hours with the charging case. The only complaints being the plastic housing of the earbuds and case, and the average battery life, which might not be deal breakers for users. In more ways than not, the Ultrasonic earbuds are a worthy successor to the Space Travel buds. Carrying a price tag of $75 make them well worth the investment and a deal maker even with the little disadvantages.",
