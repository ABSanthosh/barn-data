When people follow these myths too strictly, their homes can end up feeling flat, impersonal, or even uncomfortable. The best spaces don’t come from a rulebook, they come from experimenting, trusting your instincts, and making choices that suit your lifestyle. Let’s clear up some of the biggest design and decorating myths so you can feel more confident creating a space you love. Myth: Every Room Needs a Focal Point People are often told that every room needs one obvious centerpiece—a statement wall, a big piece of art, a bold piece of furniture, etcetera. While a focal point can help guide the eye, not every space needs one to feel balanced. Some rooms work better when attention is spread out rather than concentrated in one spot. A well-layered space with interesting textures, colors, and details throughout can feel just as inviting. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / FollowTheFlowStudio Myth: Dark Walls Make a Room Feel Smaller It’s common to hear that painting a room dark will make it feel cramped. While lighter colors do reflect more light, dark colors don’t necessarily shrink a space. In fact, deep shades like charcoal, navy, or forest green can make walls feel like they’re receding, adding depth to the room. Darker tones can also feel warmer and create a cozy, inviting atmosphere, which might be more valuable to you than a room feeling bigger. Besides, layered lighting, mirrors, and strategic furniture placement can all help a darker space feel just as open as a light one. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / bialasiewicz Myth: Small Rooms Should Only Have Small Furniture Many people assume that putting large furniture in a small room will make it feel overcrowded, but filling a space with only small pieces can make it feel cluttered and disjointed. A well-chosen larger piece, like a full-size sofa or a statement bed, can actually make a small room feel more intentional and grounded. It’s all about proportion and balance. Instead of focusing on size alone, consider the layout. A few well-placed, properly scaled pieces can make a space feel bigger than filling it with too many tiny ones. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / pro_creator Myth: Wallpaper is a Big Commitment Many people avoid wallpaper because they think it’s hard to install, difficult to remove, and will quickly go out of style. However, modern wallpaper products make this much less of an issue. Peel-and-stick options allow for easy application and removal, making them renter-friendly and commitment-free. Even traditional wallpaper is easier to strip than it used to be! As for going out of style, trends come and go in all areas of design, be it paint or otherwise, so if you find a pattern you love, it’s worth considering! Photo Credit: Envato Elements / pro_creator Myth: Matching Furniture Looks Better A matching furniture set might seem like the safest way to create a cohesive space, but it can actually make a room feel stiff and impersonal. When every piece looks the same, a space can lack the personality that mixing styles brings. A more natural, lived-in look comes from blending pieces with different materials, colors, styles, and finishes. A wood dining table with upholstered chairs or a mix of vintage and modern furniture is much more interesting than a perfectly matching set. The key is to find a balance, cohesion doesn’t have to mean everything matches perfectly. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / LightFieldStudios Myth: Rugs Should Always Fit Under All Furniture People often hear that a rug must be big enough to fit under every piece of furniture in a room, but that’s not always necessary, and is actually often a bad guideline. In a living room, having just the front legs of a sofa on the rug often looks better than having all four. A rug that’s too large will either swallow the room or make it feel cramped if you’re desperately trying to fit every piece of furniture on it. The same thing goes for a bedroom, only one or two legs of your bed need to be on a rug for it to work, not all four! Use a rug as a center point, not a frame to fit your furniture in. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / jwyma Design “rules” can be helpful, but they aren’t absolute. The best spaces come from understanding what works for your home and lifestyle, not just following trends, tips, or myths. What matters most is how a space feels to you. If a dark wall, small rug, or an oversized couch makes your home feel more comfortable and inviting, then it works! Forget the myths and trust your instincts—you’ll end up with a home that feels just right.

The key is to find a balance, cohesion doesn’t have to mean everything matches perfectly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_267006\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-267006\"\u003e            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modern-interior-with-vintage-furniture-in-loft-sty-2024-11-18-20-28-16-utc-min-68225-scaled.jpg?width=480\" media=\"(max-width: 481px)\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1709\"/\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modern-interior-with-vintage-furniture-in-loft-sty-2024-11-18-20-28-16-utc-min-68225-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Two matching chairs next to a small coffee table atop a bold rug.\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1709\" srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modern-interior-with-vintage-furniture-in-loft-sty-2024-11-18-20-28-16-utc-min-68225-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modern-interior-with-vintage-furniture-in-loft-sty-2024-11-18-20-28-16-utc-min-68225-270x180.jpg 270w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modern-interior-with-vintage-furniture-in-loft-sty-2024-11-18-20-28-16-utc-min-68225-921x615.jpg 921w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modern-interior-with-vintage-furniture-in-loft-sty-2024-11-18-20-28-16-utc-min-68225-768x513.jpg 768w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modern-interior-with-vintage-furniture-in-loft-sty-2024-11-18-20-28-16-utc-min-68225-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modern-interior-with-vintage-furniture-in-loft-sty-2024-11-18-20-28-16-utc-min-68225-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/modern-interior-with-vintage-furniture-in-loft-sty-2024-11-18-20-28-16-utc-min-68225-385x257.jpg 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"/\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\n                \n                \n            \u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-267006\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://elements.envato.com/modern-interior-with-vintage-furniture-in-loft-sty-LFVPJST\"\u003ePhoto Credit: Envato Elements / LightFieldStudios\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch2 data-start=\"5049\" data-end=\"5106\"\u003e\u003cstrong data-start=\"5052\" data-end=\"5104\"\u003eMyth: Rugs Should Always Fit Under All Furniture\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp data-start=\"5108\" data-end=\"5646\"\u003ePeople often hear that a \u003ca href=\"https://www.decoist.com/your-step-by-step-guide-on-picking-the-perfect-rug-for-any-room/\"\u003erug\u003c/a\u003e must be big enough to fit under every piece of furniture in a room, but that’s not always necessary, and is actually often a bad guideline. In a living room, having just the front legs of a sofa on the rug often looks better than having all four. A rug that’s too large will either swallow the room or make it feel cramped if you’re desperately trying to fit every piece of furniture on it. The same thing goes for a bedroom, only one or two legs of your bed need to be on a rug for it to work, not all four! Use a rug as a center point, not a frame to fit your furniture in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_267004\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-267004\"\u003e            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/living-room-2024-10-13-14-00-58-utc-80865-scaled.jpg?width=480\" media=\"(max-width: 481px)\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\"/\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/living-room-2024-10-13-14-00-58-utc-80865-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"A living room with a large rug in the center.\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/living-room-2024-10-13-14-00-58-utc-80865-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/living-room-2024-10-13-14-00-58-utc-80865-240x180.jpg 240w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/living-room-2024-10-13-14-00-58-utc-80865-820x615.jpg 820w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/living-room-2024-10-13-14-00-58-utc-80865-768x576.jpg 768w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/living-room-2024-10-13-14-00-58-utc-80865-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/living-room-2024-10-13-14-00-58-utc-80865-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/living-room-2024-10-13-14-00-58-utc-80865-385x289.jpg 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"/\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\n                \n                \n            \u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-267004\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://elements.envato.com/living-room-7JDQZQZ\"\u003ePhoto Credit: Envato Elements / jwyma\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp data-start=\"5669\" data-end=\"6199\" data-is-last-node=\"\"\u003eDesign “rules” can be helpful, but they aren’t absolute. The best spaces come from understanding what works for your home and lifestyle, not just following trends, tips, or myths. What matters most is how a space feels to you.
