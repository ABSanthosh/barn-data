  "text": "New York studio Office of Tangible Space has refreshed the interiors of the cafe at the Brooklyn Museum, ahead of the institution's 200th anniversary next year. The Brooklyn Museum Cafe is located in the building's light-filled entry pavilion, which was added to the original beaux-arts building in 2004 by Polshek Partnership Architects (now Ennead Architects). Furniture at the redesigned Brooklyn Museum Cafe is laid out like \"islands and streams\"Serving a menu by local restaurateur and sommelier André Hueston Mack, who runs the neighborhood restaurant \u0026 Sons, the redesigned cafe is intended for locals and museum-goers to enjoy light bites and drinks. \"Playing off the mission of the museum, [we] envisioned the cafe as a Brooklyn stoop where all are invited,\" said Office of Tangible Space. \"The space embodies the playfulness, creativity, craft, and expression that make Brooklyn and Brooklynites so unique.\" The cafe occupies a portion of the building's light-filled entry pavilionThe locally based studio created a fluid layout that allows visitors to meander through the space. Furniture is arranged in \"islands and streams\" that can accommodate diners in varied group sizes, as well as those stopping for a casual coffee. Periwinkle-hued tables with angled sides form snaking shapes through the space\"The space is anchored by large islands of seating and undulating streams of custom tables indicating the walking paths,\" said Office of Tangible Space. Aluminium chairs with seats and backs perforated with large holes accompany tables, including circular wooden designs for up to six guests and dark green two-tops. Dark green two-top tables are accompanied by aluminium chairs perforated with large holesOther tables made from folded sheets of thin periwinkle-hued metal have angled sides, allowing them to form snaking shapes when lined up in a row. Round cushioned poufs upholstered in pale blue and green are placed around the perimeter, which is demarcated by a set of freestanding wooden dividers and potted plants. \"The incorporation of bold color and material add to playfulness and tactility of the space,\" the studio said. For the new space, the museum and Office of Tangible Space commissioned 10 local artists to design one-off stools that are peppered through the cafe. Large round poufs are provided for more casual seatingThe handcrafted wooden seats, manufactured by Sundays, have been customised by Minjae Kim, Chen Chen and Kai Williams, Ellen Pong, Kim Mupangilaï and more. \"These handcrafted pieces not only complement the cafe's design but also echo the philosophy that food, like art, is an immersive experience – engaging the senses, sparking conversation, and creating a connection between the creator and the audience,\" said Office of Tangible Space. The cafe was redesigned ahead of the Brooklyn Museum's 200th anniversaryThe Brooklyn Museum's building, designed by McKim, Mead \u0026 White and completed in 1895, will host a variety of exhibitions and events planned to celebrate its bicentenary. These include Breaking the Mold: Brooklyn Museum at 200, a showcase celebrating the institution's collection and legacy that opens in February 2025. Founded by Michael Yarinsky and Kelley Perumbeti, Office of Tangible Space was longlisted in the emerging interior designer of the year category of Dezeen Awards 2020.
