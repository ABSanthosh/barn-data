It’s been awhile since we’ve done an “Out to See” post here on The Inspired Room and I have a charming spot to share with you today. “Out to See” is a travel series my mom named as a play on her childhood love of what she called “going out to sea” on the canal in her grandparents backyard off the Puget Sound. My husband, son and I recently went on a little day trip to Langley, Washington. Langley is at the south end of Whidbey Island overlooking the Saratoga Passage. We both spent a lot of time on Whidbey Island growing up, and it’s also where we got engaged a few years ago! The photos in this post are from two recent visits–one in summer and one in fall. It was lovely both times of year and I’m sure it will be magical in the holiday season, too. I hope you enjoy ‘coming along’ to Langley today, I’ll also share a few shop/restaurant recommendations if you visit yourself! We started off both visits with brunch at The Braeburn. It was a popular spot with a bit of a wait, but so worth it! It was so cozy inside and they have a great outdoor patio as well. The interior reminded me of one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle called The Fat Hen (which I was so sad to hear permanently closed recently!). I got the farmhouse skillet the first time, and a goat cheese/pesto omelette the second time. Both delicious! Everything on their menu looked great and they also are open for lunch and dinner some days too. This most recent visit we shared a yummy biscuit at The Commons Cafe to tide us over for brunch. Grayhorse Mercantile was one of my favorite shops we saw in Langley. Full of beautiful home items and gifts! Alma was a beautiful shop as well. I especially swooned over all the things their baby/kids’ section. This adorable alleyway sealed the deal for me that I loved Langley! The cobblestone paths, colorful buildings, fall trees, string lights, street lanterns…so charming! These bouquets outside Flying Bear stopped me in my tracks. They are a full service flower shop and have lovely gifts inside as well. I loved seeing our friend Emily Lex’s books in the SeaGlass Cove shop. (Build Book // Twirl Book) We enjoyed wandering several other shops including Callahan’s Firehouse (a glass-blowing studio with beautiful pieces), The Star Store, The Creative Bookworm bookstore, Wish by the Sea and more. We brought home some slices of pie from Whidbey Pies to have with friends at our house that night. We got several types to share and they were all so tasty! We picked up drinks at Salty Sea Coffee next door on our way out, too. We tried two of their specials and loved them both–a Cinnamon Streusel Oat Milk Latte and a Peach Pie Steamer. Does it get more peaceful than Adirondack chairs looking out at a beautiful view like this? I could have sat there all day! We saw other spots we’d like to go next time like Prima Bistro, Village Pizzeria, Sweet Mona’s Chocolate, Savory and more. If you’ve been to Langley, let me know where else we need to check out on a future visit!
