  "text": "Local practice Studio Vapore has reimagined the Western Academy of Beijing's elementary school library in China, blending elements from children's stories with traditional Chinese architectural motifs. Aiming to encourage curiosity and exploration, Studio Vapore looked to timeless children's literature from around the world for inspiration. Studio Vapore has reimagined an elementary school library in Beijing\"From the beginning, we aimed to balance the functional needs of a library with the more aspirational goal of making it a place that nurtures imagination,\" Studio Vapore founder Erica Borsa told Dezeen. \"A truly inspiring library had to be more than a functional space – it needed to spark curiosity and wonder.\" \"To bring this vision to life, we wrote an adventure story,\" she continued. \"This narrative became the design's foundation, transforming the space into a three-dimensional storybook where each element contributes to an unfolding journey of discovery.\" A Tibetan-inspired storytelling tower serves as a visual anchor within the libraryThe design drew on the architectural heritage of China, incorporating traditional roof forms and reinterpreting historical colour palettes. Shades of salmon pink, deep red, dusty blue and muted gold subtly reference the hues of ancient temples and \"something reminiscent of a 'faded' Forbidden City\". The storytelling tower leads to a suspended netThe library unfolds through a series of themed areas that introduce spatial elements commonly found in classic children's stories, such as labyrinths, caves and forests. \"As we explored children's literature, we noticed that certain spatial elements often appear,\" Borsa said. \"Building on the library's technical foundation, we sought to make it an immersive environment, weaving in these familiar storytelling elements to shape the design.\" \"No matter how a child feels on a given day, they can find a space that resonates with them,\" she continued. A temple hut with a cone-shaped roof rises above the bookshelvesAt the heart of the library stands a Tibetan-informed storytelling tower, which serves as a visual anchor and conceptual landmark. Rising from an elevated reading platform, the tower leads to a suspended net for informal gatherings. \"The idea of the tower emerged naturally as we shaped the space,\" Borsa explained. \"We introduced an elevated platform, and as we designed the staircase leading to it, the structure took on the presence of a tower—a guiding element within the library.\" \"Much like a lighthouse in a story, it becomes a reference point, something always visible, helping children orient themselves while immersing themselves in their own literary adventures,\" she continued. A \"labyrinth\" of modular, circular bookshelves create semi-private zones for independent reading and small group discussions. Rising above them, a temple hut with a cone-shaped roof offers an enclosed space for reading. Located on opposite ends of the library, the bamboo forest and village-themed area are lined with books and feature reading nooks at varying heights, including caves and circular pods. The modular, circular bookshelves create semi-private zonesWooden flooring and accents bring a sense of warmth to the space while a steel spiral staircase leading to the second-floor design classrooms adds a tactile contrast. Throughout the library, interactive features such as whispering tubes, periscopes and hidden crystals incorporate play and encourage discovery. The library features reading nooks at varying heights\"The hidden crystals near the windows cast small rainbows on the floor when the light hits them just right,\" Borsa said. \"We loved the idea that a child might notice one by chance, wonder where it came from, and start looking for the source – turning a simple walk through the library into a little discovery.\" A spiral staircase leads to the second-floor design classroomsIn order to balance quiet study areas with interactive social spaces, the studio collaborated with Delhom Acoustics to integrate acoustic design components. Ceiling panels and recycled felt panels concealing sound-absorbing wool were strategically placed to reduce noise levels. Founded by Borsa in 2021, Studio Vapore is a Beijing-based studio whose works range from architectural and interior projects to product and graphic design. Recent library projects featured on Dezeen include the Korean Cultural Center New York library designed by Studio Empathy and Praxes, and a library wrapped in orange ombre glass with white script by Snøhetta.
