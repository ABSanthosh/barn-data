I am writing this post hunkered down under 2 fur throws that are giving me warmth and comfort after coming down with a case of Covid. Ed got sick earlier in the week and said he felt like he did after we got the first Covid vaccine. He had one bad day, but soon was back at it never thinking he had Covid. Turns out he did and then I got it on Friday. No fun, but a mild case. I am literally looking at the bright side – out the sliding glass doors where a warm, sunny and sparkly 67 degree day lays ahead. I plan to go sit outside to breathe in the fresh air that will most definitely make me feel better. :-). Before I got sick, I did finish the area where we removed the kitchen cabinets. I will post the reveal this week. Now onto the inspiring links I found this week. Posts You May Have Missed This Week: Why decorating mistakes are a good thing.
