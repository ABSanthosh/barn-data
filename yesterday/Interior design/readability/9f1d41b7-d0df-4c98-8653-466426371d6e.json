  "description": "Located in Point Lonsdale, Victoria, this beach house was already full of summer memories and holidays past when the owners decided to make it their permanent home. So rather than demolishing the old beach bungalow, the couple engaged Annabel Kerr Interior Design to create a serene extension — where every inch of the space feels primed for rest and relaxation.",

  "text": "There’s an overwhelming sense of calm that washes over you as you step into this coastal home. Much of that is due to its location in Point Lonsdale, on Victoria’s Bellarine Peninsula, but the rest is thanks to a harmonious renovation by Annabel Kerr Interior Design. ‘It was a beautiful beach bungalow — old and tiny, but with so much charm,’ director Annabel Kerr says of the existing home. ‘Many memories and summers had been shared in the house, so rather than demolishing (which was probably the easier option) they kept the house and added an extension down the south side of the block.’ The front of the house however still needed a bit of a facelift. Annabel and her team ended up updating every room, restoring the original bedrooms and living areas to usher the building into a new era. Meanwhile, the extension now houses an additional living and dining area, alongside a new kitchen, and two bedrooms tucked away at the end of the floorplan. ‘Given that this house was now to become a permanent residence, [the owners] needed more space. The clients love to entertain and they have family and grandchildren who also visit,’ Annabel says, noting the bunk bedroom was designed especially for sleepovers. The interiors are relatively muted, leaving the rich warm timber joinery and accents to become the hero feature of the home. Soft white walls painted in Porter’s Paints Popcorn, sisal flooring, light-washed floorboards lean into the aesthetic of a typical coastal home, while textural furniture and the soaring ceilings give the space a more contemporary touch. The bathrooms are another highlight, with pale tan hues across the walls and CDK Stone’s travertine on the vanity. ‘There actually isn’t a huge range of materials in this project, which I love,’ Annabel adds. This carefully considered palette ensures nothing feels too loud, too modern, or out of place. Instead, it’s primed for total rest and relaxation!",
