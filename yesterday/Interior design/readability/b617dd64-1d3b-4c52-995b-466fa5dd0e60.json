  "text": "The calm and grounding aesthetic in the Eucalyptus Apartment, designed by Bodes Studio, feels effortlessly elegant. This apartment in Paris is the type that invites you in and relaxes you. The use of creamy tones, soft pinks, natural woods, and subtle gold accents feel luxurious but in an understated way. From the cozy kids’ room to the sculptural lighting and tactile materials, every corner feels quite like a breath of fresh air. Just like its namesake, eucalyptus.  The living room and kitchen stick to an open floor plan. The sectional sofa takes center stage in the living room. It is upholstered in a warm beige fabric, and is layered with textured throws and moss-toned cushions. These echo the apartment’s organic essence. A woven jute rug and sculptural brass table, in a stunning gold finish, adds visual warmth. There are built-in wall panels and soft backlighting adding depth.  Across from the sofa, a minimalist TV wall features oak cladding and a low-profile olive-toned console. Thoughtfully placed lighting—both overhead and ambient—keeps the mood cozy from day to night. The same aesthetic flows naturally into the kitchen, especially with the marble-effect porcelain tiles and fluted cabinetry. A generous island with waterfall-edge stone serves as both prep space and casual dining zone. This is accented by sculptural brass pendant lights that bring just the right touch of glam. The cabinetry is sleek and handleless, while the mixed materials—wood grain, textured white tile, and brass fixtures—create a beautifully layered look. At the center of the bedroom is a plush and low-profile bed placed over a dark wooden platform. This is strategically lit with ambient lighting. The textured headboard is upholstered in neutral fabrics, with the corner offering a small spot to place decorative items. Above, sheer curtains filter the natural light, allowing the room to stay bright yet soothing throughout the day. A special mention for the mirror-front cabinetry, adding a spacious touch to the room. An olive green workspace is separated with a wooden partition. The kids’ room brings a gentle dose of playfulness while staying true to the home’s organic aesthetic. Blush pink walls and natural wood tones set a soothing backdrop, while soft furnishings—like a round rug and plush floor cushions—invite little ones to relax, read, or play. Simultaneously, a petite desk and chair offer a space for creativity to flow, while delicate wall art adds a whimsical touch. The bathroom in the Eucalyptus Apartment is a quiet study in modern simplicity. Clad in soft stone-look tiles and matte finishes, it exudes a spa-like calm. A floating vanity in warm wood adds an organic touch. The frameless mirror and underlit cabinet keep the look sleek and refined.",
