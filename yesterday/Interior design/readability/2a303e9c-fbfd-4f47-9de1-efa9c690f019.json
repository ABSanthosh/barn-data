  "text": "Sci-fi film 2001: A Space Odyssey informed the design of this coffee shop in Miami Design District, created by NBA star Jimmy Butler and design agency DE-YAN. The first physical Bigface store opened in December 2024 ahead of the annual Art Basel fair and concurrent events around the city. A pill-shaped service counter sits at the centre of the Bigface coffee shopButler, a basketball player who's currently signed with Miami Heat, devised Bigface as a specialty coffee brand in his hotel room during the 2020 NBA playoffs. The brand's online sales grew quickly in popularity, encouraging Butler and his team to offer a \"destination\" where fans could purchase the coffee in-person as well as spend time enjoying it. The brand's smiley logo adorns the dropped ceiling over the counterDirector Stanley Kubrick's 1968 movie served as a reference point for the interior, which is predominantly white and minimally furnished like the film's spaceship setting. \"It's a futuristic yet inviting environment that's as much about the experience as it is about the coffee,\" said DE-YAN founder Dejan Jovanovic of the Bigface store. Merchandise is displayed inside backlit niches surrounded by brushed stainless steelMerchandise adorned with the smiley Bigface logo – including apparel, mugs and insulated cups – is displayed inside backlit niches set within a brushed stainless steel wall. Another display unit opposite is wrapped in the same material and houses ready-to-drink canned beverages in chillers. Ready-to-drink beverages are stored inside chillersThe logo is also enlarged and applied to the pill-shaped drop ceiling above the counter, positioned in the centre of the space. This counter follows the same round-cornered shape and has a matte-grey surface finish upon which coffee grinders and taps for cold brew are located. A glossy grey-toned floor runs throughout the building, while exposed beams and ductwork across the ceiling are all painted white to blend into the surroundings. A seating area at the back of the space, with concrete bleachers built into one corner and several black leather soft chairs placed casually in the middle. Bigface coffee packaging is replicated and enlarged as a station for drink additions\"The design concept blurs the lines between art and space, with a dynamic layout that encourages exploration and interaction,\" said the design team. \"Custom-built seating areas create a sense of intimacy, while open spaces allow for a communal experience.\" A seating area at the back provides a spot for customers to relaxThe set design of 2001: A Space Odyssey has influenced generations of interior designers, and has been used as a reference for spaces ranging from a day spa in Venezuela to a restaurant in Manhattan. Miami Design District is filled with luxury retail spaces that have interesting facades and interiors, including a Cult Gaia stor fronted with a tiled mural, PatBo's boutique featuring a \"feminine, organic\" interior, and a Diesel outpost anchored by a red spiral staircase.
