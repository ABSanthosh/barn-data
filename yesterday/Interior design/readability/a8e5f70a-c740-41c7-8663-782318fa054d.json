  "text": "The Gallery Apartment is a design by Hola Ola. In this space, thoughtful design and artistic expression go hand in hand. This home doesn’t just display art; it lives and breathes it. From sculptural furniture to curated wall pieces, every corner feels like part of a modern exhibit. It’s where clean lines meet creative moments. And everyday living feels just a little more inspired. The living room of the Gallery Apartment feels like stepping into a modern art installation, only cozier. Two sculptural sofas frame a sleek glass coffee table. Oversized, expressive artwork takes center stage on every wall, adding bold personality without overwhelming the soft palette. Organic branches, abstract lighting, and rounded forms create a space that’s equal parts serene and statement. Vivid cobalt chairs inject a burst of color into the neutral palette of the dining room. Simultaneously, sculptural decor pieces turn the tabletop into a mini art display. An oversized wall-mounted lamp adds a touch of industrial flair, offset by soft drapes and natural light. The kitchen in the Gallery Apartment features a soft palette of wood tones and creamy whites. Playful touches, like blush bar stools and a mint green pendant, add charm. Art finds its place here too, with a sunlit print on whitewashed brick giving the space a nostalgic warmth. In the bedroom, an oversized tree-etched mural sets a woodland tone, while the olive green tufted headboard adds texture. Thoughtfully layered textiles bring warmth. And the sculptural nightstand decor adds modernism. Every detail in the bedroom feels like a part of a story. Arched mirrors and soft lighting bring a spa-like calm to the bathroom. Simultaneously, the geometric tiles and twin vessel sinks add modern design. The deep soaking tub is framed by fluted stone walls and a warm wood niche. It’s a space designed for beauty as well as pause.",
