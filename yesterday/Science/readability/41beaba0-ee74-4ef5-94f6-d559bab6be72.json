  "text": "Fabien Wagner works with CTrees in an effort to map tree canopy height in the Amazon rainforest. In the process, he might have found the largest tree in the Amazon: I am currently working on a model to map the tree canopy height of the entire Amazon forest using Planet NICFI images. The model can detect canopy height up to 45-50 meters. By inspecting the results, we can discover the tallest and largest trees in the entire Amazon. For this tree, specifically: I had previously searched the data for individual trees with a crown diameter of 50-55 meters, which to my knowledge, is the largest possible crown size observed in the Amazon. After finding a few trees in this range, I realized that, statistically, an even larger tree could exist. That’s when I expanded my search, bringing me to this exceptional specimen. Pretty big.",
