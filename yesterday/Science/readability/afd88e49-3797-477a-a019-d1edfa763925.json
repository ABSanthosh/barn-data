  "description": "Researchers have developed an innovative technology in plasma spraying-physical vapor deposition known as alternating vapor/liquid phase deposition. By adjusting the arc current, researchers can finely control the evaporation and deposition of SiO2, and through a heat treatment process, achieve in-situ reactions that optimize the composition, structure, and nanoscale dimensions of the coating, creating an orderly arranged, multi-layered, teak-like biomimetic structure within it.",
