  "text": "WHERE I WORK 02 December 2024 Ioannis Binietoglou makes sure that the latest technology reaches areas that need it. Oscar Allan Oscar Allan is a freelance writer in London. Ioannis Binietoglou is a remote-sensing policy manager at the Clean Air Task Force and is based in Athens, Greece. Credit: Giacomo d’Orlando for Nature “I work for the Clean Air Task Force, a non-profit organization in Boston, Massachusetts, which aims to reduce the emissions that cause climate change by promoting and distributing the latest energy technology. It also pushes for policy changes in organizations and governments around the world. I focus on methane, which can be 80 times more damaging to the environment than carbon dioxide.In this picture, I’m testing out the latest addition to our toolkit at a coal mine in southern Greece. Methane stored in the rock is released when coal is extracted, making a substantial contribution to global emissions. The yellow box on the ground is a methane-measuring instrument, and the tablet I’m holding uses GPS data and specially designed software to generate a map of local methane.So far, we’ve used this kit with researchers in Ghana and I have plans to take it to the Côte d’Ivoire, Morocco and Colombia. The idea is that we keep the kit mobile so that as many people as possible can use it.The highly localized information that the kit produces is useful because it proves that methane is being produced in a specific location, which can help to pressure companies and governments to make changes. It can also show exactly where the methane is coming from, such as a broken pipe.
