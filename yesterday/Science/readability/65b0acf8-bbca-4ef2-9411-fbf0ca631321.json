Mission controllers were unable to solve a hydraulic issue with a clamp arm that holds onto the rocket until a few minutes before launch.On Friday, the countdown proceeded smoothly with the rocket lifting off on time into the mostly clear skies. As typical, the booster of the Falcon 9 dropped off and landed on a pad near the launch site while the second stage continued to orbit.A few minutes after the second stage completed its engine burn, the Crew Dragon spacecraft with the astronauts separated.“Thank you to all of the teams from across the world who contributed to the launch today,” Anne McClain, the NASA astronaut who serves as the commander of the mission, known as Crew-10. “Spaceflight is tough. Humans are tougher.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
