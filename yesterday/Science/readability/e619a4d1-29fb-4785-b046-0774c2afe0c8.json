  "description": "Food is culture, food is life — it’s part of who we are and the magic that binds us together. But here’s the twist: the way we eat is pushing the climate to the brink, with a third of global greenhouse gas emissions coming from the way we grow, process and waste food. Through TED Talks and conversations with chefs, scientists, activists and more, this film explores a recipe for change — and how shifting to plant-rich diets, embracing innovations like lab-grown meat and reimagining farming's regenerative future can help us feed the world without frying the planet. (Hosted by Manoush Zomorodi and featuring Jonathan Foley, Sam Kass, Pinky Cole, Jasmine Crowe-Houston, Dana Gunders, Uma Valeti, Hiroki Koga, Helianti Hilman, Jonathan Foley, Peter Dawe, June Jo Lee, Gonzalo Muñoz, Agnes Kalibata, Marcelo Mena, Andy Jarvis and Anthony Myint)",
