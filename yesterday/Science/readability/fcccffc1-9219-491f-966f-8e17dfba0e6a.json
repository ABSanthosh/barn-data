  "text": "Mark Poynting and Justin RowlattBBC Climate \u0026 ScienceA group of scientists due to work together for months at a remote Antarctic research station has been rocked after a member of the team was accused of physical assault.A team of nine researchers were due to spend the Antarctic winter at the South African-run base, which sits about 170km (about 105 miles) from the edge of the ice shelf and is difficult to reach.But a spokesperson for the South African government told the BBC \"there was an assault\" at the station, following earlier allegations of inappropriate behaviour from inside the camp.In a further message seen by the BBC, the South African environment ministry said it was responding to the concerns with \"utmost urgency\".South Africa's Sunday Times, which was first to report the story, said members of the team had pleaded to be rescued.The ministry said that those in the team had been subject to \"a number of evaluations that include background checks, reference checks, medical assessment as well as a psychometric evaluation by qualified professionals\", which all members had cleared.In a subsequent statement, the ministry added that it was \"not uncommon\" for individuals to have an initial adjustment when they arrive at extremely remote areas even if assessments showed no areas of concern.It said when the vessel departed for Antarctica on 1 February \"all was in order\", and the incident was first reported to the ministry on 27 February. The statement added the department \"immediately activated the response plan in order to mediate and restore relations at the base\". \"This process has been ongoing on an almost daily basis in order to ensure that those on the base know that the Department is supportive and willing to do whatever is needed to restore the interpersonal relationships, but also firm in dealing with issues of discipline,\" it said.The department said allegations of sexual harassment were also being investigated, but that reports of sexual assault were incorrect. The department added that a government minister was personally handling the incident, and the alleged perpetrator had \"willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative to follow any interventions that are recommended\".The alleged perpetrator has also written a formal apology to the victim, it said. The Sanae IV research base is located more than 4,000km from mainland South Africa and harsh weather conditions mean scientists can be cut off there for much of the year. The base typically houses staff who stay through the Antarctic winter for approximately 13 months. South African research expeditions have been taking place since 1959. The team to the Sanae IV base typically comprises a doctor, two mechanics, three engineers, a meteorological technician and a couple of physicists. These expeditions, with harsh weather conditions mandating a lot of time spent in a confined indoor space, normally run without incident.But on Sunday, South Africa's Sunday Times reported that one member of the team had sent an email warning of \"deeply disturbing behaviour\" by a colleague and an \"environment of fear\".A South African government spokesperson told the BBC that the alleged assault was triggered by \"a dispute over a task the team leader wanted the team to do – a weather dependant task that required a schedule change\".Incidents in Antarctica are rare, but not unprecedented. In 2018 there were reports of a stabbing at the Russian-operated Bellingshausen research station.Psychologists point to the effect that isolation can have on human behaviour.\"One thing we know from these rare occurrences, when something bad happens in enforced isolation or capsule working, is that it's often the small things, tiny things that can blow up into conflict,\" said Craig Jackson, professor of workplace health psychology at Birmingham City University, and a chartered member of the British Psychological Society.\"So issues about hierarchy, about workload allocation, even small things about leisure time or rations or food portions can rapidly flare up to become something much larger than they typically are,\" he told the BBC.Gabrielle Walker, a scientist and author who has been on expeditions to Antarctica, said working in such close proximity to a small group of colleagues had risks.\"You know exactly how they put their coffee cup down and what direction the handle points in; you know that they scratch their nose three times before they sit down; you know everything about them.\"And in the bad circumstances, it can start to irritate you… because there's nothing else – there's no other stimulus and you're with people 24/7,\" she said.Sources within the Antarctic research community have told the BBC that South Africa has access to an ice-capable ship and aircraft if needed.But any rescue operation would have to contend with the harsh climate, with temperatures well below freezing and the possibility of strong winds.",
