The finding brings physicists and astronomers one step closer to understanding just what, exactly, is out there thrusting particles to such unfathomable speeds.At a news conference on Tuesday, researchers described the discovery as a peek into what the universe looks like at its most extreme. “We’ve just opened a completely new window,” said Paschal Coyle, an astroparticle physicist at the Center for Particle Physics of Marseille in France. “It’s really a very exciting first glimpse into this energy regime.”Neutrinos are notoriously antisocial. Unlike most other particles, they are nearly weightless and carry no electrical charge, so they do not regularly collide, repel or otherwise interact with matter. They flow through nearly everything — the innards of stars, the churning dust of galaxies, ordinary people — without a trace.Thus unimpeded, neutrinos point straight back to their origins, making them excellent guides to the natural, yet-unknown “cosmic accelerators” that created them. They are also spectacularly elusive, and for decades scientists have worked to trap them with instruments deep in the mountains, beneath frozen lakes and buried in Antarctic ice.But no neutrino captured previously has resembled anything quite like this one. Scientists found the ultrahigh energy neutrino using the Kilometer Cube Neutrino Telescope, or KM3NeT, which is still under construction but already operating. The instrument consists of a pair of detectors a couple of miles beneath the surface of the Mediterranean, off the coasts of France and Sicily.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
