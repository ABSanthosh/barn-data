Language Sweeps Through the SciencesPresident Trump’s executive order is altering scientific exploration across a broad swath of fields, even beyond government agencies, researchers say.Internal documents at the Brookhaven National Laboratory were being scrubbed of references related to diversity, equity and inclusion.Credit...Brookhaven National LaboratoryFeb. 9, 2025Updated 3:10 p.m. ETThe National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine is an independent, 162-year-old nongovernmental agency tasked with investigating and reporting on a wide range of subjects. In recent years, diversity, equity and inclusion — collectively known as D.E.I. — have been central to its agenda.But the Academies’ priorities changed abruptly on Jan. 31. Shortly after receiving a “stop work” order from the Trump administration, the institute closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion, removed prominent links to its work on D.E.I. from its website’s homepage and paused projects on related themes.Now the website highlights the Academies’ interest in artificial intelligence and “our work to build a robust economy.”The quick about-face reflects the widespread impact that President Trump’s executive order on D.E.I. is having on scientific institutions across the nation, both governmental and private. The crackdown is altering scientific exploration and research agendas across a broad swath of fields.NASA cut requirements for inclusivity from several of its programs. The National Institutes of Health removed the application for its new Environmental Justice Scholars Program. National laboratories under the Department of Energy took down web pages that had expressed a commitment to diversity, while the department suspended its promotion of inclusive and equitable research.None of these federal agencies responded to requests for comment.Many organizations initiated D.E.I. programs as a way to correct historical underrepresentation in the sciences. According to one report, in 2021, just 35 percent of STEM employees were women, 9 percent were Black and less than 1 percent were Indigenous.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
