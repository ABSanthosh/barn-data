  "description": "Researchers have developed a method to enhance the separation of chemical isomers by controlling molecular diffusion. Utilizing a metal-organic framework thin film, they applied dynamic chemical interactions to adjust pore dynamics and reverse isomer diffusion preferences. Their work is published in Nature Communications.",
