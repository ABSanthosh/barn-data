  "description": "This is episode five of Swimming with Shadows: A Radiolab Week of Sharks.Today, the strange, squirmy magic behind how sharks make more sharks. Drills. Drama. Death. Even a coliseum of baby sharks duking it out inside mom’s womb. And a man on a small island in the Mediterranean trying, against all odds, to give baby sharks a chance in a little plastic aquarium in his living room. Can a human raise a shark? And if so, what good is that for sharks? And for us? Doo doo doo doo doo doo.Special thanks to Jaime Penadés Suay and la Fundación Azul Marino.EPISODE CREDITS: Reported by - Rachael CusickProduced by - Rachael Cusickwith mixing help from - Jeremy BloomFact-checking by - Diane Kellyand Edited by  - Pat WaltersEPISODE CITATIONS:Articles - Claudia’s original reporting that inspired the episodeSignup for our newsletter!!
