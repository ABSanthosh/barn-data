While the Starship’s giant booster stage was unable to repeat a “chopsticks” landing, the vehicle’s upper stage successfully splashed down in the Indian Ocean.CreditCredit...SpaceX, via Associated PressNov. 19, 2024Updated 7:29 p.m. ETSpaceX’s latest test flight of its Starship vehicle on Tuesday got off to a sobering start as the company was unable to recover the enormous booster stage of the rocket, the most powerful ever built. But about an hour later, the vehicle’s upper stage was more successful as it completed a daring maneuver to splash down in the Indian Ocean.It’s not unusual for a test launch to be unable to achieve all of its goals. But after a successful test flight last month, SpaceX’s most recent attempt experienced a partial setback that suggests the company has some work left to do as it pursues rapid reusability of the vehicle. That is a prerequisite for the pipe dream of the company’s founder, Elon Musk, of sending people to Mars in the years ahead.“Development testing, by definition, is unpredictable,” said Jessica Anderson, a manufacturing engineering manager at SpaceX and one host of the live broadcast. “But that is exactly why we test.”The rocket lifted off on time at 4 p.m. Central time from a launch site in South Texas along the Gulf of Mexico. President-elect Donald J. Trump observed the flight’s start from a nearby location.A goal of the flight had been for Super Heavy, the large booster stage, to snap back into its original place on the tower it lifted off from, as it did in October, caught by a pair of mechanical “chopsticks.” But after an initial “go for catch” command minutes into the flight, an updated command was given for the booster to skip the complicated maneuver, and it instead performed a smoky splashdown into the Gulf of Mexico.While the booster did not make it back to the launch tower , the rocket’s upper stage traveled on for about an hour. It achieved an important objective of the test flight as it traveled through space toward the Indian Ocean. Around 35 minutes into the journey, SpaceX engineers reignited one of Starship’s engines in space for the first time, a crucial step for future orbital flights of the vehicle.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
