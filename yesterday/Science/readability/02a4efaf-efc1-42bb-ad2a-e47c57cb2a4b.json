  "text": "In 2022, as COVID was sending children to the hospital, Dr. Vinay Prasad instead fretted about “truly dangerous diseases, like polio and measles.” He spoke about the value of routine vaccines and said: Measles can be a devastating childhood illness, but vaccination provides durable, sterilizing immunity. When vaccination rates are high, measles outbreaks can be averted. Elsewhere he said “measles vaccine is sterilizing and high rates are needed to halt spread.” All this is 100% correct, and as vaccines are threatened as never before, doctors should repeat this message loudly and clearly. However, Dr. Prasad wasn’t motivated by a sincere concern for routine vaccines at that time. Those sentences come from articles titled Covid Vaccines Shouldn’t Be ‘Routine’ for Kids and A Pro-Con Debate: Should Doctors Encourage Healthy Kids 11 and Under be Vaccinated Against COVID-19?. Dr. Prasad’s goal was to promote the absurd myth that routine vaccines were in competition with the COVID vaccine. His singular passion for the past 4 years has been to repeatedly infect unvaccinated children with SARS-CoV-2, even if that required him to fake a concern about routine vaccines for a brief period in 2022. Indeed, even though Dr. Prasad now has great influence and power as the head of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, he’s said nothing about measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, polio, and Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib). He’s not uttered a word as his boss spread blatant anti-vaxx disinformation. His silence is an implicit endorsement of these lies, even as measles and pertussis spread, under his watch. Dr. Prasad didn’t start these fires, but he is the Medical Establishment, and it’s his job to help put them out. Conversely, it’s our job to call on Dr. Prasad to do things, just like he did with his predecessors. I am calling on Dr. Prasad to inform parents that vaccines are safe and effective at preventing dangerous diseases. I am calling on him to refute RFK Jr.’s disinformation. I am calling on him to do this on camera and social media with the same passion he brought to his incessant ramblings about rare, temporary vaccine side effects. This is the bare minimum for someone in his position, like a fireman promoting smoke detectors or a lifeguard promoting swim lessons. As things stand now, Dr. Prasad is the only oncologist in the country who won’t say the image below is dangerous disinformation. What a pathetic place for a once respected doctor to end up, though it is America’s children who will pay the price for his cowardice and ambition. Dr. Jonathan Howard is a neurologist and psychiatrist who has been interested in vaccines since long before COVID-19.
