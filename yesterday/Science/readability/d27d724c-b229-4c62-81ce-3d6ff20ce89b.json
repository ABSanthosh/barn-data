  "text": "Being able to work with microdata from the American Time Use Survey, via IPUMS, means you can subset, filter, and categorize how you want. This makes it easier to explore questions. I use IPUMS data a lot, which makes it easier to subset and download microdata from U.S. government organizations, such as the Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics. We learned how to download data via IPUMS a while back. In this tutorial, you’ll learn the steps to process such data, which can be applied to other datasets.

Membership You will get unlimited access to step-by-step visualization courses and tutorials for insight and presentation — all while supporting an independent site. Files and data are included so that you can more easily apply what you learn in your own work. Learn to make great charts that are beautiful and useful.
