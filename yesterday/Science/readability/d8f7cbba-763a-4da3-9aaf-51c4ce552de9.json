Known as aridification, this gradual drying trend now affects 2.3 billion people and 40% of Earth's land, with serious implications for agriculture and water systems—especially in the U.S. From California's Central Valley to the Great Plains, often called the world's breadbasket, farmers are facing tough decisions about what to plant, how to irrigate, and how to adapt to a future where water is no longer guaranteed. These findings appear in the Nature Water article \"Increasing aridification calls for urgent global adaptive solutions and policy action,\" led by Mississippi State University Associate Vice President and Professor Narcisa Pricope in collaboration with a team of international scientists. \"Mississippi State is leading the way in tackling global challenges with research that delivers real-world impact,\" said Julie Jordan, vice president for research and economic development. \"Dr. Pricope's work exemplifies how our scientists are connecting international science with practical solutions that shape policies and practices to strengthen resilience across the globe.\" The research was presented at the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, a global platform where science meets policy. There, Pricope and her team helped inform international strategies to address the growing risk of long-term drying—not just temporary droughts, but a permanent reduction in water availability. \"This research has real implications for Mississippi,\" said Pricope. \"When our lands dry out, it's not just farmers who suffer. Water becomes harder to manage, ecosystems get stressed, and rural communities—already stretched thin—face even greater challenges.\" The team's work highlights solutions that can help Mississippi and the U.S. stay ahead of the curve, including smarter irrigation strategies, better monitoring through data analytics, growing drought-tolerant crops, and restoring degraded land to retain more water and reduce long-term risk. They emphasize transitioning from reacting to crises to planning ahead, bringing together water management, land restoration, and farming support into one coordinated strategy. \"Aridification isn't just a global issue with little bearing for our lives in Mississippi and the U.S.,\" Pricope said. \"We need to act now to protect our farms, forests and families.\" More information: Narcisa G.
