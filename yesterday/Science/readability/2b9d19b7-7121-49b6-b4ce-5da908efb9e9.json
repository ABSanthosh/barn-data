But there is no consensus about what caused its unusual tint.Orange you glad to learn something about this snowy owl?Credit...Julie MaggertMarch 11, 2025, 11:36 a.m. ETBill Diller, a photographer living in Huron County, Mich., had never seen a snowy owl quite like this.In January, Mr. Diller’s neighbor told him about a “red-spotted snowy owl” in the area. It’s a part of Michigan known as “the Thumb,” which becomes home to many snowy owls in the winter.People were calling the bird “Rusty.”“I had never heard of such a thing,” Mr. Diller said, “so I figured either he didn’t know what he was talking about or this was some kind of exotic bird from Asia.”When he soon shared pictures on Facebook of the eye-catchingly orange bird perched atop a utility pole, he helped create a feathered phenomenon. The discovery has perplexed avian experts, too, creating an enduring mystery about what might have made a white bird turn bright orange.Julie Maggert, a snowy owl enthusiast, heard of Mr. Diller’s sighting and became determined to see “Creamsicle,” as she affectionately nicknamed the bird.She made a series of visits over several days from her home in Central Michigan with her Nikon Z8 and a zoom lens. After hours of waiting at a respectful distance, she finally got the perfect shot of the tinted bird on a telephone pole.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
