Quarter-size with legs outstretched, these spiders attach their webs to everything, whether rocks and grass or human objects. They weave a kind of funnel into their webs where they typically hide from predators. Their silk isn’t sticky, so they rely on speed and ambush. After sensing prey on their webs, they burst out and attack, injecting their victims with venom and then liquefying their insides for easy digestion.Spiders don’t have ears like humans, so they don’t necessarily hear things in the traditional way. But sound produces vibrations that travel through the ground and into their webs via silk strands.“They really rely on those accurate vibrations to determine where the prey is, what the prey is and whether to attack,” Dr. Pessman said.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
