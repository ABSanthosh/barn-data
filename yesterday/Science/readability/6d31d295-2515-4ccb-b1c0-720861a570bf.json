  "text": "For NYT Opinion, Gus Wezerek compared ad views per household: To figure out which party won this election’s ad war, Times Opinion dug into data on 3.7 million political ad airings on broadcast TV from Aug. 1 to Oct. 25. We combined those records, provided by AdImpact, with TV viewership estimates from Comscore to calculate how many households saw each ad. The inner semicircles represent views for presidential ads, and the less prominent outer semicircles represent views for other ads from the respective party. I could’ve sworn I’ve seen this view for something election-related years ago, but I could not find it. The closest I could find was word usage during national conventions with vertically sliced circles and election ad topics with slice squares. Please let me know if you remember, as it will be lurking at the back of my mind until I do. Chart Type Used",
