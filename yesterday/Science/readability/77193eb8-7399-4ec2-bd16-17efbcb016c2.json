  "description": "Host Rachel Feltman explores the surprising connection between exercise and the gut microbiome with Scientific American contributing editor Lydia Denworth. Drawing from her latest reporting, Denworth explains how aerobic activity can influence the microbial ecosystems in our digestive tract—boosting diversity, reducing inflammation, and even supporting muscle development and mental well-being. From mouse wheels to marathoners, this episode offers a compelling look at why breaking a sweat might be one of the best things you can do for your gut. This episode was made possible by the support of Yakult and produced independently by Scientific American’s board of editors.
