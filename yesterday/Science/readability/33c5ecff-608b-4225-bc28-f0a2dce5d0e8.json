  "text": "A number of federal employees at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the US federal agency that monitors and models the oceans and atmosphere for the purpose of predicting changes in climate and weather, have received orders to temporarily cease communicating with foreign nationals, including those working directly with the US government, WIRED has learned.An internal email obtained by WIRED shows that NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) received orders to pause all “ALL INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENTS.” (Emphasis theirs.) The message states that the orders extend to participation in international commissions and even emails “with foreign national colleagues.”The email further instructs NMFS employees—responsible for promoting the conservation of sealife and sustainability of America’s seafood sources—to submit details of any ongoing work with international partners for vetting by higher-ups, including those at the US Department of Commerce (DOC), NOAA’s umbrella agency.The NOAA and DOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The motive behind the incommunicado orders and is not immediately clear, nor how long they will last.According to a source with knowledge of NMFS operations, granted anonymity because—as with other sources in this story—they were not authorized to speak to the press, NOAA officials discussed in a meeting Wednesday feeling targeted by the Trump administration, saying their work faces “huge exposure” due to offshore wind projects and participation in international wind energy workshops, conferences, and summits.The agency had been anticipating, for example, hosting international fellows and interns this summer associated with an offshore wind development working group founded by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, the world's oldest intergovernmental science organization.President Donald Trump issued an executive order on his first day in office designed to paralyze growth in wind energy. In a post-inaugural speech, he told rallygoers: “We're not going to do the wind thing.”According to another source at the NOAA, the incommunicado orders extend to the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS). In addition to gathering data from across the federal government, NESDIS relies on a wide range of international partners. NESDIS’s weather and climate data is essential not only to air transportation safety, but to combat drought, monitor coral reef destruction, and safeguard railway shipping carriers against dangerous weather.According to NESDIS’s website, it works closely with the European Space Agency, which provides access to data via a collection of Sentinel satellites maintained by EUMETSAT, an international weather monitoring agency composed of more than 30 member states.WIRED reported Wednesday that NOAA officials had been ordered to grant Nikhil Rajpal, a former Twitter employee who appears to have no expertise in ocean and atmospheric science, the power to edit documents concerning the agency’s work hosted by Google Sites. The orders, sources said, came from acting commerce secretary, Jeremy Pelter.Government records show Rajpal now has working email addresses with both NOAA and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficient (DOGE) task force. WIRED has also learned that Rajpal is listed as an “expert” on a roster at the Office of Personnel Management, the government’s human resources department, where DOGE operatives have installed a server gathering information on federal employees that has been used to repeatedly communicate the administration’s deferred resignation program.The NOAA has been a popular target of conservatives, many of whom have called for various of its functions to either be dismantled or privatized.",
