During the countdown, SpaceX encountered a hydraulic issue with a clamp arm that holds onto the Falcon 9 rocket before it launches.If the issue can be fixed quickly, SpaceX could try again on Thursday. There is another launch opportunity on Friday.Here’s other information about the mission, which is named Crew-10 because it is the 10th such mission by SpaceX ferrying crew to and from the space station.Who is going to space on Crew-10?Anne McClain of NASA is the commander of Crew-10, and Nichole Ayers of NASA is the pilot. The other two crew members are Takuya Onishi of JAXA, the Japanese space agency, and Kirill Peskov of Roscosmos, the Russian space agency.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
