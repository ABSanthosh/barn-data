  "text": "Using faded lines to show the overall changes in a time series and to provide a point of reference for the present. To show how employment changed over the decades, given your age, I used an interactive line chart with faded trails. I was trying to give a sense a movement that was similar to charts on marital status over time. In this tutorial, you’ll make the chart.
