  "text": "Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. The head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services department, RFK Jr. recently said doctors were seeing “almost miraculous and instantaneous” results from treating measles with a cod liver oil, vitamins, a steroid called budesonide, and an antibiotic called clarithromycin. Though this is false, people are listing unfortunately. An article titled Keeping With Kennedy’s Advice, Measles Patients Turn to Unproven Treatments In West Texas quoted Katherine Wells, the director of public health in Lubbock, Texas, as saying: I’m worried we have kids and parents that are taking all of these other medications and then delaying care. Some seriously ill children had been given alternative remedies like cod liver oil. If they’re so, so sick and have low oxygen levels, they should have been in the hospital a day or two earlier. Beyond harming innocent children, RFK Jr. illustrates another core feature of the anti-vaxx movement- their eagerness to use chemicals and drugs to cover up the symptoms of diseases, rather than prevent them in the first place. Unsurprisingly, these chemicals and drugs have names that are impossible to pronounce. Can you say (2E,4E,6E,8E)-3,7-dimethyl-9-(2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-en-1-yl)nona-2,4,6,8-tetraen-1-ol or 11β,21-dihydroxy-16α,17α-(butylidenebis(oxy))pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione? Me neither. Even 6-O-methylerythromycin doesn’t exactly roll of the tongue, and cod liver oil contains two acids, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Yet, despite telling us that such unpronounceable drugs and chemicals are dangerous, RFK Jr. wants to give them to our sickest, most vulnerable children. Obviously, they have toxic side effects and most have not been tested for measles. Don’t take my word for it. It’s all there in the package insert. The insert for budesonide even says: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. That’s not encouraging. The package insert for budensonide. Would you give a drug that can do all this to your sick child? Measles Cases Linked to Texas Outbreak Grows to 259, With Just 2 Among Fully Vaccinated People Fortunately, there is a better way. Millions of parents have embraced a holistic approach, one that boosts the immune system by harnessing children’s innate, natural ability to prevent illness. As the article Measles Cases Linked to Texas Outbreak Grows to 259, With Just 2 Among Fully Vaccinated People shows, just two vaccine doses are incredibly effective at preventing measles for life. The MMR’s safety and efficacy has been established in children for over 60 years, via billions of doses, though its roots can be traced back to traditional Chinese healers. Of course, they won’t tell you this. RFK Jr., who is now the epitome of the Medical Establishment, has close ties with big names in the supplement business, a powerful industry that was valued at $177.5 billion in 2023. Big Suppla knows that a patient cured is a customer lost, and they are perfectly willing to suppress preventative treatments to expand their market share. Indeed, RFK Jr. recently claimed that measles protects against cancer and heart disease, and an article titled RFK Jr.: It Would Be Better If ‘Everybody Got Measles quoted him as saying: It used to be that everybody got measles. And the measles gave you lifetime protection against measles infection. The vaccine doesn’t do that. The vaccine is effective for some people for life, but for many people it wanes. He also said:  There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year. It causes all the illnesses that measles itself cause. RFK Jr. spreads such lies because he wants to cover up the symptoms of diseases with untested, unsafe, unpronounceable chemicals and drugs, all to help his partners sell more supplements and assorted chicanery. In contrast, we here at SBM strongly believe it’s best to prevent the root cause of diseases, and we don’t get paid a dime to say so.
