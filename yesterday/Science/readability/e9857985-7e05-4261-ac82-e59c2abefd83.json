  "description": "In his 2000 bestseller \"The Tipping Point,\" Malcolm Gladwell told the story of why crime fell in New York City in the 1990s. Now, 25 years later, he's back with a confession and a mea culpa: \"I was wrong,\" he says. He shares how his analysis contributed to the rise of the infamous \"stop and frisk\" policing policy in New York City — and shows why journalists should avoid the trap of imagining a story is ever really over.
