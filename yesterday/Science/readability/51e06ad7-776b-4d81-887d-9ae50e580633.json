The test, known as a hot fire, was the last big technical hurdle. The next time the engines fire, the rocket, known as New Glenn, should be heading to space on its inaugural flight.“Next stop launch,” Mr. Bezos posted on the social media site X, sharing a video of the engines firing.Neither Mr. Bezos nor his company announced a launch date. While Blue Origin officials had promised to launch this year, an advisory posted on an aviation industry website indicates it will miss that target by at least a few days into the new year, and could launch as early as Jan. 6.Earlier in the day, the Federal Aviation Administration removed the final administrative hurdle to liftoff by issuing a launch license for New Glenn.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
