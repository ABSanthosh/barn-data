Traci Watson Traci Watson a senior editor for news and research highlights at Nature. She is based in Washington DC. Artificially-coloured nerve fibres in a mouse’s hippocampus, the brain region where new memories are encoded.Credit: Mark \u0026 Mary Stevens Neuroimaging \u0026 Informatics Institute/Science Photo LibraryNew clues have emerged in the mystery of how the brain avoids ‘catastrophic forgetting’ — the distortion and overwriting of previously established memories when new ones are created.A research team has found that, at least in mice, the brain processes new and old memories in separate phases of sleep, which might prevent mixing between the two. Assuming that the finding is confirmed in other animals, “I put all my money that this segregation will also occur in humans”, says György Buzsáki, a systems neuroscientist at New York University in New York City. That’s because memory is an evolutionarily ancient system, says Buzsáki, who was not part of the research team but once supervised the work of some of its members.The work was published on Wednesday in Nature1.Window on the brainScientists have long known that, during sleep, the brain ‘replays’ recent experiences: the same neurons involved in an experience fire in the same order. This mechanism helps to solidify the experience as a memory and prepare it for long-term storage.To study brain function during sleep, the research team exploited a quirk of mice: their eyes are partially open during some stages of slumber. The team monitored one eye in each mouse as it slept. During a deep phase of sleep, the researchers observed the pupils shrink and then return to their original, larger size repeatedly, with each cycle lasting roughly one minute. Neuron recordings showed that most of the brain’s replay of experiences took place when the animals’ pupils were small.Sleep loss impairs memory of smells, worm research showsThat led the scientists to wonder whether pupil size and memory processing are linked. To find out, they enlisted a technique called optogenetics, which uses light to either trigger or suppress the electrical activity of genetically engineered neurons in the brain. First, they trained engineered mice to find a sweet treat hidden on a platform. Immediately after these lessons, as the mice slept, the authors used optogenetics to reduce bursts of neuronal firing that have been linked to replay. They did so during both the small-pupil and large-pupil stages of sleep.Once awakened, the mice had completely forgotten the location of the treat — but only if firing had been reduced during the small-pupil stage. “We wiped out the memory,” says Wenbo Tang, a co-author of the Nature paper and a systems neuroscientist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.By contrast, when the team reduced bursts of neuron firing in the large-pupil phase shortly after a lesson, the mice went straight to the treat — making clear that their fresh memories were intact. doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-04232-1 References Related Articles The brain summons deep sleep for healing from life-threatening injury Sleep deprivation disrupts memory: here’s why Memories are made by breaking DNA — and fixing it Subjects Latest on:",
