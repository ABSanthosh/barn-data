  "description": "The Medical Freedom or the Health Freedom Movement is not new, but it is currently gaining more traction and attention under RFK, Jr. On its face, it is a political movement that distrusts pharmaceutical companies and government regulations for supplements. But Dr. Sydnee talks about its history and roots in strange conspiracies and biases from the 1950s â€“ and what the movement means for us today.Music: \"Medicines\" by The Taxpayers https://taxpayers.bandcamp.com/\"The John Birch Society\" by The Chad Mitchell Trio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWCYSVZhPoUNational Immigration Project: https://nipnlg.org/about/who-we-are",
