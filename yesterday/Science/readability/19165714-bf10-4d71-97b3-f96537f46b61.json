There are tables for young children, older children, and adults. Green represents a recommendation for everyone. Yellow represents a recommendation for a subset. It’s annoying that this is necessary, but it is necessary. It seems wise to keep watch on how these reproduced tables compare against shifting CDC recommendations. Chart Types Used",
