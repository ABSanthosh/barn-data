  "description": "Excitons, encountered in technologies like solar cells and TVs, are quasiparticles formed by an electron and a positively charged \"hole,\" moving together in a semiconductor. Created when an electron is excited to a higher energy state, excitons transfer energy without carrying a net charge. While their behavior in traditional semiconductors is well understood, excitons act differently in organic semiconductors.",
