  "text": "Reporting on missions to the moon and beyondWhat to know about the moon lander’s status.ImageAn image beamed from the Intuitive Machines Athena lander as it approached the moon on Thursday.Credit...NASA, via Associated PressAthena didn’t crash. But what did happen to it?Hours after the 15-foot-tall robotic spacecraft arrived at the moon’s surface, closer to the lunar south pole than any spacecraft has been, it remained unclear whether its touchdown was smooth enough to perform its intended work, or if it toppled over in the process, potentially limiting the mission’s scientific achievements.“We’re trying to evaluate exactly what happened in that last bit,” Tim Crain, the chief technology officer of Intuitive Machines, said at a news conference.The spacecraft is almost identical to Odysseus, the lander that the company sent to the moon last year. Odysseus was the first commercially operated vehicle to successfully land on the moon. But that success came with an asterisk when the vehicle toppled shortly after reaching the ground.It appears that might have happened again.At a post-landing news conference, Steve Altemus, the chief executive of Intuitive Machines, said the spacecraft had sent back conflicting data about whether it was standing upright or tipped over. But a sensor known as an inertial measurement unit offered a perhaps convincing clue that Athena was on its side.As it headed to the lunar surface, laser instruments that measured the lander’s altitude were providing noisy data, which may have contributed to the botched landing.Until that final descent, Athena had performed much more smoothly than the Odysseus lander a year ago, said Dr. Crain of Intuitive Machines. “We were expecting a fully successful landing,” he said.ImageA rendering of the Athena lunar lander on the moon.Credit...Intuitive MachinesMr. Altemus said it was too soon to determine how much of the planned mission could still be salvaged. Athena’s payloads include a drill, three small rovers and a rocket-powered hopping drone.“When we get that full assessment, we will then work closely with NASA science and technology groups to identify science objectives that are the highest priority,” Mr. Altemus said. “And then we’ll figure out what the mission profile will look like.”The spacecraft is not generating as much power as it should, probably because the solar panels are not pointed in the correct direction.Images from cameras on the spacecraft will help Intuitive Machines figure out the orientation of the spacecraft. Dr. Crain said the spacecraft probably set down outside of the planned landing zone but was confident it was still somewhere on Mons Mouton, a high plateau near the south pole that Athena was to explore.Images from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which will pass over the landing site, could pinpoint Athena’s precise location.It has been a busy week in spaceflight and on the moon. Intuitive Machines was the second company to reach the lunar surface this week, after Firefly Aerospace, another Texas space company, successfully reached the Mare Crisium region of the moon on Sunday morning.“Any time humanity puts a lander on the moon, it’s a good day,” Dr. Crain said.The main customer of both missions is NASA under its Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, which hires private companies to take NASA-financed science and technology payloads to the lunar surface. The NASA contract for this mission is worth up to $62.5 million, but Intuitive Machines may not be paid the full amount.ImageLunar Outpost’s Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform, or MAPP, is about the largest of three rovers Athena carried.Credit...Lunar OutpostImageA team of engineers from NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston and Honeybee Robotics in Altadena, Calif., inspecting the TRIDENT drill shortly after its arrival at the integration and test facility.Credit...Robert Markowitz/NASAShares of Intuitive Machines, which trades under the name LUNR after going public in 2023, tumbled after reports of the spacecraft’s problems. Its stock fell 20 percent on Thursday.The main payload on Athena is a drill for NASA that will extract lunar soil to be sniffed by a mass spectrometer for frozen water and other compounds. NASA officials said it might be possible for the drill to work, even if the spacecraft was not vertical. “It doesn’t have to be directly where I can drill straight down,” said Clayton Turner, the associate administrator for NASA’s space technology mission director. “There are other options we can use, too.”Also aboard is a rover the size of a small dog that will test a Nokia cellphone network on the moon, and two smaller rovers, one built by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the other by a Japanese company. Intuitive Machines also planned to test a rocket-powered vehicle called a hopper that could explore places not easily reached by rovers.A parade of lunar landers is expected to continue through the rest of the year.One of those spacecraft is already in space. The Resilience lander from Ispace of Japan was launched on the same SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that sent Firefly’s Blue Ghost on its way. But it is taking a longer, more fuel-efficient path to the moon. It will enter orbit around the moon around May 6 and try a landing a month later at Mare Frigoris, or the Sea of Cold, in the moon’s northern hemisphere.In the fall, Astrobotic Technology of Pittsburgh is planning to try to get to the moon flying a large lander known as Griffin that will carry a commercial rover designed by Lunar Outpost of Golden, Colo., among other cargo.The most intriguing lander is the one planned by Blue Origin, the rocket company started by Jeff Bezos. The lander, known as Blue Moon Mark 1, will be the largest spacecraft ever to set down on the moon, even larger than the ones that took NASA astronauts to the moon during the Apollo moon landings more than 50 years ago.Danielle Kaye contributed reporting.Steve Altemus, the Intuitive Machines chief executive, says that while it’s natural to think that the spacecraft has a high center of gravity and is more likely to tip over because of its height and slim profile, the spacecraft actually had a low center of gravity because of what was on board. He said they are confident in their design and engineering of the Odysseus and Athena landers.“Any time humanity puts a lander on the moon, it’s a good day,” said Tim Crain, the Intuitive Machines chief technology officer.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTClayton Turner, associate administrator of NASA’s space technology mission directorate, suggests that there are scenarios in which TRIDENT, the drill that is to study the frozen water content of the lunar dirt, could still function even if the spacecraft is not perfectly upright.“There’s quite a number of objectives we can meet,” Altemus said in reference to the scientific instruments and technology demonstrations, but the company has to assess the priorities based on the spacecraft’s status.An eclipse is coming on both Earth and the moon.ImageA total lunar eclipse seen from Melbourne, Australia, in 2022.Credit...James Ross/EPA, via ShutterstockIf this week’s lunar landing attempts have you more interested in space and astronomy, keep your eyes pointed skyward. Soon you’ll get to witness a total lunar eclipse.Starting March 13 into early March 14, Earth’s shadow will cross over the moon, creating the reddish-brown effect on the ordinarily bright lunar surface that some call a blood moon. The eclipse will be most visible across parts of the Americas and the Pacific, but also experienced in Europe and western Africa.That eclipse will also be experienced on the moon at about 2 a.m. Eastern time on March 14. Darkness will fall for several hours, with Earth blocking the sun.Firefly Aerospace said that its Blue Ghost lander would observe and record the eclipse from its landing site, in Mare Crisium. If the Athena lander is functioning at that time, it is likely to do the same.Kenneth Chang contributed reporting.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“We’re in the vicinity of the intended landing site,” said Steve Altemus, the Intuitive Machines chief executive. He added they aren’t certain where precisely they are atop Mons Mouton at the moon’s south pole.“We did see some noise on our landing sensors toward the end,” said Tim Crain, the chief technology officer of Intuitive Machines, while emphasizing how much the spacecraft’s systems improved compared with the Odysseus mission last year. He added, “We’re trying to evaluate exactly what happened in that last bit.”“We’re excited to see what science and what technology we can do,” said Nicola Fox, the associate administrator of NASA’s science mission directorate — which means NASA is not yet sure whether Athena will be able to deploy its NASA drill, its small rovers or a rocket-powered hopping drone.In a news conference at Johnson Space Center in Houston, Steve Altemus, the chief executive of Intuitive Machines, explained that “We don’t believe we’re in the correct attitude on the surface of the moon yet again.” Basically, the Athena lander is not upright, but they don’t yet know exactly how it is oriented. The spacecraft has power and is communicating with the ground.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTNASA and Intuitive Machines are starting a news conference to provide updates on the Athena lander’s current condition. We’ll provide updates here and you can watch the news conference in our video player above.Expect more moon landings later this year.ImageThe Resilience lander from Ispace of Japan. It was launched on the same SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that sent Blue Ghost to the moon.Credit...ispace, via Associated PressAfter two landings four days apart — Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost on Sunday and Intuitive Machines’ Athena on Thursday — the parade of lunar landers will continue through the rest of the year.One of those spacecraft is already in space. The Resilience lander from Ispace of Japan was launched on the same SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that sent Blue Ghost on its way, but it is taking a longer, more fuel-efficient path to the moon. It will enter orbit around the moon around May 6 and attempt a landing a month later at Mare Frigoris, or the Sea of Cold, in the moon’s northern hemisphere.This is Ispace’s second lunar mission. The first ended in a crash in April 2023 because its navigating software misjudged the spacecraft’s altitude.In the fall, Astrobotic Technology of Pittsburgh is planning to try to get to the moon after a failure on its first attempt last year. Soon after launch, its Peregrine lander suffered a major malfunction with its propulsion system, and it was not able to get close to the moon. It burned up in Earth’s atmosphere. This time, Astrobotic will launch its bigger lander, known as Griffin. The mission was to carry NASA’s Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, or VIPER, but last year NASA announced that because of cost overruns, it planned to cancel the mission and disassemble the rover. NASA said that it would still pay Astrobotic $323 million for the Griffin mission but that the lander would simply carry a dummy weight instead as a demonstration of Griffin’s capabilities.NASA is now soliciting proposals for other ways to get VIPER to the moon, while Astrobotic has secured a contract to deliver a different rover, a commercial design by Lunar Outpost of Golden, Colo., to the moon.Also in the fall, Intuitive Machines is hoping to launch its third mission for NASA. That mission is to investigate Reiner Gamma, a geological feature where the moon has a fairly strong but local magnetic field.The most intriguing lander is the one planned by Blue Origin, the rocket company started by Jeff Bezos. The lander, known as Blue Moon Mark 1, will be the largest spacecraft ever to set down on the moon, even larger than the ones that took NASA astronauts to the moon during the Apollo moon landings more than 50 years ago.This Blue Moon lander is not designed to carry people, but it will test systems for a forthcoming version of the spacecraft that is to be used to take NASA astronauts to the surface of the moon during the Artemis V mission, currently scheduled for 2030.Before the debut launch of Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket in January, Dave Limp, the company’s chief executive, said Blue Moon Mark 1 remained on target to launch this year.NASA just said in an update on X that the Athena lander “touched down on the Moon at approximately 12:30 pm ET.” But they didn’t give additional details about the status of the spacecraft, or how the outcome of the landing will affect deployment of its science experiments. The news conference at 4 p.m. Eastern time remains on schedule.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe struggles of other spacecraft that shared Athena’s launch to space.ImageThe Athena lander being encapsulated with three other spacecraft on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.Credit...NASA, via Associated PressThe Athena lander didn’t go to space by itself. Three other spacecraft shared the trip to orbit on Feb. 26 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. And at least two of those vehicles have joined the Intuitive Machines robot in having an uncertain ultimate fate after detaching from the rocket.One of those spacecraft, Odin, is essentially lost to its creators on Earth, according to an update published on Thursday by AstroForge, a private company from California that built the robotic vehicle.It had the goal of flying past a near-Earth asteroid and beaming back imagery that would help the company assess whether the space rock would be a good candidate for mining valuable metals. Odin is about the size of a microwave and was built in less than 10 months at a cost of $3.5 million, according to the company.AstroForge began struggling to communicate with the spacecraft soon after it separated from the rocket, blaming problems with ground systems. As of Thursday, Odin was about 270,000 miles from Earth and beyond the moon, and its precise location in space was growing increasingly uncertain, making it more difficult to re-establish contact, the company said.The company said it would apply what it learned from the mission as it builds its next spacecraft, an asteroid lander named Vestri.“This is a new frontier, and we get another shot at it with Vestri,” Matthew Gialich, the company’s chief executive, said in a post on X.The second struggling spacecraft is a NASA mission, Lunar Trailblazer. It aimed to orbit the moon and help scientists develop a detailed water map of the lunar surface. The robotic orbiter was part of NASA’s Small, Innovative Missions for Planetary Exploration program, or SIMPLEX, a series of lower-cost, higher-risk science missions. This one cost about $100 million.But the night after the launch, NASA announced that it had lost contact with the spacecraft following “intermittent power system issues.” NASA is continuing efforts to get control of Lunar Trailblazer, but a Tuesday update did not sound promising. The agency described the spacecraft as likely spinning slowly without enough energy to operate its higher-power systems.The third spacecraft was CHIMERA GEO 1 from Epic Aerospace of San Francisco. It was designed to put small satellites in distant orbits. The company has provided no public updates about the vehicle since the launch and did not respond to an email or a LinkedIn message seeking comment.Why it’s easier to fall down on the moon.ImageAn animation simulated the Intuitive Machines lander on its approach to the moon on Thursday.Credit...NASA TVThe basic physics is simple: Something that is short and squat is less likely to tip over than something tall and skinny, like the design of the Intuitive Machines’ lunar landers.The company’s first lander, Odysseus, tipped over when it landed while moving too fast horizontally along a 12-degree slope in February 2024. Just a month earlier, a Japanese spacecraft called SLIM had also tipped over.Mission controllers at Intuitive Machines’ operations center in Houston are trying to figure out the orientation of Athena, the company’s second lander, after it arrived on the moon on Thursday. Could it also have tipped over?Last year, Philip Metzger, a former NASA engineer who is now a planetary scientist at the University of Central Florida, explained why a spacecraft is more likely to tip on the moon than on Earth if it is still moving sideways when it touches the ground.He gave the example of trying to push over the refrigerator in your kitchen. “It’s so heavy that a slight push is not going to push it over,” Dr. Metzger said.But if you replace it with a piece of Styrofoam in the shape of a refrigerator, mimicking the weight of a real refrigerator in lunar gravity, “then a very light push will push it over,” Dr. Metzger said.Assuming the spacecraft remains in one piece, it would rotate at the point of contact where the landing foot touches the ground.Dr. Metzger’s calculations suggested that for the landing, legs needed to be splayed out about 2.5 times as wide in order to counteract the same amount of sideways motion.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTShares of Intuitive Machines, which went public in 2023, tumbled after reports that its spacecraft’s condition is uncertain. Its stock is down about 20 percent today as investors anxiously await the company’s news conference scheduled for later this afternoon.Why NASA is trying to go back to the moon.ImagePresident Trump with a toy astronaut during a signing ceremony for the Space Policy Directive 1 on Dec. 11, 2017.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesNASA is aiming to send astronauts back to the moon, because that is what President Trump set as the destination of the agency’s human spaceflight program during his first term.On Dec. 11, 2017, Mr. Trump signed what the White House called Space Policy Directive 1, which stated that “the United States will lead the return of humans to the Moon for long-term exploration and utilization, followed by human missions to Mars and other destinations.”The people attending Mr. Trump’s signing of the directive included Buzz Aldrin, the second person to step on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission after Neil Armstrong, and Harrison Schmitt, an astronaut on Apollo 17, the last time people were on the moon.Three reasons are often offered for NASA to send astronauts back to the moon:Much knowledge about the solar system can be gleaned from the moon, especially in the eternally shadowed craters in the polar regions that appear to hold frozen water.The moon is the logical next stop for astronauts.The United States needs to get back to the moon before China gets there.For a couple of decades after the Apollo moon landings, not many people paid much attention to the moon. The moon was a “been there, done that” place, a lifeless, airless world of rocks and dust and not much else. Scientists and NASA looked to explore Mars and other planets.The discovery of frozen water in the craters rekindled interest in the moon.Moon water could simplify astronaut missions going there. Humans need to drink water to survive, and water molecules can be split into hydrogen and oxygen. Oxygen provides air to breathe, and hydrogen and oxygen can also be used as rocket propellants to return home to Earth, or to travel elsewhere in the solar system.Layers of ice in the craters could also provide a history of the solar system, much as ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica provide a record of Earth’s climate.Spacecraft like Athena, the Intuitive Machines mission whose fate was uncertain after a moon landing attempt on Thursday, aim to advance those goals.The rapid rise of China’s space program has also set the stage for a new space race. At the Commercial Space Conference in Washington in February, Bruce Babin, a Texas congressman who is chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, raised the specter of “No trespassing” signs on the moon written in Chinese.“My top priority is ensuring that U.S. astronauts return to the lunar surface and that we do so before the C.C.P.,” Mr. Babin said, using the initials for Chinese Communist Party.Whether Mr. Trump still wants to go to the moon is less certain.During his campaign, his inaugural address in January and his address to Congress this week, Mr. Trump has mentioned planting a U.S. flag on Mars. He almost never talks about the moon anymore.Elon Musk, the chief executive of SpaceX and a key adviser to Mr. Trump, says the moon is a distraction, even though SpaceX has a multibillion-dollar NASA contract to build the landers that are to take astronauts to the moon’s surface as part of the Artemis program.NASA and Intuitive Machines ended their broadcast with a cliffhanger. Athena is on the moon but mission controllers are still trying to figure out its condition.Updates may come from the company’s X account, or a news conference that is scheduled for 4 p.m. Eastern time. We’ll bring you more news as we learn what’s going on.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe design of Athena is tall and narrow while the Blue Ghost lander from Firefly Aerospace that landed on Sunday is short and squat. The shape of the Intuitive Machines spacecraft has raised concerns that it is more likely to tip over.Update from Tim Crain, the mission director: “All right, team, keep working the problem. We’re shedding power as fast as we can to keep the vehicle in good health. We are generating power. We are communicating through our telemetry radio, and we are working to evaluate exactly what our orientation is on the surface.”Tim Crain said there are pictures from Athena that mission controllers will use to better understand the spacecraft’s condition.The fact that they are getting data from the spacecraft indicates that it did not crash.However, the spacecraft is not quite working as expected.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAthena may be on the surface and the mission controllers are performing tasks like turning off the engine as if it has indeed landed.On the livestream, several pictures recorded during the descent to the lunar surface were shown.Last year, there was also a long wait to hear from the spacecraft on the surface.One radio on the spacecraft is working. The engine appears to be firing. The situation is confusing.The landing time has passed. Mission controllers are trying to figure out what happened.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe final engine burn, to slow down the spacecraft from 4,000 miles per hour and guide it to the landing site, has begun.Athena is bringing wheels and deals to the moon’s surface.ImageLunar Outpost’s Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform, or MAPP, is about the largest of three rovers on this mission and it is scheduled to start rolling on Thursday evening.Credit...Lunar OutpostAthena is carrying not one, not two, but three robotic rovers.Interestingly, NASA did not directly pay for any of them. Instead, they are the result of the intertwined business relationships on this mission.What NASA did pay for was a project proposed by Nokia, the Finnish telecommunications company, to demonstrate that the same 4G LTE technology that connects cellphones on Earth could also be deployed on the moon.“You need advanced communication capabilities, and why not leverage the technologies that we have developed on Earth?” said Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs solution research at Nokia. To test that technology on this mission, Nokia needed a way to move at least one of the antennas some distance away from Athena, which won’t move again after it lands. So Nokia hired Lunar Outpost of Colorado to build an antenna-carrying rover.The Lunar Outpost vehicle, called the Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform, or MAPP, is about the size of a small dog. It is the largest of the three rovers and it is scheduled to start rolling on Thursday evening.“We actually make profit by sending this rover to the moon, which is a pretty awesome thing, right?” said Justin Cyrus, the founder and chief executive of Lunar Outpost. “It’s not something that really could have existed 10 or 15 years ago.”Part of Lunar Outpost’s revenue comes from Nokia, which pays to transport the antenna away from the lander, which serves as the cell network tower. But the MAPP rover is large enough to carry other payloads as well, and Lunar Outpost sold that space to other customers, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.M.I.T. is sending a small rover called AstroAnt that is about the size of a Hot Wheels toy car. It will drive around on the top flat surface of MAPP, measuring the temperature of the larger rover and communicating via a wireless Bluetooth connection.M.I.T. researchers envision that swarms of AstroAnts could be used to perform various tasks in space.The third rover, Yaoki from Dymon Co., Ltd. of Japan, is also one of the commercial payloads on the Athena lander.Yaoki, which is a bit bigger than a Mac mini computer, will operate separately from the MAPP rover and test Dymon’s technology on the moon. It is scheduled to be deployed next week.A robot will make a hop, a skip and a jump on the moon’s surface.ImageIntuitive Machines’s Micro Nova Hopper is nicknamed Grace, after Grace Hopper, the pioneering 20th century computer scientist and mathematician who became a rear admiral in the United States Navy, seen here in 1984.Credit...Cynthia Johnson/Getty ImagesFor years, Mark Robinson, a professor of planetary geosciences at Arizona State University, imagined a tiny little spacecraft that could hop into a hole or pit on the moon’s surface, take a quick look around and hop back out.Planetary scientists speculated that such pits could be an opening into a lava tube — a hollow underground channel where lava once flowed, and where astronauts could someday build a moon base.Dr. Robinson mentioned his idea to Trent Martin, senior vice president for space systems at Intuitive Machines.Mr. Martin told Dr. Robinson that Intuitive Machines was developing a flying vehicle that could undertake exactly that type of lunar spelunking.“Everyone was doing rovers, and we started thinking about ways that we could do extreme mobility, down into locations where rovers could not reach,” Mr. Martin said.NASA liked the hopper idea and awarded money to Intuitive Machines to build it and put it on Athena. But the destination for this mission is the south polar region and not close to a pit. Dr. Robinson, who now works for Intuitive Machines, will have to wait longer for his original inspiration to come to fruition.Instead, the 2.5-foot-tall flying vehicle is to go into a permanently shadowed region that never receives direct sunshine.Formally, Intuitive Machines calls it the Micro Nova Hopper. It also nicknamed this particular vehicle Grace, after Grace Hopper, a pioneering 20th century computer scientist and mathematician who became a rear admiral in the United States Navy.About 14 hours after Athena’s arrival, the hopper will hop about 20 yards from the lander. That will be followed by a longer hop, about 50 yards. Then the hopper will perform a longer, more level flight at an altitude of about 300 feet to the edge of a small, shadowed crater. It will hop into the crater, about 60 feet deep, and hop out again.The hopper is carrying cameras, a thermometer and an instrument to sniff for water. It is also carrying an antenna to help test Nokia’s cellphone network technology for communications between the hopper, the lander and a separate rover.For future missions, a hopper could serve a reconnaissance role, similar to how, on Mars, NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter surveyed the terrain ahead of the Perseverance rover. It could also dive into one of the moon’s mysterious pits.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Décollage!” is what they say in French Guiana when launching rockets for Europe’s space program. The Ariane 6 rocket lifted off on time at 11:24 a.m. Eastern time. The rocket’s upper stage is now coasting in orbit ahead of the deployment of the French military satellite it is carrying. VideoCreditCredit...ReutersThis is what will happen when Athena tries to land on the moon.ImageA view from Athena released Tuesday, passing over its landing spot. It has been orbiting the moon every two hours, waiting for the sun to rise on the intended landing site at Mons Mouton.Credit...Intuitive MachinesThe Athena lander entered orbit around the moon on Monday. It has since been circling the moon at an altitude of 62 miles.While the spacecraft is over the far side of the moon, its main engine will fire briefly, causing it to start descending to the moon’s surface. From that point on, Athena will be on its own, relying on its own software to guide it safely to the ground. At Intuitive Machines in Houston, mission controllers will only be able to watch what happens.The lander will coast on this elliptical orbit, heading toward a low point of 6.2 miles above the surface, for about one hour.Then the engine will start firing again for the final approach.The spacecraft will use cameras to identify craters and other landmarks on the lunar terrain, information it will use to determine its location. Lasers aboard Athena will bounce off the surface to tell the craft how high up it is.As it approaches the landing site, Athena will pivot to a vertical position, using sensors to look for a safe place to land — a flat area without boulders or other hazards.At an altitude of about 18 miles above the landing site, Athena will descend vertically at about seven miles per hour. About 30 feet above the surface, it will slow even more, to a bit more than two miles per hour.For the final part of the descent, the spacecraft will rely on sensors measuring its acceleration, and not on the lasers or the cameras, so it will not be confused by dust kicked up by the engine’s exhaust.Those sensors should record a gentle bump when Athena lands.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA drill is the Athena lander’s key cargo.ImageA team of engineers from NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston and Honeybee Robotics in Altadena, California inspecting the TRIDENT drill shortly after its arrival at the integration and test facility.Credit...Robert Markowitz/NASAMuch of the moon’s frozen water is likely below the surface, out of view of orbiting spacecraft.A drill on Athena will give scientists a first look at that water. The mission is named Polar Resources Ice Mining Experiment 1, or PRIME-1. The drill is named The Regolith and Ice Drill for Exploring New Terrain, or TRIDENT.Near the south pole where temperatures are very cold, volatiles — chemical substances that easily change into a gas — are likely to be trapped in the soil.The volatiles would give clues about the origin of the solar system, and they could also provide key resources for future astronauts, including water to drink, air to breathe and rocket fuel.“It’s going to be important to understand, on the surface of the moon and beneath the surface, where these volatiles are, exactly what they are,” Joel Kearns, the deputy associate administrator for exploration in NASA’s science mission directorate, said during a news conference in February.The drill was built by Honeybee Robotics of Altadena, Calif. It can drill to a depth of one meter.When penetrating through loose soil, the drill bit turns like a normal drill. But the drill also has a mode that behaves more like a jackhammer “that we can turn on whenever we hit rocks or we hit ice,” Kris Zacny, vice president for exploration systems at Honeybee, said in an interview. “Frozen ground is as hard as pavement and even harder.”The drill cuttings will be lifted out from the drill hole about four inches at a time and dumped on the lunar surface. The volatiles lurking in those cuttings, including water and carbon dioxide, will turn into gases and be detected by a mass spectrometer. The drill also has two temperature sensors. One is the located right at the drill bit. The second, along with a heater, is eight inches above the drill bit. The heater also serves as a science experiment, allowing measurements of the flow of heat between the two sensors, which could reveal how much frozen water is in the lunar dirt.If the soil is a good thermal conductor, heat from the heater would not change the temperature much. That is what would be expected if there is ice in the soil — what planetary scientists call regolith.“But if the lunar regolith is a very good insulator and we turn the heater on, the temperature is going to go up very, very quickly because there is nowhere for heat to go,” Dr. Zacny said.The thermal conductivity will be low if the regolith is dry.The amount of power needed to push the drill downward will also reveal something about the material, whether it is loosely compacted soil or something hard like rock or ice.",

So Nokia hired Lunar Outpost of Colorado to build an antenna-carrying rover.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Lunar Outpost vehicle, called the Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform, or MAPP, is about the size of a small dog. It is the largest of the three rovers and it is scheduled to start rolling on Thursday evening.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We actually make profit by sending this rover to the moon, which is a pretty awesome thing, right?” said Justin Cyrus, the founder and chief executive of Lunar Outpost. “It’s not something that really could have existed 10 or 15 years ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePart of Lunar Outpost’s revenue comes from Nokia, which pays to transport the antenna away from the lander, which serves as the cell network tower. But the MAPP rover is large enough to carry other payloads as well, and Lunar Outpost sold that space to other customers, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eM.I.T. is sending a small rover called AstroAnt that is about the size of a Hot Wheels toy car.

That will be followed by a longer hop, about 50 yards. Then the hopper will perform a longer, more level flight at an altitude of about 300 feet to the edge of a small, shadowed crater.

It can drill to a depth of one meter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen penetrating through loose soil, the drill bit turns like a normal drill. But the drill also has a mode that behaves more like a jackhammer “that we can turn on whenever we hit rocks or we hit ice,” Kris Zacny, vice president for exploration systems at Honeybee, said in an interview. “Frozen ground is as hard as pavement and even harder.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe drill cuttings will be lifted out from the drill hole about four inches at a time and dumped on the lunar surface.

One is the located right at the drill bit. The second, along with a heater, is eight inches above the drill bit.
