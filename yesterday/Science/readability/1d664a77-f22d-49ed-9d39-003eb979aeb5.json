  "text": "Elon Musk’s brain implant company, Neuralink, announced on Tuesday that it is launching a study to test its implant for a new use: allowing a person to control a robotic arm using just their thoughts. “We’re excited to announce the approval and launch of a new feasibility trial to extend BCI control using the N1 implant to an investigational assistive robotic arm,” Neuralink said in a post on Musk’s social media platform X.A BCI, or brain-computer interface, is a system that allows a person to directly control outside devices with their brain waves. It works by reading and decoding intended movement signals from neurons. Neuralink’s BCI involves a coin-sized device dubbed N1 that is surgically implanted in the brain by a robot. The company is currently evaluating the safety of its BCI, as well as its ability to control a computer in individuals with paralysis.Moving a computer or prosthetic arm is not a new feat for BCIs. In 2008, a team led by Andrew Schwartz at the University of Pittsburgh showed that a monkey could control a robotic arm to feed itself using signals from its brain. After that, researchers moved on to human volunteers. In a 2012 study published in the journal Nature, two people paralyzed due to stroke were able to guide a robotic arm to reach and grasp objects simply by thinking about it. One was able to serve herself coffee for the first time in 14 years. In another study from 2016, a man with a BCI regained a sense of touch using a robotic arm.The BCIs used in those studies were clunky setups that required running a cable from the research participants’ head to a computer that decodes brain signals. By contrast, Neuralink’s system is wireless.On social media earlier this year, Neuralink demonstrated that its BCI can be used to control a computer cursor. In a video on X, study participant Noland Arbaugh was shown using the Neuralink device to play chess and other games on a computer. Arbaugh, who became a quadriplegic after a swimming accident in 2016, spoke with WIRED earlier this year about how the implant has given him a sense of independence.Arbaugh underwent brain surgery in January to receive the Neuralink implant, but a few weeks later, the device started to malfunction. The implant has 64 thin, flexible wire threads that penetrate the brain tissue. Each thread contains 16 electrodes that collect neural signals. In a blog post from May, Neuralink said several threads had retracted from Arbaugh’s brain, causing him to temporarily lose cursor control. Neuralink was able to restore Arbaugh’s control by modifying its brain recording algorithm to be more sensitive and changing how it translates neural signals into cursor movements.Neuralink’s second participant, Alex, received the implant in July. In a company update issued prior to the surgery, Neuralink executives said they took steps to reduce the likelihood of thread retraction, including reducing brain motion during the surgery and reducing the gap between the implant and the surface of the brain.The new robotic arm study, according to the Neuralink post on X, “will enable cross-enrolling participants from the ongoing PRIME Study.” No additional details about the robotic arm study are available yet on Neuralink’s website or clinicaltrials.gov, an online repository of medical studies involving human participants.“We congratulate Neuralink on receiving approval for their feasibility trial,” says Marcus Gerhardt, CEO and cofounder of Blackrock Neurotech, the company that manufactures the Utah array, the brain implant used in previous studies of mind-controlled robotic limbs. “Every advancement in neurotechnology moves us closer to empowering individuals with neurological disorders.”Brian Dekleva, a research scientist at the Rehab Neural Engineering Labs at the University of Pittsburgh, says the biggest challenge in achieving BCI control of an assistive robotic arm is the need for calibration. “The more complicated the control, the more degrees of freedom you add, the longer the calibration is going to take in general,” he says. “People don't want to sit and do a half-hour calibration at the beginning of each day so that they can use their device.”If that limitation can be overcome, BCIs that control robotic arms could allow people with paralysis to carry out simple daily tasks without assistance.",
