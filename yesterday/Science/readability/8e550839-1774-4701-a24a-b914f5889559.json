We are there, too! Just look for This Week in Science! Disclaimer, Disclaimer, Disclaimer!!! The disclaimer you would normally hear in this segment Something about the importance of science in society Yadda yadda Has been replaced. As of the airing of this broadcast… The US government has incarcerated a student for practicing free speech on a university campus. Mahmoud Khalil was actively involved in protesting the war on GAZA at Columbia University last year. His green card, which was in good standing, was revoked and Khalil was sent to a detention center in Jena, Louisiana, presumably for being in the country illegally… though it was seemingly only revoked in order to arrest him. The reason he was sent to a detention center in Jena, Louisiana, not New York where he was arrested… likely a form of federal judge shopping, courts being more conservative there…. But it also takes Khalil far from friends, family, and lawyers… making his defense more difficult. America… students, citizens, visitors from abroad… we warned This is a violation of everything we hold sacred. This is not law enforcement. This is government opinion enforced by force. This is exactly what tyranny looks like. And it does not happen in a free country. With that, I now bring us back to This Week in Science! Sharing our Knowledge of this week’s science news!
