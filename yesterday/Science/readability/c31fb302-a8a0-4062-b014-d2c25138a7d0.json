  "description": "I was in Chicago this weekend attending the ASCO meeting, the largest oncology meeting in the world. Nary a talk or poster about \"turbo cancer\" was seen, but that doesn't mean there wasn't cancer quack fight online to distract me from the meeting. The post No turbo cancer at ASCO: William Makis vs. Scott Adams and A Midwestern Doctor instead? first appeared on Science-Based Medicine.",
