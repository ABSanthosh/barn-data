Lawrence Edwards, a climate scientist at the University of Minnesota. Edwards was awarded a National Medal of Science for his work on reconstructing the planet’s climate history dating back to the prehistoric ages.“Lawrence Edward’s innovative research methods shed light on the rate, scale and drivers of climate change and the impact on human civilization, defining him as one of the most celebrated earth scientists of our time,” Koizumi said.G. David Tilman, an ecologist at the University of Minnesota, also received a National Medal of Science for his research on biodiversity and conservation, including the ways that the planet’s diversity of life helps bolster ecosystems against environmental disturbances like climate change.“David Tilman’s work proves the extraordinary variety of life that exists on Earth is essential to productive ecosystems, sustainable agriculture, renewable energy and more, helping to feed and power the world while making conservation both a strategic and moral calling,” Koizumi said.Altogether, the White House awarded 14 National Medals of Science and 11 National Medals of Technology and Innovation.“This year’s honorees represent a simple truth as I’ve always believed. America can be defined by a single word: possibilities,” Biden said at the ceremony on Friday. “That’s who we are: a nation of possibilities.”Reprinted from E\u0026E News with permission from POLITICO, LLC.
