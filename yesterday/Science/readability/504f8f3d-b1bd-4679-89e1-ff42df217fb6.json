  "text": "Hi all. Nathan here. This is the Process, the newsletter for FlowingData members on making sense of data and visualizing the insights clearly. One of the best and most direct ways to do this is to ask questions and answer with data. The former provides a path to explore, and the latter helps define how to visualize your data. To access this issue of The Process, you must be a member. (If you are already a member, log in here.) The Process is a weekly newsletter on how visualization tools, rules, and guidelines work in practice. I publish every Thursday. Get it in your inbox or read it on FlowingData. You also gain unlimited access to hundreds of hours worth of step-by-step visualization courses and tutorials, which will help you make sense of data for insight and presentation. Resources include source code and datasets so that you can more easily apply what you learn in your own work. Your support keeps the rest of FlowingData open and assures the data keeps flowing freely.",
