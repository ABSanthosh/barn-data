  "description": "\"Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans.\" It's been 45 years since John Lennon sang that line, yet it's an idea that continues to speak to an uncomfortable truth. While we all like to think we have some measure of control over how our lives will unfold, our plans are often upended by unknown events and curveballs we couldn't have predicted. This week, we conclude our Wellness 2.0 series by talking with political scientist Brian Klaas. He studies how we respond to the random events that shape our lives, and how we can turn them to our advantage.If you enjoy this episode, be sure to check out \"Wellness 2.0: Engineering Luck,\" our companion conversation with Brian Klass for Hidden Brain+ subscribers.
