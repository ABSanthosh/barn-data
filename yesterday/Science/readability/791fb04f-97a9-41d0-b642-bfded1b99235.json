Credit...Jason Andrew for The New York TimesPublished March 8, 2025Updated March 9, 2025, 1:45 p.m. ETShortly before noon on Friday, Dr. Francis Collins, the former director of the National Institutes of Health, stood on the steps below the Lincoln Memorial tuning his acoustic guitar — a “very sweet” Huss \u0026 Dalton, he said, with a double-helix of DNA winding down the neck in pearl inlay. The nation’s anxious scientists could use a song.Dr. Collins, a biomedical researcher renowned for leading the Human Genome Project in the 1990s, had steered the N.I.H. through three presidencies, into 2021, and continued working at the agency until his abrupt retirement a week ago. Now he was a headline speaker for Stand Up for Science, a rally to protest the Trump administration’s drastic cuts to the federal work force and to federally funded science.The organizers weren’t sure how many people would show up — they later estimated that the crowd had peaked at 5,000 — nor quite what to expect. In 2017, tens of thousands gathered on the Washington Mall for the March for Science. The collective mood then was as much perplexity as defiance at Mr. Trump’s suggestions that America could be made greater by greatly reducing the Environmental Protection Agency and perhaps never mentioning climate change ever again.This year’s crowd was met by Lincoln, over-large and stone-faced in his chair. The organizers had chosen the site for its postcard view of Capitol Hill, perhaps less aware that the 16th president was a champion of science. He established the National Academy of Sciences in 1863 and, an avid astronomer, often visited the Naval Observatory. Early in his career, Lincoln often carried a volume of Euclid under his arm; he studied the mathematician’s argumentative logic to hone his own as a lawyer.ImageDr. Francis Collins, former director of the National Institutes of Health, invoked the Gettysburg Address — “of the people, by the people, for the people” — and noted that it applied to taxpayer-funded science, too. “We have to sing about this,” he said.Credit...Eric Lee/The New York TimesImageA scientific S.O.S.Credit...Jason Andrew for The New York TimesImageBeaker, the Muppet lab assistant.Credit...Jason Andrew for The New York TimesThank you for your patience while we verify access.
