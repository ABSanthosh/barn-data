In the summer of 2023, Bulgaria experienced numerous heatwaves, leading to the country experiencing one of the highest rates of heat mortality in Europe. But how are these numbers calculated? How exactly does heat affect us? Who is most likely to suffer from ill health due to heat? And how can we protect ourselves in an increasingly warming world? Along with a panel of experts, Claudia Hammond will explore these questions and more with a live audience at the Sofia Science Festival in Bulgaria. Are we prepared for how rising temperatures will affect our health? This programme aims to find out.",

Scientists are researching creatures such as “immortal” jellyfish and long-lived tortoises and digging deep into genetic codes to figure out why animals age—and what we can do to improve longevity in humans.

    "description": "Five centuries ago, before Spanish conquistadors arrived, what's now Mexico City was the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan—and it took the European invaders' breath away. It was built on an island threaded with canals; it was one of the largest cities in the world; and the Spanish could hardly believe the sheer volume of food sold in the city's main market, let alone the quantity and variety of dishes enjoyed by the Aztec leader, Montezuma. But how did a city built in a lake—and located in a part of the world without cows, sheep, pigs, or chicken—grow enough to feed quarter of a million people? What does it mean to eat like an Aztec, and can you still do it today? This episode, we're time traveling (and real traveling) to find out! Join us on a trip to taste the flavors of Tenochtitlan, and explore the endangered “floating islands” that fed the city—with a menu that included insect eggs, blue-green algae, and some adorable salamanders that just might hold the secret of eternal youth.

    "description": "Scientists have discovered a giant planet orbiting a tiny red dwarf star, something they believed wasn t even possible. The planet, TOI-6894b, is about the size of Saturn but orbits a star just a fifth the mass of our Sun. This challenges long-standing ideas about how big planets form, especially around small stars. Current theories can't fully explain how such a planet could have taken shape. Even more fascinating, this cold planet may have a rare kind of atmosphere rich in methane or even ammonia something we've never seen in an exoplanet before.",

    "description": "A team of scientists has identified specialized neurons in the brain that store \"meal memories\" detailed recollections of when and what we eat. These engrams, found in the ventral hippocampus, help regulate eating behavior by communicating with hunger-related areas of the brain. When these memory traces are impaired due to distraction, brain injury, or memory disorders individuals are more likely to overeat because they can't recall recent meals. The research not only uncovers a critical neural mechanism but also suggests new strategies for treating obesity by enhancing memory around food consumption.",

Starting with an ingredient in breastmilk that babies can’t digest, a global hunt that takes us from Bangladesh to the Mennonite communities here in the US, we discover an ancient symbiotic relationship that might be on the verge of disappearing.  So sip a vicarious cocktail, settle in, and explore the surprising ways our bodies forge deep, invisible connections that shape our lives.This live show is part of a series we are doing with Avir that we are calling “Viscera.” Each event is conversation that takes the audience on journey into a quirk or question or mystery inside of us, and gives them a visceral experience with the viscera of us. The previous installment of the series, was called “How to Save a Life.”Special thanks to Tim Brown, David Mills, Carlito Lebrilla, Bethany Henrik, Danielle Lemay, Katie Hinde, Jennifer Smilowitz, Angela Zivkovic, Daniela Barile, Mark UnderwoodEPISODE CREDITS:Reported by -Avir Mitrawith help from - Anisa VietzeOriginal music from - Dylan KeefeSound design contributed by - Dylan Keefe, Ivan BarenFact-checking by -Natalie Middleton.Signup for our newsletter!!

In this episode, first aired more than a decade ago, Jim Eggers is a 44-year-old man who suffers from a problem that not only puts his life at risk—it jeopardizes the safety of everybody around him. But with the help of Sadie, his pet African Grey Parrot, Jim found an unlikely way to manage his anger. African Grey Parrot expert Irene Pepperberg helps us understand how this could work, and shares some insights from her work with a parrot named Alex.And one quick note from our producer Pat Walters: Jim considers Sadie to be a “service animal,” a designation under the Americans with Disabilities Act that protects the rights of individuals with disabilities to bring certain animals into public places. The term service animal sometimes is legally limited to include only dogs and miniature horses. Jim disagrees with those limitations, but the local bus company, regardless of definitions, said they’ll make an exception for Sadie.",

Some say these cute, white pups are not really dire wolves, but that didn't stop a huge media buzz. One of the wolves even made the cover of TIME Magazine … with the line \"He's a dire wolf. The first to exist in 10,000 years. Endangered species could be changed forever.\"  So, what exactly is going on here? Who is this company? And, is this a good idea or could it have dire consequences??   This story comes to us from our friends at Vox's Today, Explained. Transcript: https://bit.ly/ScienceVsTodayExplainedDireWolves  In this episode, we cover: (00:00) Meet the pups (02:06) Did we really bring back the dire wolf? (14:34) Should we be doing this?  This episode was produced by Devan Schwartz, edited by Jolie Myers, fact-checked by Laura Bullard, engineered by Andrea Kristinsdottir and Patrick Boyd, and hosted by Sean Rameswaram.

    "description": "In 2020, Scientific American made waves with the provocative headline: \"No One Can Explain Why Planes Stay in the Air.\" But is that really true? Dr. Graham Wild, senior lecturer in aviation science and technology at the University of New South Wales in Canberra, joins us to set the record straight. In this episode, we dip our toes into the complex world of flight. We scratch at the very surface of the topic in an episode that could easily take over 20 hours.

    "description": "Most of us throw our clothes in the wash without a second thought, but what if that habit is doing more harm than good? In this episode, Dr. Holly Kaye-Smith, social change expert and communications specialist, challenges the way we think about cleanliness, climate action, and everyday laundry. From surprising stats (over 90% of washed clothes aren’t even dirty!) to the hidden environmental cost of every wash cycle, we dive into the myths, microplastics, and mindsets that shape our laundering routines. Holly shares practical refreshing techniques that save water, and why she recommends everyone have a “rewear chair.” Connect with Dr Holly Kaye Smith on Linkedin Instagram - www.instagram.com/drhollyphd/ Youtube -  www.youtube.com/@drhollyphd",

How do trees achieve the optimal distribution of leaves and why are tortoise shells so geometrically exciting?Plus we learn why the cheetah got its spots, thanks to the work of Thomas Woolley’s mathematical hero, Alan Turing, how numbers can be more or less irrational, and why Dave Gorman has a vendetta against oblongs.

    "description": "Brian Cox and Robin Ince explore the history of music recording, joined by acoustics professor Trevor Cox, music professor Sam Bennett and musician and producer Brian Eno. Together they guide us through the evolution of sound recording, a space in which technology hasn’t stood still since its advent in the mid-1800s. We hear the very first recognisable recording of a voice made with a brush making marks in soot and put a spotlight on the Fairlight CMI, a revolutionary digital synthesizer of the '70s, used in Brian’s records (Cox \u0026 Eno’s!)Plus, we run an audio experiment with our live audience who turn themselves into our in-house digital orchestra, with the help of their mobile phones. Now that lots of people have several devices that can play sound, new technology is harnessing this to create a more immersive experience – which (kind of) worked in our experiment!Producer: Melanie Brown Exec Producer: Alexandra Feachem Assistant Producer: Olivia Jani",
