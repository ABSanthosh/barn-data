    "description": "Snake Plotzkin Reviews THE LIFE AND DEATHS OF CHRISTOPHER LEE Read the full article on AICN Snake Plotzkin, reporting from Fantastic Fest 2024, where I got to see the biographical documentary, The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee. I’m a big fan of Hammer horror, and I will watch literally any Hammer film with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in it. One of my favorite Hammer films is Rasputin the Mad Monk, which, if you haven’t seen it, is one of Lee’s best performances. The gigantically tall Lee stalks around St. Peterburg as the mad monk, hypnotizing women, seducing them, and then yelling at them to get out of his room and leave their money on the bed. It’s amazing.  If The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee had been made up completely of anecdotes about Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing on the Hammer films, I would honestly have been very satisfied with it. But the movie unexpectedly goes much further, revealing not just another side of the actor, but multiple facets. For instance, did you know that Christopher Lee fought Nazis? That he may have been the inspiration for James Bond (which was written by his cousin)? That he released two heavy metal albums? Well, this movie goes where no marionette-narrated biopic has gone before, using a mix of interviews, animation, and puppetry to bring Christopher Lee to life (the man himself passed away in 2015). Yes, I said puppetry. The movie is narrated by a marionette of Christopher Lee – who, in an uncanny imitation of Lee’s sonorous voice (played by Peter Szymon Serafinowicz, an English actor Finish the article on AICN",

Barbarella here. Strange Harvest: The Occult Murder in the Inland Empire is a long title for a great narrative utilizing the true-crime documentary format. The format proves so effective at tricking my brain into thinking I’m watching actual footage of crime scenes and caught-on-tape moments that I had to occasionally remind myself to relax, it’s only a movie.  It made its world premiere at Fantastic Fest 2024 on September 22, 2024 at 11:50 p.m. CT, and I had the delightful opportunity to sit down with genre director Stuart Ortiz, and actors Peter Zisso and Terri Apple in Austin last week. Check it out! Barbara: I'm one of these people that I can watch the most gruesome stuff in movies, and it doesn't bother me, heads getting drilled and stuff. Peter: Bless You.  Barbara: But it really upsets me to see people getting hurt, even these skateboarding videos and such, and this movie messed with my brain because I knew it’s fictional, but my brain got tricked into thinking it was real at times because the way it was done. I'm very impressed with the effectiveness of that.  Stuart: Thank you.   Barbara: Why do this in a true crime format? What were you going for?  Stuart: I just think it's a really interesting way to tell a story, and in particular to tell a horror story because it just allows you to have this vantage point that you don't normally have with horror, to investigate certain details or aspects of a horror story that you wouldn't focus on necessarily in a more conventional story.

    "description": "Kevin Smith Talks to McEric about THE 4:30 MOVIE Read the full article on AICN Kevin Smith’s THE 4:30 MOVIE is coming home today, available on digital through all major retailers. The film tells the story of young Brian David, an avatar of Kevin Smith, and his adventures at the local Atlantic Cinema where he watches films with his friends Burny and Belly in 1986. It’s a departure from the View Askewniverse that Smith started thirty years ago, which admittedly stretched to its possible breaking point as the characters within encountered rebel angels, demons, Hollywood, jewel thieves, terrorists, and a monkey. THE 4:30 MOVIE offers a much more grounded story of a simpler time when the cinema and video store ruled the weekend, and the lives on the silver screen either mirrored our own or showed us worlds we could only imagine.  I had the opportunity to chat with Kevin Smith yesterday in support of the film’s digital release and it went exactly as I thought it would: we were given six minutes, I asked one question, and he talked for eight. What I got in that response, though, was a good deal of wisdom about what the filmmaker attempts when he puts his memories to screen for our amusement, how he’s remained relevant, and where his ideas originate. Prior to the interview’s start, my cat Bennie decided she needed to be part of it all, as well, and leapt onto the seat behind me.    Eric McClanahan - Hi Kevin!   Kevin Smith - Hello, Eric! How are you?   EM - I’m well, thank you!   KS - Look at that cat! Finish the article on AICN",

This time the terror is set against the backdrop of Christmas, with Art (David Howard Thornton) returning to hunt down Sienna (Lauren Lavera) after she cut his head off in the last installment. The film picks up right at the end of Part 2 before allowing Art to take a five year siesta while Sienna spends time in facilities piecing her psyche back together. Young Jonathan Shaw (Elliott Fullam) isn’t so young anymore, attending college near his Aunt and Uncle, Jessica and Mark (Margaret Anne Florence and Alex Ross), with whom Sienna stays after being checked out of the latest facility.  The film opens with Art dispatching a family while dressed in a Santa Claus suit, letting the audience know right away that no one is safe. The entire film plays out as a supercut of gory kills and dark humor, with occasional moments of genuine world-building that allows the supporting cast to really stretch their acting muscles. Plotwise, the film seems to be more focused on showcasing creative kills than telling a cohesive story, and the end seems somewhat rushed, as though the filmmakers had almost forgotten that they had to end the thing.    What a TERRIFIER fan is looking for, however, is exactly what they’ll find in 3: inventive kills, stomach-turning sound design, laughs that’ll make you question your own morality, and surprises.

    "description": "Barbarella Talks AI With SUBSERVIENCE Director S.K. Dale Read the full article on AICN Hi friends, Barbarella here. Sci-fi film Subservience, starring Megan Fox, Michele Morrone  (his name’s Italian so the “ch” is pronounced like a “k”), Madeline Zima, and Matilda Firth, just came out on Demand and Digital, so let’s talk about AI. Do you think artificial intelligence will bring about major medical advancements, or do you envision more of a Terminator situation evolving? I tend to think it’s not the AI itself but whoever’s behind it that should be on whom we focus our concern. When it comes to cinema, filmmakers always hold technology responsible, because let’s face it, that makes for a more entertaining movie. I would argue Will Honley and April Maguire’s screenplay puts at least some of the onus on the humans. Maybe don’t say certain things to a Sim that’s constantly evolving and learning; that’s all I’m saying. If it weren’t for one comment made to Alice (Megan Fox), the attractive Sim acquired to help out around the house, perhaps a lot of mayhem could have been avoided.    I appreciate that the conflict in Subservience primarily occurs within the family unit, as this makes it more believable to me. Favoring older technologies, Nick (Michele Morrone) isn’t the biggest fan of artificial intelligence, but when he and his sick wife (Madeline Zima) can’t keep up with managing the household and children, he caves and gets Alice, the best new Sim on the market, to help out, and you know that’s not going to work out quite how everyone expects, well, at least how everyone Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric chats with the cast of Kevin Smith's THE 4:30 MOVIE Read the full article on AICN Writer/Director Kevin Smith began his View Askewniverse in 1994 with his breakout hit CLERKS. The film tells the story of a couple of slackers working dead-end jobs in New Jersey in the 1990s and the conversations and misadventures they dabble in along the way. The film paved the way for countless stories, and so far nine films by Smith have rounded out its canon, along with several animated adventures and more in the pages of comic books. Before Dante and Randall ever sat around the Quik Stop and chatted about JAWS, STAR WARS, or even NAVY SEALS, young Kevin Smith was a New Jersey native soaking up inspiration on the silver screen at his local movie theater, the Atlantic Highlands Cinema. Flash forward to today and he owns that theater, rebranded as the Smodcastle, where he showcases new releases, repertory classics, film festivals, and even special screenings of “Movies With Kev,” where he screens a classic and participates in a Q\u0026A following the screening.   Finally the formative experiences of young Kev are getting their own film treatment, with Kevin Smith’s newest release, THE 4:30 MOVIE, premiering tomorrow in cinemas around the country. The film, not set within the View Askewniverse, tells the story of a young man named Brian David, a not-even-thinly-veiled stand-in for Kevin Smith, played by Austin Zajur, who one day in the late spring of 1986 asks his crush Melody Barnegat (Siena Agudong) to meet him at the movies.

A new Western, Place of Bones, rides into theaters and on digital Friday, August 23, 2024. Unlike the Westerns of yesteryear, this one is female-led, with Audrey Cummings in the director’s chair and Heather Graham shining in the lead role as a mother who, along with her daughter (Brielle Robillard), must fight for survival when a gang of outlaws, led by Tom Hopper, arrives in the area.    I’ve been a Tom Hopper fan ever since he won me over with his enticing portrayal of Billy Bones in Black Sails. He earns additional adoration from me through the way he injects subtle humor as villain Bear John in this film. I find myself laughing at moments that I’m fairly certain weren’t intended to be funny, yet he fires wit like a true sharp-shooter with a faint exasperation about him that’s just funny. However, he’s not the only one who offers something more than just delivering what’s written on the page. Corin Nemec, Brielle Robillard, and Heather Graham also add an extra something that gives insight into their characters and adds a bit of snark to the exchanges.   I had the opportunity to speak with Audrey Cummings, and I sometimes like to break the ice with a question about Muppet-casting on remakes.

Read the full article on AICN There was every manner of film at this year’s Tribeca Festival, and I managed to take in thirteen features, four shorts, and an episodic premiere by the time the whole thing wrapped this past June. One of the highlights was the opportunity to interview two of the lead talents behind the new slasher ALL MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD: director Marcus Dunstan and star Jade Pettyjohn. We met at the Roxy Hotel bar and restaurant, a favorite meetup spot of mine, on a Saturday morning. I was, admittedly, running late, but they were so patient and gracious with me and I always appreciate that from stars and filmmakers, whose lives are probably ten times as cluttered as mine.  Its logline says of the film: “A group of college friends rents an airbnb for the biggest music festival of the year. However, their weekend of partying soon takes a deadly turn as a masked killer murders them one by one according to their sins.” The film, though familiar in synopsis, finds a way to inject new life into a tired formula. The design of the killer is unique, the kills are creative, the victims are fighters rather than training dummies, for the most part, and the twist(s) are welcome.   Marcus Dunstan is perpetually smiling, speaking in a small voice from a large, gentle face. Jade Pettyjohn is excitable, clearly enjoying being at the festival and also talking about this joyous diversion in her filmography. We couldn’t help but jump right in.

Read the full article on AICN In some exciting news circulating the internet, it would seem that the ex-head of film at Netflix Scott Stuber is reviving the once legendary United Artists label through new partners Amazon MGM Studios. Founded in 1919 by the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickforth, D.W.Griffith and famed actor and filmmaker Douglas Fairbanks, United Artists began as a studio that would allow artists to control their own careers and artistic vision instead of being controlled by Hollywood moneymen. After decades of success, Metro Goldwyn Mayer bought the company over in 1981 for an unheard-of 350 million dollars and continued to release movies under the brand MGM/UA through the rest of the 80s, 90s and 2000s. United Artists are responsible for releasing some of the most classic movies of all time including The Mark of Zorro (1920), D.W.Griffith’s final film The Struggle (1931), The Great Dictator (1941), Alexander the Great (1956), Robert Mitchum’s Thunder Road (1958), The Magnificent Seven (1960), Dr. No (1963), Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968), Rocky (1976), Annie Hall (1977), Raging Bull (1980) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985) to name but a few.  Jennifer Salke (Head of Amazon MGM Studios) had this to say about the resurrection:   “With his proven track record of delivering global hits and an eye towards theatrical fare, Scott’s expertise and vision align perfectly with our film strategy.

I’ve had quite a couple months, and I wish I could say that I was gallivanting around the globe, but not this time. I’ve been sick a good chunk of it. In fact, I had quite a fever when I screened Murder Company, written by Jesse Mittelstadt and directed by Shane Dax Taylor. I don’t know that it would be fair to the filmmakers to review the film, given that I was feeling so awful while watching it that I don’t think my thoughts would necessarily be a true reflection of how the movie was. I will make a few observations, though.  First of all, Kelsey Grammer was my favorite thing about Murder Company, which is currently On Digital and On Demand, and I wanted him to have far more screen time. I love a serious Kelsey Grammer, and he's incredibly serious in this. Second, while there was far less graphic violence and gore than I would have expected from a war movie made in this day and age, the filmmakers seemed to compensate for that with the amount of people flying around, proving yet again that stunt men are insane. “Yeah, you can hurl me into that tree. Sure.” Finally, could we please stop having people engage in casual conversations while walking through enemy-occupied territories?

I think I've got quite a high threshold of what weird would be. Yeah, I have. Also, I'm a serial monogamist, and I've been married twice. I was married for seven years, and the very first night I went out after the divorce – which was quite a long time after the divorce – I met my second husband, so I haven't really done much dating. I should have done a lot more. No, I honestly, I'm absolutely stumped. So unlike me.

The psychological thriller The Image of You examines duality in the form of twins, Zoe and Anna, who although they look identical, couldn’t be further apart. When sweet and naïve Anna meets a man and falls in love quickly, her bad-girl twin Zoe aims to test the strength of the relationship and the caliber of man who has captured her sister’s heart. The movie will be in select theaters and on Digital Friday, May 10.  I had an opportunity to speak with director Jeff Fisher about directing dual roles. Check it out!   I want to start with kind of a crazy icebreaker question, but what is the weirdest or craziest experience you've had dating, that you're willing to share? “Oh, my God. The weirdest or craziest experience I've had dating. This is not going to paint me in a very good light. I will tell you, my last long-term relationship, we met at a bar. I don't know if this was dating. We made out in the back of the bar for three and a half hours, on our first meeting, so it was an egregious public display of affection, and just shameless. I guess that would be my weirdest, but it was great. It didn't show a lot of couth, but there we go. I'll go with that.” Couth is overrated. How did you get involved in The Image of You?  “The production company helped with distribution on my first feature back in 2008.

In this post-apocalyptic era, the earth’s oxygen level has reached a not-fit-for-life amount, yet one family has survived thanks to the engineering genius and survivalistic skills of Darius (Common). He, his wife, Maya (Jennifer Hudson), and their daughter, Zora (Quvenzhané Wallis) live in a DIY-tech dwelling amidst the ruins. When Darius ventures out and remains gone longer than expected, Zora, who has learned much from her dad, attempts to reach out, bringing unwanted consequences.   I caught up with director Stefon Bristol to chat a bit about his personal journey, Breathe, and working with its cast. Check it out! I feel a little sleep-deprived today. Do you find that as a director, you're more sleep-deprived than the average person? “Definitely. When you're working on set, or you're doing pre-production, or you're in post, definitely. But this is what I love to do for my life, and I wouldn't have it any other way.\" How did you get into directing? I know you worked with Spike Lee, but what interested you about it?  “Directing? I grew up in Brooklyn. I grew up in Coney Island. When I was a kid, I was watching DVDs with director's commentary and special features, behind the scenes.

    "description": "Barbarella Chats with Raymond St-Jean about DUSK FOR A HITMAN Read the full article on AICN Hi, my friends. Barbarella here. Did you know that there’s a new drama about a hitman coming to Digital and On Demand tomorrow, April 19? French language film DUSK FOR A HITMAN may be based on a true story, but it includes its share of fiction. Written by Martin Gerard and Raymond St-Jean, who also directed, the film transports viewers back to the late 70’s, early 80’s as the most feared hitman in Montreal finds himself a target.  Make no mistake. This is not a John Wick action-packed assault on your senses. No, DUSK FOR A HITMAN plants itself firmly in the realm of drama.   While I like the film, portions of the story feel quite familiar to me because I recently finished the Max series TOKYO VICE, which includes a similar narrative around a gangster and his brother who wants to be in the life. I feel it’s unfair to compare the two, because they handle the subject differently, and the series has the time to really flesh out the characters and situations over several episodes. The added time granted allows a deeper connection to the characters than DUSK FOR A HITMAN’s runtime provides. That said, Érik Bruneau’s performance as a conflicted man truly enhances the movie’s impact. The film also beautifully captures the vibe of the era and removes the glamour from the gangster lifestyle.  I had the opportunity to speak with director and co-writer Raymond St-Jean. Check it out, mes amis!    This movie is based on an actual person, and Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "SLEEPING DOGS co-writer/director Adam Cooper in Conversation with McEric about thriller starring Russell Crowe and Karen Gillan Read the full article on AICN Opening today in theaters only is the new mind-bending thriller from writer/director Adam Cooper SLEEPING DOGS, starring Russell Crowe, Karen Gillan, Tommy Flanagan, and Márton Csókás. The synopsis reads “An ex-homicide detective (Russell Crowe) with memory loss is forced to solve a brutal murder he can't recall. But as evidence uncovers secrets tied to his forgotten past, he is led to a chilling truth - sometimes, it's best to let sleeping dogs lie.”   Check out the trailer:   Now if the synopsis and the trailer make the film seem predictable to you, you’d totally be forgiven. Maybe you’re like me and you’ve seen enough movies to know that the “chilling truths” are almost always exactly what you think they are. What SLEEPING DOGS offers, however, is a clever deconstruction of a brilliant mind, double-turned-triple-crosses, a femme fatale to truly die for, and stellar performances from everyone in attendance. There are practically zero sour notes in the film, and it is fun to watch with a friend and pause as you give your predictions, à la a spirited game of CLUE, to see who comes closest to the final conclusion.   Russell Crowe is wonderful in the role of Roy Freeman, a former detective who is living a labeled life as he struggles with dementia brought about by a damning automobile accident. When a man he put away is facing execution, Roy takes it upon himself to re-investigate a decade-old murder despite often failing to recall his own name.

    "description": "\"You can fly?? You can fly!!\" Time for yet another Classic Trailer Rewatch session. Back to the 90s again to revisit one of the best animated movies ever made. Back in 1999, Brad Bird directed a movie called The Iron Giant as his feature directorial debut. It didn't do so well at the box office, but that's okay, because it has gone on to become one of the most beloved, remembered, and celebrated animated movies of all-time. And if you haven't seen it, any day is a good day to watch this one – this post will be your reminder. From director Brad Bird – a young boy befriends a giant robot from outer space that a paranoid government agent wants to destroy. The movie features the voices of Eli Marienthal as Hogarth Hughes, Vin Diesel (yes for real!!) as The Iron Giant, Harry Connick Jr., Jennifer Aniston, James Gammon, Cloris Leachman, and M. Emmet Walsh. Almost everyone loves this movie. Even Roger Ebert gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars when he reviewed it when it first opened in ...",

It's titled Me and it's launching on Vimeo to watch later this week - after playing at film festivals including Overlook Film Festival, Chicago Critics Film Festival, and a few others. Me is a 22-minute musical odyssey about trauma, technology, and the retreat of humanity into itself. Described as a \"mysterious new musical.\" Not much more is known beyond that, but reviews do add a bit of detail. One explains: \"We are in a representation of a world we are familiar with, there is a narrative but it is more of a parable, and what we are shown is personal and political. Things are bleak and depressing, but occasionally beauty and hope break through our cacophony of suffering.... It was funny and sad, and it made me want to cling onto what I love.\" Yep, sounds like a Don Hertzfeldt film for sure!

This first premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, where it won a Special Jury Prize; it then went on to play at the Telluride, Toronto, and New York Film Festivals this fall. Shot entirely in secret, Rasoulof's award-winning thriller, The Seed of the Sacred Fig, centers on a family thrust into the public eye when Iman is appointed as an investigating judge in the capital city of Tehran, Iran. As political unrest erupts in the streets, Iman realizes that his job is even more dangerous than expected, making him increasingly paranoid and distrustful, even of his own wife Najmeh and daughters Sana and Rezvan. A tragic tale of how paranoia corrupts good people. Starring Misagh Zare, Soheila Golestani, Mahsa Rostami, Setareh Maleki, Niousha Akhshi, Reza Akhlaghi, Shiva Ordooei, and Amineh Arani.

While most of the trailers have focused on the relationship between Elphaba and Glinda, since both of them are needed to sell this movie, this spot is actually different. It begins with the connection we all know from The Wizard of Oz - \"before she was called 'wicked'\" - as in the Wicked Witch of the West. 🧙‍♀️ After two decades as one of the most beloved and enduring musicals on the stage, Wicked makes its long-awaited journey to the big screen as a spectacular, generation-defining cinematic event this holiday season. Made by filmmaker Jon M. Chu (Crazy Rich Asians, In the Heights), Wicked is the first chapter of a two-part immersive, cultural celebration. Acclaimed actress Cynthia Erivo stars as Elphaba Thropp, a young woman with green skin who eventually becomes the iconic Wizard of Oz villain that everyone knows (and fears). Ariana Grande co-stars as Glinda, with Michelle Yeoh, Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Marissa Bode, Bowen Yang, ...",

Two of the latest videos created by the iconic cinema video essayist Patrick Willems (who has a popular YouTube channel) are about trains and trains in movies. Inspired while on a visit to the Swiss Alps, Willems thought about the recent Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One and decided to make this essay. It's called \"Why Are Movies So Obsessed With Trains?\" and it runs a full 48 minutes, exploring in great detail the history of trains, their connection to cinema, and so much more. He also created a second follow-up video called \"The Infinite Possibilities of Train Action Scenes\" (which is also 45 minutes long). View both videos below - which is basically like watching an entire feature-length film that's also about watching films. My answer to his questions: trains are awesome.

In Former Pizza Huts. Yes, that is the full title, with both sentences! This is premiering at the 2024 SXSW Sydney Film Festival as well as the Chicago International Film Festival this fall in the US. What is it about? It recalls the origins of Pizza Hut, created in 1958 by two brothers from Wichita, KS. But since the era of Pizza Hut is pretty much over (or is it?), the film is also an examination of what these old Pizza Hut buildings have become. \"From an LGBTQ+ church in Florida, to a karaoke bar in Texas, to a cannabis dispensary in rural Colorado...\" This new feature doc is the work of Matthew Salleh \u0026 Rose Tucker, an award-winning Australian-born, Brooklyn-based filmmaking duo whose previous films include Barbecue and We Don't Deserve Dogs.

    "description": "Now that you've seen it, what did you think? \"I When I first saw Joker. When I saw you. For once in my life, I didn't feel so alone anymore.\" Now in theaters worldwide is Joker: Folie à Deux, aka Joker 2, the highly anticipated sequel to the controversial \u0026 divisive Joker from 2019 (also made by Todd Phillips). The beloved DC Comics villain is back on the big screen! The story is a direct continuation following the events of the first movie. Arthur Fleck (starring Joaquin Phoenix) is institutionalized at Arkham, awaiting trial for his crimes as Joker. It's there he meets Lee Quinzel - played by Lady Gaga. While struggling with his dual identity, Arthur not only stumbles upon true love, but also finds the music that's always been inside him. Is is it as good as the first movie? Is it as bad as the first movie? Does it have more to say this time? Or is it worse? Will this sequel provoke a strong reaction just like the first movie? The reviews are in - and ...",

    "description": "\"Today's the perfect day for bloodbath.\" Brainstorm Media has revealed the official US trailer for an action epic about a real moment in history titled Stockholm Bloodbath, yet another new film made by Swedish director Mikael Håfström. He also directed this year's Slingshot, but this film was finished before that one and premiered in Sweden last year - only now getting a US release. Anne and Freja seek revenge on the men who murdered their family. They end up in Stockholm, where they are drawn into a political power struggle between Sweden and Denmark which culminates in a mass execution. Featuring a big cast of international actors, including Sophie Cookson, Claes Bang, and Alba August, Stockholm Bloodbath is an action, adventure, and comedy that follows two sisters who seek revenge on the powerful men who brutally slayed their family. The cast also features Mikkel Boe Følsgaard, Jakob Oftebro, Ulrich Thomsen, Emily Beecham, Thomas Chaanhing, Kate Ashfield, Adam Pålsson, and Wilf Scolding. Damn! This looks big and epic and gnarly. So many split screen shots in this! Even the title cards ...",

Now underway in Spain is the 57th Sitges Film Festival, still regarded as THE best horror film festival in all of Europe. It's also the oldest horror festival in the world, with the very first festival taking place in 1968. This is my 6th year back to Sitges, and I'm glad to be in town. Sitges is a small beach town located just 30 minutes by train from Barcelona in Catalonia. The official Catalan name of this fest is Festival Internacional de Cinema Fantàstic de Catalunya, which just translates to Sitges International Fantastic Film Festival of Catalonia. Now that I'm based in Europe, it's much easier for me to attend Sitges instead of TIFF or Fantastic Fest or Fantasia or Beyond Fest or Telluride Horror Show (some of the best genre fests in North America). I'm glad Sitges usually plays the best films from these fests for everyone here in Europe to feast upon. And so now we begin, diving into horror and sci-fi and ...",

This premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival as one of the final films at the end of the fest. In war-torn times, a poor woodcutter and his wife live in a great forest in Poland. One day, the woman finds and rescues a baby girl, bringing irrevocable change to the lives of the couple, and to those whose paths the child will cross. The story follows a Holocaust-surviving Jewish girl whose father throws her from a moving train heading to Auschwitz who is luckily found and raised by these two people. The voices include Jean-Louis Trintignant as the narrator, Grégory Gadebois as the woodcutter, with Denis Podalydès and Dominique Blanc.

This would play well as a double feature with Alex Winter's excellent doc Trust Machine: The Story of Blockchain a few years back. \"In the future of money, who holds the power?\" Indeed. In Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery, intrepid filmmaker Cullen Hoback dives into the origins of Bitcoin and the identity of its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. The captivating new doc film offers a thrilling, globe-spanning investigation, with Hoback immersing himself with key players, uncovering never-before-seen clues, and humorously unraveling Bitcoin's meteoric rise. It's executive produced by Adam McKay (director of The Big Short), Todd Schulman, Cullen Hoback, and Taylor Jones. And it'll be streaming on Max later this month. I'm always fascinated by these kind of investigations, but they're never critical enough or hard-hitting when it comes to the danger of a world obsessed with crypto.

It's directed by George Nolfi (of The Adjustment Bureau, The Banker) and has a November release date - opening nationwide in theaters everywhere (teaser trailer here). Set in the post-apocalyptic Rocky Mountains, a single father and two women venture from the safety of their homes to face monstrous creatures to save the life of a young boy. This action sci-fi monster movie stars Anthony Mackie, Morena Baccarin, and Maddie Hasson. This trailer reveals that the title is related to these alien(?) monsters not being able to go above the elevation of 8,000ft (or 2,438m) hence why hanging out up in the Colorado mountains is a good idea.

In a not-too-distant future, Denmark faces total evacuation due to rising water levels (climate change is definitely going to ruin everything whether we like it or not). As the nation of ~6 million people prepares to leave their homes, high school student Laura must choose between her divorced parents and the boy she's fallen in love with. It's a clever flip on the refugee crisis the world is experiencing already - what if wealthy, white people in Denmark had to flee their homes and move to other countries. What would happen?

Hulu is also debuting Mr. Crocket this month as part of their offerings. In Carved, a group of survivors finds themselves trapped inside a historical reenactment village on Halloween, where they must unite to battle a sentient, vengeful pumpkin. Scary! The film stars Peyton Elizabeth Lee, Corey Fogelmanis, Wyatt Lindner, Carla Jimenez, DJ Qualls, Marc-Sully Saint-Fleur, Sasha Mason, Jonah Lees, Matty Cardarople, Elvis Nolasco, and Jackson Kelly. The practical FX of the pumpkin look pretty gnarly, but the rest of this looks awful. All of the characters are so cheesy and idiotic, none of this looks that fun unfortunately.
