    "description": "In this episode of the Duct Tape Marketing Podcast, I had the pleasure of interviewing Brandy Burch, CEO and co-founder of BenefitBay, a company innovating the employee health benefits industry through Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangements (ICHRAs). With a vision to make health benefits more accessible and customizable, Brandy has rapidly expanded BenefitBay and helped redefine how employers approach employee health coverage by ensuring fair and equal purchasing power. We discuss the evolution of employee health benefits, the advantages of ICHRAs for employers and employees, and the complexities involved in implementing these arrangements. From Tech-first inexperienced health benefit startups to the burden of having too many choices, Brandy Burch explains that DIYing health benefits internally is not all it's cracked up to be and giving employees a say in what benefits they choose from pets to fertility can be an enormous BENEFIT to seeking talent, as an agency. Brandy Burch also shares insights on risk management, the role of BenefitBay in the market, and the importance of personalization in employee benefits. The conversation also touches on the challenges female CEOs face in the insurance industry and the unique advantages of Kansas City as a tech hub for health benefits innovation.

    "description": "Bill Shufelt founded Athletic Brewing Company to re-invent non-alcoholic beer, but quickly learned that brewers didn’t want to make it, stores didn’t want to sell it, and potential customers didn’t want to buy it. The NA beer that already existed was outdated and foul-tasting, but Bill was convinced that if he could make a good-tasting brew, it would appeal to a growing cohort of people who wanted to enjoy beer without getting buzzed. For a while, Bill’s wife was the only person who supported him, but he eventually found an innovative brewer, and a winning strategy of sampling the beer at athletic events. Today, the company is valued at $800 million and Bill believes they’re just getting started.This episode was produced by J.C.
