As a longtime Silicon Valley engineer and executive andÂ cofounder of the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing conference,Â Telle Whitney argues that tech culture is still too closed-off and unwelcoming to different points of view, which leads to products and services thatÂ arenâ€™tÂ as good as they could beÂ â€”Â for consumers and society. She thinks theÂ industryÂ â€”Â and corporate tech departmentsÂ â€”Â can stayÂ innovative while also becoming more inclusiveÂ andÂ shares herÂ advice for leaders who want to help.Â Whitney is the author of the new bookÂ Rebooting Tech Culture: How to Ignite Innovation and Build Organizations Where Everyone Can Thrive.",

    "description": "Often called the Oscars of the food industry, the James Beard Foundation Awards are among the most coveted for chefs in America. But what's sold and packaged as prestige can sometimes become a distraction from managing the business that got you there. Host Matt Brown is joined by The New York Times food critic Brett Anderson \u0026 chef Chintan Pandya (Dhamaka, Semma, Adda, Unapologetic Foods) to learn that an award can not only change a winner's life but an entire industry as a whole.",

    "description": "In 2008, Vicky Tsai walked away from a startup job and set out to rediscover herself on a trip to Japan. In Kyoto, she had an unforgettable meeting with a geisha, and learned about the face creams and blotting papers that the traditional Japanese hostesses had used for centuries. But as she contemplated selling those products in the U.S., experts on both sides of the Pacific told her it would never work. Strapped for money and juggling multiple jobs, Vicky worked out of her parents' garage, pitching her new brandâ€”Tatchaâ€”on QVC and steadily growing it. In 2019, Unilever acquired Tatcha for a reported $500 million.This episode was produced by Jed Anderson with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei.
