Marc also discusses his latest venture - Wonder - and its recent shift away from food prep and delivery vans; plus, what founders should consider when making their own strategic pivots. First we meet Ben in Oregon, who’s wondering if his chocolate factory should double down on an experiential offering in light of increased cocoa prices. Then Lindsey in Utah, who’s looking for ways to convince retailers to carry her portable diaper kits. And Ryan in Colorado, who’s weighing whether to focus on national expansion for his whiskey brand, or deepening market penetration in the Rockies. Thank you to the founders of Chomp Chocolate, Baby a GoGo and 10th Mountain Whiskey and Spirit Company for being part of the show.If you’d like to be featured on a future Advice Line episode, leave us a one minute message that tells us about your business and a specific question you’d like answered. Send a voice memo to hibt@id.wondery.com or call 1-800-433-1298.And be sure to listen to Marc Lore’s founding story as told by Marc on the show in 2021.  This episode was produced by Kerry Thompson.

    "description": "When Kip Tindell co-founded The Container Store in 1978, people laughed at him for wanting to sell empty boxes. But Kip and his partners had identified a clear problem—the tyranny of household clutter—and a new category of solutions: metal crates, stackable wicker baskets, sleek lucite canisters. The Container Store’s promise of affordable organization made it an instant hit, and Kip’s wife Sharon soon joined the partnership. Decades later, as online shopping took off, the business faltered; and in 2013, when The Container Store went public, Kip and Sharon came to regret it.This episode was produced by J.C.

    "description": "Zillow laid him off. So John Doherty launched Credo a digital agency matchmaking firm. Exactly 7 years later — to the day — he sold the company. This is the story of how he built and sold Credo, and how he’s building his latest company, EditorNinja, which offers outsourced text editing. John Doherty is the founder of Credo, which matches digital agencies with clients. After an exit in 2022, he built his professional editing/SEO service EditorNinja. When he’s not doing that, he disconnects from everything tech and goes skiing. Sponsored byGusto – The HR platform so well designed that your team will thank you for using them.

    "description": "Asking questions is a powerful way to build trust, exchange ideas, and unlock value in organizations. And it is a skill that can be honed to make work conversations more productive, say Leslie K. John and Alison Wood Brooks, professors at Harvard Business School. In this classic episode, they join former host Sarah Green Carmichael to talk through insights from behavioral science research. They share techniques to adjust the frame, tone, and type of questions to improve results—whether you’re looking to get information, find solutions, or just get someone to like you. Brooks and John wrote the article “The Surprising Power of Questions” in the May–June 2018 issue of Harvard Business Review.",

    "description": "Many companies make money by selling goods that need to be constantly replaced; think fast fashion, or tech devices that come out in new versions each year. But according to Vijay Govindarajan, professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, smart organizations are increasingly eschewing that strategy for one focused on products that grow with the consumer through creative design or software updates. He shares several examples and explains how this approach can deliver more value for the buyer – and for the business – over the long term. Govindarajan is the coauthor of the HBR article \"Design Products That Won't Become Obsolete.\"",
