    "description": "Often called the Oscars of the food industry, the James Beard Foundation Awards are among the most coveted for chefs in America. But what's sold and packaged as prestige can sometimes become a distraction from managing the business that got you there. Host Matt Brown is joined by The New York Times food critic Brett Anderson \u0026 chef Chintan Pandya (Dhamaka, Semma, Adda, Unapologetic Foods) to learn that an award can not only change a winner's life but an entire industry as a whole.",

    "link": "",
    "description": "Sam and Mariah Calagione started dating in high school, and have been on a wild ride ever since. Their biggest, craziest adventure? Founding Dogfish Head Brewery and forever changing the landscape of American craft beer. From the moment Sam started home-brewing in his NYC apartment, he infused his beer with unusual ingredients like cherries, maple syrup, roasted chicory, and licorice. When he and Mariah officially launched Dogfish Head in 1995, it was the smallest brewery in America’s smallest state. 24 years (and countless pints) later, it was acquired by the Boston Beer Company for $300 million. Along the way, Sam and Mariah had one random experience after another: writing a bill to legalize their own brew-pub, winning best recipe at the Delaware Punkin Chunkin, and inviting Ricki Lake to their first tasting at Sam's apartment (spoiler alert: she showed up).This episode was produced by Alex Cheng with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei.
