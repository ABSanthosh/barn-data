As a longtime Silicon Valley engineer and executive and cofounder of the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing conference, Telle Whitney argues that tech culture is still too closed-off and unwelcoming to different points of view, which leads to products and services that aren’t as good as they could be — for consumers and society. She thinks the industry — and corporate tech departments — can stay innovative while also becoming more inclusive and shares her advice for leaders who want to help. Whitney is the author of the new book Rebooting Tech Culture: How to Ignite Innovation and Build Organizations Where Everyone Can Thrive.",

    "description": "As a young entrepreneur in the Wild West days of the internet, Alex Tew was drawn to meditation for its simple calming power. Together with fellow tech founder Michael Acton Smith–known for hits like Moshi Monsters–the two brainstormed ways to bring the ancient practice of meditation into the 21st century. In 2011, they bought the domain calm.com, built an app, and started producing meditations and Sleep Stories, narrated by celebrities like Matthew McConaughey and Idris Elba. Despite initial pushback from investors who insisted no one would want to meditate on their phone–let alone pay for it– the Calm app grew to a valuation of nearly $2 billion, with 180 million total downloads. This episode was researched and produced by Katherine Sypher with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei.
