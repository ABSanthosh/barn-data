    "description": "AlthoughÂ weâ€™veÂ seen great successes come out of the technology sector in recent decades, many criticsÂ â€”Â and even some insidersÂ â€”Â say itâ€™s due for an overhaul. As a longtime Silicon Valley engineer and executive andÂ cofounder of the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing conference,Â Telle Whitney argues that tech culture is still too closed-off and unwelcoming to different points of view, which leads to products and services thatÂ arenâ€™tÂ as good as they could beÂ â€”Â for consumers and society. She thinks theÂ industryÂ â€”Â and corporate tech departmentsÂ â€”Â can stayÂ innovative while also becoming more inclusiveÂ andÂ shares herÂ advice for leaders who want to help.Â Whitney is the author of the new bookÂ Rebooting Tech Culture: How to Ignite Innovation and Build Organizations Where Everyone Can Thrive.",
