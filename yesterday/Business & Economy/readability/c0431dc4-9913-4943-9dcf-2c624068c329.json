  "text": "(Bloomberg) -- In the quiet days before Christmas last year, when most venture capitalists had retreated to holiday escapes in Aspen or Jackson Hole, Lightspeed Venture Partners’ investing team was contemplating a bid for a piece of OpenAI rival Anthropic. Most Read from Bloomberg What Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Vienna Embraces Heat Pumps to Ditch Russian Gas Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30 The venture capital firm approached Anthropic with an offer to lead a multibillion-dollar investment, according to a person familiar with the matter. An agreement quickly took shape: a $2 billion funding round at a $60 billion valuation, tripling what the startup was worth a year earlier. By early January, the deal was effectively done. With $25 billion under management, Lightspeed is part of a rarified strata of VC firms willing and able to back tech’s hottest, and most expensive, companies. In addition to Anthropic, Lightspeed has recently participated in a large funding round for artificial intelligence company Databricks Inc. that valued it at $62 billion, as well as an investment in Elon Musk’s xAI at a $50 billion valuation. AI megadeals have become a staple of the top-tier VC diet despite the risks, including that firms haven’t yet proven they can profit off these investments. “It’s high-stakes poker,” said Sierra Ventures Managing Partner Tim Guleri, an AI investor. In the past three months alone, xAI, OpenAI and Anthropic have raised more than $20 billion to support their hefty computing costs. Those deals collectively valued the three companies at more than $250 billion. Altogether, US AI startups raised a record $97 billion in 2024, according to PitchBook data. For venture capitalists, there is rising pressure — particularly on those that missed the chance to back the top AI companies at lower prices — to align themselves with the leading players before it’s too late, investors said. Representatives for Lightspeed and Anthropic declined to comment for this story. “It shows you’re in the game,” said Peter Werner, co-chair of Cooley’s venture capital practice group. “What you don’t want to be is a venture fund that is trying to be in the mix, missing out or developing a reputation that you’re not nimble enough to get into the best and hottest rounds.” VC Shift Lightspeed was founded more than 20 years ago on the heels of the dot-com bust by Barry Eggers, Christopher Schaepe, Peter Nieh and Ravi Mhatre, who led the Anthropic negotiations. It’s best known for savvy investments in consumer technology, fintech and enterprise software, making early bets on companies like Snap Inc., Affirm Holdings Inc. and Rubrik Inc. Despite its track record, the firm has yet to become as much of a household name as some of the most famous tier one VC players. With its aggressive AI bets, insiders say these deals could permanently elevate its standing — if they succeed.",
