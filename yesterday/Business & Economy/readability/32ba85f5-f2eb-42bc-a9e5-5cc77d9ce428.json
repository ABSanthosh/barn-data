The final tally of the surprise vote Tuesday was 196 in favor and 223 against.Thirteen Republicans voted with Democrats to block the legislation from moving forward.It was unclear late Tuesday what the next steps for the package would be, after House Republican leadership abruptly decided against holding another vote the same day.The measures had been widely expected to pass. The failure of the rule during what is being billed as \"Crypto Week\" was a rare instance of House Republicans refusing to take direction from Trump.Republican leaders have not clarified yet whether a second vote would be for an identical rule and the same bills, or whether members would make changes to the package to satisfy GOP conference members who opposed the current motion.Crypto-linked stocks turned lower after the vote failed.Storm clouds hover over the U.S. Capitol on July 1, 2025 in Washington, DC.Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesRead more CNBC politics coverageCuomo launches independent New York City mayoral bid after losing Democratic primary to MamdaniElon Musk looms over jury selection in Tesla Autopilot fatality trialIt's a huge week for crypto in D.C.
