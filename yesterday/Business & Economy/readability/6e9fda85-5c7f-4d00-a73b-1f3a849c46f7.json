The Manufacturing index ended marginally lower. Meanwhile, the BSE Consumer Durables, Consumer Discretionary and Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) indices surged around 2.5% each.By cutting income taxes, the government wants to put more money into the hands of individuals and encourage them to spend, a move aimed at reviving flagging consumption.Motilal Oswal Financial Services said the budget, for the first time in many years, chose to stimulate consumption and savings instead of focusing on capex.Bhamre is most bullish on paints, consumer durables such as electric goods manufacturers, and two-wheeler maker Bajaj Auto because most of these stocks have been underperformers and will benefit from an increase in consumption.\"Consumption stocks are expected to lead the market rally in the near to medium term,\" said Divam Sharma, Founder and Fund manager, Green Portfolio PMS. \"The increased spending by the middle class could also alleviate the lower growth numbers in auto and FMCG companies.\"Though the tide on Dalal Street is against manufacturing and industrials in the near future, market participants warned against writing the theme off.Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
