While Adani has denied all these allegations, the group has lost over 20%, or ₹2.89 lakh crore, in market value since the announcement on Thursday.Shares of all the 11 listed companies ended lower on Tuesday, falling between 1% and 7% after Fitch Ratings put some Adani Group bonds under its negative watchlist.Adani Green Energy plunged 7.3% and Adani Enterprises - the flagship company - slumped 4.1%. Adani Energy Solutions, Adani Total Gas and Adani Ports and SEZ dropped over 3% each on Tuesday.\"The Fitch move to out Adani Energy Solutions and some Adani Ports bonds under its 'negative watch' list could make it tough for the Adani Group of companies to raise fresh credit because the negative sentiment is expected to spill on the other group companies as well,\" said Manish Chowdhury, head of research at StoxBox.AgenciesFrench Oil major TotalEnergies said it won't make any fresh investments in Adani Group companies till it gets clarity on the accusations against officials in the company, while Kenya cancelled more than $2.5 billion in airport deals with Adani.\"Adani Group is not expected to default on the existing debt, but growth is likely to take a hit as fundraising could be a challenge in the foreseeable future because most of the sectors that Adani Group operates in have government focus,\" said Mumbai-based independent market expert Ambareesh BaligaAdani Group shares have fallen between 3% and 37% since the indictment with Adani Green Energy - the group company named in the indictment - falling the most. Adani Enterprises dropped nearly 24% in this period.\"Traders can use the fall as a buying opportunity, but investors are advised to remain cautious and stay away as valuations are not attractive and given the continued controversies,\" said Baliga.Concerns over the likelihood of continued adverse news flow on the Adani Group means these stocks remain vulnerable to further downsides.\"These stocks are likely to react to news flows going forward and if there is any further negative news, the stocks could slide further,\" said Chowdhury. \"In the near-term, Adani stocks are expected to remain under pressure.\"Chowdhury said that investors can 'wait and watch' till further clarity emerges and remain cautious until then.Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2024 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
