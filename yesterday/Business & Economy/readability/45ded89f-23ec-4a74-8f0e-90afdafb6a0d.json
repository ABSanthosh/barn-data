Other key investors in the round include Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath, film actor Suniel Shetty, industrialist Vinod Duggar and key investor Manish Patel. Proxgy, founded by Pulkit Ahuja in 2020, leverages technologies such as artificial intelligence and IoT, where devices communicate with each intelligently. Its innovations include  SmartHat, a safety helmet featuring the smallest gas detection sensor, health monitoring systems, cameras, and connectivity protocols like 4G and WiFi. Another such innovation is ‘Sleefe’ a wearable smart device that converts any cap into a smart cap, offering real time monitoring and communication for industrial workers.  “Proxgy’s products have the potential to redefine safety and productivity in industrial environments,” said Ajinkya Rahane. Pulkit Ahuja, founder and CEO of Proxgy, said Ajinkya Rahane’s support, along with others, is a huge endorsement of the company’s vision. “This funding will enable us to expand globally,” said Ahuja.
