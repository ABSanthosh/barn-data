  "text": "Mumbai: India's equity indices on Tuesday posted their worst start to a new financial year in five years, ahead of US President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariff regime that's set to be unleashed on Wednesday. The sell-off underscored investors' uncertainty over the economic impact of the tariffs, while the absence of follow-up foreign buying after the gush of flows last week poured cold water on expectations that the worst may be over for the market.The NSE Nifty fell 353.65 points, or 1.5%, to close at 23,165.70 in its worst single-day performance in a month. The BSE Sensex declined 1,390.41 points, or 1.8%, to end at 76,024.51.\"Fundamentally, we do not see any shift in Indian equity markets, and we believe they have not bottomed out yet,\" said Amit Jain, cofounder of Ashika Global Family Office Services. \"While Tuesday's sell-off was more due to Trump's tariff fears, the recovery that we saw over the last few weeks was majorly due to short covering by FIIs (foreign institutional investors).\" Large Caps Under Pressure On Tuesday, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold stocks worth a net ₹5,902 crore. In March, they made net purchases worth ₹1,629 crore, thanks to some aggressive buying in the latter part of the month.Overseas investors had been selling for the five months before that. Domestic institutions were buyers to the tune of ₹4,323 crore on Tuesday.Trump said the US will be imposing a uniform global tariff or import duty on all countries, with no exceptions.Ashika's Jain said large caps, especially in IT, pharmaceuticals and automobile sectors, may remain under pressure in the coming days due to the possible tariff imposition.Nifty's realty, IT, consumer durables and financial services indices were the top losers of the day, down 2-3%. Pharma shares also declined over concerns.\"Indian pharma companies provide a high price advantage, which is likely to remain competitive despite tariffs and no duty is expected on IT services currently,\" said George Thomas, fund manager, equity, at Quantum AMC. \"While there may be some company-specific impact, we do not see major downside risk from this stage for the market,\" he added.Global markets rebounded on Tuesday, after a steep decline on Monday due to Trump's tariff fears. Indian markets were shut on Monday on account of Eid.In Asia, China advanced 0.4%, Hong Kong increased 0.4%, South Korea gained 1.6%, Taiwan rose 2.8% and Japan remained flat on Tuesday.The pan-Europe index Stoxx 600 was up 1% at press time.At home, the broader market was a lot more resilient than the blue chips.Of the total 4,195 stocks traded on the BSE, 2,716 advanced and 1,343 declined at close, suggesting investor appetite for smaller shares. However, the Nifty Midcap 150 dropped 1%, and the Nifty Small-cap 250 fell 0.5%,\"Small caps are still lagging, but we have found good traction in midcaps in the recent run, which underscores a preference towards quality during this phase,\" said Anand James, chief market strategist at Geojit Investments.James said fewer small-cap constituents are trading below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) than midcaps, while more small caps gave away their March gains, in the last five days' decline.Jain said that historically, at the beginning of a new financial year, there is less pain in small and midcap stocks due to low foreign investment exposure. He added that they may outperform the benchmark Nifty over the next two to three months.Nifty's Volatility Index (VIX), popularly known as the 'fear indicator', jumped 8.4% to nearly 13.78 on Tuesday, indicating heightened caution among traders in the coming days.\"We believe it is a good time to start adding quality IT, FMCG and PSU bank stocks from a longer-term view, as they have bottomed out recently,\" said Jain. \"For traders, we suggest they do not hold any overnight positions due to the highly uncertain global environment at this point,\" he added.",
