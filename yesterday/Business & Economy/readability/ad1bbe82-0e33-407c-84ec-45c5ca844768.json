  "text": "By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. inflation increased by the most in eight months in December amid robust consumer spending on goods and services, suggesting the Federal Reserve would probably be in no hurry to resume cutting interest rates soon. While the report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed a modest gain in prices excluding the volatile food and energy components on a monthly basis, the annual increase in the so-called core inflation has not slowed since October. The disinflation progress stalled in the fourth quarter. The U.S. central bank kept rates unchanged on Wednesday for the first time since launching its policy easing cycle in September. The policy statement accompanying the decision did not include the reference to inflation having \"made progress\" toward the Fed's 2% target. The inflation outlook has been clouded by uncertainty about the economic impact of President Donald Trump's fiscal, trade and immigration policies. \"The Fed's prognosis is for a slower pace of monetary easing moving forward, as the economy is doing well and prices are only slowly returning to target in an environment of great uncertainty,\" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. \"These data support that strategy.\" The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index rose 0.3% last month, the largest increase since last April, after an unrevised 0.1% gain in November, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. The increase was in line with economists' expectations. Goods prices rose 0.2%, the first gain in five months, lifted by higher costs for motor vehicles and parts as well as gasoline and other energy goods, which jumped 4.2%. Prices of furnishings and durable household equipment plunged as they did for recreational goods and vehicles. The cost of services increased 0.3% amid gains in transportation, recreation, and housing and utilities. In the 12 months through December, PCE inflation advanced 2.6%. That was the biggest gain in seven months and followed a 2.4% rise in November. The data was included in the advance gross domestic product report for the fourth quarter published on Thursday. The Fed tracks the PCE price measures for monetary policy. It has reduced its benchmark overnight interest rate by 100 basis points to the 4.25%-4.50% range since September. The central bank has forecast only two rate cuts this year, down from the four it had projected in September amid caution over the new Trump administration's plans for tax cuts, broad tariffs on imports and an immigration crackdown, which economists view as inflationary.",
