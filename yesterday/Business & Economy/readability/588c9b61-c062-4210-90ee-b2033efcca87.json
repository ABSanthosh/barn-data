  "text": "Voters unhappy over soaring prices, including runaway housing costs, helped put Donald Trump back in the White House. But what will a second Trump presidency mean for the real-estate industry, and home buyers and sellers? It means higher mortgage rates in the immediate term, but further down the line, another Trump administration could also mean less regulation and more tax incentives across the board, experts told MarketWatch. ‘I’m devastated she didn’t win’: I voted for Kamala Harris. Am I disloyal for taking advantage of the Trump stock-market rally? Wall Street believes stocks will keep rising on Trump’s win — but this could threaten the rally U.S. stocks staged an epic rally after Trump won the election. What history says could happen before year-end. Druckenmiller: I’m worried the Fed declared victory on inflation too early ‘I feel we’ve failed’: My son wants me to take out a $150,000 student loan so he can attend an out-of-state college. Is that fair? “There’s likely to be two sides of the coin,” Mike Fratantoni, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, a trade group, told MarketWatch. Though Trump’s policies could lead to more tax perks and lighter regulation that could help home buyers and builders, Fratantoni explained, his policies could also trigger a bigger federal deficit, which could push up mortgage rates. Here are the six key points to watch out for in the coming months: Expect mortgage rates to remain elevated in the aftermath of the election. The 30-year mortgage rate averaged 7.13% as of Nov. 6, according to Mortgage News Daily. “Overnight, we’ve seen the 10-year Treasury rate up about 20 basis points,” Fratantoni said, “so you could reasonably expect that it is going to translate pretty closely to a similar increase in mortgage rates.” Mortgage rates tend to rise and fall in tandem with the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y, rather than following the Federal Reserve’s benchmark interest rate. The 10-year Treasury note has risen sharply over the past few weeks, in anticipation of a Trump victory, pulling up the 30-year mortgage rate along with it. Treasury yields typically go up when investors expect inflation to increase. With the Trump administration, expect a higher level of growth in the U.S. economy, higher inflation, and hence, a higher interest rate, Fratantoni said. The volatility is expected. When Trump was last elected in 2016, mortgage rates also went up, Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, told MarketWatch. Realtor.com is operated by News Corp subsidiary Move Inc., and MarketWatch is a unit of Dow Jones, which is also a subsidiary of News Corp.",
