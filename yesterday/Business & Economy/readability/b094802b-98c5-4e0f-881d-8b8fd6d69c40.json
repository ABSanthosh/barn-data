According to a Form 4 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Schatz sold a total of 2,166 shares over two days at prices ranging from $9.10 to $9.30 per share, amounting to a total transaction value of $20,123. The stock currently trades at $9.56, with analysts setting price targets between $17 and $21. InvestingPro data shows the company offers an attractive 8.26% dividend yield. Following these transactions, Schatz holds 29,200 shares of Class A common stock. Additionally, he possesses 218,833 shares of Class B common stock, including 21,846 shares not subject to vesting or transfer restrictions and 196,987 fully vested options to purchase Class B common stock. These sales and holdings reflect Schatz's current investment position in Townsquare Media, which has a market capitalization of $148.32 million and maintains a \"Fair\" financial health score according to InvestingPro, which offers 7 additional key insights about the company's performance and outlook. In other recent news, Townsquare Media has announced a new $50 million stock repurchase plan, replacing a similar plan set to expire in 2024. The company has also reported slight growth in net revenue to $115.3 million in its Q3 2024 earnings call, with digital revenue accounting for over half of the total. The digital advertising segment, which grew by 5%, and programmatic advertising, which increased by 10%, were key growth drivers. Despite a decline in national broadcast advertising, Townsquare Interactive is projected to show year-over-year revenue growth in Q4. The company also announced plans for debt refinancing in early 2025, anticipating favorable interest rate shifts. This development comes alongside a strong cash flow that led to $24 million in share buybacks and $36 million in bond buybacks. A partnership with SummitMedia for a white-label digital programmatic advertising solution is also expected to ramp up in 2025. These are the recent developments in Townsquare Media's financial strategy and operations. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.
