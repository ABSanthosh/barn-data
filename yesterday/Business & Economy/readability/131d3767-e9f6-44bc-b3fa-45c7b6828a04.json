These shares are part of the placements to investors and promoters done before the initial public offerings (IPOs).Bankers and brokers said a chunk of these shares could flood the market as various investors would look to book profits with the stock market precariously perched.\"Release of lock-in would necessarily mean an anticipation of oversupply in the market, which in turn has an effect on the stock prices,\" said Venkatraghavan S, MD of investment banking, Equirus. \"For savvy investors, we expect there will be a discipline and strategy to their divestment, driven by demand-supply considerations while some of the selling could be on account of portfolio rebalancing.\"AgenciesMarket observers will be keenly monitoring the actions of pre-IPO investors and promoters in firms such as Brainbees, Ola Electric Mobility, Premier Energies, Akums Drugs and Pharma, Concord Biotech, Juniper Hotels, Ceigall India and Swiggy, among others.The end of the lock-in may not mean an immediate sell-off, but shares of companies with weaker prospects are more vulnerable.\"Stocks with weak or negative performance may see anchor investors trimming their holdings,\" said Abhilash Pagaria, head of Nuvama Alternative \u0026 Quantitative Research. \"However, six-month-plus lock-ins, typically held by strategic investors and promoters, are less likely to result in open-market selling. Any exits in such cases will likely occur through block deals.\"Brainbees will see 33.53 crore shares worth ₹16,000 crore getting released from the lock-in period on February 10. Ola Electric Mobility will see 196 crore shares worth ₹13,000 crore unlocked on the same day. Similarly, shares worth ₹9,910 crore of Premier Energies will exit the lock-in on February 28, while Akums Drugs and Pharma will see ₹5,300-crore worth of shares unlocked on February 3.As per Sebi guidelines, anchor investors face a lock-in period of 90 days for 50% of their allotted shares from the date of allotment, and 30 days for the remaining 50%. For promoters, the lock-in requirement is 18 months for allotments up to 20% of the post-issue paid-up capital. For allotments exceeding 20%, the lock-in period is six months. Non-promoter investors also have a lock-in period of six months. According to Vaibhav Porwal, co-founder of Dezerv, oversupply from lock-in expiry must be seen in the context of the kind of free float being added to the daily trading volumes of each of the stocks. “Companies like Ola Electric and Brainbees were not widely owned prior to the IPO, and generally, institutional investors can stagger their supply over time,” he said. “Conversely, stocks like Swiggy were heavily distributed among HNIs and even retailers prior to the IPO and could potentially see a lot of supply come up to book profits.” Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
