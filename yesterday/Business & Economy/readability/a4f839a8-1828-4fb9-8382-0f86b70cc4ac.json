Ebitda for these companies may drop by 20-30%, while some profits could decline by 30-60%. Larger producers like UltraTech Cement and Ambuja Cements may fare better.Getty ImagesCement companies in India (Image for representation)Cement producers are likely to record net profit declines in the December quarter, spurring another round of earnings downgrades, offsetting the recent momentum in sales volume and prices.Cement makers' revenues are expected to remain flat from a year earlier in the December quarter despite a 7-8% increase in sales volumes, according to analyst estimates. While earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) for these companies are seen falling 20-30% year-on-year, profit is likely to decline by as much as 30-60% for some, the estimates showed.\"While soft power/fuel prices are positive, an earnings downgrade for FY25E-26E is likely on the cards considering the volatile pricing environment and lower-than-expected volume growth in 9mFY25,\" said Nuvama Institutional Equities.Cement producers faced a weak fiscal first half with volume growth falling to low single digits. While volumes generally tend to moderate during election years, companies got an additional hit from extreme weather conditions and intense price pressures. Cement prices remain 8-10% lower from the year earlier despite recent price hikes.While the October to March period is typically stronger for cement producers due to increased construction activity, recovery has been tepid so far this fiscal year.\"...the second half (of the fiscal) saw limited recovery due to low infrastructure activity,\" brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher said in a pre-earnings note. \"Pollution and cold waves in the northern region, wedding season across the country, and delays in government-funded projects also played a big spoilsport for demand, limiting potential recovery,\" it said.Late-2024, most cement companies cut volume growth expectations for FY25 to mid-single digits, from the double-digit growth that the industry had been seeing for the last three years.Larger producers, though, are seen faring better amid this slowdown, buoyed by the benefits of volume and cost efficiencies, analysts said. Most analysts remain positive on UltraTech Cement and Adani Group's Ambuja Cements.Estimates showed that net profit decline would be the least for these two large companies at around 30%, with several others seeing losses of up to 60%. Cement prices have been on a downtrend for more than a year now, as companies let go of pricing power in a bid to garner market share.\"With new cement capacities being continually added by both large and medium-sized companies, pricing is expected to remain dynamic and volatile,\" Axis Securities said, adding pricing wars in southern India are expected to be relatively intense.Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2024 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
