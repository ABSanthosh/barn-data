I have $400,000 in high-yield savings and I already have $1.5 million in the stock market. My home is paid off, and I have no debts. I have no interest in investing more money in the stock market, despite the recent “Trump bump.” I could buy another piece of property, but I’m not really interested in being a landlord again. That is too much money to leave in the bank. It has always been a comfort to have a good amount of money in the bank, but is it the smartest thing? No. ‘My father was a teetotaling, fair-minded, liberal-leaning capitalist’: And yet I allowed ‘friends’ to borrow $120K. How do I deal with the fallout? Yes, stocks are crazy expensive right now. These 5 charts show just how extreme valuations have become. The Fed interrupted the stock market’s Trump rally. What comes next? ‘I handle my dad’s finances’: My father is in a nursing home and will get $100K in compensation. What should I do with it? ‘I can’t deal with managing them’: I juggle 18 credit cards. How do I close them without ruining my credit score? Obviously some of it can be used as an emergency fund, but who needs that much of an emergency fund? Tell me your thoughts and suggestions on what direction to take. I’m retired, collecting Social Security and I do get an annuity payment every month. Saver and Investor Related: I’m 69 and have $10,000 in legal bills from my divorce. Is now the time to borrow from my IRA? Locking in the best interest rate is your main task, and enjoying the fruits of your labor. - MarketWatch illustration Your dilemma would be a luxury for many people. As you are retired and, by most Americans’ standards, flush with cash, I agree that there’s no reason for you to invest more money in the stock market at your age. Locking in the best interest rate is your main task, and enjoying the fruits of your labor. The 60/40 rule says you should keep 60% of your portfolio in stocks and 40% in bonds, but as you get older those percentages should change to reflect the amount of time you have to recover from a major correction in the markets. If you’re 65, you should have approximately 35% of your portfolio in stocks; if you’re 75, you should have 25% in stocks, and so on. So you could still take a small percentage of that money and invest it in shares. You could end up very, very lucky, like this guy. You have a choice between CDs and high-yield savings accounts (HYSA). CDs are investment vehicles with set interest rates for a period of time that attract people looking for a safe haven for their cash. High-yield savings accounts are more liquid, so you can take out your money more easily. Typically, withdrawals are limited to half a dozen per month.",
