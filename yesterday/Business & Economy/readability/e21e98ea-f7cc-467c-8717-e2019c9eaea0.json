Former NFL tight end Rob Gronkowski, who won multiple Super Bowls during his illustrious career, certainly qualifies as great. However, he was also incredibly lucky for his first stock trade, which netted him almost 1,000% profit on Apple shares he bought after a recommendation from his contractor. Don't Miss: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! CEO of Integris gathered a team of senior investment managers who have $34.22 billion in combined owned and managed assets in the West Coast — here’s how to invest in their private credit fund that targets 12% annual interest rate. Rob Gronkowski shot to fame as a prominent member of the New England Patriots dynasty led by Head Coach Bill Belichick and Quarterback Tom Brady. Unlike Belichick and Brady, known for their button-down, all-business personalities, Gronkowski was famous for his vibrant, fun-loving nature. So, it may come as a surprise to learn that Rob Gronkowski is financially astute, but by all accounts, he has handled his finances very well. In his 2018 book It's Good to Be Gronk, Rob revealed that he never spent any of the estimated $70 million he made playing in the NFL and avoided buying expensive items like cars and jewelry. Gronkowski parlayed his fun-loving personality into a successful career as a pitchman for some of America's most recognized brands, like T-Mobile and Dunkin Donuts. He lived off the money from his marketing deals, not his NFL salary. See Also: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever. Ironically, Gronkowski's first foray into stock trading happened entirely by accident. In an interview with Fortune Magazine, Gronk told how he made his first stock trade. \"My first stock ever was the Apple stock,\" Gronkowski said. \"The guy actually who built my house in Foxborough, he told me, ‘Hey, buy Apple stock.'\" At the time, Gronkowski wasn't familiar with stock trading, but he was intrigued. \"You know I'd never been involved in stocks and really didn't know how stocks worked,\" he continued. Eventually, Gronkowski decided to pull the trigger and purchased $69,000 worth of Apple shares. It was a rather large investment for a first-time stock buyer, but Gronkowski told Fortune, \"I'm going to go big, yeah obviously, this just fits along the lines of just me being myself.\"",
