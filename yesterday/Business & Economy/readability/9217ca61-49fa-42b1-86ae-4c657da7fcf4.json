Analysts anticipate continued margin pressure for consumer companies in the near term due to rising raw material costs and weak urban demand.AgenciesPunmiya said that FMCG sector valuations are still trading at a premium, although companies like Dabur, Hindustan Unilever, and Tata Consumer Products are relatively more attractive within the sector.Mumbai: Stocks of FMCG companies tumbled on Thursday, driven by concerns over sector leader HUL's declining revenue.The Nifty FMCG Index plunged nearly 3%, its steepest single-day drop in 28 months after HUL's second-quarter results missed expectations, disappointing investors. Analysts anticipate continued margin pressure for consumer companies in the near term due to rising raw material costs and weak urban demand.The Nifty FMCG shed 2.8%, while the benchmark Nifty dipped 0.15%. The sectoral index declined nearly 12% last month compared to the 6% fall in the Nifty 50.\"HUL's commentary highlighted the slowdown in the urban segment, mirroring what we saw with Nestle and Tata Consumer Products,\" said Preeyam Tolia, senior research analyst at Axis Securities. \"While rural demand remains stable, margin pressure is likely to persist due to volatility in palm oil and crude oil prices.\"Tolia also noted that ITC's diversified business might shield it from the full impact on margins, but investors will watch closely for further guidance on urban demand.AgenciesHUL stock fell 5.8%, while Colgate Palmolive and Marico dropped 3.4% and 3.2%, respectively. Godrej Consumer Products declined 3%, and Britannia Industries, Dabur, and Nestle were down by about 2%. Tata Consumer Products declined by 1.67% and ITC by 2%.Earlier this week, Nestle India chairman Suresh Narayanan warned that the FMCG sector is grappling with sluggish demand, driven by a combination of factors, including rising food inflation.Many analysts highlighted the challenges posed by inflationary pressures, which are affecting consumer spending and dampening growth in the sector. They had earlier expected urban markets to remain stable even as rural demand gradually recovered. However, the increased strain on urban demand has raised concerns.\"Given the limited pricing flexibility of FMCG companies, near-term margin pressure seems inevitable,\" said Vishal Punmiya, lead analyst for consumer staples \u0026 discretionary at YesSecurities. He added that rising palm oil and crude prices, alongside inflation in agricultural and food commodities, are weighing heavily on their gross margins.\"Volumes should gradually recover as rural demand improves on a lower base,\" Punmiya added, \"but inflationary pressures might force staggered price hikes over the next few quarters, starting from Q3.\"Of the 15 stocks on the FMCG index, 12 declined while three advanced on Thursday. Over the past month, the index shed 11.3%, compared to a 5.9% decline in the benchmark index. \"Valuations in the FMCG sector remain a concern, limiting upside potential for stocks. While downgrades aren't expected, earnings cuts can't be ruled out,\" Tolia said, noting that significant demand recovery is unlikely before Q4, with gradual improvements expected in Q3. Punmiya said that FMCG sector valuations are still trading at a premium, although companies like Dabur, Hindustan Unilever, and Tata Consumer Products are relatively more attractive within the sector.Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2024 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
