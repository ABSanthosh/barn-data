Markwayne Mullin said Monday.\"They are claiming that they moved some material,\" Mullin said, referring to Israel and Iran, respectively. \"Our intelligence report says they didn't,\" the Oklahoma Republican said in an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\"In fact, we actually believe they stored more of it in Fordo because they believe Fordo was impenetrable,\" said Mullin, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \"They thought it was a safe place to be.\"But, he added, \"We have the ability to destroy things that people think were undestroyable. And so we think we did a really good job.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageLesser of two evils: Why China won't mind a closure of the Strait of HormuzIran's parliament backs blocking Strait of Hormuz.

Maxar Technologies | Via Reuters\"We have made it very clear, President Trump has made clear for 10 years, that we will not allow Iran, the world's sponsor of terror, to have a nuclear weapon any way whatsoever,\" he said.Mullin said that did not mean the U.S. would insert American troops into Iran.\"That means that we can do this through the air, and work with our allies to finish the job,\" he said.\"And I believe that we may have to work with Israel to continue to maybe get rid of some of their stockpiles as things come up.\"Mullin's comments raise the prospect of a more sustained U.S. engagement in the conflict between Israel and Iran than Trump is publicly discussing so far.The president did not seek authorization from Congress before undertaking the strikes over the weekend.But pressure on the White House to more fully engage with Congress could grow this week, especially if it appears the United States is preparing for a second major U.S. military action.",
