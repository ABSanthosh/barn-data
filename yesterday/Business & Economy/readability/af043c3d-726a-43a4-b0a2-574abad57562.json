  "description": "In this episode of the Duck Tape Marketing Podcast, I had the pleasure of being interviewed by Sara Nay. Sara Nay is the COO of Duct Tape Marketing. She oversees day-to-day operations to support the growth of Duct Tape Marketing and the Duct Tape Marketing Consultant Network. She focuses on strategic planning, goal setting, and directing the company's operations in support of its goals. And on a personal note, she’s also my daughter—which makes me “Pop Pop” to her kids! In this episode, we change it up a bit as I become the interviewee. We explore my journey into entrepreneurship, why I started my own business, why I didn’t work for someone else (the answer will surprise you), my passion for small businesses, and the evolution of marketing over the years. I reveal lessons from my polar opposite parents and my former fears about running a business. We also dive into my favorite topic: the impact of AI on small businesses, the opportunities and challenges they face, and the importance of curiosity and innovation in business. I wrapped up with a glimpse into my future aspirations—what might life look like after Duct Tape? And I answered the timeless question: What’s my all-time favorite business book?
