  "text": "The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has rolled out a new ‘comprehensive special audit’ framework for India’s aviation sector. With this, it aims to move beyond siloed safety assessments and carry out integrated evaluations across airlines, airports, maintenance firms, training institutes, and ground handling agencies. “Traditionally, regulatory and safety oversight functions within Indian aviation have been conducted in silos, with different directorates (of DGCA) performing inspections and audits specific to their respective domains. These activities include planned/unplanned surveillance inspections, random spot checks and ramp inspections. They primarily assess compliance and safety within individual aviation segments,” the regulator stated. The new framework, described as a “significant paradigm shift”, aimed to evaluate the aviation ecosystem holistically, moving away from fragmented oversight models. On June 12, Air India’s London-bound AI171 flight crashed shortly after take off from Ahmedabad, killing 229 passengers, 12 crew members, and 34 people on the ground. Also Read Issued on June 19, the DGCA circular mentioned the need for “a 360-degree evaluation of the aviation ecosystem, reflecting both its strengths and areas needing improvement.” Going beyond the annual surveillance audits currently in place, the special audits will be carried out by multidisciplinary teams led by senior officials from the regulator. These teams will include personnel from various DGCA divisions — such as flight standards, air safety, airworthiness, aerodrome standards, and air navigation — and may also bring in external experts when needed. The audits will examine three broad areas: the effectiveness of an organisation’s safety management system (SMS), the robustness of its operational practices, and compliance with regulatory provisions. Each audit will involve a combination of techniques, including on-site inspections, document reviews, interviews with operational staff, safety data analysis, and training record checks. “These audits will be over and above the regulatory audits carried out according to the annual surveillance program,” the DGCA said. They will apply to all major players in the civil aviation system, not just airlines and airports but also maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) providers, training academies, and even entities that manage emergency response systems and supply chains. The regulator will initiate these audits either routinely, such as through annual assessments or post-implementation reviews, or in response to specific triggers like serious incidents, regulatory violations, or findings by UN body International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). In urgent cases, audits may begin without notice. Otherwise, entities will be given between three and 14 working days to prepare. Audit findings will be categorised by severity. The most critical ones will require corrective action within seven days, while others may be resolved over 30-90 days.  “Audited entities must submit a corrective action plan… detailing root cause analysis, remedial actions, preventive measures, implementation timelines, and success metrics,” the circular stated. The DGCA has also made it clear that enforcement will follow in cases where findings are not addressed. “Non-compliance… may result in progressive enforcement actions, including advisory guidance, formal warnings, operational restrictions, financial penalty, suspension, or revocation of licenses,” it noted. To encourage transparency, the regulator has promised confidentiality of audit findings in line with international norms. “The special audit upholds a confidential approach, aligned with ICAO Annex 19 principles, to foster open reporting and positive safety culture,” it said. The new audits, DGCA said, will “provide a holistic evaluation of the aviation sector, meticulously examining safety, operational efficiency, and regulatory compliance.” The goal is to proactively identify systemic vulnerabilities, enhance resilience, and ensure alignment with international standards and India’s own aviation safety objectives.",
