In this article, we are going to take a look at where Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) stands against other top energy companies. After posting notable gains in the first three months of 2025, the energy sector witnessed significant declines in April, primarily due to the ongoing global trade war sparked by President Trump’s tariffs and the prospects of an economic slowdown. The overall energy sector has now slid by around 3.8% since the beginning of the year, against a decline of about 5.8% by the wider market. Unsurprisingly, the downturn is led by the oil and gas sector, which has fallen by over 15% YTD. READ ALSO: 11 Best Solar Energy Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds The primary reason behind this fall is the declining global price of crude oil, caused by the continued uncertainty surrounding global trade, demand fears, and the recent decision by OPEC+ to increase supply. The West Texas Intermediate crude price is currently hovering at a multi-year low level of just under $62, down by over 25% YoY. To make matters worse, the International Energy Agency recently cut its 2025 oil demand growth forecast by 300,000 barrels per day compared to last month, warning the world to ‘buckle up’ amid the escalating trade tensions. That said, there are sectors in the energy industry that are still significantly bullish, with liquified natural gas being a prime example. The United States of America is already the largest LNG exporter in the world, with exports growing consistently over the last decade. Still, the industry continues to boom after it received significant support from the Trump administration, which has made boosting America’s fossil fuel sector its primary agenda. According to Wood Mackenzie, 15.5 million tons per annum (MTPA) of long-term LNG offtake contracts were signed in the first quarter of 2025, following a record 81 MTPA last year. These numbers are expected to spike in the coming months after more and more countries are looking to export American LNG to narrow their trade gap with the US, following a tariff threat by the White House. Another important growth driver for the energy sector is the ongoing AI boom and its accompanying power-hungry data centers. According to a study by the American Clean Power Association, electricity demand in the US is expected to surge by 35-50% by 2040, driven by domestic manufacturing growth, data centers, and mass electrification. A primary candidate to satisfy this huge demand is natural gas, which is clean, reliable, and abundant. According to energy data provider Enverus, a total of 80 new gas power plants could be constructed in America by the end of the decade. That said, natural gas is not as cheap as it was a year ago, as prices have surged by around 36.6% over the last 52 weeks.",
