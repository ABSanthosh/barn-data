  "text": "In This Article: Alphabet Inc_ and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone by IgorGolovniov via Shutterstock Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google has long been a pillar of strength in the tech world, powered by its hugely profitable Search business. Over the past decade, the stock has delivered a remarkable 452% return, reflecting years of steady growth and dominance. But lately, that growth narrative has hit some turbulence. This year, GOOGL stock has struggled to break out as concerns mount over the future of search in an artificial intelligence (AI) world. For the first time since 2015, Google’s search engine market share has dipped below 90%, raising alarms among investors. Moreover, the rise of generative AI models — particularly OpenAI’s ChatGPT, where users get answers directly — has sparked fears that Google’s ad-based model could also lose its edge. Even so, Google isn’t standing still. The company is aggressively integrating AI across its ecosystem, aiming to revamp Search and future-proof its broader portfolio.

The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now! Beyond Search and ads, the company has a range of businesses — from cloud computing to hardware — that keep its fundamentals intact. So, with the tech giant’s second-quarter earnings just around the corner, here’s a closer look at GOOGL stock. Backed by multiple revenue streams, Google’s dominance is undoubtedly hard to ignore. The California-based company now operates across a broad digital spectrum, from cloud services and ad-based streaming to self-driving tech and healthcare innovation. In fact, Google was one of the early adopters of AI, well before it became a mainstream trend. It has since woven AI into much of its product ecosystem. The company commands a hefty market capitalization of about $2.2 trillion. But despite its early strides in AI and long-standing dominance in tech, Google stock hasn’t kept up in 2025. Shares of GOOGL are down about 4% year-to-date (YTD), well behind both the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index's ($NASX) 7% gain and the broader S\u0026P 500 Index's ($SPX) roughly 6% gain over the same period. www.barchart.com As questions swirl around Google’s ability to hold its ground in the fast-moving AI race, the tech giant is starting to look cheap. Currently trading at just 18.9 times forward earnings, Google’s price sits well below its own five-year average. The gap is even wider when compared to its “Magnificent Seven” peers, such as Microsoft (MSFT) at 33 times and Amazon (AMZN) at 36 times forward earnings. For a company with Google’s scale and reach, the current pricing stands out as a potential opportunity in an otherwise expensive tech landscape.",
