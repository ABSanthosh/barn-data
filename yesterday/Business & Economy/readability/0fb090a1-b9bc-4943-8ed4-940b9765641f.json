Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesWASHINGTON — Thousands of troops descended on Washington, D.C., on Saturday, with tanks filling the streets and helicopters overhead, as President Donald Trump staged a military spectacle for the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary.But the military parade, which Trump has repeatedly said he wanted since his first term, unfolded against the backdrop of an act of political violence earlier in the day that has left lawmakers and the American public reeling.Earlier Saturday, a still-at-large suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, allegedly impersonated a police officer and shot and killed a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband in what authorities are calling a \"politically motivated assassination.\" Another Democratic legislator and his wife were also shot in a separate attack by the same suspect.U.S. President Donald Trump waves. next to first lady Melania Trump following the military parade to commemorate the U.S. Army's 250th Birthday, on the day of U.S. President Donald Trump 79th birthday, in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 14, 2025. Carlos Barria | ReutersMeanwhile, thousands of Trump's opponents gathered across the nation in mass protests as part of \"No Kings Day\" demonstrations to speak out against his administration's policies.Protests took place in major cities, including Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and Philadelphia, as well as smaller towns. Some of the demonstrations saw clashes with counter-protesters and law enforcement.Demonstrators hold signs as they march down Dolores street protesting the Trump administration during the \"No Kings\" rally in San Francisco, California on June 14, 2025, on the same day as President Trump's military parade in Washington, DC.Nic Coury | AFP | Getty ImagesA demonstrator waves an U.S. flag in front of mounted police officers during a No Kings Day protest against President Donald Trump's policies, in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 14, 2025. Leah Millis | ReutersIn Minnesota, law enforcement officials warned the public not to attend the planned demonstrations across the state following the targeted shootings of the Democratic state lawmakers. But protesters still showed up, with some saying the attacks that transpired made the demonstrations more important.Still, Trump, whose 79th birthday fell on the same day, has long pushed for a military parade in the nation's capital — an idea that was swatted down during his first term by Pentagon officials.Now, with full control of government and an administration stacked with loyalists, Trump got the grandiose show of force he's always envisioned, even amid the critics.Armored vehicles drive during the Army 250th Anniversary Parade in Washington, DC on June 14, 2025.

Mandel Ngan | AFP | Getty ImagesThroughout the day, there were military demonstrations and a wreath laying at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.The event was said to be the largest military parade in Washington, D.C., since 1991, when President George H. W. Bush held a military parade at the conclusion of the Gulf War.Soldiers dressed in Revolutionary War uniforms march in the military parade on June 14, 2025 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesThe dramatic split-screen between D.C. and cities across the nation comes against the backdrop of ongoing tensions in Los Angeles that have escalated since Trump deployed the National Guard to quell protests over immigration enforcement polices.The celebration also comes as tensions continue to escalate in the Middle East, following Israel's attacks on Iran's nuclear sites, and Iran's retaliatory attacks.One particular sticking point for critics of the D.C. event, including some Republicans, was its high price tag. All told, the event could cost up to $45 million, according to an Army spokesperson.But Trump said the cost is \"peanuts compared to the value of doing it,\" in an interview with NBC's \"Meet the Press\" last month.\"Every other country celebrates their victories, it's about time America did too,\" Trump said during remarks at the parade.The celebration wrapped up late Saturday with a fireworks display that went off promptly after the parade ended despite the looming threat of storms.Fireworkds explode over the Thomas Jefferson Memorial on the day of a military parade to commemorate the U.S. Army's 250th Birthday in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 14, 2025.
