  "text": "As the 2024 U.S. presidential election fast approaches, endorsements from high-profile billionaires have been pouring in from both sides of the aisle. Taylor Swift’s announcement that she will be voting for Vice President Kamala Harris marked another billionaire backing for the Democratic nominee, who currently trails former President Donald Trump in endorsements from the mega-rich. Currently, Harris has the support of almost a dozen billionaires, including familiar names such as hedge fund manager and philanthropist George Soros and investor and television personality Mark Cuban.  Meanwhile, Trump’s Republican ticket has garnered the support of nearly 20 billionaires ahead of November. Tesla owner Elon Musk is not only backing Trump for president, but he says he is also ready to serve in Trump’s cabinet. The outspoken X owner is also planning a new government task force, which Trump has said Musk will lead.  While some have merely shared their statements on social media, others have hosted campaign events or let their massive donations speak for themselves.  Fortune compiled a list of all the billionaire endorsements thus far in the 2024 election cycle: Billionaires who have backed Kamala Harris Jason Alden—Bloomberg/Getty Images George Soros – Founder, Soros Fund ManagementSoros, known for throwing millions at philanthropic and political causes, immediately supported Harris after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. His son and heir, Alex Soros, posted about their support in July.  It’s time for us all to unite around Kamala Harris and beat Donald Trump. She is the best and most qualified candidate we have. Long live the American Dream! 🇺🇸 🗽 #Harris2024 pic.twitter.com/KG09YnWHZK— Alex Soros (@AlexanderSoros) July 21, 2024 “It’s time for us all to unite around Kamala Harris and beat Donald Trump,” the post read. “She is the best and most qualified candidate we have. Long live the American Dream!” According to Bloomberg, Soros’ Democracy PAC has given $10 million to Future Forward PAC and $5.6 million to American Bridge this election cycle. Simon Dawson—Bloomberg/Getty Images Jonathan Gray – President, BlackstoneHe may have been considered for Trump’s Treasury Secretary in 2016, but Gray is a major Democratic donor. He supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, donated to multiple Democratic candidates in 2020 and hosted an event for Biden before he dropped out this year. Despite being known as a Swiftie, Gray announced his support earlier than Swift, reportedly donating to the Harris campaign shortly after she became the presumptive nominee. John Lamparski—Getty Images Marc Lasry – Co-founder, Avenue Capital GroupEarlier this year a person familiar confirmed to Bloomberg that Lasry would be supporting Harris. Lasry reportedly hosted an event for Harris at his New York apartment during the 2020 presidential election cycle and as of July was considering holding another for 2024. Tom Pennington—Getty Images Mark Cuban – Entrepreneur; Former Principal Owner, Dallas MavericksEntrepreneur and Shark Tank star Mark Cuban has been very open about his support of Harris on social media, even debating billionaire Trump supporter Elon Musk online.  On the @tim_walz choice, I think people who don’t like it are missing the lesson of the switch to Harris. She went from worst to first as people got to know her. It’s not a reach to think the same thing will happen with Walz. People are tired of the ideologues and hate…— Mark Cuban (@mcuban) August 6, 2024 Cuban’s public support has been so strong, some even speculated earlier this summer that Harris might pick Cuban for vice president. He later praised Harris for selecting Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. Scott Kowalchyk—CBS/Getty Images Melinda French Gates – Co-founder, Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates FoundationGates is known for her philanthropy as well as her support of Democratic causes, and was quick to support Harris’s bid for president. “I feel like Kamala, I was happy to endorse,” French Gates told Stephen Colbert on The Late Show in July. “I’ve worked with her before, she knows what we need in society and she’s using her voice against those issues already on the campaign trail, and I knew she would.” Michael M. Santiago—Getty Images Reed Hastings – Co-founder and former CEO, NetflixThe billionaire quickly cut a $7 million check to a super PAC supporting the Harris campaign this year, enthusiastically backing the Democratic nominee after calling for Biden to drop out.  Hastings said earlier in the summer that the U.S. needed “a vigorous Democratic leader to beat Trump and keep us safe and prosperous” and Biden should “step aside.” David Paul Morris—Bloomberg/Getty Images Reid Hoffman – Co-founder, LinkedIn; Venture CapitalistTech billionaire Reid Hoffman signed onto a letter with fellow venture capitalists, including Cuban, declaring their support for Harris’ White House bid. That letter called Harris’ election, “the best way to support the continued strength, security and reliability of our democracy and economy.” Jerod Harris—Getty Images for i.am.angel Foundation Ron Conway – Founder, SV AngelConway, a Silicon Valley  “super angel” and philanthropist, signed the same VCs for Kamala letter as Hoffman and Cuban.  The tech community must come together to defeat Donald Trump and save our democracy by uniting behind Vice President @KamalaHarris as the Democratic nominee for President. I have known Kamala for decades, and she's been a fighter, a leader, and an advocate for the tech ecosystem…— Ron Conway (@RonConway) July 22, 2024 He wrote on X that the tech industry must come together to, “defeat Donald Trump and save our democracy.” He also wrote: “I have known Kamala for decades, and she’s been a fighter, a leader, and an advocate for the tech ecosystem.” David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images Sheryl Sandberg – Former COO, Facebook (Meta)Sandberg has repeatedly spoken out in support of Harris following her entry to the race. In an Instagram post, Sanberg said she was “thrilled” to back Harris.  “She will defend women’s rights — and all Americans’ rights — from the Oval Office with a determined, compassionate focus,” Sandberg said. Photo By Vaughn Ridley/Sportsfile for Collision via Getty Images Vinod Khosla – Founder, Khosla Ventures; Co-founder, Sun MicrosystemsKhosla, a Silicon Valley billionaire, spent over $3 million in 2020 campaigning against Trump and is supporting the Democratic nominee again this year. Khosla joined the list of over 850 venture capitalists supporting Harris, the same list signed by Cuban, Hoffman, and Conway.  Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for MTV Taylor Swift – Award-winning singer/songwriter Swift endorsed Harris after the debate, calling out the use of AI earlier in the election cycle to share a fake video of Swift supporting Trump.  “Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation,” Swift wrote in an Instagram post announcing her vote. “It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. Billionaires who have backed Donald Trump Photo by Sylvain Gaboury/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images Bill Ackman – CEO and Founder, Pershing Square CapitalBillionaire hedge fund manager Ackman announced on X that he would be endorsing Trump for president in 2024, writing he hasn’t “lost it” but made the decision “rationally.” I am going to formally endorse @realDonaldTrump. I came to this decision some time ago as many @X followers have already understood from my supportive posts of Trump and my criticisms of @POTUS Biden. The reason why I have not yet formally done so is that I want to explain my…— Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) July 14, 2024 “I assure you that I have made this decision carefully, rationally, and by relying on as much empirical data as possible,” he said at the time.  Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images Douglas Leone – Former Managing Partner, Sequoia CapitalLeone cited immigration and the growing deficit as key reasons he would be supporting Trump this fall. I have become increasingly concerned about the general direction of our country, the state of our broken immigration system, the ballooning deficit, and the foreign policy missteps, among other issues. Therefore, I am supporting former President Trump in this coming election.— doug leone (@dougleone) June 3, 2024 In a tweet from June, Leone said he’d grown “increasingly concerned” about these issues and would be casting his ballot for the former president. He previously donated to Trump’s 2020 campaign but distanced himself after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Jared Siskin—Patrick McMullan/Getty Images Elon Musk – CEO, Tesla and X (formerly Twitter)Musk officially endorsed Trump in July after an attempted assassination on the former president, sharing his support on X. “I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,” Musk posted at the time, adding later the same day: “Last time America had a candidate this tough was Theodore Roosevelt.” He has remained an outspoken supporter of Trump’s campaign, with his America PAC recently launching a series of ads in September warning that “Kamala and the crazies,” will win if you don’t get out to vote. Geoffrey Palmer – Real Estate MagnateReal estate billionaire Geoffrey Palmer has reportedly donated more than $3 million to PACs affiliated with the Trump campaign this year. He’s been major Republican financial supporter for years.  The Beverly Hills resident supported Trump in 2016, threw $500,000 at Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign and has donated to multiple Republican campaigns and committees. Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images Harold Hamm – Founder, Continental ResourcesThe billionaire Oklahoma oil tycoon has long brought in millions for Trump’s campaigns as well as past GOP candidates. Hamm was even an energy adviser to Romney ahead of 2012.  This election cycle, Hamm has donated again to Trump and appeared at his events, helping to rally the oil industry behind the campaign.  Photo by Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post via Getty Images Isaac Perlmutter – Former Chairman and CEO, Marvel EntertainmentIt’s no surprise that Perlmutter, who advised Trump’s administration, said he’d be shelling out money for the former president’s 2024 campaign this year. According to OpenSecrets, he’s donated $10 million toward the election cycle.  The billionaire, famous for reviving Marvel comics and selling it to Disney, also donated to Trump in 2020.  Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images J. Joe Ricketts – Chairman, TD AmeritradeAccording to Business Insider, Ricketts and his wife gave more than $20 million to GOP causes in 2020, and are again supporting the party in 2024. In fact, Ricketts’ son is in politics himself. Former Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts was appointed to the U.S. Senate after former Sen. Ben Sasse opted to retire and is expected to be elected to finish the term. Photo by Sylvain Gaboury/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images John Catsimatidis – Owner, Red Apple GroupCatsimatidis, the head of the real estate group Red Apple and a radio talk show host, has a long history with Trump and has backed him financially in the past.  In an appearance on NPR earlier this year, Catsimatidis argued that Trump is the better candidate for businesses in the U.S. and defended his legacy. He’s been active this election cycle rallying CEOs to support Trump’s campaign.  Photo by Rob Kim/Getty Images John Paulson – Hedge Fund ManagerPaulson has been an outspoken Trump supporter leading up to the 2024 election, and is a GOP megadonor. He’s been especially critical of Harris’ capital gains tax and other economic proposals. “If they do implement a 25 percent tax on unrealized gains, that would cause mass selling of almost everything — stocks, bonds, homes, art. I think it would cause a crash in the markets and a pretty quick recession,” Paulson predicted recently.  Aaron M. Sprecher/Bloomberg via Getty Images Kelcy Warren – Founder, Energy TransferAccording to Politico, the pipeline mogul has donated $5 million this election cycle to elect former President Trump. He joined a number of oil industry billionaires who have come out in force to support Trump’s campaign, falling into Trump’s top 10 donors, according to OpenSecrets. Hannah Beier/Bloomberg via Getty Images Linda McMahon – Co-founder, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)McMahon has praised Trump as a “job creator” and appeared at the Republican National Convention (RNC) this summer to endorse and support Trump’s bid for the White House.  Formerly Trump’s Small Business Administration leader, McMahon donated in 2016 to his first campaign. She has a relationship with Trump going back to 2007, when he appeared on WWE’s flagship event WrestleMania.   Photo by Paul Morigi/Getty Images Liz Uihlein – Co-founder, UlineAfter initially supporting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Uihlein family reportedly said they would be donating to Trump’s election bid in March. The megadonors are known for supporting campaigns and causes aligned with conservative values, and backed Trump in the two previous elections, before initially turning to DeSantis for 2024. Uline Inc. is the number two donor to Trump’s campaign, reportedly shelling out more than $10 million toward his reelection.  SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images Miriam Adelson – Casino Billionaire and Republican MegadonorPredictably, Miriam Adelson, who previously shelled out $500,000 for Trump’s legal fees, is supporting the former president again in 2024.  The Adelson Clinic for Drug Abuse Treatment \u0026 Research has reportedly donated $5 million to the Trump campaign this election cycle. She is a longtime Trump ally and was awarded the presidential medal of freedom in 2018. Photo by Denise Truscello/WireImage Phil Ruffin – Casino MagnateRuffin has been described as one of Trump’s “closest friends” and is a co-owner of the Trump International Las Vegas hotel. Ruffin donated to Trump’s 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns as well as his 2024 bid, reportedly giving more than $800,000 this year.   Photo by Michael Ostuni/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images Stephen Schwarzman – CEO, BlackstoneSchwarzman, who supported Trump in the 2016 election and became a trusted adviser in his office, is again supporting Trump in 2024 despite hoping for fresh blood from the GOP earlier in the cycle.  He called a vote for Trump a “vote for change” when announcing in May that he would vote for the Republican candidate this fall.  Photo by Carley Margolis/FilmMagic Steve Wynn – Former Casino MogulWynn, a longtime Trump ally, supported the former president in 2016 and 2020 and is again voting for Trump in 2024. Wynn reportedly donated more than $800,000 to be a co-chair at a Palm Beach fundraiser hosted by Paulson earlier this year. The fundraiser, which was also attended by Hamm and Johnson, benefitted the Trump 47 Committee. From National Network for Safe Communities Timothy Dunn – Texas Oil BusinessmanTexas billionaire Tim Dunn is another oil industry tycoon who has thrown his support behind Trump. According to Politico, Dunn has spent more than $30 million advancing conservative issues in his home state alone, and cut a $5 million check toward Trump’s election.  It’s hard to find photos of the reclusive billionaire Tim Mellon, but he comes from a long line of rail money starting with Andrew Mellon (pictured).Andrew Mellon pictured –Photo by Keystone/Getty Images Timothy Mellon – Republican Mega-donorMellon, heir to the Mellon Bank fortune, was a top 2020 donor to Trump and, unsurprisingly, he’s backing the GOP candidate again this time around.  In July, the “reclusive” megadonor donated $50 million to a pro-Trump super PAC, according to Politico. It’s hard to find photos of the billionaire, so we’ve opted for a photo of his grandfather Andrew Mellon, a former U.S. Treasury Secretary. According to a report by the BBC, Mellon typically donates to Republicans but has occasionally contributed to Democrats, including New York progressive Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s 2018 campaign. Photo by Brooke Sutton/Getty Images Woody Johnson – Heir, Johnson \u0026 Johnson; Co-owner, New York JetsJohnson, who served as ambassador to the United Kingdom from 2017 to 2021 and is a longtime friend to Trump, threw his support and finances behind the campaign this year.  “Americans remember how good it was or how much better it was on the border, and inflation, and gas prices, and grocery prices, all that, during the Trump administration, and they want to get back there,” Johnson said in a Fox News appearance in early 2024. “So I think the most important thing is getting the former president back in the White House, which looks like it’s happening.” This list will be regularly updated with newly announced billionaire support.
