The move reflects strong financial performance, with robust Q1 loan and deposit growth, and comes amid a 21% stock rally over the past year.ETMarkets.comHDFC Bank's board will meet on July 19, 2025. They will consider issuing bonus shares for the first time. Mumbai: India's largest private sector lender HDFC Bank said on Wednesday its board will meet on July 19 to consider a landmark proposal-the issuance of bonus shares for the first time in the bank's three-decade history. The HDFC Bank stock, which has climbed more than 23% in a year, has the largest weighting on the Nifty, accounting for nearly a seventh of the index.If approved by the board and shareholders, the bonus issue would mark a significant milestone for India's most-valued lender, signalling management's confidence in its financial position and long-term growth trajectory. A wider equity base enhances capital-market liquidity for the stock, which is a favourite with overseas investors and is the centrepiece for most bulge-bracket funds taking exposure to Indian financial assets.\"HDFC Bank's decision to consider issuing bonus shares can be seen as an effort to enhance liquidity in the F\u0026O market, enabling investors to take positions more easily,\" said Ajay Bodke, independent market analyst. HDFC Bank shares have shown a strong performance, rising more than 23% over the last 12 months. Shares of HDFC Bank closed Wednesday at ₹1,996 apiece in the broader equity markets.The bank has a market capitalisation of ₹15.30 lakh crore. In addition, board would consider a proposal for a special interim dividend on bank's equity shares for FY26 on Saturday. In terms of dividends, bank has declared ₹22 per share as a final dividend for FY25, the highest since listing.Foreign institutional and portfolio investors hold the largest share in HDFC Bank, accounting for 48.84% of the total equity. Domestic institutional investors own 36.04%, with mutual funds making up the majority at 25.61%. Resident individuals hold around 12% of the bank's shares, while the remaining stake is distributed among various other corporate entities. Operationally, the bank is expected to report robust growth in the first quarter of FY26. According to proforma figures published by HDFC Bank ahead of formal earnings, its loan book expanded 6.7% quarter-on-quarter to reach ₹26.5 lakh crore, while deposits rose 16% year-on-year to ₹27.6 lakh crore, reflecting healthy business momentum.Live EventsAnalysts expect bank to report a 4% to 6.3% increase in profit after tax for June quarter, driven by strong growth in core operating income and stable asset quality. The board meeting on July 19 will include the consideration and approval of the financial results for Q1FY26.\"If gap in loan and deposit growth has been offset by rundown in borrowings, margin trajectory may turn out to be healthier relative to peers-if the bank has continued to run down low-yielding corporate credit,\" said Pranav Gundlapalle, head of India financials at Bernstein.( Originally published on Jul 16, 2025 )Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
