Today, we breathe a sigh of relief,\" Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, told CNBC.Japan's public broadcaster NHK reported that auto tariffs on Tokyo will be lowered to 15% from the current 25% — levied across countries — citing a Japanese official. Auto exports to the U.S. are a cornerstone of Japan's economy, making up 28.3% of all shipments in 2024, according to customs data.Japanese exports of automobiles, which include cars, buses and trucks, to the U.S. fell 26.7% in June, extending May's 24.7% plunge.The country's overall exports to the U.S. — its second largest trading partner — stood at 10.3 trillion yen ($70.34 billion) between January to June, a 0.8% year-on-year drop.In his tariff letter sent to Japan earlier this month, Trump had threatened 25% levies on the country's exports from Aug. 1, one percentage point higher from the 24% rate announced during his April 2 \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.Tuesday's announcement comes just days after Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's governing coalition lost its majority in the country's upper house elections that had raised worries of undermining the country's negotiating position with the U.S.HSBC said in a note Monday that \"For Prime Minister Ishiba, a favourable U.S. trade deal could help stave off a no-confidence motion or internal challenge from the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party].\"Ishiba had said after the upper house loss that he would stay on as prime minister, but Japanese media outlet Yoimuri reported early Wednesday that he would decide whether to stay on his position after assessing the progress of the tariff negotiations, according to a Google translation of the report in Japanese.",
