  "text": "Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. In This Article: Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the world. Corporations are racing to establish themselves as leaders in the field, while investors want to cash in by putting their hard-earned money into the most promising AI companies. However, prominent names in this fast-growing space have seen their shares soar in the past two years, and the valuations of some have become quite expensive. Two AI healthcare stocks -- Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: RXRX) and Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC) -- have lagged the market over the past year. But if these companies' ambitions (AI-related and otherwise) materialize over the long run, they could deliver market-beating returns. Are the stocks worth investing in? Recursion Pharmaceuticals is using AI to speed up the slow and expensive process of drug discovery and development. It can take a decade or longer for a medicine to go from inception to the market, and typically costs hundreds of millions of dollars. New therapies have a 20-year patent life in the U.S., so after a decade of clinical trials, there's usually only one decade left to generate revenue until a product loses patent exclusivity and starts facing cheaper competition from generics or biosimilars. Imagine cutting the time to launch therapies by a quarter or half. It would mean less money spent on the process, longer commercial patent life, higher sales from the drugs, higher margins for drugmakers, and likely lower prices for consumers. That means Recursion's ambitions could revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry. The company uses an AI-based operating system (OS) that tests compounds against a vast library of human genes to find the most promising compounds to send to clinical studies. Recursion has already shown some promising early results, and has spent far less time and money than the industry average to get its current pipeline candidates from the early stages of discovery to human clinical trials. Furthermore, Recursion has partnered with several pharmaceutical giants, including Roche Holding and Bayer, to develop medicines. These collaborators could help the mid-cap biotech with funding. Recursion currently has over half a dozen programs in studies. Why, then, is the stock lagging the market? Despite its ambitious project, the company has yet to launch a single medicine. It doesn't even have candidates in phase 3 (late-stage) clinical trials. So it will be a while before it proves its platform can produce the results investors want. In the meantime, a lot can go wrong for the company, including clinical and regulatory setbacks, other drugmakers developing AI-powered methods of speeding up drug discovery, or competitors undercutting its plan to license its OS down the line. In short, while Recursion's shares provide massive upside if its master plan works, there are also significant downsides and risks. Invest accordingly.",
