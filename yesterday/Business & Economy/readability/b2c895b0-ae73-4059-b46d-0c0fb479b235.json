  "description": "Baidu launched in 2000 as a search engine platform. Two decades later, it’s become one of the few companies in the world that offers a full AI stack. Its core businesses span mobile, cloud, intelligent driving and other growth initiatives, and its products and services have attracted hundreds of millions of users and hundreds of thousands of enterprise customers. Leading all of that is co-founder, CEO, and chairman Robin Li. He explains how Baidu has built generative AI into its business – including their AI chatbot, ERNIE Bot. Robin also shares the technology trends he’s keeping an eye on – from AI bubbles to robotaxis – and how he anticipates these fast-moving changes will transform our world.",
