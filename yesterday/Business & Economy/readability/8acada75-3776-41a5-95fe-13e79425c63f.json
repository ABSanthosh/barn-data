The notice was signed by Kent Myers, the city administrator for Starbase who recently accepted the job, according to ValleyCentral.com.Representatives for Starbase and SpaceX did not respond to requests for further information on Thursday.A \"type-C municipal corporation,\" Starbase was officially formed earlier this month after Musk's aerospace and defense contractor prevailed in a local election.
