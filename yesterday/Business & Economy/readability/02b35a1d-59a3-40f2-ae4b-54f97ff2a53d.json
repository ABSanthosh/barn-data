In 2024, foreign investors pulled out over ₹16,000 crore from the sector.ETMarkets.comFinancial services faced the maximum brunt of foreign selling this year, but witnessed some respite as the pace of selling came down in the second-half of February.Mumbai: Overseas investors sold Indian equities worth ₹20,564 crore across 18 sectors between February 16 and 28, according to data from NSDL.The automobile sector witnessed the highest outflows in the second-half of the month as these investors dumped shares worth ₹3,279 crore after selling to the tune of ₹690 crore in the first-half of the month. In 2024, foreign investors pulled out over ₹16,000 crore from the sector.\"The tariffs being imposed by the US are likely to affect the auto sector, making it difficult to maintain exports and in addition, the valuations in the sector had also run up last year,\" said U R Bhat, co-founder, Alphaniti. \"This is likely to have driven the foreign selling in the sector.\"Healthcare and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sectors saw outflows of ₹2,996 crore and ₹2,568 crore, respectively. While they purchased shares worth ₹1,534 crore in the healthcare sector in the first 15 days of the month, they sold shares worth over ₹4,000 crore in the FMCG sector.Bhat said that since healthcare also has a significant exposure to the US, the tariffs have dampened foreign sentiment on this segment as well.\"The demand has not picked up in the FMCG sector as anticipated and the expensive valuations are expected to have led to outflows,\" said Bhat.AgenciesFinancial services faced the maximum brunt of foreign selling this year, but witnessed some respite as the pace of selling came down in the second-half of February.Overseas investors offloaded shares worth Rs 1,647 crore after divesting Rs 24,949 crore worth shares in the sector in January. “Most large private banks and NBFCs have performed well, led by recent measures taken by the RBI to improve liquidity,” said Saurabh Patwa, portfolio manager and head of research, Quest Investment. The worst of the asset quality issues in personal credit is nearing to bottom out which is also supportive for the sector, he said. Foreign investors sold shares worth Rs 1,820 crore in the construction materials sector and withdrew over Rs 1,200 crore from capital goods, consumer durables and power sector in the second half of the month. Overseas investors pumped Rs 7,261 crore across five sectors, with the telecommunication sector witnessing the highest inflows worth Rs 5,661 crore after they bought shares worth Rs 2,337 crore in the first half of the month. Promoter Group Indian Continent Investment Limited sold shares of Bharti Airtel worth Rs 8,485 crore in a block deal on February 18. Analysts said that the change in shareholding in telecom major, Bharti Airtel has led to the infusion of foreign funds in the sector in the second half of the month. Global investors purchased shares worth Rs 1,362 crore and Rs 112 crore respectively in sectors earmarked as ‘Others’ and Information Technology (IT). “In the next one month or so, easing of the US dollar and some finality in terms of Trump’s trade tariffs, as also a potential peace deal, could spark a risk-on sentiment on emerging markets among overseas investors,” said Bhat. These factors are likely to stabilise over the next month or so and some inflows in India can be anticipated as it is relatively better placed, he said. “It is difficult to ascertain the near-term direction of foreign flows despite valuations turning fairly attractive in some sectors given the uncertainty at macro level creating volatility at currency level as well as crude impacting several businesses in the near term”, said Patwa.Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
