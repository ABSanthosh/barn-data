On March 24, 2000, the S\u0026P 500 Index posted a record level it wouldn't see again until 2007. Three days later, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index also closed at an all-time high, the last time it would do that for more than 15 years.Those peaks marked the end of an electric run that started with the blowout initial public offering for Netscape Communications Corp, which started trading in August 1995.
