Delta and other airlines have said they plan to cut capacity after the peak summer travel season, which ends around mid-August.Here is what United Airlines reported for the quarter that ended June 30 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $3.87 adjusted vs. $3.81 expectedRevenue: $15.24 billion vs. $15.35 billion expectedUnited's second-quarter revenue rose 1.7% from a year earlier to $15.24 billion, below the $15.35 billion analysts expected. Net income dropped 26% to $973 million, or $2.97 a share. Adjusting for one-time items, United reported $1.27 billion, or $3.87 a share.Unit revenue dropped 4% in the quarter. The decline was most pronounced in domestic passenger revenue per seat mile, which fell 7% year over year. International revenue has been a bright spot for airlines, but there was some evidence of weaker pricing power, with United's Europe unit revenues down 2.2% on the year.Premium revenue was up 5.6% over last year, a sign that customers continue to pay up for more comfort on board, while basic-economy class sales were up 1.7% year over year.United expects to post adjusted earnings of between $9 and $11 per share in 2025 compared with the $10 a share analysts had expected. Amid economic uncertainty this spring, United in April had taken the the unusual step of issuing two earnings scenarios — $11.50 to $13.50 a share in a stable environment and $7 and $9 a share in a \"recessionary environment.\"For the third quarter, United said it expects adjusted earnings of $2.25 and $2.75 a share, within analysts' expectations.The carrier said operational constraints at Newark Liberty International Airport, a major United hub, this year hit its second-quarter pretax margin by 1.2 points and forecast a third-quarter impact of 0.9.The Federal Aviation Administration in May cut flights at Newark because of air traffic controller staffing shortages and other issues.American Airlines and Southwest Airlines are scheduled to report results next week.Read more CNBC airline newsAirport lounges, Europe and premium class are on the table, Southwest CEO saysTrump wants to bring manufacturing jobs back.
