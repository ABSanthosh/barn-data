  "text": "Mumbai: The recent bounce in mid-cap and small-cap shares may have more legs in the days ahead. Short-term technical indicators are pointing to a further run-up of 5% in their indices after having gained roughly 5% in the previous three trading sessions though market participants are doubtful whether the recovery is more permanent after the sharp sell-off in the previous six months.On Wednesday, the Nifty Midcap 150 index was up 2.37%, Small-cap 250 rose 2% and Microcap 250 gained 2.2% at close. All three indices are up between 4.7% and 5.2% in the last three days, against the 2.25% upmove in the benchmark Nifty 50.
