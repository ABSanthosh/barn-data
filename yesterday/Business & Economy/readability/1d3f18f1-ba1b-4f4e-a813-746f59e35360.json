That’s especially true for retirees who are juggling different retirement accounts, which might include a 401(k), a tax-deferred Individual Retirement Account (IRA), and a Roth IRA alongside taxable savings and investment accounts. In reality, this is a great time to start planning for next year’s return. How you manage your retirement accounts this April will have repercussions on the tax bill you’ll face next April. “Tax planning is long term, not day-to-day or even year-to-year,” Ed Slott, a certified public accountant in New York and an expert on IRAs, told Yahoo Finance. “Now is the time to look at things that bothered you this year when the market had a downturn and how many years you are away from retirement, then start thinking about having more cash available so you don't have to sell in a declining market,” he said.

The S\u0026P 500 (^GSPC) ended 2024 with a gain of 23%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) jumped nearly 13%, and the Nasdaq (^IXIC) ballooned close to 29%. For retirees, that translates to higher required minimum distributions (RMDs) or withdrawals from IRAs and workplace plans this year. “The stock market was near an all-time high on Dec. 31, and that date is locked in no matter where your portfolio stands today,” Slott said. “So even though right now your account balance is going up and down like a yo-yo, you'll still have to take your RMD based on the higher balance.” Your RMD is generally taxed as ordinary income in the year it’s taken, so the taxes on that money will come due next April. Slott, however, sees a bright side: “While more money is coming out, it is still at historically low tax rates. And if you can get it out while rates are low, you're still doing well. You still end up ahead.” The marginal tax rate in 2025, for example, is 24% for incomes over $103,350 ($206,700 for married couples filing jointly $100,525). “The key to keeping more of your hard-earned money protected from taxes is to always pay taxes at the lowest rates, which may be right now,” he said. You must take your first RMD for the year in which you reach age 73. However, you can delay taking the first RMD until April 1 of the following year. If you reach age 73 in 2025, you must take your first RMD by April 1, 2026, and the second RMD by Dec. 31, 2026. More on that shortly.",
