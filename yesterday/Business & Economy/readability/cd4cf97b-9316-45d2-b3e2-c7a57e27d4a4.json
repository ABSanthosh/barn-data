Crypto and other coins in the sector have soared after Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election, ushering in a potentially more crypto-friendly administration. Here’s a look at the history of Dogecoin and how much lucky investors who bought back in 2013 would have now. What Happened: Dogecoin was created in 2013 by Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus. The coin was meant to be a satirical coin to mock Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), but over time has gained support from a loyal community. Palmer bought dogecoin.com and connected with Markus, who had previous experience with altcoins, including making a coin based on the Bells currency in the Animal Crossing video game. The duo made the coin in just a couple hours, with Markus previously saying much of the time on development was spent changing the font of the coin to Comic Sans. Don’t Miss: 1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ — this platform touts returns as high as 12.5% APY and is giving $100 in welcome rewards if you sign up today. Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% — Investors like Bill O’Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence. The cryptocurrency was based on the iconic Doge meme that stars Kabosu, a Shiba Inu dog. A profile for Dogecoin was created on Bitcointalk.org on Dec. 6, 2013. A subreddit for Dogecoin (r/Dogecoin) was created on Dec. 8, 2013. The coin opened for trading on Dec. 15, 2013. One of the coin's first uses was as a tipping bot on Reddit. The price of Dogecoin went from around $0.0002 to $0.002 in two weeks, marking a significant return for early investors. The coin saw a rise in 2017 alongside other altcoins before falling in price by the end of 2018. One of the biggest public supporters of Dogecoin over the years has been Tesla CEO Elon Musk. A 2019 Twitter post that elected Musk as the fictional CEO of Dogecoin saw the billionaire declare “Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency.” See Also: Dogecoin millionaires are increasing – investors with $1M+ in DOGE revealed! Musk has tweeted multiple times about Dogecoin since then, and several of his companies have even accepted the cryptocurrency as payment. Musk’s acquisition of social media platform Twitter, now known as X, has led to several price spikes for Dogecoin, with some believing the coin will be integrated into the platform.",
