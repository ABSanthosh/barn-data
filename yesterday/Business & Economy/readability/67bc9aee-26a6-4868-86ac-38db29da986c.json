  "text": "The Duct Tape Marketing Podcast with John Jantsch In this episode of the Duct Tape Marketing Podcast, I tackle a critical topic that small businesses face today: the marketing leadership gap. Many small businesses struggle with disconnected marketing efforts, scattered strategies, and stagnant growth, not due to a lack of tactics but because they lack marketing leadership to tie it all together. As we look ahead to the future of marketing in 2025, I dive into why traditional solutionsâ€”like hiring agencies or fractional CMOsâ€”often fall short and what businesses must do to implement a long-term marketing strategy that drives sustainable business growth. This episode uncovers how a marketing system combined with leadership can transform small businesses into scalable, successful enterprises. Key Takeaways: Most small businesses fail at marketing not because of a lack of tools or tactics but because of a marketing leadership gap. Strong marketing leadership ensures all efforts align with business goals and drive measurable growth. Fix foundational issues first: improve messaging, optimize your website, and focus on building trust through content marketing. Implement a repeatable marketing system that delivers consistent, long-term results. Treat marketing as an asset, not a cost, to increase business value and make your company more attractive for future opportunities. Marketing leadership as a service (e.g., fractional CMOs) offers small businesses and agencies an affordable way to gain strategic guidance. AI can improve marketing execution but cannot replace the leadership and strategy required for success. Agencies should shift their approach to think like architects of marketing systems, not just contractors executing tasks. Businesses must focus on long-term marketing strategies instead of quick, disconnected efforts. Closing the marketing leadership gap will help small businesses achieve sustainable business growth and success in 2025 and beyond.
