(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other stock picks with huge upside potential. Louis Moore Bacon is the founder, Chairman, and principal investment manager of Moore Capital Management, a global investment management firm that provides services to institutional and high-net-worth clients through diversified hedge funds and specialized funds that focus on global fixed-income and emerging markets. It was established in March 1989 and is headquartered in New York City with offices in London and Hong Kong. He holds an MBA in Finance from Columbia Business School and a BA in American Literature from Middlebury College. Bacon’s investment philosophy is based on risk management and capital preservation principles. His trading strategies are focused on macroeconomic trends and fundamental analysis of the markets. Bacon emphasizes diversification, which allows him to invest across different geographies and asset classes. He is known for his contrarian investment style and takes positions against prevailing market sentiment. Moore Capital Management is a hedge fund with 4 clients and discretionary assets under management (AUM) of $33.20 billion, as reported in the firm’s Form ADV dated 19 November 2024. Their last reported 13F filing for Q4 2024 included $8.70 billion in managed 13F securities and a top 10 holdings concentration of 25.53%. He believes that there are opportunities to profit from mispricing that come with volatility or fear. Louis Moore Bacon is also the Founder and Co-Chair of The Moore Charitable Foundation, which was established in 1992 to support conservation-focused nonprofits dedicated to preserving land, water, and wildlife habitats. Bacon has received several awards in this regard, including the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership (TRCP) Lifetime Conservation Achievement Award and the Audubon Medal. To compile the list of billionaire Louis Bacon’s 10 stock picks with huge upside potential, we sifted through Q4 2024 13F filings of Moore Global Investments from Insider Monkey. From these filings, we checked each stock’s upside potential from CNN and ranked the stocks in ascending order of this upside potential. We have also added Moore Global Investments’ stake in each company and the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. Note: All data was sourced on May 2. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).",
