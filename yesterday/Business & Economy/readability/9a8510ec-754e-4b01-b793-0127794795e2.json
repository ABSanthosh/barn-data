Do withdrawals from my pre-tax IRA and/or 401(k) accounts made before I turn 73 count toward my RMDs? Or do RMDs start at 73 without regard to prior withdrawals? I’m 70 now and still working and collecting Social Security, but plan to retire in 2024. – Luis Unfortunately, withdrawals from an IRA or 401(k) before age 73 do not count toward your eventual required minimum distributions (RMDs). However, you still may be able to reduce your RMDs if that’s your goal. Do you need additional help planning for RMDs or managing your tax liability in retirement? Speak with a financial advisor today. RMDs are designed to force you to take withdrawals from tax-deferred retirement accounts so that the money can be taxed and avoid growing tax-deferred indefinitely. Understanding that this is the expressed purpose of RMDs can help you put these mandatory withdrawals in context as you plan around them. In other words, if you’re worried that RMDs will interfere with your distribution plan and increase your bill – that’s the point. Of course, RMDs won’t impact everyone. Some people will need to withdraw more than the minimum amount to cover their living expenses. As you alluded to in your question, RMDs now start at age 73. The RMD age, which was previously 70.5 and then 72, rose to 73 under the SECURE 2.0 Act. The age will increase again in 2033, rising to 75 for people who turn 74 after Dec. 31, 2032. (If you’re preparing for RMDs, consider talking through your strategy with a financial advisor.) A 73-year-old retiree calculates his RMD for the year. The RMD calculation process is pretty straightforward in both concept and application. The idea is that RMDs spread your distributions out over your life expectancy so there’s no remaining balance in your account when you pass away. To calculate your mandatory distribution, you simply divide your account balance from Dec. 31 of the previous year by the life expectancy factor that corresponds with your age. You can find these on one of several IRS life expectancy tables. You then withdraw that amount from your account(s) annually. To illustrate how this works, let’s assume someone is 78 years old in 2025. Since they’re married to someone who isn’t more than 10 years younger than them, our hypothetical retiree would refer to Table III (Uniform Lifetime) and see that their life expectancy factor is 22. Since it’s 2025, this person would need their account balance from Dec. 31, 2024. Let’s assume it was $500,000. They would then simply divide $500,000 by 22 and get an RMD of $22,727. This is the amount our hypothetical retiree would need to withdraw throughout the course of 2025. They will repeat this calculation the following year with their new account balance and updated life expectancy factor.",
