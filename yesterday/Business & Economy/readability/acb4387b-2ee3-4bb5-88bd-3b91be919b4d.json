  "text": "In This Article: High-yield funds can be risky. In a perfect world, every ultra-generous dividend yield would be a direct result of strong businesses generating lots of excess cash profits. In the real world, they're more often related to low stock prices and businesses in deep financial trouble. As a result, high yields tend to be paired with disappointing price charts and modest total returns, at best. What if I told you that one of the largest income-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the market today combines rich yields with impressive fund-price gains? The JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ: JEPQ) checks both of those shareholder-friendly boxes -- and many more. The Premium Income ETF is a very young fund, launched in May 2022. You may also have skipped it in the massive sea of income-generating ETFs because it's an actively managed fund. Passive index funds tend to come with lower annual fees, so it makes sense to start your fund-screening process with that criterion. But this JPMorgan instrument may be well worth its 0.35% management fee. Here's a quick rundown of the fund's unique qualities: The Premium Income ETF's experienced management team relies on data science to select high-income stocks from the growth-oriented Nasdaq 100 market index. 54% of the portfolio is currently invested in information technology and communication services -- two market sectors closely related to the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom. The top 10 holdings include the entire list of \"Magnificent 7\" stocks -- proven winners with very large market caps. Some of those tech giants don't pay dividends, but the fund managers generate monthly income from them in other ways. Annual dividend yields currently stand at 9.3% after rising above 12% over the summer. It has a massive $20.7 billion of assets under management, despite its short market history. Investors were quick to embrace this promising new fund: JEPQ Total Assets Under Management data by YCharts. The dividend-boosting methods include some risky tricks, such as selling short-term call options to generate payments out of volatile stocks. That's great when it works, but could also result in weak fund performance and lower yields in a persistent market downturn. The fund was launched a couple of months before this bull market started. It has not yet been tested in a weak economy, which could unleash the downsides of option-based investing tactics. The 0.35% management fee may not look like much, but it's far above the 0.06% average of the 10 largest ETFs today and even further ahead of low-cost funds such as the Vanguard S\u0026P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO). The fee could actually make a big difference in the long run. The Vanguard fund's 0.03% annual fee adds up to 0.3% in a decade, while the Premium Income ETF's fees would total 3.6% over the same period.",
