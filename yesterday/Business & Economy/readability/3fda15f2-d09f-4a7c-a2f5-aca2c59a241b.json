The plan to change the way Open Interest or outstanding positions of futures and options are calculated will stay, they said.IANSSebi is also expected to drop a controversial proposal to impose intraday trading limits in futures and options.Mumbai: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is likely to ease some of the curbs it proposed on equity futures and options trading in February following opposition from market participants, people familiar with the matter said.A panel appointed by the regulator recommended easing limits on index and single-stock derivatives and doing away with the suggestion to impose a penalty in the event of a transgression in the trading limits. The plan to change the way Open Interest or outstanding positions of futures and options are calculated will stay, they said.The regulatory rethink also comes against the backdrop of a sharp decline in F\u0026O volumes from their peak over the last six months.Position limitsThe net positional limit for a trader or an entity in index options may be raised from ₹500 crore to ₹1,500 crore on either side (calls and puts), with a gross limit- total value of all positions- of ₹10,000 crore, said the people in the know. Intraday trading is likely to remain exempt from these limits. The proposal will allow traders to take large bets on index optionsLive EventsSebi, in its February circular, had proposed capping the position limit for a trader or an entity at ₹500 crore for options and ₹1,500 crore for futures in an attempt to prevent large players from controlling the market. Brokers and traders had said that the limits were restrictive and could impact liquidity. In the futures segment, the revised positional limits may be set based on the category of market participants such foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), mutual funds, proprietary traders, and others. The overall position cap for trading members-including client and proprietary positions-may also be increased, the people said.Intra-day limits \u0026 monitoringSebi is also expected to drop a controversial proposal to impose intraday trading limits in futures and options.\"You should not use regulations as a substitute for supervision and surveillance,\" said the person quoted earlier.Instead, the regulator plans to strengthen real-time oversight. It will monitor intraday positions across the market four times a day at random intervals. If an individual or entity is found to be holding positions beyond acceptable thresholds, it would trigger a surveillance or supervisory check, rather than a regulatory penalty.Globally, stock exchanges do not impose hard intraday limits but retain the authority to step in when risks appear elevated. \"Instead, they always have the right to call up a trading member or an individual participant and tell them, you are running very high positions, see a concentration risk and take it out, or to dig deeper to see if there is any manipulation happening,\" the person said.OPEN INTEREST CALCULATION The proposal to change the way Open Interest is calculated from the existing “notional value” method to a “delta-based” model will stay. The new method considers the sensitivity of an option to its underlying asset and is seen as a more accurate reflection of market risk“The regulatory thinking is moving to delta, which would be a far better metric than notional,” said a person familiar with the development. A key issue with the current method is that it assigns full notional value even to far out-of-the money options, many of which have little or no intrinsic value. This can artificially inflate the market-wide position limit (MWPL) in certain stocks, pushing them into F\u0026O ban periods. “So a lot of people do completely out-of-the-money options with zero value, clog up what we call the market-wide position limit, and therefore it goes into a ban period,\" the person said. \"Now some of this could also be manipulative.”He added that a delta-based system would significantly reduce the number of spurious F\u0026O bans. “If it does go into ban, it is for a good reason.” Even in index options, the new approach would allow market participants and regulators to more easily spot large exposures. “The possibility of spurious manipulation or concentration risk will reduce dramatically if the ecosystem starts to look at this in delta terms,” the person added. Rajesh Palviya, head—technical and derivatives at Axis Securities, said the current method tends to overstate market risk by giving equal weight to all options, regardless of their likelihood to be exercised. “Traditional open interest calculations based on notional value can inflate the perceived risk of a market, especially with options that are far out of the money. The delta-based approach mitigates this issue by giving less weight to these options, which are less likely to align with the movements of the underlying asset,” Palviya said.Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
