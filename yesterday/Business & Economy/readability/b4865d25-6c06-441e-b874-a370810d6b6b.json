He added: \"What we have learned is that the tariffs are higher than anticipated, higher than almost all forecasters predicted, and that it is unclear right now how this all will play out.\"  Powell further said that he is not going to leave the chairmanship of the central bank before his term comes to an end. \"I fully intend to serve all of my term,\" he said. Powell's current term will culminate in 2026.Also Read Meanwhile, Powell also said that the \"uncertainty\" over the economy and government policy is hampering businesses. \"People are just... they just are kind of waiting for clarity and cannot tell you when that will pass, but you know, ultimately it will pass,\" Powell said. He added that being cautious is the right thing to do as of now. However, Powell said that he does not see a conflict between the central bank's mandates on jobs and inflation right now.
