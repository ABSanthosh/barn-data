Dividend yields - a measure of how much a company pays out in dividends each year compared to its stock price - of these firms range between 3% and 6%. AgenciesDuring periods of slower growth, dividend yield stocks often emerge as attractive investment options, said analysts.“High dividend yield stocks typically offer stable income through dividends, which can be particularly appealing when overall market growth is subdued,” said Sahil Shah, chief investment officer, Equirus. “These stocks, by their nature, tend to have lower earnings growth, but in a slowing earnings environment — combined with relatively high market valuations — investors may seek refuge in value stocks that provide reliable yields while maintaining a similar growth trajectory.” Vedanta, which declared a 2,950% dividend in FY24, delivered a 73% return in 2024. Stovec Industries, a small-cap company specializing in textile machinery and consumables, which doled out a 1,740% dividend in FY24, returned 23% in 2024. “This cautious sentiment is likely to persist in the near term, making it an opportune time to adopt a value-buy strategy including focusing on dividend-paying stocks,” said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services. “Companies that pay high dividends typically dominate their industries, exhibit strong leadership qualities, generate healthy cash flows, and maintain robust balance sheets, thereby mitigating the impact of cyclical downturns.”Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2024 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
