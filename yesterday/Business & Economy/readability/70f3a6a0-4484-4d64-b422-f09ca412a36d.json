The app is available on Apple's App Store and is currently ranked 12th in the food and drinks section. Albinder Dhindsa, CEO of Blinkit, announced the launch of the application on social media platform X: \"With @bistrobyblinkit, we will offer our customers high-quality, canteen-type food, delivered hot in 10 minutes. We believe high-quality food that is more accessible has the potential to induct more customers into ‘outside of home’ food consumption. To achieve this, we are innovating on the entire food supply chain with Bistro. At Bistro, no preservatives or food processors are used in preparing the food, nor is it microwaved processed food. Instead, we are investing in infrastructure and R\u0026D to create tasty dishes within 5 minutes or less,\" Dhindsa wrote on X.

The NRAI is already involved in an ongoing case with the antitrust body, accusing both platforms of anti-competitive behaviour. Zomato’s Blinkit and Swiggy recently introduced independent apps named Bistro and Snacc, respectively. The NRAI claims this amounts to operating private labels, which could create challenges for restaurant partners, as per the report.",
