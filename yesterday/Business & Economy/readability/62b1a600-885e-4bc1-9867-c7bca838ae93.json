In November, NSE issued four bonus shares for every one share held.D-Mart founder Radhakishan Damani owns around 1.58% of the bourse, of which Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) is the largest shareholder - at 10.72% stake as of November 2024. Stock Holding Corporation and SBI Capital Markets each hold approximately 4.4%, while State Bank of India owns 3.23%. Among foreign investors, Aranda Investments holds a 5% stake. AgenciesThe Forum had initially filed a writ petition on May 3, 2024, seeking court intervention in the NSE IPO process. In response, Sebi said that NSE needed to reapply for the no-objection certificate, which the exchange did in August.The investors further contend that post-listing, NSE would be subject to stricter regulatory scrutiny than now, as is standard for listed entities.Sebi opposed the petition arguing that People Activism Forum has no locus standi to file the petition.Further, if the Court passed the order, it could set a precedent for third parties to challenge orders or directions passed by Sebi. The market regulator cited the pendency of Colocation issues for not permitting NSE to proceed with the IPO. Sebi also remarked that NSE has not recently made any express request for the issuance of NOC for a listing of shares. Therefore, Sebi denied that it is delaying listing permission to NSE. An email query sent to Sebi and NSE did not elicit any response until Sunday press time. NSE, in its reply, clarified that NSE had complied with Sebi’s regulatory framework and directives and expressed its no objection to the relief sought by People Activism Forum. NSE further clarified that it had regularly sought NOC and listing permission and brought on record the latest correspondences dated May 14, 2024, and August 27, 2024, addressed to Sebi to substantiate the same. The matter is scheduled to be listed on March 6, 2025, for a final hearing. In 2016, NSE filed a draft prospectus with Sebi for its IPO. Around the same time, Sebi started investigating the co-location scam. In 2019 the bourse had withdrawn its IPO documents amid the investigation. But in 2022, NSE again approached Sebi but was advised not to proceed. On September 9, 2024, Sebi closed the co-location case against the NSE on grounds of lack of sufficient evidence.
