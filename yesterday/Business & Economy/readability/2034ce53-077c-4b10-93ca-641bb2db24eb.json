  "text": "Mumbai: After Adani Green Energy (AGEL) refinanced a $1.06 billion construction facility which was due March 2025, bond analysts are recommending that investors suggest targeted bond buybacks to the Adani Group to reduce risk and manage the large volume of debt coming due.The new facility is reportedly borrowed at a weighted life of 19 years, and now carries a funding cost of 9.2%. The loan it refinanced was taken in 2021 to develop wind-solar hybrid projects.\"While the successful outcome of AGEL's loan refinancing is well expected by the market, the lower cost of AGEL's debt refinancing is an encouraging read for the group's recent developments,\" Nomura wrote in its latest credit report. \"We recommend investors to provide suggestions to the Adani Group to conduct bond buybacks for facilitating the Adani risk recycling and addressing the bond maturity wall across the Adani complex,\" it said.On the ongoing US regulatory developments as well as long-running investigations under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCAP) and other enforcement actions involving AGEL, analysts said recent shifts in the US are positive, especially the Trump administration's February 25 executive order directing the Department of Justice to pause FCPA enforcement until new guidelines are issued.The Adani Group's US dollar bonds have rebound following a positive update by Fitch Ratings. The Adani Green 4.625% 2039 and 6.2% 2042 bonds have moved up 2 basis points after the update. After Adani Green's construction facility of $1.06 billion, Adani Airport Holdings is facing two repayments-$250 million in May 2025 and $150 million in September 2025. Adani Energy Solutions faces a $500 million repayment on its secured US dollar bonds in August 2026.JP Morgan said in its latest credit research note that Adani Green has made progress since US regulators indicted the company in November 2024, especially with refinancing the construction facility which shows the company has access to local funding. Because of these improvements, JP Morgan has upgraded its view on the company's bonds, now rating them \"overweight\", and expects the bonds to perform well.",
