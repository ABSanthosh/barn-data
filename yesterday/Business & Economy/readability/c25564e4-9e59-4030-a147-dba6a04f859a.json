  "text": "The Hinduja Group, which promotes IndusInd Bank, may be compelled to pledge up to 80% of its holdings in the bank if the stock price drops below Rs 600 per share, according to an analysis by Macquarie Capital.Analysts warn that the risk of pledging could extend to other Hinduja-led entities as the group works to repay debt and reduce collateral. IndusInd International Holdings (IIHL), led by the Hinduja Group and owning a 15% stake in the bank, has already pledged about 50% of its shares to Barclays Bank PLC and Deutsche Bank AG in exchange for a loan.“At the current market price, the promoter stake is approaching critical levels. At Rs 600, nearly 80% of the promoter's shareholding will need to be pledged to maintain the same value of pledged shares as of December 22, when they last topped up,” said Anjali Sinha, Head of India Equity Sales, in a note. “We are uncertain about the specifics of the contract between the promoters and lenders. If there are any thresholds that require an increase in the coverage ratio, it could pose a problem.”Sinha also raised concerns about the impact on the Hinduja Group's ability to repay debt and reduce the pledged percentage, especially considering their borrowing to delist Reliance Capital. She questioned whether there might be risks for other Hinduja-led entities, such as Ashok Leyland, where promoters hold about 50% of the stake, with 30% of it pledged.As of December 20, 2024, when the stock was valued at Rs 930 per share, the pledged stake was worth approximately Rs 5,500 crore, providing a 2:1 cover for a loan facility of about Rs 2,600 crore. The stock of IndusInd Bank ended the day’s trade at Rs 684.70 apiece.In a television interview, Ashok Hinduja, Chairman of IndusInd International Holdings Limited and promoter of IndusInd Bank, stated that the group is prepared to inject capital into the bank if necessary.“If additional capital needs to be raised, the promoter is ready to invest,” Hinduja had said on Monday. “We are awaiting approval from the RBI to increase our stake from 15% to 26%. While the policy is already in place, it is still under review by the regulator. Once we receive the approval, the process will move forward smoothly.”IndusInd Bank has been at the center of controversy after the RBI granted a one-year extension to its CEO, Sumant Kathpalia. Just days later, the bank revealed it had uncovered accounting discrepancies in its derivatives portfolio, which are expected to result in a Rs 1,600 crore hit to its balance sheet.The Hinduja-promoted lender, which has already seen a decline of over 50% in the last six months, faced an extraordinary 27% drop in its stock price on Tuesday after the management disclosed that the discrepancies spanned multiple years.",
