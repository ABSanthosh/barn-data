(TSXV: NCX) (NorthIsle or the Company) is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement with Paradigm Capital Inc. (Paradigm) as lead agent and sole bookrunner on behalf of a syndicate of agents (collectively, the Agents), including Agentis Capital Markets Limited Partnership as co-lead agent, in connection with a best efforts private placement financing (the Offering) for total proceeds of approximately $9,000,376, consisting of up to 10,836,000 common shares of the Company that qualify as flow-through shares (within the meaning of subsection 66(15) of the Income Tax Act (Canada)) (the CFT Shares) to be issued to subscribers at a price of $0.646 per CFT Share, and up to 5,264,000 common shares of the Company (the Non-FT Shares) at a price of $0.38 per Common Share (the Non-FT Issue Price). In addition, the Company has granted the Agents an option (the Agents' Option) to sell up to 2,415,000 additional Non-FT Shares at the Non-FT Issue Price for additional aggregate gross proceeds of up to $917,700, exercisable not later than 48 hours prior to the Closing Date (as defined below). The term Offering includes the additional Non-FT Shares that may be issued on the exercise of the Agents' Option, if any. This financing is anticipated to include participation from fundamental institutional investors and existing cornerstone shareholders. The Company will use an amount equal to the gross proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the CFT Shares to incur eligible Canadian exploration expenses that qualify as flow-through critical mineral mining expenditures as such terms are defined in the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the Critical Minerals Qualifying Expenditures). The Company will incur the Critical Minerals Qualifying Expenditures on or before December 31, 2025, and renounce (on a pro rata basis) all such expenditures in favour of the subscribers of the CFT Shares with an effective date no later than December 31, 2024 in accordance with the Income Tax Act (Canada). The proceeds from the sale of the Non-FT Shares will be used for exploration, project development and for general corporate purposes. Closing is expected to occur on or about December 5, 2024, or other such date as the Company and the Agents may agree (the Closing Date). The Offering is subject to regulatory approval, including the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange, and all securities issued pursuant to the Offering will have a hold period of four months and one day. The Offering will be conducted on a private placement basis pursuant to applicable exemptions from the prospectus requirements of Canadian securities laws under National Instrument 45-106 â€œ Prospectus Exemptions, and in such other jurisdictions as may be mutually agreed upon by Paradigm and the Company pursuant to applicable exemptions from the prospectus, registration or other similar requirements in such other jurisdictions such that no prospectus, registration statement or similar document are required to be filed by the Company in any such jurisdiction. The securities have not been, and will not be, registered under the Unites States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the U.S. Securities Act), or any U.S. state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States without registration under the U.S. Securities Act and all applicable state securities laws or compliance with requirements of an applicable exemption therefrom. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities in the Unites States, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.
