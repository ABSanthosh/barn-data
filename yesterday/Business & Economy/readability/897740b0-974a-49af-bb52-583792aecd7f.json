  "description": "Serial entrepreneur Marcia Kilgore — founder of brands like Beauty Pie and Soap \u0026 Glory — joins Guy on the Advice Line, where they answer questions from three early-stage founders managing uncertainty and risk. Today, we meet Victor in Fort Worth, the co-founder of a Mexican-style sweets and treats venture who wonders if he should focus on expanding brick-and-mortar operations, retail presence, or both. Then Lydia in Seattle, a former disease researcher who is ready to grow her small batch botanical skincare line, but needs help overcoming her fear of failure to get to the next step. And Jack in San Francisco, the founder of a custom bike bag and accessories brand who’s trying to figure out how to maintain customer excitement throughout the entire purchasing process so as not to lose momentum. Thank you to the founders of Sol Dias, Clērstory, and Wompy Bikes for being part of our show. If you’d like to be featured on a future Advice Line episode, leave us a one-minute message that tells us about your business and a specific question you’d like answered.
