SELECTED LINKS FROM THE EPISODE Connect with Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Website | Podcast | Twitter | Instagram | Facebook Health Protocols and Lifestyle Interventions Sauna Use: Linked to a 65-66% lower risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease when used four to seven times weekly. Optimal protocol: 174°F (79°C) for 20 minutes. Temperatures above 190°F (88°C) may be less beneficial. Hot Baths: Provide similar cardiovascular benefits to sauna use, with daily hot baths linked to 28% lower cardiovascular disease risk. Protocol: 104°F (40°C) water temperature for 20 minutes. Intermittent Fasting (IF) — Specifically 16:8: Time-restricted eating with a 16-hour fast and eight-hour eating window, shown to improve metabolic health, blood sugar control, and activate cellular autophagy. Extended Fasting: Water-only fasts lasting seven to 30 days that can trigger profound autophagy and provide anti-inflammatory benefits, though requiring medical supervision for safety. Fasting-Mimicking Diet (FMD): A low-calorie, low-protein, plant-based eating pattern for five consecutive days that aims to provide fasting benefits while allowing some food intake. Norwegian 4×4 Protocol: High-intensity interval training method involving four minutes at 85-95% maximum heart rate followed by three minutes active recovery, repeated four times to maximize VO2 max improvements. Zone 2 Training: Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise performed at conversational pace below the lactate threshold, optimizing fat oxidation, and building aerobic base for endurance and longevity. Tabata: A form of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) that involves short, intense bursts of exercise followed by brief rest periods. Seniors CrossFit: Adapted functional fitness program emphasizing scalable movements, strength training, and community engagement specifically designed for older adults to maintain independence and health. Key Health Concepts and Terms VO2 Max: The maximum rate of oxygen consumption during exercise, considered the gold standard measure of cardiorespiratory fitness and a key predictor of longevity. APOE4: A genetic allele that significantly increases the risk for Alzheimer’s disease, with those carrying two copies developing brain pathology predictably by age 55. Klotho: A longevity-related protein that acts as an anti-aging factor, boosted by exercise and vitamin D, and associated with improved cognitive function and extended lifespan. Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs): Protective proteins activated by heat stress such as sauna use that help repair misfolded proteins, prevent protein aggregation, and provide cellular protection against damage. Autophagy and Mitophagy: The body’s cellular cleanup processes that clear out damaged proteins, organelles, and mitochondria, activated by fasting and intense exercise to maintain cellular health. NRF2 Pathway: A genetic pathway that controls the cellular response to oxidative stress and inflammation, strongly activated by compounds like sulforaphane from cruciferous vegetables. Ketosis / Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB): A metabolic state where the body uses fat and ketones for fuel, with BHB acting as a clean energy source and signaling molecule with anti-inflammatory effects. Glymphatic System: The brain’s waste clearance system that is most active during deep sleep, helping clear amyloid-beta plaques and other toxic proteins from brain tissue. Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs): Harmful compounds formed when sugar binds to proteins, causing tissues such as blood vessels and organs to become stiff and contributing to aging and disease. Microplastics and Nanoplastics: Pervasive environmental contaminants found in food, water, and packaging that can cross biological barriers including the blood-brain barrier and potentially cause cellular damage. Sick Quitter Hypothesis: A confounding factor in alcohol studies where people who quit drinking due to illness are miscategorized as healthy non-drinkers, potentially skewing research results on alcohol’s health effects. Supplements, Compounds, and Products Centrum Silver: A multivitamin specifically formulated for adults 50+ that was used in randomized controlled trials showing it could reduce global cognitive aging by ~2 years and episodic memory aging by ~5 years in older adults. Vitamin D: Recommended dose is individualized based on blood tests, aiming for a level of 40-60 ng/mL. A common starting dose is 5,000 IU/day, but some may need more. Omega-3 Fish Oil: Crucial for brain health. A dose of ~2 grams/day is mentioned. For APOE4 carriers, the phospholipid form (found in salmon roe, krill oil, or created by the body at higher doses) is recommended for better brain delivery. Ubiquinol (Coenzyme Q10): A form of CoQ10 that supports mitochondrial health. Dr. Patrick gives it to her father for his Parkinson’s disease. The VESIsorb formulation by Pure Encapsulations is mentioned for higher bioavailability (and cost). Sulforaphane: A compound from cruciferous vegetables (especially broccoli sprouts) that activates the NRF2 pathway, boosting glutathione and aiding detoxification of pollutants like benzene and BPA. Best taken on an empty stomach unless it causes GI distress. Creatine Monohydrate: The “gold standard” form. Recommended for muscle performance (increasing exercise volume) and cognitive benefits. A 5g/day dose saturates muscles, while higher doses (10-20g/day, in divided doses) are suggested for cognitive enhancement and combating sleep deprivation. Curcumin: Used as a natural anti-inflammatory alternative to NSAIDs for headaches and delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). The Meriva (phytosomal) formulation is recommended for bioavailability, with a suggested dose of four 500mg capsules (2g total). Magnesium: Essential for over 300 enzymes, including those that convert Vitamin D. Recommended forms include magnesium glycinate, citrate, and malate. Magnesium Threonate is mentioned for its potential to cross the blood-brain barrier. Typical supplemental dose is around 300-450mg/day. Lutein and Zeaxanthin: Polyphenols important for eye and brain health, found in multivitamins and supplements studied in the AREDS2 trials. Exogenous Ketones: Mentioned as a potential intervention for cognitive decline in aging, as seen in some case studies. The ketone monoester used in studies is noted as very expensive. Psilocybin: Discussed as a non-addictive alternative to ketamine for treating depression and for its potent anti-inflammatory effects, which can be achieved at sub-perceptual doses. Momentous: Brand for NSF-certified creatine, used by Tim. Avmacol: The brand of sulforaphane supplement Dr. Patrick gives to her mother. Xyrem: Oral prescription solution that may be used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in adults and children aged seven years and older with narcolepsy. Thorne: Recommended for Meriva Curcumin and NSF-certified Creatine Monohydrate. Pure Encapsulations: Recommended for O.N.E. Omega-3 Fish Oil, VESIsorb Vitamin D3, and Magnesium Glycinate. Xymogen: Recommended for high-DHA fish oil and Magnesium Threonate. Big Berkey: Water filtration system. Blue Bottle Coffee: Noted for using plastic-free, sugarcane-lined cups that don’t leach microplastics into hot beverages. Foods and Beverages Broccoli Sprouts: The most potent dietary source of sulforaphane, containing 10-100 times higher levels than mature broccoli plants, with powerful anti-cancer and detoxification properties. Sardines and Salmon Roe: Excellent dietary sources of omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA in highly bioavailable phospholipid form, with 40-70% of DHA in salmon roe being phospholipid-bound compared to just 1-3% in regular fish. Xylitol Gum/Mints: Sugar alcohol sweetener with proven dental health benefits, reducing harmful oral bacteria and preventing tooth decay when consumed at 6-10 grams daily, though most commercial gum contains problematic “gum base” polymers. Heavy Cream / MCT Oil: Fat sources commonly used in “dirty fasting” that have minimal impact on insulin levels compared to protein or carbohydrates, with MCTs rapidly converting to ketones while preserving most fasting benefits. People Dr. Mark Mattson: A neuroscientist and adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine known for his pioneering research on intermittent fasting and its effects on brain health and neuroplasticity.

RHONDA PATRICK QUOTES FROM THE INTERVIEW “After two years of taking the multivitamin, they had improved cognition on a battery of different tests that equated to reducing global cognitive aging by about two years. And on top of that, they reduced their episodic aging by five years. Almost five years. It was 4.8 years.” — Dr. Rhonda Patrick “A 70-year-old makes about four times less vitamin D than their former 20-year-old self.” — Dr. Rhonda Patrick “There have now been enough studies that have come out looking at cardiorespiratory fitness in the sense of VO2 max and how people with a higher cardiorespiratory fitness have a five-year increased life expectancy compared to people with a low cardiorespiratory fitness.” — Dr. Rhonda Patrick “People end up eating about 200 fewer calories per day when they’re doing some form of intermittent fasting.” — Dr. Rhonda Patrick “If you have a low cardiorespiratory fitness and you go anywhere above that from low to low normal, it’s associated with a two-year increased life expectancy. And people with a low cardiorespiratory fitness actually have a higher all-cause mortality that’s comparable or worse than people with known diseases like type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease or smokers, for example. So in other words, being sedentary is a disease and we need to think about it as a disease and we should be trying to train to improve our VO2 max.” — Dr. Rhonda Patrick “Over the last few years, intermittent fasting has kind of gotten a bad rap because people now equate it with, ‘Oh, loss of muscle mass. I’m going to be catabolic.’ Well, in order to be in a repair mode, you actually do need to be in a catabolic mode.” — Dr. Rhonda Patrick “50 percent of the US population has insufficient levels of magnesium. So you’re talking about a coin toss here, right? One out of two.” — Dr. Rhonda Patrick “A woman has a lifetime risk of one in eight of getting breast cancer. So if you have a room with eight people, one of those women, if you’re at a dinner party, and eight women are there, then one of those women will come down and be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime. So when you add alcohol consumption on top of that, if you’re talking about moderate alcohol consumption, that risk can go to one in six, which is very significant for lifetime risk.” — Dr. Rhonda Patrick",
