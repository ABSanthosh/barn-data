  "text": "Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) was one of the best-performing stocks of 2024. A strong start to the year for the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered enterprise software company went into overdrive in September. A strong earnings report and its addition to the S\u0026P 500 that month stoked a ton of buying for the stock. The market has continued to push the stock higher, bringing the company's market cap above $187 billion, as of this writing. Palantir's financial results have been spectacular. But many analysts think the stock has gotten ahead of itself. Just three out of 22 Wall Street analysts covering the stock give it an overweight or buy rating. Moreover, none of them have a 12-month price target higher than its current stock price. Indeed, Palantir's stock valuation makes it tough to buy now. But investors looking to add some AI stocks to their portfolio have plenty of other options. And two other companies look far more attractive than the richly valued Palantir. In fact, I predict both will be worth more than Palantir by the end of 2025, as a result of strong relative price performance to 2024's big winner. Image source: Getty Images. There are two big shifts going on that increase the demand for Palo Alto Networks' (NASDAQ: PANW) cybersecurity services. More and more enterprises are shifting from on-premise storage and compute for their data and software needs to cloud computing. As they migrate to the cloud or adopt a hybrid approach, they increase the number of potential attack points for cyber criminals. Additionally, most workplaces have adopted a hybrid approach to working in the office versus working from home. Again, this opens more potential security vulnerabilities. Palo Alto offers security solutions across clients' networks (firewalls) in both hardware and software formats. It also offers solutions for the cloud and endpoint security, ensuring only authorized devices gain access to sensitive network data. Many cybersecurity providers rely on machine learning artificial intelligence to help detect cybersecurity threats early and close vulnerabilities. One of the biggest challenges for building an effective system based on machine learning is accessing valuable data. As a leader in the space, Palo Alto has a considerable data advantage over the competition. As such, its AI efforts pay off handsomely, as they work better than competitors. What's more, Palo Alto's capabilities make it more attractive to new customers, creating a virtuous cycle, whereby it gains access to more valuable data than its competitors.",
