So it’s important to be sure you’re getting the best rate possible when shopping around for a savings account. The following is a breakdown of savings interest rates today and where to find the best offers. The national average savings account rate stands at 0.42%, according to the FDIC. This might not seem like much, but consider that three years ago, it was just 0.06%. Although the national average savings interest rate is fairly low compared to other types of accounts (such as CDs) and investments, the best savings rates on the market today are much higher. In fact, some of the top accounts are currently offering 4% APY and higher. Today, the highest savings account rate available from our partners today is 4.75% APY. This rate is offered by Openbank and there is a $500 minimum opening deposit required. Here is a look at some of the best savings rates available today from our verified partners: Related: 10 best high-yield savings accounts today\u003e\u003e The amount of interest you can earn from a savings account depends on the annual percentage rate (APY). This is a measure of your total earnings after one year when considering the base interest rate and how often interest compounds (savings account interest typically compounds daily). Say you put $1,000 in a savings account at the average interest rate of 0.42% with daily compounding. At the end of one year, your balance would grow to $1,004.21 — your initial $1,000 deposit, plus just $4.21 in interest. Now let’s say you choose a high-yield savings account that offers 4% APY instead. In this case, your balance would grow to $1,040.81 over the same period, which includes $40.81 in interest. The more you deposit in a savings account, the more you stand to earn. If we took our same example of a high-yield savings account at 4% APY, but deposit $10,000, your total balance after one year would be $10,408.08, meaning you’d earn $408.08 in interest. ​​ Read more: What is a good savings account rate? 8 smart money moves to make with $1,000 in savings Why now is a good time to open a savings account How do banks set their savings account interest rates?",
