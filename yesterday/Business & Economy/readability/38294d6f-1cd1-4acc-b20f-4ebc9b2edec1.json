  "text": "Spanish reinsurer MAPFRE RE has reorganised its business structure with the aim of advancing its “strategic objectives”. The changes, effective from 1 March, will focus on the development of the life business, along with a “sharper strategic, commercial and technical focus, and enhanced relationship with clients and brokers”. The new structure is also expected to support an “agile response” to evolving client and market needs. MAPFRE RE has appointed Javier San Basilio as general manager. In his new role, Basilio will coordinate the regional divisions and take responsibility for developing relationships with large clients and brokers. The reinsurer’s non-group business is now structured into non-life underwriting and life business. As assistant general managers, Carmen Bueso will lead the non-life underwriting unit, while Maite González will head the life business, which includes life, health and accident functions. Ricardo Pérez has been appointed as the manager for the Iberia and Latin America region and will become a member of MAPFRE RE’s management committee. The company operates across four regional divisions: Iberia/Latam, overseen by Pérez; APAC, led by Javier Sánchez Cea; EMEA, headed by Mark Meyerhoff; and North America, managed by Carlos Sanzo. Fernando Utrilla will continue to manage the business coming from the MAPFRE Group. Additionally, a strategy, communication, sustainability and innovation division has been established to provide an “integrated vision” of these aspects, under the leadership of Juan Satrústegui. MAPFRE RE CEO Miguel Rosa said: “These changes will enable us to move forward with greater agility and ambition in the MAPFRE RE strategy as we take on even greater challenges in the coming years. We will continue boosting the non-life business and drive the development of our life business, where we have a long way to go.” In December 2024, MAPFRE RE sponsored its first catastrophe bond for $125m (€120.98m), designed to protect against catastrophic events such as tropical storms and hurricanes in the US. \"MAPFRE RE revamps business structure to drive strategic goals \" was originally created and published by Life Insurance International, a GlobalData owned brand.
