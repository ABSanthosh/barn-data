  "text": "Technical charts indicate the formation of a bearish trend. If the Nifty breaches the 23,000 mark, it could trigger selling pressure, dragging the index down to the 22,800–22,500 range and if it crosses and sustains above 23,300, the index may advance towards the 23,500–23,700 levels, according to analysts. Stocks such as Wipro, HCL Technologies, Britannia, Bajaj Finance, Eicher Motors, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, Laurus Labs, Indian Hotels, Page Industries, and LIC Housing Finance are expected to exhibit bullish trends in the days ahead. RAJESH PALVIYA HEAD TECHNICAL DERIVATIVES, AXIS SECURITIES Where is Nifty headed this week? On the weekly chart, the index has formed a small bearish candle with shadows on both sides, situated near the critical support level of 23,000. This pattern indicates indecisiveness among market participants, with the 23,000 level serving as a key inflexion point. A sustained hold above this support could signal a potential reversal, while a decisive breach below it may intensify downward momentum. If the index breaks below 23,000, it could trigger selling pressure, pulling the index down to the 22,800–22,500 levels. Conversely, if the index successfully crosses and holds above 23,300, it is likely to attract buying interest and move towards the 23,500–23,700 levels. What should investors do? Furthermore, the weekly strength indicator, RSI, is trending downward and remains below its reference line, indicating a negative bias. The market is currently in an oversold condition, with only the IT sector and select FMCG stocks demonstrating strength amid intense selling pressure from foreign institutional investors (FIIs), which is preventing the Nifty from sustaining higher levels. Investors may want to focus on stocks like Wipro, HCL Technologies, Britannia, Tata Consumer Products, and Laurus Labs, as these are expected to show bullish behaviour in the coming days.AJIT MISHRA SVP-RESEARCH, RELIGARE BROKING Where is Nifty headed this week?The Nifty continued its consolidation for the second consecutive week, declining by nearly half a per cent amid mixed signals. Looking ahead, the index remains vulnerable to further downside, with crucial support in the 22,700–22,900 range. On the upside, any recovery is expected to face stiff resistance around the 23,450–23,650 zone, corresponding to the 20-day and 200-day exponential moving averages (DEMA). What should investors do? A noteworthy concern is the growing disconnect between the benchmark indices and the broader market. While selective buying in heavyweight stocks has limited the overall decline, broader market stocks continue to face sharp corrections, significantly impacting portfolio values. However, certain segments are showing resilience amid the correction. Participants are encouraged to focus on a stock-specific strategy and consider hedged positions, given the upcoming events and elevated uncertainty. Stocks that have formed bullish trends include Bajaj Finance, Eicher Motors, Infosys, Mphasis, Marico, Tata Consumer, and Tech Mahindra while those that have formed bearish trends include Glenmark, HPCL, Indiamart, Jindal Steel, Polycabs, REC and, Tata Motors.TANMAY SHAH HEAD OF RESEARCH, SIHL Where is the Nifty headed this week? The Indian equity markets are currently under pressure due to persistent FII outflows of approximately Rs 69,000 crore in January so far, compounded by global challenges like Trump’s inaugural policies, geopolitical tensions, and subdued Q3 earnings. This has led the markets to trade within a downward zone, with Nifty resting on a strong support level of 22,820. As we approach key events like the Union Budget and MPC meeting, a breakout above 23,350 could trigger an upward rally towards 23,850, while a breach of the support level might extend the weakness. What should investors do? With the upcoming Budget announcement in focus, investors should remain cautious as a populist budget could strain the fiscal deficit, weaken the rupee, and hinder economic growth by limiting the scope for rate cuts. However, government spending will be closely monitored to assess whether it maintains a multiplier effect, which could be positive and influence various sectors. In light of potential volatility, investors are advised to adopt a defensive approach, focusing on sectors like healthcare, power, and consumer discretionary to shield themselves from significant market fluctuations. Among largecaps NTPC, Sun Pharma, Eicher Motors and Bajaj Finance are of interest. In the mid-cap space, Indian Hotel, Page Industries and LIC Housing Finance appear promising. In the small-cap segment, Indian Energy Exchange and Welspun Living are favoured.",
