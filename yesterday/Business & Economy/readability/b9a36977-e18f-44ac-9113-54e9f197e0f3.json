Zuckerberg told employees 2025 will \"be an intense year.\"The company specified that it is \"exiting approximately 5% of our lowest performers\" in a separate message posted by a company director. Meta has more than 72,000 employees, according to its most recent quarterly report.Meta said employees affected by the layoffs will be notified by Feb. 10 and receive severance in line with what the company has provided previously. The cuts represent Meta's largest layoffs since it eliminated 21,000 jobs, or nearly a quarter of its workforce, in 2022 and 2023.Bloomberg was first to report the cuts, citing an internal memo.The move follows several major operational changes within Meta aimed at building closer ties with President-elect Donald Trump.Read more CNBC tech newsMicrosoft pauses hiring in U.S. consulting unit as part of cost-cutting plan: Read memoCrypto ETFs have big innovation opportunity in 2025, but demand may be weakElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos will attend Trump inaugurationOpenAI adds BlackRock exec Adebayo Ogunlesi to board of directorsLast week, Zuckerberg announced Meta would end its third-party fact-checking program in favor of a \"Community Notes\" model used on Elon Musk's platform X, where individual users provide more context to posts.\"The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech, so we're going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our polices and restoring free expression on our platforms,\" Zuckerberg said in a video announcement.Below is Zuckeberg's internal memo, which CNBC obtained.Meta is working on building some of the most important technologies of the world.

We typically manage out people who aren't meeting expectations over the course of a year, but now we're going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle, with the intention of back filling these roles in 2025. We won't manage out everyone who didn't meet expectations for the last period if we're optimistic about their future performance, and for those we do let go, we'll provide generous severance in line with what we provided with previous cuts. We'll follow up with more guidance for managers ahead of calibrations.
