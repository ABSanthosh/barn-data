Investors had plenty of reason to smile during Trump's first term in the Oval Office. From his inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017 until President Joe Biden took office on Jan. 20, 2021, Trump oversaw respective returns in the mature stock-driven Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), benchmark S\u0026P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and innovation-fueled Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) of 57%, 70%, and 142%. Despite beating the odds and becoming only the second president to serve in nonconsecutive terms (Grover Cleveland being the other), President-Elect Donald Trump is set to make dubious stock market history when he takes office for his second term. Despite all three major stock indexes soaring after Election Day, President-Elect Trump will be entering the Oval Office under extremely challenging circumstances. More specifically, no incoming president has ever inherited a stock market as pricey as the one we're looking at today. Admittedly, value is in the eye of the beholder, and what one investor finds attractive from a valuation standpoint may be the opposite for someone else. But according to one historically flawless valuation tool, there have only been a select few times since the early 1870s where the stock market has been this pricey. Most investors are likely familiar with the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which divides a company's share price into its trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS). The traditional P/E ratio can be a fine tool for quickly assessing relative value for mature stocks, but it's often lacking in the sense that it fails to factor in future growth potential and struggles during shock events.",
