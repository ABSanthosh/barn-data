Both of these investment options have the potential to yield a guaranteed income without risking your initial investment if you keep them invested for a set time or “maturity” period. However, just because an investment is stable, that doesn’t actually mean it’s without risk. Fidelity broke down the difference between the two investment options, to determine which one is truly the safest investment. Here are the key factors you need to consider. While earnings on any kind of investment are great, they feel a bit less so when you have to pay taxes on those earnings. Here’s an area where Treasurys have a benefit over CDs. While the interest from any earnings on CDs are taxable, Treasurys are exempt from state income tax. So, investing in a Treasury can actually play into a tax protective strategy if you live in a high-tax state, particularly if you are in a high tax-bracket. From a tax perspective, if deciding between a Treasury and a CD yielding about the same APY, it probably makes more sense to go with the Treasury.

Both Treasurys and CDs share the same problem of locking in your funds until a “maturity” date, which can be anywhere from a few months to a couple of years, on average. You can potentially sell both products before their maturity dates and receive a lower amount than what you’d get if you remained invested, but Treasurys have a more liquid market, according to Fidelity, making them easier to sell before their time if you need the funds faster. Once again, this gives the Treasury a slight edge over a CD. People often choose both CDs and Treasurys because of their low risks, so long as you stick with the maturity period. They both come with a fair amount of security in how they’re backed. CDs are issued by banks and insured by the federal government’s FDIC insurance (up to $250,000 per bank, per person). Plus, you can purchase them from different banks to increase the maximum protection — meaning if you bought one for $250,000 from Bank A and another $250,000 from Bank B, you’d be covered for $500,000.",
