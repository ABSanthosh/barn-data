According to CNN, in late 2024, then-President-elect Donald Trump’s allies were talking about potentially dismantling the FDIC and putting the U.S. Treasury in charge of deposit insurance.

Try This: 8 Common Mistakes Retirees Make With Their Social Security Checks NPR reported that Project 2025 called for merging the FDIC and other banking regulators, and in the wake of Trump’s widespread federal employee firings, about 170 probationary FDIC workers were fired in late February. The FDIC rescinded more than 200 job offers to new examiners, and about 500 had accepted the Trump administration’s deferred resignation letter. All of these shifts signal that other changes might be in store for the FDIC, prompting many Americans to feel unsettled about the safety of their bank accounts. If additional changes occur, knowing which actions to take can help you protect your money. Cory Frank, certified financial advisor (CFA), co-Founder and CEO of Robora Financial, explained that the FDIC insures deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, per account category, per bank at member banks. That insurance helps protect customers in case of a bank failure, building public confidence in the banking system and reducing the chance of a bank run. “The FDIC oversees and examines financial institutions for safety, soundness and compliance with consumer protection laws,” said Frank. It steps in to manage the closure of failed banks, pay insured depositors and liquidate assets, minimizing disruption and cost to the financial system. Additionally, the FDIC enforces consumer protection laws and monitors economic and financial risks that could threaten the banking system. “If any of these functions were completely eliminated, there could be a gap remaining in the financial system that could be harmful to bank customers as well as the financial system as a whole,” explained Frank. “The most obvious negative impact would be if bank deposit insurance were completely eliminated. In this scenario, approximately $10.7 trillion in currently insured bank deposits would become uninsured, significantly increasing risks for both customers and banks.” However, that doesn’t mean that the FDIC will necessarily be eliminated or completely changed. According to Frank, dramatically changing the FDIC would be an uphill legal battle. The insurance coverage the FDIC provides could also potentially be moved to the Treasury while still functioning properly, he added.",
