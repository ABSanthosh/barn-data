  "text": "SynopsisFrom January to October, overseas investors pulled ₹63,871 crore out of the shares in the sector out of which ₹32,231 crore was due to the consistent selling in October and the first-half of November.AgenciesThe realty sector witnessed inflows worth ₹1,367 crore after investors bought shares worth ₹694 crore in the first-half of the month.Mumbai: Financial Services led by HDFC Bank, information technology and consumer goods garnered a sizeable chunk of the foreign investors' flows in the second-half of November. These investors put ₹17,877 crore across 13 sectors between November 16 and 30. Financial services received the highest inflows of ₹9,597 crore after selling to the tune of ₹7,092 crore in the first-half of the month, thanks to passive fund flows into HDFC Bank in this period.\"The MSCI rebalancing led to foreign inflows of more than $2 billion into HDFC Bank,\" said Nikhil Ranka, CIO equity alternatives, Nuvama Asset Management. \"However, on an ex-HDFC bank basis, the banking sector has seen net FII outflows.\" AgenciesFrom January to October, overseas investors pulled ₹63,871 crore out of the shares in the sector out of which ₹32,231 crore was due to the consistent selling in October and the first-half of November.The Bank Nifty index gained 2.7% last month, against an up-move of 2% in the benchmark Nifty index in the same period.Foreign investors infused funds over ₹2,000 crore in information technology (IT) and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) in the second-half of November. They had bought shares worth ₹3,087 crore in the IT sector and sold shares worth ₹3,589 crore in the latter in the first 15 days of November.Ranka said that rupee depreciation is a margin tailwind for information technology companies. Since over 60% of their revenue comes from the US, the outlook for IT companies has become strong after Trump's victory.The realty sector witnessed inflows worth ₹1,367 crore after investors bought shares worth ₹694 crore in the first-half of the month.Overseas investors sold shares worth Rs 17,068 crore in the secondhalf of November across 10 sectors. Oil \u0026 gas sector continued to bear the brunt of foreign selling, as investors dumped shares worth Rs 6,132 crore in the sector. Global investors have sold shares worth Rs 32,168 crore in the sector so far this year. Bhat said that during wars and episodes of heightened geopolitical tension, there is a spike in the volatility in crude oil prices, and this seems to have led to foreign investors paring their exposure to the sector. The unabated selling persisted in the automobile counters, with investors withdrawing Rs 3,053 crore from the sector in the last 15 days of November. “The increased discounts in the auto sector to clear up channel inventory has led to some margin pressure in auto companies,” said Ranka. Telecommunication and services sector witnessed foreign selling worth over Rs 2,500 crore each while overseas investors dumped shares worth Rs 1,913 crore in the construction materials sector in the same period. Bhat said that the services sector is the most significant segment of the Indian economy and the drop in GDP growth in the last quarter could have led to outflows. “After the heavy foreign outflows, the scope for any further major outflows is not much,” said Bhat. “If Trump imposes much higher tariffs on China than on India, then fresh foreign inflows are likely.” At home, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 8,539.91 crore on Thursday. Their domestic counterparts bought shares worth Rs 2,303.64 crore. Ranka said that the foreign holding in the NSE 500 companies has come down to a decade low of 16% and further selling is expected to be minor. “Any incremental foreign selling is expected to subside as we have witnessed the bulk of the selloff in October and November and fresh allocations to emerging markets are expected in January,” said Ranka.
