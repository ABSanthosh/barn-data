  "text": "In This Article: We recently published a list of the 13 Best Technology Stocks to Buy for Long-Term Investment. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Applovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP)  stands against other tech stocks to buy for long-term investment. On May 12, Jeff Kilburg of KKM Financial and Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities appeared together on CNBC to discuss AI, cybersecurity, and mega-cap tech, especially as tech stocks soar as the US-China tariff deal boosts market confidence. Jeff Kilburg first identified the tech software sector as the primary beneficiary of the recent market pause amid optimism and gains, and highlighted that markets are broadly positive. He noted that many investors underestimated how quickly a China trade deal would materialize and contrasted it with the UK deal, which was expected to be a slower, tentative template. Kilburg suggests that faster deal-making could continue and benefit several software companies, which have been overlooked due to the focus on the MAG7. Dan Ives concurred with Kilburg’s view but singled out NVIDIA as the biggest near-to-medium-term beneficiary of the pause, especially given its prior exposure to China tariffs. He referenced the ongoing AI revolution and the surge in AI-related stocks and described the current environment as a dream scenario for tech investors. Ives anticipates new highs for tech and the broader market. He also described a ‘golden age’ for cybersecurity stocks, which are acting as secondary beneficiaries of AI growth. On a question about the impact of the admin’s focus on reducing federal spending and debt, particularly on companies that derive substantial revenue from government contracts, Kilburg responded that this fiscal discipline is actually positive for software companies as it may drive more spending toward efficient software solutions. Kilburg also addressed the sectors to avoid or be cautious about amid the current market environment. He suggests trimming utilities, which have been a safe haven but may now be less attractive. He points out that the VIX volatility index dropping below 20, which is a big change from over 60 in April, indicates reduced market fear and increased investor confidence. This suggests a market environment favoring higher-beta and growth-oriented investments rather than defensive plays. We first sifted through stock screeners, ETFs, and financial media reports to compile a list of the top tech stocks that have grown over 15% in the past 3 years. We then selected the 13 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024.",
