Despite weak FMCG ad spends, strong sports and subscription income lifted earnings.ETMarkets.comJioStar's Q1 profit rose to ₹581 crore, led by record IPL revenues, digital growth, and strong subscription deals, despite sluggish TV ad environment.JioStar, the joint venture between Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) and Walt Disney, reported a net profit of ₹581 crore for the quarter ended June, according to RIL’s quarterly financial disclosure.The company recorded an EBITDA of ₹1,017 crore and operating revenue of ₹9,601 crore, driven by the strong performance of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025. This comes despite ongoing challenges in the entertainment segment due to reduced FMCG advertising spends.RIL said the IPL delivered its highest-ever revenue across TV and digital this year. JioStar holds both TV and digital rights for the IPL in the Indian market.While the TV entertainment segment continued to face pressure, the impact was offset by strong sports and subscription revenues.

The IPL 2025 final set a new digital benchmark, becoming the most-watched T20 match ever online with 237 million viewers and a peak concurrency of 55.2 million, surpassing the previous high of 35.9 million. The final also drew 189 million viewers on TV, making it the most-watched IPL match in broadcast history.Beyond the IPL, JioStar’s sports portfolio featured marquee events such as the ICC World Test Championship (WTC) Final. The network also secured exclusive digital streaming rights for India’s five-Test series against England from Sony Pictures Networks India, further strengthening its sports lineup.JioHotstar recorded its highest-ever monthly entertainment watch time in June 2025. The latest season of Criminal Justice delivered the strongest opening for any OTT original this year, according to Ormax Media, while Kesari 2 emerged as the most-watched film across all languages on the platform.International content continued to gain traction. Captain America: Brave New World debuted as the second most-watched film of the quarter, while Mufasa: The Lion King became the most-watched international film ever on JioHotstar.Star Plus retained its leadership in the Hindi GEC segment, with six of the top ten shows during the quarter.Regional general entertainment channels also performed strongly.
