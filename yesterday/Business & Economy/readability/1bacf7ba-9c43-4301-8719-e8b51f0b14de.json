Santiago | Getty ImagesAmazon has dethroned Walmart in quarterly revenue for the first time ever.Amazon said earlier this month that it brought in $187.8 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter. That beat Walmart's sales for the period, which came in at $180.5 billion, the company reported on Thursday.Since 2012, Walmart has held the distinction of being the top revenue generator each quarter, a title it gained after overtaking oil giant Exxon Mobil.Walmart still leads the way in annual sales, though Amazon is gaining ground. Walmart is projected to reel in $708.7 billion in the fiscal year ahead while Amazon's full-year revenue for 2025 is expected to reach $700.8 billion, according to FactSet.Amazon's core retail unit remains its biggest revenue generator, but its top line is also being fueled by its massive cloud computing, advertising and seller services businesses. Third-party seller services, which includes commissions and fees collected by Amazon on fulfillment and shipping, advertising and customer support, accounted for 24.5% of the company's total sales last year. Amazon Web Services was responsible for nearly 17%.Walmart has looked to its chief rival for ways to sustain sales growth. The company operates a third-party marketplace and offers sellers fulfillment services, although both businesses are a fraction of the size of Amazon's. Walmart has also launched an advertising business and a loyalty program for shoppers, called Walmart+, that competes with Amazon Prime.— CNBC's Robert Hum contributed to this report.Read more CNBC tech newsAI startup Baseten raises $75 million following DeepSeek's emergenceMicrosoft reveals its first quantum computing chip, the Majorana 1Tesla's law firm drafts Delaware bill that could salvage Musk pay packageIntel pops 16% for best day since March 2020 on potential breakup",
