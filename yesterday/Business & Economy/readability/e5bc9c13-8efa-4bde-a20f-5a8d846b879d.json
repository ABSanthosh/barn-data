  "text": "Retail companies have been through the gauntlet. The pandemic, rising inflation, and the shift of consumer spending to travel and other services have pressured the stock performance of many retail companies. The SPDR S\u0026P Retail ETF has declined 9.6% over the past three years, underperforming the S\u0026P 500's 26% return. However, when an industry has underperformed to this extent, lower valuations can set the stage for better returns. Slowing sales at Dollar General (NYSE: DG) has sent its stock down, but after falling 71% from its 2022 highs, it might be one of the most undervalued retail stocks right now. The company has continued to pay quarterly dividends, which has brought its yield up to an all-time high of 3.2% as of January 7. This is nearly triple the S\u0026P 500 average yield of 1.2%. Wall Street analysts are concerned about near-term consumer spending trends and competition with big-box retailers. However, Dollar General is still reporting positive same-store sales, and its Back to Basics strategy could lead to better earnings growth. The stock could be a bargain as management executes its turnaround plan in the new year. It's understandable why the stock fell and is currently trading at a low price-to-earnings multiple of 12.5. The company's same-store sales, which measures growth at existing stores open over a year, grew just 1.3% in Q3 over the year-ago quarter. Total net sales grew 5% year over year, which is below Dollar General's 10-year average quarterly sales growth of 8%. Wall Street is quick to draw comparisons to Walmart, which has reported stronger same-store sales. Walmart's U.S. same-store sales were up 5.3% year over year last quarter. It was particularly bad news for Dollar General that Walmart cited strength in general merchandise. Dollar General is also struggling with higher costs, as earnings per share fell 29% year over year. However, these numbers are reflected in the stock's valuation. The most important question is, where does Dollar General go from here? Is this the best it can do, or are there areas of the business that management can improve to strengthen earnings and boost sales growth? Dollar General is currently executing its Back to Basics plan, and some of these initiatives involve bringing automation to fulfillment centers, which should save the company money and improve margins. It is making stores cleaner and more shopper-friendly. One of the biggest changes is improving the supply chain to increase in-stock items on store shelves. CEO Todd Vasos gave investors an update on how these initiatives are working on the Q3 earnings call.",
