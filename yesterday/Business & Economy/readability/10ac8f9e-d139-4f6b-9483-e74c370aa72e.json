However, defense stocks in the US have struggled this year due to concerns about government budget cuts. President Trump has hinted at significantly reducing future military spending if things settle down with China and Russia. The creation of DOGE has also reshaped investors’ views of the industry. Despite a shaky start to 2025, analysts at UBS are optimistic about the sector as they believe the downside is shrinking. Here is what the firm recently stated: “Consensus estimates have moved higher since the election despite the 40% sell-off. The downside potential seems increasingly smaller. We believe that the current environment is markedly different from Sequestration and do not believe a similar outcome is likely.” Citi analyst Jason Gursky, in a note to clients on March 5, also urged investors about this being the right time to buy American defense stocks. While the analyst acknowledged that the world may be moving toward a multi-polar order, he argued that it was not any less dangerous to decrease the need to acquire tools of deterrence. Gursky also stated that as long as the global threat environment remains and the United States maintains its leadership role, regardless of whether it is as a sole superpower or as a power in a multipolar world order, defense spending is expected to remain robust, which would benefit stocks in the sector. With that said, let’s now head over to the list of defense stocks that are declining this week. Please note that the stocks listed are based on one week’s performance. Our analysis does not reflect the prospects of the companies. Their share prices could go high or low in the future, depending on external market conditions, industry-specific challenges, and the company’s capabilities.
