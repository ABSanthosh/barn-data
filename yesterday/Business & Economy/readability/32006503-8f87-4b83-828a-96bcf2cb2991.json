The outage was resolved on Monday, and was not related to a cyberattack or other security incident.CHS is based in Tennessee and includes 72 hospitals in 14 states, according to the medical system's website.\"Despite this being a major outage, our hospitals were able to maintain services with no material impact,\" the spokesperson said. \"We are proud of our clinical and support teams who worked through the multi-day outage with professionalism and a commitment to delivering high-quality, safe care for patients.\" Stock Chart IconStock chart iconOracle stock this yearOracle didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.An EHR is a digital version of a patient's medical history that's updated by doctors and nurses. It's crucial software within the U.S. health-care system, and outages can cause serious disruptions to patient care. Oracle acquired EHR vendor Cerner in 2022 for $28.3 billion, becoming the second-biggest player in the market, behind Epic Systems.Now that Oracle's systems are back online, CHS said that the impacted hospitals are working to \"re-establish full functionality and return to normal operations and procedures.\"Oracle's CHS error comes weeks after the company's federal electronic health record experienced a nationwide outage. Oracle has struggled with a thorny, years-long EHR rollout with the Department of Veterans Affairs, marred by patient safety concerns. The agency launched a strategic review of Cerner in 2021, before Oracle's acquisition, and it temporarily paused deployment of the software in 2023.WATCH: Interview with Oracle CEO Safra Catz",
