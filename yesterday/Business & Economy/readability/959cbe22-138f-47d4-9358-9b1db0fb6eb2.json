  "text": "Chris Ratcliffe / Bloomberg via Getty Images Oil prices rose to a five-month high on Monday, weighing on the stocks of airlines, cruise operators, and other companies whose finances are directly affected by the price of fuel. Oil prices jumped more than 3% at the end of last week after the Treasury Department announced sweeping sanctions against the Russian oil industry, raising concerns about possible disruptions to global supply. Brent crude, the global benchmark, rose more than 1% to about $81 a barrel, its highest level since August. West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark, traded at $78.70 a barrel on Monday afternoon, a nearly 3% increase from Friday. Airlines, for which fuel is a large expense, were feeling the pressure on Monday. Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) fell over 2%. American Airlines (AAL) slumped more than 4%. Cruise operators like Carnival (CCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) were also lower, down about 1.6% and 0.6%, respectively. On the flip side, oil and natural gas producers were among the S\u0026P 500's best performers on Monday. Shares of Baker Hughes (BKR) were up nearly 4% and ExxonMobil (XOM) advanced close to 3%. Travel stocks finished the year strong as oil prices trended lower and consumers showed few signs that higher prices have dented robust post-pandemic travel demand. United Airlines was one of the S\u0026P 500’s best-performing stocks in 2024. Its shares have more than doubled in value in the past year. Delta has gained about 69% over the same period. Royal Caribbean (RCL) stock was little changed Monday but has risen more than 87% in the last 12 months. Read the original article on Investopedia",
