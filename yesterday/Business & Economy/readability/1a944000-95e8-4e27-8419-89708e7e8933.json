  "text": "In This Article: U.S. Big Oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron said May 2 they will steadfastly maintain their spending and stock buyback plans in the face of tariff uncertainty and lower oil prices—despite reporting declining quarterly earnings year over year. The straighter paths of Exxon and Chevron, which have maintained their emphasis on fossil fuels more consistently, differ from those of their European counterparts, Shell and BP, which are now retrenching back to oil and gas after investing more heartily in renewable energy in recent years. However, Shell announced May 2 it still plans $3.5 billion in second-quarter buybacks, while BP, which is under greater financial distress, is scaling back buybacks this year. Even though tariffs are expected to add to certain costs and OPEC is increasing its production volumes—further weighing on oil prices—Exxon Mobil chairman and CEO Darren Woods said the Western Hemisphere’s largest energy company is maintaining its capital spending program and still plans to start up several projects this year, including off the shores of booming Guyana. “We’re ready for this,” Woods said on the earnings call, noting that Exxon is “pretty well shielded” from tariffs for projects that are already under construction. “We know that shorter-term investors want lower capex and higher cash distributions. I suspect with today’s level of market uncertainty, the call for this will be even stronger. That’s shortsighted. We play the long game,” Woods argued. “We are rewarding investors today with investments made in the past when we faced similar circumstances and a lot of criticism for staying the course. The passage of time demonstrated the value in this approach.” One particularly timely project Exxon Mobil just brought online this spring is its $10 billion China chemical complex. “We will competitively supply high-value chemical products for the China market, protected from tariffs with attractive long-term growth.” However, Woods did make it clear that about one-third of Exxon’s oil and gas production is short-cycle, especially in the onshore U.S., where it can ramp down more quickly if needed later this year. Additional projects that are not yet green-lit could always be delayed if needed, he said. Last year Exxon dramatically increased its exposure to the onshore U.S., in particular the massive Permian Basin, with the $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources. “I don’t think we have finished mining the value that we see in this combination,” Woods said. “It’s full steam ahead. Everything is looking very good, and we’re exceeding our own expectations.”",
