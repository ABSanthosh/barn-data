  "text": "Image by Funtap via Shutterstock Quantum computing stocks are heating up again, offering investors a front-row seat to what could be the next massive tech revolution. Even Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang, once skeptical about near-term adoption, recently said quantum computing was at an “inflection point,” signaling a dramatic shift from his earlier stance that it was “decades away.” Companies in this space are finally beginning to move from the research lab to real-world commercialization. Quantum Computing (QUBT) just hit a major milestone in that journey. The company announced the successful shipment of its first commercial entangled photon source to a South Korean research institution. This cutting-edge product is a foundational piece of QUBT’s quantum cybersecurity platform, which won a 2024 Edison Award. The shipment not only showcases the company’s ability to execute globally, but also underscores growing demand for integrated quantum solutions.

With real momentum behind it and a clear roadmap ahead, QUBT could be a high-risk, high-reward play for investors looking to capitalize on the coming wave of quantum adoption. Based in Hoboken, New Jersey, Quantum Computing is an integrated photonics company that focuses on the development of quantum machines for both commercial and government markets in the United States. The company specializes in thin-film lithium niobate chips. These chips are central to QUBT’s mission of building quantum machines that operate at room temperature and require low power. Valued at $2.7 billion by market cap, QUBT shares have exploded over the past year, soaring more than 3,000%. However, the stock has cooled in 2025, rising just 17.4% year-to-date amid growing skepticism over the commercialization timeline for quantum technology. Following last year’s sharp rally, QUBT's valuation has reached nosebleed territory, with a staggering price-sales ratio of 7,475x, far above the sector median. This suggests the stock is extremely overvalued compared to its industry peers. www.barchart.com On May 16, Shares of QUBT popped nearly 40% in a single trading session after Quantum Computing reported Q1 results that illustrate both nascent revenue traction and the substantial investments required to advance its quantum photonics roadmap.",
