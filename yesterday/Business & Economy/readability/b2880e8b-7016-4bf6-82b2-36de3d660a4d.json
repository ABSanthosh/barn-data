  "text": "Technical indicators point to continued near-term weakness in the market, with Nifty likely to test the 22,670 support zone before attempting a counter-trend rally. Recent pullbacks have failed to sustain, hence a close above the 20-DMA of 23,255 is a must for a sustainable rally toward 24,200, according to technical analysts. Stocks to consider for long positions include Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, ICICI Bank, M\u0026M, UltraTech Cement, United Breweries, and Divi’s Lab.JATIN GEDIA TECHNICAL RESEARCH ANALYST, MIRAE ASSET SHAREKHANWhere is the Nifty headed? As per the Elliott wave principle, this correction is a wave four correction which typically retraces 38.2% of the previous wave and hence we expect this ongoing correction phase to terminate around the 22,670 – 22,460 zone which coincides with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the rise from 16,828 to 26,277 and the 20-month moving average. Positive divergence is visible on daily momentum indicators, suggesting exhaustion of selling pressure. The pullbacks are unable to sustain and hence a close above the 20-day moving average (23,255) shall be the minimum requirement for a meaningful and sustainable counter-trend rally towards 24,200 – 24,500. We expect Nifty to test the support zone of 22,670 –22,460, and start a counter-trend rally this week. What should investors do? Investors should utilise this fall to accumulate quality large-cap stocks that have relatively outperformed during this corrective phase. A simple relative strength scan provides a handful of stocks among the large caps namely Bajaj Finance, Bajaj FinServ, ICICI Bank, M\u0026M, UltraTech Cement, and Wipro which can be considered as they have been resilient, suggesting inherent strength. Mid- and micro-cap stocks should be avoided, and counter-trend rallies should be used as an exit opportunity rather than adding or averaging. AgenciesSACCHITANAND UTTEKAR VP- TECHNICAL \u0026 DERIVATIVES, TRADEBULLS SECURITIESWhere is the Nifty headed? Trend strength indicators remain negative — the daily RSI (relative strength index) is below 50, signaling weak momentum, while the daily average directional index (ADX), after surpassing 25, is rising, warning against support-based buying. Nifty must breach 23,300-23,410 to regain bullish momentum. A key concern is that the weekly ADX is indicating continued downside risk. Expect range-bound movement with a negative bias between 23,400 and 22,400 for the rest of the series. A sell-on-rise strategy remains favourable, with options data showing fi rm resistance at 23,300 (earlier 23,500) and key support at 22,500 and 22,400. Long positions should only be considered if Nifty breaks 23,560; otherwise, weakness may deepen further. What should investors do? Traders are advised to avoid initiating leveraged long positions. Until the index decisively trends above 23,560, a long-short strategy remains prudent. Investors can leverage this volatilitydriven phase to accumulate quality stocks at optimised entry levels, particularly in sectors with strong tailwinds. Close monitoring of earnings outcomes is essential. The top stocks to watch are UltraTech Cement, ICICI Bank, Kotak Bank, United Breweries, and Divi’s LabPRITESH MEHTA EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT – RESEARCH, YES SECURITIESWhere is the Nifty headed? Nifty is just holding onto the midpoint of the current threedigit Gann channel, placed near multiple lows around the 22,800 zone, yet it is lacking the follow-through. However, a potential reversal move could come into play — a break below the 22,800 zone followed by a smart recovery. We don’t expect the price to sustain at lower levels for long. With select bank and fi nancial names showing relative strength, a pullback rally will likely play out up to the 23,200 zone. What should investors do? With broader markets, like midcaps and small-caps 100 indices, showing relative and absolute weakness, sticking with large-cap names would be an ideal approach. Our customised defense index is deteriorating, and the Nifty Realty index has formed a bearish anchor column, suggesting continuation of weakness in both. Meanwhile, the ratio of the Nifty Financial Services vs Nifty is attempting to surpass the Dec peak, a break above would result in a continuation of fi nancials’ outperformance. We expect a rally of 8-10% in Bajaj Finserv and Chola Finance in the medium term.",
