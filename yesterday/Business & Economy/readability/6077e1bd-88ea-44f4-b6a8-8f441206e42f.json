Remove AdsIn comparison, the benchmark Nifty is 12% below its peak level on September 27, while the Nifty Smallcap 100 and Nifty Midcap 100 indices are trading 14% below their highs. Agencies When an index declines over 20% from a 52-week, it is considered to be in a bearish phase.The Nifty Next 50 represents 50 companies from the Nifty 100, excluding those in the Nifty 50. Over the six months ending September 2024, its constituents accounted for about 15% of the NSE's total traded value.Seven stocks from the index, including four Adani Group stocks, IRFC, BHEL, and Union Bank, have plunged 40-58% from their yearly highs. Another 17 stocks, such as NHPC, Indian Oil, DMart, and JSW Energy, have declined 30-40% in the same period.Tired of too many ads? Remove Ads\"A drop of 10-20% is considered a bull market correction, while a fall exceeding 20% signals entry into a bear market,\" said Arpan Shah, technical analyst at Monarch Networth Capital. \"Although the index has formed a lower-top, lower-bottom pattern on the weekly chart, indicating continued downside, the RSI (relative strength index) is oversold on both daily and weekly charts, suggesting potential for a short-term pullback,\" Shah added.Sectorally, indices like Nifty Media, Energy, PSU Bank, Oil \u0026 Gas, Metal, and Realty have already declined over 20% from their 52-week highs, confirming their bear market status.According to Shah, the Nifty Next 50 has major support at 60,663, which was hit on the general election results day on June 4, 2024. \"If this level holds, traders can expect a temporary pullback toward 65,000,\" he said. The index closed at 61,481 on Monday.",
