This might trigger a sector-wide re-rating for the auto industry, according to analysts.The Rs 27,870 crore IPO from Hyundai is the first from the major auto player in India in over two decades and thereby drawing a lot of eyeballs from foreign investors.Hyundai's portfolio expansion and manufacturing capabilities highlight the growth potential and investment in the automotive market. The increased competition in the auto space also means that other automakers might have to innovate and enhance their product offerings.\"The increased competition and innovation driven by Hyundai’s enhanced financial strength post-IPO could push other automakers to reassess their growth potential and market positioning, positively re-rating the sector,\" said Saji John, Senior Research analyst, Geojit Financial Services.Conversely, if the listing has been perceived as overvalued then it can negatively impact.The re-rating will be driven by increased investor interest and capital inflows into the auto sector and higher valuation multiples for auto companies, reflecting their growth potential.How Hyundai India IPO could keep listed rivals like Maruti on edgeFurther, accelerated adoption of electric and hybrid technologies propelled by heightened competition could also play a significant role in positive re-rating for the sector.\"This re-rating would likely be gradual and dependent on how well Hyundai and its competitors succeed in harnessing new market dynamics gained once they go public,\" said Atul Parakh, CEO of Bigul.Hyundai has planned an investment of Rs 32,000 crore in the country over the next 10 years as the company seeks to aggressively invest in new products, future advanced technology, and R\u0026D capabilities in Indian operations.\"We expect a re-rating in the sector with the IPO debut.
