Earlier, it surged nearly 23%. Ether fell more than 6%.The moves began late Friday after the launch of a new meme coin announced on Trump's social media accounts and issued on the Solana blockchain. \"Official Trump\" (TRUMP) has a market cap of more than $5 billion and is the largest meme coin on the Solana network, according to CoinGecko.That move came ahead of Trump's inauguration Monday, which is widely expected to usher in a new era of innovation and productivity in the crypto industry, and on the day crypto villain Gary Gensler ended his term as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.Solana is the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, excluding stablecoins. It was created in 2020 as a faster and cheaper alternative to Ethereum and now hosts some of the most popular meme coins like dogwifhat and Pudgy Penguins, as well as decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming projects.The token has become so popular asset managers are seeking to issue exchange traded funds tracking its price. The decision deadline for potential ETFs from Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares and Canary is approaching Jan. 25. ProShares on Friday evening also filed for four different ETFs based on SOL. If approved this year, SOL ETFs may only attract a fraction of the assets that flowed into bitcoin ETFs in their first year of trading, according to JPMorgan.SOL gained 85% in 2024.
