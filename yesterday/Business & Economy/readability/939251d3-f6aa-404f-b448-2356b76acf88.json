A breakout above 23,400 is crucial to trigger fresh buying interest, while immediate support stands at 23,100, according to Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. Traders should watch for a decisive move to gauge market direction and plan strategies accordingly.AgenciesNifty opened gap down and traded volatile on Friday, closing 109 points lower. The counter-trend rally from the past three sessions ended at the 40-hour moving average (23,390), resuming its decline.Nifty on the weekly chart formed a small bullish candle with minor upper and lower shadows on Friday. Technically, this weekly market action signals the formation of a Doji candle pattern. Normally a Doji pattern after a reasonable weakness could be an impending reversal signal post-confirmation.The short-term trend of the Nifty remains weak amidst range movement. A decisive upside above 23,400 could only open renewed buying enthusiasm in the market. Immediate support is placed at 23,100, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities.According to the open interest (OI) data, the highest OI on the call side was observed at 23,300 and 23,500 strike prices, while on the put side, the highest OI was at 23,200 strike price followed by 23,000.What should traders do? Here’s what analysts said:Jatin Gedia, Mirae Asset SharekhanNifty opened gap down and witnessed a volatile day of trade on Friday. Intraday, it witnessed wild swings in both directions and ultimately closed in the red down 109 points. On the daily charts, the counter-trend rally of the last three trading sessions has fizzled out at the 40-hour moving average (23,390) and resumed its fall. On the downside, we expect the Nifty to slip towards the psychological level of 23,000 and below that it can potentially slip towards 22,670. Failure of a follow-through selling pressure on the downside can lead to a consolidation within 23,100 – 23,300.Rupak De, LKP SecuritiesThe Nifty remained under bearish pressure for yet another session. Sentiment remains weak as the index declined after encountering resistance at a crucial moving average. This bearish sentiment may persist in the short term or as long as the index remains below 23,400. On the downside, it could drift toward 23,000. A decisive break below 23,000 might trigger a broader market correction. Conversely, 23,400 is likely to remain a strong resistance level.Devarsh Vakil, HDFC SecuritiesDespite experiencing significant intraday volatility of over 200 points, the Nifty index found crucial support at 23,100, from where it staged an impressive recovery of more than 100 points. While the index shed nearly a per cent this week, it managed to close well above its weekly lows. The Nifty faces immediate support at 23,100, a breach of which could trigger further downside. On the upside, the index may encounter resistance at 23,391 and 23,500 levels.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.
