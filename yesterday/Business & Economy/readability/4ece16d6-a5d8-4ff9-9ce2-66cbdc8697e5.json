  "text": "In his own mind, President Trump is a four-dimensional dealmaker who always outsmarts his counterparties. In his real-world trade war, however, Trump has shown his cards to his most potent adversary and revealed some of his constraints. Several weeks of manic tariff activity by Trump and mass confusion in financial markets have finally provided some clarity: Though Trump wants to remake America’s entire trade system, his real target is China. Through April 9, Trump had imposed new tariffs on imports from virtually every country, plus additional import taxes on certain product categories including automobiles, steel and aluminum. Nobody got a reprieve. As financial markets cratered, Trump finally backed down on April 9 by suspending most of his country-specific “reciprocal” tariffs for at least 90 days, until early July. The one notable exception is China, which got the opposite treatment: even higher tariffs. The Trump tariff on Chinese imports is now 145%, up from about 6%, on average, when Trump took office and trained his sights on the world’s No. 2 economy. The tariff rate is so high that it’s “an effective blockade on Chinese imports,” according to Heidi Crebo-Rediker, former chief economist at the State Department and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet That leaves China in a uniquely adversarial position with Trump. China has retaliated against the Trump tariffs far more aggressively than most other US trade partners, including many that didn’t retaliate at all and instead offered to make concessions. The China tariff on American goods is now 125%, raised from 84% on Friday, and Beijing has taken other measures to punish American businesses. China’s rhetoric has also been far more bellicose than anybody else’s, with its Commerce Ministry saying in a statement that China “will fight to the end.” China would avoid a trade war if it could, but it’s a proud country led by a stubborn autocrat, President Xi Jinping, who undoubtedly resents Trump’s trade bullying. Xi and his cadre also view China as a rightful superpower trying to claw its way to parity with the United States, and maybe beyond. Xi has preached a national creed of self-reliance in recent years, and he may very well view a trade war with Trump as a crucible China must pass through on its way to economic greatness. Xi has some advantages. For one thing, Trump’s tariffs are a tax on American businesses and consumers, not on Chinese exporters, which is why the first line of damage is to US stock prices. Tariffs drive down stock prices because they raise costs for businesses, lowering prospects for future earnings. They hurt Chinese exporters too, since the tariffs effectively raise the cost of their products, leaving American buyers looking for other providers or simply buying less. But the US stock market feels the damage first because stock prices are, in effect, a predictor of future economic developments — which markets now consider to be bad.",
