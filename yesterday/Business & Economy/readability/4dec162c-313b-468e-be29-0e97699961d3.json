  "text": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock climbed as much as 12% in premarket trading on Wednesday after the tech company announced a positive update on its plans to avoid being delisted by the Nasdaq and outlined an ambitious new revenue goal for 2026. On Tuesday, the company told investors it now expects to submit delayed filings to the SEC by the Nasdaq's Feb. 25 deadline to avoid delisting. Super Micro said it \"continues to work diligently toward the filing\" of its delayed annual and quarterly reports to the US Securities and Exchange Commission and \"believes it will make such filings by February 25.\" The company had put off submission of the filings following a scathing report published last year by short-selling firm Hindenburg Research accusing the server maker of accounting violations. Super Micro is a rival to Dell (DELL), which makes computer servers using Nvidia's (NVDA) latest Blackwell AI chips. Super Micro's CEO Charles Liang said on a call with investors late Tuesday, \"I believe we have potential to reach $40 billion for fiscal year '26.\" After the bell on Tuesday, Super Micro reported preliminary second quarter earnings for its fiscal 2025 that missed Wall Street’s estimates. The company said it expects to record a revenue of $5.6 billion to $5.7 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31, below the $5.95 billion expected by Wall Street analysts, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. The company cut its revenue guidance for the 2025 fiscal year to a range between $23.5 billion and $25 billion, lower than its prior range of $26 billion to $30 billion. SMCI shares sank as much as 19% after the bell on Tuesday in an initial reaction to the earnings results before reversing direction. Liang added on his call with investors Tuesday evening that the server maker has a \"confidential product under development\" to support that claim. Analysts tracked by Bloomberg had forecast 2026 revenue closer to $30 billion. Super Micro said last week that its server systems for data centers using Nvidia's Blackwell AI chips are now fully available. Super Micro's business update comes after a turbulent year in which the company faced ongoing controversies in the wake of the Hindenburg report. The US Department of Justice reportedly launched a probe into Super Micro’s accounting practices. The firm's delayed annual and quarterly SEC filings put it at risk of being delisted by the Nasdaq, and its accountant resigned. The Nasdaq recently granted Super Micro an extension to submit the filings by Feb. 25. The company has hired a new accountant, and the server maker said an independent review of its business found no evidence of misconduct.",
