  "text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) investors have grown used to positive surprises. The top artificial intelligence (AI) chip designer has surpassed analysts' earnings estimates and delivered double- or triple-digit growth quarter after quarter in recent times. This is thanks to Nvidia's strength in this booming chip market and the company's move to go all-in on AI, offering customers a full selection of related products and services. And this tech powerhouse didn't disappoint in its fourth-quarter and fiscal 2025 full-year report last week, reporting better-than-expected revenue and net income that surged to record levels. On top of this, Blackwell — Nvidia's new game-changing architecture — blasted onto the scene in the company's fastest product ramp ever. Nvidia offered various details about its market position and what's ahead for AI, signaling that growth is far from over. After this kind of report, you might expect Nvidia's stock to surge. But in fact, it didn't. The stock slipped more than 9% on Thursday in the trading session following the report, then went on to advance a little less than 4% on Friday. So, after such a positive earnings report, why isn't the stock taking off? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images. First, a summary of the Nvidia story so far. As mentioned, the company is the leader in the AI chip market, with its graphics processing units (GPUs) being the most sought-after for critical tasks such as training and inferencing large language models (LLMs). This has resulted in ongoing high demand for its chips and other products, helping quarterly revenue soar beyond a full year of revenue as recently as two years ago. Nvidia is an early player in the space, so it has a first-to-market advantage. However, it's the company's commitment to innovation that has kept its leadership going. The tech giant pledges to update its GPUs annually, an enormous task that the company is executing well. Blackwell launched during the fourth quarter, generating $11 billion in revenue right out of the gate. CEO Jensen Huang says demand remains \"extraordinary\" as the world's biggest tech companies pile into this new customizable product. It offers them a selection of chips, networking options, and more. Nvidia said during its earnings call that large cloud service providers — this brings to mind companies like Amazon or Microsoft, for example — make up half its data center revenue. These are players with solid financials and big budgets, meaning they have what it takes to keep investing in premium chips and related products, a positive sign for Nvidia.",
