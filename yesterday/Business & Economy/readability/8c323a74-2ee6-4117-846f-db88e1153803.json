Both stocks trade at significantly higher valuations compared to Britannia and Bharat Petroleum, which are being excluded from the index.The changes would make Nifty's valuations look more expensive, a key factor for the unrelenting selling by foreign investors in Indian equities since October.\"The structural shift in Nifty composition towards high-growth, high-valuation stocks will likely continue pushing the index's PE higher,\" said Vinod Karki, equity strategist at ICICI Securities. \"On a like-to-like basis, Nifty would have appeared 8-10% cheaper with a trailing PE of 20 and FY26 PE of 17.9, assuming 2018 index constituents had not changed.\"AgenciesZomato which was listed in 2021 is currently trading at a PE of 341 times its trailing 12-month earnings while Jio Financial, the demerged financial entity from Reliance Industries trading at 126 times, as per the NSE website. The PE of outgoing stocks - Britannia and Bharat Petroleum - are at 53 times and 8.5 times, respectively.Nifty has corrected 11.6% since October 1 last year, helping its PE ratio soften by 16.45% during this period. Even after the recent declines, Indian equities remain among the most expensive in emerging markets. Taiwan, the second most expensive among emerging markets, is trading at a PE of 18.75 times, while China and South Korea are trading at around 10. Analysts said index inclusion norms must be tweaked as current rules allow the addition of non-profitable businesses too.\"Over time, as more such companies get listed and outperform, they will secure their place in the Nifty 100 and eventually the Nifty 50, given that the current methodology does not exclude non-profitable businesses,\" said Abhilash Pagaria, head of Nuvama Alternative \u0026 Quantitative Research. \"This structural shift suggests that the traditional PE framework may need a revised perspective to account for the evolving market composition.\"On September 30 last year, Bharat Electronics and Trent were added to the Nifty50 index when they were trading at a PE of 49 and 155 times. They were added in place of LTI Mindtree and Divi's Lab, which were trading at a PE of 40 and 86 times, respectively.\"The trend is peculiar given that the divergence of PE of incoming and outgoing stocks at the time of index changes was very high and above normal levels,\" said Karki. \"However, the bulk of earnings growth still comes from financials and energy, which have seen a contrasting trend of valuation compression.\"Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
