  "description": "Mrs. Meyer’s is a hugely successful line of soaps and cleansers named for a real Mrs. Meyer: a no-nonsense Iowa homemaker who raised nine kids, including the brand’s founder. When Monica Nassif started Mrs. Meyer’s, she’d already launched an upscale cleaning brand, but it was too pricey for the mass market. Worried that another company might muscle into her lane, Monica decided to knock herself off: she launched Mrs. Meyer’s with an elegant design and exotic fragrances– but at a price point that allowed her to target Target. Monica’s mom Thelma became a beloved mascot for the brand, which–after spreading to sinks across America — was eventually acquired by S.C. Johnson.This episode was produced by Kerry Thompson with music by Ramtin Arablouei. Edited by Neva Grant, with research from Carla Esteves.
