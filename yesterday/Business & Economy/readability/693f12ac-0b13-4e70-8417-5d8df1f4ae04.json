The funding includes debt and convertibles. Foreign lenders and domestic mutual funds are participating. JSW Paints will raise operating company debt. Convertibles are at the JSW Group level. Sajjan Jindal Family Trust sold a stake in JSW Infrastructure. The deal aims to make JSW Paints India's fourth-largest paint company.AgenciesOn June 27, Sajjan Jindal's JSW Paints had announced a ₹12,915-crore deal to acquire Akzo Nobel India, with the aim to become India's fourth-largest paint company.Mumbai: The JSW Group has firmed up a ₹9,300-crore financing package to fund the buyout of Akzo Nobel's local operations, stitching together a mix of debt, convertibles, and loan against shares at the promoter level, multiple people familiar with the tri-level fundraising initiatives told ET.The deal involves three separate tranches - an operating company-level debt of around ₹3,300 crore, a ₹3,000-crore convertible instrument at holdco, and about ₹3,000 crore loan against shares at the promoter level.The operating company debt of ₹3,300 crore is being raised through a syndicate of foreign lenders, including SMBC, MUFG, Mizuho, Barclays, JPMorgan and DBS, sources said. The loan is priced at 10% plus withholding tax, they said.Another ₹3,000 crore is being raised via a loan against shares from domestic mutual funds, including Kotak Mutual Fund structured at an interest rate of around 8.5%, said one of the people cited above. This tranche is backed by the shares of a listed group company, helping bridge the funding requirement at the promoter level. An Additional fundraise of ₹3,000 crore is through convertibles at the holding company level from private credit funds.Spokespersons of JSW, MUFG, Kotak and JP Morgan did not respond to ET's queries until the publication of this report, while SMBC, Mizuho, Barclays and DBS could not be immediately reached for their respective comments.
