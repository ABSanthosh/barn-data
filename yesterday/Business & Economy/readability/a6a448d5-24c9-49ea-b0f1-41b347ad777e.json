  "text": "Mumbai: 'KiKos' are back. 'Seagulls' are flying. 'Ekis' look tempting, and 'Tarfs' are crossed. These aren't fragments of magic realism. They are scraps of conversations on synthetic foreign currency derivatives, wafting across bank dealing rooms and corporate treasuries grappling with a volatile rupee and unsettling headlines. Welcome to the world of exotics, albeit in a tamer avatar.After years, choppy markets have revived the trades on over-the-counter (OTC) currency derivatives as corporates fish around for fancy deals at modest (or, even zero) cost to guard themselves from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.Companies, particularly those with large imports or cheaper (yet riskier) foreign currency borrowings, are signing different kinds of derivative contracts - some vanilla variety, others more complex - with banks whose derivative desks have turned active after months of dollar selling by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to back the rupee.Agencies Range-bound View Taking a view that the rupee would not suffer a free fall, but move in a range after three-six months, many companies have entered into target redemption forwards (Tarfs) and Seagulls contracts with banks. Tarfs offers a cheaper rate at which an importer could buy dollars or a higher exchange rate at which an exporter could sell dollars than the prevailing rate in a simple forwards contract. But, under a Tarfs deal, the favourable contract rate is no longer available once the total gains of the company cross a certain amount.Thus, if the rupee does not stay range-bound and falls rapidly, the importer - having exhausted its quota of Tarf gains - could find itself exposed to a much higher dollar in future. \"If handled well, exotic options can be a powerful tool to enhance hedge performance across exports, imports, and loans. Structured correctly, they can sometimes be safer than forwards. However, proper understanding and experience is crucial to minimise unexpected risks,\" said Samir Lodha, MD of QuantArt, which advises several business groups.\"A company must follow a few golden rules: firstly, ensure protection doesn't get vanished; secondly, obligations don't get knocked in at the wrong time; thirdly, eed to have the knowledge about the mark-to-market impact; and, lastly, knowing and factoring in for the worst-case scenario,\" he said.Saving costCompanies often enter into OTC derivatives to cut costs as these contracts can be structured in ways where the premium to be paid is much lower than they would have to fork out for buying dollars in a regular forward contract. Many deals entail a combination of buying and selling of options, so that premium paid in buying the option is offset to a great extent (and sometime entirely) by the premium received from selling an option. In Seagulls deals, which are comparatively less risky and popular among many corporate treasurers, a corporate would 'buy call' at a lower strike, 'sell call' at a higher strike, and also 'sell put'. Buying call means the 'right' to buy dollars at the strike rate; selling call means the 'obligation' or compulsion to sell dollars at another strike rate; and, selling put means the obligation to buy dollars at yet another rate. Though cost-effective for an importer who is able to fix the upper rate at which it can buy dollars, the gains are frozen beyond a point. Also, the importer would be obliged to buy dollars (thanks to selling a call) even if the dollar depreciates below its expectations. Here too the company feels the dollar-rupee would be range-bound.Similarly, in an 'European knock-in' structure, an importer buys call and sells put-with the condition that the put obligation to buy dollars at a higher rate will be triggered only if the dollar depreciates below an agreed level.Some play aroundAccording to market sources, some banks and companies may be peddling products which could be double-edged swords.“While RBI has banned banks from selling leveraged products and risk-taking among corporates is lower today than what it was 20 years ago, I will not be surprised if some of the corporates are striking deals that are not just confined to risk mitigation. Even in a Seagulls, which involves three options, a corporate can find itself in a substantial marked-to-market loss once the sell call price is breached. Companies have risk policies but boards have given CFOs the leeway,” said Haresh Desai, a market veteran and founder-partner of Rajwade Treasury Consultants.In leveraged products, the gains and losses are disproportionately high. Some companies play it safe, putting a stop-loss on Seagulls.In KiKo deals which some are selling, the company is offered an attractive rate which knocks in when the exchange rate touches a level but gets knocked out (and the protection disappears) when another level is crossed. Or, in inexpensive KO (knock-out) contracts, a company’s cost would be negligible, but the protection would disappear if the exchange rate breaches a level that may look distant and unlikely today.“The problem is, and which always existed, treasuries sometimes position themselves as profit centres which they are strictly not. And, the reality of finance is that there is no reward without taking risks,” said Desai.Companies entering into derivatives have to declare to banks that a board-approved risk management policy is in place, and banks have to assess whether a company has the understanding and wherewithal to deal with the contract, according to the RBI policy. But bankers as well as corporate treasurers have enough latitude to play around.",
