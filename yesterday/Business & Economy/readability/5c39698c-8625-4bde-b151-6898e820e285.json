  "text": "In a recent series of transactions, Beehouse, LLC, a major shareholder of Lowell Farms Inc. (OTC:LOWLF), sold a substantial number of shares, totaling $38,198. The sales occurred over several dates, with prices ranging from $0.0098 to $0.045 per share. The transactions, which involved subordinate voting shares, were executed between July and October 2024. Beehouse, LLC, along with Beehouse Manager, LLC and Gregory Parker Heyman, are listed as reporting owners. According to the filings, the shares were indirectly owned, with Beehouse, LLC acting as the investment manager for the funds holding the shares. Following these transactions, the total shares owned by the reporting parties have been reduced significantly, with the final sale on October 15, 2024, leaving no shares owned. The transactions were filed with the SEC on November 14, 2024. InvestingPro Insights The recent share sales by Beehouse, LLC align with several concerning trends highlighted by InvestingPro data for Lowell Farms Inc. (OTC:LOWLF). The company's financial health appears precarious, as evidenced by its negative gross profit of -$8.61 million and an alarming gross profit margin of -38.94% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. This poor profitability is further underscored by the operating income margin of -79.38% during the same period. InvestingPro Tips reveal that Lowell Farms is \"quickly burning through cash\" and \"operates with a significant debt burden.\" These factors may have influenced Beehouse, LLC's decision to divest its holdings. The company's stock performance has been notably weak, with InvestingPro data showing a staggering -93.86% one-year price total return as of the latest available data. Despite a recent uptick with a 92.5% one-month price total return, the longer-term outlook remains challenging. An InvestingPro Tip notes that the stock \"has taken a big hit over the last six months,\" which is quantified by the -84.43% six-month price total return. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 14 additional tips for Lowell Farms, providing deeper insights into the company's financial situation and market position.
