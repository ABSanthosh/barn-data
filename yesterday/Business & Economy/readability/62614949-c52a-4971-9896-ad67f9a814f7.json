California's numbers are especially striking, with a massive 238% increase, per ATTOM's recent report, as detailed by Business Insider. This spike points to growing pressures in the sector. This trend is likely influenced by rising interest rates and lingering effects from post-pandemic shifts in demand, particularly for office spaces. States like New York and Florida are also seeing big foreclosure increases, up 48% and 49%, respectively. Don't Miss: ‘Beating the market through ethical real estate investing' — this platform aims to give tenants equity in the homes they live in while scoring 17.38% average annual returns for investors – here’s how to join with just $100 Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever. The broader economic shifts are weighing heavily on commercial real estate. Debt continues to mature while demand remains weak. Office spaces have been hit particularly hard as businesses adapt to hybrid work models. Many are downsizing or shedding traditional office space. This transformation leaves landlords with vacancies they may struggle to fill. The dynamic, combined with stricter lending terms, is creating a perfect storm of financial stress for property owners. It could explain the rise in foreclosures. Industry experts, as polled by Business Insider, are divided on the outlook. Some see foreclosures continuing to rise, especially in markets where properties are difficult to repurpose or reposition. Many commercial properties — particularly aging office buildings — require substantial investment to be converted into housing or mixed-use spaces. These projects are often too costly for landlords already struggling with mortgage payments and other operating expenses. Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. However, a recent report from Moody’s offers a more optimistic view, noting an uptick in commercial property transactions in September, the first rise in two years. This increase suggests that, while distressed sales may be on the horizon, there could also be buyers looking to snap up properties at lower prices, potentially spurring a market rebound.",
