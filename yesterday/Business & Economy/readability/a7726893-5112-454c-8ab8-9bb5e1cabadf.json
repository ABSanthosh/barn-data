The five-year US treasury currently yields 4.6%.AgenciesDuring an investor call recently, Vedanta Group said that they are planning to raise up to $1 billion to prepay and refinance high-cost debt, as reported on January 3.Mumbai: Vedanta Resources (VRL) is likely to raise $1 billion through a dual-tranche issuance of US dollar benchmark senior unsecured guaranteed notes, primarily to refinance its 2028 and 2026 bonds.The fund is being raised by VRL subsidiary Vedanta Resources Finance II.\"The dual-tranche bond offering has attracted strong investor demand, with order books exceeding $3.4 billion, including $70.75 million from joint lead manager interest,\" a source close to the development said.The issuances, structured under the 144A/Reg S format, include a 5.5-year tranche and an 8.25-year tranche, with settlement expected on January 24, 2025.AgenciesFinal price guidance for the 5.5-year tranche has been set at 9.475%, while the 8.25-year tranche is at 9.850%, which is tight pricing given the current market environment, the source added. The five-year US treasury currently yields 4.6%.The transaction is expected to raise a maximum of $1.1 billion, with allocations likely to be evenly split between the two tranches. The first tranche, a 5.5-year, non-call 2.5-year note, initially had price guidance of 9.875%, while the second tranche, an 8.25-year non-call 3-year note, was initially priced at 10.250%.Twin Star Holdings and Welter Trading are the subsidiary guarantors for the bonds. The issuance includes covenants, such as a negative lien on brand fee receivables and debt incurrence limits, while requiring minimum financial coverage and leverage ratios for both the parent and subsidiaries. The transaction is led by Barclays, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, First Abu Dhabi Bank, Mashreq and Standard Chartered Bank.Last week, Vedanta raised a $300 million loan from Barclays, First Abu Dhabi Bank, and Mashreq to refinance its existing April 2026 and December 2028 bonds. The loan was raised at SOFR plus 440 basis points, bringing the all-in cost to 8.7%, lower than the 9.25% to 13.875% on its older bonds.Since September 2024, VRL has been working on reducing its funding costs and interest burden through refinancing high-cost debt. It has lowered its borrowing costs to close to single digits to improve its debt profile and liquidity. However, VRL has a three-year clear runway before it faces the debt wall with chunky debt maturities beginning mid-2028, according to CreditSights.During an investor call recently, Vedanta Group said that they are planning to raise up to $1 billion to prepay and refinance high-cost debt, as reported on January 3. The company has been looking to address $400 million bonds maturing in 2028 with a 13.875% coupon and $600 million non-guaranteed bonds due in 2026 with a 9.25% coupon.\"Vedanta has decided to tap the market in January, as the fundraising activity is relatively low during this period,\" said a source. \"The company expects a positive response as it is working towards reducing its funding costs to single digits and getting a credit rating upgrade.\"Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2024 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
