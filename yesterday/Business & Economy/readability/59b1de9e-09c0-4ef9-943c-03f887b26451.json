  "text": "Technical charts, including relative strength index (RSI), indicate a continuation of the ongoing uptrend. However, with India VIX remaining above 17 levels, elevated volatility persists, warranting caution. According to technical analysts, a move beyond 23,058 would further strengthen the bullish outlook. Stocks such as Ambuja Cement, GMR Airports, HDFC Life, Pidilite Industries, Marico, HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank, and Bajaj Finance have formed bullish patterns.Tired of too many ads? Remove AdsJATIN GEDIA TECHNICAL RESEARCH ANALYST, MIRAE ASSET SHAREKHANWhere is Nifty headed this week? We believe a panic bottom for Nifty at 21,743 is in place. As per the Elliott wave principle, Nifty has completed a complex corrective pattern from a high of 26,277 to a low of 21,743. Nifty futures chart shows a double bottom pattern that has bullish implications. Nifty has recovered more than 50% of the most recent fall from 23,870 to 21,743 which puts the bulls in a position of advantage. On the upside, the resistance zone is placed at 23,000–23,058 which coincides with the 20-day simple moving average, and 61.82% Fibonacci retracement level of the 23,870–21,743 decline. Failure to sustain above 23,100 or a breach below 22,350 shall weaken the bullish structure. What could investors do? Investors should consider the current decline as an opportunity to accumulate stocks that have witnessed significant correction from 52-week highs, like Reliance Industries (30%), Bajaj Auto (45%), HUL (29%), Larsen \u0026 Toubro (25%) and Titan (25%). Look at high dividend-yield stocks like Coal India, IOC and some of the relative out performing stocks like BEL, Bajaj Fin, Bajaj Finserv, UltraTech Cement, Bharti Airtel, and Grasim.Tired of too many ads? Remove Ads Agencies ARPAN SHAH SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, MONARCH NETWORTH CAPITALWhere is Nifty headed this week? India VIX’s significant jump last week suggests that the market could turn volatile in coming days. If VIX remains in 20-23 zone, then the index may trade volatile, and the possibility of a further selloff in case India VIX breaks above 23. Nifty is likely to trade in 21,800– 23,200. A breakout from this range would suggest a move of 500-700 points in that direction. Bank Nifty, which has been resilient for the last few weeks, may also witness volatility. It is likely to trade in the broader range of 49,000-52,000. What could investors do? Globally-exposed sectors like metal, pharma, and IT may witness volatility. On the long side, traders might keep an eye on FMCG and domestic demand-driven sectors such as cement and insurance, which will be insulated from global volatility. PSU banking stocks are likely to outperform the sector and investors should use any dip as a buying opportunity. Bank of Baroda and Canara Bank are the top picks from the sector. Ambuja Cement, GMR Airports, HDFC Life, Pidilite, and Marico have closed with bullish formation; while Tata Motors, Muthoot Fin, and Infosys have closed with bearish formation, and any uptick should be used as a short-selling opportunity.SACCHITANAND UTTEKARVP-TECHNICAL \u0026 DERIVATIVES, TRADEBULLS SECURITIESWhere is Nifty headed this week? The bullish thrusting line pattern on Nifty’s weekly chart signals a continuation of the uptrend, reinforcing the base at 21,960. A potential double bottom would be confi rmed above 23,850, setting the stage for a sustained bullish move in the months ahead. Options data indicates strong support at 22,500 and 22,000, with 23,000 acting as a temporary hurdle. A breakout above this zone could quickly push the index towards 23,800–24,000. Momentum traders should hold their longs as far as 22,250 holds on a closing basis, preferring pullback entries over chasing breakouts. Aggressive longs are only advised if Nifty sustains above 22,850–23,000. Tired of too many ads? Remove AdsWhat could investors do? The RBI has raised India’s FY26 GDP growth forecast to 6.5% and trimmed infl ation outlook to 4%, a move likely to fuel optimism in banking and fi nancial stocks, particularly NBFCs. Meanwhile, forecast of a normal monsoon is expected to uplift sentiment across domestic FMCG, auto, and cement sectors.
