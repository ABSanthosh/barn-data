  "text": "Big changes are happening with Social Security, and you have questions. My recent columns drew thousands of comments, largely centered on three big themes: fear of delayed checks and crumbling customer service at the Social Security Administration, Roth conversions on tax-deferred retirement accounts, and heart-wrenching explanations of why filing for benefits at 62 is not always a matter of choice. The Trump administration has made considerable and controversial changes, including massive staff and field office cuts, limiting phone service. and significantly ramping up the amount it garnishes per monthly check from Social Security beneficiaries who receive overpayments. These changes are impacting the nearly 74 million retired senior citizens and disabled workers who currently receive benefits and the millions more on the cusp of doing so. The following is an edited sample of those 5,000-plus comments and my take on them. I am 62, retiring soon, and I’m ready to start my Social Security checks because I don’t have any savings. I have an appointment with Social Security on June 9. When will I receive my first payment? Kerry Hannon: It typically takes at least a month, or 30 days, to receive your first Social Security check after your application is processed. It could be 45 days in some cases. The precise timing of your check delivery relies on processing times at the Social Security Administration. During a recent operations meeting in April at SSA, an official from the agency reported that the field offices “are struggling right now to keep pace with the timeliness this year.” The fact that they are aware of this is a good thing, and, if they take action, will have this under control by the time you apply for your benefit. In general, however, I recommend applying up to four months before you want to start receiving benefits. I know a number of people who have claimed their Social Security benefits before their full retirement kicks in due to age bias in hiring. They can’t get an interview for even part-time jobs, let alone anything that has benefits. The only guaranteed income they can find is Social Security. Sadly, this comment rings true. When you can’t find a new job after a layoff, involuntary retirement might be your last option, which, in turn, forces you to claim benefits early. I’m an advocate for delaying benefits until age 70 if you can. But not everyone has the financial guardrails to pay for living expenses until they tap in or a steady income that allows them to wait it out. You can start receiving your Social Security retirement benefits at age 62. You’re entitled to full benefits only when you reach your full retirement age (FRA). For example, if you turn 62 in 2025, your benefit would be roughly 30% lower than it would be at your full retirement age of 67.",
