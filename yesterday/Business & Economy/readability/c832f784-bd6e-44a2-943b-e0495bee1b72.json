It's not that they don't have a broader sense of where the market might be headed.

Remove AdsSince April 2, when he unleashed the slew of tariffs on imports from various countries, global equities have revolted with US stocks alone losing about $6.6 trillion in market value on Thursday and Friday. After being relatively indifferent to the US announcements on Thursday, Indian markets joined in on Friday, shedding ₹10 lakh crore in a single day.The extent of this slump on Wall Street was not anticipated. Many thought a lot of the uncertainty around the tariff announcements was already priced in as some US tech giant stocks had begun falling since early March, especially after Trump said, \"What I have to do is build a strong country. You can't really watch the stock market.\" The earlier prognosis was that the market would settle down after an initial reaction. But that was then. The tone is shifting today. Few expected Trump to unleash reciprocal tariffs of such magnitude on what he dubbed Liberation Day. That, coupled with China's retaliatory tariffs, deepened the trade conflict between the world's two biggest economic powers. The outcomes of this could be a perilous combination of a global downturn and rising inflation, mainly in the US, which restricts the American central bank's wherewithal to cut interest rates aggressively - a rulebook that most investors are familiar with. While the global picture turns hazy, investors in India seem a lot less worried. The prediction is that the direct impact of retaliatory tariffs on India could be cushioned by the country's limited dependence on exports. This is partly accurate, but it's not about India alone. A US downturn and a prolonged global risk-off mood will have ripple effects on domestic capex and credit growth. After all, the US has been the world's biggest consumer and also the most dominant source of capital.Tired of too many ads? Remove AdsAmid the gloom, there is still hope that the current set of US tariffs is merely Trump browbeating trading partners into giving better deals. Global macro watchers and strategists have chalked out various scenarios that could play out over the next few weeks.The optimists are of the view that a continued sell-off on Wall Street could pressure the Trump administration to dial back a lot of its tariffs. According to Ed Yardeni, president of Wall Street firm Yardeni Research, stock market \"vigilantes\" are at play because they are averse to tariffs and mass firings of US government workers. \"If Trump doesn't pivot, the stock market vigilantes will continue to destroy more of the wealth of Americans, who are already calling their congressional representatives to complain that they are getting poorer, not wealthier,\" he said in a note.Strategists are also sketching out scenarios in which negotiations between the US and trading partners would result in tariff rates being cut. But these situations will merely remain simulations till there is further clarity on what the Trump administration wants to do. The likelihood of shifting goalposts remains.Unless the US reverses the tariffs or even most of them, all other scenarios are still pointing to global slowdown, which must reflect in share valuations. India's current valuations are still rich in both the global and historical contexts. Nomura's Asia equity strategist Chetan Seth said the risks over tariffs need to be adequately reflected in valuations. \"We suspect Asian stocks will likely have to go lower before we reach a stage where risk-reward becomes decisively more favorable for Asian equity investors to go on some bargain hunting,\" said Seth.For now, seasoned investors are sticking to capital preservation. Cash, gold and short-term fixed income instruments are their preferred investment choices. For them, equity investing is most conducive when growth is visibly strong or stock prices are at throwaway levels. Neither of these factors is giving them comfort at the moment.",
