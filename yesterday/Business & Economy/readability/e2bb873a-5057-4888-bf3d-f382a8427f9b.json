  "description": "Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe joins Guy on the Advice Line to answer questions from three early-stage founders. He also gets into how trade policies and shifting tariffs are impacting the automotive supply chain. First, we meet Ashley from Southern California, who’s deciding whether to take outside capital to take her altruistic ice cream brand worldwide. Next, Kwadwo in North Carolina is debating leaving his full-time job to go all in on his handcrafted furniture brand. Then Robert in British Columbia is looking to grow his backcountry skiing invention beyond the early adopters.Thank you to the founders of Vedder’s Organic Ice Cream, Crafted Glory and Zoa Engineering for being part of the show. If you’d like to be featured on a future Advice Line episode, leave us a one-minute message that tells us about your business and a specific question you’d like answered.
