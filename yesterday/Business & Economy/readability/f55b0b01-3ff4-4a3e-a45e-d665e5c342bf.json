  "text": "Melania Trump recently claimed that her son, Barron, was denied a bank account due to \"cancel culture\" after the family left the White House. In her new memoir Melania, released recently, the former first lady expresses frustration over what she describes as politically motivated discrimination. Don't Miss: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market. ‘Beating the market through ethical real estate investing' — this platform aims to give tenants equity in the homes they live in while scoring 17.17% average annual returns for investors – here’s how to join with just $100 \"I was shocked and dismayed to learn that my longtime bank decided to terminate my account and deny my son the opportunity to open a new one,\" she writes. According to her memoir, Melania suggests that the decision was rooted in political bias and raised concerns about civil rights violations. Some speculators, however, suggest that there may be other reasons, such as hefty fines and overdraft fees owed to specific financial institutions by Trump himself, that caused these account closures. See Also: These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends The timing of this incident coincided with the period following the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, although Melania doesn't mention the event directly. She points out that she and Barron felt the sting of \"cancel culture\" during this time. \"It is troubling to see financial services withheld based on political affiliation,\" she stated, calling the decision unfair. Her grievances weren't limited to banking issues. Melania also shared how a media deal she worked on fell through after the backers pulled out, citing personal hatred toward her husband, Donald Trump. She wrote that the private equity firm backing her media initiative refused to honor their agreement despite her efforts to focus on business, not politics. Trending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today. Another incident involved Melania's charitable initiative, the Fostering the Future scholarship program, which provided educational support to foster care children. According to the memoir, a ‘leading tech-education company' partnered with the initiative and later cut ties after her involvement became public.",
