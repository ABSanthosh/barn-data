  "text": "In This Article: We recently published an article titled Billionaire Ken Fisher's 10 Technology Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other technology stocks. Technology stocks have faced heightened volatility in 2025, with market sentiment swinging sharply in response to President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policies. On April 3, tech shares endured their worst day since the COVID-19 pandemic as Trump announced sweeping tariffs on all imported goods, including a 34% duty on Chinese imports, exacerbating fears of a global trade war. An iPhone maker led the steep declines among the \"Magnificent Seven,\" plummeting over 9% due to its reliance on Chinese manufacturing. Other tech giants also fell between 8% and 9%, while semiconductor and PC companies recorded double-digit losses. The tech-heavy NASDAQ tumbled 6%, marking its worst session over five years and deepening its year-to-date loss to more than 14%. Despite the recent turmoil, broader optimism about technology and growth stocks remains underpinned by longer-term trends. Notably, Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management has emphasized that while mega-cap tech firms often face headwinds, they tend to outperform during bullish cycles and reflect broader market confidence. He argues that 2024’s rally was more expansive than many recognize, with tech and communication services stocks leading growth across the board. While tech stocks often decline more in bearish periods, their historical track record of resilience and growth during recoveries continues to make them attractive for long-term investors. This underscores why, even amid significant volatility, tech stocks retain strategic value for portfolios, particularly when the market regains momentum. Signs of a potential rebound appeared later in April, as major indexes recovered modestly on April 24, with tech shares helping lead the rally. Investors responded positively to reports that the U.S. and China had resumed trade talks, despite earlier denials from Beijing. Trump’s announcement that some tariffs might be rolled back helped ease immediate fears, although uncertainty remains high. Analysts noted that the recent tech selloff had left the market oversold, setting the stage for short-term gains. However, mixed earnings reports and rising costs across industries continue to fuel caution, reinforcing the unpredictable nature of trade policy’s impact on tech and broader equity markets. For this article, we scanned Fisher Asset Management’s Q4 2024 13F filings to identify billionaire Ken Fisher's technology stock picks with the highest upside potential. We compiled the tech equities with upside potential higher than 27% at the time of writing this article and discussed why they stood out as sound potential investments. Finally, we ranked the stocks based on the ascending order of their upside potential. To assist readers with more context, we mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock using data from 1,009 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024.",
