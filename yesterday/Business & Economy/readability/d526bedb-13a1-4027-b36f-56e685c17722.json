Under President Donald Trump's crypto plan, America was going to become \"the crypto capital of the world.\" That meant deregulating the crypto market, promoting innovative uses for blockchain technology within the financial markets, and becoming a Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) superpower. Those promises mostly have been kept. The White House even hosted a Crypto Summit on March 7. But broader macroeconomic weakness -- in the form of tariffs and recession fears -- have sent crypto markets tumbling. Cryptocurrencies are down across the board, so it's hard to tell what's hot, and what's not. So let's take a closer look at key Trump priorities for crypto. The three hottest crypto sectors right now are decentralized finance (DeFi), real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and stablecoins. The easiest way to see this is by examining the crypto portfolio of World Liberty Financial, the Trump-affiliated crypto company that uses the tag line, \"Shape a New Era of Finance.\" It went on a highly publicized crypto buying spree ahead of the inauguration as a show of support for Trump's crypto plan. Currently, some of the biggest holdings of World Liberty Financial include Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), Chainlink (CRYPTO: LINK), Ondo, Aave, and Ethena. The company also holds two stablecoins: Tether and USDC. All of these holdings, in one way or another, reflect a core idea of Trump's crypto plan: creating new linkages between the world of traditional finance and the world of decentralized finance. Decentralized finance really just refers to putting the traditional financial system on blockchain rails. Once you have a Layer-1 blockchain like Ethereum, it's possible to build on top of it. You can create new decentralized exchanges for trading digital assets. You can create new ways to borrow and earn money. And you can create enormous value by reducing the inefficiencies of the modern financial system. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is one of the hottest trends on Wall Street right now, and it's supported by top asset managers such as BlackRock. Tokenization refers to the transformation of traditional assets (such as stocks and bonds) into digital assets that can be traded on the blockchain. Once you do that, you can create new efficiencies and open up markets to new participants. For example, it's now possible to tokenize very illiquid assets (such as private equity and real estate) and put it all on the blockchain in the form of tradable crypto tokens.",
