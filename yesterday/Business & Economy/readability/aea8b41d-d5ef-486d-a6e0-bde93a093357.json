In August this year, Religare Enterprises applied to the Registrar of Companies (RoC) for a three-month extension to hold the AGM, which was approved on August 22. However, the Burmans challenged the RoC’s order in the Delhi High Court, which dismissed their writ petition on August 30.  The proposed acquirers then appealed the decision to a division bench, which denied interim relief and issued a notice to the RoC and Religare for counter affidavits. The case is now scheduled for further hearing on November 20, 2024.Also Read",
