The government holds 57.43 per cent in SBI, and that is likely to come down to about 55 per cent after the share sale.Also Read “The issue price will be determined in consultation with book running lead managers,” it said, adding it might offer a discount of not more than 5 per cent on the floor price calculated for the issue.  ALSO READ: SBI cuts short-term retail deposit rates by 15 bps, effective July 15  Citigroup Global Capital Markets, Morgan Stanley India, HSBC Securities, ICICI Securities, Kotak Investment Banking, and SBI Caps are the issue’s lead managers.  SBI’s market capitalisation has gone up from ₹3.25 trillion at the end of March 2021 to ₹7.13 trillion at the end of March 2025, according to its “Analysts Presentation” for 2024-25.
