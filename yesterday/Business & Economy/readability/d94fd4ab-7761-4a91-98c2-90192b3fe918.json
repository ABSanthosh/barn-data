  "text": "By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway on Saturday reported record annual profits and boosting its cash stake to $334.2 billion, as Warren Buffett used his annual shareholder letter to caution Washington to spend money wisely and take care of those who get the \"short straws in life.\" Buffett's admonition came as many investors worry U.S. lawmakers won't rein in soaring fiscal deficits, and could make them worse by extending tax cuts backed by President Donald Trump. The 94-year-old Buffett, the world's sixth-richest person and arguably its most famous investor, also acknowledged his advanced age, telling shareholders he uses a cane and will spend less time fielding their questions at Berkshire's annual meeting on May 3. He nonetheless assured shareholders they would be in good hands after he turns over the conglomerate's reins to Vice Chairman Greg Abel, saying the 62-year-old Abel has \"vividly shown his ability\" to deploy capital. \"It won't be long\" before Abel takes over, Buffett said. Buffett's letter was accompanied by Berkshire's annual report, where it reported a third straight record annual operating profit, rising 27% to $47.44 billion. Quarterly operating profit rose 71% to $14.53 billion, also a record, and which analysts viewed as solid. Net income for the full year totaled $89 billion, including gains from Berkshire's common stock investments such as Apple and American Express. Berkshire's cash stake reflected high business valuations and nine straight quarters of selling more stocks than it bought. The selling included Apple, which remained its largest stock investment. \"Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities,\" Buffett wrote. 'FISCAL FOLLY' This year is Buffett's 60th at the helm of Berkshire, which he transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.03 trillion conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy, industrial, retail and other sectors. \"Berkshire's activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished,\" Buffett said. Buffett said Berkshire will continue preferring equities, primarily U.S. stocks, over cash, even as it resists paying a dividend to shareholders, which it has not done since 1967. He said reinvesting in Berkshire is one reason the Omaha, Nebraska-based company paid $26.8 billion of federal taxes last year, 5% of all payments by corporate America. Buffett himself is worth $149.5 billion, Forbes magazine said,",
