Markets reward companies for thisMumbai: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) plans to introduce a trading window for soon-to-be-listed shares to curb unofficial grey market transactions between the closing day of the initial public offerings (IPOs) and the listing day, said chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch.Speaking at an event in Mumbai on Tuesday, Buch said, Sebi aims to create a structured and regulated platform for securities trading within a controlled framework, eliminating the need for informal market practices.On IPO pricing, the Sebi chief said it is not the regulator's role to control pricing.Sebi's responsibility is to ensure that all critical disclosures and information are made available to investors, enabling them to make informed decisions, Buch said.According to the Association of Investment Bankers of India, 1,000 companies are likely to float their IPOs in the next two fiscals compared to 851 IPOs that hit the market in the last six years.Addressing concerns about IPO disclosure requirements for companies that are yet to be profitable, Buch said two working groups are currently reviewing the guidelines to ensure clarity and consistency.The Sebi chief said the regulator is also focussing on enhancing transparency in corporate governance practices. These include greater scrutiny of resolutions passed at annual general meetings (AGMs) and approvals by audit committees.Buch also underscored that corporate governance standards are set to improve as companies increasingly comply with the spirit of the law. She noted that advanced technology is uncovering digital footprints, making it easier to hold non-compliant entities accountable. Furthermore, whistleblower mechanisms are playing a critical role in promoting accountability.\"There is a good reason not to do the wrong thing. These trends are driving our markets toward respecting not just the letter of the law but also its spirit. Markets reward companies for this,\" she said.Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2024 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
