The group's total market value is still 34% below the levels when the Hindenburg report was released on January 24, 2023, accusing the conglomerate of 'stock price manipulation' and 'accounting fraud'. The silver lining is that the conglomerate's financial parameters are pointing to better health.Out of the 11 Adani stocks listed then, seven are yet to recover to the pre-Hindenburg levels though the Nifty index has rallied 29% since then.
