But now, at least in some markets, a few banks are actually opening brand-new branches. An average of 1,646 branches have closed each year in the U.S. since 2018, according to an analysis of Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. data by Self Financial. California had the most closures, followed by Florida and Illinois. If branch closures were to continue at this rate, the report says there’d be no branches left in the U.S. by 2041. I'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast) Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how Want an extra $1,300,000 when you retire? Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it Invest in Gold Powered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above. The pace picked up in Q1 2025 with a total of 148 branch closures, according to S\u0026P Global Market Intelligence data. That was led by U.S. Bancorp (reporting 50 branch closures) and Wells Fargo \u0026 Co. (reporting 23 branch closures). But, despite this overall decline, some banks are actually building new branches or renovating older ones. Indeed, the American Bankers Association says a “counter trend” has emerged, “gaining momentum over the past two years to where now many of the nation’s largest banks have announced specific plans for widespread branch expansion.” And there’s one state where we’re seeing dozens of new branch openings. Here’s why. Chase plans to open 50 new branches in Massachusetts by 2027, including small towns such as Sudbury (with less than 20,000 people) and Weston (with less than 12,000 people). This is part of a larger expansion the commercial bank announced last year, which involves opening more than 500 new branches and renovating 1,700 locations across the country. “You don’t see it in lower-income neighborhoods,” Eric Rosengren, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, told CBS News. “You see it in wealthy neighborhoods, because even a few wealthy individuals can provide a significant amount of income coming from the wealth management.” That’s because many affluent customers still value face-to-face financial advice. Indeed, JPMorganChase is expanding its ‘affluent’ offering with 14 new J.P. Morgan Financial Centers across four states, for a total of 16 locations — with plans to double that by the end of next year.",
