Upgrade Now In This Article: By Medha Singh and Kanchana Chakravarty (Reuters) -Shares of U.S. companies were under pressure after the latest escalation in Washington's trade war, with new tariffs on Canada and Mexico expected to hit earnings in several sectors, including automobiles, aerospace, retail and housing. Economically sensitive stocks such as airlines and banks led declines on Wall Street's main indexes on Tuesday on the new tariffs. Monday, the benchmark S\u0026P 500 suffered its worst day of this year after the U.S. tariffs were confirmed. [.N] U.S. President Donald Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, effective Tuesday. The action covers more than $900 billion worth of annual U.S. imports from the two countries. Trump also doubled duties on Chinese imports to 20% to punish Beijing over the U.S. fentanyl overdose crisis. The cumulative duty comes on top of up to 25% tariffs imposed during his first term. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, speaking just hours after the U.S. tariffs took effect, announced immediate 25% tariffs on C$30 billion ($20.66 billion) of U.S. imports, with the potential to target an additional C$125 billion in 21 days if necessary. China also responded with additional tariffs of 10%-15% on certain U.S. imports from March 10, while Mexico is poised to swiftly retaliate against its long-standing ally. AUTOMOBILES Shares of U.S. automakers Ford and GM lost 1.9% and 1.6%, respectively, on Tuesday, as the sector is heavily exposed to tariffs due to the integrated nature of auto manufacturing between the three North American nations. S\u0026P Global estimates the new duties on imports from Mexico and Canada could cost affected U.S. carmakers on average 10%-25% of their annual EBITDA. Trump's 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum would also increase costs for the industry, which accounted for 15% of net shipments of iron and steel in 2024, S\u0026P Global said in a note. J.P. Morgan analysts also expect automakers to bear the brunt of direct cost from tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with some pain to be shared with suppliers, dealers and consumers. This could cost General Motors about $14 billion (or substantially all of the earnings before interest and taxes it guides to globally this year) and Ford about $6 billion (or ~75% of the EBIT it guides to globally this year), they said. Ford has three plants in Mexico. It exported just under 196,000 cars to North America in the first half of 2024, with 90% going to the U.S., according to Mexico's AMIA. Stellantis makes 39% of its North American vehicles in Mexico or Canada, while General Motors and Ford Motor make 36% and 18% there, respectively, according to a November report from Barclays.",
