  "text": "When it comes to tax planning, timing can be everything, especially with major changes on the horizon. President Donald Trump’s recent signing of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” (OBBB) into law will usher in sweeping updates to the U.S. tax code starting in 2025 and 2026. These include a higher cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions, new limitations on itemized deductions and some limited exemptions for tip and overtime income. Find Out: The Estate Planning Secret the IRS Doesn’t Want You To Know, According To John Liang Read Next: Warren Buffett: 10 Things Poor People Waste Money On “Proper tax planning requires a thorough understanding of the current tax law and how it affects your financial picture,” said Brian Tullio, JD, a CFP at Fairway Wealth Management. “The ‘OBBB’ brings a host of changes to various individual tax provisions, often with new phase-out or AGI (adjusted gross income) limitations.” We spoke with Tullio and Matt McKinney, senior director and tax expert at Source Advisors, to break down what’s changing, who should act now and who might be better off waiting. Several provisions of the bill are poised to be retroactive to 2025 or take effect in 2026, and they may drastically shift how Americans approach tax planning. McKinney said the bill introduces “several permanent tax changes effective in 2025, including permanent 100% bonus depreciation starting for property acquired after Jan. 19, 2025; a permanent 20% qualified business income (QBI) deduction for pass-through business owners; [and] permanent research and experimental (R\u0026E) expensing.” Other key provisions include: A new $40,000 cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions, with a phase-out for incomes over $500,000 A deduction of up to $25,000 in tip income and $12,500 in overtime pay for taxpayers under $150,000 AGI A new limit on itemized deduction values, capped at a 35% benefit for high earners, starting in 2026 Your tax strategy depends on understanding when these provisions take effect, however. “Shifting income between tax years must be timed accordingly to ensure the applicable changes in tax policy provide the targeted benefit,” Tullio said.
