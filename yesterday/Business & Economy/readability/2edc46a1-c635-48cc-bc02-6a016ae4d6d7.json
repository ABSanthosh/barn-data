The Trump administration, he said, is \"working toward deals\" with those countries.\"It is highly likely,\" said Bessent, that for those countries and trading blocs, like the European Union, \"who are negotiating in good faith,\" the U.S. would \"roll the date forward to continue good faith negotiations.\"\"If someone is not negotiating, then we will not,\" he told the House's tax writing committee.Until now, Trump administration officials have not suggested that they are open to moving back the 90-day tariff pause without at least \"terms of an agreement\" before the pause expires.Bessent's remarks indicate that the Trump administration might be more inclined to shift the self-imposed deadline as it gets closer.President Donald Trump's 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, announced on April 9, is set to end in less than a month.Trump officials have repeatedly said they are close to inking trade deals with half a dozen countries. But so far, the White House has only announced a formal trade agreement with the U.K. and a framework agreement with China.The U.S.- China deal was announced earlier on Wednesday, but the full details of the agreement were unclear.Read more CNBC politics coverageBessent floats extending tariff pause for countries in 'good faith' trade talksFulbright board quits, claims Trump administration politicized scholarshipsU.S. tariffs on China won't change again, Lutnick says after trade talksTrump says China will supply rare earths in 'done' dealFund managers lobby Congress over Section 899 to avert foreign investors leaving the U.S.Trump authorizes deploying 2,000 more National Guard troops to LA'Trump accounts' for newborns: President, CEOs promote savings plansChina and U.S. set to continue trade talks as Trump touts 'good reports' from LondonSpeaker Johnson hopes Musk and Trump can 'reconcile' after public fallout",
