The promoter stake will fall to over 69% after the IPO from nearly 94%.Of the fresh issue proceeds, ₹70 crore will be used to expand the capacity of the crane unit, ₹50 crore for part debt repayment, and ₹45 crore for increasing the capital base of the tractor financing subsidiary. Currently, the company's financial parameters lag peers while the asked price-earnings (P/E) looks stretched due to the impact of higher interest outgo on the bottom line. However, the planned capacity expansion, debt repayment, and strengthening of the financing arm are expected to brighten prospects. Given these factors, long-term investors with high risk appetite may consider the IPO.AgenciesBusiness: Incorporated in 1994, Indo Farm's manufacturing facilities located in Baddi, Himachal Pradesh, have capacities of 12,000 tractors and 1,280 cranes per annum as of September 2024. Tractors contribute around 49% to revenue and cranes 45%, while the remainder is from related products. The company derives 7% of its revenue from exports to regions including Africa, Latin America, the Gulf, and Central and South Asia. It produces 16-110 HP tractors and cranes with a capacity between nine and 30 tonnes. It currently runs the crane facility at near capacity and plans to add a capacity of 3,600 tonnes. Besides, the augmentation of the capital base of the financing subsidiary will improve financing to tractor customers, which may support capacity utilisation of the tractor division, which was around 25% in FY24.Financials: Revenue from operations increased to ₹375.2 crore in FY24 from ₹352 crore in FY22 while net profit rose to ₹15.6 crore from ₹13.7 crore. The operating margin before depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda margin) expanded to 16.7% from 14.8% during the period. Total debt gradually reduced to ₹302 crore as of June 2024 from ₹345 crore in FY22. The debt reduction after the IPO is likely to reduce the interest burden by around 18%. The company incurred an interest outgo of ₹28.3 crore in FY24. In addition, net debt/ Ebitda at over four in FY24 was on the higher side. It is expected to fall amid debt repayment and likely improvement in business.Valuation: Indo Farm's price-earnings (P/E) multiple works out to be 66, which is steeper compared with 48 for Action Construction and 29 for Escorts Kubota. However, on an EV (enterprise value)/Ebitda basis, which excludes the impact of interest outgo, Indo Farm demands a multiple of over 17 compared with 31 for Action and 26 for Escorts Kubota.Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2024 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
