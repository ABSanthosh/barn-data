  "text": "Investing.com-- Shares of Star Entertainment Group Ltd (ASX:) fell on Monday after the company reported a loss in the second quarter amid regulatory woes. The Australian casino operator reported a loss before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization of A$8 million for the quarter ending December 31, an improvement from the A$18 million loss in the first quarter. Star shares fell nearly 4% to A$0.135 on Monday. Loss narrowed as operating expenses decreased during the quarter, reflecting efforts to streamline operations amid a challenging consumer environment. However, revenue declined by 15% to A$299 million, indicating ongoing pressures on the company's top line. The company has faced multiple inquiries into its operations, particularly regarding compliance lapses related to anti-money laundering and governance practices. To stabilize its business, Star Entertainment has implemented cost-cutting measures and operational streamlining, but persistent headwinds such as weak consumer confidence, reduced gambling activity, and regulatory reforms continue to weigh on its recovery prospects.",
