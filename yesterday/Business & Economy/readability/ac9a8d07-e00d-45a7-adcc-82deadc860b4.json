Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesIntel reported second-quarter results on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations on revenue, as the company's new CEO Lip-Bu Tan announced significant cuts in chip factory construction. The stock fell about 5% in extended trading. Here's how the chipmaker did versus LSEG consensus estimates:Earnings per share: Loss of 10 cents per share, adjusted.Revenue: $12.86 billion versus $11.92 billion estimatedIntel said it expects revenue for the third-quarter of $13.1 billion at the midpoint of its range, versus the average analyst estimate of $12.65 billion. The chipmaker said that it expects to break even on earnings while analysts were looking for earnings of 4 cents per share.For the second quarter, Intel reported a net loss of $2.9 billion, or 67 cents per share, compared with a $1.61 billion net loss, or 38 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Earnings per share were not comparable to analyst estimates due to an $800 million impairment charge, \"related to excess tools with no identified re-use,\" the company said. That resulted in an EPS adjustment of about 20 cents.The report was Intel's second since Lip-Bu Tan took over as CEO in March, promising to make the chipmaker's products competitive again, and to reduce bureaucracy and layers of management, including slashing staff in Oregon and California.In a memo to employees published on Thursday, Tan said that the first few months of his tenure had \"not been easy.\" He said that the company had \"completed the majority\" of its planned layoffs, amounting to 15% of the workforce, and that it plans to end the year with 75,000 employees. Intel previously said it was trying to reduce operating expenses by $17 billion in 2025.Intel shares are up about 13% this year as of Thursday's close after plummeting 60% in 2024, their worst year on record.Tan also announced several other spending cuts in the memo, particularly in the company's costly foundry division, which makes chips for other companies and is still looking for a big customer to anchor the business.Intel said its foundry business had an operating loss of $3.17 billion on $4.4 billion in revenue.Tan said that Intel had cancelled planned fab projects in Germany and Poland, and will consolidate its testing and assembly operations in Vietnam and Malaysia. He added that the company would slow down the pace of its construction of a cutting-edge chip factory in Ohio, depending on market demand and if it can secure big customers for the facility.\"Over the past several years, the company invested too much, too soon – without adequate demand,\" Tan wrote. \"In the process, our factory footprint became needlessly fragmented and underutilized.\"Tan wrote that the company's forthcoming chip manufacturing process, called 14A, will be built out based on confirmed customer commitments.\"There are no more blank checks. Every investment must make economic sense,\" Tan wrote.The company's client computing group, which is primarily comprised of sales of central processors for PCs, had $7.9 billion in sales, down 3% on an annual basis.Revenue in the data center group, which includes some AI chips but is mostly central processors for servers, rose 4% to $3.9 billion. Tan wrote in his memo that Intel wants to regain market share in data center chips, and is looking for a permanent leader for the business. Longtime rival Advanced Micro Devices has increasingly been winning server business from cloud customers.Tan added he would personally review and approve all chip designs before they are taped out, which is the final step of the design process before a new chip is manufactured.WATCH: How U.S. companies are mitigating Trump tariffs with foreign trade zones",
