  "text": "Suze Orman recently dropped a golden nugget of financial wisdom on her podcast, urging listeners to consider only having Roth retirement accounts. “The best way to prepare for retirement is to only have Roth retirement accounts – bar none,” she said. Her advice is aimed at avoiding the dreaded \"tax torpedo,\" which has left many retirees shocked by unexpected taxes on their Social Security benefits. Don't Miss: The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare? Can you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? – How does it compare to the average? This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10. So, what exactly is the tax torpedo? It's a sneaky tax that hits when your combined income pushes past certain thresholds. If you’re single and your income surpasses $34,000 or if you’re a married couple earning more than $44,000, up to 85% of your Social Security benefits can be taxed. Even at lower income levels – between $25,000 and $34,000 for individuals or $32,000 to $44,000 for couples – 50% of your benefits could be taxed. According to the Social Security Administration, nearly 40% of beneficiaries are affected by this tax. And depending on where you live, state taxes might pile on as well, worsening the blow. Trending:Studies show 50% of consumers think Financial Advisors cost much more than they do — to debunk this, this company provides matching for free and a complimentary first call with the matched advisor. The good news is that Roth retirement accounts can help you dodge this torpedo. Qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA (after age 59½ and meeting the five-year rule) are tax-free and don't count toward your combined income, keeping you below those critical taxation thresholds. Orman's advice is crystal clear: it's time to reconsider how you’re saving for retirement. In a recent blog post, Orman urged retirees to regularly review their portfolios, stating, \"You should log in and make sure your mix of investments – stocks, bonds and cash – is in line with your long-term goals.\" Trending: Beating the market through ethical real estate investing' — this platform aims to give tenants equity in the homes they live in while scoring 17.17% average annual returns for investors – here’s how to join with just $100 One potential addition to that plan is a gold IRA, a smart hedge against inflation and market volatility. While income from a gold IRA will be taxable, it offers a risk-adjusted complement to the Roth IRA. With physical assets like gold, retirees have another layer of security during market swings.",
