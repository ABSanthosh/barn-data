Most insurance companies rely heavily on this channel for selling their products. According to reports, the insurance sector regulator wants companies to rely less on this sales channel. While the revised surrender value rules are expected to hurt companies' margins, analysts said uncertainty over the impending Insurance Amendment Bill is also weighing down their shares.\"The insurance sector may continue to underperform in the near term until there is meaningful growth in premiums and margins stabilise,\" said Nilesh Shetty, portfolio manager- Quantum Advisors.Most insurance stocks have underperformed the broader market in the past year with SBI Life Insurance and HDFC Life Insurance declining 3% and 9%, respectively, in the period. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance shares rose 25.3% in the past year and LIC advanced 14.8%. The Nifty 50 gained 17.9% and Nifty 500 jumped 24.5% in the past year.\"The higher growth in ULIPs for life insurers is putting pressure on the value of new business margin and along with all the other concerns is weighing heavily on investor confidence,\" said ChouhanA reduction in GST rates for insurance products may result in a temporary rebound in these shares but that may not be enough to revive the sector's prospects, said analysts.Time to buy?Brokerage Emkay Global said the recent sharp correction in share prices seems to be already pricing in these uncertainties.\"After the correction, valuations have turned attractive, as once the uncertainties lose steam, listed private life insurers will retain their edge with a stronger brand, bigger scale, and better operational efficiencies,\" said Avinash Singh and Mahek Shah of Emkay Global, in a note to their clients.The firm has a 'Buy' recommendation for HDFC Life Insurance and 'Add' rating for IPRU Life, MAX Financial, SBI Life and LIC.Shetty said patient investors could selectively add these stocks to their portfolio as valuations have come off and risk-reward is favourable.\"The long-term growth potential of the life insurance sector remains intact. Steep declines present opportunities to invest in quality names within the sector. Private life insurers, particularly ICICI Prudential Life and HDFC Life, appear appealing after the correction and are 'buys' for long-term investors,\" said Chouhan.Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2024 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
