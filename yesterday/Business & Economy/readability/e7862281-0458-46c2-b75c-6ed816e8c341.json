These days, though, with skyrocketing costs and social media awash with luxury-laden highlights, it can feel like everyone's got a cool million in their back pocket. The truth? That's more illusion than reality. As financial guru Dave Ramsey put it: \"8 out of 10 people probably can't afford the home they're living in and the car they're driving.\" Don't Miss: CD Popularity Soars: Over 50 Million Americans Embrace Safe Savings with 5–10% Annual Growth Many are using this retirement income calculator to check if they’re on pace — here’s a breakdown on how on what’s behind this formula. Social media tends to amplify what looks like wealth, leading to this widespread perception that everyone's swimming in money. But peek behind the scenes and it's clear that not as many people are flush with cash as it seems. So, let's break it down – how many Americans have a net worth of $1 million or more? Spoiler Alert: It's Not As Many As You'd Think According to the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances by the Federal Reserve, only about 12% of U.S. households have a net worth over $1 million. This means that the vast majority – 88% – are nowhere near that level. Keep in mind that this is \"household\" net worth, which likely assumes a two-person income and combined assets. Wealth is highly concentrated and while the average U.S. household net worth is $1.06 million, the median net worth is much lower, at $192,700. Translation: A few very wealthy households are driving up the average but most people are much closer to that median number. Trending: Warren Buffett Flipped His Neighbor's $67,000 Life Savings Into A $50 Million Fortune — This Would Be Worth Over $500 Million Today Where Are the Millionaires? Certain states and age groups stand out for context. New Jersey, for instance, has the highest rate of millionaire households – about 9.76% of homes there have a net worth over $1 million. Age-wise, those between 65 and 74 have the highest average net worth at $1.2 million but the median for that same group is just $266,400. In other words, while some retirees have saved a bundle, many are just getting by. 401(k) balances tell a similar story. The average 401(k) balance for Americans aged 65 and older is $272,588 but the median is just $88,488 – meaning half of people have less than that amount saved. What Does It Mean to Have $1 Million? A net worth of $1 million isn't the same as having that amount sitting in the bank. Net worth includes assets like home equity, investments and retirement accounts – things that aren't easily converted to cash. And with inflation driving up living costs, many Americans now consider $2.2 million the new minimum to feel \"wealthy.\"",
