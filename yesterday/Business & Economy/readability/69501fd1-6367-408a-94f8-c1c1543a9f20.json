They also said he has lived in the U.S. for a decade without ever being charged with a crime.In a statement attached to the Supreme Court's order, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who was joined by fellow justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, wrote, \"To this day, the Government has cited no basis in law for Abrego Garcia's warrantless arrest, his removal to El Salvador, or his con- confinement in a Salvadoran prison. Nor could it.\"\"The Government remains bound by an Immigration Judge's 2019 order expressly prohibiting Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador because he faced a 'clear probability of future persecution' there and \"demonstrated that [El Salvador's] authorities were and would be unable or unwilling to protect him.\" Sotomayor wrote. \"Instead of hastening to correct its egregious error, theGovernment dismissed it as an 'oversight.' \"Sotomayor wrote that the government's only argument is that U.S. courts cannot grant relief to a deportee crosses the border.That \"is plainly wrong,\" she said.",
