Reports have indicated that InsuranceDekho is in advanced talks to merge with RenewBuy in a cash-and-stock deal, which could value the combined entity at Rs 8,000 crore. Under this arrangement, InsuranceDekho is expected to be valued at Rs 5,000 crore, while RenewBuy may be valued at Rs 3,000 crore. “We are in very early stages of exploratory discussions to create a larger, consolidated entity. If realised, it has the potential to make this establishment an undisputed category leader,” RenewBuy said. It added that the company is of the belief that a mega consolidation in this category (online insurance distribution) will be greatly beneficial for all the stakeholders – consumers, agent distributors, insurers, employees, and shareholders.  “As a dominant, growing player in the Insurtech space, we continuously explore various business opportunities and growth avenues alongside multiple industry partners to build a robust organisation,” the company said.More From This Section However, RenewBuy did not provide any specific details regarding the merger. It stated, “These are just preliminary and exploratory discussions, and the specifics of the deal are far from being finalised. It is too early for us to comment further on this.” InsuranceDekho declined to comment.   Online insurance distributors are intermediaries who provide an interface to the insurance prospects for price comparison and information of products of different insurers and other related matters.
