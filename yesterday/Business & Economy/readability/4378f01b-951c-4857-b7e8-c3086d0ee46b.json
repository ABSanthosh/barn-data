Zelenskyy on Tuesday ruled out the idea of Ukraine ceding territory to Russia as part of any agreement before high-level talks set for Wednesday in London among US, European and Ukrainian officials. There is nothing to talk about it is our land, the land of the Ukrainian people, Zelenskyy said. During similar talks last week in Paris, US officials presented a proposal that included allowing Russia to keep control of occupied Ukrainian territory as part of a deal, according to a European official familiar with the matter who was not authorised to comment publicly and spoken on the condition of anonymity. This statement is very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia in that Crimea was lost years ago under the auspices of President Barack Hussein Obama, and is not even a point of discussion, Trump wrote on Truth Social on Wednesday.(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)More From This SectionDon't miss the most important news and views of the day.
