However, this was challenged by IDBITSL before the Supreme Court, which had on January 31, 2025, directed the Chennai bench of NCLAT to dispose of the pending appeal before February 21, 2025. The apex court had also directed that if the appeal filed by CDEL is not disposed of by NCLAT, then the order passed by the appellate tribunal staying the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) shall stand vacated automatically. Updating the status, CDEL in a regulatory filing on Sunday informed: \"The arguments in NCLAT are ongoing and in parallel the parties are negotiating for settlement.\"  The settlement proposal is subject to final approval of both the parties and necessary documentation, it added.Also Read \"The company will take all the necessary steps in the best interest of the company,\" the filing said. On August 8, the Bengaluru bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) admitted the plea filed by IDBI Trusteeship Services Ltd (IDBITSL) claiming a default of Rs 228.45 crore and appointed an interim resolution professional to take care of the operation of the debt-ridden company. CDEL is the parent company of Coffee Day Group which operates the Cafe Coffee Day chain of coffee houses.
