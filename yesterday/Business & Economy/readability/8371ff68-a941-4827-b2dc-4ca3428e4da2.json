Even its most avid Wall Street bulls are turning cautious. But one group is buying the electric-vehicle maker’s shares like never before: CEO Elon Musk’s fans. Most Read from Bloomberg Chicago Transit Faces ‘Doomsday Scenario,’ Regional Agency Says New York Subway Ditches MetroCard After 32 Years for Tap-And-Go LA Faces $1 Billion Budget Hole, Warns of Thousands of Layoffs Despite Cost-Cutting Moves, Trump Plans to Remake DC in His Style Amtrak CEO Departs Amid Threats of a Transit Funding Pullback The company has long had an ardent fan base of individual investors who hang on Musk’s every word on X, the social-media platform he owns. They analyze Tesla in great detail in online forums and largely function as a hype crew for the stock. But their current level of enthusiasm is staggeringly high, even by recent historical standards. Individual investors have been net buyers of Tesla shares for 13 straight sessions through Thursday, pumping $8 billion into the stock, retail trading data from JPMorgan Chase’s global equity derivatives strategist Emma Wu shows. That’s the biggest inflow over any buying streak since 2015, which is as far back as the data goes. What makes the retail buying notable is Tesla’s share price has sunk 17% over this time, wiping out more than $155 billion from its market value. “I’ve missed several opportunities with TSLA in the past. Now that the stock has dropped significantly, could this be a good time to invest?,” wrote the author of a post on the Reddit forum for Tesla traders. Another said they were “very happy” to buy the stock at a $225-$230 range. The shares closed up 5.3% at $248.66 on Friday. “Tesla made some rookie to mid-stage public market investors extremely wealthy, a lot of people became millionaires because of this stock,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder at DataTrek Research. “People don’t forget that. And they will come back to a stock again and again if they feel it has been beaten up.” Tesla shares have been on a steep slide since mid-December when it touched an all-time high fueled by optimism from Donald Trump’s election victory. But that euphoria vanished, with the stock retreating more than 50% from its Dec. 17 record, making it the second-biggest decliner in the S\u0026P 500 Index this year. The rout has been so brutal that on Thursday, Musk sought to reassure Tesla employees during an all-hands meeting, likely sparking the rebound in the shares on Friday. The enthusiasm was palpable on X, formerly Twitter, where the stock was heavily mentioned, while on Stocktwits — another online forum for individual traders — Tesla topped the list of the website’s most active securities on Friday.",
