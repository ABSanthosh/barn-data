This was led by expectations of a cut in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) requirement in the monetary policy on Friday, along with short covering of positions by foreign traders.The NSE Nifty rose 240.95 points or 0.98% to close at 24,708.4. The BSE Sensex rose 809.53 points or 1% to end at 81,765.86. Both indices have moved up 3.3-3.4% in the past five trading days.While the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to keep the benchmark repo rate unchanged, it may cut the CRR in order to boost liquidity in the economy, analysts said. FPIs Bought Shares Worth Net ₹8,540 cr \"All eyes are now on the RBI policy meet to decide how to react to this sudden slump, as India's GDP increased 5.4% year-on-year in the July-September quarter - much less than the market had predicted,\" said Aamar Deo Singh, senior vice president of research at Angel One. Singh said that a decrease in the CRR, which is currently at 4.5%, would be advantageous to banks and financials' shares since it would increase their flexible resources and, consequently, their profitability, as evidenced by the recent spike in banking stocks. \"Additionally, the US Fed chairman's remarks on the US economy's better-than-expected performance and the rupee's decline have given IT equities a boost,\" Singh said.The Nifty's information technology index was the top gainer of the day, along with spikes in the oil and gas, bank, financial services and auto indices. Foreign portfolio investors (FPI) bought shares worth a net Rs 8,540 crore. Domestic institutions were sellers to the tune of Rs 2,304 crore.AgenciesFear gauge up 0.53%Nifty's India Volatility Index or VIX went up 0.53% to 14.53 at the close on Thursday. It had dropped about 10% in the past month.\"FIIs (foreign institutional investors) had built significant short positions in the market and with Nifty rebounding from its 200 DEMA (day exponential moving average) level, we have seen a short covering in these positions, taking the markets higher,\" said Ruchit Jain, vice president at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.Jain said that the Nifty has already retraced 50% of its correction from its highs of 26,200 and it currently has a good chance of going to 25,200 levels, as long as the index is above 24,300.Nifty closed at a high of 26,216 on September 26 and fell to a closing low of 23,350 on November 21.Banks \u0026 IT show\"Heavyweights like banks and IT have started contributing to the up move,\" said Jain. \"However, volatility is expected to remain high in the coming days, as seen on Thursday. With RBI's monetary policy announcement on Friday, rate-sensitive sectors like banks and real estate could do well if the policy is favourable.\"The Nifty Midcap 150 gained 0.43% and Nifty Small-cap 250 rose 0.48%. Out of the total 4,083 stocks traded on the BSE, 2,048 advanced and 1,931 declined on Thursday.Elsewhere in Asia, China advanced 0.1%, Hong Kong and South Korea both fell 0.9%, and Taiwan remained flat at the close.The pan-Europe index Stoxx 600 was up 0.2% at the time of going to print.Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2024 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
